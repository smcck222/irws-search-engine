  [Text] In Niger, there was a violent clash in the north of 
the country on 16 May between the Tuareg rebels and the 
government forces. The toll seems to be quite high, Christophe 
Boisbouvier: 
  [Boisbouvier] Yes, according to several sources, this, the 
most violent clash in a year, took place in a village of 3,000 
inhabitants, called (Tiama), in the Air mountains, about 200 Km 
north of Agades, on Monday afternoon. The army, equipped with 
machineguns, and a rebel unit of (Mohamed Anoko's) Popular Front 
for the Liberation of the Sahara were involved in the clash. 
The toll is not yet clearly established, but according to rebel 
sources 24 were killed on the government side and 16 on the 
rebel side, eight of them being killed after being captured, but 
it is impossible to confirm these figures at the moment. 
  This incident looks as though it could relaunch the war in 
these mountains in northern Niger after several weeks of 
relative calm. However, the two sides appear to be still 
prepared to sit at the negotiating table, perhaps in Paris in 
mid-June. It is true that after the latest talks in Ouagadougou 
no cease-fire was concluded.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] As preparations are in top gear for the election of 
delegates to the proposed national constitutional conference at 
ward level on Monday [23 May], calls have heightened for the 
boycott of the conference. THE VANGUARD and THE GUARDIAN report 
that the boycott call by a pressure group, the National 
Democratic Coalition, NADECO, appears to be catching attention, 
especially in the western part of the country. THE VANGUARD 
says NADECO members have agreed to withdraw from the polls. The 
NATIONAL CONCORD says Anang people in Akwa Ibom State and some 
key democrats in Ogun State have indicated their intention to 
boycott the gathering. The TIMES says as preparations for 
Monday polls continue, prominent musical actors have declared 
support for calls on government to shelve the conference.

  [Text] In Nigeria, government preparations for the 
election of delegates to the forthcoming National Constitutional 
Conference are going ahead, but equally, a campaign to call the 
whole thing off is also gaining momentum. At the center of 
these demands for a boycott of the conference is the newly 
formed National Democratic Coalition, and as Sola Odunfa now 
reports from Lagos, the coalition's efforts are doing 
particularly well in Western Nigeria: 
  [Begin Odunfa recording] The boycott campaign, spearheaded 
by the National Democratic Coalition, appears to be spreading. 
The support for a boycott of the Constitutional Conference is 
gaining popularity, especially among political leaders in 
Western Nigeria, home of Chief Moshood Abiola, the acclaimed 
leader of last year's annulled presidential election. Nearly 
all the major political leaders in the Yoruba-speaking west say 
that they have withdrawn from the first stage election, 
scheduled to be held on Monday. 
  Chief (Shegun Oshoba), the last civilian governor of Ogun 
State says Nigeria is facing a crisis more important than the 
constitutional conference, and the crisis should first be 
resolved by reviewing the annulment of the presidential 
election. Chief Michael Ajasi, who claims political leadership 
of the Yoruba people, says none of the prominent politicians who 
collected nomination forms in his home state, Ondo, returned 
them. Significantly, the former national chairman of the 
disbanded National Republican Convention, NRC, Dr. Hameed 
Kusamotu, while not explicitly endorsing the boycott campaign, 
called on the government to first convene a meeting of all 
leaders of thought in the country to discuss the state of the 
nation before the planned constitutional conference. 
  Preparations are in top gear in other parts of Nigeria to 
ensure the success of the election of delegates. The current 
situation suggests that the boycott, if it is effective, will be 
only in the western states, and this will mean the absence of 
credible Yoruba leaders from the constitutional conference. [end 
recording] 
  Well as you heard, the campaign of the National Democratic 
Coalition has been doing rather well in the south and southwest 
of Nigeria. One of the prime movers of the boycott campaign of 
the National Democratic Coalition is retired Admiral (Ndibisi 
Godwin Kanu). On the line to Lagos, Mustapha Ibrahim asked him 
what the coalition's boycott call was all about: 
  [Begin recording] [(Kanu)] The call is really expressing the 
true wishes of Nigerians from all over the country. What 
Nigerians want is a sovereign national conference, where issues 
of proper federalism and other restructuring will be done. So 
it is more of voicing out entirely what the people want. 
  [Ibrahim] The National Democratic Coalition seems to have 
brought together a lot of people from only a certain part of the 
country. What effort has the movement made to become a 
broad-based, national movement? 
  [(Kanu)] As you know, Nigeria is made up really of many 
nations. It is a country of many nations. You mention the few 
from what you may call the southwestern part, or you may say the 
Yoruba nation. I am not from the Yoruba nation. There are 
people from the middle belt, there are people from the far north 
-- you have Dambazau there -- but more than that, as I said, it 
is not just a matter of the individuals you are looking at on 
the paper, but a matter of all well-meaning Nigerians, and they 
are all over the place. 
  [Ibrahim] Don't you fear being accused of being lackeys of 
Chief M.K.O. Abiola? 
  [(Kanu)] The issue of Abiola is absolutely secondary. 
Nigerians were called out to vote and they all voted -- and it 
was a very peaceful and fair election in this country -- and it 
got annulled. The people came out to vote and they left 
everything else, ethnic considerations, religious bias, and 
voted. It was very peaceful, and in a very good spirit of 
brotherhood, and that is the position. So it isn't a matter of 
Abiola at all. He may have his faults, he may have his good 
points, but that is not what people are saying. They exercised 
a franchise and they want to exercise that, and it is not a 
matter of being a lackey to him. He is rather talking about our 
national interest, and that goes for everybody, whether in the 
present provisional government or outside of it. We have to 
look at that, and the intention is to have a proper federalism 
and a structure where there is a sense of belonging to 
everybody. Right now, nothing is moving because patriotism is 
not there. 
  [Ibrahim] Now, what will happen if the present military 
regime defies this ultimatum that the National Democratic 
Coalition has given that it must step down by May 31? 
  [(Kanu)] We believe it is in the interests of everybody, 
including even those now in the government, to achieve this 
democracy in accordance with the June 12 election and mandate. 
We believe also they ought to consider it that way. It isn't a 
matter of any challenge -- it is a simple matter that we, all of 
us Nigerians, including those of them that are in government -- 
a few of them who are in the military and in government. The 
bulk of the Armed Forces too is having things very rough. [end

  [Excerpts] The UNHCR has accused the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] of killing Rwandan civilians. This is according to 
a UNHCR member based in Tanzania, who received his information 
from refugees arriving in Tanzania. The so-called investigator 
claims to have received the information, but did not furnish any 
proof. [passage omitted] 
  The UNHCR has not shown any credibility concerning these 
allegations, because they have not taken into account reports by 
those who have visited territory controlled by the Rwandan 
Patriotic Army, such as Mr. (Anderson) of the BBC, who declared 
that he had visited the area and witnessed that the RPF was not 
committing atrocities. If the UNHCR has seen civilians being 
massacred, why does it not send representatives to see what is 
happening in areas occupied by government forces? Why should 
the UNHCR condemn the RPF on the basis of false rumors without, 
up to now, condemning the Gitarama government? It is well known 
that the RPF allows anyone interested in visiting the territory 
under its control to do so freely. That is why international 
journalists continue to visit these areas. They have witnessed 
for themselves the brutality with which the puppet government of 
Rwanda committed genocide. 
  The UNHCR, which acquired its information from the most 
partisan of sources -- fleeing criminals [words indistinct], is 
now accusing the RPF. This will just encourage the criminal 
Gitarama government. The same UNHCR has not even condemned the 
government. This is the first time that members of the 
organization have accused the RPF. It should be recalled that 
last month they spread lies, according to which the RPF had 
closed the Rusumo border, so as to stop people from fleeing to 
Tanzania. 
  Fortunately, [words indistinct] and humanitarian 
organizations have done everything possible to show that this is 
not correct. One can ask why the UNHCR does not go to see what 
is happening in the area controlled by the government army, what 
is happening in Gikongoro, Cyangugu, and Kibuye, for example. 
It is well known that the genocide already has been completed 
in those three prefectures, according to the words of Mr. 
Theodore Sindikubwabo who, during his visit the day before 
yesterday to Kibuye and Cyangugu, thanked the killers for 
cleaning up Kibuye Prefecture. This refers to the extermination 
of all Tutsis and all non-extremist Hutus. 
  It is regrettable that the UNHCR does not seem to give any 
importance to the horror, and just keeps on wrongly accusing the 
RPF of committing crimes, basing its opinion on the incoherent 
allegations of those killers who fled after decimating innocent 
people.

  [Excerpts] The Rwandese Patriotic Army [RPA] chairman high 
command, Major General Paul Kagame, in an interview with 
(Shakasari) on Voice of America, said that armed militias at the 
frontline are legitimate targets. This was a reaction to an 
accusation that RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] killed civilians. 
[passage omitted including indistinct portion] 
  On whether RPF's military objective is Kigali or Gitarama, 
Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame said that RPF's military objective is the 
whole country, this is in order to rescue civilians in hiding 
which RPF has been doing. Concerning whether RPF helps 
civilians in their zones, chairman high command Maj. Gen. Paul 
Kagame said that services provided [words indistinct] above all 
security.

  [Text] We end our bulletin with a statement for people 
willing to take refuge in the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
zone, or in areas controlled by the RPF in Kigali. We inform 
those people in Kigali who are still hiding in their houses to 
try and take refuge in RPF-controlled areas. First we will list 
the Kigali neighborhoods, and then those areas where you can 
take refuge. Once you hear your suburb, you will then hear the 
nearest RPF position where you can take refuge. 
  People living in the areas of Mugima, Kabasengerezi, 
Rugenge, 
Nyamabuye, Kiyovu, and Cyimisagara can take refuge in one of the 
following places nearest to where they are. The safe areas 
would be Gasyata, Gisozi, Kagugu, Gaturiro, the Meridian Hotel, 
the King Faycal Hospital, the Egyptian Embassy, the U.S. 
Embassy, Kacyiru, and the parliament building. RPF personnel 
are positioned in those areas. 
  Those people living in Cyahafi, Kamuhoza, Gitega, Gikondo, 
Nyarugenge, Rugunga, (Mpababuturo), Nyakabanda, and Nyamirambo 
can take refuge in the following locations: the Rebero Hotel, 
(Gatenga), Murambi, Kicyukiro, (Ovibar), and Sonatube. People 
in the area of Kanombe Airport can take refuge in the following 
places: in Remera at Nsekarije, Masoro, Munini, and Kinunga in 
(Ndera). We hope that everyone heard the locations. You can 
see which suburb you live in, or the nearest RPF-occupied area, 
and you may then take refuge in that area to escape the 
Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development militias].

  [Excerpts] As you heard in our recent newscast, the entire 
Bugesera area is currently in the hands of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF]. Only Ngenda commune had previously remained, but 
it was captured yesterday. [passage omitted] It is in Ngenda 
that the Rwabayanga pit was found. News reached us saying that 
Rwabayanga was full of dead bodies. However, in Ngeda, the RPF 
was able to rescue people who were still hiding. Those 
government troops which are still fighting, those who had 
survived, fled yesterday to Muyira Commune in Butare. 
  However, government troops continue to damage the public 
infrastructure. The troops left after demolishing the Rwabusoro 
Bridge. This is a big bridge which links Ngenda Commune in 
Bugesera to Muyira Commune in Butare. The RPF is trying to 
rebuild the bridge, but those familiar with it say that it will 
not be easy. It is said that the Rwabusoro [words indistinct]

  [Text] Nairobi, 19 May (AFP) -- About 30 wounded people 
were killed in their beds when a mortar shell slammed into 
Kigali's main hospital early Thursday [19 May], a United Nations 
spokesman said, quoting reports by witnesses. UN officials were 
on their way to the hospital to check the report, spokesman 
Abdul Kabia said. It was unknown who had fired the mortar shell. 
  Fierce fighting between rebels and Army soldiers erupted 
overnight around Kigali Airport and prevented a UN relief plane 
from landing, Kabia said. Artillery and small arms fire resumed 
overnight in various parts of Rwanda's capital, which had been 
relatively quiet for several days. 
  UN officials shuttled between rebel and Army commanders 
Wednesday in their latest attempt to win an agreement to make 
the airport a UN-controlled neutral zone. But a spokesman for 
the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front said the airport remained a 
military target because it was surrounded by government 
artillery positions and there was a big Army camp nearby.

  [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, the 
president of the Republic, has hailed the Juba declaration 
issued by the forces of peace, who are currently meeting in 
Juba. He said the meeting was historic for Sudan in general and 
for the south in particular. The meeting had made positive 
progress on the path toward peace and national unity. He said 
this during his regular meeting today with media leaders at the 
secretariat general of the Council of Ministers. 
  Referring to the Nairobi peace talks, which began today 
under 
the auspices of the IGADD [Intergovernmental Authority on 
Drought and Development] states, his excellency the president 
said the talks were opening despite attempts to abort them by 
the rebels. He said the rebellion had hoped to abort the talks, 
in order to encourage foreign intervention in support of its 
position. Lt. Gen. 'Umar al- Bashir said he hoped the signing 
of the relief agreement between the government and the rebels 
yesterday would pave the way for relief to pour in to rescue 
those in need in the south. 
  During his meeting with the media leaders, the president of 
the Republic also reiterated Sudan's firm stance on the 
situation in Yemen. He said Sudan supported Yemen's unity and 
was wholly opposed to those undermining stability and unity in 
fraternal Yemen. The leader of the revolution appealed to the 
two conflicting sides in Yemen to resort to dialogue as a way of 
solving the dispute and overcoming the current situation. He 
said that Sudan would not intervene in the Yemeni conflict, and 
that it did not favor either party over the other. What 
concerned Sudan was the resolution of the conflict between 
brothers, who should seek a solution through Yemeni 
constitutional institutions to resolve the current situation.

<F P=106> [Report by Greta Steyn] </F>
  [Text] The ANC's think-tank, the National Institute for 
Economic Policy, has completed research showing the full cost of 
the reconstruction and development programme [RDP] will run into 
R[Rand]80bn-R90bn over five years. 
  The figure includes central government and parastatal 
spending, and no breakdown between the two components was 
available yesterday. 
  Before the election, ANC officials said the cost to central 
government would be R39bn over five years, but economists said 
the figure appeared understated within the context of the 
overall amount. 
  Institute head Max Sisulu confirmed the full programme would 
cost at least R80bn, but declined to say what portion would be 
financed via the Budget. He confirmed that spending in the 
fifth year of the programme was estimated at R39bn (including 
parastatal expenditure). Private sector expenditure, for 
instance on housing, was not included in the estimate. Housing 
would be financed mainly via the Budget. 
  He said the institute's task had been to identify savings 
within the existing Budget and the scope for further spending, 
given conservative assumptions. These assumptions meant in the 
short-term there was little that could change. As the programme 
went on, the assumptions could be relaxed. 
  Key assumptions for the first two years included that there 
would be no foreign grants, no major taxation changes and no 
further selling of strategic stockpiles. But the situation was 
assumed to have changed in later years. 
  The model also assumed a given GDP growth rate, inflation 
and 
remuneration packages in the short-run. 
  Criteria had been drawn up to rank programmes in order of 
importance. A major effort had been made to link the RDP to 
budgetary planning, hence this emphasis. 
  Sisulu, who is an ANC MP, said he expected the research to 
be 
released soon. 
  The Development Bank has drawn up a model costing a 
programme 
similar to the RDP, and found that overall spending (government 
and parastatal) of almost R57bn over five years would cause 
government debt to explode. Such a progamme would be 
unsustainable even if the economy grew at almost 6 percent by 
the end of the period.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo says there is no 
truth in reports that South Africa could send soldiers to 
Rwanda. Mr. Nzo said in a statement in Pretoria that the reports 
were based partially on incomplete information on South Africa's 
possible reaction to steps that could be taken by the UN to end 
the conflict in Rwanda. He said although South Africa was 
extremely concerned about the slaughter in Rwanda, the 
government would have to consult with other African countries 
and the UN before taking a decision on any peace initiatives.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with SANDF Chief Georg Meiring by </F>
reporter Donald Pressly; place and date not given] 
  [Text] As long as there are men with weapons in their 
hands, there will always be a danger that they will use them in 
an undisciplined way, says the chief of the SA [South Africa] 
National Defence Force [SANDF], General Georg Meiring. 
  Asked if the defence force will be a threat to the 
Government 
of National Unity, Meiring said the history of Africa showed 
that armies could well be a danger to democratic governments. 
  But he did not believe that the SANDF was such a threat. 
  "If a force is well-disciplined, the chances that it will be 
used indiscriminately are much lower," he said. 
  A defence force could only constitute a danger to the State 
if it was made up of a fulltime component which came under the 
influence of a specific body which wishes to overthrow the State. 
  It was for this reason that the former SADF [South African 
Defence Force] had questioned the African National Congress' 
reasoning that the SANDF should be made up only of volunteers. 
  "We said we should have both ... with the force made up 
largely of part-time soldiers drawn from the entire spectrum of 
society", he said. 
  The new system, while not placing emphasis on conscription, 
allowed for a volunteer programme coupled with a ballot system. 
Young men still had to register for the service and were liable 
for service should the country need them. 
  Turning to the integration of the liberation armies, the 
homeland military formations and the various arms of the SADF -- 
including the navy, air force, medical services and army -- into 
the new National Defence Force, he said all their cultures would 
have to be fully assimilated "so they make up the same 
substance." 
  There was a realisation "that oil and water do not mix". He 
and former Umkhonto [Spear of the nation; ANC military wing -- 
(MK] chief of staff and now Minister of Defence Joe Modise had 
agreed that a two-year period of bridging training was required 
to ensure equal opportunities for those lacking the skills of 
modern warfare. 
  Meiring said a two-year period of "bridging training" will 
be 
required to ensure that equal opportunities for all members of 
the new force were available. 
  There would be no tokenism with black people achieving top 
posts. "A high level of training at international military 
standard would have to be maintained," he said in an interview. 
If there are black people of sufficient merit in MK, for 
instance, to be generals, "there will be black generals." 
  The former SADF has not been completely representative of 
the 
various race groups in the past because of the political 
circumstances but he contends that it is the first major 
organisation in South Africa to take blacks on in large numbers 
12 years ago. 
  Blacks have reached the rank of major, captains and below. 
Training of coloureds started 19 years ago with one coloured man 
having reached the rank of brigadier. There are a number of 
colonels and commandants. "If we had started earlier we would 
have had black generals ... bearing in mind it takes 30 years to 
become a general. It's not something that happens overnight." 
  The SA Army is now one third black, one third brown, and one 
third white. 
  There will have to be rationalisation of the service as 
integration will lead to "a big fat service". The best man 
would therefore get the job. 
  Everybody will have to be trained to a specific level -- 
with 
some recruits needing more training than others. Air Force 
fighter pilots, for instance, will take longer than two years to 
achieve flying competence -- it takes seven years to train a man 
to reach standards of a Mirage pilot. 
  A tank commander will take longer to train than an 
infantryman, while to train a soldier to man a mortar takes less 
time that training him to fire an artillery gun. 
  "The eventual new defence force will not come into being 
overnight. Cultures will have to be assimilated. We must get 
people to believe in the same things, train together, play sport 
together and even make war together." 
  Outlining the differences between a liberation army, such as 
Umkhonto we Sizwe, and the SADF, he said the training MK had 
received was that of a freedom fighter. "It is totally 
different to the necessary skills for a conventional defence 
service." The SANDF believes that it is an apolitical 
organisation which serves the government of the day. "A soldier 
is a professional, highly trained, highly disciplined being with 
skills in a particular type of warfare. 
  "A freedom fighter behaves in a political way," he says. 
  Now freedom fighters have to be assimilated into the 
apolitical culture of the SANDF. He believes, however, that the 
culture of the defence force is so strong that there will be no 
need for a political reorientation of former freedom fighters. 
  His message to blacks who wish to join the defence force is 
that the SANDF is changing as the country was changing. "It is 
not an entity above the country or beyond it. 
  "We believe we are an apolitical, professional force that is 
from the people, for the people." 
  He hopes that the liberation armies will have a positive 
contribution to make on the emerging SANDF "that they will build 
it up rather than break it down". 
  Pondering the failings of the old SADF, he says the force 
has 
"done our job as we were given it to do. As part of the state 
system, one does good or as bad as the state tells one to do." 
  "The complexion of the State is now changing, therefore our 
complexion should also change." 
  Asked if he intended to hold on to his job, he said he was 
on 
a five-year contract and was more than willing to continue. "It 
depends of what the new government tells me to do," he said. 
  Should the new government turn into a one-party Marxist 
state, he said any officer who could not find it within himself 
to support the state would have to resign. 
  He did not believe, however, that it would become a Marxist 
state. 
  The various armies that are to make up the SANDF are being 
placed at assembly points to be integrated under the direction 
of the Joint Military Co-Ordinating Council.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg May 19 SAPA -- The National 
Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] will be disbanded within the next two 
weeks, Defence Ministry and NPKF Spokesmen said on Thursday. An 
announcement ending the NPKF's brief and inglorious life can be 
expected as early as next Tuesday after the cabinet meets in 
Cape Town. The actual disbandment could take place on June 2. 
  "Its disbandment is under consideration. I can't give an 
indication when an announcement can be expected but it could be 
soon," Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Charl de Klerk said. He 
said there was still a number of technical considerations, such 
as how NPKF members would be accommodated at their forces of 
origin. 
  NPKF spokesman Col Connie van Rensburg said the NPKF was 
waiting for an official announcement on its future. Asked 
whether it would be retained in another form, Col van Rensburg 
said: "I personally very much doubt it." 
  The NPKF was established in February. It was seldom out of 
the headlines as reports of ill-discipline and insubordination 
among the peace-keepers became commonplace. In military and 
political circles it was called the "national peace-keeping 
farce". 
  It was intended to keep peace during the election period. 
But after a disastrous first outing on the East Rand during 
which award-winning photographer Ken Oosterbroek was killed, the 
NPKF was withdrawn to barracks. 
  Col van Rensburg said the South African National Defence 
Force [SANDF] had already said it could accommodate about 1,200 
members of Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC armed 
wing] who comprise the non-statutory component of the NPKF. The 
Umkhonto members could be taken in at the SANDF assembly point 
at Wallmannstal, north of Pretoria. The matter was discussed at 
a meeting of the Joint Military Command Council [JMCC] in 
Pretoria on Wednesday morning. The JMCC is overseeing the 
restructuring and rationalisation of South Africa's statutory 
and non-statutory forces. 
  Col van Rensburg said the original agreement was that the 
2,800 members of statutory forces would be returned to their 
forces of origin, namely the South African Police, the Transkei 
Defence Force and the Venda Defence Force. He said legislation 
providing for the establishment of the NPKF in the form of the 
Transitional Executive Council act was no longer valid after the 
inauguration of President Nelson Mandela last week. 
Technically, the NPKF was now a non- statutory force. 
  Its members at De Brug in the Orange Free State and Koeberg 
in the Western Cape were sitting around doing nothing. He said 
training had stopped and the inactivity had potentially 
demoralising consequences.

<F P=106> [Report by Helen Grace] </F>
  [Text] More arrests are in the pipeline as the 
international team investigating the Goldstone Commission's 
allegations of police complicity in Third Force activities 
continues to probe criminal conduct in the police force. 
  The investigation -- which has already led to the arrest of 
four men including former Vlakplaas training camp commander 
Lieutenant- Colonel Eugene de Kock -- has expanded beyond the 
Goldstone Commission's allegations of gun smuggling to the IFP 
and is now embracing a diversity of other allegations. 
  The team is understood to be receiving information from a 
"deep throat" in the SAP [South African] about a secret police 
slush fund -- controlled by a division called Stratkom -- to 
finance disinformation about the ANC. 
  Several senior policemen said to be in charge of the 
operation, which was allegedly still operating late last year, 
are now under scrutiny. Sources close to the investigation 
team, led by Transvaal Attorney-General Jan D'Oliveira, declined 
to furnish any details on the team's work yesterday. One 
source said, however, that more arrests were likely in the near 
future. 
  The first men arrested once the team began its work on the 
Goldstone Commission report on arms smuggling were Captain de 
Kock, Sergeant Jannie Hannekom and Ben van Zyl, believed to have 
been a former detective at the Brixton Murder and Robbery Squad 
and latterly a police informer. 
  Last week, a man called James Ntsibande was also arrested in 
connection with evidence found by the investigation team. All 
the men are charged with murder and are in police custody. 
  De Kock and Hannekom are scheduled to appear in the Pretoria 
Regional Court again today, and Van Zyl and Ntsibande will 
appear in court tomorrow.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 18 SAPA -- Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] Chairman Judge Johann Kriegler said on 
Wednesday he would be available to run South Africa's next 
election if he was asked. The judge was speaking at the IEC's 
final media briefing at the IEC's Johannesburg headquarters on 
Wednesday. 
  He made his remarks as several hundred election monitors 
gathered outside the IEC's offices demanding a bonus of up to 
7,000 R[rand] each for overtime worked and for having helped to 
provide a free and fair election. 
  The day-long demonstration was just one of several that have 
occurred throughout the country in the wake of an election 
characterised by chaos and allegations of irregularities. 
  The judge said he would recommend that a skeleton IEC be 
kept 
running until the next elections due in 1999 and that these 
elections should not be run by a government department. 
  He said it was imperative that a voters' roll be prepared. 
  Asked whether he would be available to run the next 
elections, Mr. Kriegler said: "Yes, if they want me again. I 
think I've learnt too much to fall down the drain. If they are 
unwise enough to ask me again, I would probably be available," 
he said. 
  Mr Kriegler said he wanted to clear any mispreceptions that 
the final result came from haggling between the political 
parties and not from the IEC's own counting efforts. He said 
while parties had entered discussions on irregularities, the 
final results reflected what the IEC had counted. "The results 
we announced were totally and wholly based on our own count 
through our backup system," he said. 
  His deputy, Pretoria Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, said he 
would 
not be available to help with the next elections. "It was a 
challenging job and we enjoyed it," he said. He said the IEC 
had delivered to South Africa a new president and a new 
parliament. "We did it," he said. 
  Mr Moseneke, meanwhile, has been offered election monitoring 
posts in countries around the world, among them Mozambique, 
Denmark and Malawi. 
  The IEC will prepare a final electoral and financial report 
by the end of June.

  [Text] The minister of education, Professor Sibusiso Bengu, 
says black people will remain an underclass in the economy 
unless his department intervenes decisively to improve their 
educational qualifications. With this in mind, he said he had 
initiated a series of processes to bring about the restructuring 
of the education system. Prof. Bhengu said the directors 
general and other managers in the old system would remain in 
charge of their departments until the new system was in place.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the SA Communication Service on the </F>
SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] In his first address since becoming minister, Dr. 
Ngubane on Wednesday (18 May) addressed the staff of the Human 
Sciences Research Council in Pretoria. The minister was 
accompanied by the deputy minister of arts, culture, science and 
technology, Mrs. Winnie Mandela. 
  Dr. Ngubane invited all agencies in the field of science and 
technology to provide him with their views on how their work may 
best be directed at urgent socio-economic challenges. He added 
that appropriate research and development (R &amp; D) will have 
to 
become one of our weapons in the fight against poverty and 
inequality. 
  Dr. Ngubane gave a few pointers on how he saw issues of 
policy: 
  South Africa as a developing society, should ideally spend 
more 
  than the current roughly one per cent of GDP on research and 
  development 
  The state should shoulder a substantial part of this 
  expenditure, but also encourage the private sector to become 
  increasingly involved. 
  South Africa's base of scientists will have to be broadened, 
  especially at the historically black universities and 
technikons 
  Affirmative action in the research field should not take the 
  form of symbolic appointments. It must be based on 
empowerment 
  through training and human resource development. 
  Dr. Ngubane acknowledged that there are no easy answers. 
Therefore he could be expected to move cautiously after having 
studied each issue in all its ramifications.

<F P=106> [Joint communique issued by the Russian Federation and De </F>
Beers Consolidate Mines issued on 18 May on the SAPA PR Wire 
Service] 
  [Text] On 17th May, 1994 discussions were held in Moscow 
between a Russian delegation headed by the acting minister of 
finance, Sergey Dubinin and a delegation from De Beers 
Centenary, headed by the chairman of the Central Selling 
Organisation, Nicky Oppenheimer. 
  The new series of official discussions, of which this was 
the 
first, is aimed at considering modifications to the existing 
marketing agreement between Russia and De Beers in response to 
the political and socio-economic changes that have taken place 
in Russia since it was signed. Further meetings on the subject 
will take place in the near future. The parties remain 
committed to the existing agreement, pending their agreeing on 
any modification. They are also committed to the stability of 
the international diamond market and to taking the necessary 
steps to curtail Russian rough gem diamonds reaching the market 
outside the current marketing arrangements. 
  During the discussions the parties re-iterated their joint 
responsibility, as the world's two largest gem diamond 
producers, to the international diamond market and to the 
well-being of the world diamond community. The parties hope 
that the new series of discussions will re-establish a solid 
base for on-going co-operation into the future and thereby 
ensure the further development of the international diamond 
business, to their mutual benefit and to the benefit of the 
entire diamond industry.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Affirmative action"] </F>
  [Text] The device is not new. Directly or implicitly 
threaten government intervention if individuals or businesses do 
not voluntarily comply with a social engineering objective and 
hope the threat alone is sufficient to get compliance. 
Companies often give in, but grudgingly and with little 
commitment to a strategy that might be necessary for the 
national good. 
  So, when ANC economic adviser Don Mkhwanazi (speaking, of 
course, in his personal capacity) threatened dire legislative 
action unless business tackled the issue of affirmative action 
within 18 months and when the Black Management Forum's Lovemore 
Mbigi threatens that an ANC government will enforce racial 
employment quotas, the ground is not being laid for a 
cooperative approach to addressing the country's skills 
shortages. 
  Well before the election, ANC loose cannons threatened or 
promised all manner of things. The result was an understandable 
confusion among businessmen trying to discern an ANC party line. 
One point remains clear, however: coercion or its threat do not 
work. Tangible incentives that benefit companies operating in a 
bustling economy succeed more often than not. 
  Affirmative action is obviously needed if South Africa's 
full 
human potential is to be realised. But it cannot be achieved by 
edict. Affirmative action in the business sector has to be 
based on training appropriate, though less-privileged, people in 
the skills needed by individual companies. 
  The main anecdotal drawback for many businessmen is that 
trained people are readily lured away from their jobs by other 
firms whose affirmative action training programmes have been 
inadequate. An easy counter is to compete by paying more. But 
when businesses have to comply with racial employment quotas or 
under the threat of them, the cost of adding to black employee 
numbers is often not of overriding importance. 
  The application of quotas becomes a certain route to 
tokenism. And tokenism is the first step towards endemic 
inefficiency. 
  As a matter of urgency Labour Minister Tito Mboweni must 
establish affirmative action principles or guidelines in 
discussion with industry and labour. Incentives for training 
should be based on appropriate tax breaks even if that gives 
rise to bleats from those who believe corporate South Africa is 
paying too little tax. Incentives cannot be based on government 
hand-outs, but must be designed to take into account the needs 
of the individual firms involved in affirmative action 
programmes. 
  Affirmative action, though, will be of little value if 
closed 
shot arrangements persist. Delivering appropriate training and 
jobs to everyone will call for flexibility from unions to allow 
jobs seekers to bid wages up or down to their appropriate levels.

  [Excerpts] A shell hit Kigali's hospital this morning, 
killing 30 people, according to the United Nations. [passage 
omitted] 
  Yesterday, the United Nations attempted to negotiate with 
the 
government forces and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] to gain 
control of the airport. The United Nations asked for all 
weapons to be withdrawn within a two-kilometer radius of the 
airport. Jacques Bihozagara, one of the RPF officials, gives 
his opinion on this issue. He is interviewed by Adala Benraad: 
  [Begin recording] [Bihozagara] What we are asking is that 
UNAMIR [United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda] should 
remove the Rwandan Government forces, which are firing at us, 
from the airport, so that the airport can be put under its 
control. 
  [Benraad] Is the airport still a military target for you? 
  [Bihozagara] It is not a military target but we say there 
are 
two forces in the airport, UNAMIR and the Rwandan armed forces. 
The Rwandan armed forces are firing at our positions from the 
airport. So you do understand that the airport is not completely 
neutral. 
  [Benraad] So, consequently, after the removal of the 
government forces you would agree to UN convoys being escorted? 
  [Bihozagara] We are not against the principle of escorting 
aid convoys, but we say that the airport is now in a dangerous 
zone and therefore the military should move out so that the 
United Nations can operate freely in complete neutrality. 
  [Benraad] What does the RPF think of the French proposal for 
a regional summit with the participation of Zaire, Uganda, and 
Tanzania to reach a cease-fire? 
  [Bihozagara] This is a proposal from France, which has not 
approached us to ask for our opinion as a party to the conflict, 
but we are ready to examine this proposal. We have no problem 
with the principle of a meeting. [end recording]

  [Text] The genocide continues at a greater pace than ever. 
Putting aside Mr. Theodore Sindikubwabo's pleasure over the 
extermination of Tutsis in Kibuye and Cyangugu, government 
forces recently threatened that they would massacre those 
refugees in the Hotel Des Milles Collines, as well as several 
orphans which were taken hostage by government soldiers and 
Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development militias]. The Interahamwe militiamen and 
government troops are ready to massacre all these people if the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front continues its military advance.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 20 May (AFP) -- Fighting kept up through 
the night into early Friday [20 May] in the Rwandan capital 
Kigali, much of it around the airport where the United Nations 
has stopped flying in any planes, a UN spokesman said. The 
sporadic artillery and mortar exchanges between government 
troops and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) were less 
intense than on Thursday, which saw the heaviest fighting in 
Kigali in 10 days, said Abdul Kabia, spokesman for the UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR). 
  Shells fell throughout the night near Amahoro stadium, where 
several thousand people fleeing the country's ethnic bloodbath 
have sought refuge, though there were no reported injuries, 
Kabia said, contacted by telephone. At least 30 patients, 
wounded survivors of Rwanda's killing fields, died in their beds 
when shells slammed into the crowded Kigali general hospital 
Thursday during violent fighting in several city districts. The 
UN headquarters was also hit though no one was hurt. 
  The United Nations has been trying to broker a ceasefire 
between majority Hutu government forces and the Tutsi 
minority-dominated rebel Front before the planned arrival of the 
new UN troops. UN spokesmen have said they were hoping for a 
response Friday from the government to UN proposals to establish 
a neutral zone at the airport, to allow flights to land without 
hindrance. 
  Despite the battles, the United Nations went ahead with 
plans 
to send in thousands of UN peacekeeping reinforcements. 
  According to Kabia, Ghana confirmed that it would send some 
500 men to boost its battalion of 800 troops already stationed 
in Kigali. Negotiations with other countries to bring in 
equipment needed by the UN peacekeepers are "well advanced," he 
added without giving details. 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali also plans to send 
special envoy Iqbal Riza from the UN peacekeeping operations 
department to Kigali to meet with the belligerents to discuss 
terms of the "new UNAMIR mandate" and try to get their 
"cooperation," Kabia said without specifying any date. [passage

<F P=106> [Commentary by Johan Cuppen: "UNAMIR-II Does Not Solve </F>
Rwandan Problems"] 
  [Text] There is no end in sight to the insanity which has 
held Rwanda in its grip for six weeks now. Estimates of the 
dead or the endless streams of refugees are so immense that they 
exceed human comprehension. Increasingly better informed 
sources talk of half a million dead and a couple million 
refugees, horrifying figures which are rising every day because 
the violence is not stopping and every day brings a new tale of 
terror. 
  Considering this, the UN Security Council resolution 
approved 
Tuesday [17 May] must be met with a cheer. The resolution 
announced an increased UN effort to ease the pain in Rwanda as 
well as an international arms embargo against Rwanda. The 
United Nations wants to increase its troops in Rwanda from the 
current 400 to 5,500 military personnel in the long term. 
  However, there can be no talk of cheering. The resolution is 
unduly late and there is no evidence that it will be implemented 
quickly and smoothly. Meanwhile, the unrest continues, taking 
new victims every day. The fact that the resolution comes so 
late has everything to do with the broad dissension within the 
United Nations and with the cumbersome structure of the 
organization. The dissension has ensured that the resolution is 
just the umpteenth nonbinding statement which the United Nations 
and other international institutions seem to have a patent on. 
  The resolution illustrates the desperation with which the 
international community views the carnage in Rwanda. The troops 
which the United Nations wants to send to Rwanda will have 
little impact on the belligerents because, once again, their 
mandate will be very limited. The Belgian Blue Helmets found 
out what kind of situations such a limited mandate can lead to 
in the first few hours of the violence. The 10 paratroopers 
killed remain a bloody accusation against so much UN laxness. 
The diplomats in New York have obviously not yet learned this 
lesson. 
  The implementation of the resolution has also proved to be 
desperate. It is not only unclear which country will make the 
required troops available for UNAMIR-II [UN Assistance Mission 
in Rwanda] (the reservations shown by a number of countries 
speak volumes), but there is nobody who can say with any 
accuracy when the troops will be on the ground there and where 
they will be deployed. Nor is it clear who will pay the bill. 
In addition, there is the quite clear warning from the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF), which announced that it would treat the 
UN Blue Helmets as the enemy if they do not stick strictly to 
their humanitarian mandate. That does not bode well. The RPF 
attitude raises ever more questions. The military successes 
which the RPF has had on the ground have made its leaders so 
drunk with victory that the question arises as to whether the 
RPF is still negotiating in good faith on the basis of or in the 
spirit of the peace agreement reached last year in Arusha with 
the then government in Kigali. 
  Belgian diplomacy still believes in the Arusha agreement, or 
at least in "the spirit of Arusha." That is apparent in the 
answers given by Foreign Minister Willy Claes yesterday [18 May] 
in the Senate in reply to questions put to him. How this 
"spirit" is supposed to be interpreted in the light of the 
latest developments is no longer clear. For this reason, it is 
wise to send Ambassador Johan Swinnen [ambassador in Rwanda] to 
the countries neighboring Rwanda in order to assess the new 
situation. However, just as important is to bring on board 
other countries which in the past played a major role in Rwanda, 
especially France, which is charting a bizarre course of its own.

  [Text] Sao Tome, 19 May (AFP) -- Sao Tomean Prime Minister 
Norberto Costa Alegre's party, the Democratic Convergence Party 
[PCD], has accused President Miguel Trovoada of setting 
"conditions which might bring down the government, as was the 
case in May 1992, when former Prime Minister Daniel Daio was 
dismissed," the party newspaper reported in Sao Tome today. 
  These accusations come amidst tension between President 
Trovoada and the government, following attacks published by the 
government newspaper, NOTICIAS, against the president. The 
newspaper is run by a PCD parliamentarian, Martihno Tavares. 
  According to a source at the presidency, President Trovoada 
asked the premier to intervene to put an end to the attacks. 
The newspaper further accused President Trovoada of "not 
respecting the agreement reached between himself and the PCD 
during the 1991 democratic transitional period." The newspaper 
did not state what that agreement was. 
  President Trovoada was elected at the beginning of 1992 
during the country's first multiparty presidential elections, in 
which he stood as an independent candidate. The government was 
formed following the country's first multiparty parliamentary 
elections, which the PCD won. 
  President Trovoada dismissed Premier Daniel Daio in April 
1992 following a sociopolitical crisis linked with the adoption 
of austerity measures, an increase in the price of petroleum 
products, and the 40-percent devaluation of their currency, the 
dobra. Finance Minister Costa Alegre then took over as prime 
minister.

  [Excerpts] Mohamed Farah Aidid, USC chairman and leader of 
the Somali National Alliance [SNA], and USC chairman and his 
large delegation have returned to Mogadishu after visiting a 
number of African and Arab countries and participating in the 
Nairobi conference of Somali leaders. Addressing thousands of 
people who gathered to welcome him at the 1 July Independence 
Square, Mohamed Farah Aidid spoke about his visit to Djibouti 
and Uganda where he attended the Pan-African Movement Congress 
conference. [passage omitted] 
  He said although a few people believe that a government 
cannot be formed in the country that is not the case. On the 
week-long meeting in Addis Ababa between the SNA and the Somali 
National Movement [SNM] and the movement's stand on the Somali 
people's unity, Mr. Aidid said the SNA supports the SNM stand as 
this is a remedy for the Somali people's unity and will serve 
the aspirations of the people living in the northwestern 
regions. He appealed for this constructive step to be welcomed. 
  The SNA leader also spoke about the failed preparatory 
conference which was scheduled to be held in Mogadishu and 
which, he said, was caused by meetings of the Somali Salvation 
Democratic Front and the Somali Patriotic Movement, and because 
of the situation in Kismaayo. The SNA has never requested a 
postponement of the conference, but only supported the 
postponement requests from other quarters. He said that Somali 
organizations, including the SNM, would meet in Mogadishu on 30 
May to discuss the government structure to be formed, taking 
into account each organization's influence. 
  He appealed to those involved in preparing the conference to 
assist in specific areas, and to try not to interfere in the 
areas they have not been assigned to. Mr. Aidid called on the 
Somali people to guard against those who make it a habit to 
serve foreigners, until a government is formed. He referred to 
the importance of peace, the peace agreements in the central and 
northwestern regions, and the Kah Hotel agreement. He wished 
the outgoing peace conference in Kismaayo success. 
  Aidid demonstrated how self-seekers serving foreigners are 
responsible for setting the brotherly SNA people against each 
other. [passage omitted] Mr. Aidid called for the protection of 
foreigners in Somalia. Speaking on his own behalf and on that 
of the SNA, Mr. Aidid congratulated the Somali people and the 
world Muslim community on the occasion of 'Id al-Adha.

  [Text] The government has called on the international 
community to initiate a comprehensive program to deal with the 
increasing influx of refugees in the Kagera and Kigoma regions. 
This program would involve the refugees themselves, as well as 
the regions inhabitants. This call was made today by the deputy 
prime minister and minister for home affairs, the Honorable 
Augustine Mrema, while he was receiving a donation of 12 
vehicles from the Russian Government. These vehicles will be 
used in helping refugees in the Kagera and Kigoma regions. 
  Mrema stressed that the problem of refugees in these regions 
is gigantic, and that it required a proper strategy and program 
to handle it. Mrema thanked the Russian Government for its 
assistance, and also thanked other countries which had extended 
various kinds of help for the refugees, most of whom are 
Rwandans running away from the civil war raging in their 
country. Twenty other vehicles, donated by the Russian 
Government, are due in the country during the middle of next 
month. The ceremony was also attended by Russian Ambassador 
(Klimatov).

  [Excerpts] The official opening of the Constituent Assembly 
[CA] has been held at the Uganda International Conference Center 
with a keynote address by President Yoweri Museveni to the 
delegates. [passage omitted]. 
  In his address to the CA, President Museveni called upon the 
delegates to facilitate the making of the constitution that will 
mainly create a modern industrialized society so that the people 
of Uganda are able to emancipate themselves from manual labor 
and protect their sovereignty. He also urged them to evolve a 
constitution that can quickly galvanize a Uganda people into a 
cohesive force. He said the constitution they are going to do 
shall be able to ensure unity in diversity with a clear vision 
and emphasis on integration and modernization. [passage omitted]. 
  He told the delegates that they should create conditions for 
the modernization and industrialization of Africa with a wide 
spectrum of raw materials, a large skilled labor force, and a 
large internal market, all essential for feasible integration. 
  He impressed upon the delegates the need to ensure a healthy 
and not [word indistinct] Uganda. He urged them to design a 
constitution that puts in place maximum freedom for the direct 
producers of wealth whom he categorized as farmers, industrial 
workers and industrialists, artisans, and the people working in 
the services sector. He said these direct producers of wealth 
should have minimum inconvenience from governments and 
bureaucrats, and the entrepreneurial class must be left to 
evolve freely, so that the middle class will be a stabilizing 
force and integrative elements for our society are formed. 
  Mr. Museveni further urged the delegates to avoid the 
temptation to transplant management models from elsewhere, 
declaring that political institutions cannot exist in the air 
without a social basis. He therefore noted that Uganda must 
ensure that our political institutions spring from our social 
structure on a healthy basis. The president reminded the 
delegates that what has happened today is the fulfillment of 
what the NRM [National Resistance Movement] envisaged, promised, 
and set out to do way back in 1981.

  [Text] Mrs. Musuleng-Cooper is to be inducted today as 
foreign minister. Mrs. Cooper was yesterday confirmed by the 
Transitional Legislative Assembly following confirmation 
hearings at the Capitol. 
  Speaking during the hearing, Mrs. Cooper expressed her 
desire 
to work closely with all friendly nations for the speedy 
restoration of general peace to this country. She said a lot is 
required from the outside world for the furtherance of peace and 
reconciliation. She stressed the need for proper coordination 
and consultation between the transitional government and the

  Mrs. Cooper pledged not to disrupt the existing operations

  [Text] Problems slowing down the implementation of the 
Cotonou peace agreement for Liberia have been the key elements 
of lengthy discussions between the former NPRA [National 
Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly] government's President 
Charles Gankay Taylor and UN's special representative to 
Liberia, Mr. Trevor Gordon-Somers. The meeting is believed to 
have centered on removing obstacles in the way of the peace 
process. Inside sources said one of the highlights of the 
meeting was the slow pace of the deployment of the expanded 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group] throughout Liberia which is a prerequisite to 
the disarmament exercise of all fighting groups in the country. 
This has been the hurdle in carrying out the military aspect of 
the Cotonou accord.

  [Text] Alhaji Koromah has reportedly been holding evening 
meetings with the Guinean and Sierra Leonean ambassadors at 
Hotel Africa. The nature of Koromah's secret meetings with the 
two West African diplomats is not known, but sources close to 
the Sierra Leonean Embasssy in Monrovia say Koromah is 
soliciting support to continue his fighting against Roosevelt 
Johnson's Krahn faction in ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for

  [Text] This week, the Malian Government and Tuareg rebels 
from the Azaouad Movement have signed an agreement in Algiers. 
Under the terms of the agreement, the former Tuareg rebels will 
be integrated into the Malian Army and civil service. But 
today, two different organizations who have an interest have 
given their reaction to the agreement, one is (Ganda Koi), an 
organization representing Africans who have had their own 
problems with Tuaregs in northern Mali. The other is the Malian 
Trade Union Movement, and it seems that neither of them are 
happy. From Bamako, Moussa Fofana telexed this report: 
  In an appeal published in a daily newspaper today, the 
(Ganda 
Koi) movement urged Malians to fight against the Tuareg rebels. 
It said that the country was in danger, and said it would fight 
until the eradication of rapists, murderers, and looters -- who 
are known as rebels. The movement, however, said that it would 
not attack the Malian Army, peaceful civilians, and foreigners. 
(Ganda Koi) is a movement composed of members of the black 
ethnic group Songhai, who live in the north of the country in 
the Tuareg areas. The words (Ganda Koi) mean: masters of the 
land. 
  Meanwhile today, the powerful grouping of Malian trade 
unions, the UNTM, issued a communique reacting to the 
government's decision to integrate Tuaregs into the Army and 
civil service. The unions say that ethnicity should not be the 
basis for employment in the civil service. The secretary 
general of the UNTM, Mr. (Issa Doukoure), told me that the trade 
unions could use strike action and other forms of civil 
disobedience in order to force the government to back down. He 
said that the unions would never accept the allocation of civil 
service positions to people who did not possess the necessary 
skills to carry out their jobs properly.

  [Text] Niamey, May 19 (AFP) -- Fifteen Tuareg rebels were 
killed and five government troops wounded when an Army patrol 
clashed with rebels trying to steal an official vehicle, 
Interior Minister Ousmane Oumarou told AFP Thursday [19 May]. 
  Five rebels were detained after the incident, which happened 
Monday between Assode and Timia, in the Iferouane region. 
  Troops seized a four-wheel drive vehicle, weapons, 
ammunition 
and various documents of the Front for the Liberation of the Air 
and Azawagh (FLAA), one of four Tuareg rebel movements in Niger. 
  The clash came after the government and the rebels last week 
said they would seek a negotiated end to the three-year conflict 
which has claimed more than 100 lives. 
  Officials from mediating countries -- Algeria, Burkina Faso 
and France -- met with delegates from the two sides last week 
and said the government and the rebels agreed in principle to a 
meeting soon. 
  Both sides last met in Ouagadougou in February.

  [Text] Lagos, 19 May (AFP) -- Some members of the Campaign 
for Democracy (CD), an umbrella group of about 40 pro-democracy 
and human rights organizations, today in Lagos threatened to 
"physically disrupt" the election on 23 May of ward delegates to 
the constitutional conference. 
  The conference, which is expected to start on 27 June, is a 
priority for the regime, which seized power in November, 1993. 
The conference is expected to discuss national problems and 
threats to the country's unity. 
  A statement signed by Olaitan Oyerinde, chairman of the 
Lagos 
State branch of the CD, said that its members will not allow 
elections to be held in the state on 23 May, a day which has 
been declared a public holiday by the government in order to 
ensure that voters turn out to participate in the exercise. 
  The statement called on polling agents, generally recruited 
from among teachers and civil servants, not to show up at the 
polling stations on 23 May. The CD, which described the 
constitutional conference as a "trick," expressed support for 
the call made on 16 May by the National Democratic Coalition 
(NADECO), for General Sani Abacha to leave office before 31 May, 
and for the holding of a "sovereign national conference." 
NADECO is a new prodemocracy organization, which was formed on 
13 May.

  [Text] Elections to select delegates to Nigeria's national 
constitutional conference start on Monday [23 May], and in the 
run-up, state security forces have been moving against the newly 
formed National Democratic Coalition, which has been calling on 
Nigerians to boycott everything to do with the constitutional 
conference. The boycott call has met with some success in the 
Yoruba parts of western Nigeria. Today, Yoruba traditional 
chieftains and leaders who backed the boycott tried to hold a 
meeting, but they ran into problems. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa 
reports: 
  [Begin Odunfa recording] Fully armed policemen were brought 
out this morning to prevent a meeting of traditional rulers and 
political leaders of the Yoruba-speaking people in western 
Nigeria from being held. The meeting was to be held at the 
palace of the Awujale of Ijebuland, to take a final decision on 
whether the Yoruba people should participate in the forthcoming 
national constitutional conference. The Yoruba are one of the 
three major ethnic groups in Nigeria. Armed policemen, led by 
an area commander, were at the (Djebodi Palace) gate several 
hours before the guests started arriving, at about 11 o'clock. 
They turned each guest back politely at the gate, saying that 
they had instructions from above to abort the meeting. Those 
refused entry into the palace included the former civilian 
governor of the state, Chief Segun Oshoba, and his deputy, and 
senators in the last democratic regime. 
  The traditional ruler of Ondo, Oba Festus Adesunye, was 
stopped at the police checkpoint on the highway leading into the 
town and was told politely not to go to the palace -- he 
complied. Other traditional rulers who had had wind of the 
police action stayed away. Journalists who had converged at the 
palace gate were also refused entry. After being turned back, 
Chief Segun Oshoba told journalists that, whether the meeting 
was held or not, the boycott of the constitutional conference 
election in Ogun State would be total. 
  At their meeting in Owo yesterday, the major Yoruba 
political 
leaders declared their total support for the boycott of the 
constitutional conference, as demanded by the National 
Democratic Coalition. The politicians said that the conference, 
not being of sovereign status, could not achieve any success in

  [Text] A group which includes a number of trade unionists 
has asked Nigerians not to do anything that would disrupt the 
Constitutional Conference election, scheduled for Monday [23 
May]. In a two-page statement, the group, which includes: 
Comrades Yomi Olusanya, Adetola Oseni, Chief Dayo Abata, Mrs. 
M.I. Akpankpa, Dr. David Ogunsede, and Chief Tayo Soyode, said 
it would be strategically unwise and politically suicidal for 
any ethnic group to boycott the proposed national constitutional 
conference. 
  The group recalled the experience of the nation in calling 
for a similar boycott order, by those it described as 
progressives in the 1964 federal elections, and declared that it 
would be wiser to use the constitutional conference platform to 
build a genuine national consensus for a fresh re-examination of 
the aborted democratic march, than to boycott it. According to 
the group, a boycott of the conference will turn the gathering 
into a conspiracy theater, and will not be in the long-term 
interest of any ethnic group.

  [Text] The Anambra State police command has discovered an 
illegal arms factory at Ntede in Oyi local government area of 
the state. Correspondent Eddy Okafor reports that the 
proprietor of the factory was arrested following information 
given by two armed robbery suspects: 
  [Begin Okafor recording] Arraigning the illegal arms 
manufacturer in Government House, Oka, the state police 
commissioner, Alhaji Mamman Ankah, said two shotguns, one 
locally made pistol, and 12 live cartridges were recovered from 
the factory. Speaking while inspecting the arms and ammunition, 
the state administrator, Kuman Nakata, said he is not opposed to 
possession of arms for security purposes, provided such 
possession is within the provisions of the law. He directed the 
police to carry out thorough investigations with a view to 
detecting similar factories elsewhere. 
  Earlier, the arrested arms manufacturer said he got his 
license to manufacture arms from colonial masters in 1952, 
adding that most of the guns recovered belong to vigilante 
groups from neighboring towns. Meanwhile, the two teenage 
robbery suspects who gave the tipoff after the arrest [words 
indistinct] confessed robbing a man of the sum of 1,500 naira. 
The state commissioner of police, Alhaji Mamman, told NTA News 
of the determination of his command to rid the state of 
criminals. He said the suspects would soon appear in court.

<F P=106> [From the "Last Minute" program] </F>
  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] has requested the international community to 
exercise pressure on the government led by the Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola in Luanda to end what it described 
as the massacre of civilians and the use of chemical weapons in 
Angola. A communique issued by Jonas Malheiro Savimbi's 
movement in Brussels has accused the government armed forces of 
using chemical weapons and South African mercenaries against the 
Angolan people and called on the United Nations, the European 
Union, the OAU, and South African President Nelson Mandela to 
intervene. This afternoon, Goncalves Carvalho contacted UNITA 
representative in Brussels Alcides Sakala to give more details 
on the communique. 
  [Begin recording] [Sakala] We think the situation has 
deteriorated of late, following the systematic use of chemical 
weapons in air raids carried out by the Angolan Government 
against defenseless people in major urban centers, particularly 
in Ndalatando, Huambo, and other cities. That is why, we 
decided to alert the international community to this serious 
situation in Angola. 
  [Goncalves] Is there any proof of the use of chemical 
weapons 
and acts of genocide. 
  [Sakala] There is a lot. We have sufficient evidence that we 
shall present to the international community in due time. This 
behavior by the Angolan Government is not new. As you are 
aware, during the war fomented by Russians and Cubans in Angola, 
the Angolan Government systematically used these chemical 
weapons. It is now doing so again and in a massive way. 
  [Goncalves] The government has at times made similar 
accusations against UNITA. 
  [Sakala] We have no aircraft, as you are very much aware. 
The accusations are therefore not valid. 
  [Goncalves] Well, but chemical weapons can also be used by 
artillery. 
  [Sakala] UNITA does not use chemical weapons in its 
operations. We do not use chemical weapons, but we have clear 
evidence that the government has been systematically using them. 
  [Goncalves] When will UNITA present this evidence? 
  [Sakala] Soon, soon. As you are aware, Mr. Hendricks, a very 
experienced specialist is presently here in Brussels. He has 
visited our areas on various occasions, and he was the one who 
for the first time informed the world about the use of these 
weapons by the government. We are in contact with him here in 
Brussels, and we shall see how we can in due time expose this 
violation. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] N'Dalatando is facing a critical situation. The 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] is bent on 
decimating the residents of N'Dalatando, using its air force and 
long-range artillery pieces. 
  About 28 air raids were carried out on 18 May. The MPLA used 
TC- 7's, MiG-23's, and Su's. More than 70 bombs with substances 
banned internationally were being dropped on the city and 
outlaying areas daily. [passage omitted] 
  A terrible MPLA military offensive is under way in Cuanza 
Sul. The four-pronged offensive was launched from Waku-Kungo and 
Gabela and is designed to capture the District of Ebo. The 
offensive, which began on 16 May 1994, has been characterized by 
massive air force attacks and artillery shelling. Violent 
clashes have been taking place with the UNITA [National Union 
for the Total Independence of Angola] armed forces defending the 
people from the MPLA adventure. People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] units have been left to their own 
devices. A number of FAPLA members have surrendered to UNITA. 
Cadet Officer Daniel Caieba, a native of (Cassongue), 
surrendered to UNITA on 17 May. [passage omitted] 
  The communist regime of Jose Eduardo dos Santos is bent on 
resuming war in the city of Bie. Lethal equipment for MPLA 
troops was unloaded in Bie at approximately 0625 on 18 May. 
Flying from Luanda, a IL-776 military aircraft dropped eight 
parachutes, but all of them fell in the sector of the city 
controlled by UNITA. Five parachutes had grenades, large 
quantities of AK-47's, AGS 17 ammunition belts, and AK-47 
ammunition boxes. The other three parachutes had Racal-30 
communications radios. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The capital of Cuanza Norte Province has been 
liberated. The Republic of Angola's flag was once again raised 
in N'Dalatando today. Izidro Sanhanga reports: 
  I have striven to get the confirmation. After all, it is 
true. N'Dalatando has been liberated and that is why the people 
sing. [crowd sings Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola 
slogans and informal musicians play peace song] The people sing 
peace and freedom. It looks as if freedom reins. Actually the 
Republic of Angola's flag has been raised once again. 
  This is now a free land where state administration has been 
reinstated. There is a great deal more to report about these 
long months of UNITA's [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] military occupation. Cameraman 
Boaventura Canjanja has shot whatever he could. So, Cuanza 
Norte will be in focus in the next news bulletins.

UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
areas in Uige and Negage. Citing a military source in Luanda, 
the Portuguese news agency LUSA says the bombings are being

The source said the bombings are designed to prevent UNITA from 
moving reinforcements from Uige Province to retake N'Dalatando, 
which was captured by government forces early this month.

  [Text] There were no talks in Lusaka today. The UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
negotiating team this morning informed its government 
counterpart that it was not able to take part in the talks 
because the UNITA leader had not given the green light to the 
issues raised by the UNITA negotiators about Vorgan [Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel]. The government accepted the 
UNITA negotiators' request for an adjournment because that is 
the prerogative of the two teams. There are decisions that the 
two negotiating teams cannot make without consulting their 
leaders. 
  Today the two delegations held separate meetings. A 
well-placed UNITA source said in Lusaka today that the issues 
raised with Jonas Savimbi are not only linked to Vorgan, but 
also to the government's reaction to UNITA's participation at 
various levels of government. UNITA says the (?government's 
reaction) has been negative. There is nothing scheduled for 
tomorrow. It all depends on UNITA. Meanwhile, the government 
continues to wait patiently.

  [Text] A study of the viability of the government's 
economic program being carried out by an IMF technical mission 
has concluded with strong indications of satisfaction, according 
to head of the mission Sergio Leite, who was speaking in a news 
conference today. Despite this positive observation, however, 
Sergio Leite stressed the need to give priority to finer details 
of the implementation. 
  [Begin Leite recording] I believe that if such economic 
measures are implemented correctly, there will be a considerable 
economic growth in Angola in the next few years. It is 
possible, and it will happen if you continue implementing 
coherent economic measures. [end recording] 
  There is still room for doubt, however, since many steps 
need 
to be taken to ensure success. Leite noted, however, that 
Angola has considerable possibilities and resources for 
adjusting its economy. 
  [Begin Leite recording] The armed conflict is obviously the 
major obstacle to the economic development, but even within 
these conditions, there is the need to oversee the adjustment. 
Although many people are afraid of the economic adjustment, 
this happened extensively in Angola in 1993 and was successful. 
[end recording] 
  Severino de Morais, deputy planning and economic 
coordination minister, said the new economic government team 
intends to once again accomplish that goal and added that the 
preliminary draft resulting from the work of the two technical 
teams satisfies the intentions of both sides. Despite delays in 
implementing particularly the foreign exchange policy, the 
Angolan and international experts believe that it is still too 
early to evaluate the situation. At the end of the meeting the 
two teams bid farewell to each other. One is leaving for 
Washington to present its report to the director's fund 
committee, and the other remains here to fight for the 
development of the Angolan economy.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] In its veiled efforts to destroy democracy in 
Angola, the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] 
government is seeking to silence the only voice opposed to the 
regime -- Vorgan [Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel] -- 
and then use its disinformation apparatus to bamboozle the 
Angolan and international opinion at will. How many times have 
the Angolan and world opinion not been deceived by the news 
media in the service of the MPLA government? How many times has 
that news media not insulted those Angolans who do not subscribe 
to the ideology of the ruling party? How many blatant 
falsehoods carried by the Angola National Radio and the People's 
Television of Angola have to be corrected by Vorgan? 
  Vorgan is here to tell the truth to the Angolan people. 
Vorgan is here to inform the Angolan and international opinion 
about the program of action of the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] that the MPLA government wants to 
silence. Vorgan is here to expose the historic crimes that men 
in the service of Eduardo dos Santos commit daily against 
Angolans. Vorgan can be received on your radios to 
counterattack the dirty and slanderous propaganda disseminated 
by the news media in the service of the totalitarian and 
insensitive ruling party -- the MPLA. Vorgan is here to protect 
the Angolan people and to challenge the rumors spread daily by 
Eduardo dos Santos' gang who would like to see supporters of 
UNITA and its leaders on the run. 
  Vorgan is here also to back other voices opposed to Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos' totalitarian regime. Vorgan has for many 
years now been the conduit of God's message to all Angolan 
Christians. Vorgan is the link uniting all Angolans who want a 
united and single Angola which is equal for all, in a real and 
genuine democracy free of hatred, treason, and division. 
  Vorgan is the free voice of free Angolans. Only detractors 
of democracy and dictators like the MPLA government leaders are 
interested in silencing UNITA's radio station -- the Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel -- in order to serve their 
Machiavellian interests. 
  Forward with a free press! Long live peace, freedom, and 
democracy! Long live our president, Dr. Savimbi!

  [Text] The Right Honorable the Prime Minister Dr. Ntsu 
Mokhehle this morning held talks with leaders of all political 
parties in the country on the current instability caused by the 
strike action by members of the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police and 
the prisons service over salaries. 
  In his brief to the political leaders the prime minister 
outlined the grievances that led to the police strike and that 
several meetings were held between government representatives 
and an eight-man police delegation to review the grievances by 
the police. He said of the eight grievances presented to the 
government he told the police delegation that seven were already 
being addressed. The prime minister said he was disturbed that 
the day after the police had started the strike action some of 
them [words indistinct] and looted shops in Maseru, Mafeteng, 
Leribe, and other main centers in the country. 
  Dr. Mokhehle said he called a meeting of the Defense 
Commission to discuss the problems arising out of the strike. 
He also met a delegation of the striking police, together with 
the honorable minister of foreign affairs and home affairs. The 
prime minister told the political leaders that after lengthy 
consultations with the police delegation he told them that the 
government could not afford to pay them the 60 percent salary 
increase they demanded. He said all civil servants were due to 
receive a 10 percent salary increase with effect from 1 April 
this year, and that any salary increase affected all sections of 
the civil service alike. In addition, the economy of Lesotho 
was such that the level of salary increase demanded by the 
police was not affordable. 
  Dr. Mokhehle said there appeared to be an understanding 
between the government and the police delegation at the end of 
the four days of talks. The government acceded to the police 
assurance that they would not be victimized if they returned to 
work. The prime minister said notwithstanding the agreement 
reached between the government and the police, they decided to 
continue with the strike and called a press conference in which 
they declared that they would not continue work until their 
demands were met. Dr. Mokhehle said some political parties in 
the country, including the Basotho National Party, BNP, were 
involved in fanning trouble over salary dispute. 
  He called on all the parties to declare that they were not 
involved and welcomed the statement of Marematlou Freedom Party 
saying that they were not involved. The leader of the BNP, 
Retsilisitsoe Sekhonyana, expressed disappointment over the 
prime minister's allegation of BNP involvement in fanning 
trouble in the police strike. Retsilisitsoe Sekhonyana said he 
respected the prime minister and was concerned that there were 
some people who supplied him with misinformation. 
  After his remarks the BNP leader walked out of the meeting 
together with some members of his party.

  [Text] The political crisis in Lesotho has deepened after a 
meeting of leaders failed to end the police and prison guards' 
strike. Reports say the main opposition party walked out of the 
emergency talks after being accused by Prime Minister Ntsu 
Mokhehle of complicity in the strike. About 2,500 policemen 
below the rank of captain in the country's 3,000-strong police 
force started striking last week demanding a 60 percent pay 
increase. They were joined by junior prison guards.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The man most likely to succeed Dr. Banda, as the 
current pattern of results continues, is the UDF [United 
Democratic Front] candidate Bakili Muluzi. On the line to 
Blantyre last night, I asked Mr. Muluzi whether he now expected 
to be Malawi's next president. 
  [Begin recording] [Muluzi] Well, I think so, from the look 
of 
the things. From the results that have already been counted, 
definitely yes. For your information, I had already a call from 
the vice president of the Malawi Congress Party [MCP] conveying 
congratulations from Dr. Banda and conceding defeat. 
  [Unidentified reporter] And what about in the parliamentary 
results. Do you also expect to hold a majority in parliament? 
  [Muluzi] Well, yes, we might just make it. You know that we 
actually have got most of the seats in the southern region and 
some seats in the central region; and definitely we might just 
make it for majority in parliament. 
  [Reporter] With things still not quite over yet, there is 
still a way to go. If it does emerge that you don't quite have 
enough of a majority in parliament, is it possible you would 
consider a coalition, and if so, who do you think that is likely 
to be with? 
  [Muluzi] Well, we haven't given a thought to that one, but 
if 
that comes to that kind of thing, we wouldn't mind talking to 
the other opposition parties. In this case, we are talking 
about Aford [Alliance for Democracy]. I have not had any word 
with our good friend, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, but if it comws to 
that, we will definitely be talking to them. After all, we 
fought this campaign, particularly the referendum, together. 
So, we definitely, would not mind talking to them at all. 
  [Reporter] So, in other words, would you rule out altogether 
any kind of a deal with MCP? 
  [Muluzi] Well, yes. Mind you, although it wasn't a fight as 
such, but I think we are fighting a system and that system was 
the Malawi Congress Party system. We definitely have not even 
thought about talking to Malawi Congress Party at all. The 
opposition that is leading at the moment, apart from the UDF, is 
Aford, and perhaps one would be more comfortable talking to 
Aford than MCP. 
  [Reporter] So, Mr. Muluzi, has your success in this election 
come as something of a surprise to you or not? 
  [Muluzi] I wouldn't say as a surprise. I think our party has 
been very popular. From the beginning, it was one of those 
parties which was well organized, and we had support in a quite 
a number of areas in our country. So, yes, a surprise, but not 
a lot of surprise. I think we definitely expected some kind of 
change. Let me just mention again that, I think, the mood in 
Malawi has been for change. I think people have been looking 
for a change for a long time. I think it is just time that 
people wanted change. 
  [Reporter] So, finally at this time, do you have any message 
for the man who is still, after all, the incumbent president in 
Malawi, President Banda? 
  [Muluzi] Well, let me just mention one thing to you -- that 
we definitely recognize the role that Dr. Banda played, you 
know, during the time he has been president. I mean, he has 
been president of Malawi for the last 30 years. Definitely, one 
perhaps would say, look, let him retire in peace. I personally 
had nothing personal to Dr. Banda [sentence as heard]. I think 
we are fighting his system of government. So, what I would like 
to say is that, you know, let him have a peaceful retirement. I 
would definitely want to thank him for whatever contribution he 
made to Malawi. I think it is just human to say that. [end

  [Text] The president-elect of Malawi, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, 
has pledged an open government and a close working relationship 
with opposition parties. Addressing a media conference in 
Blantyre, he said he held no grudge against the previous 
government of Dr. Kamuzu Banda, and that he did not believe in 
starting a witch-hunt against its members. 
  Mr. Muluzi said he would have no problem in seeking an 
alliance with Mr. Chakufwa Chihana's Alliance for Democracy in 
the event of his party not gaining an outright majority. The 
final results of the elections are expected later today. 
  On relations with South Africa, Mr. Muluzi said he would 
seek 
close cooperation and pointed out that a formal trade agreement 
existed between the two countries. He said the alleviation of 
poverty in Malawi and environmental affairs would receive 
priority. His inauguration as president will take place in 
Blantyre on Saturday.

  [Text] Malawi's president-elect, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, has 
said he will have no problems in forming a coalition government 
with the Alliance for Democracy, Aford, if his party, the United 
Democratic Front, UDF, failed to win a majority in number of 
seats in Parliament. Addressing a press conference in Blantyre 
today, Mr, Muluzi ruled out the possibility of forming an 
alliance with the Malawi Congress Party [MCP] if his party 
failed to (?form) a majority in Parliament. But Mr. Muluzi 
disclosed that his government will look after the outgoing 
president, Dr. Kamuzu Banda. 
  On his government's policy on the economy, Mr. Muluzi said 
his priority will be to alleviate poverty. He said his 
government will attempt to improve social services, reduce the 
high infant mortality rate, and improve the education sector to 
reduce the illiteracy rate (?in the country). Mr. Muluzi also 
said that the UDF government would put emphasis on the 
enforcement of the rule of law. Mr. Muluzi will be sworn in as 
president on Saturday on May the 21st. 
  In his victory speech addressed to UDF supporters at the UDF 
national headquarters, Mr. Muluzi said all Malawians are winners 
because they have made it possible for this country to 
experience political transition [words indistinct] the only way 
of (?building) reconciliation and democracy is in Malawi to 
stay. [words indistinct] the UDF government was not a government 
of [words indistinct]. At this point, Mr. Muluzi called on the 
people to join hands [words indistinct] regardless of political

  [Text] His Excellency the president, ngwazi [paramount 
chief] Dr. Kamuzu Banda, has conceded defeat in the country's 
first multiparty elections held on Tuesday. In a broadcast to 
the nation today, the president said although the results of the 
election have not been officially confirmed [words indistinct] 
every indication was that Mr. Bakili Muluzi was the clear winner 
in the contest for the Presidency of this country. He 
congratulated Mr. Muluzi and offered him his full support and 
cooperation as he takes over the presidency (?of the country). 
The ngwazi said as one of the incoming opposition parties, the 
Malawi Congress Party [MCP] will work with the United Democratic 
Party [UDP] government for building a better, democratic Malawi. 
  In his speech the president thanked all Malawians for having 
allowed him to be their leader for the past 31 years [words 
indistinct] upholding the four cornerstones of the MCP -- 
namely, unity, loyalty, experience, and (?discipline). He said 
the four cornerstones [words indistinct] for the long standing 
political stability and for the continuing social and economic 
development in this country. 
  The ngwazi also pointed out that the peaceful transition 
into 
multiparty democracy the country has undergone since last year 
has won Malawians respect. At this point, the president advised 
that despite the vigorous campaign during which many unkind 
things were told at [words indistinct] the political parties in 
this country should remain friends and not enemies. He urged 
all Malawians to bury their political differences and to work 
together for a united and prosperous new Malawi. The ngwazi 
then appealed to MCP supporters and those of other losing 
parties to accept their defeat honorably and [words indistinct] 
and advised members of the victorious United Democratic Party, 
UDF, to celebrate their victory with [words indistinct] and 
understanding and not with (?vengeance).

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Aford Secretary General Dr. (Musi </F>
Mtewa) by Dan Issacs on 18 May, place not given; from the 
"Network Africa" program--recorded] 
  [Text] As predicted, the other main opposition grouping, 
Aford [Alliance for Democracy], headed by Chakufwa Chihana, has 
gained solid support in the north of the country, but that is 
seemingly not enough to seriously challenge the current front 
runner, the UDF [United Democratic Front]. On the line to 
Malawi, I asked Aford Secretary General Dr. (Musi Mtewa) whether 
he was disappointed with the results so far. 
  [(Mtewa)] No, we are satisfied with the results, as expected 
in the north. We did expect on the basis of our strategy to 
make sure that the north was an absolute Aford stronghold. We 
did expect a favorable comfortable seat in the center region. 
Now, there was, as a result of the pick-ups we have made, that 
you can says does fall short of our expectations in the center. 
We had a high estimation of seats in the south, in those places 
where we did do quite a successful campaign, but our margins of 
gain in those were comfortable, but not strong enough to cause 
an upset of the UDF [words indistinct]. 
  [Isaacs] Do you regret the fact that the opposition in 
Malawi 
is divided along these regional lines, where obviously you could 
have presented a more of a united front and come out ahead very 
more on top than you have done? 
  [(Mtewa)] It is pure coincidental that the parties do follow 
the original homes of the current leaders. My president, 
Chakufwa Chihana, from [word indistinct] and therefore the 
north, Bakili Muluzi is birth place Machinga in the South, and 
Kamuzu Banda's location in the Center, Kasungu. Pure 
coincidental. 
  [Isaacs] Now, having actually broken away from the UDF to 
fight the election, would you now, in light of what has happened 
in the results, would you consider joining up forces again, in 
some kind of a coalition, if you were asked? 
  [(Mtewa)] First, the assumption probably would be that at 
least we were united at one time. Historically, we were united 
in the fight, of course, for the multiparty referendum. You are 
correct, but since the referendum last year, June, of course, 
the need was for the singular parties to have a separate 
identity and to fight the elections and [words indistinct] as a 
party plurality of the organizations quite independent of each 
other. That has happened and the result of this election is to 
maintain that plurality and we have advanced the view that, of 
course, cooperation in other means and other measures of 
national policy are all right. 
  Now, in the interest of forming a government of national 
unity as the result of the elections probably do foretell, that 
is something that we, as Aford, would be interested in 
considering and sitting down, of course, with any one of the 
parties to define [words indistinct] and to be able to say that 
whatever is the outcome [words indistinct] advance the agenda 
for democracy, as people in this country did fight for.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The man often assumed to be the power behind the 
throne in Malawi is Minister of State in the Presidency's Office 
John Tembo. On the line last night, I asked him whether him 
whether the MCP [Malawi Congress Party] had yet conceded defeat. 
  [Begin recording] [Tembo] Actually, depending on the figures 
which were coming in yesterday, UDF [United Democratic Front] 
were ahead in polling. The figures were in their favor; but 
naturally the final figures were not out yet. We should be 
getting them sometime this morning or late afternoon today. Our 
reaction to it is that there is a normal electoral process and 
we accept the victory of the UDF or any other party which wins 
in this election. It is part of a system which we set in motion 
to do. 
  [Unidentified reporter] But surely, if this trend does 
continue and the UDF indeed win, it must come as rather a bitter 
blow to you that the MCP has suffered such a heavy defeat? 
  [Tembo] Well, naturally any party which loses, it feels sad, 
but if you accept, in a multiparty system, a democratic process 
and the right for people to choose a party of their choice, you 
must also accept that you can lose or win and the Malawi 
Congress will accept. 
  [Reporter] So, why do you think the results have been so bad 
in fact? 
  [Tembo] Well, I don't consider them that bad. I mean, 
considering the fact that the Malawi Congress Party has been in 
power for the last 30 years. It is natural that people in the 
transition we are going through, not only in Malawi but 
elsewhere, have the right to choose the party they want to 
govern them at that time. So, it is not really a shock or that 
bad. 
  [Reporter] Overall, have you been happy with the conduct of 
the election, that it has indeed been a peaceful and free and 
fair vote? 
  [Tembo] Yes, so far as the process is concerned, it has been 
very free and very fair. There has been no problem. No report 
of any intimidation. There is no report of any problem at any 
station. There has been some report of confusion in some polling 
stations because of the existence of two (?discarded) boxes, but 
otherwise it has been very, very quiet, and the atmosphere has 
been extremely good. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report from Nampula by correspondent Eduardo Constantino] </F>
  [Text] Like at the port city of Nacala yesterday, the 
residents of the city of Nampula today asked President Joaquim 
Chissano to contest the general elections scheduled for 27-28 
October 1994. The request was made at a mass rally held at the 
Mozambique Railroad-North Square this morning. The rally was 
the highlight of the Mozambican head of state's visit to the 
province. Addressing more than 15,000 people, President 
Chissano said he will comply with the people's wishes and take 
part in the upcoming elections. 
  Chissano said long before he visited Gaza, Sofala, and Tete 
Provinces, people from various political parties mobilized the 
residents to neither welcome him nor to attend his rallies. 
Chissano said the same thing happened in Nampula -- namely, in 
Malema and Lalaua -- where scores of people were seen in those 
districts a few days before his arrival. Those people stirred 
the residents, telling them, quote, Chissano will no longer come 
here because he is afraid. He is afraid because he knows we are 
here, unquote. Despite those appeals, there were large numbers 
of people wherever the Mozambican head of state went. They sang 
and danced, something that surprised the head of state because 
he knew the living conditions under which they live. 
  Joaquim Chissano said a number of parties had said about a 
year ago that they had already won the elections in Nampula, 
Sofala, and Manica, and that Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation 
Front] and Chissano would only receive a few votes in southern 
Mozambique. In the north, they claimed, it is their country. 
Chissano added: Frelimo and I have been welcomed in those 
provinces, but we have not yet said we have won the elections. 
It is the people who will decide who the winner is. We are 
going to work to win the elections, but meanwhile we will not 
claim victory like they do. The Mozambican head of state said it 
is the people who should claim victory because they are the ones 
to decide who will rule the country in the future. 
  Like in other places where he chaired mass rallies, in the 
city of Nampula the president of the Republic once again 
stressed that the task of all of us right now is to uphold peace 
and national reconciliation, and to work hard in line with the 
principle of unity among all Mozambicans from north to south. 
  Right now the Mozambican head of state is scheduled to be in 
Nacaroa, Erati District, on his way to Namapa. This will mark 
the end of his visit to the province. Joaquim Chissano left the 
city of Nampula for Namapa at about 1500. During his trip he 
met the residents of Nacavala and Namialo in Meconta District. 
He is scheduled to meet the residents of Alua in Namapa 
District. He is scheduled to spend the night in Namapa. 
Tomorrow morning he will visit the local rural hospital, which 
has just been renovated. Also tomorrow morning, he will chair a 
mass rally in the capital of Namapa District. Tomorrow 
afternoon the head of state is scheduled to cross the Lurio 
River thus beginning his visit to Cabo Delgado Province.

<F P=106> [Report by Portuguese News Agency LUSA: "Government Will </F>
Spend $600 million to Repair Roads"] 
  [Text] Finance Minister Eneias Comiche said yesterday that, 
until 1996, the country will invest $600 million to repair Grade 
A and Grade B roads. Speaking at a seminar in Lisbon under the 
theme: "Mozambique -- Attractive Investment Opportunities", 
sponsored by Ernest Young Company, Eneias Comiche stressed that 
Mozambique has a propitious atmosphere for foreign investment, 
particularly Portuguese investment. He also said the country 
was a "door to southern Africa." 
  The Mozambican minister who was addressing over 200 
entrepreneurs, said the southern African region where Mozambique 
is found, has a market of more than 100 million inhabitants. 
Eneias Comiche stressed the existing potential for Portuguese 
investors in the field of the reorganization of the state 
enterprise sector, particularly with regard to privatization. 
  The minister said the Government gives priority to 
agricultural sector (particularly in the fields of cashew nuts, 
copra, and cotton) to attract Direct Foreign Investment. Eneias 
Comiche said this was an attractive sector because it deals with 
exports and other kinds of commodities which reduce imports and 
generate foreign exchange. He said other important sectors 
include the tourism and hotel industry, services, and the 
financial and insurance sectors. 
  The minister said the banking sector will not be privatized 
right away, pointing out that a study will be carried out until 
the middle of this year. "Only afterward, will we examine the 
possibility of accepting private participation in the sector", 
he said. 
  Comiche said Portuguese investors have expressed interest in 
the fields of banking, insurance, infrastructure, and mining.

acting director general Mr. Dunken Mbazima has confirmed that 
ZNBC is to introduce a pay channel on television. Mr. Mbazima 
said he has received many queries today about the pay channel

by the minister of information of broadcasting and services, Mr. 
Keli Walubita. The government has already approved the project 
and other formalities are now being worked out. Mr. Mbazima 
said ZNBC has been strapped for cash and this venture is 
expected to improve the corporation's financial standing. 
Viewers who will subscribe to the channel in areas outside 
Lusaka, the Copperbelt, and Livingstone transmitter coverage 
range will be serviced through the cellular network.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Now that the new democratic South Africa has come 
into being, other countries in southern Africa are beginning to 
wonder whether the new South Africa will dominate the region 
economically. Already a lot of international aid has been 
pledged to South Africa. America alone has promised $600 
million. Zimbabwe, South Africa's neighbor and a country with 
its own experience of racial division, is one of the countries 
most likely to lose out in the battle for international aid. 
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is in London on a state 
visit, and Julian Marshall asked him if Zimbabwe was now 
competing with South Africa for international aid. 
  [Begin recording] [Mugabe] Some competition is inevitable, 
and after all why shouldn't there be competition? If South 
Africa will have that investment, well and good, but there are 
also forms of investment which, because of the advantage that we 
have over South Africa, will come our way. Anyway, we can say 
that today as things stand, we are more peaceful and stable than 
South Africa, that we have had areas of greater development and 
progress than South Africa because of the problems they have 
had, and that this gives us here in some way and some areas that 
needed advantage. 
  [Marshall] How important is the white population in Zimbabwe 
-- I am thinking particularly of white farmers -- to the 
continued prosperity of the country? 
  [Mugabe] Very important. We still need commercial farming, 
and don't forget that commercial farming has to do with just 
more than production of food. We need cash crops; we need 
greater productivity in the commercial sector so we can compete. 
So, apart from the fact that we need more land from the 
commercial sector, and how acquiring this land is going to 
affect some of the farmers, apart from that problem, there is no 
other problem. Really, the commercial farmer, I mean, the white 
commercial farmer, is a happier person in Zimbabwe. 
  [Marshall] So, you do intend to continue with the process of 
the equitable redistribution of land? 
  [Mugabe] It is equity we are aiming at -- land which must 
come into the possession of the peasant community -- so that the 
peasant community has a resource and asset for the improvement 
of their economic position. 
  [Marshall] So, finally, given the experience of the white 
population in Zimbabwe in 14 years of independence, what is your 
message to the white people in South Africa? 
  [Mugabe] Our message is that they should look at how and why 
community in Zimbabwe -- white and black community -- have 
reconciled to each other, and I am glad that President Mandela 
has pronounced the policy of national reconciliation and 
national unity as guidelines for the people of South Africa, and 
I hope they do respond to his call in a social and economic way, 
reacting to it positively, trying to work together with the 
majority of the people in South Africa, and trying also to 
enhance the lot of the poor in their country. That way, there 
will be greater harmony and greater stability, and the whites in 
South Africa needn't fear of any repercussions, any policies of 
retributions in the future -- if this happened. [end recording]

  [Text] Parliament May 20 SAPA -- New president of the 
Senate Mr Kobie Coetsee undertook to do his best to promote a 
spirit of fairness, justice and impartiality in the house. 
Elected unanimously on Friday, he appealed to senators -- who 
had just been sworn in by Chief Justice Michael Corbett -- to 
co-operate in upholding the senate's dignity. "As president of 
the senate, one of my duties will be to see that the right of 
freedom of speech is upheld in the house." 
  After the swearing in of the new senators in the historic 
old 
senate chamber at Parliament, Mr Justice Corbett asked for 
nominations for the presidency. The National Party's chief whip 
Mr Attie Jooste proposed Mr Coetsee and Mr Alex van Breda, 
former chief whip of Parliament, seconded the proposal. Mr 
Coetsee was duly declared elected. 
  Mr Justice Corbett then called for nominations for deputy 
president. Former Rivonia trialist, Robben Island prisoner 
member of the ANC's National Executive Committee Mr Govan Mbeki 
was the sole nomination, proposed and seconded by the ANC's Mr 
Dennis Bloem and Ms Isabella Direko. Mr Mbeki, father of South 
Africa's first deputy president Mr Thabo Mbeki, was declared 
duly elected. 
  Mr Coetsee was then escorted to the president's chair by Mr 
Jooste and Mr van Breda to deliver a short speech to senators 
before adjournment. "I deem it a great privilege to have been 
elected to this first senate under the new constitution," he 
declared. "It is my pleasant duty to express my appreciation to 
the house for its confidence." He undertook to discharge his 
duties to the best of his abilities. "Let us never forget that 
a spirit of tolerance and good humour is conducive to good 
debate." 
  Mr Coetsee said the Senate would play an important role in 
South Africa's constitutional development, especially in view of 
its composition of 10 senators from each of the nine new 
provinces. 
  Among those watching proceedings from the public galleries 
was the speaker of the National Assembly, Dr Frene Ginwala; her 
deputy, Dr Bhadra Ranchod; and the Western Cape premier, Mr 
Hernus Kriel. 
  The African National Congress occupies benches from the 
president's right; with the Freedom Front and Democratic Party 
sandwiched in between the ANC and the National Party [NP] which 
occupies the first block of benches to the president's left. 
  There are 60 ANC senators, 17 from the NP, five each from 
the 
Inkatha Freedom Party and the Freedom Front and three from the 
Democratic Party.

concern that the ANC's reconstruction and development plan will 
cost twice as much as originally estimated. Addressing a news 
conference in London he said that the government would provide a 
better quality of life for everyone, but only by spending what 
it could afford. This might mean that the government would not 
reach the ANC's declared goal of one million new homes in five 
years. He said South Africa was not looking for handouts but 
for free trade and investment. Mr. De Klerk is in London to 
deliver the SUNDAY TIMES Nobel Laureate peace lecture.

police reported. A security guard became suspicious when the 
four white men drove past the house in a red 16-valve Golf 
without registration plates at 11.40AM. He opened fire with a 
shotgun when two of the men jumped over the back garden wall. 
It is not known if either of the men was hit. Anyone with

  [Text] Cape Town May 19 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress has a marginally higher percentage membership in the 
Constitutional Assembly than in the National Assembly, although 
still short of the two-thirds majority which would have enabled 
it to unilaterally rewrite South Africa's constitution. 
  The Constitutional Assembly (CA), to be constituted on 
Tuesday, comprises the 400 National Assembly (NA) members who 
were sworn in last Monday, sitting together with the 90 senators 
to be sworn in Friday (MAy 20). 
  The CA is to be tasked with writing South Africa's final 
constitution over the next two years, applying 34 principles set 
out in the interim constitution. 
  The ANC will have 252 NA members and 60 senators, giving it 
63.67 per cent of the seats in the Constitutional Assembly 
compared with 63 per cent in the NA. 
  The National Party, with 82 members in the NA and 17 in the 
Senate, will have 20.20 per cent of the seats in the CA compared 
with 20.5 in the NA. 
  The Inkatha Freedom Party has 9.79 per cent of the seats in 
the CA, the Freedom Front 2.85, the Democratic Party 2.04, the 
Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] 1.02 and the African Christian 
Democratic Party [ACDP] 0.4. Neither the PAC nor the ACDP has 
any senators.

  [Text] The Public Servants Association of South Africa has 
warned that serious unrest could result from the nonpayment of 
special danger allowances promised to Correctional Services 
personnel over the election period. The newly-appointed general 
manager of the association, Mr. Casper van Rensburg, said the 
association would take all the necessary steps to ensure that 
its Correctional Services members were paid the special 
allowance which was granted to other uniformed personnel.

  [Text] The Conservative Party's [CP] Executive Committee 
has decided that the party will continue promoting the ideal of 
a free Afrikaner nation with new zeal and enthusiasm. 
  CP leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said the CP remains convinced 
that a nation's right to self-determination can only be realized 
in a sovereign volkstaat [homeland]. No freedom of nations is 
possible within a unitary state. 
  The Afrikaner National Front [AVF] has also decided to 
recommit itself to the attainment of a sovereign Christian 
Boer/Afrikaner republic. 
  Dr. Hartzenberg, also leader of the AVF, said the AVF was 
appealing to all Boer/Afrikaners to join them, and in so doing 
become involved in the realization of a volkstaat. 
  Dr. Hartzenberg has no doubts whatsoever that the majority 
of 
Afrikaners are in favor of a volkstaat and self-determination. 
This support, however, was not reflected in the outcome of the 
election because the majority of CP supporters did not vote. 
  He said in a statement: "We are happy we did not take part 
in the election, because now we can say that we did not become 
part of the fiasco surrounding the election, nor did we commit 
ourselves to abandoning in any way the Afrikaner people's claim 
to freedom." 
  According to him, the election was definitely not free and 
fair. There were blatant irregularities, and under a new 
government the country is heading for an administrative disaster. 
  "The CP will not become irrelevant by not participating in 
the country's new parliamentary politics. We will still voice 
our protests loudly and clearly against any measure by the 
government which will be detrimental to the country's future. 
The CP was created then to bring about freedom and 
self-determination for the Afrikaner people. This task has only 
just begun." 
  The CP's biggest task is to bring about complete unity among 
Afrikaners and to promote relations with other peace-loving 
peoples in order to gain more bargaining power. 
  The CP will remain a fully fledged political party which 
will 
act outside Parliament in every sphere of life as a fighter for 
the rights of its supporters. 
  "I am not in anyway sorry that the CP did not participate in 
the election. Today the whole world knows that the CP was not 
part of the election. Nobody would have known about our claims 
to self-determination had we been part of the new system. We 
could not have achieved anything inside Parliament as we would 
have been outvoted. Outside the new parliament we can do exactly 
the same as we did in the old parliament." 
  Dr. Hartzenberg said the CP is to introduce a political 
strategy which will lead to the self-determination of the 
Afrikaner nation. There will again be a transitional process in 
the country -- from a communist controlled unitary state to real 
freedom. The CP will then be in the forefront.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Housing Minister Joe Slovo by SABC </F>
announcer John Bishop on the "Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Bishop] With me, Mr. Joe Slovo, the minister of 
national housing. Before the election the ANC/SACP [South 
African Communist Party] alliance promised one million houses 
over the next five years. There are, it seems, between five and 
seven million people desperately waiting to be housed, as we've 
just seen from the report from "Canaan" [an informal squatter 
settlement]. What would you say to the people there? 
  [Slovo] All I can say is that what we've seen on this very 
moving film is the measure of the desperate housing situation 
which our government has inherited. When you consider the needs 
of the people in this country against the background for example 
of what's been done in the last five years where only an average 
of 25,000 houses were built, you are not going to be able to 
answer people like this unless you heed the call which the 
gentleman made toward the end, and that is that we must move 
with speed. 
  [Bishop] Now you've only been four days in office. You're 
doing a lot; you were telling me just before the program. How 
is it going and what's the plan? 
  [Slovo] The plan is to use this initial period to create the 
conditions in which the housing program can be launched in 
earnest. In the meanwhile, of course, there are ongoing projects 
like the subsidy scheme, which we will push with greater 
intensity, but fundamentally we cannot address the housing 
question without an effective partnership between the state, the 
private sector, and the communities. And what we've been doing 
in these four days is that we have covered in this brief span of 
time, consultations with virtually the whole sector of the 
industrial, financial, and construction field in the housing 
sector, and the impression that we have got from these 
discussions is that we are ready -- with the collaboration of 
the people who have got the means and the resources, to make a 
reality out of the objective which we have set ourselves of 
building these one million houses within the first five years. 
  [Bishop] That sounds promising, and it centers on money, 
doesn't it? 
  [Slovo] It centers on money. 
  [Bishop] How immediately will you raise that money, Mr. 
Slovo? 
  [Slovo] Our estimate is -- it's a rough estimate at this 
stage -- that to build those million houses in five years will 
require something like 30 billion rands. Now before you 
collapse and the stock exchange collapses, let me say this that 
this is not necessarily government input. The government will 
have to make an input, but it will also depend upon the extent 
to which the private sector is prepared to talk with its money 
in trying to solve this problem, and that in turn depends on 
whether we in government can in this early period create the 
kind of market conditions which will give private sector 
confidence that their investments will not go down the drain, 
which is what happened in the previous period, and which 
resulted in a lockout on the black housing section by private 
business. 
  [Bishop] Without wanting to be cruel, do you think the mass 
of those people -- the poorest of the poor -- will understand 
that probably if they are going to be housed, they will have to 
pay for it, but probably they won't have jobs. How do you get 
that message through? 
  [Slovo] Let me say this: It's a bit of a chicken and egg 
situation. We believe that the spurt in housing construction is 
the single most important factor in making a kick start to the 
economy and particularly in job creation. You know the 
statistic is that for every million rands invested in housing, 
you get a 120 jobs created directly, and 80 jobs indirectly, and 
if you compare that, for instance, to the textile sector with a 
similar amount, all you get is 30 jobs; the chemical sector 225 
jobs. You will see that the housing industry is one of the most 
important elements in socio- economic development because it's 
not just housing. It's electricity, it's water, it's sewerage, 
it's roads, and it's also all the things that go with housing 
because if you've got a house, it's not just four walls and a 
roof and the floor. It's got to have equipment; it's got to 
have furniture. It creates a consumer boom and therefore the 
momentum which the housing program can create is the single most 
important factor in the thrust which we're trying to get in the 
economy. 
  [Bishop] Mr. Slovo, you mentioned incentives for the 
private sector. What incentives are you putting out for them? 
  [Slovo] Well, briefly, we are at the moment discussing a 
mortgage indemnity scheme which will protect private sectors 
from non-commercial risks. 
  [Bishop] Backed by government? 
  [Slovo] Backed by government, yes. Also the creation of a 
wholesale national housing bank which will be able to cheapen 
the housing costs, the housing money which flows into the 
market. In brief, those are the two key areas. Also getting 
the subsidy scheme off the ground. We've got money at the 
moment to continue upgrading hostels, which we are going to 
intensify in the coming period, and as I say, with these 
institutions that will be created, we believe that we are going 
to create what the private sector wants, and that's a degree of 
market certainty, and they are a vital element in this. 
  [Bishop] Talking of certainties, some of the haves have been 
rather worried that your government might, what they say, steal 
from them to give to the poor -- higher taxes, punishing budget. 
Comment? 
  [Slovo] Even if we steal from them, and punish them a little 
-- which we don't want to do, we neither want to steal or punish 
-- that won't solve the housing problem. The scale of the 
problem is such that we've got to find the kind of ways that 
I've tried to describe. We got to get international capital 
involved, and we've got to get, I believe as housing minister, a 
bigger share of the budget for the housing program. 
  [Bishop] Any big money coming from overseas specifically for 
housing? 
  [Slovo] Not in the four days that I have been there, but 
there have been very, very positive noises that we've heard, and 
we are going to follow them up. 
  [Bishop] The question of the kind of houses you would build: 
would they be those monstrous high-rise blocks that have been 
tested, city after city in Europe after the last war. They 
ended up as sort of ghettos; really, there is no other word for 
it. 
  [Slovo] For the low-cost housing market, obviously we are 
not 
going to be able to build mansions, but within the limitations 
of the resources we are very conscious of the need not to create 
regimented people who live in regimented houses; and we are not 
in favor of these high-rise blocks. But at the same time we are 
also considering rental accommodation, blocks of three, four, 
five stories of the sort which I think will be acceptable. And 
the point I want to make about this is that all the major 
housing projects that we have in mind will be determined in 
consultation with the people who are going to live in them -- 
the community. 
  [Bishop] That's what I wanted to get to next. The people who 
are occupying land, whether it be government land or what we 
used to call squatter settlements, private land. How are you 
going to approach that delicate problem? I mean, you might 
have to get them out of there. 
  [Slovo] Only today we had discussions with SANCO [South 
African National Civic Organization] on this very question. The 
point they made is that there's no way of appealing to people 
who do this kind of thing to get off the land, or to leave 
unless they are convinced that there are alternatives, and at 
the root of solving this problem is to act with such dispatch 
and such speed in this sector that people are going to realize 
that although there might be a bit of a delay, there are going 
to be deliveries. 
  [Bishop] When do you expect the first delivery? 
  [Slovo] It must start virtually immediately. With the 
resources that we've got in the Housing Ministry budget at the 
moment for new projects, we've only got close to one billion 
rand. But we're hoping that as soon as these other institutions 
get off the ground, the pace will be stepped up. We're trying 
to have one million houses in five years; this means -- if you 
take out your calculator -- it means building every single 
working day 850 houses. Now we are not going to be able to start 
next Monday doing that, but we are going to be able to reach 
that kind of average within a pretty short time, and although in 
the first year there might be less, it will be stepped up in the 
second year, and our target will be reached. 
  [Bishop] Now we have Mr. Tokyo Sexwale in the main news 
talking about ambitious plans for the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], which leads me on to this: You are 
the national housing minister. There are now nine regions. 
They will have responsibility for housing. Are you going to be 
able to interlock successfully and not fight against one another? 
  [Slovo] That's the key. There won't be conflict between the 
center and the regions on this question. I have organized for 
next Thursday in Cape Town a meeting with all those responsible 
for housing in the provinces, and we are going to discuss how to 
approach the question together. 
  [Bishop] Last question before we close: Why did you say 
goodbye to Mr. Louis Koch, DG [Director General] of your 
department of housing and replace him with Mr. Billy Cobbett, 
spokesman for the ANC? 
  [Slovo] First of all it was a mutual arrangement between 
myself and Mr. Koch. 
  [Bishop] No discrimination? 
  [Slovo] Without any discrimination, I admire Mr. Koch. He's 
a highly professional civil servant. He accepted the fact that 
with the new government the key political position at the 
administrative level of the ministry must be somebody who is 
steeped in our RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program]. 
But let me say something, John, about what I found at the 
ministry. I was absolutely overwhelmed by the talent, the 
experience, the loyalty, the dedication of the 300-odd people 
that I met in the ministry, and if that a microcosm of what is 
happening in South Africa, in the rest of the country, I think 
we're going to make all of us together. 
  [Bishop] Your departmental people will be glowing with 
health 
hearing those remarks. Thank you very much. 
  [Slovo] Thank you.

  [Text] Jay Naidoo, minister without portfolio, who is 
responsible for the implementation of the Reconstruction and 
Development Program [RDP], today declined to comment on recent 
estimates of its cost. Speaking in Pretoria, he said President 
Mandela would address the RDP issue in his state-of-the-nation 
speech in Parliament next Tuesday. 
  [Begin recording] [Naidoo] The costing of the RDP is still 
being quantified by a team that has been working for several 
months on the quantification exercise. But we are confident 
that we have a plan to start the RDP in this financial year, and 
to also maintain the macroeconomic balance that is necessary, 
the fiscal discipline that is necessary, and to be able to 
deliver the goods and services to our people. That plan will be 
enunciated in the state president's address on Tuesday. 
  [Unidentified reporter] You also indicated that the RDP is 
not purely an ANC policy, but that it is the result of 
across-the-board discussions. 
  [Naidoo] Yes, the RDP program now has been accepted as the 
vehicle by all political parties. We obviously have to now work 
on detailing more policy directions that are needed to implement 
the program, and there are on-going discussions that are taking 
place, but ultimately the new government of national unity will 
operate within the framework of the RDP. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria May 19 SAPA -- Water affairs and forestry 
minister Prof Kader Asmal on Thursday unveiled his department's 
new initiatives and policy adaptations to make water and 
sanitation available to all communities in South Africa. Prof 
Asmal told a media conference in Pretoria the initiatives were 
aimed at achieving the objectives of the government's 
Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) and his 
department hoped to achieve its immediate goals within the next 
three years. 
  For many years the department had functioned in terms of 
political assumptions which had now changed fundamentally. This 
called for the department and all water related institutions in 
the country to change direction towards achieving water security 
and safe sanitation for all South Africans. "The urgent task of 
the department is to transfer the functions from the myriad of 
authorities which existed under the homelands in such a way that 
the national interest is not affected as a result." The 
department would prepare draft legislation to consolidate and 
rationalise water laws so a single system prevailed throughout 
the country, he said. 
  Prof Asmal said a revised water act would be necessary to 
implement the policy changes. "All numerous amendments 
promulgated since 1956 will have to be rationalised and the act 
will have to be updated to reflect the changes and to provide 
legislative framework for the equitable, rational and 
non-competitive distribution of water," he said. A draft white 
paper would be published with an invitation for public comment. 
  Prof Asmal said for the department to achieve its goals it 
would need maximum involvement of all stakeholders, including 
communities at grassroots level. The department was reviewing 
all water related institutions in order to ensure transparency 
and accountability. Effective representation of all citizens and 
users on water institutions would be a priority. 
  Prof Asmal said his department was already in the process of 
establishing a directorate of rural water supply and sanitation 
to support rural communities in the task of achieving water 
security and safe sanitation. Control of rural water supply and 
sanitation would be co-ordinated by local committees in which 
women had to play an important role, said Prof Asmal. The 
department would also involve non-governmental organisations, 
local authorities, water boards, the private sector and 
provincial authorities, while it would play a monitoring and 
supportive role to ensure the RDP's objectives were met. 
  On tariffs, he said a lifeline tariff for low income 
consumers was likely to be sufficient to cover the operating 
costs so South Africans at all levels were able to afford water 
services. He said training programmes linked with universities, 
bursary schemes and recruitment processes would be reviewed to 
alleviate the shortage of professional and technical staff. A 
new departure for the department was the planned establishment 
of the national water council to increase public involvement in 
water policy formulation, resource appointments and financial 
allocations. Other issues that his department was already 
looking into were forestry, conservation, international 
developments, the national public works programme and funding 
requirements.

<F P=106> [Article by Jacquie Golding] </F>
  [Text] The ANC plans to increase the health budget from 3.4 
percent of GDP to 4 percent, raising government expenditure on 
health care to more than R[Rand]12bn. 
  The hike, proposed in the ANC's national health plan 
presented in Johannesburg yesterday, represents a shift from 
11.5 percent to at least 13 percent of last year's Budget. 
  ANC health department head Dr Ralph Mgijima said the plan 
set 
out a five-year progamme to create a single, integrated national 
health system based on effective primary health care and funded 
through existing taxation. 
  "A single government structure will co-ordinate all aspects 
of both the public and private health care delivery and all 
existing departments will be integrated." 
  In addition to general taxation, ANC health advisers 
recommended increased excise on tobacco and alcohol of up to 100 
percent. They added that reduced expenditure by other 
government departments such as defence could see extra funds 
being diverted to health. 
  "Additional expenditure can be immediately derived by 
increasing taxes on tobacco which will have an added effect of 
reducing consumption," Mgijima said. 
  The plan, which includes a strong emphasis on building up 
the public health service and discouraging expansion of the 
private sector, was presented to Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma 
yesterday and was likely to become official health policy. 
  The comprehensive plan, which also recommended the 
zero-rating of basic foodstuffs, would be "thoroughly discussed" 
with the Finance Department, said Mgijima, adding that the ANC 
strongly supported moves to extend VAT exemption to medicines 
and medical services. 
  As a means of achieving an equitable health care system, the 
report urges the Health Minister to recommend next month that, 
among other things, free medical services be provided to 
children under the age of six, the elderly, the disabled and 
pregnant and nursing mothers. 
  It also called on government to urgently appoint a 
commission 
of inquiry to examine the crisis in the medical aid sector and 
to consider alternatives such as a compulsory national health 
insurance system. 
  It proposed that, in addition to general taxation, health 
care be funded by an insurance system based on employer and 
employee contributions. 
  The proposed commission of inquiry is expected to 
investigate 
the economic feasibility of such an insurance scheme and 
undertake planning if there is sufficient consensus on the 
option. 
  The investigation into an insurance system would be based on 
whether current medical schemes could form its basis and whether 
existing schemes met specified statutory conditions governing 
the health insurance system. 
  The ANC's health plan suggests that membership be compulsory 
for all formal sector employees and their dependents and that 
the health coverage provided by the scheme be statutory defined. 
  Existing health insurance companies and medical schemes 
would 
be free to offer "top-up" cover for services not covered in the 
insurance package, said Mgijima, adding that the long-term goal 
would be for all citizens, including the unemployed, to be 
covered under the system. 
  An Econometrix senior economist said the zero-rating of more 
basic foodstuffs was better than government food subsidies, and 
said government could make up for the lost revenue by increasing 
taxes on "luxuries" such as tobacco and alcohol.

  [Text] The ANC has suspended its application to the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] to have the election 
results in KwaZulu/Natal set aside. 
  IEC chairman Judge Johann Kriegler and vice-chairman Dikgang 
Moseneke said yesterday the ANC's lawyers had asked that the 
application be "put on ice" after earlier serving papers on the 
IEC's Special Electoral Court. The ANC has until the 
dismantling of the IEC at the end of next month to reopen the 
matter, if it so chooses. 
  Kriegler declared the elections substantially free and fair 
in the face of an ANC request that the results in Natal/KwaZulu 
be declared null and void after widespread claims of voting 
irregularities in the area. IEC sources indicated that the 
ANC's application would have little chance of success.

  [Text] Senior police officers have committed themselves to 
upholding the constitution and fighting against crime and 
violence. The commitments were made this morning during 
discussions between the minister of safety and security, Mr. 
Sydney Mufamadi, and his deputy, Mr. Joe Matthews. The police 
said in a statement that members would work together in a 
professional, unbiased, and apolitical way in the service of the 
community. The senior officers assured all policemen that they 
would be handled in a reasonable and fair way at all times.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the South African Police Public </F>
Relations on the SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] The General Staff of the South African Police 
Service (now including all the former police forces of the TVBC 
[Transkei - Bophuthatswana - Venda - Ciskei] and self governing 
territories) today held in-depth discussions, on a wide range of 
policing issues, with Mr Sydney Mufamadi, the minister of safety 
and security and his deputy, Mr Joe Mathews. 
  The generals pledged their full commitment to uphold the 
constitution and assured Ministers Mufamadi and Mathews of their 
full support in the fight against crime and violence. 
  The South African Police Service would perform its duty in a 
professional, impartial and non-political manner, in service of 
all the people of South Africa. 
  Although the challenges facing policing in South Africa were 
formidable, South Africa could be made a much safer and more 
secure country with the full co-operation of the community. 
  Reconciliation and nation-building were also priorities for 
the South African Police Service, which looked forward to 
providing the security necessary for democracy and economic 
growth to flourish in South Africa. 
  The General Staff also assured all members of the South 
African Police Service that they had nothing to fear and would 
always be treated in a fair and just manner. 
  Members who conducted themselves in a professional manner 
had 
no reason whatsoever to fear for their jobs or security. 
  The General Staff again committed itself to serving and 
promoting the professional interests of all South African Police 
Service members.

<F P=106> [Article by Stephanie Bothma] </F>
  [Text] Pretoria -- SA [South Africa] had grown into the 
10th largest armaments supplier in the world and hoped to reap 
the full benefits of its expertise as soon as the UN arms 
embargo was lifted, Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South 
Africa] marketing general manager Peet Smith said yesterday. 
  The armaments procurement company had issued 631 export 
permits for arms worth more than 820m R[rand] over the past two 
years. 
  Smith told military correspondents at a briefing that SA 
would most likely become a member of the Missile Technology 
Control Regime by October and Armscor was positioning itself for 
this prospect. 
  SA was finalising a national arms control policy in terms of 
which all arms-related control measures would be centralised 
under the Defence Ministry, he said. 
  "Armscor has committed itself to becoming more transparent 
and accountable, especially regarding aspects such as its arms 
exports in international terms." 
  But, Smith said, Armscor found it difficult to thoroughly 
police the final destiny and use of armaments manufactured in SA 
because of a lack of co-operation between government bodies such 
as the SA Police Services, Customs and Excise and the Trade and 
Industry Department. 
  However, Armscor was committed to adhering to government 
regulations and rules regarding client countries. Smith said SA 
had a firm policy in terms of export clients and would under no 
circumstances export to certain countries. 
  He said the list of client countries was classified, but, 
for 
example, SA had stopped supplying Rwanda several months ago when 
civil war broke out there. 
  Smith said although Armscor suggested clients to whom SA 
should sell its armaments, government had the final say in the 
matter. "After all, we are only civil servants." 
  Smith agreed that Armscor, to a certain extent, had a 
credibility problem because of its operations during the 
sanctions years. But he said the company "never allowed anybody 
in the industry to break SA's own rules and regulations". 
  He said it was Armscor's first priority to have the UN 
embargoes lifted, and to achieve that, it would not tolerate any 
transgression of any international regulation.

  [Text] Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] has 
admitted issuing marketing permits to the South African 
armaments industry to supply military equipment to Rwanda. 
However, the manager of import and export at Armscor, Mr. Peet 
Smith, said that this had been stopped as soon as the civil war

year to standardize the country's military equipment and to buy 
only South African products.

<F P=106> [By David Isaacson] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg May 19 SAPA -- PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale has promised 
150,000 low cost houses as part of an upliftment programme for 
the province. 
  Delivering his opening address to the PWV Legislative 
Assembly at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center], near Soweto on 
Thursday, he also outlined various campaigns to combat crime and 
provide education and health. 
  "The projected target for the provision of housing in the 
province over the next 12 months is 150,000 units." The premier 
said the units would be provided with all essential services 
including electricity, running water and telephones. But he 
warned the provincial government would not allow the scheme, 
which would be aided by private enterprises, "to create serviced 
informal settlements in the name of housing". 
  Turning to hostels, Mr Sexwale said: "We have the 
responsibility of reintegrating hostel dwellers into the broader 
community. Hostel accommodation can be upgraded into family 
units and alternative housing provided. Hostel dwellers who 
wish to remain in hostels should be assisted to upgrade their 
facilities." 
  Mr Sexwale also promised that township residents who fled 
their homes because of violence would be assisted in returning 
to their houses which would be restored. 
  The premier also promised to create sustainable employment 
for the almost 50 per cent of people "without formal or adequate 
employment". Creating an enabling economic environment would 
depend on stability, which in turn would be created by urgent 
reconstruction and development projects. "We need a vigorous 
cycle of progress in the PWV." 
  Mr Sexwale said education and health policies would be 
shaped 
for the province after central government had formulated its 
policies. But he promised free, compulsory and basic education 
to all school- going children, and an urgent immunisation 
programme. 
  Reiterating his strong stance against crime, he said there 
would be gun control and a disarmament campaign. "A crime-free 
PWV has the potential to serve as the economic gateway not only 
to the rest of South Africa, but also to the sub-continent. 
Within the first 100 days we will establish a comprehensive and 
regularly updated economic data base to facilitate the marketing 
of our province and country." 
  Mr Sexwale said the provincial government would maintain 
fiscal discipline and "use our resources wisely and 
efficiently". "We as government will stretch every rand before 
we can spend yet another rand." 
  Throughout his speech, Mr Sexwale stressed partnerships in 
all policy formulation. "At a political level the government of 
national unity, characterised by the ongoing process of 
reconciliation in the PWV, has provided a tangible example of 
partnership in action that should pervade all aspects of our 
society." 
  Earlier, the Provincial Assembly adopted an interim set of 
procedural rules. The PWV legislature will sit again on Monday.

<F P=106> [Report by Greta Steyn] </F>
  [Text] Government planned to cut the general export 
incentive scheme (GEIS) by about half its present budget in the 
1995/96 fiscal year, a Trade and Industry Department spokesman 
said yesterday. 
  He confirmed that a R[Rand] 500m-R800m cut would be a first 
step towards phasing out the incentive scheme, which was in 
contravention of GATT. But at least some of the savings from 
eliminating GEIS would be used to finance supply-side measures. 
  A plan to achieve the cut had not been finalised and 
"several 
alternatives that differ substantially" were being discussed by 
the National Economic Forum's trade policy task force. A 
decision was expected next month. 
  Industry sources said there was strong resistance from 
sections of the business community to an approach suggested by 
the Trade and Industry Department. It is understood the 
department wants to change the criteria for qualifying, rather 
than make an across-the- board cut. 
  The approach would harm industries that are especially 
dependent on the export subsidies, particularly the steel 
industry. A source said a battle was expected over the next few 
weeks. 
  It is also understood industry is hoping SA will negotiate 
an 
extension of the benefits beyond the December 31 1997 cut-off. 
Talk is that SA's trading partners are willing to allow the 
scheme to continue for up to another three years. The spokesman 
said an extension would have to be negotiated with the World 
Trade Organisation. 
  The demand for GEIS subsidies has been growing rapidly. 
  The department said the R1,67bn budget in the past fiscal 
year would have been exceeded if it had not been for the 
"significant" backlog of claims. 
  The NEF has set up a subcommittee to look at supply-side 
measures that could make up for the cut in GEIS. 
  These could include giving greater access to duty-free 
imports.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 20 SAPA -- Thirty-two right-wingers 
facing charges including murder and attempted murder arising out 
of pre-election bombings in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] were granted bail on Friday by the Johannesburg 
regional court. 
  This follows an unsuccessful application by the state on 
Friday morning to re-open its case. State prosecutor Mr Koos 
Pretorius wanted to recall the investigating officer in the 
case, Col Neels van Wyk, to lead further evidence on why the 
accused should be denied bail. 
  Magistrate C J van Heerden dismissed the application because 
the provision in the Criminal Procedures Act relied on by the 
state was for criminal proceedings and not for bail 
applications. He said, in granting the accused bail, the state 
had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities the men's 
release would not be in the interests of justice. 
  Mr van Heerden said the state had not proved that any of the 
accused were directly involved in the bombings. He said the 
state's submission that no further bombings had taken place 
since the men's arrest was not necessarily indicative of their 
guilt. 
  Proceedings were adjourned for discussion of bail terms.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  ANC's Development Plan Facing "Credibility Problem" -- The 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 19 May in a page 18 
editorial criticizes the ANC's recent accessment of the cost of 
the Reconstruction and Development Plan, RDP. "Minister without 
Portfolio Jay Naidoo has reassured the nation that 'there is no 
need for alarm bells to be ringing' now that the ANC economic 
think-tank has found that the RDP will command a price tag of 
between R[rand]80 billion and R90 billion estimate that was 
doing the rounds ahead of the elections. We're reading Naidoo's 
lips, but the message isn't convincing. Had the programme not 
been a major cornerstone of the Government's economic strategy 
(as President Mandela often emphasised) and had the before and 
after projections not been as skewed as they are, the alarm 
bells may have been muted. In the event, they are ringing in a 
host of awkward questions, to which answers must be forthcoming 
if the new Government is not to suffer a credibility crisis in 
the early stages of its term of office." 
BUSINESS DAY 
<H8> </H8>
    "Greater Clarity" Wanted Regarding RDP -- "South Africa can 
no longer waste time looking at its economy through rose-tinted 
spectacles," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 
19 May in a page 8 editorial. "Our national propensity to spend 
beyond our means is clear from the estimates of budget overruns 
that are the legacy of spending on the election and the 
transition to majority government. Now we have new estimates 
from the ANC's National Institute for Economic Policy that the 
reconstruction and development programme is likely to cost more 
than R80 billion over the next five years rather than the R39bn 
we were led to believe before the election." The editorial 
questions "what was to be gained by earlier insistence that the 
lower figure was correct. Transperency seems to be one loser in 
this particular exercise in public accounting." Turning to 
another issue the new government must address, the editorial 
states that "as we have pointed out before, South Africa's new 
militarists are already trying to ensure that our military 
budget is not pared. Yet unless it is, we are likely to find 
that foreign lenders and aid providers deliver less than they 
promised." 
SOWETAN 
<H8> </H8>
    Need To Address Salaries of Public Servants -- "The new 
Government will make a grave mistake early in its tenure if it 
fails to respond adequately to concerns about the salaries and 
perks of public servants," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on 19 May in a page 8 editorial. "So far, there has 
been a muted response from our new parliamentarians to the 
recommendations of the TEC [Transitional Executive 
Council]-appointed Melamet Committee which, among other things, 
substantially increases Parliament's salary bill. Those who 
have responded by saying they will donate a percentage of their 
salary to party coffers, or President Nelson Mandela's intention 
to donate part of his to a children's fund, miss the point. We 
were hoping our new representatives, who have a history of 
struggle and sacrifice for the common good, would not be 
persuaded to board the `gravy train'." The new government needs 
to set "new standards of honesty, propriety and thrift in public 
life." The editorial continues by stating that although it is 
easy to dismiss those economists who "still cling pathetically 
to failed `trickle-down Reaganomics'," it not so easy to dismiss 
them when they say that "our economy will not grow if public 
spending is not brought under control and a bloated, `fat-cat' 
civil service is not trimmed."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Constitutional Court Selection -- Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English in an editorial on page 12 on 20 May calls for 
"openness" in the selection of a Constitutional Court. After 
noting that the Judicial Service Commission will nominate ten 
people for membership on the Constitutional Court, the editorial 
warns that "there is no guarantee" that the commission's 
hearings "will be open to the media. On the contrary, arguments 
are even being offered in defence of closed hearings. The new 
democratic order owes it to itself...to ensure that the 
questioning of candidates by the Judicial Service Commission is 
audible and visible -- through the media -- to ordinary 
citizens." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 17 May says in a 
page-10 editorial: "The new constitution came into effect last 
month. The first full session of Parliament will take place 
next week. But one of the cornerstones of the new 
constitutional dispensation, namely the Constitutional Court, is 
still lacking. This court is the most important mechanism built 
into the constitution to guard the constitution....Already there 
are indications that several important matters will land on this 
court's table within months, relating especially to such 
sensitive issues as lanOuage and land rights. It is therefore 
of the utmost importance that the president sets the wheels in 
motion as soon as possible to establish the Judicial Services 
Commission -- which must recommend suitable members for 
appointment to the court -- and the Constitutional Court 
itself....In order to ensure broad credibility in the 
institution as a watchdog over the constitution, it will be 
necessary that the appointment process is as transparent as 
possible. There must be no secret deals between political 
parties wishing to get their candidates appointed; that could 
discredit this cornerstone. Every possible care must be taken 
to ensure that the most qualified people are considered for this 
exceptional task." 
  Educational Issues A Priority -- A second editorial on page 
10 says: "The insistence in black educational circles that all 
empty and underused schools be put to full use as quickly as 
possible has merit. However, this is a relatively small part of 
a solution to the educational problems in South Africa. Put 
another way, overfull schools in black areas are certainly a 
problem, but an even greater problem is that most of those 
schools stand empty for much of the school year. That is due to 
the culture of absence, strikes, and boycotts which has 
developed among black students and teachers over the past two 
decades as a result of various factors. Many of the reasons for 
these actions still remain, but the major political grievance 
was removed last week with the inauguration of President Nelson 
Mandela, and the remaining problems can now be tackled in all 
seriousness....The greatest educational priority for South 
Africa now, though, is getting all school children back in their 
desks and all teachers in front of the blackboard." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Regional Economic Leadership Urged -- Johannesburg BUSINESS 
DAY in English in a page-10 editorial on 20 May argues that the 
election in Malawi is an opportunity for South Africa to begin 
"to lead our part of the continent out of the morass." The 
editorial continues: "We must not only ditch the controls that 
restrain our own economy, we must be prepared to accept the 
consequences of assuming regional leadership -- a free flow of 
skills, goods and capital from and to our neighbors." The paper 
calls on President Mandela to use next week's 
state-of-the-nation speech to encourage emigres to return to 
South Africa and to "enunciate a credible economic strategy that 
cannot be derailed by expedient politicians." 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  Understaffed Ministries -- Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; 
GUARDIAN in English, in an editorial on page 30 of its 20-26 May 
issue, voices concern over the small number civil servants in 
key government ministries. It cites the Housing Ministry as one 
example of an understaffed ministry, and expresses particular 
concern that the Defense Ministry and the Safety and Security 
Ministry do not have enough muscle to effectively take charge of 
the army and the police. The editorial concludes: "Although 
under pressure to cut civil service costs, the cabinet must face 
the fact that some critical departments may have to grow if they 
are to assert civil and political control over the state 
bureaucracy." 
  Labor Unrest -- Johannesburg NEW NATION in English publishes 
on page 14 of its 20 May edition an editorial expressing concern 
that labor unrest among civil servants in some former homelands 
represents a threat to the country's democratic process. "We 
believe," the paper notes, "that workers...would be prepared to 
delay mass action to allow all channels of communication to be 
exhausted....It surely cannot serve the best interests of the 
same workers to undermine or sabotage the new government without 
giving it a chance to prove itself." If workers strike before 
exhausting all other avenues of communication, the editorial 
argues, they risk "falling into the hands" of the "enemies of 
our new democracy." The editorial concludes: "We urge Public 
Service and Administration minister Zola Skweyiya to immediately 
put together a team of Directors-General to travel with him 
throughout the country to assure civil servants that their 
grievances are being addressed."

<F P=106> [Article by Tollys Bebo: "An Unduly Custom-Tailored Law" -- </F>
first paragraph NOTRE TEMPS introduction; quotation marks as 
published] 
  [Text] A bill concerning the electoral code, which is 
being drafted for the government by the Interior Ministry, 
should be submitted to the National Assembly soon for discussion 
and approval. Although there is nothing to criticize about the 
initiative, which meets the wishes of almost the entire 
political class, the same cannot be said of certain 
repercussions which, in some cases, are rather confusing. 
  The need in this new political context to clean up or even 
remodel the Ivorian electoral code in its present form is 
unanimously accepted by almost all the leading electoral 
partners. This has been the case for ages. Back in November 
1992, Mr. Henri Konan Bedie, then the speaker of the National 
Assembly, publicly called for a new electoral code, while in 
Ouragahio. A few months later, in March 1993, his party, the 
Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI], stated during its 
conclave that the Ivorian electoral code "must be judiciously 
and moderately reviewed...." Mr. Bernard Zadi Zaourou of the 
Union of Social Democrats has made this one of his conditions 
for remaining in the government. "The 1990 Electoral Code must 
not be functioning in 1995.... (otherwise) I will leave 
government and give the reasons for my action." Leaders from the 
Union of Democratic Forces, which is composed of six political 
parties -- the Ivorian Workers Party, the Liberal Party of Cote 
d'Ivoire, the UND [expansion unknown], the Democratic and Social 
Movement, the PPS [expansion unknown], and the African Party for 
Ivorian Rebirth -- are calling for a new electoral code. It 
also known that the Ivorian Popular Front [FPI] has made the 
drafting of a new code one of the highlights of its program, 
stating that it constitutes one base for a free and open 
election. It even presented a list of proposals to former Prime 
Minister Alassane Dramane Ouattara -- a gesture which it 
reiterated with his successor, Daniel Kablan Duncan. 
  All this goes to show that the leading political 
protagonists 
on the national political scene, who are the first concerned by, 
or at least the most attentive to, the electoral code, want 
something new. People believe in the advent of this new system, 
because the government office in charge of the elections let the 
people have a glimmer of hope. Reporting the remarks of one of 
Mr. Emile Constant Bombet's advisers in December 1992, which at 
the time we attributed to leaks, we published the following: 
"Leaks coming from the Interior Ministry say that by 1993, or by 
1994 at the latest, a roundtable conference made up of all the 
political parties will be held, in order to reach a minimum 
consensus on a new electoral code. The office presently in 
charge of elections says it is ready to work towards such a 
rapprochement." 
  However, in practice, instead of fostering rapprochement 
among the political parties in order to obtain this minimum 
consensus on a new electoral code, Mr. Bombet has chosen to 
draft an "electoral bill" which, on behalf of the government, he 
is about to submit to the National Assembly. Between the 
initial intent and this rehash, what could have happened? It 
would seem that there was no consultation -- most political 
party leaders that we have approached say that they do not know 
anything about such a bill. 
  The luckiest person in this situation is Professor Hubert 
Oulaye, an FPI electoral expert, who is also the chairman of the 
Independent National Electoral Commission -- a body set up by 
the FPI. Mr. Oulaye, upon reading the bill, was surprised that 
no consultations or referendum had been held, considering that 
many election results from 1990 were contested, even if no 
concrete action was taken on them. Furthermore, he added, 
"there is no country in the subregion today which went to the 
polls without going through consultations and an improvement of 
the conditions of the electoral system." In any case, Mr. 
Bombet's new electoral code is here and will surely be submitted 
to the nation's representatives for consideration. As far as we 
are concerned, we need to know what it says, in addition to its 
worth. 
  The electoral bill is comprised of 136 articles assembled 
into three sections. Right from the first section -- the common 
general provisions, and the first chapter -- the electorate -- 
we enter into what constitutes one of the major themes of the 
current political debate. Article 3 tells us that, naturally, 
Ivorian nationals are the voters, but in addition there are also 
"non-nationals from the Economic Community of West African 
States [ECOWAS], in conformity with the agreement relating to 
citizenship in the community, and shall be registered on the 
voters' list." Voting by ECOWAS nationals is presented by the 
government as an innovation in the explanatory text. Thus 
"voting is no longer, as in the past, reserved for non-Ivorians 
of African origin, but only for nationals of ECOWAS member 
countries, in conformity with the agreement...." 
  Unfortunately, a good number of jurists unanimously admit 
that the ECOWAS protocol does not confer any legal rights on 
ECOWAS citizens. The recognition of ECOWAS citizen's rights is 
left to the discretion of ECOWAS member countries but that does 
not make them legal. The protocol does not define the rights 
that ECOWAS nationals can enjoy once they are outside their own 
country, especially when they are in another ECOWAS member 
country. 
  Simply put, the citizenship referred to in the protocol has 
never been defined let alone granting any electoral rights to 
citizens. Certainly, the protocol mentions the free movement of 
persons but this does not imply the automatic granting of civic 
rights. The jurists view, coupled with the fact that only three 
countries have signed the famous protocol, shows that the 
government might need other arguments to support its action 
short of imposing its electoral code. 
  Again, Mr. Oulaye is of the view that Article 3 poses three 
kinds of problems in regard to ethics and safeguarding national 
sovereignty. First, foreigners have voted in Cote d'Ivoire from 
1960 to 1990 in violation of Article 5 of the Constitution which 
reserves voting rights exclusively for Ivorians. Our lawmakers 
who have so far passed electoral laws have done so without 
amending the Constitution. They were fully aware of the 
unconstitutionality of their action. However, they did take 
care to ensure that those electoral laws were provisional. 
Curiously, however, the new electoral law is not a provisional 
but a definite law. 
  According to Mr. Oulaye, the government does not want to 
amend the Constitution. It wants to pass a law that clearly 
violates the Constitution -- it is fully aware of the fact -- 
whereas it would be more logical to amend the Constitution or to 
adapt the new law to it. 
  From the ethical standpoint, foreigners are generally more 
exposed to pressure, manipulation, and intimidation. The fact 
that foreigners are more vulnerable psychologically paves the 
way for fraud in which some relish. What is still more serious 
is the fact that ECOWAS citizens, who may be called upon to 
vote, are not obliged to face the consequences of their 
electoral act. In the event of a tragedy -- in the extreme case 
of a civil war for example -- other countries will come and 
collect their nationals while Ivorians, who have nowhere to go, 
will at best be granted refugee status. Here lies the 
difference which is not at all a small one. 
  Another major concern that Article 3 will surely cause is 
the 
failure to indicate the duration of stay which makes an ECOWAS 
citizen eligible to vote. The ECOWAS citizen is simply being 
asked to register to vote. It is easily imagined that only one 
trip is enough for an ECOWAS citizen to qualify to vote in Cote 
d'Ivoire especially when it is common knowledge that the voters 
register is classified as a secret state document which the 
public can access only on election day. One can just imagine 
the implications. 
  Moreover, the document is full of contradictions and 
discrimination. Although an ECOWAS citizen -- even the one who 
is just passing through -- is allowed to vote, Article 5 
paragraph 1 states that "those who have acquired Ivorian 
nationality for less than five years or by marriage" do not have 
the right to vote. So, a period of five years is necessary for 
those who have the courage to apply for Ivorian citizenship and 
who are therefore prepared to fulfill their obligations and to 
face the consequences of their decision to accept this status, 
to be eligible to vote. 
  Mr. Oulaye agrees that all laws more or less fix a deadline 
for eligibility to vote which is five years in the case of Cote 
d'Ivoire, just the timeframe necessary to show one's patriotism. 
However, Mr. Oulaye does not understand why restrictions should 
be imposed on a person who wants to be Ivorian whereas nothing 
is required of a foreigner, who is just passing through Cote 
d'Ivoire and whose vote can upset our political system. 
  "Is there something in the wind?" The question needs to be 
raised because the provisions of this bill are far from 
reflecting the earlier concerns expressed by the PDCI during its 
recent conclave where it was stated, notably: "Concerning the 
issue of voting by foreigners, it is necessary to state and 
specify that naturalization at a foreigner's request and in 
conformity with preconditions that are yet to be defined, might 
be the most appropriate solution in so far as applicants have 
economic interests in our country." 
  Who stands to gain from this change in stand just a few 
months ahead of the elections? Clearly, the debate will be 
rowdy and bitter even outside the Parliament buildings where the 
bill is expected to be debated. One often forgets that Cote 
d'Ivoire is one of the few countries where nearly half of the 
population is made up of men and women who have chosen to live 
in this country without, for that matter, opting for Ivorian 
nationality. This percentage, which is far above what is termed 
the tolerance level, is problematic and requires a certain 
amount of realism that excludes demagogy, passion, and electoral 
concerns. It might be the best way of preparing the ground for 
xenophobia which will not fail to be expressed at the least 
provocation. 
  The intentions of the bill's authors appear to be even less 
clear when Articles 7 and 8 are examined. According to Article 
7, the voters register shall be unique, permanent, and 
public...and shall be placed at the disposal of all voters. 
Thus, we learn that the voters register shall be made public. 
This implies that the administration is not compelled to 
publish it. It is up to voters to go to the administration to 
consult the register, an extra effort that men and women of our 
towns and villages will be expected to make. 
  The establishment of a voters register is too serious and 
complex an issue for its sensitization aspect to be neglected, 
unless...and talking about the voters register, Interior 
Minister Bombet has officially announced the beginning of the 
revision of the voters register to prefects and mayors but it is 
only at Territorial Administration Director Ipaud Lago's office 
and at some obscure places in Abidjan that one is aware of this 
exercise, where posters (apparently) aimed at informing the 
general public, indicate how to register, where to register, who 
should register, how to check on one's registration, and so on. 
Too bad for those who do not know where to find Mr. Ipaud 
Lago's office and other chosen places. 
  Finally, looking at Article 13 of the bill which says: "The 
modalities for establishing, revising, rectifying, publishing, 
and displaying the voters register shall be determined by a 
decree issued at a cabinet meeting," everything becomes 
understandable and explainable. Thus, instead of a law 
codifying the registration and a ministerial decree taking care 
of the implementation of the exercise, it is the interior 
minister who is in charge of choosing when and how the exercise 
will be carried out. The whole bill is conceived in the same 
vein. Even provisions which would be more or less acceptable to 
everybody are immediately nullified because in the final 
analysis it is the interior minister who will issue a decree on 
its implementation. The setting up of a voters register 
commission, whose functions will be determined by ministerial 
decree is envisaged. Furthermore, a commission for the 
distribution of voters cards -- an important phase in the 
electoral process, especially in the tropics -- will be entirely 
controlled by the administration which will appoint its members 
among whom will be dignitaries (sic) but no political party 
representatives. 
  Meanwhile, all results shall be sent directly to the 
Interior 
Ministry contrary to Article 59 which states: "Each returning 
officer shall send a copy of the electoral report to the 
ministry in charge of the elections by the fastest means 
possible and through the head of the constituency under which 
his polling stations operate..." The change is certainly 
related to what happened in Kani during the 1990 presidential 
elections. In fact, that example obviously inspired the 
Interior Ministry's senior officials or perhaps it served as a 
test case at the time. The laws provide for only three 
electoral reports -- that of the Interior Ministry and two 
others exclusively reserved for the prefectural capitals and 
constituencies. 
  In short, the administration is omnipresent at all stages of 
this bill which considerably favors foreigners as far as 
eligibility and ineligibility are concerned. In fact, even if 
they can vote, they cannot be elected. Even those who opt for 
Ivorian citizenship will have to wait for 10 years. They are 
only asked one thing: to vote. Apparently, the election bill has 
been purposely worked out to suit the authority controlling the 
major sectors of the state and administration, that is the 
ruling party. 
  There is one point on which political officials may agree 
unanimously even if they fail to admit it openly. In fact, if 
the bill is passed, to contest the legislative and municipal 
elections, one would henceforth have to attach to one's 
declaration of candidacy an approval from one's party or 
political group in addition to a deposit of 200,000 CFA francs 
for those contesting the legislative elections and 10,000 CFA 
francs for those contesting the municipal elections. 
  The contents of the bill are clear. It means an end to 
independent candidates, and especially a warning to irregular 
candidates from all sides. Prospective candidates must 
henceforth deal with party headquarters which are often touchy. 
They must yield to their authority or bow out. Freedom of 
expression within political parties will thereby suffer since 
politicians will now be aware that their political future no 
longer depends on the citizens' choice but on their party organs. 
  Concerning the presidential elections, things are different. 
An independent candidate will have to pay a fixed deposit of 20 
million CFA francs and be backed by 5,000 voters, that is 500 
per region. Sometimes, there is a difference between the legal 
electoral framework and electoral practice. For that reason, 
should one neglect the contents of this framework and allow 
oneself to be guided by other concerns? 
  In addressing deputies from the rostrum of the institution 
he 
heads, Parliament speaker Charles Bauza Donwahi called for true 
democracy and open elections. Will this election bill be 
submitted to him soon to help him achieve his goal? We doubt 
it, but we dare believe that the nation's representatives will 
use common sense in making the necessary amendments to the bill.

  [Excerpt] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, has 
held discussions with a nine-member delegation from the World 
Bank at the Castle, Osu. Our Castle correspondent, Teye 
Kitcher, has the story: 
  [Kitcher] The nine members of the delegation are all 
executive directors of the World Bank and are part of the 
24-member board of the bank, its highest management body. The 
board of the World Bank is responsible for the approval of 
loans, credits, and other forms of assistance. The delegation, 
which is led by Mr. Nicholas Flanol, is on a familiarization 
tour of the country to see how the bank's assistance has been 
utilized so far, and to discuss future prospects with the 
government. It is expected that, after discussions with 
government officials on the economy, the delegation will 
appreciate Ghana's peculiar problems and be in a position to 
react favorably when requests for assistance come before the 
board of the World Bank. The delegation, which has been in 
Ghana for the past four days, has met the ministers of finance, 
education, food and agriculture, trade and industry, and mines 
and energy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Nelson Mandela's extension of the 
Indemnity Act by a year secures further immunity from 
prosecution for Cabinet members including first Deputy President 
Thabo Mbeki. 
  Mandela signed the proclamation in Umtata on Tuesday night 
which gives a further period of temporary immunity from 
prosecution for politically motivated "crimes". 
  The proclamation was published in a Government Gazette 
Extraordinary the same night after the Minister of Justice 
requested the President to extend the terms from yesterday until 
May 17 1995. 
  Returned exiles who re-entered South Africa and whose names 
appeared in three government notices published in May 1993 and 
February and March 1994 will be covered in the proclamation. 
  The previous indemnity period, authorised by former State 
President FW de Klerk, expired on Tuesday. 
  Its objective was to allow exiles who admitted to "political 
crimes" committed before October 8 1990 to return to South 
Africa to engage in constitutional negotiations. 
  First promulgated in 1990, the Act became the Further 
Indemnity Act after it was amended in 1992. 
  However, the new dispensation will not cover those who have 
committed criminal acts, whether political or not, since May 
1993.

  [Text] Almost a month after the appointment of a prime 
minister, Togo is still without a government. Prime Minister 
Edem Kodjo, who has been snubbed by his opposition friends, has 
still not been able to form his government. This situation is a 
source of concern for Togo's donors, especially, the World Bank, 
which would like the new institutions to be set up quickly 
before reviving negotiations with international institutions. 
Olabire da Cruz reports from Lome: 
  [Begin da Cruz recording] After two separate meetings with 
Prime Minister Edem Kodjo and President Eyadema on 18 and 19 
May, the World Bank executive director for Togo, Mr. Jean-Pierre 
Noboude, said that he would like to see the institutions 
established quickly in order to have specific officials to talk 
to before new agreements are signed. According to Mr. Noboude, 
this should be done by the end of this month or at the beginning 
of June at the latest so that the country can benefit from some 
20 billion CFA francs to be allocated, essentially for urban 
development and the procurement of drugs by the Health Ministry. 
  For the people, Mr. Noboude's statement seems to be an 
answer 
to its SOS call to politicians to help them deal with the 
numerous problems resulting from the protracted sociopolitical 
crisis and the recent devaluation of the CFA franc. When is the 
government going to be formed? This is the question on the lips 
of Togolese, who are increasingly worried that possible aid 
might pass them by because of the institutional void which some 
people hope will be filled within the next few days or even 
hours. [end recording]

the less fortunate in the society, and sacrifice, should serve 
as guide for all Nigerians. He said the nation needs, now more 
than ever before, Nigerians who are willing to offer sacrifice 
to ensure the survival of the nation and the revival of the 
economy. 
  Referring of the delegates election coming up on Monday [23 
May], Gen. Abacha appealed for understanding and cooperation of 
all patriots, to enable his administration lay a solid 
foundation for democracy in the country. He specifically called 
on champions of democracy not to disrupt genuine and patriotic 
steps being taken to restore democratic rule in Nigeria. 
  To those who may be planning to cause trouble during the 
delegates election, the head of state said he hopes such persons 
are aware of the consequences of such actions. He assured 
law-abiding citizens of adequate protection as they file out on 
Monday to exercise their inalienable right. He said Nigeria is 
greater than any individual, and people should not allow those 
he described as disgruntled and self-seeking individuals to 
plunge the country into chaos and anarchy.

  [Text] The Federal Government has reaffirmed that the 
resolutions taken at the proposed constitutional conference will 
be respected. The minister of information and culture, 
Professor Jerry Gana, gave the assurance yesterday while 
addressing newsmen in Kaduna. Joe Anika was there: 
  [Begin Anika recording] Prof. Gana explained that the 
conference was a forum conceived to give Nigerians the 
opportunity to decide how best to peacefully resolve our 
national problem. He said that the Federal Government would 
have no choice but to respect the outcome of the constitutional 
conference provided it would not be toward tearing the nation 
apart. The minister urged Nigerians to regard dialogue which 
the conference will offer as a better alternative to crises and 
social disorder. He, therefore, appealed to all those calling 
for a boycott of the delegates' election to have a rethink. 
Prof. Gana called on all Nigerians to come out en masse on 
Monday [23 May] and exercise their civic responsibility.

  [Text] Lagos, 20 May (PANA) -- Nigeria's military 
government has ordered the temporary closure of the country's 
multi-million dollar steel project at Ajaokuta, north-west of 
Lagos. A press release from the Ministry of Power and Steel 
made available to the Pan African news agency (PANA) said the 
project considered the largest and most ambitious of its kind in 
Africa is to be closed on Friday [20 May]. 
  The project was to make Nigeria not only self-sufficient in 
steel and its by-products but also a steel exporting country. 
The management and staff of the project as well as the public 
have been ordered to stay away from the project sites until 
further notice. 
  According to the country's power and steel minister, Wole 
Oyelese, the temporary closure is to facilitate the work of a 
panel set up recently "following a rampage by workers". The 
panel is to investigate the causes of the riot as well as 
examine the grievances of the workers and views of the 
management. It is also expected to "recommend a more feasible 
work atmosphere for the general good of the steel complex",the 
minister said. The panel joins the long list of probes set up 
by military ruler Gen Sani Abacha to probe government 
institutions, parastatals, and projects since he took power 
seven months ago.

  [Excerpts] Mohamed Farah Aidid, chairman of the executive

the United Somali Congress, USC, attended the 'Id al-Adha 
prayers with many Muslims. [passage omitted] 
  Addressing the congregation after the prayers, the chairman 
of the SNA, Mohamed Farah Aidid, prayed to Allah to accept the 
good deeds of the Muslims and unite the Muslims wherever they 
are. [passage omitted] 
  While touring the various sections of the Ministry of 
Information's headquarters, Mr. Aidid saw the destruction caused 
by UN Operation in Somalia [UNOSOM] forces to Radio Mogadishu's 
infrastructure on 12 June 1993. [passage omitted] 
  Aidid, addressing the people who attended the 'Id al-Adha 
celebrations, thanked all those who attended the various 'Id 
al-Adha parties and requested them to deliver his greetings to 
all their friends and supporters. 
  Mr. Aidid narrated the long struggle of the Somali people 
since 1943 in which the Somali people strived for justice and 
self-determination. However, this has always been spoiled by 
foreigners and their surrogates who had their own interests. 
Talking about the struggle against foreigners and recent 
meetings held in some Horn of Africa countries where ways of 
finding a solution to the Somali crisis were discussed, he said 
that from now on, as agreed, all meetings on self-determination 
for the Somali people will be held in the country. This will 
allow the Somali people to participate and to know who is 
serving their interests and who is obstructing the achievements 
of unity and progress.

airport. The Tanzania news agency, SHIHATA, said several people 
are feared dead in the accident which occurred about 1300 hours

scheduled Dar es Salaam-Mwanza-Tabora flight. SHIHATA quoted 
eyewitnesses as saying that one of the wings of the aircraft hit 
a tree as it was approaching the airport before it crashed into 
a house bursting into flames. The house used as a clinic also 
caught fire. Survivors say that the plane was also carrying two 
coffins scheduled for burial at Bukoba and Tabora respectively.

  [Text] Bodies of Rwandese dumped in Kagera after being 
killed in the ongoing civil war in their country have reached 
the shores of Lake Victoria in Mpigi District. 
  According the district medical officer Mpigi, a total of 
about 300 have have been picked from the lake shores. In a 
report to the central government representative Mpigi District, 
the district medical officer today said that a team of officials 
led by him yesterday visited Katirio, (Kitoro), and (Lubembe) 
fishing villages in Rwamahwa subcounty, where they found six 
bodies already buried and six others not yet buried. He said 
more bodies were still the water high-silt. In (Luwararo), 
(Kiwanga), and (Maziru) fish landing villages, (Ongolo), Nkozi 
subcounty, 57 corpses landed on Wednesday [18 May] and were 
buried. Yesterday, 167 corpses landed in (Luwararo), (Maziru), 
(Kiwanga), (Mayuni), and (Mluru) fish landing villages, and last 
Wednesday 60 dead bodies were reported to have been deposited by 
waves in (Mayuki) landing village. 
  The district medical officer said they also saw a number of 
dead bodies floating in the lake. The dead bodies are men, 
women, and children. Most of them are naked, and some are 
missing some parts. The international "Concern" is assisting the 
community in (Ngolo) by buying a boat at 100,000 shillings to 
collect the dead bodies. "Concern" is also paying 2000 shillings 
to bury one corpse. Medical authorities have advised the people 
in the area not to use water from the lake, and to use boiled 
water for drinking, bathing, and cleaning utensils.

  [Text] In light of the grave and dangerous situation 
created by the large numbers of dead bodies which have been 
floating in Lake Victoria from River Kagera as a result of the 
conflict in Rwanda, the Uganda Government has declared part of 
Masaka, Rakai, and Kalangala to be a disaster area. 
  The government statement issued in Kampala this morning 
says: 
The government has undertaken and will continue to carry out 
measures to combat the effect of this disaster. It says the 
extent and scope of the measures will be announced from time to 
time by the relevant organs of government. The statement said, 
Uganda Government is extremely concerned about the large numbers 
of dead bodies which have been floating in Lake Victoria from 
River Kagera as a result of the tragic conflict in Rwanda. 
  Sources estimate the number of dead bodies washed ashore 
into 
various parts of Masaka, Rakai, and Kalangala Districts to be 
around 10,000, while other sources estimate the number to be as 
high as four times that figure. The statement adds that the 
government has noted with appreciation the efforts already put 
in by various individuals and institutions such as the World 
Lutheran Federation and the U.S. Agency for International 
Development, to combat the effect of the disaster. 
  Given the magnitude of the problem however, the statement 
adds that the government wishes to appeal to the international 
community to supplement the efforts of the Ugandans in order to 
arrest the situation. The government also calls upon the 
warring factions in Rwanda to observe the fundamental rules of 
civilized conduct by giving their dead a proper burial in their 
country instead of dumping them into Kagera River. The Uganda 
Government, the statement concludes, expects that agents of the 
UN system, currently deployed in Rwanda, will impress this upon 
the authorities concerned. 
  [Dar es Salaam Radio Tanzania External Service in English at 
0400 GMT on 22 May in a similar report adds: "More than 600 
bodies of Rwandans washed into the Uganda side of Lake Victoria 
were buried in two mass graves in Uganda this week. The 
state-run daily NEW VISION reported that the dead victims of 
ethnic massacres and fighting between government troops and 
rebels in the past six weeks were buried on on 18 May at Kyebe, 
about 210 km southwest of Kampala.] 
  ["NEW VISION said authorities were still trying to drag out 
more bodies from the lake and the Kagera River which flows into 
Uganda and forms the border between Tanzania and Rwanda.] 
  ["Ugandan authorities earlier issued a warning against 
drinking unboiled water or eating fish from Lake Victoria, the 
world's largest freshwater lake."]

<F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>
  [Text] The Angolan peace talks were interrupted today at 
the request of the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA]. The leadership of the UNITA negotiating team 
will leave for Huambo tomorrow to consult with Jonas Savimbi and 
the UNITA Political Commission. 
  The consultations will center on UNITA's participation in 
the 
government at various levels, the future of the Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan] in the present news 
media structure, and the extension of the state administration, 
within the framework of national reconciliation. 
  UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim said despite the 
existence of different views on the future of Vorgan in UNITA, 
consensus has been reached and an agreeement will be concluded. 
He said it is not a matter for concern, because the government 
has not requested Vorgan's closure as it is an instrument that 
all political parties can use. The major problem now lies in 
UNITA's participation in the government at the central level. 
  UNITA says that for the past two months it has waited for a 
government reply on government posts to be given to UNITA within 
the framework of national reconciliation. UNITA is worried. 
Speaking to the news media today, Jorge Valentim said there is 
only way for these talks to go: Either the government should say 
now what posts it will give UNITA and an agreement is signed, or 
it should stay in Luanda and UNITA in Huambo. In view of of 
this stand by UNITA this morning, the special representative of 
U.S. President Bill Clinton to the talks left Lusaka this 
afternoon and is already in Luanda to contact the State 
Department from his embassy, and if necessary, the Luanda 
government. The talks will remain interrupted until 24 May.

  [Text] A peace deal for Angola is a hair's breadth away. 
We have been informed by a diplomatic source that the Lusaka 
agreement will be signed on 6 June. One thing is certain: When 
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos arrives in Portugal on 
27 June, there will already be peace on paper. At the moment, 
the only remaining point at the talks is that of national 
reconciliation and at stake are the provinces of Huambo and 
Benguela. These are two provinces which the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] does not want to 
relinquish. For the moment, the government does not want to 
give in to this UNITA demand. Both the government and UNITA are 
now trying to gain ground in the military field.

<F P=106> [From the "Last Minute" program presented by Joao Antunes] </F>
  [Text] [Words indistinct] after Washington officially 
established diplomatic relations with Luanda, the (?relations) 
between the two capitals [words indistinct]. What is more, the 
expected opening of channels and [words indistinct] very far 
from corresponding to the true expectations of the Luanda 
authorities. This evening, we asked Angolan Ambassador in 
Washington Jose Patricio what is the Angolan Government's 
assessment of relations with Washington. Did it expect more or 
did it expect less? He gave the following reply. 
  [Begin recording] [Patricio] In general, we expected more 
both at a bilateral level and in the multilateral role played by 
the United States as a mediator and as a permanent member of the 
UN Security Council. All the same, we have to recognize that 
there has been some progress. It could not do more because of 
an impeding factor, the war. 
  [Antunes] You speak of an impeding factor. There is a 
feeling, however, that the Luanda authorities expected the 
United States to be more vigorous in condemning the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Is that 
true? 
  [Patricio] We always expected the United States to adopt a 
more vigorous stand with regard to UNITA's war-mongering stand. 
It seems, however, that the U.S. administration has been having 
difficulties in playing its rightful role in the field of 
mediation and its [words indistinct] normalization of relations 
at the bilateral level. All the same, recent developments show 
that there will be greater transparency in Washington's role 
both at bilateral and multilaterlal levels. I say this, basing 
myself in the last correspondence that President Bill Clinton 
had with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. President Clinton 
has abandoned the indecision of the past where the U.S. 
administration viewed the government as simply one of the 
parties in the conflict. 
  [Antunes] Mr. ambassador, (?there are reports) that 
Washington is expected to play a more active role in peace talks 
in Lusaka [words indistinct]? 
  [Patricio] Well, there is a link between all the capitals 
which play the mediating role, that is Washington, Lisbon, and 
Moscow. It is evident that Washington, being the capital of the 
world power, has a more important role than other mediators. 
Washington also has this responsibility because it was part of 
the conflict since UNITA was an instrument of the U.S. policy. 
We should not forget this factor. [end recording]

on the right track. MPLA spokesman Norberto dos Santos has the 
details: 
  [Begin recording] [Santos] We have concluded the debates on 
the Lusaka peace talks. We have also dealt with the Cabinda 
talks. The proceedings have been adjourned but will resume on 23 
May, when we will debate the Political Bureau report to the 
Central Committee, as well as internal documents like the 
regulations. 
  [Correspondent] What have you decided on those issues? 
  [Santos] On the Lusaka talks, the Central Committee 
reiterated the principle that it is necessary to attain a fair 
and lasting peace. The Central Committee praised the 
negotiating team for giving a very detailed account of the talks 
since November 1993, thus clarifying a number of issues to 
several party officials and even the people. We have agreed 
that our negotiators have achieved very positive resultsand 
upheld the country's interests and the government's guidelines. 
So, we have encouraged the delegation to remain on track and 
achieve peace, which is of utmost importance to Angolans. 
  [Correspondent] What about Cabinda? 
  [Santos] It was decided to recommend the Political Bureau to 
look into the situation and make whatever decisions it finds 
appropriate. The session was informed on how the talks are 
progressing. [end recording]

  [Text] The residents of N'Dalatando, capital of Cuanza 
Norte Province, are still crying for their beloved relatives who 
are being killed daily by Engineer Jose Eduardo dos Santos' 
criminal aircraft. Reports from Firmino Lukamba, Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel's correspondent in that city, 
say that people are crying everywhere. 
  Yet another father, a mother, a grandfather, or son dies. 
Yesterday the Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] aircraft once again carried out 
another heavy air raid against positions on the outskirts of 
N'Dalatando. The raids were carried out by 3 Su-25 aircraft and 
5 PC-7 aircraft which dropped highly potent toxic bombs over 
villages, districts, and communes, resulting in considerable 
human and material losses. Firmino Lukamba says that the 
democratic world should persuade Luanda to stop such operations. 
He said that there is authentic genocide in N'Dalatando, and 
the international community is silent about the issue.

Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party combat 
aircraft are currently bombing the civilian population in the

N'Dalatando involves the use of chemical warfare, leaving behind 
a carpet of dead and wounded people, and destruction. The Armed 
Forces for the Liberation of Angola Military Command in the 
area, concerned with such a tremendous violation of the UN 
charter, today requested that a UN Angola Verification Mission-2 
commission be urgently sent to N'Dalatando to investigate the 
matter. An officer of that command said that a government cannot 
be allowed to massacre thousands of citizens in the name of 
democracy.

  [Text] His Excellency President Bakili Muluzi has appealed 
to all political parties and people of this country to forget 
the past and work together constructively toward the development 
of Malawi. 
  President Muluzi was speaking at the Kamuzu Stadium in 
Blantyre today after being sworn in as the first president of a 
multiparty Malawi. He said the democracy which Malawi has now 
embraced should be used constructively for the welfare of every 
Malawian. President Muluzi also stressed the need to coexist 
peacefully and to tolerate people of different political views. 
The president pledged that his government would endeavor to 
develop the available resources in the country for the 
betterment of every citizen. He said his government's 
priorities are poverty alleviation and food security. 
  In his inaugural speech President Muluzi also declared that 
he would not condone corruption and mismanagement of the 
country's resources because the country is poor. He said he 
will ensure that measures are put in place to check corruption. 
The president then promised to improve the efficiency of the 
civil service to make it more effective in discharging 
government services and enhancing the country's economic 
development. He explained that he was aware that the morale in 
the present civil service was low and promised to look into the 
issue soon. 
  Commenting on the democratization process in Malawi, 
President Muluzi said he would make sure that democracy is never 
curtailed in the country. In order to sustain this process and 
to improve human rights in the country, the president ordered 
the closure of (Mukuyu), (Nzaleka), and Nsanje prisons which, he 
said, were used to abuse human rights. He also ordered the 
release of all political prisoners and commuted death sentences 
to life imprisonment. President Muluzi also allowed human rights 
organizations to visit this country's prisons without any 
hindrance. 
  In his speech, the president declared the new state house in 
Lilongwe as the new parliament and also announced that a 
committee would be set up to dispose the country's many state 
presidencies. President Muluzi then thanked the international 
community for supporting Malawi's democratization process and 
hoped for continued assistance. He also expressed gratitude to 
churches in Malawi for the leading role they played in changing 
the country's political system and urged them to continue being 
the society's watchdogs. 
  Turning to outgoing President Ngwazi [Paramount] Dr. Kamuzu 
Banda, President Muluzi said he deserves respect and he will be 
remembered for the role he played in this country. At the 
ceremony which was attended by thousands upon thousands of 
people, Mr. Justin Malewezi was also sworn in as vice president.

  [Excerpts] Bakili Muluzi will today become the second 
president of Malawi. [passage omitted] Yesterday, Bakili Muluzi 
appointed Justin Malewezi as vice president. Mr Malewezi is a 
former senior civil servant from the Banda administration. Also 
yesterday, the future president announced his program for 
Malawi, one of the poorest countries in the world. 
  [Begin Muluzi recording, in English with superimposed French 
translation] My first concern is the poverty in this country. 
Forty-five percent of our people live in rural areas. It goes 
without saying that these are the areas where you find this 
poverty. This issue was at the forefront of my campaign, and I 
would like to say that I think we'll have to take those areas 
very very seriously. 
  I also spoke of the social services, of the health sector. 
You know that out of every 1,000 children who are born here, 
230 die before the age of five, and that's very very serious. 
  We must finally look at the education sector: 54 percent of 
our population does not know how to read, and this is a very 
high proportion. Those are my three main priorities. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Blantyre May 21 Sapa -- Fifty-one-year-old 
newly-elected Malawian President Bakili Muluzi was given a 
standing ovation on Saturday when he announced a general amnesty 
for all political prisoners, and commuted to life imprisonment 
the death sentences of ordinary prisoners. Mr Muluzi made the 
announcement in his first speech to the nation shortly after his 
presidential inauguration. The inauguration followed the 
country's first multiparty election, which stripped one of 
Africa's longest serving autocrats, Dr Kamuzu Banda, of power. 
  A crowd of 60,000 supporters packed the Kamuzu stadium to 
hear Mr Muluzi and to witness the birth of the new Malawi. They 
chanted: "Scenes have changed in Malawi." 
  The amnesty and life imprisonment sentences will take 
immediate effect. 
  Along with these measures President Muluzi also ordered 
immediate closure of the country's three notorious political 
detention camps. Amid wild applause from the crowd he said these 
camps were closely associated with the "shameful" violation of 
human rights under the rule of Dr Banda's Malawi Congress Party. 
  The president also invited all international human rights 
organisations to Malawi, saying: "They are free to visit this 
country and inspect our prisons as they wish." 
  Mr Muluzi said the 300 million kwacha State House built by 
Dr 
Banda in Lilongwe should be turned into a parliamentary chamber. 
  He said Malawi could not afford the luxury of having state 
residences in each of the country's 24 districts. A committee 
would be set up to work towards disposing of all the unwanted 
state residences. 
  Mr Muluzi said the day was a special and memorable occasion 
which would be cherished forever as the moment that ushered real 
change into Malawi. "We have earned our freedom from the 
autocratic ruler who oppressed us and pounced on our rights 
ruthlessly." 
  He pledged to uphold the principle of genuine democracy and 
to work for the betterment of all the people irrespective of 
their tribal, political, or ethnic differences. 
  It is expected Mr Muluzi, whose party won 84 of the 177 
parliamentary seats, will now need to form a coalition 
government with the Alliance for Democracy, headed by Mr 
Chakufwa Chihana, 55. He has already chosen former civil servant 
Justin Malewezi, who was booted out as secretary to the 
president and cabinet during Dr Banda's regime, as 
vice-president. The choice apparently dashed the expectations of 
many Malawians, who hoped this position would go to Mr Chihana 
in a bid to bring about national unity. 
  Results of the general election have clearly shown that 
Malawi is a divided nation, desperately in need of someone who 
can unite it.

  [Text] The Electoral Commission has released the national 
results of the parliamentary and presidential elections. 
Announcing these in a press release, the Electoral Commission 
said in the presidential race, the final results are as follows: 
Mr. Bakili Muluzi, 1,404,754 votes; Dr. Kamuzu Banda, 996,363; 
Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, 552,862 votes; Mr. Kampelo Kaluwa, 
15,624. 
  In the parliamentary election the distribution of seats is 
84 
seats for UDF [United Democratic Front]; 65 seats for MCP 
[Malawi Congress Party] and 36 seats for Aford [Alliance for 
Democracy]; the rest of the contesting parties did not win a 
single seat. The Electoral Commission has also nullified the 
results in two constituencies in Nsanje, namely, Nsanje north 
and Nsanje southwest. This follows the commission's 
investigation of complaints of irregularities in these 
constituencies. The commission discovered that at one station 
figures kept by all monitors did not agree with the official 
figure and that some important documents like ballot paper 
counterfoils, original forms for results, were missing. 
  In another station, the ballot papers used during the 
elections were missing. The elections in the two constituencies 
will be rerun. The Electoral Commission will announce details 
of the by-elections later.

  [Text] The Malawi Congress Party, MCP, has expressed 
concern of the misdemeanor by UDF [United Democratic Front] 
supporters in some parts of the country, whom, it said, were 
harassing or committing violent acts against its supporters as 
they celebrated their party's victory. 
  In a statement issued in Lilongwe, spokesman for the MCP 
said 
in the capital city UDF supporters carried a mock coffin of His 
Excellency President Ngwazi [paramount] Dr. Kamuzu Banda, while 
six houses of MCP supporters have been destroyed in Balaka. The 
spokesman said a house belonging to an MCP functionary was 
stoned in Blantyre, while some village headmen and chiefs have 
been threatened with burning of their houses and dethronement in 
Nsanje, (Jaturu), and other districts in the southern region. 
  The spokesman said such acts and threats were unwarranted 
and 
called on the president-elect to put an immediate end to them. 
He said the MCP would hold the UDF and its leaders responsible 
for any damage to property and harm to the MCP supporters. The 
spokesman, however, reassured all MCP supporters not to feel 
intimidated by anyone because, he said, they are equally 
protected by the law and Constitution of this country.

  [Excerpts] The Alliance for Democracy, Aford, has today 
congratulated the president-elect, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, for 
winning the presidential vote, and wished him success in his new 
position. 
  The president of Aford, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, spoke to 
reporter (Francis Chicucuzeni) today, saying he was concerned 
about the regional fragmentation of this country in the 
elections. 
  [Begin Chihana recording] You are bringing a technical 
issue. I am concerned, I am worried that the country has been 
fragmented. Let me be very ordinary with you -- I was rather 
technical. Say, he has been voted overwhelmingly by the people 
of the south, southern region. And it seems the MCP [Malawi 
Congress Party] are holding the (?differential), and to my 
disappointment the people of the north have voted for AFORD. It 
will require a political acumen, leadership which is [word 
indistinct] to make sure that the country is back on track as a 
solely united country. Regardless of these factors which have 
been created by the result of the election, if I were Bakili I 
would definitely call on the MCP, the Alliance for Democracy for 
a get-together meeting to discuss this problem first before 
going to [word indistinct] [passage omitted]. 
  [(Chicucuzeni)] And what is your message now to the 
supporters of AFORD? 
  [Chihana] The supporters of AFORD, they must not worry. The 
country has chosen Bakili Muluzi as the next president in a 
democratic Malawi. I and my colleagues wish him all the best 
and we'll definitely support him. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The victory of Bakili Muluzi and the United 
Democratic Front [UDF] in Malawi's elections has closed the book 
on 30 years of rule by Dr. Hastings Banda and the Malawi 
Congress Party [MCP]. In that time, Dr. Banda ruled Malawi with 
an iron grip, but he led the MCP in Tuesday's elections as their 
presidential candidate. Well now, the MCP must be holding 
postmortems to consider what went wrong for them at the polls. 
On the line to Lilongwe, Robin White spoke to Dr. Heatherwick 
Ntaba, the foreign minister of the outgoing MCP government, and 
asked him if he thought they had chosen the wrong presidential 
candidate. 
  [Begin recording] [Ntaba] No, I don't think so. That is 
completely out of the question. I don't think we had the wrong 
presidential candidate at all. 
  [White] Do you think that the truth might be that the 
electorate judged you on your record and they didn't like your 
record? 
  [Ntaba] No, I think that is speculation. I might just say at 
this point that if you look at the pattern of the results, they 
are completely regional. That is a matter of great concern to 
us. We no longer seem to have a national political movement any 
more. According to these results, the country seems to have 
fragmented into regions politically and I think we need to very 
carefully look at what happened and see how we can correct the 
trend to regionalize the country politically. This is our major 
concern, as well as being disappointed with the results at the 
moment. 
  [White] You yourself won your seat, I understand? 
  [Ntaba] I won my own seat very comfortably, yes. 
  [White] So, you will be now sitting on the opposition seat? 
  [Ntaba] Well, that is the reality. This is what the result 
of the elections mean. I have no serious reservations about 
serving this country politically or contributing to the 
political development of this country from the opposition. I 
believe the country, in the new democratic dispensation, needs a 
strong, solid, and very responsible opposition. I am ready and 
willing to serve in that capacity because that seems to be what 
the electorate wants. 
  [White] But it must be very hard to surrender power? 
  [Ntaba] As hard as naturally it can be for any human being, 
but nevertheless these are the realities of democratic 
elections, of political competition these days. It is not any 
more difficult for me to accept that than it would be for a 
politician in any other part of the world, I must assure you. 
But we, in the Malawi Congress Party, have adapted ourselves to 
the changed political climate. That is why we have had no 
problems issuing these concession statements from our leader, a 
thing which would have been completely different and has been 
different in many countries of the African continent. 
  [White] Have discussions already started with Mr. Muluzi to 
ensure that there is a smooth hand over of power? 
  [Ntaba] The UDF government or the UDF leadership have not 
yet 
approached us formally to discuss with us about the handing over 
of power and I am not sure how that is normally done. This is 
the first time we have had such an election in this country, as 
you know. I don't know who speaks to who first, but I suppose 
we all learn together on how power is handed over after a 
democratic election that has been considered free and fair by 
many observers. 
  [White] But in technical terms, are you still a minister or 
is somebody else a minister? 
  [Ntaba] I suppose you would have to say I am still a 
minister 
of foreign affairs because I have not heard an announcement from 
the president-elect yet of who his foreign minister is going to 
be. 
  [White] And when will the formal hand over take place? 
  [Ntaba] The president-elect is being sworn-in tomorrow and I 
suppose that marks the formal handing over of the power of 
government and I would assume that that would mark the formal 
handing over of the government. 
  [White] What is going to happen to President Banda? 
  [Ntaba] In what stance? He is simply not going to be 
involved in politics any more. He is not going to be involved 
in running the affairs of this country as head of state. He 
will certainly be retiring at some other place that he will 
choose and I can probably not tell you any more than that. 
  [White] Now, what about all his houses and palaces that he 
has had? Do you think he will be allowed to live in one of 
those? 
  [Ntaba] Well, he has a number of residences of his own, 
personally, which are quite suitable, quite comfortable. It is 
not a question of him being allowed to occupy one of those 
stately residences which he owns personally. 
  [White] What about the Sanjika Palace? Do you think it would 
be a good gesture of the government to allow him to stay there? 
  [Ntaba] That would indeed be a question for the 
president-elect, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, to answer and not mine. I 
would want you, I would you hope that you could put that 
question to him when you have a chance and see how he can answer 
it. 
  [White] But do you personally think that that would be a 
good 
idea? 
  [Ntaba] If I were in that position, I would certainly think 
it would be a good idea. I think a person of that caliber, a 
person who has ruled this country, politically stable for 31 
years, deserves a gesture of that nature. 
  [White] Do you have any complaints at all about the way the 
UDF, the winners, have behaved so far in victory? 
  [Ntaba] Yes, certainly. You recall that our leader conceded 
very gracefully yesterday and appealed to Malawians to behave 
like Malawians. He appealed to the winners to celebrate with 
understanding and without vengeance. We are very, very 
disappointed to see that the UDF supporters are committing acts 
of violence against the Malawi Congress Party supporters. They 
have destroyed six houses in Machinga district, in Balaka area. 
This is the president's-elect home district. They have 
destroyed six houses of the MCP supporters. In Blantyre, they 
have destroyed a house of one of the MCP lady supporters, for no 
other offense, but for being a vice district chairman for women 
in that area. We are also getting chiefs in the Lower Chire 
being harassed and being intimidated. All these acts are going 
on and we are not hearing any appeal from the president-elect to 
restrain his supporters or to have UDF supporters act in a 
restrained manner. So, we are very, very disappointed at what 
is happening from the UDF camp. [end recording]

  [Text] Kinshasa, 20 May (AFP) -- The Rwandan ambassador to 
Zaire today criticized the way current events in his country are 
portrayed by the international media, which he accuses of "being 
oddly indulgent toward the rebels." 
  Mr. Etienne Sengegera stated in a communique that the media, 
"manipulated and/or misinformed by supporters and sponsors of 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front -- rebels from the Tutsi minority 
group -- have remained silent over the numerous atrocities that 
these rebels, who have moved up the ladder working alongside 
Ugandan President Museveni -- a former underground leader -- 
have committed as they wage their dirty war in Rwanda." 
  Furthermore, Mr. Sengegera said "President Museveni's 
proteges lose no time in burying their victims in mass graves. 
They take care to photograph and film them for their pernicious 
propaganda, with the aim of deceiving the international 
community by presenting the Hutus thus massacred as Tutsis who 
are the victims of a so-called genocide."

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, May 21 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels pushed 
on Saturday [21 May] with a violent offensive against government 
forces in the capital Kigali where shelling was particularly 
fierce around the airport, a spokesman for the UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) said. 
  Abdul Kabia, contacted by telephone, said the rebels from 
the 
Tutsi-dominaed Rwandan Patriotic Front held the advantage in the 
latest fighting. But he was reluctant to say if this "major 
offensive" was the final push the rebels have vowed to make 
against the Hutu-dominated government forces to take Kigali. 
"We are uncertain exactly what their strategy is," said Kabia. 
  Though fighting died down somewhat during the morning, it 
forced the United Nations to cancel a flight from Nairobi that 
was to try to get into Kigali Saturday. The fighting has kept 
the airport closed for three days running, blocking UN attempts 
to fly in desperately needed food and medicine. 
  The airport is Kigali's only lifeline, but for the RPF it is 
a military target because one of the army's biggest military 
camps, Camp Kanombe, runs alongside the runways. 
  Kabia said shells fell on the airport's arrival terminal and 
near the control tower Saturday. Though they caused no injuries 
among UNAMIR forces deployed at the facility, six UN vehicles 
were destroyed. 
  Shells also fell inside the Rwandan capital, some near the 
Hotel Diplomate and Kigali's hospital, where 30 patients were 
killed in their beds in shelling on Thursday. 
  There were no immediate reports of new casualties on 
Saturday. 
  Special UN envoy Iqbal Riza of Pakistan was expected in 
Kigali this weekend to seek the cooperation of both sides with 
the Security Council's decision to send 5,500 peacekeepers to 
Rwanda. 
  Kabia said government forces had set up camp in "defensive 
positions" near Gitarama, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of 
the capital, where the rebels are thought to be preparing a vast 
offensive. Gitarama is where the interim government opposed by 
the rebels holed up after fleeing the capital when the country 
slipped back into civil war last month, ending an 
eight-month-old truce that had brought UN troops into the 
country to help prepare for elections. [passage omitted] 
  In Geneva, an International Committee of the Red Cross said 
Friday that "hundreds of thousands" of people were fleeing 
central Rwanda amid the upsurge of fighting in Kigali and 
elsewhere, many milling around the Gitarama region. 
  At least two million of the country's seven million 
population have been made homeless and are threatened by 
epidemics, according to the World Health Organisation.

  [Excerpt] The Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] continues to 
score points. The international airport at Kanombe near Kigali 
and the Kanombe camp of Colonel (Mayuya) are under the total 
control of the RPA, the armed wing of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF], as of this morning. Under siege for several days, 
the Col. (Mayuya) camp finally fell today to the combatants of 
the RPA. Many soldiers left their [word indistinct] behind. 
Enormous quantities of arms were seized. Government troops who 
fled the onslaught of the Inkotanyi [rebels] did not have time 
to take their arms and ammunition. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Rwandan rebels have scored an impressive 
victory in their battle with government forces for the control 
of the capital, Kigali. This morning, a major Army stronghold 
at Kanombe, east of the airport, fell to the rebels, and the 
strategically important airport was, itself, also captured. 
According to the rebels, this is all part of an offensive 
started last month directed at preventing the slaughtering of 
civilians by government militias. On a satellite phone to rebel 
headquarters in Kigali, Raggi Omar asked RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] military spokesman, Emmanuel Ndahiro how they captured 
the airport. 
  [Begin recording] [Ndahiro] Yes, last night there was heavy 
fighting, and the troops were in contact this time. That had 
been preceded by heavy shelling the previous day, and they 
eventually managed to unhand the resistance of the enemy and 
captured the airport and the barracks that is just next to the 
runway, a Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for 
Democracy and Development militias] military base which has been 
the most powerful around in the country made up of the elite. 
So, we are in control of the airport, and we took charge of 
that barracks, yes. 
  [Omar] This is Kanombe Camp, which is where the Rwandan 
Government Army forces are? 
  [Ndahiro] Yes, that is the military barracks I am talking 
about. We took control of it and we are in charge. We were in 
that barracks. We managed to push the government forces really 
far so we are in total control of the barracks and the airport. 
  [Omar] Why has the RPF decided to move militarily on Kigali 
Airport at this specific juncture? 
  [Ndahiro] There has not been anything new, if I may inform 
you. You must have heard that all along we had been fighting 
around the airport. There has been a very strong government 
position around the airport and that military barracks. We had 
requested that the airport become a neutral point, and the UN 
could not manage to make it a neutral point. They allowed the 
government forces to stay around and near the airport, which did 
not make it a neutral point. We suggested that us too should be 
around the airport so that it is manned by all the parties in 
the conflict. The government forces denied that, I mean, they 
refused, and the UN forces could not enforce it, so in the end 
they were there at their own [word indistinct]. There were 
certainly hindering in so far as the situation demanded in 
neutrality. The United Nations from the very beginning lacked 
the backbone to stand and oppose the government forces from 
killing the people they were killing so we could not leave it 
into their hands alone. 
  [Omar] Will the RPF afford the United Nations full 
cooperation in having access to the airport and in getting aid 
and humanitarian flights into Kigali Airport? 
  [Ndahiro] Yes, we shall offer full cooperation with the 
United Nations in its endeavor to support the remaining few 
people with humanitarian assistance. 
  [Omar] Will you also afford them also full assistance in 
deploying their new 5,500 peacekeepers which they envisage doing 
in the next week or so? 
  [Ndahiro] Of course, that brings back the question that we 
tried to advise whoever was responsible for taking that decision 
on numbers, particularly. We said the number was too large for 
this mission and we are still critical about it, but we feel 
2,500 men are perhaps not necessary at the airport. We can go 
into discussions about numbers that are necessary and are up to 
the job that we think they will be doing at the airport, yes. 
  [Omar] So you are saying that 5,500 new UN peacekeepers is 
too much. They only really need 2,500 to do the job in your 
eyes? 
  [Ndahiro] Yes, that is what we see in so far as the 
so-called 
humanitarian that has come to the...[pauses] Yes, we feel that 
force is capable of delivering. 
  [Omar] So now that RPF has control of the airport will you 
just allow the UN to bring 2,500 in and then say: Well, that is 
all we think that you will need and we will not allow you to 
bring in the remaining 3,000. 
  [Ndahiro] I told you we were very flexible. We are very 
flexible; we are ready to discuss with the people that are 
concerned. The resolution to have 5,500 men was taken with no 
regard to our suggestions. We are more on the ground and we 
feel better equipped to advise on what is best here. [end

  [Text] Our guest today on Afrique Midi is General Augustin 
Bizimungu, the Rwandan Government Army chief of staff. As you 
probably know, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has just taken 
control of Kigali airport, which had been at the center of 
fierce fighting for several days. Gen. Bizimungu does not give 
the same version of events as the RPF. Here is Augustin 
Bizimungu's version given to Dominique de Courcelles: 
  [Begin recording] [Bizimungu] The airport, we, the UN force 
requested control of the airport from the Rwandan Government to 
carry out humanitarian actions. We granted the neutrality of 
the airport. 
  [Courcelles] Since you granted that neutrality, it appears 
that there was fierce fighting last night and that the RPF 
managed to seize control of the airport. 
  [Bizimungu] No, let us say that we left, it was a preamble 
to 
remove our troops from the airport. I do not know if the RPF 
occupied it, it should have been under UNAMIR's [UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda] control. 
  [Courcelles] Have you yourself pulled out all your troops 
from the airport? 
  [Bizimungu] Yes. 
  [Courcelles] Last night? 
  [Bizimungu] Yes. 
  [Courcelles] Where did you pull them back to? 
  [Bizimungu] To the town center. 
  [Courcelles] However there was fierce fighting at the 
airport 
last night. 
  [Bizimungu] No. Fighting took place, it was extremely fierce 
in the past three days, and it intensified in the last two days. 
I believe that there is no more fighting now because it is 
supposed to be under UNAMIR's control. 
  [Courcelles] You are saying that you voluntarily pulled out 
your soldiers from the airport to hand over the airport to 
UNAMIR, therefore the airport did not fall under the RPF's 
control. 
  [Bizimungu] I do not know for sure now. The best might be to 
ask the UN mission if it is still controlling the airport or if 
the RPF, which was very close, 500 meters away, occupied it when 
we left. 
  [Courcelles] What is the situation regarding the Kanombe 
camp, which is very close to the airport runways and which is 
one of the targets of the RPF? 
  [Bizimungu] The camp is next to the airport. To control the 
camp it was necessary to control the airport. 
  [Courcelles] So you also evacuated the camp? 
  [Bizimungu] Yes, we did. 
  [Courcelles] Where to? Kigali? 
  [Bizimungu] Yes. We adopted a new defensive plan by 
supporting ourselves on a part near the airport. [sentence as 
heard] Therefore we control part of the town and we adopted a 
new plan. 
  [Courcelles] Were there many casualties during last night's 
fighting around the camp? 
  [Bizimungu] No. Not last night, but I told you that there 
was fierce fighting in this area for the past four or five days. 
Naturally there are always casualties when there is fighting. 
  [Courcelles] Now general, what are your plans? 
  [Bizimungu] My plans? We are reorganizing and the fighting 
continues. 
  [Courcelles] Will the battle for Kigali start now? 
  [Bizimungu] I believe so since when we occupied a position 
and when we defended it we were expecting to be attacked. I am 
not sure if the RPF will not continue its' attacks. If it does 
so, fighting will continue. 
  [Courcelles] Are you rather on the defensive? 
  [Bizimungu] In the town itself, yes. 
  [Courcelles] Elsewhere? 
  [Bizimungu] In the north, near Ruhengeri, the Rwandan Armed 
Forces have the upper hand. We intend to resume the offensive 
there. In the south, near Buyefera, our troops retreated two 
weeks ago, they are now reorganizing and we also expect to go on 
the offensive there too. 
  [Courcelles] What can you tell us regarding the overall 
situation? Do you feel that you are on the retreat, or more or 
less holding? How do you assess the situation? 
  [Bizimungu] We are not on the retreat yet. Let us say that 
the situation is complex for the time being, but it is not 
hopeless. We lose a battle here, we win one there. Let us say 
that we are not in a desperate situation. 
  [Courcelles] Are talks with the RPF for a cease-fire 
possible? Do you wish them? 
  [Bizimungu] We always hoped for an end to the fighting 
because we remain convinced that war will not solve the problems 
of the Rwandans. [end recording]

  [Text] Nairobi, May 22 (AFP) - The mostly Tutsi Rwandan 
Patriotic Front (RPF) Sunday [22 May] seized the government-held 
Camp Kanombe barracks near Kigali airport which they had 
captured earlier in the day, UN officials announced. 
  Hundreds of people fled the camp after the rebels had taken 
the airport following days of intense shelling. The barracks 
accommodated up to 4,000 government troops until recently and 
were the biggest in the Rwandan capital, according to a UN 
estimate. 
  UN spokesman Abdul Kabia earlier announced by telephone in 
Rwanda that the airport, where 200 Ghanaian UN troops are 
stationed, fell to the RPF at about 6.00 a.m. (0400 GMT) with no 
casualties reported. 
  "The RPF soldiers are everywhere, in the buildings, on the 
runway," one military source said.

  [Text] The UN secretary general's special representative to 
Rwanda, Dr. Jacques Roger Booh-Booh, has been told to move from 
Rwanda to Nairobi, Kenya. The instructions have been given by 
the UN secretary general, Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF] has been calling for the withdrawal of Dr. 
Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh from Rwanda because Dr. Booh-Booh has 
been biased against the RPF. While attempting to implement the 
Arusha peace agreement, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh fought very 
hard to include the CDR [pro-Habyarimana's Coalition for the 
Defense of the Republic] into the broad-based transitional 
national assembly. 
  CDR is a political party of extremists which violated the 
Arusha peace agreement immediately after the agreement had been 
signed. Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh has also participated in the 
setting up of the current illegitimate government in Rwanda, a 
government of extremists which is behind the massacres that have 
been going on in Rwanda. Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh was so 
close to the extremist political group of President Habyarimana 
to the extent that Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh compromised his 
role as a mediator between the RPF and the Rwandan Government. 
  The RPF has said that it will not cooperate in any UN 
activities in Rwanda until Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh is 
withdrawn.

  [Excerpts] In Rwanda the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] today took control first of the airport in Kigali 
and then of the Kanombe barracks, where the government army was 
holed up. [passage omitted] 
  Our correspondent Nicolas Poincare has been accompanying the 
RPF troops for several days as they advance on Kigali. He sends 
his first report this evening on the particularly tragic 
situation in Rwanda: 
  [Poincare] [passage omitted] The RPF, scenting victory, will 
not hear of a cease-fire, nor of the arrival of fresh UN troops. 
Dr Emile Roua Massirabo, deputy chairman of the RPF, explains 
that the arrival of UN troops would mean the preservation of the 
status quo, and hence continuing massacres in the areas held by 
the regular army. He said so yesterday in his headquarters in 
Kibungo: 
  [Begin Massirabo recording] When they ask for such an 
intervention force, we have the feeling that on the one hand, 
they are telling us to stop pursuing the killers, and on the 
other, they (?will not) be able to stop the massacres, and they 
will be given a free hand to continue their vile work. [end 
recording] 
  [Poincare] The UN troops can only look on impotently at this 
success. They cannot even use the airport any more. Nicolas 
Poincare, France Inter, Kibungo, Rwanda.

  [Text] In Rwanda a possible cease-fire has been announced 
by sources close to the United Nations. The government army 
reportedly accepted this 60-hour truce planned to start at 0600 
GMT tomorrow. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has clearly 
stated that it does not intend to respect this cease-fire. 
Let's listen to Jacques Bihozagara, a member of the RPF 
executive committee who was appointed deputy president in the 
Arusha agreement: 
  [Begin recording] [Bihozagara] For us it is unacceptable to 
sign a cease-fire; however, if they want to surrender we are 
ready to consider the proposal. If they want a cease-fire they 
must first stop the massacre of civilians. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What about the neutrality of 
the 
airport which the UN Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] has attempted to 
negotiate for several days? What will your answer be, now that 
you are in control of the airport? 
  [Bihozagara] Now that we control the airport, it is out of 
the question to negotiate its neutrality; it is rather a matter 
of asking how planes can land and take off, that's all. 
  [Correspondent] Will you differentiate between planes flying 
in humanitarian aid and those flying in UN soldiers? 
  [Bihozagara] Obviously, because we expressed our support for 
humanitarian aid and we are ready to consider the UNAMIR request 
concerning humanitarian issues. 
  [Correspondent] What about the arrival of UN reinforcements? 
  [Bihozagara] Concerning the arrival of reinforcements, I say 
that if we have accepted the principle of the UN resolution we 
have not yet discussed their deployment. We are expecting the 
United Nations to give us details concerning their mission, 
their composition and the deployment of these forces before they 
arrive. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jacques Bihozagara, member of the </F>
Rwandan Patriotic Front Political Bureau, by Dominique de 
Courcelles on 23 May, place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Fierce exchanges of fire broke out early this 
morning in certain districts of Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, 
according to a Reuter report we have just received. [passage 
omitted] In theory, a cease-fire -- or rather a truce -- should 
have started in Kigali half an hour ago, at 0800 local time, at 
the initiative of the United Nations. [passage omitted] Here is 
one of the main officials of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, whom 
Dominique de Courcelles has just contacted in Geneva. He is 
Jacques Bihozagara, member of the political bureau of the 
organization: 
  [Bihozagara] I think we have to make a distinction between a 
truce and a cease-fire. We have never refused a truce for a 
specific action, for example consultations between the United 
Nations and the forces on the ground. 
  As for a cease-fire, we are saying that first you have to 
get 
a cease-fire between those who are butchering the people and the 
people themselves, but there is no question of speaking of a 
cease- fire between the fighters of the Patriotic Front and this 
routed army. 
  [De Courcelles] So after the truce we should expect the 
fighting to begin again? 
  [Bihozagara] Of course. 
  [De Courcelles] So this truce is to get an explanation of 
the 
UN mandate, because a priori you rather tend to be against a 
reinforcement of the UN troops? 
  [Bihozagara] You know, we are not formally against it, but 
we 
weren't there when the UN Security Council resolution was 
adopted in New York, so we are expecting further clarifications 
from the United Nations about its make-up, its deployment, and 
its numbers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nairobi, May 23 (AFP) -- Government troops and 
rebels fought throughout the night with heavy weapons around a 
gendarmerie base in Kigali and the camp of the Presidential 
Guard, but the guns fell silent just before 9:00 a.m. (0700 GMT) 
Monday [23 May], UN spokesman Abdul Kabia reported from the 
Rwandan capital. 
  That was shortly after a ceasefire had been due to come into 
effect at 8:00 a.m. 
  Journalists who visited the site meanwhile said they saw the 
bodies of 15 soldiers of the mainly Hutu government army and 25 
civilians killed during a four-day battle for Kigali airport and 
an adjoining government army base which the mainly Tutsi troops 
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front overran Sunday. 
  The warring parties agreed to a two-day ceasefire during the 
visit of Iqbal Riza, a special envoy of UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who is due to discuss increasing the UN 
troop strength in the small central African nation from 400 to 
5,500. 
  He was due to arrive later Monday by road from Uganda.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 21 SAPA -- Lawyers for Winnie 
Mandela have warned her former friend and co-accused in the 
Stompie Seipei affair, Xoliswa Falati, to stop spreading new 
allegations about the deputy minister of arts, culture, science 
and technology. "You have caused, since your release in March 
from jail, to be published various newspaper articles containing 
false, defamatory and actionable allegations which clearly seek 
to undermine Mrs Mandela," her attorney Templeton Mageza said in 
a recent letter to Ms Falati. 
  CITY PRESS Editor Khulu Sibiya told SAPA on Saturday Ms 
Falati had informed his Sunday newspaper that she would hold an 
international press conference on Tuesday to disclose what she 
called more information about Mrs Mandela's part in atrocities. 
He quoted her as saying she was living in fear of her life and 
would not be cowed down by threats of legal action. 
  Mr Mageza said he had affidavits of people testifying to Ms 
Falati's allegations. "This letter serves to warn you that Mrs 
Mandela will not allow you to persist in your conduct." 
  On the planned international press conference, he told Ms 
Falati: "We are instructed to immediately proceed and approach 
the Supreme Court for the necessary relief. To avoid this 
drastic step we would advise that you furnish our offices by no 
later than noon on Monday, May 23, with an undertaking in 
writing that you will desist from further insulting, undermining 
and defaming of our client and that no such further publications 
shall be made by you and further that you will call no such 
press conference." 
  Mr Mageza stressed he was not trying to restrict anyone's 
freedom of speech, but said publications printing Ms Falati's 
allegations should verify them first. Mrs Mandela and Ms 
Falati, who were convicted in the trial of the kidnapping and 
murder of teenager Stompie Seipei, were respectively fined 
15,000 rand and imprisoned.

<F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Text] The government plans to sell off state assets, 
including property owned abroad, to fund its reconstruction and 
development programme, Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo 
said this week. "I am keen to ensure that assets that are not 
directly linked to the delivery of the reconstruction and 
development programme, that are merely a symbol of the white 
glory macho projects of the past, are sold. I have absolutely 
no reservations about that," Mr Naidoo said in an interview. 
  These funding "windfalls", Mr Naidoo said, could include 
power stations that had been mothballed, and embassies abroad. 
"We are reviewing all our assets," he said. The government 
would also have to assess all its properties abroad. Properties 
that could go first were those owned by the former TBVC 
[Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states. 
  He would also support moving away from holding on to 
embassies that were more the style of Western countries and not 
in line with a developing Third World country like South Africa. 
"We don't have to live the lifestyles of First World Western 
countries. We are a developing country and we must relate to 
that reality and first strive towards a sustainable economy," he 
said. 
  Mr Naidoo said there were four other sources of funding for 
the reconstruction and development programme. These were slices 
from the Budget, which would increase year by year. One of the 
scenarios put forward by the National Institute for Economic 
Policy was that by the end of five years, this would have 
totalled R[Rand]80- billion, with R39-billion being spent in the 
fifth year. Other sources of funding were development aid from 
foreign donors, and contributions from the private sector and 
non-governmental organisations.

<F P=106> [Article by Jimmy Seepe] </F>
  [Text] The Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] is now prepared to 
serve in the cabinet of national unity despite the 
organisation's earlier refusal to do so, said one of its 
parliamentary representatives this week. 
  But according to PAC chief negotiator, Gora Ibrahim, the 
interim constitution will have to be amended by parliament since 
it only entitles parties that gained a minimum of five percent 
of the votes to have a cabinet position. 
  Ibrahim told NEW NATION of how PAC sees its future role in 
parliament and how it plans to work within the system. 
  On president Nelson Mandela's overtures to try to give 
recognition to the role liberation movements had played, Ibrahim 
said he did not know how Mandela planned to do that. 
  Ibrahim, however, said negotiations were continuing with 
Mandela on the type of role and positions that the PAC could be 
expected to hope for in government. 
  "We appreciate the president's gesture to accommodate the 
PAC 
in the cabinet," he said. "But I do not know of any position 
that had been left for us." 
  It has been suggested that the president was trying to 
provide the PAC with an important post in the government besides 
a cabinet position. It has also been mooted that Mandela might 
even give the organisation one of the positions that belong to 
the ANC. 
  "While the PAC appreciates the gestures made by Mandela 
there 
are constitutional issues that have to be resolved," said 
Ibrahim. 
  "Our participation in the cabinet would be illegal if the 
constitution was not amended," he said. 
  Ibrahim said his organisation cannot force changes to the 
constitution since its voice had been weakened by the percentage 
votes it received from the electorate. 
  He said the PAC's role in parliament would be guided by 
concern for the aspirations of the people such as land, housing, 
employment, education and health. 
  "We will not oppose everything that comes before 
parliament," 
Ibrahim said. "We will not oppose measures that will improve 
the lot of the majority." 
  On the future of the Azanian People's Liberation Army 
(APLA), 
he said APLA commanders were negotiating about the future of the 
force but could not spell out when and where they would assembly 
them for integration into the South African National Defence 
Force (SANDF). 
  He also could not say how many of APLA cadres would be 
involved. 
  Ibrahim said he hoped that APLA's participation would not be 
prejudiced by the percentage of votes the organisation had 
achieved in the elections "since a new army should not represent 
the wishes of political parties but the interests of the nation". 
  "Integration should be determined on merit and 
qualifications," he said. "I think APLA would be able to meet 
all those." 
  Before the elections, PAC supported wildcat strikes by civil 
servants in the former homelands but Ibrahim admitted to NEW 
NATION that the strikes were "premature". 
  "They (North-West provincial parliament) have been there for 
less than a week," he said, "but their grievances will have to 
be addressed sometime." 
  But Ibrahim predicted that the ANC government would be faced 
with immense problems trying to control strikes arising from 
expectations raised during the election campaigns. He cited 
housing as an example. "There is no way that enough housing can 
be provided in the foreseeable future -- for more than 
eight-million people living in shacks and squalid areas," he 
said.

<F P=106> [By Paul Stober] </F>
  [Text] The National Intelligence Service [NIS] will emerge 
virtually unscathed from a planned shake-up of South Africa's 
secret services, and is set to become the country's chief 
information- gathering agency. Intelligence sources and 
military analysts this week confirmed that the NIS will be 
responsible for the collection and analysis of all strategic 
intelligence -- inside and outside South Africa -- under the new 
government. But there is still heated debate about the agency's 
legal powers, such as the right to arrest. 
  NIS operatives, confident about a bright future under the 
new 
government, are referring to their organisation as the "Mo, Joe 
and Louw show" -- referring to the ANC intelligence's number 
two, Mo Sheik; his chief, Joe Nhlanhla; and the present chief of 
the NIS, Mike Louw. It is not yet clear who will emerge at the 
head of the agency. 
  To date, South Africa's three major intelligence services -- 
Military Intelligence (MI), the Crime Intelligence Service 
(formerly the security police) and the NIS -- have operated with 
scant regard for each other's jurisdictions. 
  Under the new guidelines, the NIS will obtain the 
information 
necessary to identify threats to national security and then 
instruct the other agencies to monitor those people or parties 
regarded as dangerous. 
  Commenting on the emergence of the NIS as the top dog, the 
Centre for Conflict Resolution's Laurie Nathan said: "The NIS 
has had a more positive role than the other intelligence 
agencies in preparing for the transition. It is appropriate in 
a democracy that the premier intelligence agency, responsible 
for strategic national intelligence, is a civilian agency, 
rather than police or military intelligence." 
  Although the NIS has been traditionally regarded as more of 
an academic think-tank than an intelligence agency, sources who 
have worked with it say it has an impressive 
information-collection capacity and an impressive ability to 
make sense of the data. 
  Key to the survival of the NIS is the close relationship it 
has developed with the ANC's department of intelligence and 
security. The latter has been willing to work with the NIS, 
whose slate remained relatively clean during the days of "total 
onslaught" and which dealt with the ANC in a sophisticated 
manner. 
  Now that the ANC is in government, its intelligence 
department will be moving almost wholesale into NIS ranks. 
Although relatively small and lacking in trained personnel, it 
brings with it political access to the new ruling party -- a 
vital factor if the agency is to influence government policy and 
secure its budget. 
  It is not yet clear where ministerial responsibility for the 
NIS will fall, but a proposal being closely examined suggests 
that the agency should report to a cabinet under-secretary based 
in the president's office. With a view to making intelligence 
agencies more open to public scrutiny, a parliamentary select 
committee is likely to keep an eye out for abuses of power by 
the intelligence services. Nhlanhla is said to be genuinely 
committed to increasing transparency and accountability. 
  The powers of the other intelligence agencies have been 
severely curtailed by the emergence of the NIS. 
  Officially, MI will be limited to counting other countries' 
tanks and planes. However, it is likely that for as long as the 
army is used for internal law and order operations, it will have 
to run internal intelligence operations. "The army's 
information needs are different from those needed for policing 
operations. If they are deployed internally, they will have to 
collect their own information," said an MI specialist. 
  Because former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC 
military wing] intelligence personnel are available to the ANC, 
the organisation has enough operatives to place in key positions 
in MI and will have a sizeable impact on the agency. 
  The police intelligence capability will be cut back to only 
what is needed to combat crime. 
  The NIS is likely to escape widespread cutbacks, even though 
the military has acknowledged that South Africa does not face 
major military threats in the foreseable future. Ironically, 
say intelligence experts, this means information-collection 
operations need to be beefed up, especially if there is a 
scaling down of the preparedness of conventional forces. 
  "We need longer to get ready, so we need earlier warning," 
explained an intelligence expert. As the chief early-warning 
system, the NIS is likely to benefit from any bolstering of 
South Africa's intelligence capabilities. The NIS is preparing 
for its expanded role by, among others, publicly campaigning to 
recruit more agents into its ranks. 
  The biggest danger facing the new intelligence order is that 
old loyalties will linger: "There will be a drop in the 
standard of collection and analysis simply because of divisions, 
mistrust and empire building by individuals. All agencies have 
that problem." 
  The Transitional Executive Council's [TEC] intelligence 
subcouncil was supposed to provide the TEC with information and 
do the groundwork on restructuring the intelligence services. 
In the end, the council made minimum progress because the 
agencies did not trust each other enough and jealously guarded 
their terrain. New agents will have to resist the temptation to 
report to their old masters. 
  Said Nathan: "There is a danger the new intelligence 
agencies will carry on operating in the old conservative way. 
Mechanisms of control and oversight will therefore be extremely 
important. The competancy of these agencies remains to be seen. 
Deliberate sabotage is an unlikely possibility."

  [Text] Cape Town May 22 SAPA -- Safety and Security 
Minister Sydney Mufamadi says he is "extremely concerned at 
increasing indications of an escalation of violence in 
KwaZulu/Natal and the East Rand". In a statement on Sunday, Mr 
Mufamadi said every possible step had to be taken by both the 
state and civil society to avoid a repetition of the destructive 
cycle of violence experienced before the elections. 
  "Now that South Africa has a democratically elected and 
representative government, absolutely no reason whatsoever 
exists for the kind of political violence which has ravaged our 
country in the past. 
  "This madness must stop. It cannot be allowed to destroy or 
blight the future of our people," he said. 
  Mr Mufamadi added that the Ministry of Safety and Security 
and the South African Police service were engaged in an 
intensive analysis of the current situation in order to develop 
a comprehensive strategy to prevent South Africa from falling 
victim to another destructive cycle of violence.

  [Text] Cape Town May 20 SAPA -- Hendrik Jacobus Coetsee, 
elected president of the Senate on Friday, was born on April 19, 
1931 in the Orange Free State town of Ladybrand. The only child 
of Josephine (born Van Zyl) and Jan Johannes Coetsee, a printer, 
he matriculated in 1948 at Ladybrand school, where he was a 
prefect and a Dux scholar. He completed his BA LLB in 1954 at 
the University of the Orange Free State which, eventually in 
1991, was to honour him as "former kovsie of the year". 
  While at university he served on the students' council for 
extra- mural students and was chairman of the youth branch of 
the NP [National Party]. He was a part-time lecturer in law 
while qualifying as an attorney and practised at the side-bar 
for 17 years before being admitted to the bar in Bloemfontein as 
an advocate in 1972. 
  He was not balloted for military service, but served as a 
volunteer in the President Steyn Regiment's armoured car section 
from 1964-68. 
  Mr Coetsee first went to Parliament in 1968 when he won the 
by- election for the Bloemfontein West seat. In 1985 he became 
leader of the Orange Free State NP at a time when the debate was 
raging on whether measures preventing Asians from entering and 
living in the Free State should be repealed. These measures 
were repealed in September that year after an overwhelming 
affirmative vote at the party's congress. 
  Mr Coetsee served on various parliamentary committees and 
commissions, including the Schlebusch Commission of inquiry into 
certain organisations and the Select Committee on the 
Constitution in 1983. He became chairman of the defence group 
of the NP caucus in 1978, and when Mr P W Botha became prime 
minister he was given the position of deputy minister of defence 
and national intelligence. During his two-year term in this 
position, Mr Coetsee restructured the National Intelligence 
Service and tailored national service requirements to protect 
people suffering financial loss while doing their service. 
  On October 12, 1980 he was appointed minister of justice and 
set about instituting reforms in the legal system. These 
included the introduction of the small claims courts, the 
Matrimonial Property Bill in 1984, which had major repercussions 
on the status of married women, and introduced the accrual 
system of property sharing between spouses. From October 1980 
to July 1991 the portfolio included prisons and the mid-1980's 
produced the lowest incidence of prison complaints for years. 
It was in that role that he liaised between President Nelson 
Mandela and his two predecessors, Mr P W Botha and Deputy 
President F W de Klerk in the years preceding Mr mandela's 
release. He was instrumental, in 1991, in sending top prisons 
officials to the United States on a fact-finding mission about 
community service as a viable alternative sentence to 
imprisonment. A white paper on the subject was released in May 
of that year. 
  The Sharpeville six case rose to prominence in 1987 when six 
people were sentenced to death for the murder of the deputy 
mayor of Lekoa. They were granted various stays of execution 
until, on July 12, 1988, Mr Coetsee deferred their execution 
indefinitely as he wanted to enable the defence lawyers to 
exhaust all legal avenues open to save their clients. The death 
sentence was eventually converted to life imprisonment. 
  In August 1987 President Botha asked Mr Coetsee to look into 
the possible release of Rivonia trialist Mr Govan Mbeki, who was 
serving a life sentence. Mr Mbeki was released later in the 
year. 
  After the African National Congress was unbanned in 1990 and 
Mr Nelson Mandela released, Mr Coetsee was part of the 
government's delegation which held talks in May at Groote 
Schuur. He also put the indemnity bill -- containing provisions 
for conditional and unconditional permanent indemnity -- through 
Parliament which granted temporary immunity to those who might 
serve in negotiation delegations. 
  He married Helena Elizabeth Malan on October 6 1956. They 
have three daughters and two sons.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Land Deal -- "President Mandela has acknowledged his need to 
lean on the experience of Mr F W de Klerk and the Nationalists," 
however the "sly transfer of 1.2 million hectares" of land in 
KwaZulu/Natal to the Zulu king "serves as a warning: Mr Mandela 
had better be careful what lessons Mr de Klerk is permitted to 
pass on to the new South Africa," an editorial in Johannesburg's 
SUNDAY TIMES in English on 22 May on page 22 notes. While Mr de 
Klerk has denied "the transaction was sly," it was "his duty to 
announce to the public any transaction of this magnitude," "that 
he did not do so was contemptible, but, alas, all too typical of 
the wicked regime of the Nationalists." "The Nationalists have 
made an art form of looting by law," as "the country is drowning 
in debt, and people who helped run up that debt are leaving 
office as virtual millionares -- and returning to office." The 
"'experience' that the National Party brings to government: a 
contemptible value system, ruthless greed in the exploitation of 
pensions and public monies, and great skill at manipulating 
legalities to achieve tricky ends. The Zulu land deal is a 
typical example, and in defending it Mr de Klerk simply confirms 
the need for the new government to treat his 'experience' with 
care, lest it poison the entire administration sand defeat the 
democratic purposes of the new government." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Reconstruction, Develoipment Program -- A doubly expensive 
RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] will not impress 
investors, is the reaction on a page 12 editorial in BEELD of 19 
May in Afrikaans to reports that the ANC's estimation of the 
cost of the RDP has increased from 39 billion rands before the 
election to between 80 billion and 90 billion rands. "Such a 
radical modification of a program, which President Nelson 
Mandela has dubbed 'our economic Bible,' will cause people to 
wonder whether the new government realizes the realities of the 
country, and whether it will take the right decisions on that 
basis." "The ANC apparently has in its possession an 
unpublished report on the RDP in which key issues are hopefully 
handled. This report must be published as soon as possible." 
The editorial points out that possible investors in South 
Africa will hold their money back until they are satisfied that 
the government is able to manage the economy responsibly. The 
recent performance by the shares and capital markets, and the 
record weakening of the rand reflect the view of investors. "If 
the amount of the RDP has doubled within a matter of weeks, one 
wonders whether it will double a few times more in the future." 
  Rwanda Decision -- A second editorial in the 19 May BEELD 
titled "South Africa Not Heading for Rwanda" commends the 
decision by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo that South Africa will 
not make troops available to the UN for peace operations in 
Rwanda. "It must be understood that the new government, now 
that South Africa is no longer a reject in the international 
arena, wants to do something in the short term to underline its 
new status and its leadership role in Africa. But such actions 
will have to be carefully and thoroughly assessed first, because 
the disadvantages could easily outweigh the advantages 
considerably within a short space of time." "The very first 
priority is that the South African National Defense Force should 
become a solid, well oiled instrument capable of becoming a 
peaceful foreign policy instrument." 
<H8>  ILANGA </H8>
  Get to work -- Durban ILANGA in Zulu on 19-21 May in a page 
8 
editorial says: "Now that we are steeped in this time of change 
in the entire country, including KwaZulu/Natal, everyone needs 
to undergo an attitude change, to realize that this time of 
change means buckling down to hard work in this country. It 
would be unfortunate to have people who think it all means 
getting laid back and doing nothing. On the contrary, this is 
the time for each and everyone to work harder than ever before 
in an effort to rebuilt our country. Now is the real start of 
the struggle for freedom. Let the employees work harder now 
than before, the teacher teach with more dedication than ever, 
the nurse seek to give patients the best care possible. Let the 
scholar study harder than ever before. Whatever you find to do, 
do it to the best of your ability to raise the standard of the 
country and your own as well." "This time of change throws us 
the great challenge of standing firm to fight the enemies of 
freedom of both black and white. These enemies are poverty, 
disease and ignorance. Let us all mobilize to rebuild our 
country."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Pay Scale Recommendations -- "The issue of politicians' pay- 
packets in the new South Africa...will not go away. Nor should 
it." So begins an editorial in the Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English on 23 May on page 10. The editorial argues that it is 
wrong to justify the pay recommendations with comparisons to 
what previous government leaders or corporate executives or 
leaders of foreign countries are paid. It concludes by calling 
for President Mandela "to take the lead in suggesting that the 
Melamet proposals be scaled down -- not to the point of punitive 
austerity, but to be in line with South Africa's economic status 
in the world." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Credit Responsibilities -- An editorial in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on page 10 on 23 May begins by noting 
that accepting the responsibilities "that will come with the 
granting of an international credit rating will be central to 
gaining access to international capital markets." It goes on to 
argue that South Africa must convince the credit rating agencies 
"that excessive government spending will not derail the economy 
and that the money we borrow will be used to generate the 
economic growth needed to underpin our capacity to service our 
domestic and foreign debt." Noting the importance of both the 
Reconstruction and Development Plan and the way it is to be 
financed, the editorial concludes: "Just as President Mandela 
will need to reassure the electorate that government's domestic 
responsibilities will not be shirked so, too, will he need to 
guarantee to the rest of the world that the country's 
international responsibilities will not be subordinated to 
domestic political expediency." 
  Land Transfer -- An editorial in the Johannesburg SOWETAN in 
English on page 10 on 23 May examines the "surreptitious KwaZulu 
land transfer," which, it argues, "was a cynical attempt by the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] to secure and expand its power base 
and deny an ANC-dominated central government a sphere of 
influence in a major part of KwaZulu-Natal." The editorial 
characterizes the role of former President de Klerk in the deal 
as "somewhat inexplicable" and says that the motive of the IFP 
should have been obvious to him and should have caused him to 
balk on the deal. The editorial concludes: "A reversal of the 
transfer is an obvious option but not necessarily the correct or 
only one. We urge President Nelson Mandela to make a careful 
study of the situation and not be rushed into a response or 
decision." 
  Affirmative Action -- The Cape Town CAPE TIMES in English 
carries an editorial on page 8 of its 18 May issue in which it 
addresses the need for an affirmative action program. It argues 
that "affirmative action should be enforceable by law" because 
leaving it to the discretion of employers would result in 
tokenism. On the other hand, it advises against "a blanket 
scheme with specific quotas." The editorial continues: "A 
comprehensive policy of training must be embarked on. The 
training must be from the bottom up, so that black employees are 
not promoted beyond their own levels of experience or 
qualifications....Nothing can be more damaging to the 
self-esteem of promising black employees than to find themselves 
in positions with which they cannot cope. Merit must be a major 
criterion, even if it is not the only one."

  [Text] Fears of a guerrilla war waged by young supporters 
of ousted Malawian President Kamuzu Banda have resurfaced in 
Malawi following this week's inauguration of President Bakili 
Muluzi. 
  Although Dr. Banda was toppled in last week's elections, the 
election results also showed that Dr. Banda and his Malawi 
Congress Party [MCP] are still a powerful force in the country. 
With five seats still undeclared, the MCP has won 52 seats and 
will be the second-largest party in Parliament after Mr. 
Muluzi's United Democratic Front, which captured 84 seats. Dr. 
Banda also came second in the race for president. Fuelling the 
fears of guerrilla war are reports that at least 2,000 armed 
members of the MCP youth wing, the Young Pioneers, are in hiding 
in Mozambique. President Muluzi, who once commanded the Young 
Pioneers when he was an aid to Dr. Banda, said last week he was 
very concerned about these armed young men hiding in Mozambique 
and that he expected that they would be a source of violence. 
  He said his government would seek their immediate return 
home 
by appealing to Mozambique's government and the Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance] movement, whose camps the 
pioneers are alleged to be using as a repayment for Dr. Banda's 
staunch support for Renamo in the 1980's.

  [Text] Geneva, May 20 (AFP) -- Hundreds of thousands of 
people are fleeing central Rwanda as heavy fighting in the 
capital Kigali and elsewhere in the central African nation 
causes a new exodus of refugees, an International Committee of 
the Red Cross [ICRC] spokesman said Friday. 
  The ICRC appealed for UN peacekeepers to be sent in as 
quickly as possible and for the establishment of humanitarian 
corridors through the country. 
  Up to half a million Rwandans are believed to have died in 
ethnic and political killings between members of the Hutu and 
Tutsi people that broke out in early April.

  [Text] Members of the UNITA [National Union for the Total

Huambo yesterday for consultations with the party leadership. 
The delegation includes party Secretary General Eugenio 
Manuvakola, the leader of the delegation; Information Secretary 
Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim; Dr. Isaias Samakuva; and Cipriano 
Chipipa, the party representative in Zambia. Senior party and 
government officials as well as members of the General Staff of 
the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola welcomed the 
delegation. Our correspondent Lourenco Bento interviewed 
Manuvakola on arrival: 
  [Begin recording] [Manuvakola] We have come here for 
consultations. We have been in Lusaka for over two months now. 
We came here for consultations because we need to adopt a 
program of action for the last phase of the negotiations. 
  [Bento] What progress has been made? 
  [Manuvakola] The talks are almost over. We have left on the 
negotiating table the outstanding issues on national 
reconciliation. We expect Luanda to comment on UNITA's 
participation in the cabinet. The government has not done so 
yet. 
  [Bento] Circles in Luanda have described the Lusaka talks as 
a carnival. Do you share the same view? 
  [Manuvakola] Well, if they have gone to Lusaka for a 
carnival, I think they are [words indistinct] mandate their 
president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos, has given to the government 
negotiators. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Manuvakola] I think so. Peace is possible as long as there 
is willingness, particularly on the part of the Luanda 
government. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Government of the Republic of </F>
Angola on 21 May] 
  [Text] The Government of the Republic of Angola strongly 
condemns the actions carried out by the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] against the World Food 
Program [WFP] planes rendering humanitarian assistance to the 
victims of war and other disasters. The government feels that 
the actions against WFP planes in the city of Malange on 16, 18, 
19, and 20 May, forcing the WFP to suspend humanitarian 
assistance to Malange residents, constitute a flagrant violation 
of UNITA's pledge regarding the distribution of humanitarian 
assistance to all needy Angolan people, regardless of the area 
where they are found. 
  The government would also like to inform the national and 
international communities about the raids carried out by UNITA 
armed elements against the warehouses of international 
nongovernmental organizations in the provinces of Uige and 
Huambo. It also condemns the diversion of goods destined to the 
needy for military purposes. 
  In view of this unfavorable picture created by UNITA, the 
Government of the Republic of Angola has decided to temporarily 
suspend the WFP and international nongovernmental organizations' 
flights to the provinces of Huambo and Uige until the United 
Nations is able to inform the Government of the Republic of 
Angola that conditions have been reestablished for the 
continuation of humanitarian flights in conditions of security. 
  The government would once again like to call on the 
international community to exercise pressure on UNITA to respect 
the principles of humanitarian assistance and not use this 
assistance for other purposes.

  [Text] Malange residents have once again been penalized 
following yet another National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola [UNITA] attack on a World Food Program [WFP] airplane 
carrying relief aid. Albino Malungo, minister of assistance and 
social reintegration, discusses the situation: 
  [Begin recording] [Malungo] Right now, Malange is the 
province with the largest food supply problems. The province 
has a huge population and people cannot work. They depend on 
relief aid from the government, the United Nations, and 
nongovernmental organizations [NGO's]. That is a sad situation 
because UNITA is still not serious. It is using relief aid for 
political gain. From 16 to 20 May UNITA attacked WFP aircraft. 
That is a gross violation. We have already had talks with the 
United Nations and will once again meet its officials this 
afternoon. I think the government will take measures regarding 
supplies for UNITA in areas like Huambo and Jamba where we are 
not sure whether UNITA has distributed aid to the right people. 
  [Unidentified correspondet] Does that mean retaliatory 
action 
will be taken? 
  [Malungo] Not exactly. Regarding the suspension of relief 
aid for Huambo, I have information that UNITA soldiers raided 
NGO and UN warehouses. They either did it on their own or were 
following orders. That is a violation of the principles 
governing relief aid. We are owed an explanation. [end

  [Excerpts] In addition to its cruel, successive 
bombardments of densely populated areas, the Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos regime is once again using international relief aid as a 
weapon against the people, particularly those living in areas 
controlled by the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA]. 
  Sources with the UNITA relief services today reacted to 
statements made to the Portuguese television [as heard] TSF 
[wireless] channel by the MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party] minister for social 
reintegration. According to the minister, UNITA troops raided 
World Food Program [WFP] warehouses in the cities of Huambo, 
Uige, and Jamba. Minister Albino Malungo's remarks were 
unfortunate and have been dismissed by [name indistinct], WFP 
spokesman in Luanda. Unlike in the regime's areas, there is 
neither wholesale theft nor social evils in UNITA-administered 
territory. [passage omitted] 
  Other sources told our correspondent that Albino Malungo's 
unfounded remarks are hypocritical because he should remember 
that Norberto dos Santos, his predecessor in the same ministry, 
was dismissed for diverting relief aid donated by international 
relief agencies. The source added that such a situation is not 
applicable to UNITA-controlled areas. 
  The sources urged the international community and relief 
agencies operating in Angola not to allow themselves to be 
deceived by Jose Eduardo dos Santos' regime. The regime intends 
to use the shortages faced by Angolans to effectively implement 
its militarist plan. The sources added that the United Nations 
should as a matter of urgency review its operations in Angola so 
that these cover the whole country, without discrimination.

<F P=106> [By Estelle Randall and Farouk Chothia] </F>
  [Text] Former state president F W de Klerk ceded control of 
a third of the land in KwaZulu/Natal to Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini in a highly secretive deal the day before he was 
voted out of office last month. The transfer of three million 
hectares scattered throughout the province was effected in terms 
of the KwaZulu Ingonyama [King's] Trust Act, passed by the 
KwaZulu Legislative Assembly and assented to by De Klerk on 
April 25 this year. 
  In terms of the legislation, King Goodwill Zwelithini, the 
sole trustee, will administer all tribal land in the province -- 
with the cost of administration being borne by the new regional 
government. It covers all the land for which the KwaZulu 
Legislative Assembly was established in 1971 and land acquired 
by the KwaZulu government under various proclamations and laws 
since then. 
  It appears that under pressure from the KwaZulu government, 
De Klerk moved to prevent KwaZulu-administered tribal land from 
falling under state control -- the automatic effect of the new 
constitution, which kicked in on April 27 -- in an apparent sop 
to the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in exchange for its 
participation in the April poll. 
  A source close to Andre Fourie, the former minister of 
regional and land affairs, said the land transfer had been part 
of negotiations between the National Party government, the ANC 
and the IFP. 
  But ANC Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa, who played a key 
role in the negotiations leading to the IFP's participation in 
the elections, denied this: "The Ingonyama Trust doesn't mean a 
thing to me; I'm hearing about it for the first time. I doubt 
very much that Nelson Mandela would have known about it. You 
are drawing a blank from me." 
  President Nelson Mandela's office was yesterday unable to 
comment, as was the office of Zwelithini. 
  ANC leaders in KwaZulu/Natal also appeared dumbfounded when 
approached this week. Regional supremo Jacob Zuma said he knew 
nothing of the transfer, and knew of no one else in the ANC who 
was aware of it. "It is surprising that this happened just 
before the election." 
  And in a furious reaction, ANC Midlands spokesman Blade 
Nzimane said: "The fact that this was done behind the backs of 
people and through an illegitimate bantustan structure seems to 
indicate that it was aimed at undermining any constitutional 
accommodation of the king by the ANC. 
  "It seems to have been aimed at ensuring that KwaZulu 
retained actual control of the land even if it was disbanded." 
  Also unaware of the transfer was Roelf Meyer, the NP's 
[National Party] central constitutional negotiator; Conie de 
Villiers, director-general of land affairs -- who said "nobody 
consulted me about this Act" -- and the new Minister of Land 
Affairs, Derek Hanekom, who said he was "shocked" by the move. 
  "Effectively the land that was KwaZulu is no longer state 
land," Hanekom said. "It's in private ownership, held in trust 
by the king." He added: "My ministry will be raising the issue 
politically and will be carrying out a full investigation to 
find out on whose ultimate authority the transfer was affected. 
  "We have consistently tried to get a moratorium on the 
transfer and sale of state land, but we never thought bantustan 
land would be transferred. 
  "There are potentially grave political implications and 
we're 
deeply concerned." He hinted that the National Assembly might 
overturn the legislation. 
  Some IFP sources described the formation of the Ingonyama 
Trust as a "house-keeping arrangement" between Chief Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi and De Klerk's governments before their demise -- and 
an attempt to protect the monarch from possible ANC rule in 
KwaZulu/Natal. 
  "The chances of the land ever being alienated (from the 
king) 
are now remote in the extreme," said an IFP source. 
  Zuma insisted the formation of the Ingonyama Trust was not 
part of the agreement that brought the IFP into elections. "We 
made an elaborate proposal for the monarchy so far as 
KwaZulu/Natal is concerned which we still have to iron out in 
the provincial constitution." 
  Observers believe the legislation has far-reaching 
implications: it means that future governments in the province 
will have to gain Zwelithini's permission -- or the permission 
of his chiefs or any other representative he charges with 
decision-making responsibility over the trust land -- before 
engaging in any development on the land in question. It means 
that land earmarked for redistribution in terms of the ANC's 
land reform plans is no longer available to the central state. 
  Barely 300,000ha [hectares] of state land is now available 
for redistribution. 
  The formation of the trust also consolidates the 
relationship 
between Zwelithini and chiefs, as they will now be reliant on 
him for development in their areas -- and will reduce the 
prospect of an ANC-led government in KwaZulu/Natal winning major 
support among IFP- aligned traditional rulers. 
  Lawyers contacted yesterday stressed the land deal had not 
gone before the Transitional Executive Council which had 
overthrown other land decisions. They also said that a 
challenge to the land transfer could be mounted. In terms of 
court precedents, changes to the ownership status of state land 
could not be made without consultation with the effected parties.

<F P=106> [Report by Carmel Rickard] </F>
  [Text] Deciding on a capital of KwaZulu Natal has the 
potential to become one of the most bitter wrangles in the power 
struggle between the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and ANC in the 
province. Ulundi, Durban and Maritzburg are being considered. 
  Premier Frank Mdlalose says the members of the provincial 
legislature should decide the issue -- but his decision to hold 
the next cabinet meeting in Ulundi has been interpreted as 
indicating his own preference. 
  ANC officials have objected to Ulundi, saying they would not 
be safe there. ANC provincial cabinet minister S'bu Ndebele 
said it would not make sense to travel for six hours to attend 
cabinet meetings in Ulundi. 
  The notorious road and bad phone connections are further 
obstacles to making Ulundi the capital, say critics.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 20 SAPA -- Land Affairs Minister 
Derek Hanekom met President Nelson Mandela on Friday morning to 
discuss the KwaZulu land deal that handed all tribal land in 
KwaZulu to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini before the April 
elections. Mr Hanekom said Mr Mandela had undertaken to raise 
the matter with former President F W de Klerk on Monday. 
  Mr Hanekom said: "I am not in a position to confirm or deny 
that we knew about this." 
  The WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN reported on Friday that the 
Ingonyama [King's] Land Trust Act transferred KwaZulu tribal 
land to the king in return for the Inkatha Freedom Party's 
participation in the elections. 
  Senior officials of the Department of Regional and Land 
Affairs told SAPA on Friday it was widely understood that the 
land deal involving three million hectares was linked to a 
constitutional settlement whose effect was to end the Inkatha 
Freedom Party's elections boycott. One official who did not want 
to be named said KwaZulu government officials made several 
approaches to the department's legal advisers for assistance in 
drawing up the legislation. 
  They had been refused on the grounds that the self-governing 
territories drafted their own legislation for the final approval 
of the state president. 
  However, their approaches eventually resulted in the 
department's legal advisers going to Ulundi on April 21 to draw 
up the law in conjunction with the KwaZulu government's legal 
advisers. 
  The official said the impression he had gained was that the 
deal had been decided in talks between Mr de Klerk, Mr Mandela 
and IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
several days earlier. 
  The law was passed by the KwaZulu legislative assembly on 
April 22 and was approved by Mr de Klerk on April 25 when 
Parliament sat to pass constitutional amendments whose effect 
was to draw the IFP into the elections. The amendments conferred 
greater powers on provincial structures and secured the position 
of King Zwelithini in Natal/KwaZulu's executive structures. 
  The effect of the land legislation was to exempt KwaZulu 
tribal land from the provision that all self-governing 
territories' land was to become the property of central 
government under the new constitution. 
  The WEEKLY MAIL reported that the deal took ANC chief 
negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa and Mr Hanekom by surprise. The story 
claimed the deal left little land for redistribution under the 
new government's land redistribution policies. 
  In a statement, Mr Hanekom said he became aware of the land 
deal only after enquiries by the media. It has been ascertained 
that senior leaders of both the IFP and the ANC in Natal had no 
knowledge of the passage of this act. 
  "The Ministry of Land Affairs is deeply concerned about this 
issue and is at the moment investigating both the process that 
led to the passage of this act as well as its legal 
implications," he said. 
  He said any further information would be released as soon as 
it became available.

<F P=106> [By Guy Rogers and Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg May 20 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela 
said on Friday the first he heard of the "land deal" between 
KwaZulu and the former South African Government was in media 
reports. 
  In his reaction to the same issue, which hit the headlines 
on 
Friday morning, former President F W de Klerk denied the 
transaction was a "secret deal" or that it was hatched up to 
draw the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] into the elections. 
  The two leaders were reacting to a report that three million 
hectares of land were transferred to Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini under the Ingonyama [King's] Land Trust Act in return 
for the IFP's participation in the April poll. In its front-page 
story, the WEEKLY MAIL AND GUARDIAN called it a "highly 
secretive deal". 
  A senior source in the Department of Regional and Land 
Affairs, who did not want to be named, told SAPA the impression 
he had gained was the deal had been decided in talks between Mr 
Mandela, former President F W de Klerk and IFP President 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  But the statement from Mr Mandela's office on Friday night 
said he wished "to state categorically that he only became aware 
of the land deal today". Neither he nor any official in his 
African National Congress had been involved in discussions on 
the alleged deal. 
  Mr de Klerk said there was no truth in the allegation by the 
WEEKLY MAIL that he had "secretly" handed land to King Goodwill. 
The transaction had its origin in the adoption of the KwaZulu 
Ingonyama Trust Bill, which was openly debated and adopted by 
the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly (KLA) -- "so there can be no 
question of any kind of secrecy or of any action 'behind the 
backs of the people'." 
  Mr de Klerk said the bill was presented to him for signature 
on April 25. In terms of his constitutional duties he was 
obliged to approve legislation which had ben duly adopted by the 
KLA on matters which fell within its area of competance. "I 
nevertheless took special steps before signing... to ascertain 
whether it did, in fact, fall within the competence (of the KLA). 
  "I was assured that in terms of Act No 21 of 1971 it did." 
  Mr de Klerk said the purpose of the act was not to place any 
obstacle in the way of future land redistribution or to limit 
the powers of any future government. Neither was the transaction 
part of a deal between the government, the Zulu king, the IFP 
and Mr Mandela to ensure Inkatha's participation in the 
election, as had been alleged. 
  A statement from Home Affairs Minister and IFP President 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said accusations of a "secretive" deal were 
nothing but "cheap politicking and mischief-making by people who 
do not want peace in our troubled land". He said the intention 
of the Ingonyama Trust Act was to "return the land to the tribes 
and communities to whom it originally belonged before it was 
taken away by statutory prescription after the Zulu conquest. 
  "It is our tradition that all land belongs to the king, who 
holds it in trust for the people. He cannot dispose of it in 
terms of the act." 
  Senior officials in the Department of Regional and Land 
Affairs told SAPA it was widely understood the land transaction, 
involving three million hectares, was a deal linked to a 
constitutional settlement whose effect was aimed at ending the 
IFP's elections boycott. 
  The effect of the legislation passed was to exempt KwaZulu 
tribal land from the provision that all self-governing 
territories land was to become the property of central 
government under the new constitution. 
  One official who did not want to be named said KwaZulu 
government officials made several approaches to the department's 
legal advisers for assistance in drawing up the legislation. 
They had been refused on the grounds that the self-governing 
territories drafted their own legislation for the final approval

was to draw the IFP into the elections. The amendments conferred 
greater powers on provincial structures and secured the position 
of King Goodwill in Natal/KwaZulu's executive structures. 
  The WEEKLY MAIL reported the deal took ANC Chief Negotiator 
Cyril Ramaphosa and new Lands Minister Derek Hanekom by

redistribution under the new government's land redistribution 
policies.

knowledge of the passage of this act. 
  "The Ministry of Land Affairs is deeply concerned about this 
issue and is at the moment investigating both the process that 
led to the passage of this act as well as its legal 
implications," he said. 
  Mr Mandela said on Friday night he would issue a more 
comprehensive statement as soon as he had studied the act and 
consulted all the concerned parties.

  [Text] Cape Town May 23 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela 
and home affairs minister Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi held talks 
on Monday morning on the KwaZulu land issue and the appointment 
of the KwaZulu/Natal provincial cabinet, a spokesman for the 
president's office said. 
  Press spokesman Mr Joel Netshitenzhe said at 10.30 that the 
meeting -- at Mr Mandela's official residence Westbrooke -- 
"should be over by now". The two men had talked for about 
one-and-a-half hours, he said. As far as he knew, deputy 
president Mr FW de Klerk had not been present. The intention 
was not to issue a press statement before the cabinet meeting 
due to start at 11AM. 
  Earlier, minister of land affairs Mr Derek Hanekom cancelled 
a press conference scheduled for Monday so that the president 
and cabinet could discuss the KwaZulu land issue before he was 
asked to answer any further questions on it. A spokesman for 
his office said the press conference, set up early last week, 
was to have dealt with land restitution. After the KwaZulu land 
issue hit the headlines questions on it at the press conference 
were unavoidable. "Mr Hanekom would not like to comment until 
we hear something from the president," she said. 
  Last week the ANC in KwaZulu/Natal asked to be excused from 
proceedings in the provincial cabinet after expressing 
dissatisfaction with the ministerial portfolios allocated to it. 
Provincial premier Dr Frank Mdladlose said a meeting to discuss 
the issue had been called for Tuesday. 
  It was also reported last week that the day before former 
President de Klerk was voted out of office, he ceded control 
over some three million hectares of KwaZulu state land to a 
trust headed by King Goodwill Zwelethini. ANC leaders in Natal 
were enraged by the move, calling it a "deal made behind the 
people's backs".

  [Text] Cape Town May 23 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela on 
Monday expressed his satisfaction following discussions on the 
KwaZulu land transfer with the minister of home affairs, Chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The two men met at Westbrooke, the 
president's official residence, for about one-and-a-half hours. 
  "I am happy with the candid and harmonious manner in which 
we 
addressed this issue. We are discussing it as a very important 
and sensitive issue. I'm sure that with the good relationship 
between ourselves, we can address the matter to the satisfaction 
of all," Mr Mandela said. 
  President Mandela said both he and Chief Buthelezi would now 
refer the matter to their respective organisations for any 
decision. "I am satisfied with the progress which we have made. 
It now depends of our organisations," he said. 
  Chief Buthelezi said he had explained to Mr Mandela that the 
land in question had been transferred to the KwaZulu government 
three years ago. The government had then decided to transfer 
the land to different Zulu tribes living in the area as communal 
land. "There is nothing new in this. There is no hanky panky. 
It is insulting to suggest that the land was given to the 
king." He accused the media of "trying to drive a wedge between 
the ANC and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]". 
  The two leaders also discussed the allocation of cabinet 
portfolios to the IFP and the siting of the KwaZulu/Natal 
provincial capital. Chief Buthelezi said the location of the 
capital should be put to the people of the province in a 
referendum. 
  He said the IFP accepted the fact that it would not get the 
health portfolio as initially indicated. The ANC's Dr Nkosazana 
Zuma has been appointed minister of health. 
  The chief, who was accompanied by deputy minister of 
security 
services Joe Matthews and Prince Gideon Zulu of the Zulu royal 
house, responded angrily when a journalist asked whether the 
land transfer may be repealed. "It seems to me you don't want 
peace in South Africa," he said.

  [Text] Cape Town May 23 SAPA -- Suggestions that the 
KwaZulu land deal was intended to lure the Inkatha Freedom Party 
into the April elections were "rubbish" and "nonsense", home 
affairs minister Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi asserted on Monday. 
"It was the legislation passed in Parliament that brought me 
into the election," Chief Buthelezi said. 
  Answering reporters' questions on his way to joining his 
cabinet colleagues for their first meeting at Tuynhuys, Mr 
Buthelezi said the Ingonyama [kings'] Trust Act had been debated 
in open session in the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. In terms of 
the legislation, the 1.2 million hectares of KwaZulu tribal land 
-- that would have become state property under the new 
constitution -- was ceded to Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The 
legislation had been approved by former President FW de Klerk 
"in the way that he signs all legislation". 
  Mr de Klerk approved the Ingonyama Trust Act on April 25, 
four days after it was passed by the KwaZulu government. "All 
communal land was always protected. It was to prevent it 
becoming state land," he said. 
  The land was transferred to the KwaZulu government three 
years ago. "I don't find anything controversial in it," he 
said. Chief Buthelezi said the issue would not be discussed at 
the cabinet meeting.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Derek Hanekom, South African </F>
regional and land affairs minister, by Phillip van Niekerk in 
Pretoria; date not given: "South African Land Gradually Passing 
Into Black Hands"] 
  [Text] Derek Hanekom, the new regional and land affairs 
minister and one of the two white ANC ministers in the national 
coalition government, has much more on his mind than old 
symbols: He must satisfy the expectations of the millions of 
poor living in the South African countryside. Just 13 percent 
of the agricultural land is owned by the black majority, a 
figure frequently quoted as illustrative of the injustice of 
apartheid. The ANC's ambitious Restructuring and Development 
Program will stand or fall on the thorny question of land reform. 
  In August 1993, the World Bank forecast a violent uprising 
by 
farmers if the land was not shared out. Hanekom, who has headed 
the ANC Land Commission for the past four years, does not agree. 
"The World Bank has exaggerated the possibility of a revolt. 
If the people in the countryside had been at the point of 
rebellion, we would certainly have been able to mobilize them 
during the struggle for liberation." 
  Hanekom believes that South Africa is very different from 
Zimbabwe where, following independence in 1980, the desire for 
land and the failure of Robert Mugabe's government to give land 
to farmers was one of the central political issues. 
  "In Zimbabwe, there was a large population of farmers and 
very little land. They wanted their own land more than anything 
else. The liberation movement therefore had the support of the 
farmers." Hanekom believes that the population in the South 
African countryside wants facilities and services more than 
anything else, such as water, electricity, better health care, 
and pensions. 
  "The PAC [Pan African Congress] judged the situation very 
badly. They considered land reform to be the most important 
question and stated that the rest would follow. Very few people 
in the countryside believed that." This does not mean that the 
ANC is not committed to ambitious land reforms. The aim is to 
redistribute 30 percent of agricultural land within five years. 
Hanekom does not believe he is promising something he cannot 
deliver. 
  Hanekom's commission has drawn up a very detailed reform 
program for the ANC. His expertise is one of the principal 
reasons why he has been given this important job, although many 
in the ANC feel that, due to its symbolic value, the post should 
have gone to an African. 
  The ANC wants to begin by the return of land to black 
communities which were forcibly evicted from it under apartheid. 
A special court will be set up to hear land claims. Special 
loans are also to be introduced to make it easier for poor 
farmers to buy their land. 
  The government will help black farmers to start farms on 
land 
which is at present owned by the state or white farmers. 
Tenancy laws will be reformed, giving tenants, who had no 
rights to the land they cultivated, the right to buy. 
Supporting measures are also to be introduced for farmers who 
are already cultivating their own land. 
  "Our land reform program can only be successful if the 
people 
support it. And that means also better planning, water, 
electricity, housing, and hospitals. Redistributing the land is 
not in itself enough." 
  The land reform could result in a major conflict with one of 
the country's most powerful lobbies, the white farmers and their 
large-scale farming. This does not discourage Hanekom. He 
believes that talk of farmers about to oppose the schemes are 
exaggerated. He believes government intervention to be 
unavoidable, because at least one third of white farmers are so 
deeply in debt that they are never going to be able to get out 
of the situation without the state's support. 
  "Even if we wanted to maintain the status quo, government 
intervention would still be necessary. The debts are the result 
of difficult trading conditions and poor financial management. 
In the past, it was too easy for white farmers to obtain loans. 
You can only keep these farmers in place if you agree to 
subsidize them. We find it only logical for some farmers, who 
are very heavily in debt, to sell their farms. Some farms have 
already been repossessed. That provides an opportunity to 
establish black farmers. We must make the most of these 
opportunities." 
  "Our program is not based on repossessions and evictions. 
These measures will only be used in cases of extreme urgency. 
But if this program is not successful, we will then have to 
look at more drastic measures." 
  Hanekom is not afraid of encountering opposition among the 
bureaucrats in his ministry who were once committed to the 
apartheid ideology of Verwoerd. "We have inherited people who, 
in the past supported the previous policy. But in general the 
ministry is staffed by very able people, that I have already 
noticed. It took us time to get to know one another. But some 
ministry staffers are already committed to the reorganization." 
  As if they sought to emphasize Hanekom's words, we found 
that 
following the interview, the portrait of De Klerk and the old 
land law had been removed from the walls. Nothing has yet been 
put up to replace them.

  [Text] Cape Town May 22 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress's parliamentary caucus on Sunday evening elected ANC 
Secretary-General Mr Cyril Ramaphosa to chair South Africa's 
Constitutional Assembly which is to draw up the country's final 
constitution. 
  Ms Bridgit Mabandla is to be the ANC's nomination for deputy 
chair, but this post may still, in terms of government of 
national unity considerations, be given to a National Party 
member. 
  The Constitutional Assembly -- consisting of senators and 
National Assembly members -- is to be constituted at Parliament 
on Tuesday morning. 
  ANC Chief Whip Mr Arnold Stofile told a press briefing after 
the caucus meeting that Mr Ramaphosa would act as a "political 
rudder" to ensure the principles laid down in the interim 
constitution, as well as the ANC's own principles, were adhered 
to. 
  Mr Ramaphosa had been earmarked for the position "all 
along". 
He would also remain ANC secretary-general, Mr Stofile said. 
  The caucus had also decided to appoint its own sub-committee 
into political office-bearer's remuneration. 
  The view that the Melamet Commission had proposed high 
salaries for politicians was "not an accurate reflection", Mr 
Stofile said. "We think the proposals are not market-related." 
  Caucus hoped the cabinet would move fast in appointing a 
commission into the matter, proposed by the Melamet Commission. 
  Mr Stofile said on average no MP would earn more than 10,000 
rand a month. "I don't think that's market-related." 
  Salaries could even be higher, he said. 
  The deputy minister of finance, Mr Alec Erwin, and MP Mr 
Raymond Suttner would serve on the ANC's sub-committee into the 
matter. 
  -- Mr Themba Msimang was elected caucus chairman.

  [Text] Cape Town May 22 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela on 
Sunday night held discussions with a Pan Africanist Congress 
[PAC] delegation led by PAC leader Mr Clarence Makwetu on the 
integration of the PAC's armed formation into the South African 
National Defence Force [SANDF]. 
  The newly-appointed chief director of communications in Mr 
Mandela's office, Mr Joel Netshitenzhe, said the PAC was 
interested in participation in an integrated defence force and 
the ANC in principle agreed that the relevant legislation should 
be examined. 
  Defence Minister Mr Joe Modise had been part of Mr Mandela's 
delegation at Sunday night's talks, and Mrs Patricia de Lille 
part of Mr Makwetu's. 
  Mr Netshitenzhe said talks between Mr Mandela and Home 
Affairs Minister Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi about the controversial 
KwaZulu land deal would possibly not take place on Sunday night, 
but on Monday morning before the Cabinet meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Text] President Nelson Mandela this week began to gather 
around him personal staff who will be his voice, his ears and 
the guardians of the most privileged secrets of the highest 
office in the land. 
  Those appointed include: 
  -- Professor Jakes Gerwel, the former rector and 
vice-chancellor of the University of the Western Cape who has 
been appointed as Mr Mandela's director-general. 
  -- Mr Ahmed Kathrada, the Rivonia trialist who was 
imprisoned 
on Robben Island along with Mr Mandela. His job in the 
president's office involves acting as Mr Mandela's liaison with 
Parliament. Mr Kathrada has a reputation for being a backroom 
worker totally loyal to Mr Mandela. 
  -- Mr Joe Netshitenzhe, who is also called Peter Mayibuye, 
will be employed as the chief director of communications in Mr 
Mandela's office. Mr Netshitenzhe, 38, is considered one of the 
bright young intellectuals in the ANC and served on the 
organisation's Negotiations Commission and the Electoral 
Commission. He edited the ANC's propaganda publication Mayibuye 
since 1980 and worked on Radio Freedom before then. He is also 
a member of the ANC's national working committee. 
  -- Mrs Mary Mxadana, an employee of the SA [South Africa] 
Council of Churches for more than 10 years, has been appointed 
as Mr Mandela's private secretary. From 1992, she headed the 
Ecumenical Monitoring Programme in SA (Empsa), which brought out 
500 monitors from church organisations abroad to monitor 
violence and later the elections. She also has a good voice, 
having been one of the members of the choir which sang at Mr 
Mandela's inauguration.

<F P=106> [By Connie Molusi] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg May 21 SAPA -- State President Nelson 
Mandela on Saturday vowed to go ahead with his Reconstruction 
and Development Programme [RDP] as a tribute to fellow 
countrymen who had sacrificed themselves in the anti-apartheid 
struggle -- in spite of criticism of the huge spending involved. 
Speaking at the funeral service of his former co-accused and 
fellow Robben Island prisoner Elias Motsoaledi in Soweto, Mr 
Mandela said delivering on the ANC election promises was the 
best tribute to the victims of apartheid and its stalwarts. 
  The RDP programme came under criticism this week, with 
experts predicting it would cost between 80 and 90 billion rand, 
more than twice the initial ANC costing of 39 billion rand over 
five years. He said the ANC-led government of national unity was 
constituted by people from different backgrounds, with genuine 
and well-meaning white colleagues not used to huge expenditures 
to meet the needs of African people. 
  Defending the RDP, Mr Mandela said the ANC leadership came 
from a background of squalor and misery and understood the 
deprivation of black South Africans better than their white 
colleagues who had had a wealthy and comfortable upbringing. 
"Delivery on the RDP should not threaten the property of 
minorities and their living standards, but have to meet the 
expectations of people within a reasonable space of time. 
  "There are minorities in this country who believe the 
implementation of this programme will lead to falling living 
standards." 
  But he added that a balance had to be maintained between 
uplifting the black majority and not destroying the wealth the 
country already had. 
  While there was broad agreement, the ANC leadership would 
have to take the initiative for delivering quality education, 
electricity and water in urban and rural areas, he added. 
  Mr Mandela took off time from his tight schedule to share 
his 
experiences with Mr Motsoaledi during their long spell of 
imprisonment on Robben Island. Paying tribute to a comrade and 
their long friendship, he said Mr Motsoaledi had helped ordinary 
people regain their pride and dignity and had inspired hope. "We 
are honouring a man who helped to end South Africa's isolation." 
  "Motsoaledi was a non-conformist. He did not agree with 
ideas 
unless he considered them carefully. 
  "He was a founder of Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation] 
(the ANC's armed wing) and was crucial in recruiting and sending 
young people out the country for military training." 
  He said Mr Motsoaledi's experiences should inspire young 
people to know that an ordinary person without education could 
pull himself up by his bootstraps to assume the stature of a 
national figure. 
  Among those gathered at the stadium to pay their last 
respects were former prison mates Pan Africanist Congress 
President Clarence Makwetu, ANC stalwart Walter Sisulu, First 
Deputy Preisdent Thabo Mbeki and human rights lawyer George 
Bizos.

<F P=106> [By Paul Stober] </F>
  [Text] A powerful team is assembling in the office of State 
President Nelson Mandela to drive the ANC's Reconstruction and 
Development Programme (RDP). Although the composition and 
priorities of the new president's office are still under 
discussion, it is clear the building of the new South Africa 
will be high on its agenda and will receive Mandela's personal 
attention. 
  Said the recently appointed director general of the 
President's Office, Jakes Gerwel: "I can't presume for the 
president, but he will most likely be interested in the RDP and 
nation-building." 
  The choice of Gerwel director general is a clear indication 
of Mandela's personal commitment to ensuring old government 
structures change and the new government delivers. As rector of 
the University of the Western Cape for the seven years, Gerwel 
has first-hand experience of the difficulties of turning 
apartheid institutions around. He understands the problems the 
new government will encounter from its constituencies as well as 
those with other agendas. As director general, Gerwel will be 
heading the administration of the office and making further 
appointments. How effective the office will be depends largely 
on the style and priorities of Mandela and the people staffing 
his office. 
  Others tipped for positions in the president's office are 
Rivonia trialist Ahmed Kathrada -- who was squeezed out of the 
cabinet to make room for smaller parties -- as parliamentary 
liaison, and human rights lawyer Fink Haysom as a constitutional 
and legal adviser. 
  Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo, who will be 
overseeing 
the implementation of the RDP, will also operate from the 
President's Office. It is likely all ministries affected by the 
RDP will have to report to Naidoo, who will monitor the progress 
of the programme. 
  The ANC's Women's Emancipation Committee has proposed the 
new 
president establish a cabinet committee, under his office, to 
ensure the advancement of women in government. There is little 
doubt the proposal will be accepted. 
  Mandela is expected soon to announce five projects aimed at 
providing visible examples of the new government's commitment to 
improving the living standards of the poor. The projects will 
address the needs of those displaced by violence; of children; 
and the provision of facilities to townships. 
  Those involved say the idea behind putting key development 
projects into the president's office is to give them clout and 
place them where the president can oversee them.

  [Text] Mmabatho May 21 SAPA -- North West Executive 
Commitee member Rocky Malebana Metsing said on Saturday his 
administration would not hesitate to confiscate land, without 
compensation, from farmers who allowed AWB [Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement] activities on 
their farms, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
news reports. 
  Addressing a meeting at Bapong near Brits on Saturday Mr 
Metsing, whose portfolio is agriculture, said the government 
would not allow farm land to be used for storing weapons or for 
training members of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging's military 
wing. 
  Referring to people who were forceably removed from their 
land under apartheid laws, he said the state would do all in its 
power to ensure they got their land back.

  [Text] The integration of 30,000 soldiers, including 
Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing; 
(MK]) and Azanian People's Liberation Army [APLA] members, into 
the SA National Defence Force [SANDF] is a key priority of 
Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise During the next few years. 
  The integration will cost 1 billion rand for one year alone. 
"In order to integrate them successfully, we've got to train 
them and bring them up to equal standard," Modise said. 
  "This is another way of affirmative action, giving those who 
did not have the opportunity to catch up with those who had all 
the opportunities." 
  In an interview yesterday, Modise said the British army 
would 
play a role in overseeing their training and would also 
participate in adjudicating the integration. 
  The integration of MK, APLA and other former homelands 
armies 
would inflate the size of the SANDF initially, but the standing 
force would finally consist of between 67,000 and 70,000 
soldiers. 
  "Naturally people will be very concerned about what happens 
to those who are going to be rationalised," he said. 
  "We are looking at the creation of a service brigade." 
  Those who will lose their places in the SANDF will be given 
vocational training to prepare them for civilian life. 
  Modise said the SANDF would no longer play a policing role 
inside the country once stability was restored. He said the 
police, assisted by the community, should be able to cope. 
  He also ruled out the possibility of a military role outside 
the country. "We have our own problems," he said. "I don't 
think we are ready for that role. 
  "We are still in the process of reorganising our army and 
building it." 
  Regarding speculation about the SANDF intervening in Rwanda, 
he said: "We have not been approached and, even if we are 
approached, we won't accept. 
  "You cannot play a peacekeeping role where there is 
conflict. 
  "The conflicting parties must first agree and only then can 
a 
peace-keeping role be played."

  [Text] Although the mantle of power sits on Joe Modise's 
broad shoulders as snugly as his new tailor-made suit, the 
atmosphere in the new Defence Minister's office twangs with 
tension. Mr Modise's minders are twitchy. Nothing is certain. 
Civil servants are walking on eggshells to preserve their jobs. 
  The process of educating the minister has barely begun. 
Although he sat on the Transitional Executive Council's defence 
sub- committee, Mr Modise must be schooled before he is quizzed 
and tested in public. "Don't question him too deeply," whispers 
an aide as we enter the L-shaped office on the fourth floor of 
the Armscor building, east of Pretoria. 
  The advice is as unnecessary as it is unwelcome. Mr Modise 
is no stranger to hard questions. He has bitten the bullet many 
times. His orders to MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the 
Nation; ANC military wing] risked cadres' lives and wrought 
death and destruction in apartheid South Africa. But, like the 
thousand of guerrilla footsoldiers, Mr Modise led as commander 
of Umkhonto we Sizwe, he is still being integrated into the new 
defence force. 
  Mr Modise, 64, is bright-eyed and ardent. He speaks 
carefully. Careers and multi-million-rand empires sit balanced 
on his comments and decisions. 
  His immediate priorities are to establish a civilian 
department of defence and scrutinise the defence accounts for 
any "prunings" that will enable the SANDF [South African 
National Defense Force] to take on new responsibilities for 
integration without pushing the current R[Rand]9.3-billion 
budget above R10-billion next year. 
  Mr Modise says details of plans that will effectively draw 
the teeth of the generals by putting responsibility for military 
policy- making, funding and personnel under civilian control 
will be announced "within days". "If we are going to break with 
the past, we must make the Ministry of Defence a civilian 
apparatus that is accountable to Parliament," he says. 
  While Mr Modise refuses to discuss names, Lieutenant-General 
Pierre Steyn, the SADF [South African Defense Force] second-in- 
command "Mr Clean" who took early retirement late last year, is 
a favoured candidate for Secretary of State for Defence. He 
would have equal status with the Chief of the Defence Force who 
will retain operational control. 
  On the matter of appointments, Mr Modise says he cannot 
explain why he has no deputy, a post that was mooted for MK and 
SACP [South African Communist Party] firebrand Ronnie Kasrils. 
  "I have been asking that question myself," says Mr Modise. 
"Defence is a huge task. It is too much for one man. I am 
seeing it from the inside now. 
  "I have raised it with the deputy president and he cannot 
answer, so I will ask President Mandela why I can't have a 
deputy." 
  As expected, Mr Modise is disbanding the National 
Peace-keeping Force [NKF] ending the misery of uncertainty for 
the "blue berets", the controversial force integrating SADF, MK, 
SAP [South African Police] and homeland troops that he helped 
establish. Members are being returned to the units from which 
they were seconded. 
  Refusing to join the chorus crowing over the hastily-trained 
and rashly-deployed peacekeepers' failure, Mr Modise blames part 
of the fiasco on a "reluctance" by the SADF and SAP to 
wholeheartedly support the force. 
  "Now that the situation is normalising, the police must do 
this work of law and order, and the army must go back to 
barracks. 
  "I don't see any reason for the NPKF," says Mr Modise. 
  The NPKF is estimated to have cost about R240-million. Axing 
it now leaves more than R120-million to be recouped from its 
budget. Anything that can be saved is a bonus: the cost of 
integrating more than 30,000 soldiers from MK and the homeland 
armies into the SANDF, followed by the inevitable pay-offs for 
retrenchments to rationalise the force below 100,000 is likely 
to add more than R1-billion a year to the defence bill. 
  "Such a sensitive subject," Mr Modise says with a wince. It 
is clear that in the next round of cuts, jobs as well as 
treasured projects will be lost. It is not a policy of savings 
at any cost, however. Mr Modise supports the Navy's 
R1.2-billion bid to acquire four corvettes to restore its 
blue-water patrol and anti-submarine capability. 
  He sees the porject fitting into the ANC Reconstruction and 
Development Programme (RDP) by creating jobs in the equipping of 
"green hulls" bought overseas. The project also ensures the 
protection of South Africa's marine resources. 
  Caught between his ministerial responsibility to champion 
the 
best interests of the SANDF and Armscor [Armaments Corporation 
of South Africa] in cabinet and the ANC's obligations to better 
citizens' lives, Mr Modise plays down the conflict inherent in 
his new job. 
  Long dubbed a hawk, Mr Modise sees South Africa's 
multi-billion- rand arms industry as an irreplaceable source of 
skills, jobs and income for the RDP. "There is no 
contradiction. Morally the ANC is bound by the RDP to create 
jobs for people and if the defence budget is kept where it is 
and the arms embargo is lifted, jobs are going to be created," 
he says. 
  As far as Mr Modise is concerned, the lifting of the UN 
Security Council arms embargo, now openly disregarded, is but a 
fomarlity. "We called for the embargo because of apartheid and 
if we call for it to be lifted anybody opposing that will have 
to come with good reasons. We cannot impose it on ourselves," 
he says. 
  Another major step towards normality will come with the 
imminent return and integration of 2,500 MK cadres who have been 
trained in Tanzania.

<F P=106> [By Bronwen Jones] </F>
  [Text] The biggest thing Mr Joe Slovo has ever built is a 
sand-castle. Now, as Minister of Housing, he's moving on to 
grander schemes as he aims to oversee the construction of 
several million houses. Asked why he got the job, he's 
embarrassed, but jokes: "Maybe because I've got a pretty face." 
  Drawing on a short, slim cigar, his tone turns serious: "I 
took what I was asked to do. I feel honoured that I've been 
chosen for this. Housing is the most important element in the 
socio-economic development of a country." 
  He explains that for every 1 million rand invested in 
housing, 120 jobs are created -- five times better than the 
employment benefit of investing in, for example, textiles. 
Housing creates a consumer market for electrical goods and 
there is accompanying development of roads and water systems. 
"It has a multiplier effect, in a way no other sector has," say 
Mr Slovo. 
  He spend his first weeks as minister talking to the 
country's 
captains of industry, the Council for Construction in South 
Africa and all the bankers and mortgage lenders. He told them 
new housing must form viable communities in places where there 
is easy access to jobs, health care, education and social 
ammenities. 
  He says each householder needs a permanent residential 
structure, secure tenure, privacy protection against the 
elements, potable water, adequate sanitary facilities and waste 
disposal and electricity. 
  His priority is affordable housing for the very poor, with 
the government's subsidy scheme aimed at people who earn R2,500 
a month or less. Provision will also be made for the homeless 
and jobless by the creation of rental housing stock. 
  Unemployed people's ability to pay rent depends on a 
still-to-be designed system of social welfare that will provide 
the basic minimums of life. Mr Slovo says: "The whole 
reconstruction and development programme will have to be 
co-ordinated with housing as a key element." 
  Big ideas are difficult to carry out without skilled people 
and Mr Slovo is angry about the current level of builder 
training. He says: "The Building Industries Federation of 
South Africa is only producing about 500 people a year." 
  He will immediately raise the R20-million annual training 
budget, which comes from a levy on employers, to R200-million. 
  Mr Slovo says 10,000 men and women must be trained in 
building skills in the next two to three years. To do this, the 
R1.6-billion housing budget must be increased, and probably the 
employers' levy too. 
  In the past five years, the annual average was 23,991 new 
houses built. Mr Slovo is looking at 370,000 houses a year. He 
estimates that at the end of the first year of the new 
government, there will be 100,000 new houses; the next year 
double that, and in three years, up to the 370,000 average. 
  Included in housing strategies is a plan to increase the 
population density in some areas. While tower blocks are 
unlikely, new dwellings will include three to five-storey blocks 
of flats. 
  In the coming months, the housing ministry will put together 
financial and other infrastructures needed to start building. 
  The mortgage indemnity scheme is expected to end business' 
reluctance to invest in housing, and banks are collaborating to 
form the National Housing Bank. 
  The minister predicts training will start to produce enough 
labour for a visible thrust to the housing programme in about 
six months. 
  Mr Slovo is hugely proud of his portfolio and the new 
government. He says: "For 50 years I've been involved in the 
struggle for political and economic liberation. Now the 
challenge is to deliver up that liberation."

  [Text] The MPLA-PT [Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party] government continues with its murderous 
policy against civilians in National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA]-controlled areas of northern 
Angola. On 10 May MPLA-PT fighter bombers dropped chemical 
bombs over M'Banza Congo, killing five women and eight children. 
A church was destroyed. Dozens of people are still missing. 
  Meanwhile, intense clashes have been reported in Ebo region 
of Cuanza Sul Province with the People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] suffering setbacks. UNITA forces 
seized 15 hand grenades, 31 60-mm mortar rounds, and 22 82-mm 
mortar rounds in clashes over the past few hours. Our forces 
captured FAPLA soldier Frederico Quintas, born in Sumbe. He is 
being questioned.

  [Text] Reports from Lesotho say gunfire echoed overnight 
around the capital Maseru as a crisis sparked by a police strike 
entered its 12th day today. Sporadic shooting was heard late 
yesterday and early today. The crisis deepened yesterday when 
talks between the government, the striking police, prison 
officers, and the official opposition broke down. Prime 
minister, Mr. Ntsu Mokhehle has rejected police demands for a 
60-percent pay rise, and said the country cannot afford it. The 
opposition Basotho National Party walked out of a meeting with 
the government yesterday after Mr. Mokhehle accused the 
opposition of being involved in the police strike. 
  South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu is in Maseru at the 
invitation of church leaders in a bid to mediate in the dispute.

  [Text] The Honorable Minister of Information and 
Broadcasting, Mr. Mpho Malie, has appealed to the Basotho nation 
to work hard to strive for peace, stability, reconciliation, and 
social development. 
  In a statement released today the minister said it was of 
paramount importance at this critical time that the entire 
Basotho nation should join hands and strive to combat all acts 
of sabotage which were aimed at frustrating Lesotho's democracy. 
He said the acts of lawlessness and crime perpetrated by 
criminal offenders were not aimed at destabilizing the ruling 
Basotholand Congress Party, BCP, but were instead aimed at 
causing national instability and the frustration of the 
democratic process. 
  Mr. Malie said it was necessary to project tolerance and 
respect for one another among the people of Lesotho and that 
further bloodshed in Lesotho should not be allowed to take 
place. The minister said it was unfortunate that political 
gatherings by the main opposition Basotho National Party, BNP, 
and reports by its official newspaper (Mothlanka) left much to 
be desired. This, together with utterances by some of the 
leadership of the BNP, could have disastrous effects. 
  Mr. Malie condemned the acts of abduction of people and 
misuse of government property, such as vehicles, by the striking 
police and said such acts were detrimental to the economic, 
social, and political stability of the country. The acts 
condemned by the minister included the brutal killing of the BCP 
youth leader, (Selabalo Mathie), the abduction of the principal 
secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and 
some police officers, and the erection of road blocks. 
  The minister extended his appreciation to members of the 
Lesotho army who had responded promptly in dealing with the 
rampant lawlessness and the instability in some parts of the 
country.

  [Text] Striking police in Lesotho abducted Information 
Minister Mpho Malie from his car at gunpoint today and took him 
away for interrogation. Diplomats said Mr. Malie, who is also 
the acting finance minister, was [word indistinct] after he made 
a hardline statement on state radio on Sunday critical of the 
strike by police and prison guards now in its third week. A 
Western diplomat quoted the police mutineers as saying that the 
minister had been taken for interrogation. His whereabouts were 
not immediately known. 
  Some 2,500 of the country's 3,000 police have been on strike 
for 60-percent wage increases and other benefits since May 9th. 
They were joined by many of the country's prison guards, with 
senior officers keeping the jails operating. 
  Another cabinet minister, Mines Minister Monyane Moleleki 
fled to South Africa last Thursday, apparently in fear for his 
life. He vanished a day before he was due to host the annual 
meeting of mine ministers of SADC [Southern African Development 
Community] attended by South Africa for the first time. The 
meeting went ahed without him. 
  Diplomats said Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle called a meeting 
of the Defense Council after Mr. Malie's abduction, but there 
was no word on what he had decided.

  Reports said the Lesotho Government responded by saying

  The country's defence force has been deployed to prevent 
plundering. There have been incidents because there were too few

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The police strike in Lesotho is now into its third 
week and it is developing into something of a political crisis. 
Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle has accused the opposition Basotho 
National Party, the BNP, of being involved in the strike, which 
has spread to include junior prison wardens. Similar claims 
surfaced during the army pay dispute earlier this year. It all 
seems to stem from the elections last March, in which the BNP 
were comprehensively defeated. Today, a planned meeting between 
Mokhehle and the BNP leader Everistus Sekonyana failed to get 
off the ground and the acting finance minister, whose 
predecessor was killed last month, was kidnapped at gun point by 
angry policemen. On the line to Maseru Jeremy Skeet asked Mr. 
Sekonyane what relations were like between himself and the prime 
minister. 
  [Begin recording] [Sekonyane] They are certainly not the 
best 
relations one would wish they were. If the leadership was on 
both sides [words indistinct] which exist into good relations, I 
always believe that if the leadership is well disposed [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Skeet] Now, you are the leader of the BNP, are you disposed 
to good relations? 
  [Sekonyane] Well, I have to be, you know, by now I ought to 
know that you cannot run a modern state without being well 
disposed to accommodating other views, even if those views are 
different from yours. 
  [Skeet] So, you blame the prime minister, Mokhehle, for the 
bad relations between you and him? 
  [Sekonyane] I have learned that in life you don't start by 
blaming, you start by encouraging your opponent, you know, to 
get into a situation where you can be able to minimize your 
differences, or bury them. If you can't bury them, at least 
minimize and concentrate on the profits. 
  [Skeet] But, what are the major issues that separate your 
two 
parties? 
  [Sekonyane] Well, the major issues really are ... [changers 
thought] it is not a question of the major issues, it is a 
question of action, you know. There is no love lost, you know, 
between the two parties for more than 20 years and, you know, we 
have to build on that, and it is not easy. There is no way in 
life, you have got to find each other, you have got to talk to 
each other. 
  [Skeet] Now, your approach sounds very conciliatory, but 
there are those people who accuse you of, one stirring up 
trouble, and now stirring up trouble in the police force, and 
they are on strike. 
  [Sekonyane] You know, I once said to somebody, I said if I 
were that influential, I better be the prime minister. It is a 
very, very funny thing that, you know, I have got a a magic wand 
and people do what I want them to do, and yet I am not in that 
position. 
  [Skeet] But the police force used to be somewhat say, a 
branch of your party, the BNP, and now they are on strike. How 
much influence have you in the police force? 
  [Sekonyane] Well, you know, this is not so. It is very, very 
easy when people want to [word indistinct] through propaganda. 
They forget that we were ousted by the army in 1986. 
  [Skeet] But we are talking about the police here Mr. 
Sekonyana. I will just ask you, how close are you to the police 
force? 
  [Sekonyane] No, no, we are not close to the police force. It 
is a professional police force and as far as anybody really who 
knows Lesotho, the police were never really that much 
politicized, I really do not believe so. Anybody who is here 
knows that fact. [end recording]

  [Text] The honorable minister of foreign affairs, Mr. 
Molapo Qhobela, gave a wide ranging review of Lesotho's foreign 
policy when he introduced [as heard] his vote to the Committee 
of Supply in the National Assembly this afternoon. The minister 
announced the closure of the embassy in Maputo and the opening 
of a new mission in Cairo, and the closure of the High 
Commission in Nairobi, and the opening of a new one in Addis 
Ababa, Ethiopia. 
  The Mozambican mission was opened at the time when Lesotho 
needed a sea outlet, when relations between Lesotho and South 
Africa were unfavorable. It had now served its purpose. 
  Mr. Qhobela said the High Commission in Kenya had been 
established for political reasons and had also served its 
purpose. This mission will be transferred to Addis Ababa, which 
is the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity, and 
several specialized agencies of the United Nations. The 
relocation of the Nairobi mission will benefit Lesotho in many 
ways because of the importance of Addis Ababa as a center of 
African diplomacy and international relations through the United 
Nations system. 
  On relations with Taiwan, the minister said the Government 
of 
Lesotho was compelled to sever relations with the country after 
a visiting Taiwanese Government mission offered bribes to four 
Lesotho cabinet ministers. The mission was also requested to 
leave Lesotho. 
  Mr. Qhobela announced that Lesotho had established 
diplomatic 
ties with the People's Republic of China during his visit to 
Beijing last month. Agreement was arranged between the 
governments of Lesotho and China for financial and technical 
assistance for Lesotho. 
  The minister also announced that major changes in the 
diplomatic service will take place soon when officials of the 
Lesotho missions abroad will be recalled at the end of their 
service abroad. This was a routine exercise in the diplomatic 
service. Mr. Qhobela said much money would be required to 
effect the transfers of the diplomatic staff concerned.

  [Text] Malawi's new President Bakili Muluzi and his United 
Democratic Front, the UDF, have lost little time flexing their 
muscles after ending the Malawi Congress Party, MCP's, 30 years 
in power in last week's elections. Directors of state-owned 
corporations have been sacked, most are seen as political 
appointees sympathetic to ex-President Banda, but it looks like 
there is going to be a delay before the election result can be 
finalized. From Blantyre Rachel Rawlings reports: 
  There is a question mark over all five seats in Nsanje 
District, which was said to have been owned by Dr. Banda's 
Malawi Congress Party. The results in three will stand because 
there has been no special complaint received by the electoral 
commission, but the other two, which include that of MCP Vice 
President Gwanda Chakwamba have been declared void. A number of 
people including the powerful local chief Tengani, said to be a 
close associate of Mr. Chakwamba, are being taken to court over 
the matter. 
  Meanwhile, former President Banda has been given until the 
end of the month to move out of Sanjika palace here in Blantyre. 
It it rumored he will move into another house in Blantyre which 
was also used as an official presidential residence, but is in 
fact Dr. Banda's personal property. It is just one of a number 
of large houses he owned personally, which the government paid 
him to use as official residences. Civil servants here are 
awaiting confirmation of their new bosses as President Muluzi 
makes his ministerial appointments. A large framed picture of 
Dr. Banda still hangs in the entrance to the building which 
houses the office of the president and Cabinet. It was a 
requirement to have his portrait in public places. Some shop 
owners have taken the pictures down, but others still remain.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Today is just the second day of Bakili Muluzi's 
presidency, he was sworn-in on Saturday [22 May]. Putting 
together a working majority in Parliament looks like being his 
first big political test. According to the official figures 
published yesterday, his United Democratic Front [UDF] is just a 
handful of seats short of an outright majority, and it looks as 
if a coalition government is on the cards. On the line to 
Blantyre, Mary Harper asked the UDF secretary general, Harry 
Thompson, what they plan to do about it. 
  [Begin recording] [Thompson] What we are going to do now is, 
we are having a meeting today with the Aford [Alliance for 
Democracy] people, we will be listening to what they have to say 
to us, and take matters up from there. We are prepared to go 
into government even with a minority Parliament. 
  [Harper] And are you going to ask them to form an alliance 
with you in Parliament? 
  [Thompson] Well, we want to hear what it is that they want 
to 
say to us first. 
  [Harper] They must have told you already. 
  [Thompson] No, they didn't. They haven't told us. They are 
responding to an announcement made by our president when he had 
the victory speech to say that he was prepared to work with 
anybody who wants to work with us. 
  [Harper] And what about the MCP [Malawi Congress Party], 
have 
they approached you, or have you approached them? 
  [Thompson] No, they have not approached us, and I do not 
believe that we would work with them. I mean, we have been 
fighting them, and it would be foolish for us to go back and try 
and form an alliance, then we are getting back to the one party 
system again. 
  [Harper] But your relationship with Aford has hardly been 
particularly smooth. Over the past few months you have been 
fighting each other quite bitterly during the election campaign. 
  [Thompson] Yes, it was a bit of bruising and full of 
mudslinging. That is why we are rather saying, let us hear what 
Aford has to say to us. It may very well be that they will say 
that no, that was a battle, that was during the time of war, or 
[word indistinct], but now that it is over, in the interest of 
the nation, what have they got to offer us, what is it that they 
would like to talk to us about? 
  [Harper] Now, there is some concern that the UDF is 
basically 
a southern party. 
  [Thompson] I wouldn't go so far as to say it is 
southern-based. We have got some 15 or so seats in the central 
region, and I think that by the time our president announces the 
cabinet, it will be a cabinet of Malawians rather than regional 
people. 
  [Harper] Can you give any indication of who might be in this 
cabinet? 
  [Thompson] No, I cannot. I am afraid, you know, whatever I 
say would be guesswork at this stage. 
  [Harper] Are you planning to invite any opposition members 
into the cabinet? 
  [Thompson] That is the possibility, yes. 
  [Harper] And when is the president expected to announce his 
new cabinet? 
  [Thompson] The earliest will be tomorrow. [end recording]

  [Text] The Egle Party has urged opposition parties in Ghana 
to show political maturity even if they differ politically so 
that they may be accorded respect. This is contained in a 
statement issued in Accra and signed by the co-chairman of the 
party, Dr. Ako-Brew, congratulating President Nelson Mandela of 
South Africa and the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, for ensuring successful elections in their 
country. 
  The Egle Party also congratulates the outgoing president of 
Malawi, Dr. Kamuzu Banda, for conceding defeat in his country's 
presidential elections. According to the statement, the 
examples of South Africa and Malawi should be a light to other 
African countries where opposition parties, unable to accept 
defeat in a free and fair election, have resorted to verbal and 
physical violence to achieve political power. 
  The statement said whilst the NPP [New Patriotic Party] sent 
congratulatory messages to political party leaders in South 
Africa, who have made true dialogue a cornerstone of their 
politics, the same party has backed out of dialogue here at 
home. The statement said having failed to participate in 
elections which would have given it a presence in parliament, 
the NPP is doing everything it can to obstruct and discourage 
investments, undermine and discredit the government, and sow 
seeds of discord in the country. Whilst reminding the NPP of 
the proverb that charity begins at home, the statement urges all 
political parties to prevent the events in Liberia, Burundi, 
Rwanda, Somalia, and Angola from happening in Ghana.

  [Excerpt] President Charles Gankay Taylor has described as 
irresponsible recent utterances by the United Nations Observer 
Mission in Liberia, that the Liberia Council of State has the 
authority to appoint heads of public corporations and autonomous 
agencies. President Taylor said such statements have the 
tendency of bringing about renewed problems in the peace process. 
  The former NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly] 
government president said the United Nations has nothing to do 
with politics, and should stay out of Liberian politics. 
President Taylor said it is clear, although not explicitly 
stated in the Cotonou Accord, that the leaders of the three 
parties to the Liberian conflict will appoint ministers and 
other officials of government. He said it was predicated upon 
an agreement among the leaders of the parties that led to the 
allocation of cabinet posts. 
  President Taylor emphasized that it was out of the intent of 
the leaders that all positions in government are filled, saying 
discussions among the leaders are an addendum to Cotonou. He 
stressed that whatever discussions are held among the leaders, 
with the intent of arriving at certain decisions, must be 
considered an addendum to the Cotonou Accord, and any attempt to 
do otherwise will not be accepted. 
  President Taylor said the leaders of the various parties, in 
an attempt to avoid any delays in the transitional process, 
allowed the government to be seated in order to facilitate the 
speedy implementation of the disarmament process and the holding 
of free and fair general and presidential elections. President 
Taylor, in referring to the LNTG [Liberia National Transitional 
Government], gave an analogy, saying the LNTG is the birth of 
the union of three parties, which brought forth what he called a 
whole human being, with a head and other parts of the body.

  [Excerpt] In our newscasts yesterday, we reported the 
creation in Mali of a movement called (Ganda Koi), a Songhai 
word meaning masters of the land. The movement was created in 
reaction to acts of violence perpetrated by Tuareg rebels 
against members of the black community in northern Mali. The 
community has, therefore, decided to assume responsibility for 
its own security. Boubacar Guidado Toure, a spokesman for 
(Ganda Koi), elaborates on the objectives of the movement: 
  [Begin recording] [Toure] The movement is not meant to 
harass 
or harm the people, but to restore peace in northern Mali 
because the government is incapable of restoring peace there. 
Since the signing of the national pact, no day has gone by 
without attacks taking place or vehicles being taken away from 
their owners. Each time we are told that the perpetrators of 
those acts are armed groups. We know that plans for these 
attacks are hatched here in Bamako. We have, therefore, created 
the movement to stop such attacks. We will use the same means 
the rebels are using. 
  [Unidenfied correspondent] What do you mean? 
  [Toure] I mean that we are prepared to take up arms and 
fight 
them. 
  [Correspondent] So, do you have weapons? 
  [Toure] Yes, we have weapons. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, officials of the Unified Movement and Front of 
Azaouad [MFUA] say they do not understand the real motivation 
behind the creation of (Ganda Koi), but stress that they are 
prepared to fight those who will attack them. Speaking to our 
correspondent Djibrill Mbodj, MFUA spokesman Ag Alhassane 
denounced any attempt likely to plunge Mali into civil war.

  [Text] Lagos, May 23 (AFP) -- Only a trickle of Nigerians 
went to register Monday [23 May] in elections to a 
constitutional conference organised by the military regime amid 
boycott calls by pro-democracy campaigners, reports across the 
country said. 
  At several polling stations in Lagos, the commercial capital 
inhabited by some six million people, nobody at all had 
registered in the first three hours after the polls opened, 
while at others visited by AFP, fewer than a score of names were 
recorded. 
  After registration, the election proper began at noon (1100 
GMT), with voters expected to stand behind the portrait of the 
candidate of their choice in a controversial "open ballot" 
system. 
  The aim Monday was to choose electoral colleges in each of 
Nigeria's 30 states and the federal capital territory Abuja, 
which would in their turn, next Saturday, elect 273 delegates to 
the conference, which the regime has said will chart Nigeria's 
political future. 
  Pro-democracy movements, including a powerful group known as 
Middle Belt Forum consisting of prominent politicians and other 
figures in central states, have dismissed the vote as a 
"charade" aimed at perpetuating military dictatorship. 
  They asked junta leader General Sani Abacha to invite, by 
May 
31, the presumed winner of presidential elections annulled by 
the military last year, tycoon Moshood Abiola, to form a 
government or face mass protests. 
  The Campaign for Democracy, a coalition of some 40 
pro-democracy and human rights organisations, has also warned 
that it would try "physically" to block the vote and called for 
a boycott of the conference. 
  The junta, which plans itself to appoint 96 people to the 
conference, won the support at the weekend from a group of 
traditional chiefs in the ethnic Yoruba heartland in the 
southwest, Abiola's home region. 
  The Yoruba rulers said they would back the government 
conference in June on condition that the annullment of last 
year's presidential poll be part of the agenda. 
  Sources reached by AFP in major cities in other parts of the 
country reported widespread apathy about the poll.

satisfaction with the conduct of today's elections. He told 
newsmen after visiting some polling stations in Abuja that the 
exercise was generally peaceful in the country. Mr. Mba said 
reports so far received from states show that the turnout for 
the elections was impressive while there has not been any report 
of electoral malpractices. The chairman said he was 
particularly delighted that the exercise started and ended on 
schedule. A Radio Nigeria Network correspondent reports that 
the four-hour tour took the chairman to Abaje, Gwagwalada, 
Karimu, and Abuja municipal areas.

  [Text] Lagos, May 23 (AFP) -- At least 10 pro-democracy 
activists were arrested in Lagos Monday [23 May] during voting 
for a constitutional conference proposed by the military regime, 
a human rights group said. 
  The detainees included Tokunbo Afikuyomi, a special 
assistant 
to foreign minister Babagana Kingibe, Bola Tinubu, a former 
senator, and Olusegun Maiyegun, a former president of the Lagos 
University students' union, the Committee for the Defence of 
Human Rights said. 
  It added that on Sunday in Port Harcourt, the capital of 
southeastern Rivers state, a minority rights advocate, Ken Saro- 
Wiwa, was also arrested. Press reports said he was arrested in 
connection with four murders. 
  A former president of an association of Nigerian authors, he 
was to have taken part in Monday's election as a representative 
of the Ogoni people, a minority group in the state. They have 
over the years complained of marginalisation and fraud by oil 
companies operating there. 
  In another statement, Beko Ransome-Kuti, the national 
chairman of the Campaign for Democracy, an umbrella grouping of 
about 40 pro- democracy and human rights organisations, 
commended Nigerians for what he called their boycott of the 
election. 
  The boycott, he said, was the "unanimous verdict" of all 
Nigerians that a successful election would remain a "mirage" 
until the results of last year's vote, annulled by the military, 
are released. 
  Now that Nigerians have boycotted Monday's election, he 
urged 
the regime of General Sani Abacha to resign by May 31 to avert 
"a national catastrophe."

  [Text] Lagos, 23 May (PANA) -- Four prominent leaders of 
the Ogoni community in southeastern Nigeria have been reported 
killed in political violence connected with Monday's [23 May] 
national constitutional conference election. Reports reaching 
Lagos Monday from Port Harcourt, capital of south eastern state 
of Rivers, said the four were killed on Saturday in a leadership 
tussle for delegate slots for the June-December conference. 
  State military administrator, Lieutenant Colonel Dauda Komo, 
named those killed to include Albert Badey, a former secretary 
to the state military government and Edward Kobani, a former 
commissioner and prominent politician in the state. The others 
were Samuel Orage, also an ex-commissioner and his brother 
Theophilus Orage. 
  Komo said the incident took place at Giokonkoo, the 
ancestral 
home of the Gokana people in Ogoni. He said that security 
reports indicated that the assailants after murdering the four, 
took their bodies in a car to a nearby forest and burnt the 
corpses. the administrator pledged that those who committed the 
crime would be brought to book. 
  Meanwhile, the president of the Movement for the Survival of 
the Ogoni People (MOSOP), Ken Saro-Wiwa, has been reported 
arrested for alleged violation of rules governing the 
constitutional conference. Saro-Wiwa, who has been in the 
forefront of the campaign for Ogoni self-determination because 
of what MOSOP called "exploitation" of the oil-rich community by 
oil companies and successive Nigerian governments, was reported 
arrested at the weekend following his campaign to be elected a 
constitutional conference delegate.

  [Text] Home affairs minister and IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, has denied that the 
transfer of 1.2 million hectares of land to King Goodwill 
Zwelithini shortly before the election had played a role in the 
IFP's participation in the elections. He was answering 
journalists' questions in Cape Town shortly before the first 
cabinet sitting. He said the legislation adopted by Parliament 
had persuaded him to participate in the elections. 
  Dr. Buthelezi said he had held talks lasting an 
hour-and-a-half with President Mandela, during which he had 
explained that the land had been transferred to the KwaZulu 
government three years ago. The KwaZulu government had decided 
to transfer the land to communities. Dr. Buthelezi insisted that 
there was nothing new or secret about the transaction. 
  President Mandela said after the talks that he was satisfied 
with the outcome and that the matter would be referred to the 
IFP and the ANC.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 22 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] said on Sunday there was no reason to believe 
that King Goodwill Zwelithini would abuse his powers regarding 
the Ingonyama [King's] Land Trust. PAC economic director Sipho 
Shabalala said in a statement that "the land is to be held in 
trust for the born and unborn citizens" of South Africa. 
  He said the transfer of land to the Ingonyama trust did not 
represent the privatisation of land, which the PAC rejected.

  [Text] Parliament May 24 SAPA -- Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, 
secretary-general of the African National Congress, was elected 
to chair South Africa's Constitutional Assembly at the first 
joint sitting of the National Assembly and Senate on Tuesday. 
  Mr Ramaphosa, 42, will oversee the two-year process which is 
to draw up the country's final constitution. He was the ANC's 
chief constitutional negotiator, a former security detainee and 
headed the National Union of Mineworkers before becoming 
prominently involved with ANC-aligned politics in the late 1980s. 
  According to ANC Chief Whip Mr Arnold Stofile, Mr Ramaphosa 
would act as a "political rudder", ensuring that the principles 
in the interim constitution and those of the ANC were adhered to. 
  The constitutional assembly is convened by a joint sitting 
of 
the 400-member National Assembly and 90-seat Senate. 
  Former Minister of Manpower Mr Leon Wessels was elected 
deputy chairman of the Constitutional Assembly on Tuesday. His 
nomination, by Minister of Environment Affairs Dr. Dawie de 
Villiers, was unopposed.

  [Text] Parliament May 24 SAPA -- Newly elected chairman of 
South Africa's Constitutional Assembly Mr Cyril Ramaphosa 
dedicated himself on Tuesday to the "monumental" task of 
drafting the new constitution that would have to reinforce 
reconstruction and development aspirations, and help achieve 
lasting peace. 
  ANC Secretary-General Mr Ramaphosa, 41, who was elected 
unopposed by a joint sitting of the 400-member National Assembly 
and the 90 member Senate, will oversee the two-year process 
which is to draw up the country's final constitution. Former 
minister of manpower, National Party MP Mr Leon Wessels, was 
elected his deputy. Neither nomination was opposed. 
  Speaking to the 490-member Assembly immediately after his 
unopposed election, Mr Ramaphosa said he was eager to get down 
to the task. 
  When Senate President Mr Kobie Coetsee, who oversaw the 
election, announced that Mr Ramaphosa had been duly elected, all 
the members of the Assembly, except for a handful of Freedom 
Front MPs, rose to their feet and applauded. 
  After being escorted to the presiding officer's seat, Mr 
Ramaphosa shook Mr Coetsee's hand and took the chair. 
  He told the Assembly that its inaugural meeting was the 
culmination of many bitter struggles waged by "the mass of our 
people" to install democratic rule in South Africa. 
  It was also the embodiment of a vision now shared by many 
South Africans that the final constitution should be drafted by 
an elected body of men and women to realise the long-cherished 
dream that the people should govern. 
  The Constitutional Assembly gave the country prestige and 
raised hopes that the task of broadening and deepening democracy 
in South Africa would indeed be accomplished. 
  The Assembly had a historic and important task, Mr Ramaphosa 
said. The constitution would have to reinforce the aspirations 
of all South Africans on the matters of reconstruction and 
development, would have to enhance national unity and 
reconciliation, and help achieve lasting peace. "It is a 
document that must spell out the fundamental principles by which 
we as South Africans want to be governed," he said. 
  He regarded it as a great honour as well as a formidable 
challenge to be elected to chair the Assembly charged with such 
an important task, and undertook to perform his duties in a 
spirit of fairness and openness so that South Africans as a 
whole could see that their parliamentarians were involved in a 
truly transparent process. 
  He trusted the Assembly's deliberations would be marked by a 
spirit of co-operation and good humour. Drafting the document 
would entail tough political bargaining, but the quality of the 
final product would depend on the intellectual and emotional 
balance, the farsightedness and wisdom each of the Assembly's 
members were able to bring to the task. "I trust we will not be 
found wanting," he said. Those who elected the MPs had reposed 
a great deal of trust in them. "We must not and cannot fail," 
he said. 
  Immediately after Mr Ramaphosa's speech, ANC Chief Whip Mr 
Arnold Stofile moved without opposition that Mr Ramaphosa be 
empowered to appoint a rules committee for the Assembly, and 
that he chair the committee. 
  Mr Ramaphosa dissolved the Assembly "until further notice". 
  He was the ANC's chief constitutional negotiator, a former 
security detainee, and headed the National Union of Mineworkers 
before becoming prominently involved with ANC-aligned politics 
in the late 1980s.

<F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town May 23 SAPA -- The cabinet on Monday 
played down political differences arising from the KwaZulu land 
transfer, presenting a united front on the day before President 
Nelson Mandela's historic address to South Africa's first 
all-race Parliament. Meeting at Tuynhuys from about 11AM until 
well into the evening, the cabinet did not allow the land 
transfer issue to develop into a controversy that could detract 
from Mr Mandela's address. 
  A statement issued by Deputy Presidents Thabo Mbeki and F W 
de Klerk said cabinet approached the discussion "with a view to 
reaching a consensus that will contribute to the process of 
nation-building and reconciliation". The statement said all the 
parties reaffirmed their commitment to such an approach. 
  A cabinet committee was formed comprising Land Affairs 
Minister Derek Hanekom and Ministers Kader Asmal, Roelf Meyer 
and Ben Ngubane. 
  Both Mr Meyer and Dr Ngubane were central to the 
constitutional negotiations process which formed the political 
background to the passage of the Ingonyama [King's] Trust Act. 
The legislation ceded 1.2 million hectares of communal land to 
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. 
  The committee will report on the background and reasons for 
the establishment of the trust, examine and report on the 
implications of the act and make recommendations to the cabinet. 
It will pay attention to security of tenure of residents in the 
prescribed area, the functioning of a land claims court should 
disputes arise, and the impact on a future land reform programme. 
  The land issue was discussed in cabinet following a meeting 
between President Mandela and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi. After the meeting, Chief Buthelezi denied that the 
land transfer had anything to do with securing his Inkatha 
Freedom Party's participation in the elections in April. 
  However, the issue was resolved in less than two hours as 
cabinet members turned their attention to Tuesday's opening of 
Parliament and in particular Mr Mandela's speech to the nation. 
Mr Mandela's speech is expected to set out his vision of how the 
government of national unity will address South Africa's 
political and socio-economic challenges in its five years of 
existence. 
  Mr Mandela will speak after a ceremonial drive through 
central Cape Town along streets lined with troops. There will be 
a flypast and a 21-gun salute as he takes the salute from the 
guard of honour. 
  Parliamentary staff were making last-minute preparations for 
the opening and getting the historic house of Parliament into 
shape for the event. 
  Cabinet colleagues apparently discussed aspects of Mr 
Mandela's speech at length and made inputs. 
  Mr Mandela's staff were not giving away many clues, but he 
is 
expected to once again stress the importance of reconciliation. 
"Reconciliation is important where there is a lot of 
uncertainty," said a source close to the president's office. 
  "Our approach in general terms is that reconciliation and 
social upliftment go together. We can never have true 
reconciliation if the conditions of the people remain the same." 
  The source said Mr Mandela's speech would deal with the main 
themes of the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Mr 
Mandela would point to the need to make certain immediate 
changes. These could involve the education system and a job 
creation programme. 
  Mr Mandela will also be seeking to reassure potential 
foreign 
investors that strict fiscal discipline will be maintained in 
the government's approach to reconstruction and development.

  [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- Former South African 
Defence Force [SADF] Chief General Georg Meiring has been 
appointed chief of the new South African National Defence Force 
[SANDF]. 
  Announcing the five-year appointment on Tuesday, Minister of 
Defence Mr Joe Modise said that the task of building a 
legitimate, credible and fully representative NDF that would 
enjoy the support and co-operation of all South Africans would 
rest on the general's shoulders. 
  Mr Modise warned that the defence force would become 
"inadequate" if it faced any further cuts, and said a regional 
defence accord could play an important role in discouraging 
internal instability, such as that now troubling Lesotho. "It 
is my sincere wish that under the command of Gen Meiring the 
SANDF will do its best towards reconciliation, upliftment, 
prosperity and peace in our country." 
  The government was also looking at forming a veterans' 
brigade to absorb people who had left the armed forces as a 
result of rationalisation. 
  Mr Modise said the final size of a rationalised defence 
force 
would be between 67,000 and 70,000 people. This would be 
adequate to defend the country, but South Africa would "also be 
looking at the region", and to becoming part of defence and 
security arrangements on the subcontinent. 
  Integration of non-statutory forces such as former Umkhonto 
we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] guerrillas 
would have some effect on the coming budget. "I think initially 
the budget will have to accept this group that's coming, but 
after rationalisation -- because rationalisation also takes into 
account an affordable army -- there has to be a ceiling 
somewhere. The core we have got is the barest we could arrive 
at. Below that it will be inadequate." 
  It had to be remembered that the defence force would play a 
major role in the RDP [Reconstruction and Development Plan] 
through job creation in concerns such as weapons manufacturers. 
  One of the defence force's major concerns would be social 
upliftment. It had the capacity and knowhow to play a 
meaningful role in the RDP. "So money coming into the defence 
force is money well spent," he said. 
  Asked when South Africa would start to take part in 
organisation of African unity peacekeeping exercises, he said 
this was difficult to say. The defence force would "start at 
home" and see what the needs of the region -- rather than the 
continent -- were. 
  It would want to reassure its neighbours that they were 
looking at security and defence in the same light, and that they 
should not feel threatened by the size of South Africa's army. 
  Problems in neighbouring states such as Angola and 
Mozambique 
would hopefully be resolved in the near future: Mozambique was 
preparing for an election, and there were signals that Angolan 
negotiators might sign an accord by early June. "We think this 
will provide the climate to address regional security end 
defence," he said. 
  South Africa would avoid being drawn into other countries' 
internal problems, but "those who are inclined to be 
problematic" would have to know they were dealing with a much 
wider form of defence. 
  He was not suggesting South Africa would go poking its nose 
into its neighbours' affairs, but those who wanted to create 
instability -- such as that affecting Lesotho -- would have to 
think twice in future because such instability could affect the 
entire region. 
  The non-statutory forces absorbed into the NDF would start 
training in the next few days. These forces had not enjoyed the 
privileges and modern facilities of former SADF troops, and 
would have to be empowered before they could compete as equals. 
  The fact that the training would be overseen by neutral 
British advisers would ensure that the final product would 
satisfy all parties. 
  Asked to comment on the possible prosecution of white South 
Africans who were called up for service over the election period 
and did not report for duty, he replied: "Why do you want to 
start off with controversial questions? Do you want to set me 
against the old system?" 
  ANC policy was very clear: The organisation was opposed to 
conscription and would prefer a voluntary defence force. 
  In times of war, when the security of the entire nation was 
affected, things were different and necessary steps would be 
taken to ensure the nation was protected.

<F P=106> [By Pierre Claassen, political correspondent] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- Parliament will adjourn for 
almost a month at the end of this week following a three-day 
debate on the state president's opening speech on Tuesday. 
  Nonetheless, various committees will start with open 
sittings 
soon to consider legislation due to be tabled for debate 
immediately after Parliament reconvenes for the budget on June 
22. 
  Parliament will then be in session for little over two weeks 
during which it will debate the budget before once more going 
into recess for the July winter holidays. 
  The budget vote committee stage will commence once 
Parliament 
reconvenes in August. 
  This unusual programme underscores the clear break with past 
parliamentary schedules while upholding the practice of breaking 
for the winter recess. 
  According to government and parliamentary sources, debates 
on 
the new government's first legislation are due to start the day 
after Finance Minister Derek Keys introduces his 1994/95 budget. 
  The budget will be referred to committee for the required 
seven-day "sweat" period immediately after being introduced. 
Then the National Assembly will start considering other 
legislation. 
  The Senate, empowered to review legislation passed by the 
National Assembly, will in all probability start debating bills 
a day later. 
  It is uncertain when the Constitutional Assembly (the 
National Assembly and Senate sitting jointly) will convene for 
its first working plenary. These sittings are expected to be 
rare and primarily aimed at ratifying work agreed to by a number 
of specialised committees to be set up within the next week or 
so. 
  Officials said on Tuesday there was some urgency to get the 
committees functioning to prepare enough work for Parliament to 
continue sitting until the budget debate itself started. This 
would require enough legislation to occupy the house for little 
over a week. 
  The various committees will now function in open session as 
opposed to the closed-door deliberations which characterised 
law-making in the past. The public and press will now have 
direct access to debates on bills unless a committee chooses to 
go into closed session.

<F P=106> [Report by Carmel Rickard] </F>
  [Text] Like many of his colleagues on the new cabinet, 
Justice Minister Dullar Omar has first-hand experience of 
apartheid's harsh security laws. In fact, one of the most 
important cases on detention and government powers to infringe 
individual rights, bears his name. In 1985, while he was still 
a member of the Cape Bar, Mr Omar was detained under the State 
of Emergency and brought an unsuccessful application for his 
release. 
  The resulting Appeal Court judgment in Omar vs the State 
President was one of the low points in Emergency case law. 
However, when the Cape Supreme Court first heard the case, Cape 
Judge President Gerald Friedman dissented from his two fellow 
judges. He filed a decision which human rights lawyers say will 
go down as one of the great judgments in a particularly dark 
period for the rule of law in this country. 
  Following the Appellate Division decision against him, Mr 
Omar spent two months in emergency detention. Earlier that year 
he had already been detained for two months under security laws, 
with only 10 days' freedom before being detained a second time. 
  The experience has left him a fierce opponent of detention. 
He says it has a devastating effect on detainees and their 
families and dehumanises those who "do the detaining". 
  Mr Omar wants to use his portfolio to transform the justice 
system, making it respectable and legitimate in the eyes of 
society, so that it can help create and maintain a human rights 
culture. 
  "The first priority in achieving this aim is to implement 
the 
new constitution. The Judicial Service Commission and the 
Constitutional Court must be set up, along with the Human Rights 
Commission, the Commission on Gender Equality and the public 
protector's office. All are urgent and we must help get them 
going." 
  "Fortunately, the department began working on these matters 
even before I got here, so we will be able later this month to 
present to the first sitting of Parliament any legislation 
needed to establish these bodies." 
  Giving his personal view on capital punishment, he says that 
as a member of the ANC and the National Association of 
Democratic Lawyers, he has long been opposed to the death 
penalty. 
  On the problem of how to make the judiciary better reflect 
society's composition, he hints that he might consider borrowing 
from the Continental system, in which potential judges are 
selected early in their career and given specialist training. 
  Mr Omar was admitted as an attorney in 1960 and as an 
advocate in 1982 and he has previously gone on record supporting 
fusion of the two professions. In his new capacity, however, he 
wants any decision on this issue to be taken with community 
needs in mind. "The yardstick is improved access to justice and 
reduced expense for people who need to go to court." 
  He wants lawyers countrywide to become involved in deciding 
the issue. But not only lawyers. "It is important that the 
public also participates in this debate." 
  On the relationship between government and the 
Constitutional 
Court, he says that since World War 2 similar courts in Europe 
have played a "politico-constitutional" role. "But that does 
not mean they must descend into the political arena, and 
political parties must ensure that they respect the position of 
the Constitutional Court as standing above party politics." 
  All judicial officers, from magistrates to judges of the 
highest court, must take a new oath of office. Some legal 
activists have long supported the idea, saying it might help 
keep out judges or magistrates unable to identify with the 
values of a democratic society. The oath, however, is still a 
controversial issue with argument in legal circles both for and 
against. But Mr Omar favours the idea. He says taking the oath 
implies "the values underpinning the new constitution are part 
of your approach". 
  "This is exciting. It means that irrespective of the past, 
everybody is given an opportunity to become part of the new 
human rights culture and help promote it in their work." 
  His political life began at Trafalgar High School in Cape 
Town, when he joined a boycott of the Republic Festival in 1952. 
Eight years later, he had hardly opened the doors of his new 
legal practice when the whole PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] 
executive walked in and asked whether he would act for them. 
The next day they were all arrested. 
  That started a legal career acting for political trialists, 
and for prisoners on Robben Island which he visited several 
times a week to see clients. For many years he was a staunch 
member of the Unity Movement, only quitting at the time the 
United Democratic Front was formed. His decision to join the 
Congress movement was partly influenced by President Nelson 
Mandela whose attorney he had become by that stage.

<F P=106> [Report by Cas St Leger] </F>
  [Text] New Health Minister Dr Nkosazana Zuma backs freedom 
of choice on issues ranging from abortion to patients preferring 
private hospitals. She was party to the ANC National Health 
Plan released this week, which promotes the liberation of 
abortion laws. 
  However, Dr Zuma says: "Any law should respect the right of 
people not to have a termination of pregnancy if they do not 
believe in it. 
  "Health workers should not be made to perform that 
termination if it is against their morals and religious beliefs. 
  "People feel it may be un-Christian. As a Christian, I find 
it difficult to be judgmental of women wanting a termination. 
  "That is something they have to sort out with their God. It 
is not for me, as a doctor, to judge them." 
  Dr Zuma moved into her slightly shabby ministerial suite 
high 
in the Civitas Building in Pretoria on Monday. Brightening the 
meagre decorations were the South African flag and a bouquet of 
flowers sent by the dean of the University of Pretoria. 
  Already immersed in a formidable schedule and en route to 
Cape Town for the opening of Parliament, Dr Zuma paused for a 
second to wonder about the fate of the flowers. "I was 
touched," she said. 
  Dr Zuma's first task will be to guide the National Health 
System [NHS], which will unify South Africa's fragmented health 
services, through Parliament. She intends retaining and 
supporting the valuable parts of the old health service -- like 
research and academic hospitals -- and rebuild the entire health 
edifice around primary health care. 
  "I don't want the impression created that once we go the 
primary health care way, academic medicine and research goes out 
of the window," said Dr Zuma. 
  "I see both primary health care and academic medicine as 
essential to the health service." 
  While there would have to be "some rationalisation," Dr Zuma 
said she believed anxieties that academics would become poor 
relations in the new health service were unfounded. Dr Zuma's 
priority will be the well-being of South Africa's children. 
  Everything else -- from streamlining inefficient provincial 
hospitals, to nudging the private sector to co-operate, to 
setting up free medial care for those who need it and 
establishing a primary health care network -- will follow. 
  She intends the changes -- at least in child care, with free 
medical services for under-sixes -- to be visible by the end of 
this year, depending on legislation. "Children are the first 
priority. If you have a nation of stunted, malnourished 
individuals, children whose brains have not grown to their full 
potential, then you can't hope to have a nation that will be 
prosperous and able to compete with the rest of the world ..." 
  If this mother and professional woman has one pang about her 
new post, it is that she has had to leave her four children and 
one step-child, aged between five and 12, behind in Durban. 
  She is confident the money for restructuring health services 
-- about R[Rand]2-billion or 14 percent of the Budget -- will be 
found. 
  "Unless we're saying that the changes taking place should 
only be meaningful for me as a minister and not for anybody 
else, then we have to find the money. The restructuring has to 
happen." 
  Maritzburg-born Dr Zuma, 45, was raised at Pholela in 
Zululand. She matriculated from Adam's Mission in Amanzimtoti 
and went on to study at Durban's medical school. In exile with 
her husband, ANC deputy secretary-general Jacob Zuma, she 
completed her MB [Bachelor of Medicine] ChB [Bachelor of 
Surgery] degree at Bristol University and received a diploma in 
tropical child health from the University of Liverpool. 
  She then worked at the Mbabane Government Hospital in 
Swaziland and at the ANC health department in Lusaka before 
joining the Medical Research Council in Natal in 1991 to 
research AIDS and maternal and child health. 
  Academic hospitals -- now called academic complexes to 
include their teaching function -- are regarded as national 
resources. They will fall directly under the NHS, rather than 
under provinces. "They should be seen as national assets shared 
across provinces," Dr Zuma said. 
  One possible way of streamling services would be for 
specialised operations like heart transplants to take place in 
one centre.

<F P=106> [Report by Edyth Bulbring] </F>
  [Text] He sat with arms folded, occasionally nodding with 
approval or narrowing bloodshot-weary eyes as he listened to a 
briefing on the new water policy. When Minister without 
Portfolio Jay Naidoo rose to leave, his colleague, Water and 
Forestry Minister Kader Asmal, remarked to him: "Our door is 
always open to you. We will be knocking on your door." 
  The comment speaks volumes about Mr Naidoo's status in the 
new government and the relationship he will have with his 
colleagues in the cabinet. Armed with the budget and a red pen, 
Mr Naidoo has the full backing of President Nelson Mandela to 
intervene in every area of government. No door will be shut to 
him and his team operating form the floor above Mr Mandela's 
office in the Union Buildings. 
  "I may be a minister without portfolio, but it does not mean 
I do not have a job," Mr Naidoo said this week. His task is to 
ensure that the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme 
(RDP) -- a plan to provide millions of jobs, 10 years free 
education, health care for all, electricity, housing and water 
on a massive scale -- is implemented. 
  He has to bring together all the various departments into 
one 
coherent programme. 
  It is a job that involves "a lot of talking" with ministers, 
the provincial governments and with civil society. Crucial to 
the success of his task is to build a partnership between the 
government, the private sector and the labour movement in a 
common national endeavour to better the lives of the people, he 
says. To carry out his task, he will have a transition team in 
his office and a cabinet sub-committee of ministers crucial to 
the RDP -- those from labour, trade and industry, finance, 
housing, transport, telecommunications, provincial affairs, 
health, education and water -- who will thrash out the 
programme's priorities before reaching the cabinet. 
  In implementing the RDP, Mr Naidoo is constrained only by 
four factors: he must maintain a macro-economic balance; retain 
fiscal discipline; he cannot fuel inflation; and he must be 
guided by the principle of not raising the level of taxation. 
He is the minister that will work closet with Finance Minister 
Derek Keys. 
  His task seems impossible given the constraints and the 
limited amount of money at his disposal. But Mr Naidoo is 
contemptuous of scare stories of R80-billion [rand] in addition 
to budgetary allocations being spent on the RDP by the end of 
five years, the spectre of a debt-trap and rocketing inflation. 
  "The RDP is not an add-on programme. We are not talking 
about a new list of demands and adding on (to the Budget)." 
Instead, he says, each department's budget will be examined to 
see whether it fits the new priorities. 
  "Finance is not the problem. The government, having resolved 
(the RDP), made the funds available and set up a plan -- the 
acid test is getting the plan working on the ground." 
  And Mr Naidoo believes it is nonsense that the government 
cannot deliver housing, infrastructure and services. "There are 
communities out there that want the stuff. We have to break 
through the red tape of bureaucracy, go down and deal directly 
with the communities," he says. 
  He talks of using the unions, business expertise and other 
non- governmental oragnisations to do this in the absence of 
effective delivery mechanisms. 
  "It takes a lot of organisation but it does not come 
overnight. That is what frustrates me. We can do all of this. 
There are people on the ground ready to do it. What is 
stopping us from doing it?" 
  It is all a question of reorientating the government 
departments towards effective delivery of services, establishing 
local government structures and being ruthless with a 
bureaucracy that absorbs more than it delivers, he says. "Part 
of my work is moving towards greater efficiency. Within five to 
10 years, the framework in which the new government can operate 
will have been achieved and there will be no reason to have an 
RDP team." 
  There are four sources of funds for the RDP. The first 
comprises "wedges" from the Budget which will increase each 
year. One scenario, released by the National Institute for 
Economic Policy this week, is that R80-billion from the Budget 
will be spent on the RDP in the next five years. The other 
sources are: development aid; donations from the private sector; 
and resources from non governmental organisations. 
  Then there are always the "windfalls" that Mr Naidoo says he 
will have no reservation about using -- selling off assets like 
the "macho white glory projects of the past" that are not 
directly linked to delivering the RDP. 
  He is also confident that with the restoration of services, 
the rent and services boycotts will come to an end. "Within 
these constraints, we are going to put forward a realistic plan, 
and we are confident that we have one. We have worked through 
mechanisms of harnessing resources, especially with the private 
sector, organised labour and other stakeholders. We are quite 
confident that we have drawn them into a real partnership," he 
says. 
  The first small signs of the RDP will be visible in the 
Budget that will be presented on June 22. 
  Work has already been done with Mr Keys, former State 
Expenditure Minister Ami Venter, Deputy Finance Minister Alec 
Erwin and Mr Naidoo over the past several months on identifying 
sources of funding in the Budget. They have examined 
expenditure patterns and carefully gone through the budgets of 
all the departments, arranging them in the order of priority for 
the RDP and assessing what could be achieved in this year's 
Budget. 
  They have taken their red pens and marked areas of saving, 
and put a line through those projects which are no longer 
priorities. This money will be spend on RDP priorities in the 
first year. 
  "We are not so naive as to think that we are going to 
achieve 
everything that we talked about in the RDP this year. We have 
to prioritise, but we have a clear idea of what we can achieve 
in the first year," he says. 
  They will particularly focus on "kick-starting" the RDP, 
beginning with very visible programmes that will indicate to the 
electorate that the new government is different from the old. 
  These priorities are programmes in the areas of education, 
jobs, health and infrastructure. The plan will be discussed at 
the cabinet meeting tomorrow. 
  "It is only in the 95/96 Budget that we will begin in a more 
systematic way to reorganise expenditure along the lines of 
expanded priorities," Mr Naidoo added. 
  It is the beginning of a reorganisation process that will 
take at least 10 years to complete. By then, Mr Naidoo says: 
"The entire Budget will be one of reconstruction and 
development. That is the ultimate goal. 
  "The government will be the epitome of the RDP, operating 
under the mandate of the people and serving the people. My job 
is an interim function -- to get the government to become what 
it is supposed to be."

safety and security Jessie Duarte on Monday said the police 
service would take affirmative action on its racial make-up and 
revamp its public image. 
  Addressing the PWV provincial legislature at Nasrec, near 
Soweto, she said all senior officers were white males but this 
would be rectified as soon as possible. 
  Improving the image of the police, which she said had been 
the frontline of the National Party for the past 40 years, would 
require suggestions from the public. It would never be said 
again that policemen had searched a house without a warrant, 
sworn at the public or failed to respond to complaints. 
  An advocate was investigating allegations police had 
tortured 
detainees in the Vaal Triangle. 
  Police stations would be equipped to deal with women who had 
been sexually abused.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roelf Meyer, provincial affairs and </F>
constitutional development minister, and Deputy Minister Valli 
Moosa by SABC announcer Freek Robinson, in the Cape Town studio, 
on the "Agenda" program -- live; italicized passages in English] 
  [Text] [Robinson] Good evening and welcome from the Cape. 
There is a hive of activity here, even on this Sunday, as the 
new members of Parliament prepare for this week's first historic 
sitting of South Africa's first legislative body, elected by all 
the people in the country. All 400 members of the National 
Assembly in Parliament have been inaugurated, as well as the 90 
members of the Senate, on Friday. Now the work can begin. But 
how will the new Parliament function? That is what we are 
discussing tonight. With me are two ministers of the government 
of national unity, Mr. Roelf Meyer, the minister of provincial 
affairs and constitutional development, and then also the deputy 
minister of this department, Mr. Mohammed Valli Moosa. Let us 
begin with this portfolio and its name, which is a little 
different to the one you held previously. Mr. Meyer, how will 
you divide the functions between the two of you? 
  [Meyer] Well, let me first say that the department, as it 
was 
previously known, namely Constitutional Development, of course 
dealt with the management of the negotiating process and the 
creation of the new constitution as we know it now. From this 
point the main aim is support for the constitution writing body, 
that is the two houses of Parliament who have joint tasks and 
who have to oversee the creation of the so-called final 
constitution. I believe that our department will primarily have 
a support function, to ensure the completion of that task. 
Concerning the working relationship between my colleague Valli 
and myself, I want to say that we -- as was my approach in the 
past -- will work together as a team. We do not have specific 
divisions of functions between us and over the past week we 
already met with advisers in the department. It will not be any 
different from the type of cooperation we experienced in the 
previous dispensation, over the past few years. 
  [Robinson] But you are from different parties. Mr. 
Moosa, would you like to emphasize certain things more? Would 
you do that through your party or would you first like to find 
consensus with Mr. Meyer here before you go to Parliament with 
any suggestion? 
  [Moosa] Well, there's no denying that Mr. Meyer comes 
from a different party than myself and of course we have been 
elected by the .. [changes thought] Our parties have been 
elected by our constituencies because of the policies which we 
had and our policies are not exactly the same on all matters, 
but notwithstanding that, we have been the architects of the 
concept of the government of national unity, and I think the 
positions which Mr. Meyer and I are in at this point in time is 
an ideal position to give reality and meaning to the concept of 
government of national unity and it's for that reason that we 
really need to be working as a team. We've already agreed that 
we would work as a team and we have started doing that. 
  You must understand that the role of 
constitution-making, and the role of the department, and the 
role of government would be slightly different over the next two 
years as it was over the past few years. Over the past few 
years you had a situation which can be characterized as a 
conflict, on the one hand, between the government and various 
other groups, the ANC being the principle of those groups. At 
this point in time there isn't such a situation. You don't have 
a situation where the government of national unity is in 
conflict with one or other major political party as such and the 
main work of the debate about constitution-making will take 
place in the constitutional assembly, and for us as a department 
-- would be to facilitate and to give whatever backup we can 
give there in that sense, and of course our own party-political 
aspirations we will tend not to voice them within the department 
-- but in Parliament, of course, when I speak in Parliament, 
when Mr. Meyer speaks in Parliament he would be speaking on 
behalf of his party and he would articulate the viewpoint of his 
particular party which would be different from my viewpoint. I 
think we have had a discussion and we don't believe that that 
would in any way prejudice our ability to work as a team and 
fulfill the duties which the president has allocated to us. 
  [Robinson] Well let us come to the practical aspects of 
that, 
Mr. Meyer. The first thing that has to happen is this 
constitutional body -- as it is officially referred to in the 
constitution -- has to meet, that is the Senate in other words, 
and the National Assembly together -- these two bodies together 
must write the new constitution within the next two weeks. The 
first task is for this body to meet. When, specifically, will 
this happen? 
  [Meyer] This will happen on Tuesday morning, at 11 AM [0900 
GMT]. This will be a formality really. The constitution states 
that it must meet within a certain period from the first sitting 
of the Senate, this joint meeting ... 
  [Robinson interrupting] Can we just get clarity on this 
issue. The Parliament must meet in any event -- for its opening 
-- now if it meets for the first time then will that at the same 
time be the constitutional body or is that the Parliament? 
  [Meyer] I think one must differentiate between the two. When 
the National Assembly and the Senate meet on Tuesday, then they 
are meeting as the constitution writing body, and then they will 
meet to elect their own chairman to that relevant body. When 
Parliament meets at 2.15 PM [1215 GMT] the afternoon, to listen 
to the president's opening address, then it meets as a joint 
assembly of the National Assembly as well as the Senate. 
  [Robinson] In other words the Parliament? 
  [Meyer] In other words the Parliament, then as the two 
separate bodies, although the venue is the same and the people 
who are meeting are the same people. 
  [Robinson] Well, that's an interesting point, Mr. 
Moosa. There's been speculation in the press about the position 
of Mr. Ramaphosa. Would he, for instance, be a candidate for 
the chairmanship of that Constituent Assembly? 
  [Moosa] Well, what I would say is that the 
Constitutional Assembly, for us certainly as the ANC and I think 
for many other parties, has been one of the most important 
bodies that we have succeeded in creating as a result of the 
process of negotiations. It occupies a central position in the 
interim constitution and it has the massive task of finalizing a 
new constitution for this country, finalizing the boundaries of 
the regions, finalizing what the powers and functions of the 
provinces are going to be, finalizing the Bill of Rights and 
various other matters, and therefore, if I can speak for the 
ANC, we place a tremendous amount of weight on the 
Constitutional Assembly and you can be certain that the person 
we chose to be the chairperson of the Constitutional Assembly 
would be one of the most senior members of the ANC. I'm not in 
the ... [changes thought] I have just come from a caucus meeting 
now. I am not in a position to ... to .. you know, say it on 
the air, but I can assure you that it will certainly be reserved 
for one of the most respected people in the organization. 
  [Robinson] Mr. Meyer, we are used to this -- there are these 
negotiations between the National Party and the ANC -- for 
example, the speaker of Parliament is an ANC member, but the 
chairman of the Senate, the president of the Senate as he is 
called, is someone from the National Party. Who is actually 
going to sit as chairman of that Constituent Assembly? 
  [Meyer] I think it has been an arrangement between Mr. de 
Klerk and Mr. Mandela, namely that two of these posts -- the 
executive chairmanship, namely the speaker and the chairman of 
the constitution-making body would be filled by the ANC, and the 
Senate's presidency by the National Party. This is a prior 
arrangement and who these people are going to be will be left to 
both parties to decide. So at this stage it is the ANC's choice 
regarding that chairmanship. 
  May I just add something as regards the role of this body? 
It has a prescribed role. The constitution defines in detail 
what its task is going to be, and how it must carry out this 
role as regards the putting into place and the acceptance of the 
final constitution for South Africa. But at the same time one 
has to reiterate this for the sake of peace of mind, namely, 
that an extensive task regarding the putting into place of a 
future constitutional dispensation has already been finalized 
during the multiparty negotiations process which we had over the 
last three years. What is indeed needed now, of course, is to 
implement the existing constitution as it now stands in two 
ways. The one is to market it to the public at large, and the 
broader public must get involved in it, also through specific 
institutions and sectors of the... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] How? How? 
  [Meyer] Let us say the church community and the business 
community, for example, have a specific interest in the 
acceptance of the final constitution. 
  [Robinson] Can they get involved in committees, for 
instance, 
to come forward and give evidence? 
  [Meyer] That will have to be determined by the 
constitution-making body itself; in other words, it is not for 
us to prescribe. But the way I see it, there are specific ways 
whereby opportunities can be created to enable institutions from 
outside to give input in that regard, because what is the 
eventual objective? To my mind the objective is to see to it 
there is a broad involvement and acceptance of our future 
constitutional dispensation. The second is to take a look at 
specific technical aspects of this constitution. There are 
certain issues which come to mind and which have to be examined 
for further improvement; such as, for instance, the Bill of 
Fundamental Rights. Chapter 3 as it now stands in the current 
constitution and which deals with that aspect will, in my 
opinion, have to be improved further in its entirety. It is not 
complete enough, and I think that all the parties in the 
negotiation process have already indicated this. 
  From the point of view of the National Party we have already 
pinpointed certain issues which we would like emphasized and we 
are sure that the ANC has also indicated that they would like to 
have certain clauses expanded. In any case, there is a 
constitutional principle which states that the Bill of Rights 
must conform to all recognized universal fundamental rights. So 
we must maintain that criterion, and it will also be the 
constitutional court's task to decide whether the constitution 
meets that particular constitutional principle. There are other 
aspects as well. From the point of view of the National Party, 
we would like to see that the constitution be improved, also 
some of its federal characteristics, and we must determine to 
what extent it is necessary to improve it. And also other 
aspects such as the concept of a government of national unity. 
Our agreement is that this government of national unity should 
govern for five years, that is, until 1999. This means that the 
final constitution will have to undergo a change. And these are 
some of the aspects which we have to investigate and improve on. 
  [Robinson] Well, Mr. Moosa, would you foresee that 
the present constitution, the interim constitution, would be 
changed radically over the next two years? 
  [Moosa] Well, I think some aspects of the constitution 
have to change. As Mr. Meyer has said... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] What in particular, [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Moosa] Well, I don't think that I'm particularly, I'm 
having sleepless night about any particular aspect, but on the 
one hand, I think what has been said already -- all provisions 
concerning a government of national unity would have to be 
reviewed and they'll have to be up for discussion. That was a 
specific agreement for a period of five years. Whether you 
replace it, and what you replace it with, how you form the new 
executive after five years, what shape that government would 
take -- those are questions that will have to be answered. On... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] Even the possibility of 
continuing the government of national unity? 
  [Moosa] Well, I wouldn't like to preempt what the 
Constitutional Assembly is going to do, but most certainly from 
the ANC's side, our approach always has been that a government 
of national unity is a temporary measure in order to ensure that 
there is a smooth transition, and that we have never seen it as 
a permanent position as such. And then you must remember that 
it's the first time in this country that we are setting up the 
type of provincial governments that we have now in the 
constitution. None of us can say for certain as to how well 
that provincial dispensation is going to work in practice. Once 
we put it into practice, then there will be a need to amend the 
interim constitution in order to make it more workable, in order 
to make the system of provincial government more smooth. 
  We would also find, now that we have democratically 
elected provincial governments, and democratically elected 
premiers, those provincial governments may well want to demand 
additional powers. You must know in the past there were no real 
representatives of provinces at the multiparty negotiating 
table. Those who came from regional governments didn't really 
enjoy status because they were not regarded as democratic. So 
that would come under discussion, and we could well have a 
situation where the position of provinces are strengthened, but 
that is a possibility also that could emerge. 
  On the bill of rights, I would also agree. You know, 
there are very controversial and sensitive issues, like the 
abortion question. Now, the present bill of rights that we 
negotiated merely skirted around the issue simply because at the 
multiparty negotiations we didn't think we were in a position to 
legislate on that sort of question. It is a very fundamental 
question to many people, it can divide societies. On that kind 
of issue the Constitutional Assembly will have to encourage very 
broad debate in society, with all concerned groups, particularly 
the religious community, women's organizations also. And that 
whatever the new constitution says about that matter must 
reflect the dominant view in society. 
  [Robinson] We had initially planned to have a commercial 
break at this point, but I think we should continue with this 
discussion. Let us now go on to provincial government as Mr. 
Moosa has already mentioned that. Now, I want to refer to these 
points: first, the establishment of liaisons between the 
national government and provincial governments, and does the 
constitution make provision for a commission in the provincial 
government, Mr. Meyer? 
  [Meyer] The commission in provincial government could play a 
very important role. It could contribute towards development in 
the provincial government, and could also present important 
advise regarding communication between the central and 
provincial government. It can also play an important role, 
specifically in the constitution-making body, on how provincial 
government should develop in the future. So, the commission is 
an important body. The constitution specifically makes provision 
for establishing it, and this should be done during this coming 
week. The constitution specifically states that the commission 
should be set up within a month after the new constitution has 
been implemented. 
  [Robinson] Have you already appointed members for this 
commission? 
  [Meyer] My colleague and I have held joint consultations 
with 
the president on this matter and we are now in the process of 
consulting with other parties, and an interesting point is that 
members should be appointed from every province by the president 
after consultations, respectively, with the other premiers. So, 
in other words, it is important for joint consultations, and... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] To stop you there, how do these 
consultations with the premiers take place, over the telephone, 
or is there a specific body, I believe there is actually such a 
committee of premiers? 
  [Meyer] Not yet, so far. I will get back to that aspect, 
but before I get to it, there is the whole issue of consultation 
with the premiers: A colleague and I discussed if this should 
take place on the basis of consultation between parties, and 
when we have obtained the names from our respective provincial 
colleagues, we will get together for deliberations on this, and 
if we can reach a consensus, then we will make a recommendation 
to the president. 
  [Robinson] You say you have agreed to liaise at party level? 
That effectively means that Mr. Moosa here will consult with 
seven premiers, and you effectively only with one. Now who is 
going to liaise with Dr. Mdlalose in Kwazulu/Natal? 
  [Meyer] That is incidentally so, but at the same time you 
must remember that the National Party also has representatives 
in those provinces where the premiers are ANC members. So in 
other words, I also liaise with National Party representatives 
in those provinces, and we try to get the maximum possible 
consensus among us before a recommendation is made to the 
president in that regard. The final decision on the matter will 
rest with the president, but as in most cases -- and I think 
this is the tone that has already been set -- it takes place in 
the spirit of the government of national unity. This is the 
atmosphere and spirit fortunately in which liaison takes place 
in this specific instance. 
  But to return to the other aspect that you referred to on 
the 
issue of consulting with the premiers and a possible committee 
of premiers, it is being speculated that at the meeting of 
premiers this coming Wednesday here in the Cape, the president 
and the deputy president will be present, at least at the start 
of the meeting. The meeting will take place chiefly to discuss 
some of the common points which also constitute stumbling 
blocks, and have visibly come into being particularly with the 
phasing in of provincial governments, and with the issue of 
rationalization of administrations. We must remember that up to 
now we have had up to 17 different administrations, according to 
the old constitution. All those are being converted into one 
central administration, plus nine provincial administrations. 
And I personally think it leaves room for potential 
uncertainties and also confusion, because in the end it concerns 
those who occupy posts, and the provision of services to people. 
And all this we will have to try and sort out. For this reason, 
it has been decided to hold the meeting this coming Wednesday 
specifically with premiers here in the Cape. 
  [Robinson] Just on the question of being fair to all 
provinces, Mr. Moosa, would you in any way discriminate against 
the other provinces, Western Cape and Natal, that are not under 
the control of the ANC, because physically you are in a position 
to dish up the money. You could withhold money to those 
provinces. 
  [Moosa] Well, fortunately the constitution has very 
detailed provisions as to what the relationship between central 
government and provincial government should be. There are 
certain constitutionally entrenched powers which belong to the 
provinces. The only thing which we are working on at this point 
in time is how to transfer the administration and the executive 
authority for these powers to provinces. But they are entitled 
to certain powers, and that's in the constitution. As far as 
financial matters are concerned, there again are detailed 
provisions on that. There are also provisions for the 
establishment of a financial and fiscal commission on which all 
the provinces would be represented, and that financial and 
fiscal commission would do all the analysis and develop 
recommendations and proposals for central government as to what 
the allocations and budgetary requirements of the various 
provinces should be. But even apart from all of that, what you 
must remember is that as a government, as a government all of 
South Africa's people are our people. Whether they live in a 
province that's controlled by one party or another party is a 
separate matter as such. The reconstruction and development 
program is for all the people. The houses that are going to be 
built, or the electricity that would be provided must be 
provided as much for a province controlled by Tokyo Sexwale as a 
province which is controlled by Frank Mdlalose, and that is the 
policy of the government. 
  [Robinson] Just this -- there are two other bodies that 
I would quickly like to refer to because our time is running 
out. One is the Afrikaner Homeland Council. So how do you feel 
about this question now after the election, of providing for 
that, and looking into the matter of a volkstaat [homeland]? 
  [Moosa] Well, we had -- the one thing that you must 
know is that the government would, and the parties which are in 
the government would keep to their undertakings, and we had 
undertaken prior to the elections that we would enter into 
negotiations through this body called the Afrikaner Homeland 
Council on the question of a volkstaat. And one of the 
assessments that would now have to be made after the elections 
is what is the support base of those who say that there should 
be a volkstaat, where is the support base of that? And we would 
have to begin to look at the feasibility of that. So that's a 
matter that we would enter into negotiations with, quite 
honestly, with those who believe in a volkstaat, but I think 
that everybody would have to accept the realities of the 
democratic will of the people, and I think that the election 
results are a real good basis for us to take those negotiations 
hopefully to their conclusion in a fairly short space of time. 
  [Robinson] Thank you very much Mr. Meyer [as heard], in 
conclusion -- in a few seconds unfortunately -- we still have 
the council of traditional leaders. Just tell us briefly what 
they do specifically? 
  [Meyer] Bodies like that have been appointed to see to the 
interests of traditional communities on a national scale, and 
particularly of the highest in these communities, the so-called 
chiefs; to coordinate and to liaise, and this body has also been 
set up to make sure that this function can be fulfilled 
according to the prescriptions of the constitution. 
  [Robinson] Thank you Mr. Meyer, thank you Mr. Moosa.

  [Text] The minister in charge of broadcasting, Dr. Pallo 
Jordan, says the government will follow an arms-length approach 
with broadcasters. At the start of a two-day conference on the 
future of radio, Dr. Jordan said that in the past governments 
had too easily abused their links with broadcasters. An 
independent body such as the Independent Broadcasting Authority 
should regulate the industry. Mr. Jordan said the government 
would want to monitor and restrict any possible cross ownership 
of the media, but that the government will ensure that the 
airwaves were free.

<F P=106> [Report by Stefaans Bruemmer] </F>
  [Text] Whites, who were marginalised, banned, detained, 
jailed and forced into exile under the old regime, are moving 
into positions of power and influence in the new. To a far 
great extent than in other liberation movements on the 
subcontinent, whites played an important role in the fight 
against apartheid. They made a distinctive contribution in 
student politics, the trade unions and the legal sphere. During 
the 1950s and 1960s they were prominent in the South African 
Communist Party and its successor, the Congress of Democrats, 
and in the ANC's trade union arm, the South African Congress of 
Trade Unions. 
  White intellectuals and student activists again played a 
vital supporting role in the resurgence of black unionism in the 
1970s, and in the rise of the United Democratic Front a decade 
later. 
  Here are eight who, by historical irony, already hold or are 
on the threshold of high public office: 
<H5>  HALTON CHEADLE </H5>
  Tipped as the new director-general of manpower, Cheadle (44) 
is a lawyer with impeccable "struggle" credentials. After 
whetting his appetite for union affairs as a student on the 
University of Natal's Wages Commission, he became a national 
organiser for the Textile Workers' Industrial Union. His 
ground-breaking work in organising black workers in 1972 and 
1973 -- when the Industrial Conciliation Act did not recognise 
black labour unions -- earned him the wrath of the security 
police. "Anyone who organised black workers clearly constituted 
a threat to the state," says Cheadle. He had a five- year 
banning order slapped on him in 1974, but it lapsed after two 
years. 
  During his "house arrest" he completed a law degree with 
Unisa [University of South Africa]. Afterwards he joined the 
Centre for Applied Legal Studies at Wits [Witwatersrand 
University], where he still holds a teaching chair. 
  In the 1980s he started the legal firm Cheadle, Thompson 
&amp; 
Haysom with Nicholas Haysom in Johannesburg. "Hundreds" of 
labour cases and a number of human rights cases put Cheadle's 
firm on the legal map. 
  In 1985 Cheadle and his partners represented the Uitenhage 
community in the Kannemeyer Commission of Inquiry into the death 
of 21 marchers at the hands of police, and the following year 
there was an interdict against the police when Port Elizabeth 
district surgeon Dr Wendy Orr spilled the beans on police 
torture. That same year the firm's challenge against the 
second State of Emergency on behalf of a trade union grabbed 
headlines. 
  Cheadle made his mark on constitutional law last year when 
he 
served on the Ad Hoc Committee on Fundamental Rights at the 
World Trade Centre negotiations. 
  What motivates him? "Certainly not the money. I suppose 
the best is the people I work with. The people in the struggle 
are the most extraordinary people." On the director-generalship 
he says: "I am talking to people, but I like my life at the 
moment." 
<H5>  JOHN DANIELS </H5>
  A foreign affairs expert and professor of politics at the 
University of Durban-Westville, Daniels (50) seems a likely 
candidate for a top Department of Foreign Affairs position by 
virtue of his close connections to the ANC task group on foreign 
policy and his training of diplomats for the new order. 
  Daniels cut his anti-apartheid political teeth in the 
student 
movement. He says he came out of school a supporter of the 
United Party, but underwent a "radical political conversion 
through NUSAS [National Union of South African Students]. "For 
the first time I found myself working in a non-racial 
organisation." 
  He was president of the University of Natal-Pietermaritzburg 
SRC [Students Representative Council] in 1965 and vice-president 
of NUSAS the following year. He took over as NUSAS president 
when the incumbent, Ian Robertson, was banned. 
  He soon attracted the attention of authorities, who refused 
him a passport when he wanted to study overseas in 1967. In 
1968 he was re-elected NUSAS president, but things became too 
hot and he went into exile until 1991. He did a PhD in the 
United States and became a professor of political studies in 
Swaziland -- where his association with the ANC started. Swazi 
authorities deported him in 1985, after which he worked as a 
researcher in Holland and for a leftwing publisher in London. 
  On his return to South Africa he joined the Rhodes 
University 
department of politics, where he headed a diplomacy training 
programme. He moved to the University of Durban-Westville last 
year. 
  He says the area of international affairs may hold far fewer 
difficulties for the new government than domestic 
transformation. He expects pressures on the Reconstruction and 
Development Programme, which may mean a retreat on some 
promises. "I fear cynicism, bitterness and slow delivery." 
  President Nelson Mandela's "incredible international 
stature" 
will smooth the way for South Africa's reentry to the world 
arena, says Daniels, and the new government can play an 
important role in giving the Third World a greater voice in the 
United Nations. 
  Daniels says he is in two minds about the possibility of 
taking public office. "If offered a position in the Department 
of Foreign Affairs, I would seriously consider it, although I am 
also very committed to academic life." 
<H5>  ALEC ERWIN </H5>
  Erwin (48), an economist who made his career in the trade 
union movement, has been named deputy minister of finance in the 
new national cabinet. He is an ANC MP in the National Assembly. 
Like his contemporary Halton Cheadle, he graduated from Wages 
Commission to union involvement. 
  He helped found the Institute for Industrial Education in 
1973 and made his name as one of a number of whites who played a 
critical role in the reconstruction of the trade union movement 
after Sactu [South African Congress of Trade Unions] was smashed 
and forced into exile. 
  During a wave of bannings and detentions in the mid-1970s 
Erwin was put under surveillance, was targeted in police raids 
and had is passport withdrawn. 
  In 1979 Erwin became the first general secretary of the 
newly 
launched Federation of South African Trade Unions (FOSATU), 
which was to form the backbone, with the National Union of 
Mineworkers, of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions]. 
He served COSATU, and later the National Union of Metalworkers 
(Numsa) as education secretary. He became involved in ANC 
structures in Durban after the oragnisation's unbanning and 
represented COSATU on the National Economic Forum. 
  Erwin hopes for a constructive relation between labour and 
government, but "it is crucial the union movement maintains its 
independence and organisational strength." 

<H5>    DEREK HANEKOM </H5>
  Hanekom (41) was appointed minister of land affairs last 
week 
-- eight years after he walked from prison in Pretoria following 
a terrorism conviction. In 1990 he became co-ordinator of the 
ANC land and agricultural desk. 
  Hanekom matriculated from Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town and 
did his national service in Potchefstroom, after which he 
travelled and did assorted jobs -- including farming -- in 
Europe, America and Israel. 
  From 1978 to 1983 he was a dairy, poultry and vegetable 
farmer in the Magaliesberg, where he started facilitating 
linkages for the ANC. But he was arrested -- with his wife, 
Trish -- and sentenced to three years in jail. He served the 
full term. Trish, a Zimbabwean citizen, was later deported to 
Zimbabwe and Hanekom followed. He was appointed co-ordinator of 
the Popular History Trust in Harare. He returned in 1990 to 
take up the ANC position. 
<H5>  NICHOLAS "FINK" HAYSON </H5>
  "In another society my first concern may have been rugby, 
which is my passion," says Haysom. But "in South Africa it has 
been difficult to live a normal life while there are glaring 
inequalities and injustice". 
  Like his partner Cheadle at the labour and human rights law 
firm Cheadle, Thompson &amp; Haysom, Haysom has a long "struggle" 
track record and is likely to be the legal and constitutional 
advisor in Mandela's office. He is a human rights, 
constitutional, and security expert and ANC appointee to the 
Police Board established in terms of the National Peace Accord. 
  He was "something of a liberal even at school", and got 
caught up in progressive student politics at the University of 
Natal, where he was SRC vice-president from 1973 to 1975. In 
1977 he was elected SRC president at the University of Cape Town 
and president of NUSAS [National Union of South African 
Students]. 
  Haysom was detained without trial for short periods in 1976 
and 1980, and for about five months in 1981, when the government 
cracked down on the trade union movement. Like Cheadle he 
joined the Centre for Applied Legal Studies at Wits, where he is 
an associate professor. He is member of the ANC's committee on 
constitutional affairs and took part in the Codesa [Convention 
for a Democratic South Africa] and World Trade Centre 
negotiations. 
  Of the "new South Africa" he says: "It's exciting, but I'm 
also sure it's going to be difficult to transform a society and 
civil service that has worked in a particular culture of 
authoritarianism and militarism to one that is transparent." 
<H5>  JANET LOVE </H5>
  Once branded on police posters as "armed and dangerous", 
Love 
(38) made a rapid ascent to transitional structures after being 
granted indemnity three years ago -- her current position is 
deputy executive director of the Transitional Executive Council 
[TEC]. 
  Her political life started at Wits University, where she was 
elected to the SRC and the NUSAS executive in 1975. A year 
later she started working covertly for the ANC. She facilitated 
communication between ANC cadres outside the country and 
internally, and between banned people. 
  In 1978 Love left the country for "a short period that 
turned 
out to be 10 years". In Europe and Southern Africa she was 
involved with SACTU [South African Congress of Trade Unions] and 
was trained as an Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC 
military wing (MK]) guerrilla. 
  In 1987 she returned illegally and lived under a series of 
assumed identities, and took part in MK's Operation Vula. "In 
1990 the SAP [South African Police] got wind that I was here and 
put out a series of mug shots of me, saying I was 'armed and 
dangerous'." She spent a year on the run. 
  In June 1991 Love was granted indemnity, and the following 
year was elected to the ANC's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] regional executive, where she helped set up the 
Codesa negotiations. 
  As the TEC winds down, she has been mentioned as a possible 
appointee to the President's Office, but says nothing has been 
finalised. 
<H5>  CHARLIE NUPEN </H5>
  A lawyer and a big man ("Isn't it one of the ironies of life 
that he is called Charlie when he is about eight feet tall," 
quipped an IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] staffer), 
Nupen (43) shot to broad public attention as commissioner of the 
Independent Electoral Commission. 
  As NUSAS president in 1974 he led a campaign for the release 
of political prisoners such as Mandela and Walter Sisulu. For 
that he spent a year on trial in 1976, but was acquitted. After 
university he practised as a labour attorney in Cape Town and 
from 1980 to 1987 was an attorney with the Legal Resources 
Centre -- where he helped establish a jurisprudence in the 
Industrial Court. After that he was appointed national director 
of the Independent Mediation Service of South Africa. 
  Nupen says he is optimistic. "I'm incredibly pleased about 
the security situation now; that has been one of the most 
impressive aspects of the electoral process." 
  Economic development is predicated on stability, he says. ? 
"If (peace) can be sustained, it augurs incredibly well for 
investment, development and Reconstruction and Development 
Programme." 
  Nupen may consider another public office -- and there have 
been discussions around a Department of Manpower position -- but 
Independent Electoral Commission legislation precludes him from 
holding one for 18 months. 
<H5>  DR TIM WILSON </H5>
  Wilson (50), tipped for a senior Department of Health 
position, has a strong community health background, both as 
practitioner and as the ANC's health policy co-ordinator. 
Wilson's godfather was Professor Z.K. Matthews, ANC Cape leader 
in the 1940s, and his association with the ANC started at birth, 
he says. He kept the struggle in the family by marrying SACP 
[South African Communist Party] legend Braam Fischer's daughter, 
Ilse. 
  While Wilson was completing his medical studies in England 
his passport was withdrawn, presumably because of his 
association with ANC activists. He returned in 1970. "I was 
lucky only my passport was withdrawn. There were people who had 
it tougher than me," he says. 
  In the late 1970s he became involved in community health, 
and 
led a research project in Soweto. He was one of a group of 
doctors who took the South African Medical and Dental Council to 
court for its failure to censure doctors involved in the 
cover-up of Steve Biko's death. 
  In 1986 Wilson was appointed director of the Alexandra 
Health 
Centre, where he felt the brunt of informal repression. After 
he and other staffers refused to hand over records of patients 
to police, a series of arson attacks was launched against the 
centre. He moved into ANC health policy structures in 1990. 
  Wilson says first priority is to overcome the fragmentation 
of health services. When a unified health policy is introduced 
"we can raise the level of health care in this country, 
infinitely, with the current resources we have."

    [Editorial Report] PWV 
  Johannesburg SAPA in English at 1502 GMT on 21 May reports 
that "a 13-year-old schoolgirl was shot in the head and is in a 
critical condition after the car she was travelling in came 
under fire on the N1 freeway near Ennerdale on Saturday. The 
girl's father, Mr Monty Wilken, who was driving the car, told 
police he heard a shot and when he turned around he noticed that 
his daughter, Sylvia, was bleeding. The right-hand rear window 
of the car had been shattered."

shootout between policemen and suspected robbers in the 
crime-ridden area of Alrode on the East Rand. A suspect and two 
other policemen were wounded and one of the policemen is in 
critical condition in hospital. The incident happened after the 
police received information and erected a road block. A vehicle 
carrying between five and seven armed men crashed into the road 
block and shooting broke out. Most of the suspects escaped. An 
AK-47 rifle and three handguns were seized. In another incident

  [Text] Durban May 23 SAPA -- At least 11 people were killed 
in KwaZulu/Natal at the weekend, the South African Police [SAP] 
services reported on Monday. The deaths pushed the toll in the 
province to at least 459 since a state of emergency was declared 
there on March 31. In their latest report on Monday police said 
about 25 youths confronted a man they accused of practising 
witchcraft in Durban's Cato Crest. 
  His wife, Victoria Mduko, was stabbed in the shoulder but 
managed to escape with six other people. When she returned later 
she found the burned corpse of her husband. 
  Mr Mbongeni Mzobe, 37, was attacked and stabbed to death at 
a 
Mayville, Durban, shebeen after an argument on Saturday night. 
  Ms Buyi Mbanjwa, 22, was shot dead, allegedly by her 
policeman boyfriend after an argument in Himeville, near 
Pietermaritzburg, on Saturday. 
  And in Vryheid, Northern Natal, Mr Elias Kunene was shot 
dead, allegedly by a policeman following an argument on Saturday 
night. 
  In Montclair, Durban, the corpse of an unidentified man who 
had been hacked to death was found on Saturday, police said. 
  The bullet-riddled body of another unidentified man was 
found 
in Inanda, north of Durban, on Saturday morning, while the body 
of a man was found in the nearby Nhulswane River. He had been 
shot in the left eye. 
  In Stanger, on the North Coast, Mr Jabulani Mtembu was shot 
dead by unknown gunmen on Saturday night. 
  In Mtunzini, on the North Coast, Mr Amos Cebukulu was awoken 
on Saturday night by a knock on the door. Seeing that one of the 
men was armed, he fled and on his return found the body of his 
son. 
  Meanwhile, the Human Rights Committee said violence had 
"definitely decreased" but spokesman Linda McLean cautioned 
there was still dissatisfaction over the election results and 
concern over policing in the province. "We are still very 
worried about the violence in KwaZulu/Natal."

  [Text] Former Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs George 
Bartlett will soon resign form his post as head of the National 
Party [NP] in KwaZulu/Natal. He will stay on as a member of the 
executive council for agriculture in the provincial legislature. 
  Mr. Bartlett was sworn in last night [Wednesday] with six 
others in Pietermaritzburg by Judge Allan Howard, Justice 
President of KwaZulu/Natal. 
  He will resign as provincial leader at the NP's federal 
congress in Pietermaritzburg on 4 June. Danie Schutte will most 
probably succeed him. 
  Mr. Bartlett said last night that it was time for new blood 
in the party. "Renewal has always been one of the NP's strong 
points. I have been considering resigning for the past year. 
With the election now something of the past, this is the right 
thing to do. I am now 63 years old and it is time for a younger 
person to take over," he said.

<F P=106> [By Dirk van Zyl] </F>
  [Text] Cape Town May 22 SAPA -- Mr Tony Leon, appointed 
interim leader of the Democratic Party [DP] on Sunday, has 
pledged himself to promoting liberal democracy as the "salvation 
of South Africa". In his first press interview after he had 
beaten DP Federal Chairman Ken Andrew to the position, Mr Leon, 
37, told SAPA he also intended writing a letter to President 
Nelson Mandela on Monday, pledging the DP's support in principle 
for the African National Congress' Reconstruction and 
Development Programme [RDP] and for Mr Mandela's "very valued 
effort" at nation building. 
  But he stressed the RDP would only touch peoples' lives if 
it 
was sustainable and cost-effective. "At the moment it is a menu 
with a variable price list. We've got to create durable job 
opportunities, not just once-off job creation schemes," Mr Leon 
said. 
  He also believed Deputy President F W de Klerk should be 
called to the bar of Parliament to explain the "squalid" KwaZulu 
land deal. 
  Mr Leon said the DP could make a "very postive" contribution 
and the party had to "come into its own through glasnost 
(openness)". Total public accountability had to be applied in 
all facets of public life -- including the KwaZulu land deal. 
  Mr Leon said a second "acid test" facing South Africa in the 
immediate future was whether the judges of the Constitutional 
Court would be appointed through a process of public hearing. 
  Mr Leon added: "I also want to expand very rapidly and 
transcendingly the DP's base in South Africa. We have a rare 
opportunity to do so." 
  He said he was "humbled but challenged" by his leadership 
appointment. The election -- in the 75 member DP Federal Council 
-- had been "the most creative of all contests I've been in." 
  Mr Leon joined the Progressive Party youth wing at the age 
of 
11, was a Johannesburg city councillor at 29, and succeeded Mrs 
Helen Suzman as MP for Houghton in 1989 at the age of 32. 
  He is a son of Mr Justice Ramon Leon, head of the 
Independent 
Media Commission. 
  Sources at Sunday's Federal Council meeting -- which was 
called to appoint an acting leader to replace Dr Zach de Beer, 
who retired from public life recently -- said Mr Leon had been 
given a standing ovation after the straight contest with Mr 
Andrew in which he had obtained a clear majority. Mr Andrew had 
gone up to congratulate him immediately after the results had 
been announced, one of the sources said. 
  The DP is to elect its permanent new leader at a federal 
congress, scheduled for Durban in September.

<F P=106> [Article by Amrit Manga] </F>
  [Text] As South African workers wake from the celebrations 
over the democratic victory in last month's elections, COSATU 
[Congress of South African Trade Unions] general secretary Sam 
Shilowa has sounded a note of caution that could dampen some of 
the euphoria. 
  This week, he told the 57th congress of the Canadian Union 
confederation, CSN: "While we are happy, we are also uncertain." 
  Shilowa was referring to the challenges that lie ahead in 
meeting the expectations of workers, many of which have been 
raised by the ANC's electoral victory. 
  "We are gripped with fear, fear of whether our democracy 
will 
succeed, fear of being forgotten by the international community, 
fear of being unable to fulfill our members' expectations," he 
told the union meeting in Montreal. 
  Their expectations, Shilowa said, were for more jobs, 
houses, 
better living conditions, better wages, improved labour 
legislation, electricity and water. 
  Although Shilowa did not say so, these are expectations 
workers have of the ANC-led government of national unity. 
  They make up the core of the Reconstruction and Development 
Programme (RDP) and will cost at least R [Rand] 80-billion on 
the basis of the ANC's latest estimates. 
  While a significant part of these costs will be met by 
revenue generated inside the country, there is little doubt that 
foreign aid will also play a role. 
  Shilowa was direct in his assessment of just how long it 
will 
take for some of the expectations built up around the RDP to be 
met. 
  "All of these can't be achieved overnight. It will take 
time. It needs resources, it needs the support of our members." 
  Shilowa also used the opportunity to justify COSATU's role 
in 
the liberation struggle. "Many people have condemned us for 
being a political union. We do not apologise. If calling for a 
better life for all is political, so be it," he said. 
  "If opposing wasteful government expenditure is political, 
so 
be it," Shilowa added. 
  An underlying warning in the COSATU general secretary's 
message appeared to be that his federation would not become 
complacent under the new conditions but that it would continue 
to speak out against wasteful expenditure and mismanagement in 
government.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H5>  THE STAR </H5>
  Action Urged Against Drug-Trafficking -- In a somber 
editorial the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 24 May on page 
16 writes that "one of the darker consequencies of South 
Africa's return to world respectability is the danger already 
being posed by the import of hard drugs. Huge increases over 
recent years in the confiscated amounts of LSD, heroin and 
cocaine attest to this." The editorial further warns of some of 
the social characteristics in South Africa that may encourage 
those who peddle in the drug trade. "Our fragile new democracy, 
with its vast numbers of unemployed on the streets and an 
entrenched tradition of lawlessness, must look particularly 
fruitful to them." 
<H5>  BUSINESS DAY </H5>
  KwaZulu Land Deal Viewed -- "The transfer of 1.2 million 
hectares of land to a trust controlled by King Goodwill 
Zwelithini does not appear to be, in itself, cause for concern, 
which in some circles is reaching almost hysterical 
proportions," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 
24 May in a page 14 editorial. "The affected rural areas of 
KwaZulu/Natal are among the country's most overpopulated and 
overfarmed and could hardly be redistributed to newcomers." 
"What is disturbing, though, is the way the measure was 
furtively pushed through, and the implications this has for 
peace in KwaZulu/Natal." "The last thing the country needed on 
the eve of the opening of the new Parliament was questions about 
the good faith of De Klerk and Buthelezi, representing the 
non-ANC sectors of the new government." 
<H5>  SUNDAY NATION </H5>
  SDU's Criticized -- "Self-Defence Units [SDU] have played a 
sterling role in the protection of our communities in the past 
three to four years," begins the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in 
English on 22 May in a page 6 editorial. "They succeeded where 
the formal enforcement agencies failed." After commending the 
SDU's, however, the editorial states that "what is amply 
apparent is that the SDUs have, in some cases, decayed into 
bands of criminals masquerading as defenders of our 
communities." To remedy this situation, 2 courses of action 
need to be followed: first, "the element of transperancy" in 
community policing needs to be established; second, "we must 
disarm the SDUs. Neither of this will be easy. There is still 
a great deal of suspicion, and justifiably so." The editorial 
thens floats the possibility of integrating the SDU's into the 
police force: "Incorporating members of the SDUs into a new 
police force must not be rejected out of hand."

  [Text] Since 0600 this morning, the Rwanda Patriotic Front 
[RPF] has begun observing a two-day truce. This is being done 
to enable the UN special envoy, who is in our country, to hold 
discussions with both sides concerning the UN mission to be 
deployed here. It is within the framework of facilitating this 
mission that the RPF has declared a total truce. The RPF is in 
favor of the truce, but the RPF's observance depends on its 
observance by the Rwandan Army.

  [Text] Nairobi, May 23 (AFP) -- Rwanda's Army and rebels 
began a truce Monday [23 May], after a night of fighting, for 
the visit of a special UN envoy who is to prepare the ground for 
the planned arrival of thousands of peacekeeping troops, UN 
officials said. 
  "We haven't heard gunfire all morning," said a UN official 
contacted by telephone in Kigali. 
  Both sides pledged to observe a two-day truce starting 
Monday 
to allow special envoy Iqbal Riza, expected in Kigali later 
Monday, to open discussions with rebels and Rwanda's interim 
government, holed up in Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 miles) 
southwest of the embattled capital, UN spokesman Abdul Kabia 
said. 
  The truce brought calm to Kigali after a night of heavy 
shelling following the capture of Kigali airport and a big army 
base by the rebels Sunday. 
  The capture of Kanombe Barracks, Kigali's most heavily 
fortified army position, was seen by military analysts as the 
biggest achievement by the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) in 
six weeks of fighting since the April 6 death of President 
Juvenal Habyarimana threw Rwanda into turmoil. 
  RPF secretary-general Theogene Rudasingwa, however, said 
there was no truce, but pledged that rebel guerrillas would 
"hold fire as much as possible" to allow Riza to travel safely. 
  Rudasingwa told a news conference in Nairobi that reports by 
UN officials that both sides had agreed to a 48-hour truce were 
"exaggerated." 
  Up to half a million people, mostly members of the minority 
Tutsi tribe that dominates the RPF, and Hutu opposition 
supporters, have been butchered in a six-week-old bloodbath. 
Extremist Hutu militias have been blamed for much of the 
killing. 
  Riza, the personal representative of UN Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, was due to arrive in Kigali by road from 
Uganda later Monday for talks with both sides about plans to 
boost the number of UN soldiers in Rwanda from 400 to 5,500 to 
end massacres of civilians and help displaced people. 
  The Security Council authorised the deployment after the 
United Nations came under heavy criticism for withdrawing most 
of its 2,500 ceasefire monitors as bloodletting engulfed the 
small central African country last month.

  [Text] Nairobi, May 23 (AFP) -- A UN envoy called off a 
trip to Kigali on Monday [23 May] despite a shaky truce in 
Rwanda's embattled capital, saying neither rebels nor government 
forces could guarantee his security. 
  The envoy, Iqbal Riza, was to have travelled to Kigali by 
road Monday to continue discussions to pave the way for the 
return of UN peacekeepers to stem ethnic slaughter in Rwanda. 
But after talks in the morning with leaders of the rebel Rwanda 
Patriotic Front (RPF) at their headquarters in Mulindi, northern 
Rwanda, Riza cancelled the trip and returned to Uganda by 
helicopter, a UN spokesman said. 
  "We did not obtain explicit guarantees from the two parties 
about his safety," spokesman Abdul Kabia said by telephone from 
Kigali, where fighting tailed off despite sporadic gunfire. 
  Kabia said both sides had agreed to a two-day truce to allow 
Riza to hold talks with rebel leaders and Rwanda's interim 
government on plans to deploy 5,500 UN troops to stem a 
six-week-old bloodbath in which up to half-a-million people have 
been killed. 
  The rebels, however, said they had not agreed to a full 
truce, but had agreed to hold fire wherever possible to allow 
Riza to travel safely. 
  But Riza was still concerned about negotiating a dangerous 
crossing just outside Kigali, Kabia said. 
  "The truce is largely holding," Kabia said. "There are 
occasional exchanges of fire, but there's a lot less fighting 
than usual and so we consider that the truce is being respected."

  [Text] Today at Mulindi the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
delegation headed by the RPF president, Colonel Alexis 
Kanyarengwe, met two UN representatives, Iqbal Riza and General 
Bakili. The RPF president talks about the subject of the 
meeting: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] You have just met members of a 
UN delegation. What was the purpose of the meeting? 
  [Kanyarengwe] As you heard recently, the UN Security Council 
recently resolved to send troops to Rwanda to assist the war- 
affected people. Today we were discussing the modalities of the 
coming of the force, on whether we accept its arrival and 
facilitate its mission. 
  [Correspondent] What was the outcome of the discussions? 
  [Kanyarengwe] Concerning how the force will come, we reached 
an understanding, but the countries composing the force will 
have to be agreed upon first. The other thing we agreed on is 
that the force will only deal with humanitarian assistance. It 
will help the relief organizations which are feeding people, and 
will stand guard due to the uncertainty related to the 
Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development militias] who (?are killing) innocent people. The 
force will rescue such endangered people by taking them to safe 
places where it can protect them.

  [Text] The UN envoy has not been able to visit Kigali, 
contrary to expectations. Can we talk of a mission failure? 
Thierry Perret put the question to the Canadian Jean-Guy 
Plante, military spokesman of the UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda]: 
  [Begin recording] [Plante] No, I would not say it was a 
failure, one could rather talk of difficulties. Mr. Riza has in 
fact had [word indistinct] from the representatives of the 
Patriotic Front. He did not meet the commander of the patriotic 
forces, but he met important figures in this movement. So one 
cannot really talk of a failure. Mr. Riza is expected to met 
the representatives of the Rwandan Government and the chief of 
staff of the Rwandan Army tomorrow. 
  [Perret] So it seems that the UN envoy intended to visit 
Kigali but could not do so, why? 
  [Plante] He could not visit for security reasons. The route 
he was expected to take is under the control of the Patriotic 
Front. The latter preferred to warn us that this route was not 
secure. He will board a plane of the Canadian Armed Forces for 
Kigali tomorrow. This plane, which comes regularly to Kigali, 
landed in the capital today for the first time in five days.

  [Excerpts] A temporary truce lasting two days which had 
been accepted between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and the 
Rwandan Government forces to facilitate the visit of a UN envoy, 
Iqbal Riza, who is visiting Rwanda, has been violated by the 
Rwandan Government forces. The envoy is visiting Rwanda to 
discuss with the RPF and the government forces the deployment of 
the UN forces to Rwanda. [passage omitted]. 
  The UN Envoy Iqbal Riza has said that the number of 5,500 
forces will go up or lower depending on the negotiations with 
the two warring sides. The envoy today held talks with the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front leadership at Mulindi, northern Rwanda. 
He is planning to meet the leadership of the Rwandan Government 
forces tomorrow. The government forces have violated the truce 
and the UN envoy could not go to Kigali. From Mulindi he 
returned to Kampala.

  [Text] Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] Secretary General 
Theogene Rudasingwa today in Nairobi pledged that his guerrillas 
would hold fire as much as possible to allow the current 
temporary truce in the Rwandan civil war to hold until tomorrow 
when it expires. He pledged that his forces will fight on until 
those responsible for the massacres of an estimated half a 
million Rwandans are brought to justice. 
  Rudasingwa confirmed that his movement had captured Kigali 
airport and an army barracks in the latest fighting. 
  He said his movement was still committed to the goal of the 
Arusha peace process. This includes a power-sharing 
administration, the formation of the national army, the rule of 
law, and the return of about 2 million Rwandans displaced from 
their homes by civil war. 
  Rudasingwa reiterated his reservations over a proposal to 
send 5,500 additional UN peacekeepers to boost the 400-strong UN 
force already in Rwanda. He said the United Nations' role in 
Rwanda should only be humanitarian. 
  The truce was agreed by the warring sides to allow a UN 
special envoy to discuss the deployment of UN troops. Our 
latest reports say the envoy has called off the discussions 
after failing to get the guarantee of his safety from the 
warring sides.

  [Excerpts] Our colleague [name indistinct] has just arrived 
from Kanombe airport in Kigali and brings us news from the area. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Here is the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] 
commander in chief, Paul Kagame. The RPA have captured the 
Kanombe barracks and the Kanombe airport. What have you 
accomplished? 
  [Kagame] We have succeeded in capturing two places as part 
of 
our efforts to capture Kigali and restore peace to Kigali. This 
will be the beginning of the restoration of peace throughout the 
country. This is important because the airport has many uses. 
We also found a lot of military equipment, which will help us 
in our work in case talks do not succeed. 
  [Correspondent] Looking at your targets, are you happy with 
your achievements? 
  [Kagame] We are happy with our achievements. Many people 
have been killed unjustly. Many have died but we have been able 
to save many others who might not be alive had we not done the 
work. We can continue to carry out the job. I think that our 
victories will allow us to bring the killers to justice. What 
is necessary is for our force to bring these people to justice.

  [Text] After taking control of Rwanda's international 
airport and Kanombe military barracks, the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] has pledged to cooperate with the United Nations in 
order to facilitate humanitarian activities of the United 
Nations. The airport in Kigali has been a contested area and 
the UN activities have been disrupted a number of times. The 
United Nations has had to cancel a number of flights to Rwanda 
due to the heavy fighting at the airport. The United Nations 
has been trying to negotiate for neutrality of the airport with 
the RPF and the Rwandan Government forces. Now that the airport 
is no longer contested the question of negotiating neutrality at 
the airport may no longer be relevant. What is needed now is for 
the United Nations to work out modalities with the RPF 
concerning the use of the airport by the United Nations.

  [Text] Nairobi, 24 May (AFP) -- Thousands of terrified 
Rwandans are scrambling out of Kigali before the expected rebel 
takeover of the capital which they fear will usher in reprisals 
for the massacres of Tutsis, relief officials said Tuesday [24 
May]. 
  A special United Nations envoy was meanwhile expected to fly 
into Kigali from the Ugandan capital Kampala on Tuesday after a 
dispute with the mainly Tutsi rebels about the planned 
deployment of 5,500 peacekeepers to staunch ethnic bloodletting 
in which up to half a million people have been butchered. The 
envoy, Iqbal Riza, postponed his trip to Kigali on Monday 
because he said neither rebels nor government forces could 
guarantee his security. The Army has since promised not to 
shoot down Riza's plane, and rebels who captured Kigali Airport 
Sunday have also pledged to hold their fire, UN spokesman Abdul 
Kabia said. 
  The UN has asked the Army and rebels to extend a shaky 
two-day truce that began Monday when Riza arrived in northern 
Rwanda until Wednesday at six p.m. (1600 GMT). Both sides were 
to respond later Tuesday, Kabia said. 
  Riza held "inconclusive" discussions about the return of UN 
troops to Rwanda with leaders of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic 
Front (RPF) in their northern stronghold of Mulindi on Monday, 
Kabia said. "There was a disagreement over the size of the 
force," he said. The rebels want a maximum of 2,500 UN troops 
because they fear that 5,500 soldiers could intervene in 
fighting between the RPF and the Army though intervention is not 
part of its essentially humanitarian mandate, Kabia said. 
  Relief officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
thousands of people were streaming out of Kigali in a desperate 
scramble for safety before the rebels seize control of the 
capital. UN military officials expect the rebels to take over 
"within a week."

<F P=106> ["Message" from Paul Kagame, chairman of the Rwandan </F>
Patriotic Army High Command, to the Rwandan Government forces; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] Army's High 
Command has again found it necessary to inform the officers and 
men of the Rwandan Government forces of the following: 
  1. The [word indistinct] clique in collaboration with some 
members of the military leadership have continued to deceive and 
misguide the Army into fighting a suicidal war and committing 
atrocities against innocent civilians. The clique has time and 
again carried out propaganda that the Army should fight to the 
last man. The clique is using the Army to protect themselves 
from the consequences of the atrocities they have committed. 
This propaganda has been carried out notably by some privileged 
officers and men as a result of discrimination. These are 
responsible for atrocities. They have, for example, continued to 
tell lies that the government Army is winning the war when you 
know the reality because you are the ones who are fighting. 
Soldiers should not be fooled. They should use their 
intelligence to see that they have had many defeats and should 
not allow themselves to be finished for the sake of the clique. 
  2. The Rwandan Patriotic Army is aware that there are some 
good elements in the government forces who have continued to be 
misled and misused. It is for this reason that we call upon all 
the good elements to reject being used and fighting desperate 
wars. 
  3. The Rwandan Patriotic Army calls upon the good elements 
within the government forces to dissociate themselves from the 
clique and find ways of joining the Rwandan Patriotic Army. 
  4. The Rwandan Patriotic Army receives anybody who chooses 
to defect or desert the group of criminals. The propaganda by 
the clique that we kill those who cross to our side or that we 
kill prisoners of war is absolutely false and is aimed at 
discouraging you from isolating the criminals. 
  We already have members of the government Army who have 
defected to our side and prisoners who have later chosen to join 
hands with us. The interviews of these people will pass over 
Radio Muhabura. Those of you who may not be convinced by this 
assurance can send a few people to the areas we control. 
  5. Political party youthwingers who have been compelled to 
join hands with the notorious Interahamwe [militias] for fear of 
losing their lives should denounce this association and find 
ways of going to safe areas. 
  Finally, all those who may wish to cross over to our side 
are 
assured that they will be safe.

  [Excerpt] Residents of Bugesera, southern Rwanda, who had 
fled to Burundi, are now returning home. Only yesterday, 500 
people crossed the border from Burundi to Rwanda. The returnees 
have complained that the Red Cross officials in Burundi are 
preventing the people from returning home. It has been reported 
that the Red Cross has even tried to shift the refugee camps and 
take them further into the interior of Burundi so as to make it 
more difficult for the refugees to return home. The Red Cross 
in Burundi is not succeeding because the refugees are returning 
home in large numbers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kinshasa, 23 May (AFP) -- Zairian television 
reported yesterday evening that the homes of two members of the 
High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament were 
attacked with grenades on 22 May. The television report blamed 
these attacks "on Etienne Tshisekedi's extremist supporters." 
Tshisekedi was prime minister until dismissed from office by 
President Mobutu in February 1993, however, he remains a 
candidate for the post. The report's accusation was criticized 
in this morning's issue of the opposition daily REFERENCE-PLUS, 
which condemns "this gruesome storyteller's rubbish, which is 
not based on any inquiry." The two personalities targeted by 
the attacks belong to Rally of Forces of Democratic Change 
[RFCD], a member of the radical opposition's "Allies" coalition, 
which did not back Mr. Tshisekedi's candidacy for the 
premiership. The RFCD endorsed the candidacy of Mulumba Lukoji, 
who held the post in 1991.

  [Excerpt] Members of the diplomatic mission resident in 
Uganda visited Kasensero landing site in Rakai District, 
following reports of large numbers of bodies landing there after 
being carried to Lake Victoria from the River Kagera. The tour 
was organized by urban task force to show the diplomats the 
seriousness of the matter. The diplomats, who were led by the 
country director of the USAID, Mr. Keith Sharper, were 
accompanied by the minister of state for internal affairs, Mr. 
Tom Butime, and the chairman of the pan- African congress, 
Colonel Kahinda Otafiire. 
  During the tour, the chairman of the urban task force, Mr. 
(Mike Mukula), revealed that, according to an aerial survey 
conducted last week, an estimated 40,000 floating bodies are on 
Uganda's part of Lake Victoria. He said this is a big threat to 
the people who live along the shores, as they directly use lake 
water. 
  At Kasensero landing site, by yesterday, an average of 80 
bodies were being reclaimed per hour. Mr. (Mukula) said already 
600 hundred bodies had been observed approaching Mpigi, and if 
the situation is not contained, the beaches in Gaba and Entebbe 
may soon be affected. 
  After the tour of the landing site, the diplomats attended a 
burial mass for the reclaimed bodies at Kitoma Village, seven km 
from the landing site. The mass, conducted by Archbishop 
Emmanuel Wamalwa of Kampala, attracted hundreds of wananchi 
[citizens] in the area, and Rwandese refugees in Uganda. The 
archbishop prayed for the return of sanity in Rwanda, and urged 
Ugandan Christians to pray for the war-torn country. 
  The resident director of USAID, Mr. Sharper, termed events 
in 
Rwanda as a step backwards in the development of human race. He 
said such a problem knows no boundaries, and thanked Uganda for 
tackling the problem of floating bodies without hesitation. 
  Speaking on behalf of African diplomats, Ambassador 
(Leonidas 
Habyarimana) of Burundi urged African countries to cultivate 
mature politics, in order to avoid acts similar to the Rwandan 
crisis. He regretted that, while Africa has a big potential 
wealth, bad politics is tearing the continent. He called for an 
immediate end to the situation. 
  The British high commissioner, Mr. Edward Clay, termed the 
situation in Rwanda as a shame to modern society. He said it 
was sad that events that characterized Rwanda 30 years ago are 
happening again at a time when peace is crucial. 
  The NRC [National Resistance Council] member for (Kakoto), 
Rakai District, Mr. (Manuel Pinto), challenged Kenya and 
Tanzania to join Uganda in the efforts of cleaning Lake 
Victoria. He urged Ugandans to unite and love one another, as 
hatred is the source of problems similar to what is happening in 
Rwanda. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cape Town -- President Nelson Mandela had not 
opposed demands by the Inkatha Freedom Party and KwaZulu 
government before the elections that King Goodwill Zwelithini be 
given royal control of KwaZulu tribal land, a top adviser to the 
king said yesterday. Inkatha central committee member and newly 
appointed KwaZulu/Natal education minister Vincent Zulu said the 
issue was discussed at length at the April 8 summit at Skukuza, 
attended by then president F.W. de Klerk, Inkatha leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Zwelithini and Mandela and their 
negotiators. 
  "Mandela said our demand was valid and he undertook to 
discuss it with his national executive," Zulu said. "He said he 
would do everything possible to satisfy the king's demand." 
  Mandela and Buthelezi were scheduled to meet in Cape Town 
last night to discuss the growing row. 
  De Klerk authorised the transfer of 1.2 million hectares of 
land to a trust controlled by Zwelithini on April 25. 
  ANC acting presidential spokesman Carl Niehaus said 
yesterday 
Mandela had "nothing more" to add until he had met Buthelezi. 
  Mandela said on Friday he became aware of the land deal only 
on Friday after media reports. He said the ANC had not been 
involved in talks on the deal. 
  De Klerk, speaking in London on Friday, said it was 
"nonsense" to suggest there had been a secret deal. 
  Zulu said the KwaZulu government, by legislating for the 
royal control of tribal land, had "just wanted to make sure" 
about the future. If government at central or provincial level 
wanted to develop tribal land in KwaZulu in future, for whatever 
purpose, it would have to negotiate with the king, he said.

  [Text] The prime minister and first vice president, the 
Honorable John Malecela, has said the only way of finding a 
solution to the current crisis in Rwanda lay in holding a 
meeting of the heads of state of neighboring countries to 
discuss it. Malecela said a meeting of the leaders of Tanzania, 
Kenya, Uganda, Zaire, and representatives of parties involved in 
the crisis could reach a solution that would end the conflict. 
The prime minister said this during talks in his office in Dar 
es Salaam with the Belgian ambassador to Rwanda, Mr. Johan 
Swinning, who is paying a special visit to countries neighboring 
Rwanda. 
  Malecela and his guest stressed that plans to bring about a 
cease-fire and an end to animosity on both sides and the 
killings were vital issues in ushering in a permanent peace in 
Rwanda.

  [Excerpts] Addis Ababa, 24 May (KNA/PANA) -- The 
Organization of African Unity (OAU) had called for the trial of 
those responsible for the massacres and wanton killings in 
Rwanda. 
  In a message to the United Nations Human Rights Commission, 
which was to begin a special session on Rwanda in Geneva today, 
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim said this would serve as 
a warning to other perpetrators of similar crimes. 
  "Africa and, indeed, the world in general would like to know 
the perpetrators of this heinous crime and the magnitude of 
these brutal murder and massacres which no doubt, constitute a 
crime against humanity," Salim said. 
  The Geneva session was to consider the calculated decimation 
of ethnic groups in Rwanda and consider appointing a human 
rights rapporteur for the country. It was also to consider 
stationing of human rights monitors there. [passage omitted] 
  Salim urged the commission to adopt measures to ensure that 
such crimes were not allowed to recur "not only in Rwanda but 
throughout the African continent, and elsewhere in the world". 
"Let the commission serve notice to all present and future 
perpetrators of such despicable crimes that the world will not 
allow them to get away with it and that they shall be sought 
after and be prosecuted to the full extent of the law," he said. 
  Salim welcomed the convening of the special session of the 
commission, saying it was the first time in the history of the 
U.N. that a special session exclusively devoted to matters of 
human rights violations in Africa was being convened and "on a 
country whose chequered history has been marred with bloodshed, 
senseless killings and violence". He said he hoped its session 
would "be a message of hope to the surviving victims (in Rwanda) 
that the world cares...and stands in solidarity with them in 
seeking justice on their behalf".

  [Text] Nairobi, May 23 (AFP)--The self-proclaimed Republic 
of Somaliland, which broke away from Somalia three years ago, on 
Monday recognised the newly-proclaimed Yemen Democratic Republic 
in the south of the country. 
  A statement faxed to AFP here from President Mohamed Ibrahim 
Egal in the Somaliland capital, Hargeisa, said Somaliland would 
recognize the constitutionality and legitimacy of the new 
sovereign republic in South Yemen and would place at its 
disposal all its support. 
  Somaliland declared independence after the overthrow of 
Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre, but has not been recognised 
internationally. 
  "Being well-placed by our own bitter experience to 
understand 
and appreciate fully the dilemma which has faced the people and 
government of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, we, the people 
and government of the Republic of Somaliland, hasten to 
recognize the constitutionality and the legitimacy of the 
sovereign republic", the statement said. 
  "Being un-recognized ourselves, we know that in 
international 
terms our recognition carries no de-jure benefit for the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, but we place at the disposal of 
its government all our support", the statement pointed out. 
  South Yemen declared its independence from the north on 
Friday and on Sunday appointed former Yemeni Vice-President 'Ali 
Salim al- Bid as its new president, with the port city of Aden 
as its capital. 
  But Yemen's President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northern, has 
condemned Baid, his sacked deputy, as "a traitor" and a 
statement from Sanaa hinted on Saturday that the north would cut 
off ties with any country recognizing the new republic. 
  The appointment of al-Bid came on the day Yemenis might have 
been celebrating the fourth anniversary of union between the 
conservative, Muslim north and the south.

Dualde, two visiting officials from the UN Human Rights 
Commission. They were received by President Obiang Nguema 
Mbasogo at the People's Palace in Malabo yesterday in the 
presence of Francisco Javier Ngomo Mgbengono, the minister of 
justice and religion. The two officials briefed the head of 
state on the outcome of their 15-day human rights investigation 
in Equatorial Guinea. Speaking to newsmen, they expressed 
satisfaction with the human rights situation in the country. 
However, they pointed out that there were still some aspects 
which needed to be improved; however, they did not mention these 
aspects to the media. Sources close to the commission have 
indicated that the mission will end its visit this week.

  [Text] Nairobi, 24 May (AFP) -- A UN envoy arrived in 
Kigali on Tuesday [24 May] and held talks with Rwandan Army 
commanders to pave the way for a new UN peacekeeping mission in 
blood-drenched Rwanda despite rebel objections, a spokesman said. 
  The envoy, Iqbal Riza, met rebel leaders in their northern 
stronghold of Mulindi on Monday but was unable to reach 
agreement with them on the size of a planned UN force, spokesman 
Abdul Kabia said. The rebels object to the UN's plan to send 
5,500 peacekeepers to Rwanda and maintain that 2,500 soldiers 
will be enough to escort relief convoys. 
  The blue helmets have not been mandated to intervene in 
fighting between the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front and government 
forces. But they are supposed to stem the wholesale slaughter 
of civilians by bloodthirsty militiamen. Up to half a million 
Rwandans have been butchered in six weeks of ethnic carnage. 
  Diplomats and military analysts, however, said it was 
unclear 
how they could do so, whether they numbered 5,500 or 2,500. The 
rebels objected to Riza's plan to hold talks with the 
self-proclaimed interim government on Wednesday, saying such a 
meeting would be tantamount to recognising the government's 
legitimacy. But Kabia said the planned meeting "does not 
constitute recognition of the government." "The special envoy 
will see the government as the de facto authority because he was 
mandated to talk to all parties," Kabia told AFP by telephone 
from Kigali. 
  Rebels and government soldiers held fire as Riza's plane 
arrived from the Ugandan capital Kampala late Tuesday morning. 
Riza cancelled his plan to drive to Kigali from rebel 
headquarters in Mulindi, near the Ugandan border, on Monday, 
saying neither side could guarantee his security.

  [Text] Nairobi, May 25 (AFP) -- The United Nations 
cancelled its two daily flights to Kigali on Wednesday [25 May] 
after the Canadian Hercules C-130 used in the operation was hit 
by a bullet in the Rwandan capital on Tuesday, a UN military 
spokesman said. The spokesman said the bullet, which had been 
fired by a light weapon, had left a hole in one of the plane's 
wings. 
  The incident was not discovered until the plane was 
inspected 
on its arrival back in Nairobi. The spokesman said the bullet 
must have been fired either when the plane was landing at Kigali 
or taking off. It was not known when the UN Assistance Mission 
to Rwanda would resume its relief flights to Rwanda. The 
spokesman said the military would be consulting engineers to 
decide what needed to be done to make the Hercules safe. 
  With a shaky truce more or less holding, a UN special envoy 
flew into Kigali Tuesday to discuss the deployment of 5,500 
troops the United Nations hopes to muster, in a bid to protect 
civilians and safeguard relief convoys. 
  Meanwhile relief workers reported Tuesday that thousands of 
Rwandans were fleeing Kigali before the expected rebel takeover 
of the capital, which they fear will usher in reprisals for the 
massacres of Tutsis. Up to half a million people have been 
butchered in ethnic bloodletting since April.

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, May 25 (AFP) -- Two Rwandan Red Cross 
workers were killed and several other people wounded when a 
shell slammed into a field hospital in Kigali on Wednesday [25 
May], an official of the International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC) said. 
  The United Nations meanwhile cancelled its two daily relief 
flights to Kigali on Wednesday after a UN plane was hit by a 
bullet in the Rwandan capital on Tuesday. 
  The ICRC opened the hospital last month to ease the strain 
on 
Kigali's overcrowded main hospital, where 30 patients were 
killed when it was shelled last week. 
  Further details of Wednesday's shelling were not immediately 
available, the ICRC official said in Nairobi. It was unknown 
who had fired the shell. The ICRC is one of the few aid 
agencies still operating in Kigali, where rebels are locked in 
combat with the army. [passage omitted] 
  Sporadic shelling shook Rwanda's blood-sodden capital 
Wednesday despite a partial truce between the two sides during 
the visit of a special United Nations envoy, UN military sources 
said. Up to half a million people have been hacked, clubbed, 
burned or shot to death in six weeks of frenzied ethnic 
slaughter in Rwanda, much of it blamed on beer-swilling 
militiamen only loosely controlled by the government. Most of 
the victims were minority Tutsis and Hutus suspected of 
supporting the mainly Tutsi rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front. 
Another 500,000 Rwandans, Hutus and Tutsis, have sought refuge 
in neighbouring countries.

<F P=106> [Marie-France Cros report: "Jean Birara: `The Belgians and </F>
French Could Have Stopped the Killing'"] 
  [Text] His smile is infrequent but dazzling and reassuring 
like a sudden burst of sun in a stormy sky. His constant frown 
gives his face a severity which is only softened by the sad 
kindness of his gaze and gray hair. Jean Birara, now former 
governor of the National Bank of Rwanda and a man who is 
respected in his country, is not inclined to optimism. Those 
who have been listening to him for four years know that, 
unfortunately, he was right. 
  Although a member of no political party, he was consulted by 
all. He is a northerner and has family ties with people in 
power, especially in the Army, and he also has the respect of 
the southern opposition because he was one of the oldest 
opponents of the Habyarimana regime. 
<H5>  The Presidential Guard Against the Army </H5>
  It is this man who thinks that "Belgium and France could 
have 
halted the massacres in the first few hours if they had so 
wished. Do not forget that the Presidential Guard was trained by 
the Belgians." It is this Guard which, together with the 
Interahamwe militia of President Habyarimana's former single 
party, is responsible for most of the massacres. In Jean 
Birara's view, the two bodies are virtually the same. "The 
Interahamwes are the Presidential Guard leading the young. It 
forms the basis of this militia of around 50,000 members, mainly 
reservists." 
  According to him, "after the assassination of the president, 
the Guard fought for two days against the rest of the Army which 
wanted to maintain the Arusha agreements. They were reconciled 
on Friday evening when they knew that the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic 
Front] was attacking." 
  Mr. Birara fears the continuation of the massacres. "This 
can 
go on as long as there are young people with weapons throughout 
the country. In a commune in Gisenyi, which has 140,000 
inhabitants, the mayor told me there were 50,000 guns." 
<H5>  Europe Knew </H5>
  Mr. Birara thinks the Europeans should intervene. He does 
not believe in an African intervention: There is no 
satisfactory precedent in this sphere. Mr. Birara said that the 
European chancelleries knew that the massacres were being 
planned. He warned the Belgian political world "at a very high 
level" where people preferred to believe that "Habyarimana was a 
saintly man" and do nothing. "In 1991, when I was in danger, an 
application to renew my visa was turned down and I was forced to 
leave." 
  According to Mr. Birara, Belgian diplomacy in Rwanda changed 
when, following action by the nuncio -- who, he said was the 
only ambassador along with Belgian Johan Swinnen who had sounded 
the alarm about what was being planned -- the Rwandan church 
stopped supporting the regime. 
<H5>  The Massacre Was Planned </H5>
  What was being planned? The massacre. "The list of people 
to be eliminated numbered 60 names at the end of 1992, 500 in 
April 1993. At noon on 20 February 1994, Army Chief of Staff 
General Nsabimana, my relative, showed me a list of 1,500 names 
just for Kigali. He did not support that plan, drawn up with 
President Habyarimana's consent. He told me he had succeeded 
three times in preventing it but that, on the fourth, he could 
no longer do so and urged me to leave. On 4 April, another 
officer told me that serious things were being planned and that 
he did not know whether he would still be alive in a week's time. 
  On 6 April, the attack took place and General Nsabimana was 
in the plane with the head of state. The latter's removal had 
been decided by his own officers in October 1992. But secrets 
are difficult to keep because everybody has relatives in all the 
groups."

<F P=106> [Interview with Jacques Bihozagara, Rwandan Patriotic Front </F>
member and vice prime minister designate in the transitional 
government, by Henri Vernet in Geneva; date not given: "Jacques 
Bihozagara: `International Court Needed'" -- first paragraph is 
LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS introduction] 
  [Text] A member of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), 
Jacques Bihozagara is the "vice prime minister designate" in the 
transitional government which was expanded to integrate members 
of the Tutsi minority and which is to take power in Kigali, 
according to the Arusha agreement signed in August last year. 
Mr. Bihozagara, who was in Rwanda's capital when the fighting 
was at its fiercest, is currently a refugee in Geneva. 
  While overtly skeptical with regard to the UN "long overdue" 
planned intervention, he wants an international court to be 
convened "to try the initiators of the genocide in Rwanda." 
  [Vernet] The UN decision to send more Blue Helmets to Kigali 
met with little enthusiasm on the part of the RPF. Why is that? 
  [Bihozagara] We simply consider that this decision was long 
overdue as the massacres and genocide have been consummated by 
now. Action was needed last month, when the Blue Helmets were 
still in Rwanda. All it would have taken then to avert the 
slaughter was to broaden their mandate. The UN special envoy in 
Rwanda, who displayed partiality and, above all, who proved 
unable to evaluate the situation, bears a heavy responsibility 
for what happened. 
  [Vernet] But those Blue Helmets will still serve a purpose. 
For example, Bernard Kouchner [former French humanitarian 
minister] suggests that "humanitarian corridors" should be 
created... 
  [Bihozagara] True, in Kigali and elsewhere in Rwanda, there 
are "pockets" of refugees gathered in hotels, hospitals, 
churches, etc. They must be rescued. But to achieve such a 
humanitarian mission, UN troops still in the country (400 men), 
possibly with limited reinforcements, would be enough. There is 
no need whatsoever to send in 5,500 soldiers, as decided by the 
Security Council, where, if I may remind you, Rwanda's 
representative is a man friendly with the "self-proclaimed 
government," that bunch of murderers we do not recognize as 
representing anyone but themselves. 
  [Vernet] As a permanent member of the Security Council, 
France wanted an even stronger UN mandate. What are your 
suspicions with respect to the United Nations? 
  [Bihozagara] I have no "suspicions" and I repeat I favor a 
strictly humanitarian mission. Still, the planned intervention 
will give the government Army time to regroup, which is a shame 
since it was being routed by the RPF yesterday. And this will 
strengthen the self-proclaimed government. In other words, the 
United Nations is helping the very people responsible for the 
April massacres! 
  [Vernet] Speaking of which, there have been large 
discrepancies in the -- horrifying -- body counts. There is 
talk of "100,000 to 200,000 dead," and some people, such as 
Germany's Klaus Kinkel, mention 500,000 casualties... 
  [Bihozagara] What is beyond doubt is that such figures will 
be a serious thorn in the side of those who wrote history books 
in Rwanda in the last three decades. Officials always claimed 
that out of a population of seven millions, only 10 percent were 
Tutsis. But since there are Tutsis that are still alive after 
this genocide, it means that we must have been lied to for 
years. Because not only is a 500,000 figure likely, but it will 
presumably increase... 
  [Vernet] Militarily, the RPF has now gained the upper hand. 
What is your goal? 
  [Bihozagara] We want to oust, capture, and bring before the 
courts the members of this bogus government. They are the 
initiators of this genocide, which was carried out according to 
a carefully devised plan as early as the night that followed 
President Habyarimana's assassination on 6 April. We wrote the 
UN Security Council asking that it convene an international 
court should we fail to stop these people ourselves. A court 
like the one set up in Europe after the fall of Nazi Germany, or 
the one decided for the former Yugoslavia. They are Nazis. 
African Nazis, but Nazis just the same, like Hitler. 
  [Vernet] You have been steadily charging France with 
"complicity" with the late president's regime. To what extent? 
  [Bihozagara] Is it a coincidence that, as I told you, so 
many dignitaries of that dictatorship sought refuge in your 
country? This long-lived complicity has been proved time and 
time again. Several months after Arusha, which was concluded in 
August 1993, Habyarimana would still not enforce the peace 
agreement and establish a transitional government including RPF 
members. At that time, that complicity was still going strong. 
  Need I remind you that Paris remained silent when, from 1992 
onward, after conducting investigations in the country, the 
International Human Rights Federation (IHRF) and other NGO's 
[nongovernmental organizations] condemned the regime's many 
crimes? Among other things, we can prove that the slaughter of 
the Bagogwe, a tribe of shepherds that belong to a Tutsi 
subgroup, took place under the nose of French soldiers. They 
were the very ones who trained the militia leaders who 
perpetrated the killing! 
  [Vernet] Since you believe France is party to the crime, 
does it mean it currently cannot play any part? Not even to 
contribute to a ceasefire? 
  [Bihozagara] We need to agree on which ceasefire we are 
talking about. There are two wars in Rwanda. One between the 
self-styled government and the population. And another one 
between the "government" and the RPF. A ceasefire is urgently 
needed for the former. Here, Paris can indeed act as an 
mediator, it can exert its influence on its friends, the 
militias of extremist parties and the Presidential Guard. 
  [Vernet] But after such horrors, can a reconciliation 
between Hutus and Tutsis be possible? 
  [Bihozagara] This is not a conflict between the Hutus and 
the Tutsis. Many Hutus from the civilian community and 
democratic political circles have been massacred by the regime's 
extremists: 90 percent of the country's politicians, including 
Prime Minister Agathe Uwinlingiyimana, have been exterminated. 
Survivors, i.e., the ones we saved in Kigali, sought refuge in 
areas under our control north of the capital. The same goes for 
the whole population. All in all, we have some 250,000 Hutu and 
Tutsi refugees now living together and everything is working out 
fine. Once the extremists have been controlled, we, the 
politicians, shall have to direct a coherent message at the 
people to show that the so- called ethnic rivalries are 
senseless. 
  [Vernet] The UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) has 
charged the RPF with crimes of its own. What is your answer? 
  [Bihozagara] The UNHCR bases his allegations on testimonies 
collected in refugee camps outside Rwanda. People in these 
camps include a number of yesterday's killers, including the 
mayors who organized and led militias, who handed out machetes 
and grenades. How can one place any faith in such testimonies? 
I have just sent a letter of protest to the UNHCR.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 23 May (AFP) -- Banza Makalay, deputy 
chairman of the Popular Movement of the Revolution [MPR], the 
former single ruling party of which Marshal Mobutu is still the 
chairman, has accused the Zairian opposition of prolonging the 
political crisis in Zaire. "The MPR, he said, has nothing to do 
with the long delay in choosing a transitional prime minister 
and the opposition has itself to blame for not being able to 
control the ambitions of its members." The future prime 
minister of Zaire must be presented by the opposition which has 
not succeeded in agreeing on one candidate. 
  Banza Mukalay was addressing in Lingala -- one of the 
national languages -- several thousand activists who gathered in 
Kinshasa on 22 May to mark the 27th anniversary of the 
foundation of the MPR . 
  The radical opposition LE POTENTIEL newspaper, which 
reported 
this meeting in today's issue, estimated participants at 50,000 
and said it was a "big resurrection of the MPR" which has not 
held any rally since 1991.

<F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>
  [Text] The Angolan peace talks have not yet resumed. The 
leadership of the negotiating team from the National Union for 
the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] is still in Huambo. 
Eugenio Manuvakola, Jorge Valentim, and Elias Samakuva are 
expected to return to Lusaka only tomorrow afternoon. We 
learned from a reliable source that the UN plane will leave for 
Huambo tomorrow morning to bring back the leadership of the 
UNITA negotiating team. 
  Today, the leadership of the government negotiating team 
held 
an informal meeting with Alioune Blondin Beye, special 
representative of the UN secretary general in Angola. 
  If the leadership of the UNITA negotiating team returns to 
Lusaka tomorrow, the talks will only begin after tomorrow, 
because tomorrow is Africa Day and it is a national holiday here 
in Zambia.

  [Text] The valiant, patriotic, and revolutionary Armed 
Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FALA, continue to defend 
Ndalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte, against the aggression 
of Eduardo dos Santos' troops. Our correspondent Firmino 
Lukamba reports from the area: 
  Violent clashes took place on 22 May, when FALA troops 
attacked a convoy of government troops that tried to supply its 
forces besieged around Ndalatando. After one hour and 38 
minutes of heavy clashes along the road between 
Camassai-Quichucula, the enemy was forced to retreat, leaving 
behind three cars [word indistinct], a 10,000 liter fuel tank, 
15 confirmed dead soldiers, 18 AKM-47 weapons, and an 
unspecified number of [words indistinct] military equipment. We 
were unable to present the list of all the captured war materiel 
[words indistinct] our logistical department is involved in the 
process.

to defend local residents from the aggression of Eduardo dos 
Santos' communist troops in the area. On 23 May clashes took 
place in Bela Caiombo, 5 km east of Ebo District, in which the 
People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] 
aggressors fled in disarray, leaving at least 25 of their 
soldiers dead. Meanwhile, in the Chongoa area, an arms depot 
belonging to FAPLA was totally destroyed. Our correspondent 
Capalandanda reports that more materiel was abandoned by FAPLA 
and captured by the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, 
including a 60-mm mortar with more than 80 shells, an 82-mm 
mortar with 14 shells, 23 AKM rifles, one RPK and two PKM 
submachine guns, two RPG-7 launchers with 16 grenades, and 25 
antipersonnel mines. Capalandanda says that the fleeing 
communist forces are being pursued and are leaving behind many 
dead soldiers and much war equipment.

  [Text] In Cabo Delgado today President of the Republic 
Joaquim Chissano inaugurated the graphite plant in Ancuabe 
District, 100 km from the provincial capital, Pemba. Our 
reporter Remigio Membe reports from the area: 
  There are now two factories for processing mining products. 
The marble factory was inaugurated in 1993 by the head of 
state. The graphite plant belongs to a South African 
businessman, and the study for locating the minerals was carried 
out by a Bulgarian company which specializes in mining 
exploration. 
  The president of the Republic, who began his visit to Cabo 
Delgado yesterday, addressed a mass rally in the Chiure District 
capital after concluding his visit to Nampula Province. In 
Chiure Chissano said he is visiting the countryside to acquaint 
himself with the people's problems and to reassure them that the 
war is over in Mozambique. 
  He urged the population to end hatred and concentrate on 
national reconstruction. Answering a question from the head of 
state, the Chiure residents said that the economy and social 
infrastructures were destroyed by the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], adding that all citizens and the government 
need to be involved in national reconstruction. 
  President Chissano also appealed to the Chiure residents to 
prepare to vote in October for the candidate which they believe 
promises a better future for Mozambique. He said the elections 
must be fair and democratic. 
  Before leaving Chiure District, Chissano visited the local 
health center, noting the shortages of beds, mattresses, an 
ambulance, as well as technical and medical personnel. 
  Besides inaugurating the graphite plant, the president of 
the 
Republic might currently be addressing a mass rally in the same 
area. At about 1630 today the Mozambican head of state is 
scheduled to be in Pemba, after an hour and a half journey from 
Ancuabe.

  [Text] President Joaquim Chissano, who is visiting Cabo 
Delgado Province, may be addressing a mass rally in the capital 
of Palma District, 400 km from the city of Pemba. Yesterday the 
head of state attended a banquet with a group of women, members 
of the Mozambique Liberation Front in Pemba. In a message, the 
group says that the Mozambique National Resistance and other 
unarmed opposition parties have already recognized defeat in the 
forthcoming October elections by calling for a government of 
national unity without defining valid criteria. 
  On the occasion, Joaquim Chissano said the women should 
educate the citizens to vote for the party and candidate 
offering them prestige and representation. The head of state is 
scheduled to return to Pemba tomorrow afternoon after addressing 
a rally in the capital of Nangade District.

  [Text] President Joaquim Chissano said today that public 
opinion in the provinces of Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Sofala, Tete, 
Manica, and Gaza encourages him to say that the forthcoming 
multiparty elections will be won by the Mozambique Liberation 
Front [Frelimo] Party and its presidential candidate. The 
Mozambican head of state was addressing about 15,000 people at a 
mass rally in Pemba to mark the end of his working visit to Cabo 
Delgado Province. Chissano requested Cabo Delgado residents to 
vote with confidence and responsibility. 
  President Chissano also said that demobilized and 
war-disabled troops, as well as Mozambicans who returned from 
the former GDR and other countries, should demonstrate their 
initiative so that the Mozambican state and the international 
community can grant them assistance. The head of state said 
this in reply to the demands by these people's associations that 
the government should give them jobs and funds for their 
wellbeing. 
  President Chissano returns to Maputo today.

<F P=106> [Report by Helder Maquequene: "At Last Territorial </F>
Integration Has Begun!"] 
  [Excerpt] Chimoio -- Machote is the first area under the 
control of the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] to be 
integrated into the territorial administration, the only one in 
Manica Province, as part of the administrative reunification of 
the Mozambican territory. This took place last week when one of 
the three Renamo advisers to the Manica provincial government 
"delivered" the area to Sussundenga Administrator Antonio 
Moulinho. Next week it will happen in the Dombe administrative 
region, also in Sussundenga, a populous area of the district, 
where corn is produced abundantly and where there are diverse 
wildlife species. 
  Dombe has been under Renamo control since late 1990, when 
its 
men entered without considerable resistance and occupied its 
capital. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] advisers 
to Maputo Province today accused the provincial government of 
hindering the reintegration of areas under Renamo control in 
state administration. Speaking at a news conference, the 
advisers said they had submitted a working program to the 
provincial governor, promising to conclude the reintegration 
process by the end of this month. They said the program will 
not be fulfilled in time however because the provincial 
government does not provide transportation to carry out work in 
areas under Renamo control. They also spoke about the problems 
of housing, lack of direct telephone lines, and transportation 
from house to work and vice versa. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The government demands that the Cease-Fire 
Commission [CCF] immediately investigate the disappearance of 
(Renuge Paconote), main witness of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo] in the accusation that the Mozambican 
Government is training a battalion in Nachingwea. In the 
document, the government's delegation to the CCF says Renamo's 
verbal accusation that the government abducted (Renuge Paconote) 
in the city of Nampula is outrageous. The government delegation 
says it regrets the undignified attitude of the head of the 
Renamo delegation to the commission and adds that to make 
unfounded accusations, kidnap witnesses, and pretend to be 
innocent is to be simultaneously plaintiff and judge. (Renuge 
Paconote), a former government soldier, has alleged that the 
government is training a battalion in Tanzania. He went missing 
after the first session on the issue was held. In the CCF 
meeting held on 19 May the government requested the suspension 
of the investigations on the alleged training of the battalion 
because the main witness was missing.

  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], has urged the residents of Pebane District, 
Zambezia Province, to forget about the war. Addressing a mass 
rally in Pebane yesterday, Dhlakama guaranteed that war will 
never be renewed in the country and added that the objectives 
for which he fought were attained with the implementation of 
democracy in Mozambique. On the occasion, the Renamo leader 
urged the Pebane residents to participate actively in the 
forthcoming multiparty elections. Dhlakama, who has been in 
Quelimane since 20 May, is scheduled to close Renamo's political 
conference, which has been discussing particularly issues linked 
to the electoral process. The conference was attended by Renamo 
political delegates in Zambezia and Nampula Provinces.

  [Text] A group of demobilized government troops staged a 
demonstration along the main streets of the city of Chimoio in 
Manica Province today, demanding payment of pensions in arrears. 
The group then left for the provincial government building, 
along the main avenue of the city, 25 de Setembro. 
  Our reporting team says the names of some former guerrillas 
of the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] do not appear on 
the pension lists received from Maputo. A source from the 
Provincial Finance Directorate also told our reporting team that 
there are some irregularities in some lists which show some 
demobilized soldiers with a longer period of service earning 
less than those who served for lesser period.

  [Text] The Cease-Fire Commission [CCF] has decided to 
continue investigating the alleged training of a battalion of 
government troops in Tanzania, following complaints by the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] in April. In its 
report, Renamo named a witness who is now missing. The 
government does not agree with continuing the investigations, 
saying that this should take place only if the missing witness 
is presented. The commission -- made up of government, Renamo, 
and UN members -- worked twice with Renamo's witness in Nampula. 
Raul Dique, Renamo's representative in the CCF, said that 
(Renuge Paconote), who was living under Renamo protection, 
requested to visit his family, with whom he spent the night. 
Brigadier Dique says that on the following day, 10 May, the 
witness went missing. 
  Renamo believes that (Renuge Paconote) was detained or 
killed 
by the government to hinder the investigations of the alleged 
training of a military battalion in Tanzania. Renamo says that 
the troops would be used should the Mozambique Liberation Front 
lose the October elections. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Ozorio Mateus of the government 
delegation 
in the CCF believes that the absence of the alleged Renamo 
witness hinders the continuation of the investigation of the 
Tanzania battalion issue. Ozorio Mateus said that on previous 
occasions Renamo alleged violations of the General Peace Accord 
by the government, but nothing has been proved on the ground.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "President Again Begs Abroad"] </F>
  [Text] The Presiden?, Mr. Sam Nujoma, in Brussels 
yesterday, on a working visit to Belgium and the European 
Commission, requested that Namibia's present status as ab 
underdeveloped country be extended for another five years due to 
poor economic development since independence, following the 
severe effects of the drought and the global economic recession. 
  He also applied for a bigger export quota for seedless 
grapes 
for the European market, assistance with the expansion of the 
NBC [Namibian Broadcasting Corporation] transmission network, 
and an additional 2 million EC [European Currency] Units for the 
completion of the part of the Trans-Caprivi highway funded by 
the European Union (EU). 
  Concerning the issue of underdeveloped status, he said that 
this "status" should be granted to Namibia to enable the country 
to overcome economic hitches experienced in the first few 
critical years after independence, adding that economic 
indicators did not reflect changes which the country hoped for. 
  "We therefore intend to apply for the extension of this 
status for the second half of the Lome IV Convention." 
  President Nujoma said that the country benefited from the 
least developed country [last three words in English] status 
over the past five years and from the special treatment given to 
countries in terms of Article 329 of the Lome IV Convention. 
"To my deepest regret expectations were not realized. Namibia 
experienced a serious setback because of two unforeseen 
developments -- the drought and the global recession which 
retarded our economic advancement." 
  The president made a personal request to the vice president 
of the Economic Commission, Mr. Manuel Marin, to support 
Namibia's application according to the Lome IV revision 
agreements. Mr. Nujoma addressed a luncheon hosted by Mr. Marin. 
  The President said that Namibia had every reason to be proud 
of its relationship with the EU, especially against the 
background of the 525 million Namibian dollar aid package 
granted to Namibia since independence, in accordance with the 
Lome Convention. "The real challenge in dialogue on development 
issues between the EU and the ACP countries 
(African-Caribbean-Pacific) did not concern the issue of 
assistance, but trade -- in particular, the matter of duty free 
access of goods destined for the European market." 
  "In this regard I am reminded of Namibia's request to 
deliver 
duty free seedless grapes to the European market out of season, 
when there will not necessarily be any competition with European 
products. The EU's reaction was not exactly encouraging because 
the European Commission only proposed a quota of 500 tonnes 
while Namibia has the potential to deliver a quota of 5,000 
tonnes." 
  "I am mentioning this particular aspect because it embodies 
the spirit of the Lome Convention in that it provides work for 
approximately 7,000 people in the south of the country. It also 
promotes agricultural and rural development and encourages 
private initiative, in respect to private investment in an ACP 
country. This bold private sector initiative, supported by 
capital from two EU members, namely the United Kingdom and 
Germany, must be supported so that it can succeed. I am, 
therefore, calling on the commission to reconsider its position 
and to create a duty free opportunity for Namibia." 
  Co?cerning the expansion of the NBC transmission network, 
Mr. 
Nujoma requested that a consultant be provided to assist with 
this task. "It is our dream to put up transmitters countrywide 
for the education of our people." -- The ACP group of 
developing countries and the European Union are meeting from 
today for three days in Mbabane, Swaziland, for the medium-term 
revision of the Lome IV aid and trade agreements over 10 years, 
to expire in the year 2000.

  [Excerpt] Chief Nhloko Zwane of Mpuluzi has said there is a 
plot to topple the Monarch. The chief said the plot involves 
certain influential people he did not name, saying of late 
meetings are being held by the plotters and that such meetings 
are disguised as parties. 
  Chief Nhloko who is also a member of the Defence Council in 
the Army made these remarks when addressing the Prime Minister, 
Prince Mbilini during the introduction of National and Regional 
Crime Prevention Councils at the Manzini City Council Chambers 
-- for the people of Manzini. The meeting was attended by 
Chiefs their Tindvuna [headmen] and Councillors -- as well as 
senior Government officials and Cabinet Ministers. 
  He told the meeting that King Sobhuza II was fortunate 
because there were no such plotters in his time -- adding that 
he is still ruling the country even today. 
  Chief Nhloko warned Chiefs specifically, not to be involved 
in the plot. "Chiefs should stand up and fight these elements. 
It is their duty to protect the monarch because the elements 
behind this plan are their subjects and children," he said.

  [Text] Abidjan, 24 May (AFP) -- The Abidjan district court 
today sentenced David Deliwa Gogbe, editing manager of the 
weekly LE CHANGEMENT, a paper with ties to opposition parties, 
to one year in jail for slandering a top dignitary of the regime. 
  In the article, LE CHANGEMENT implicated Germain 
Coffi-Gadeau, the grand chancellor of the national order and a 
close associate of the late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, in 
a criminal case. 
  Mr. Gogbe, who appeared before the court freely, was jailed. 
He is the seventh Ivorian journalist to be jailed since 
February. Four journalists have been found guilty of slandering 
the head of state, and two have been found guilty of disrupting 
public order.

  [Text] Abidjan, 24 May (AFP) -- The Abidjan Court of 
Appeals today confirmed the three-year prison terms given on 21 
April to Abou Drahamane Sangare and Souleymane Senn, editing 
manager and reporter, respectively, for the daily LA VOIE, a 
paper with ties to the social democratic opposition. Mr. 
Sangare is the assistant secretary general of the main 
opposition party, the Ivorian Popular Front. The two men, 
jailed since 13 April, were found guilty of "inciting to 
violence" and "disturbing the public peace." On 5 April, LA 
VOIE published an editorial comment by Souleymann Senn entitled: 
"The Balance of Terror," which called on the opposition "to 
render the country ungovernable in order to make the ruling 
party realize that it is contending with a force which is, at 
least, equal to it in strength." 
  The assistant public prosecutor declared today that the 
sentence should "serve as a lesson, and deter all those who 
intend to embark on a similar path." 
  Messrs. Sangare and Senn, along with three other LA VOIE 
correspondents, had already been given one-year jail terms on 24 
March for "offensive language against the head of state," Mr. 
Henri Konan Bedie. However, at that time, the court did not 
issue a bench warrant against them, and they were not 
incarcerated. 
  At its congress held last week, the Cote d'Ivoire Union of 
Journalists deplored the harshness of the Press Act, and urged 
President Bedie to show mercy on the sentenced persons.

  [Text] Fighting is reported to be intensifying between 
ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and 
the Lofa Defense Force in Lofa County. Thousands of displaced 
people fleeing the fighting in the country have reportedly 
arrived in Monrovia and other parts of the country. Reports say 
the intensification of the fighting stems from an attack 
launched against the Lofa Defense Force by ULIMO. Recently a 
spokesman for the Lofa Defense Force said his forces have 
flushed out Mandingo fighters of Alhaji Koromah from several 
parts of Lofa County, including Zorzor, (Fezebu), and other 
areas along the Guinea-Liberia border.

  [Text] Lagos, 24 May (AFP) -- A group of 17 pro-democracy 
activists arrested during an election of delegates to a 
constitutional conference called by the military regime, 
appeared in court here on Tuesday [24 May] to be formally 
charged, a human rights activist said. They were charged with 
attempting to disrupt the election, unlawful assembly and 
causing a breach of the peace, said the human rights activist, 
who is a lawyer. 
  The arrested activists -- who included Tokunbo Afikuyomi, a 
special assistant to Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe, Senator 
Bola Tinubu and Olusegun Mayegun ex-president of the National 
Association of Nigerian Students -- were arrested in several 
parts of Lagos during the election exercise on Monday. Twelve 
of them were granted bail after paying a mandatory fine of 
10,000 naira (455 dollars) imposed on them by the Yaba 
magistrates (lower) court, said the source. 
  Meanwhile, a 17-year-old pro-democracy activist, Sunday Saji 
also arrested on Monday is still being detained, a statement by 
the Campaign for Democracy (CD) said. The CD, which is the 
umbrella group for about 40 human rights and pro-democracy 
associations in Nigeria, called for the immediate release of the 
teenager. 
  Pro-democracy groups called for a boycott of the elections 
held at ward level on Monday for the constitutional conference. 
Instead they want the military to step down and a sovereign 
national conference to be convened to debate the country's 
future.

  [Excerpts] Dakar, 24 May (KNA/PANA) -- Senegal is ready to 
help restore peace in Rwanda through an increased participation 
in the United Nations Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), its 
president, Abdou Diouf, said in Dakar today. 
  Speaking on his return from a three-day visit in the USA, 
where he was given an honorary doctorate at the University of 
Connecticut, the Senegalese head of state however said Senegal 
must have the necessary material support if it is to make an 
increased contribution to helping restore peace in the war-torn 
country. 
  "As with other countries, we have been approached by the 
U.N. 
and we are going to increase our participation to the United 
Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR), provided that 
material means are given to us to perform our mission," said 
Diouf. [passage omitted] 
  Senegal, which has often participated in peacekeeping 
missions, currently has about ten officers in the U.N. Mission 
in Rwanda.

  [Text] Freetown, 24 May (AFP) -- At least 50 rebels in 
Sierra Leone were killed recently in mysterious circumstances, 
diplomats said Tuesday [24 May]. The incident occurred in the 
town of Baomahun, 170 kilometers east of the capital. The town 
was attacked and briefly held three weeks ago by the guerrillas 
of the United Revolutionary Front. One hypothesis suggested by 
diplomats was that the guerrillas died after drinking 
cyanide-tainted alcohol they had robbed from a gold mine. The 
mine personnel had fled ahead of the insurgent attack. 
  The rebels have been fighting the government of this small 
West African country since March 1991. Since the beginning of 
May, apart from the latest 50, 67 guerrillas have died in 
clashes with government forces, the government says. Sixty-five 
civilians and 10 soldiers have also died.

<F P=106> [Address by President Nelson Mandela at the opening of </F>
parliament in Cape Town on 24 May -- live] 
  [Text] Madam speaker, and deputy speaker, president of the 
Senate, and deputy president, deputy presidents, chief justice, 
distinguished members of the National Assembly, and the Senate, 
provincial premiers, commanders of the security forces, members 
of the diplomatic corps, esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen. 
  The time will come when our nation will honor the memory of 
all the sons, the daughters, the mothers, the fathers, the youth 
and the children, who by their thoughts and deeds gave us the 
right to assert with pride that we are South Africans, that we 
are Africans, and that we are citizens of the world. 
  The certainties that come with age tell me that among these 
we shall find an Afrikaner woman who transcended a particular 
experience and became a South African, an African, and a citizen 
of the world. Her name is Ingrid Jonker. She was both a poet 
and a South African. She was both an Afrikaner and an African. 
She was both an artist and a human being. In the midst of 
despair she celebrated hope. Confronted by death, she asserted 
the beauty of life. In the dark days when all seemed hopeless 
in our country, when many refused to hear her resonant choice, 
she took her own life. To her and others like her we owe a debt 
for life itself. To her and others like her we owe a commitment 
to the poor, the oppressed, the wretched, and the despised. 
  In the aftermath of the massacre at the anti-pass 
demonstration in Sharpeville, she wrote, and I quote: The child 
is not dead, the child lifts his fist against his mother, who 
shouts Africa! The child is not dead, not at Langa, not at 
Nyanga, nor at Orlando, nor at Sharpeville, nor at the police 
post at Phillippi where she [as heard] lies with a bullet 
through his brain. The child is present at all assemblies and 
law giving. The child peers through the windows of houses and 
into the hearts of mothers. The child who only wanted to play 
in the sun at Nyanga is everywhere. The child, grown to a man, 
tracks on through all Africa. The child, grown into a giant, 
journeys over the whole world without a pass, unquote. 
  And in this glorious vision she instructs that our 
endeavors must be about the liberation of the woman, the 
emancipation of the man, and the liberty of the child. It is 
these things that we must achieve to give meaning to our 
presence in this chamber and to give purpose to our occupancy of 
the seat of government. And so we must, constrained by and yet 
regardless of the accumulated effect of our historical 
background, seize the time to define for ourselves what we want 
to make of our shared destiny. 
  A government had the honor to lead, and I dare say, the 
masses who elected us to serve in this role are inspired by the 
single vision of creating a people centered society. 
Accordingly, the purpose that will drive the government -- this 
government -- shall be the expansion of the frontiers of human 
fulfillment, the continuous extension of the frontiers of 
freedom, the acid test of the legitimacy of the programs we 
elaborate. The government institutions we create, the 
legislation we adopt must be whether they serve these 
objectives. Our single most important challenge is therefore to 
help establish a social order in which the freedom of the 
individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual. We 
must construct that people centered society of freedom in such a 
manner that it guarantees the political liberty and the human 
rights of all our citizens. The provisions expressive of these 
noble goals already exist in the transitional constitution. It 
will be the task of the Constitutional Assembly to revisit this 
issue to ensure that we have all the necessary constitutional 
instruments that will guarantee that none can take away or in 
any way restrict the freedoms and rights of any of our people. 
  As an affirmation of our government's commitment to an 
entrenched human right culture, we shall immediately take steps 
to inform the secretary general of the United Nations that we 
will subscribe to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 
addition, we will take steps to ensure that we accede to the 
international covenant on civil and political rights, the 
international covenant on social and economic rights and other 
human rights' instruments of the United Nations. Our definition 
of the freedom of the individual must be instructed by the 
fundamental objective to restore the human dignity of each and 
every South African. This requires that we speak not only of 
political freedoms. My government's commitment to create a 
peoples-centered society of liberty binds us to the pursuit of 
the goals of freedom from want, freedom from hunger, freedom 
from deprivation, freedom from ignorance, freedom from 
suppression, and freedom from fear. 
  These freedoms are fundamental to the guarantee of human 
dignity. They will therefore constitute part of the centerpiece 
of what this government will seek to achieve, the focal point on 
which our attention will be continuously focused. The things we 
have said constitute the true meaning, the justification and the 
purpose of the reconstruction and development program, without 
which it would lose all legitimacy. When we elaborated this 
program, we were inspired by the hope that all South Africans of 
good will could join together to provide a better life for all. 
We were pleased that other political organizations announced 
similar aims. Today I'm happy to announce that the covenant of 
the government of national unity has reached a consensus not 
only on the broad objective of the creation of the 
peoples-centered society of which I've spoken, but also on many 
elements of a plan, broadly based on the Program for 
Reconstruction and Development. 
  Let me indicate some of the more important agreements. 
Annually in the combined budgets of central government and the 
provinces, we will provide for an increasing amount of funding 
for the plan. This will start with the appropriation of 2.5 
billion rands in the 1994/95 budget that will be presented next 
month. This should rise to more than 10 billion by the fifth 
year of the life of this government. Government will also use 
its own allocation of funds to the Reconstruction and 
Development Plan to exact maximum leverage in marshalling funds 
from within South Africa and abroad. 
  In this regard I am pleased to report that we have been 
holding consultations with some of the principal business 
leaders of our country. Consequently, we are assured that the 
business sector will make a significant contribution toward the 
structuring and management of such reconstruction and 
development funds toward the effective identification and 
implementation of projects, and by supporting the financing of 
the socioeconomic development effort. 
  I am also pleased to report that many of our friends abroad 
have already made commitments to assist us to generate the 
reconstruction and development funds we need. We thank them 
most sincerely for their positive attitude which arises, not 
from objectives of charity, but from the desire to express 
solidarity with the new society we seek to build. We accept the 
duty of coordinating the management of the total resources that 
will be generated without seeking to prescribe to other 
contributants or undermining the continued role of 
nongovernmental organizations and community based organizations. 
  The initial 2.5 billion rands will be found from savings and 
the re-direction of spending as included in the preliminary 
1994/95 budget proposals presented to the cabinet. I would like 
to thank all the departments of state for their cooperation in 
carrying out this adjustment to their planning at short notice. 
As we allocate larger amounts in future we shall require 
further adjustments by departments, partly to correct the bias 
in the spending patterns which are a legacy of the past. The 
longer period should allow such changes to be properly planned, 
but they will still make great demands on the managerial 
capacity and spirit of cooperation of the cabinet and the whole 
civil service. 
  [Begins speaking in Afrikaans] We are truly confident the 
state service is inspired by the desire to serve the community. 
That it will carry out its responsibility with dedication, 
zealousness and enthusiasm, including the building up of greater 
efficiency and greater productivity. This government is 
therefore bound to ensure that this period will be properly 
utilized, and will include community structures in the 
decision-making process. [ends Afrikaans] 
  This will include the trade union movements and civic 
organizations so that at no time should the government become 
isolated from the people. At the same time steps will be taken 
to build the capacity of communities to manage their own 
affairs. Precisely because we are committed to ensuring 
sustainable growth and development leading to a better life for 
all, we will continue existing programs of fiscal 
rehabilitation. We are therefore determined to make every 
effort to contain real general government consumption at present 
levels and to manage the budget deficit with a view to its 
continuous reduction. Similarly we are agreed that a 
permanently higher general level of taxation is to be avoided. 
To achieve this important objective will require consistent 
discipline on the part of both the central and the provincial 
government. Furthermore, this disciplined approach will ensure 
that we integrate the objectives of our Reconstruction and 
Development Plan within government expenditure and not treat 
them as incidental to the task of government marginalized to the 
status of mere additions to the level of expenditure. 
  There are major areas of desperate need in our society. As a 
signal of its seriousness to address this the government will, 
within the next hundred days, implement various projects under 
the direct provision of the president. Let me briefly explain 
this. Children under the age of six and pregnant mothers will 
receive free medical care in every state hospital and clinic 
where such need exists. Similarly, a nutrition feeding scheme 
will be implemented in every primary school where such a need is 
established. 
  A concrete process of consultation between the major stake 
holders in this area will be organized immediately. A program 
is already being implemented to electrify 350,000 homes during 
the current financial year. A campaign will be launched at 
every level of government, a public works program designed, and 
all efforts made to involve the private sector, organized labor, 
the civics, and other community organizations to rebuild our 
townships, restore services in rural and urban areas, while 
addressing the issue of job creation and training especially for 
our unemployed youths. Many details of the overall 
Reconstruction and Development Plan remain to be discussed, 
agreed and put in place, but I believe that the broad outline I 
have given, and the immediate initiates I have mentioned will 
allow you to share my joy at the progress already made by the 
government of national unity with regard to this important 
matter. We shall carry out this plan within the context of a 
policy aimed at building a strong and growing economy which will 
benefit all our people. 
  I'd like to deal with a few matters in this regard. In 
support of sustainable economic growth and the macro-economic 
objectives, it will remain the primary objective of monetary 
policy to promote and maintain overall financial stability. The 
Reserve Bank has the important function of protecting the value 
of our currency and striving for relative price stability at all 
times. We are pleased that Dr. Chris Stals will continue to 
serve as governor of the Reserve Bank. 
  The battle to reduce the rate of inflation will continue. 
The realization of many of our objectives for a fair and equal 
treatment of all our people will not be possible unless we 
succeed in avoiding high inflation in the economy. We also face 
a major challenge in reentering the global economy, while stable 
prices are vital to the restructuring of our industries and 
dealing with the critical issue of job creation. We are 
blessed with a heritage of a sophisticated financial sector. 
Our financial markets are well palced to play an important part 
in the allocation of scarce funds to give effect to our economic 
development program. It is however also necessary that we think 
in new ways to meet the challenges of reconstruction and 
development. We therefore welcome recent developments that 
provide for the creation of community banks. We would also like 
to encourage the greater participation of established financial 
institutions in the important area of black economic empowerment 
and support for the development of small and medium business. 
The latter two areas of economic activity will receive the 
greatest attention of the government because of their importance 
in deracializing and democratizing the economy and creating the 
jobs which our people need. So we will pay attention to the 
important matter of consumer protection, to shield the ordinary 
people of our country from unscrupulous business practices. 
  It is also clear that we must pay increased attention to 
tourism. The jobs and privileges, the jobs and foreign currency 
which tourism generates will strongly influence our economy. 
The active and imaginative intervention of all stake holders in 
this area of our national life must take advantage of the 
excellent atmosphere created by our peaceful transition to 
democracy to make tourism a major positive force in the future. 
  We look forward to the private sector as a whole playing a 
central role in achieving the significantly high and sustainable 
rates of economic growth to which we have referred. We are 
convinced that the growth prospects of this sector will be 
enhanced by the measures of fiscal discipline contained in our 
approach to the Reconstruction and Development Program, by the 
continued steady course of monetary policy. Furthermore, as 
growth proceeds, more domestic savings will progressively become 
available to finance increased investment at reasonable rates of 
interest. The government is also acutely conscious of the fact 
that we should work firstly to return the capital account of the 
balance of payment to equilibrium and in due course to ensure a 
net in flow of resources consistent with the experience of other 
countries that enjoy more rapid growth rates. 
  The present situation of a dual currency and the existence 
of 
an exchange control apparatus is a direct result of the conflict 
in which our country was embroiled in the past. As the 
situation returns to normal, these arrangements will be 
subjected to critical scrutiny. It should be possible to match 
the steady growth of confidence at home and abroad with other 
confidence enhancing modifications to everybody's benefit. The 
government will also address all other matters that relate to 
the creation of an attractive investment planning for both 
domestic and foreign investments. Conscious of the fact that we 
have to compete with the rest of the world in terms of 
attracting, in particular, foreign direct investment. I'm 
pleased that we've already started to address the important 
questions of our trade policy guided by our GATT commitments and 
the determination systematically to open the economy to global 
competition in a carefully managed process. Soon we will also 
begin trade negotiations with amongst others, the European 
Union, the United States, our partners in the in the Southern 
African Continent Customs Union and our neighbors in the 
Southern African Development Community to provide stable and 
mutually beneficial framework for our international economic 
relations. We will also be looking very closely at the question 
of enhancing South-South Cooperation in general as part of the 
effort to expand our economic links with the rest of the world. 
  Consistent with our objective of creating a people- 
centered society, and effectively to address the critical 
questions of growth, reconstruction and development, we will 
together with organized labor and the private sector, pay 
special attention to the huge issue of human resource 
development. Both the public and private sector will be 
encouraged to regard labor as a resource and not a cost. 
Education and training must therefore be looked at very closely 
to ensure that we empower the workers, raise productivity levels 
and meet the skills, needs, of a modern economy. Important work 
will have to be done in and significant resources devoted to the 
areas of science and technology, including research and 
development. Government is also convinced that organized labor 
is an important partner whose cooperation is crucial for the 
reconstruction and development of our country. That partnership 
requires, amongst other things, that our Labor Law be reformed 
so that it is in line with international standards, apartheid 
vestiges are removed and a more harmonious labor relations 
dispensation is created on the basis of tripartite cooperation 
between government, labor and capital. 
  The government is determined forcefully to confront the 
scourge of unemployment, not by way of handouts, but by the 
creation of work opportunities. The government will also deal 
sensitively with the issue of population movements into the 
country. To protect our workers, to guard against the 
exploitation of vulnerable workers, and to ensure friendly 
relations with all countries and peoples the government is also 
taking urgent measures to deal firmly with drug trafficking, 
some of which is carried out by foreign nationals who are 
resident in the country. We must end racism in the work place, 
as part of our common offensive against racism in general. No 
more should words like kaffirs, Hottentots, coolies, boy, girl 
and boss be part of our vocabulary. I also trust that the 
matter of paying the workers for the public holidays proclaimed 
in order to ensure their participation in the election and the 
inauguration ceremonies will now be resolved as a result of 
recent consultation. This will be a welcome demonstration by 
the private sector of its involvement in the beautiful future we 
are all trying to build. 
  We have devoted time to a discussion of economic questions 
because they are fundamental to the realization of the 
fundamental objectives of the Reconstruction and Development 
Program. Below I mention some of the work in which the relevant 
governments are already involved to translate these objectives 
into realities. The government will take steps to ensure the 
provision of clean water on the basis of the principle of water 
security for all and the introduction of proper sanitation 
sensitive to the protection of the environment. 
  We are determined to address the dire housing shortage in a 
vigorous manner, acting together with the private sectors and 
the communities in need of shelter. 
  Health also remains the fundamental building block of the 
humane society we are determined to create through the 
implementation of the Reconstruction and Development Program. 
We must address the needs of the aged and the disabled, uplift 
disadvantaged sectors, such as the women and the youth, and 
improve the lives of our people in the rural communities and the 
informal settlements. We must invest substantial amounts in 
education and training and meet our commitment to introduce free 
and compulsory education for a period of at least nine years. 
Everywhere we must reinculcate the culture of learning and of 
teaching, and make it possible for this culture to thrive. We 
must combat such social fatalities as widespread poverty, the 
breakdown of family life, crime, alcohol, and drug abuse, the 
abuse of children, women and the elderly, and the painful 
reality of street children. We are giving urgent attention to 
the long waiting list for the payment of social grants which 
have developed in some areas owing to lack of funds. I am 
especially pleased that we have a ministry dedicated to the 
issue of the environment. Its work must impact on many aspects 
of national activity and address the question of the wellbeing 
of society as a whole and the preservation of a healthy 
environmental future, even for generations not yet born. 
  As we begin this address, we borrowed the words of Ingrid 
Jonker to focus on the plight of the children of the country. I 
would now like to say that the government will, as a matter of 
urgency, attend to the tragic and complex question of children 
and juveniles in detention and prison. The basci principle from 
which we will proceed from now onwards is that we must rescue 
the children of the nation and ensure that the system of 
criminal justice must be the very last resort in the case of 
juvenile offenders. 
  I have therefore issued instructions to the departments 
concerned, as a matter of urgency, to work out the necessary 
guidelines which will enable us to empty our prisons of children 
and to place them in suitable alternative care. This is in 
addition to an amnesty for various categories of serving 
prisoners as will be affected in terms of what I said in my 
inauguration address two weeks ago. 
  In this context, I also need to make the point that the 
government will also not delay unduly with regard to attending 
to the vexed and unresolved issues of an amnesty for criminal 
activities carried out in furtherance of political objectives. 
  We will attend to this matter in a balanced and dignified 
way. The nation must come to terms with its past in a spirit of 
openness and forgiveness and proceed to build the future on the 
basis of repairing and healing. The burden of the past lies 
heavily on all of us, including those responsible for inflicting 
injury and those who suffered. 
  Following the letter and spirit of the constitution, we will 
prepare the legislation which will seek to free the wrongdoers 
from fear of retribution and blackmail, while acknowledging the 
injury of those who have been harmed so that the individual 
wrongs, injuries, fears and hopes affecting individuals are 
identified and attended to. 
  In the meantime, summoning the full authority of the 
position 
we represent, we call on all concerned not to take any step that 
might, in any way, impede or compromise the processes of 
reconciliation which the impending legislation will address. 
  The problem of politically motivated violence is still with 
us. We depend on our country's security forces to deal with this 
problem using all resources at their disposal. In this, and in 
their efforts to deal especially with criminal violence, they 
have our personal support and confidence. 
  We have also directed that all relevant ministries should 
engage the structures set up in terms of the national peace 
accord so that these can be invigorated to pursue their noble 
mission in the context of the changed circumstances in our 
country. 
  The government will otherwise not spare any effort in 
ensuring that our security forces enjoy the standing they 
deserve of being accepted by all our people the defenders of our 
sovereignty, our democratic system, the guarantors of a just 
peace within the country and the safety and security of all 
citizens and their property. 
  Let me also take this opportunity to reiterate our assurance 
to the rest of the public service that the government is firmly 
committed to the protection of the rights of all members of this 
service. We are also determined to work with the organisations 
of the service to ensure that we have the democratic, 
non-racial, non-sexist, honest and accountable corps of public 
servants which members of the public service themselves desire. 
  In this context, we must also make the observation that the 
government will not waver from the principle of achieving parity 
in remuneration and conditions of service among all workers in 
the public sector. 
  The youth of our country are the valued possession of the 
nation. Without them there can be no future. Their needs are 
immense and urgent. They are at the center of our reconstruction 
and development plan. 
  To address them, acting with the youth themselves, the 
government will engage the representative organisations of the 
youth and other formations, among other things to look at the 
siting of a broad-based national commission on youth development 
among the structures of government. Building on this base the 
government and the commission would then work together to ensure 
that the nurturing of our youth stands at the centre of our 
reconstruction and development, without being consigned to a 
meaningless ghetto of public life. 
  Similar considerations must attach to the equally important 
question of the emancipation of the women of our country. It is 
vitally important that all structure of government, including 
the president himself, should understand this fully that freedom 
cannot be achieved unless the women have been emancipated from 
all forms of oppression. 
  All of us must take this on board that the objectives of the 
Reconstruction and Development Programme will not have been 
realised unless we see in visible and practical terms that the 
condition of the women of our country has radically changed for 
the better and that they have been empowered to intervene in 
all aspects of life as equals with any other member of society. 
  In addition to the establishment of the statutory gender 
commission provided for in the constitution, the government 
will, together with the representatives of the women themselves, 
look at the establishment of organs of government to ensure that 
all levels of the public sector, from top to bottom, integrate 
the central issue of the emancipation of women in their 
programmes and daily activities. 
  Tomorrow, on Africa Day, the dream of Ingrid Jonker will 
come 
to fruition. The child grown to a man will trek through all 
Africa. The child grown to a journey will journey all over the 
world -- without a pass! 
  Tomorrow, on Africa Day, our new flag will be hoisted in an 
historic ceremony at the OAU headquarters in Addis Ababa, with 
the OAU having already agreed to accept us as its latest member. 
[applause] 
  Tomorrow, on Africa Day, the UN Security Council will meet 
to 
lift the last remaining sanctions against South Africa and to 
position the world organisation to relate to our country as an 
honoured, responsible and peace-loving citizen. 
  As such, the government is involved in discussion to 
determine what our contribution could be to the search for peace 
in Angola and Rwanda; to the reinforcement of the peace process 
in Mozambique; to the establishment of a new world order of 
mutually beneficial cooperation, justice, prosperity and peace 
for ourselves and for the nations of the world. 
  Yesterday the cabinet also decided to apply for our country 
to join the Commonwealth. This important community of nations is 
waiting to receive us with open arms. 
  We have learnt the lesson that out blemishes speak of what 
all humanity should not do. We understand this fully that our 
glories point to the heights of what human genius can achieve. 
  In our dreams we have vision of all our country at play in 
our sportsfields and enjoying deserved and enriching recreation 
in our theaters, galleries, beaches, mountains, plains and game 
parks, in conditions of peace, security and comfort. 
  Our road to that glorious future lies through collective 
hard 
work to accomplish the objective of creating a people-centred 
society through the implementation of the vision contained in 
our Reconstruction and Development Plan. 
  Let us all get down to work! 
  I declare this session of Parliament formerly open.

  [Text] Reaction by political leaders to President Mandela's 
speech was generally positive. Some parties expressed concern 
over the implementation of the Reconstruction and Development 
Plan and the amnesty issue. But politicians across the 
political spectrum said it would boost investor confidence. 
  [Correctional Services spokesman Sipho Mzimela] I think it 
was a very comprehensive speech. It dealt with all the major 
areas which government has to attend to and it touched on the 
major issues and problems which are facing the county. So in 
that sense I think it's a very good speech. 
  [Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen in Afrikaans] I think 
the reconstruction program which President Mandela talks about 
is a very ambitious plan. He is talking about big amounts of 
money. I hope it will be possible. For it to become possible 
will entirely depend on a, Foreign aid, and b, to what extent 
our economy is going to produce. There is quite a strong 
feeling among many people that the economy can pick up strongly. 
I hope that will be the case because if the economy is not 
strong, then we will not be in a position to get this 
reconstruction program off the ground. 
  [Minister Without portfolio Jay Naidoo] I believe it's a 
very 
realistic program. It offers us a kick start to the 
Reconstruction Development Program and we are wanting to deliver 
the goods now. And that is what the president has instructed us 
to do, and that is what we are going to do. 
  [Democratic Party acting leader Tony Leon] The Democratic 
Party is very encouraged by the tone and by the content of the 
speech. We think President Mandela went a long way toward 
reassuring all the communities which need to be brought into 
nation-building and reconciliation, particularly the financial 
and investment community. 
  [Pan Africanist Congress leader Clarence Makwetu] Well, it 
is 
not easy for me to comment on the speech as it is, but it was a 
well balanced one because it covered quite a number of issues 
affecting our country -- the issues like health, gender issues, 
education, unemployment, housing etcetera. And these are the 
issues we need to address. 
  [Environmental Affairs, Tourism Minister Dawie de Villiers] 
I 
think it is a speech that will encourage confidence. The 
president succeeded in marrying the objectives of the 
Reconstruction and Development Program with sound economic and 
financial management. I believe the speech will be well 
received by the private sector. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Congress of South African Trade Unions, COSATU, Press </F>
Statement on President Mandela's Speech issued on the SAPA PR 
Wire Service] 
  [Text] President Mandela's opening speech in Parliament 
today sent an electric wave of hope around South Africa. It was 
truly the speech of a people's president, reflecting his concern 
first and foremost for the ordinary people of this land. In 
particular it will be greeted with enormous enthusiasm by 
working people. 
  The speech placed the Reconstruction and Development 
Programme [RDP] firmly on the agenda as the cornerstone of 
government policy over the next five years. COSATU pledges its 
wholehearted support and undivided energy in ensuring the 
success of this programme, and believes that the overwhelming 
majority of South Africans want it to succeed. Indeed it was 
extremely encouraging to hear that the entire cabinet of 
national unity have come out in support of the RDP. 
  COSATU was also encouraged by the president's undertaking to 
immediately put in place certain short-term measures which will 
within the year begin to make an impact on the lives of working 
people. These include the implementation of public works 
programmes, the building of houses and infrastructure, health 
programmes, training and education, and reorganisation of the 
public service. The emphasis on job creation, together with the 
fight against inflation and consumer protection will be welcomed 
by working people who have been economically battered for so 
many years. 
  COSATU welcomes the undertaking to bring South Africa in 
line 
with international standards, particularly in relation to 
reforming and harmonising our labour legislation. The 
president's speech also encouraged the development of strong 
organisations of civil society, both at trade union and 
community level. 
  His comments on the economy and financing the RDP were 
imbued 
with a vision of economic development which serves people. It is 
clear that the government of national unity aims to reorient 
priorities, and allocation of resources, to primarily address 
the need to attack poverty, and ensure sustainable economic 
development. 
  We are hopeful that President Mandela's comments on 
unleashing the economic potential of all our countries people 
will help to lay the basis for a new relationship between 
employers and workers. The spirit of his comments are that 
democratisation of the economy are as important as political 
democratisation. This approach can only help to reinforce the 
need for more effective worker participation in decisions on 
issues affecting their daily lives.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Nelson Mandela by SABC announcers, </F>
Leslie Mashokwe and Ameen Akhalwaya on 24 May; place not given; 
From the "Agenda" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] Good evening to you Mr. President and 
welcome. 
  [Mandela] Good evening. 
  [Mashokwe] And with me here is my colleague, the editor of 
Agenda, Mr. Ameen Akhalwaya. Good evening to you. 
  [Akhalwaya] Good evening Leslie. Good evening, President. 
  [Mandela] Good evening. 
  [Akhalwaya] President Nelson Mandela, when you say that it's 
a nightmare come true for hundreds of thousands of people in 
this country, it's also a dream come true for millions of people 
in this country. What does that mean to you, President Nelson 
Mandela, president of the Republic of South Africa? 
  [Mandela] That appellation arouses mixed feelings. The 
feeling of joy and even excitement, that our struggles have come 
to fruition, the day for which we have prayed so hard and long. 
It is the fulfillment of a dream and we are excited. At the 
same time there is a note of sadness, because some of the men 
and women who have made this day possible are not here to 
rejoice with us. One wishes you could arouse everybody in order 
to participate in this historic event. So we accept the new 
status with mixed feelings. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, at what stage did you feel a sense 
of fulfillment. Take us step by step from the day you voted, to 
the day you were inaugurated as president, and then to today 
when you are now president, and you are president of an all race 
democratically elected assembly of South Africa? 
  [Mandela] I don't think it's realistic to point to any 
specific hour or minute which you could regard as a day of 
fulfillment. It has been a process from the moment in which we 
established the liberation army. Its operations, the role on 
the part of our people, both inside prison and outside prison, 
inside the country and abroad, the support we received from the 
international community, built up the hope that we would return 
and that the day of fulfillment will come. And what has 
happened on the 10th of May is merely the culmination of a 
process where we felt certain that the day of fulfillment will 
come. 
  [Mashokwe] In your state of the nation address today you 
emphasized the need for a people-orientated policy which the 
government will be pursuing. You also emphasized the need for 
individual freedom. Does this fly in the face of people who 
would want to be communities, as a group like the Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front] or people with those ideologies? 
  [Mandela] Well, I am convinced that the Bill of Rights, 
which 
we have now adopted, makes full provision for the protection of 
basic human rights for all South Africans irrespective of the 
national group to which they belong. The rights of citizenship 
are all fully guaranteed in that Bill of Rights, and there is no 
necessity for people to demand protection as a group. Those are 
merely the vestiges of a racist approach which we have to try to 
address. I am having discussions with leaders from the 
ultra-right. I have had discussions shortly after the 
announcement of the results with General Constand Viljoen. I 
have also had discussions last Friday with Dr. Ferdi 
Hartzenberg. I am meeting him again tomorrow. I have to address 
their fears, and that is what I'm busy with. It is not 
sufficient for me to say we have made provision for all 
individuals in the Bill of Rights. One has to enter into 
negotiations in order to reach a settlement which will allay the 
fears of everybody and it is in this spirit that I'm having 
discussions with these leaders. 
  [Akhalwaya] Mr. President, before the elections the Freedom 
Front and the ANC entered into an agreement that there would be 
a volkstaat [homeland] council that the Freedom Front could set 
up. How far has that progressed and what is it's actual role 
going to be within Parliament? 
  [Mandela] We want firstly to find out facts on the basis on 
which we can address the demand. We must ascertain how many 
people, in particular how many Afrikaners, are behind this 
demand. If it is a minority, then we have one way of addressing 
the problem. If it is a majority of the Afrikaners, however 
much we may think that that demand is misplaced, we have a 
different attitude toward that demand. And therefore this 
council is intended to ascertain how much support this demand 
can command among the masses of the people on behalf of which it 
is intended to be put forward. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, in your speech today you alluded 
to 
the fact that about 2.5 billion rands will be appropriated this 
year for the Reconstruction and Development Program. Estimates 
run at about 80 to 90 billion being needed for that program to 
be brought to fruition. How are you going to finance the 
deficit, the shortfall if you look at about 10 years, five 
years' time you might indicate 10 billion rands. How are you 
going to come up with the shortfall? Is business going to be 
helping you and how committed will they be, together with the 
foreigners? 
  [Mandela] We must not take these figures as being in anyway 
accurate. They do not come from the National Working Committee 
of the ANC. They have been put forward by institutions which, 
although very close to the ANC, nevertheless do not necessarily 
reflect the conclusions reached by the ANC itself. We were not 
in government when these figures were first issued. We are now 
in government. We have access to accurate information and the 
budget which is going to be published on the 22d of June will 
come out with clearly considered figures and it is on the basis 
of what the budget says, that we can now talk of figures. 
  [Mashokwe] But Mr. President, the very civil service that 
is in place is the one that was been (?unfairly) run by the 
former government two years ago to implement social spending. 
Then how are you going to assure that they will deliver this 
time because in the past their track record is dismal? 
  [Mandela] Unlike the previous government, and I'm not saying 
this in a spirit of criticism, but unlike the previous 
government, the government of national unity is people 
orientated. This Reconstruction and Development Program [RDP] 
emerged from discussions with the masses of the people in 
people's forums, which took place across the length and breadth 
of this country. It is a program which was circulated to a 
wide-range of opinion makers and therefore it is a program which 
is based on consultations with the masses of the people 
themselves, and no government which has attached such importance 
to the participation of the masses themselves in formulating 
this particular plan can therefore take decisions which are 
contrary to the wishes of the people. 
  [Mashokwe] But the civil service that is in place, the [word 
indistinct] that is in place is the very one that did not 
deliver three years ago? 
  [Mandela] Well, what we can say about the National Party 
today, we can say that about the Freedom Front. They were all 
at one time in exactly the same position in which the AWB 
[Afrikaner Resistance Movement] is today. But through dialogue, 
through persuasion, through criticism, we have been able to take 
them on board, and to reach a breakthrough which all of us are 
celebrating today. And it is not a cause for alarm that we 
should find certain sections of our population serving policies 
which have now been renounced by everybody to be able to serve 
the interest of democracy. The National Party today is serving 
the interest of democracy in spite of the fact that they were 
the authors of the most brutal system of racial oppression in 
the history of this country. The civil service that you are 
talking about are themselves now serving the new government of 
national unity. I have received the support of the South 
African Defense Force, the South African Police, and other such 
important security services. I have received the support of the 
civil service, at least those that work with me in the Union 
Buildings, and I have no doubt that reflects the attitude of the 
civil service throughout the country. 
  [Mashokwe] We continue the interview with the president, 
Nelson Mandela, from his Tuynhuys offices in Cape Town. This is 
his first interview since being elected president of South 
Africa. 
  [Akhalwaya] President Mandela, the Reconstruction and 
Development Plan which you said in Parliament today has the 
support of the government of national unity depends a lot on 
partnership -- government, the private sector, civics, and so 
forth, I would say unions. Given the past with P.W. Botha when 
he was president, he had his famous seminars or famous meetings 
with the business sector as well. Earlier the Urban Foundation 
to address the housing shortage and so forth, and yet the 
problems have not only remained but in many cases the problems 
increased. What is so different now that the private sector 
especially will be able to deliver to make the RDP a success? 
  [Mandela] Again I want to draw a clear distinction between 
the previous government and the present government of national 
unity. I have already explained that the Reconstruction and 
Development Program emerges from consultation not only with the 
masses of the people across the length and breadth of this 
country, but also with state institutions, state corporations, 
government departments like the minister of finance, with 
business, consultation with academics. It is a program which 
mirrors the vies of opinion makers in this country, and it is 
for that reason that we are confident that business, both 
locally and abroad, is going to support this program. And we are 
saying so not only from speculations. We are saying so as a 
result of the numerous discussions we've had with business 
inside and outside the country --and the pledges of support 
which we have already received. We also have had extensive 
discussions with the World Bank, the International Monetary 
Fund, industrial organizations and commercial banks throughout 
the world, and massive support has been promised to us, and this 
is quite apart from the funds which are going to be generated 
from savings, from government departments in this country. 
These 2.5 billion rands are as a result of the cooperation from 
government departments in regard to funds that are already 
available and the change in the direction of spending in the 
country. It is for that reason therefore that we are confident 
that we have got the resources. We also have got the support of 
the masses of the people and opinion makers in the country. 
Because of our different approach as compared to the previous 
government -- where we rely on consultation with the people of 
South Africa. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, you touched on the issue of 
amnesty for criminal violence committed in the furtherance of 
political objectives. Does this in any way suggest that you are 
going to extend the deadline for criminal violence which will 
probably mean that Janus Walus, Clive Derby-Lewis will be given 
amnesty as well? 
  [Mandela] Well, firstly, let's take the position very 
clearly. There are three categories of people in regard to whom 
amnesty may be considered. There are those people who committed 
offenses before the 10th of October 1990. Those we have decided 
that, provided they follow a certain procedure, they are 
entitled to amnesty because there are similar categories of 
people before that cut off date who were granted amnesty, and we 
believe that a government of national unity should be 
even-handed and grant amnesty not only to those who committed 
offenses in their opposition to apartheid, but also to those who 
committed offenses in defense of apartheid. But then there are 
those who committed offenses between this cutoff date and 
December 1993. Their indemnity or amnesty is purely at the 
discretion of the government of national unity. But those who 
committed offenses after December 1993, we have no policy at the 
present moment; we have no decision at the present moment as to 
whether they will be granted amnesty. But I must say that our 
intention is to heal the wounds and to ensure that there is 
peace in our country, that everybody cooperates in the task of 
reconciliation and nation building. But cases will be examined 
on their merits. You must remember that in the case of people 
like Walus and Derby-Lewis, they are people who lost their 
beloved in a very cruel manner, in a manner which could have led 
to civil war in this country. And their case therefore is going 
to require special consideration. We, as the African National 
Congress, have openly declared that we are against the death 
sentence and of course that is an offense that was committed 
before we took over the government of the country. We will have 
to balance up issues in the light of our policy, but also in the 
light of the special nature of their offense, bearing in mind 
the people who have lost their beloved, and a country which has 
lost one of the most promising leaders in this country. So the 
question of these two is one that will have to be decided on its 
own facts. 
  [Akhalwaya] Mr. President, can we talk about the people 
outside prison who are still in prison to a large extent. [as 
heard] Your speech emphasized today the development of youth 
and the central role that youth play in the RDP and also the 
question of the emancipation of women. You have also announced 
special feeding schemes for children in need of feeding; you've 
also talked about free medical care for children under the age 
of six. While everybody applauds quite rightly the emphasis on 
youth, there are millions of people in this country who were 
deprived of their youth through the struggle, I'm talking now 
about pensioners, that there is no similar concession being 
extended to them in terms of your speech. Now surely in terms of 
the difficulties they are undergoing, queuing for long hours 
just to collect pensions for medical treatment and so forth, 
that similar concessions should be extended to them? 
  [Mandela] There are many issues of importance in this 
country 
which were not mentioned in this speech, not because they are 
not important, but because other policy had been made clear in 
countless speeches before today. 
  The question of pensions is one to which we are committed to 
honor. A person who takes up a job and contributes to the 
pension fund, wants to prepare for a day when he or she is no 
longer able to work, and no government can ignore the payment of 
pensions to which people are legitimately entitled. 
  [Akhalwaya] I asked specifically about the pensioners not 
being able to get free medical treatment as children would be 
entitled to. 
  [Mandela] Well, we are developing a social program in which 
people who are not able to afford to pay for medical expenses 
will be entitled to do so. We have mentioned the question of 
children specifically because it is part of our policy, but we 
have spoken about the disabled, about the aged being entitled to 
assistance form the government. This includes pensioners as 
well. We have made no discrimination whatsoever against 
pensioners. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, what about parity for pensioners 
and pensions for the civil servants who have been working in 
these homelands and independent states? Will the government 
find money to equal the (?package) that they are looking for? 
  [Mandela] Parity is a principle to which we are committed 
and 
we have to find the resources to put the policy in practice. 
  [Akhalwaya] If I may just come back on the question of 
funding the RDP and the finances that are required. There's 
also the question of taxation -- obviously it will be one of the 
sources of revenue. In your speech, and I just quote, you said 
that we agree that a permanently higher general level of 
taxation is to be avoided. Is that sort of code word 
"permanently" or does that mean that you are considering 
temporary higher taxes, and if so isn't temporary part of the 
government plan still out to continue temporary for a long time. 
[as heard] 
  [Mandela] I'm happy we have moved away from pensions because 
I was beginning to get the impression that you are concerned 
about your own pensions. [laughter] Now our policy is that we 
should have a low taxation system. That is our policy and it is 
absolutely important in order to get investments, both local and 
foreign, and that is why we are committed to the system of a low 
taxation system. We don't know of course about the future. We 
will resist any temptation to fund the government by raising the 
rate of taxation. And that formulation is merely intended for 
the... [changes thought] should it become necessary, because of 
concrete conditions to consider raising taxes. Even when we do 
so, there will be the widest consultation with the people who 
will be expected to pay a higher taxation. We will refrain from 
taking any unilateral action. But as presently advised, I cannot 
imagine a case where it will be necessary for us to raise 
taxation. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, let's go beyond the borders -- 
South Africa going back to the family of nations. Where is your 
focus going to be -- southern Africa in Africa, the UN, and are 
we going back as you stated to the Commonwealth? What is in it 
for us? 
  [Mandela] You can't approach this question from the point of 
view of prioritizing. We are in the southern African region. 
And of course, we have to play our role there. We have 
advantages as far as our economy and financial system is 
concerned, which are not enjoyed by our neighbors, and we will 
play our part as equal partners with organizations like SADC 
[Southern African Development Community]. We are part of the 
continent of Africa and we have now been accepted by the OAU. 
We will play our part in that region and on this continent. 
But at the same time we are going to be part of an 
organization, the Commonwealth, which draws its membership from 
all over the world. We will be part of the Non-Aligned 
Movement, which also has got a similar composition. We will be 
part of the United Nations -- a world body, and it's not 
possible to say we attach more importance to this particular 
organization. Insofar as the question of our membership is 
concerned and our activities, they are all on the same basis. 
  [Akhalwaya] President Mandela, tomorrow is Africa Day and 
the United Nations will be lifting the arms embargo on South 
Africa. Now Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] in 
this country has formed -- as a result of the arms sanctions -- 
according to reports, Armscor is now gearing up to tackle the 
international market to sell South African arms abroad, Given 
our own history, given what is happening in our own country in 
terms of violence, the indiscriminate use of firearms, firearms 
being obtainable freely. Are we gearing ourselves up as a 
nation that perhaps should know better, that we want to export 
weapons of death and destruction abroad? 
  [Mandela] The trade in arms is worldwide and I don't think 
it 
will be fair to say that a particular country should not engage 
in trade in arms. After all arms are not provided for the 
purpose of suppression of a particular population group in a 
country. Arms are for the purpose of defending the sovereignty 
and the integrity of a country. From that angle there is 
nothing wrong in having trade in arms. But we are going to look 
very carefully, in so far as our own country, to be sure that 
our trade in arms does not violate considerations of humanity, 
and does not allow any particular country to use those arms for 
suppressing the legitimate aspirations of any ethnic group in 
that particular country. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, you referred to South Africa's 
contribution to world peace, and [word indistinct] about Rwanda 
and Angola. Are there any specifics that you could give with 
(?effect) to what contributions South Africa is going to be 
playing in those two countries? 
  [Mandela] We are part, or we are going to be part of the 
Organization of African Unity. And we are going to form part of 
the frontline states and our contribution will be determined 
collectively by ourselves as well as the organizations I have 
referred to. We have no unilateral policy in this regard. It 
is sufficient for us to declare that as a matter of principle we 
are interested in peace throughout the world generally, and in 
particular in those areas like Rwanda where there is turmoil and 
conflict. But precisely what we'll do will be determined by the 
organizations that are addressing the question. Organizations 
of which we are now members. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, but we see South Africans as being 
mercenaries in Angola, having switched sides from supporting 
UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] to 
supporting the government of the day there. What is the 
government's viewpoint on this one? 
  [Mandela] Well, I think that the position in Angola has been 
complicated by the fact that the South African Government has 
been involved in trying to perpetuate this conflict. The 
approach of this government is totally different. We want 
peace, not only in our country, but in our neighboring states. 
And Angola is part of our neighboring states. King Hassan of 
Morocco, Houphouet-Boigny, the late president of Cote d'Ivoire, 
and myself were already involved in addressing the problem in 
Angola. Our concern is peace between the government of the MPLA 
[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] and UNITA, and 
we are committed to that, and will resist any development that 
is going to interfere with that initiative on our part. And 
therefore, the question of mercenaries, whether from South 
Africa or from any other country, is not consistent with the 
attainment of peace in Angola, and we will do everything in our 
power to ensure that the need for mercenaries is removed. 
  [Akhalwaya] Mr. President coming back home, when you were 
released from prison, one of the first (?meetings) that you gave 
for editors, you talked about the process that was started by 
Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe in going for a cabinet of unity, and 
also President Nujoma, and you talked about a government of 
national unity in this country. That has now come to fruition, 
but at the same time the government of national unity that you 
now have is more a compromise, because especially for the 
cabinet ministers that come from other parties you had no hand 
in, and because of the bargaining not all the people from your 
own party would have been the best people of your choice. Is 
this something that you had planned. Is this government of 
national unity what you wanted all along? 
  [Mandela] We would have been very happy if this government 
represented only the African National Congress, but we are 
solving problems in South Africa, not in the earth. We have to 
take into account the actual conditions in our country. We 
have, through the multiparty forum, brought together the various 
organizations in this country with totally different 
backgrounds. As you know at one time we had no less then 26 
political parties in this country. We have been able to bring 
them on board and to achieve this breakthrough which we 
celebrated on the 10th on May. That alone shows that we have 
everything to gain by having involved all political parties in 
this process. As against 26 political parties, we only have 
three political parties in the government of national unity, and 
that is why consensus is comparatively easy to reach, and we now 
have had two cabinet meetings, and from all of them we have 
emerged with a united approach, and from the point of view of 
the conditions in our country this is the correct strategy for 
anybody who has embarked very seriously in reconciliation and 
nation building. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, do you [word indistinct] in your 
speech earlier today that vulnerable workers will be safeguarded 
by the government. Does this mean that the immigration policy 
will deal differently with skilled workers from outside South 
Africa? 
  [Mandela] We are interested that there should be no 
emigration of skills from the surrounding countries, just as it 
is tragic for South Africa to lose its citizens who have the 
knowledge, the skills, the expertise, the training. It is also 
tragic for our neighbors to lose people of skill. At the 
present moment we have a higher rate of pay, and people who are 
skilled from our neighboring territories, especially now that we 
have a democratic government, the temptation is going to be to 
come to our country, and whilst we may welcome them, but that 
would create serious economic problems for our neighboring 
states, and we are entrusted in stability in this entire region, 
and therefore the problems which will create economic 
difficulties for our neighboring states are our concern. 
  [Akhalwaya] Mr. President, how does that tie in with your 
emphasis on individual rights. Surely individuals from other 
countries will feel that this is where they can do the best for 
themselves. Can they be prevented from coming here? 
  [Mandela] Well you must understand that our Bill of Rights 
is 
intended for South Africans mainly. It does not mean that it 
should be applied mechanically. People coming from other 
countries, we are entitled to decide the question of immigration 
on the basis of problems which an influx of skilled people from 
other countries will create in those countries. You must 
realize how much the neighboring states are going to rely on 
South Africa. Not because we are going to throw our weight 
around, because we have got a developed economy, but because our 
economy can actually benefit the neighboring states. One of the 
issues we have been making in our appeal to the international 
community is that; to assist in the economic development of 
South Africa is actually to assist people of this region, 
because of the important role we are likely to play if the 
international community helps our economy to grow. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. President, on that note we have to thank you, 
and thank you Mr. Akhalwaya. Thanks for your time and thanks 
for being with us.

<F P=106> [Report by Carmel Rickard] </F>
  [Text] Serious political wrangles between the IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party] and the ANC over cabinet positions has left 
Kwazulu Natal, one of the country's poorest, most violent and 
least developed provinces, effectively ungoverned and unable to 
begin implementing much-needed reconstruction projects. 
  Natal ANC officials put some blame on the hardline approach 
of IFP President and National Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi, who meets with President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town 
today in an effort to sort out the squabbles. ANC provincial 
leader Jacob Zuma will also be in Cape Town today, and it is 
understood he will meet with Mr Mandela on the same issue. 
Provincial premier Dr Frank Mdlalose of the IFP and Mr Zuma, 
with their respective advisers, will have talks on Tuesday about 
the problem. 
  ANC sources say that until the stalemate is sorted out, the 
province will not be delegated its powers under the 
Constitution. Pretoria will continue to hold its powers in 
trust, and Kwazulu Natal will be effectively powerless. 
  ANC sources said the force of Mr Buthelezi's presence at 
regional level could become so significant that the province 
would end up with "two premiers", Mr Buthelezi and Dr Mdlalose. 
  Among grievances listed by Mr Zuma was Dr Mdlalose's 
handling 
of cabinet allocation. Initially he announced Mr Zuma would 
have the post of social welfare, but this was changed -- 
according to Mr Zuma, without warning or consultation -- to 
public works and auxiliary services. Mr Zuma also complained 
that the ANC was not given the deputy cabinet position on 
police, which it wanted. "Completely excluding the ANC from this 
portfolio will never work."

<F P=106> [By Mark Ashurst] </F>
  [Text] The continuing stand-off in Natal between regional 
premier Frank Mdalose and the ANC over the allocation of key 
ministerial portfolios in the provincial legislature followed a 
crucial miscalculation by ANC Natal leader Jacob Zuma, sources 
within the ANC said at the weekend. 
  But the ANC has not discarded the possibility of resorting 
to 
court actions to remedy the situation. The sources said Zuma 
agreed to accept an Inkatha victory in the province at a private 
meeting with ANC President Nelson Mandela during the weekend of 
April 30-May 1. 
  The ANC's decision to accept the poll in Natal was based on 
Zuma's confidence that Mdlalose would "co-operate" in the Natal 
cabinet in the interests of national reconciliation. ANC hopes 
for a settlement were pinned on talks between Mandela and 
Inkatha Freedom Party leader Chief Buthelezi, who were set to 
meet in Cape Town last night. ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus said 
there was little sign of goodwill at provincial level. 
  In a speech to the Natal legislature on Friday, Buthelezi 
appealed to the Premier and the cabinet to resist making deals 
at leadership level. Democracy would be "smashed on the rocks 
of expediency" if deals were done in secret "to appear 
reasonable", he said. 
  Inkatha was awarded 51 percent of the Natal vote in last 
month's election, and currently holds six of the 10 ministerial 
seats in the new cabinet. The ANC has refused to accept the 
three portfolios offered to it and is demanding the police 
portfolio described by ANC Midlands chairman Harry Gwala as "the 
difference between liberation and oppression in Natal". 
  Natal University analyst Mary de Haas said ANC leaders were 
primarily concerned with reducing violence by not provoking 
Inkatha. However, any decision to concede such a substantial 
victory to Inkatha was "short-sighted in the extreme". 
  ANC-aligned lawyers confirmed they had sworn affidavits from 
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) officials claiming that 
Inkatha's final poll was the result of "massive fraud". The ANC 
last week suspended an application to the Special Electoral 
Court from its Natal region to review the election result. 
  Niehaus confirmed that the ANC objections were suspended in 
the interests of finding a political settlement in Natal. The 
possibility of reversing this decision could give the ANC added 
"leverage" in negotiations with Inkatha. 
  Further, if Inkatha remained intransigent, the 
Constitutional 
Court could be asked to declare the Natal cabinet's decisions 
null and void on grounds that the cabinet was not properly 
constituted. Administrators could then be appointed to run the 
province, he said. 
  Zuma had "a good working relationship" with Mdlalose, said 
De 
Haas. The dispute over portfolio allocations reflected 
intervention by hardline factions within Inkatha, at whose 
insistence Prince Zulu Gideon had been granted a seat in the 
cabinet in favour of Mike Tarr. 
  IEC chairman Johann Kriegler confirmed that political 
parties 
had been involved in negotiations with the IEC during the 
elections count. The IEC had hoped to resolve objections lodged 
by parties over the IEC's handling of the elections, he said.

  [Text] Durban May 24 SAPA -- KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank 
Mdlalose and the African National Congress' Natal leader Jacob 
Zuma were both confident the impasse over the allocation of 
ministerial portfolios in the province would be broken at 
Tuesday's bilateral meeting. 
  Speaking shortly before the meeting in Durban, Mr Zuma said: 
"We are always confident. We have disputed issues which we 
will try to resolve. We have no reason to fail, I'm ready for 
anything." 
  Dr Mdlalose said he too hoped the differences would be 
resolved, but "you never can predict what will happen". 
  The premier and Mr Zuma said the dispute had been raised 
during Monday's talks between President Nelson Mandela and Home 
Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi in Cape Town. 
  The conflict over the allocation of portfolios arose last 
week when the three ANC ministers, Mr Zuma, S'bu Ndebele and 
Zweli Mkhize, excused themselves from the swearing-in ceremony 
in Pietermaritzburg. 
  The trio were dissatisfied with the portfolios allocated to 
them, and charged Dr Mdlalose should have consulted with them 
before a decision was taken. 
  Mr Zuma was initially awarded the social welfare portfolio, 
Dr Mkhize the health portfolio and Mr Ndebele the roads and 
traffic control portfolio. 
  But in his speech in Ulundi on Friday, Mr Buthelezi said a 
new portfolio, auxiliary services, had been given to the ANC. 
  The meeting to break the deadlock was mooted by Dr Mdlalose 
last week.

  [Text] Durban May 24 SAPA -- A joint working group, under 
the leadership of KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose and 
African National Congress Natal leader Jacob Zuma, was 
established on Tuesday to resolve differences over executive 
portfolios in the provincial legislature. The group was formed 
when a delegation led by Dr Mdlalose and an ANC delegation met 
in Durban in a bid to break the impasse over the allocation of 
portfolios. 
  The conflict arose last week when Natal's three anc 
ministers, Mr Zuma, S'bu Ndebele and Zweli Mkhize, excused 
themselves from the swearing-in ceremony in Pietermaritzburg. 
  The ANC was dissatisfied with the portfolios allocated to 
the 
three ministers, and charged Dr Mdlalose should have consulted 
with them before a decision was taken. 
  A joint statement issued after Tuesday's meeting said the 
group would meet in Durban on Thursday to finalise matters so 
the KwaZulu/Natal Executive Council could begin to exercise its 
responsibility. 
  Mr Zuma said the re-allocation of portfolios was still under 
discussion. 
  Both delegations committed themselves to working together 
and 
Dr Mdlalose said the provincial government of unity was "on 
track". 
  "Full and frank discussions were held in a cordial 
atmosphere. Both sides committed themselves as a matter of 
urgency to finding solutions to outstanding issues and good 
progress was made in this regard," read the statement.

<F P=106> [Report by Ray Hartley] </F>
  [Text] KwaZulu self-protection unit recruits were allegedly 
given gruesome training in terrorism -- including how to set 
fire to a bus so passengers could not escape -- at a camp under 
the command of Inkatha senator Phillip Powell. Details of the 
training at Mlaba camp, about 40km from Ulundi, and a dramatic 
election day raid by TEC [Transition Executive Council] 
officials, are contained in a confidential report which has been 
handed to President Nelson Mandela. The report, compiled by TEC 
investigator Howard Varney and dated May 19, said information 
had alleged the trainees "were preparing for disruptive action 
over the election period." 
  Demonstrations of the bus-burning technique were carried out 
at a grenade training site on the Umfolozi river bed, a former 
camp trainee told the TEC investigator. He said trainees were 
also taught how to construct homemade bombs. Instruction was 
provided on how to sabotage a vehicle by tampering with the 
battery so that "when the vehicle is started, the battery will 
explode". 
  Training, which took place using illegal weapons allegedly 
supplied by officials in the KwaZulu government and police, also 
covered the use of "AK-47s, Makarovs, Uzis, pump action 
shotguns, limpet mines, pistols (and) R1 rifles", the report 
said. 
  The investigation prompted TEC officials Mac Maharaj and 
Fanie van der Merwe to accompany the Maritzburg SAP's [South 
African Police] Major-General Wynand van der Merwe on an 
unsuccessful raid of the camp, which raised questions about 
police partiality. On arrival near the camp site on April 26, 
the group agreed that General van der Merwe would land his 
helicopter in the camp first and persuade Mr Powell to allow a 
search of the facility, but this plan had to be aborted. 
"Persons in the crowd picked up stones and the helicopter made 
a hasty retreat." The helicopter flew to a nearby 121 
Battalion Base, where TEC, police and SANDF [South African 
National Defence Force] officials decided that "firm action 
would be taken against the camp". 
  The local Internal Stability Division, under a Major Pelser, 
was instructed to set up a roadblock to prevent trainees and 
equipment from leaving the camp, and a mechanised SADF [South 
African Defence Force] back-up made its way to the camp. The 
SADF contingent was scheduled to arrive on the morning of April 
27, in time for a full search. 
  "It was decided and agreed that it was of vital importance 
that all personnel in the camp be properly processed and that 
they be held until this had happened," the report said. But, 
once the TEC officials had left the scene to return to 
Maritzburg, the trainees were allowed through the police 
road-block. Major Pelser claimed he had no orders to prevent 
the trainees from leaving the base and that buses were searched 
at the roadblock. But General van der Merwe said most of the 
buses had departed before the roadblock was set up. 
  "The departure of most of the trainees from the base without 
any processing by the police constitutes a major setback to the 
investigation," Mr Varney said in the report. 
  Police entered the camp with the permission of Mr Powell 
shortly before midnight to find it had been abandoned in haste. 
A rondavel "allegedly under the control of Phillip Powell" was 
searched and G3 rifles, handgrenades, rifle grenades, shotguns 
and ammunition were seized. Mr Powell's vehicle was searched 
and a homemade weapon was seized. "This homemade shotgun is 
apparently the same type that was manufactured by the former C10 
(Vlakplaas) persons named in the Goldstone report," the report 
said. 
  The KwaZulu government intended deploying as many as 1,000 
of 
the trainees in the KwaZulu Police as special or assistant 
constables, but this had not been done. 
  A thousand rifles that Mr Powell tried to purchase from 
Eskom 
could have been destined for the trainees, the report said. 
  Mr Varney called for a thorough inquiry into training at the 
Mlaba camp and the procurement of weapons used in the training. 
  Mr Powell could not be reached for comment.

  [Text] Durban May 23 SAPA -- At least seven people were 
killed in violence in KwaZulu/Natal since the start of the 
weekend, and the Human Rights Committee said this was the lowest 
figure recorded over a weekend this year. The latest killings 
pushed the death-toll in the province to at least 455 since the 
declaration of a state of emergency in KwaZulu/Natal on March 31. 
  In Montclair, Durban, the corpse of an unidentified man was 
found on Saturday. He had been hacked to death, the South 
African Police said. The bullet-riddled body of another 
unidentified man was found in Inanda, north of Durban, on 
Saturday morning. Another body of a man was found in the nearby 
Nhulswane river. He had been shot in the left eye. In Stanger, 
on the north coast, Mr Jabulani Mtembu was shot dead by unknown 
gunmen on Saturday night. In Mtunzini, on the north coast, Mr 
Amos Cebukulu was awoken by a knock on his door on Saturday 
night. He saw that one of the men was armed, and fled. Upon his 
return Mr Cebukulu found the body of his son. 
  The HRC meanwhile said violence had "definitely decreased", 
but spokesman Linda McLean cautioned that there was still 
dissatisfaction over the election results and concern over 
policing in the province. "We are still very worried about the 
violence in KwaZulu/Natal."

  [Text] Johannesburg May 22 SAPA -- Pan Africanist Congress 
[PAC] North West Leader, Dr Ben Marengwa, on Sunday called for a 
PAC national congress to be convened to debate the party's poor 
performance in the elections. Dr Marengwa, the PAC's premier 
candidate for the North West, said the "electoral national 
fiasco" had been caused by the inefficiency of the PAC head 
office. "I therefore call for an immediate national congress of 
the PAC to correct the ills. In the PAC certain heads must 
roll." 
  Dr Marengwa would not elaborate on the nature of the 
inefficiency or the party members he was criticising. "That 
would be undemocratic," he told SAPA. "There is a national 
conference planned for December, but we think this is too long a 
time to wait. It must be brought forward. I have sounded out 
other leaders and I believe I will have support for the call to 
have an immediate congress. We need to make adjustments. This 
has to be thrashed out." 
  Dr Ben Marengwa said he wanted to thank the 27,000 who voted 
PAC in the North West, and the 243,000 voters "out of a 
membership of more than a million who loyally voted PAC 
nationally".

<F P=106> [By Tyrone August] </F>
  [Text] The role of South Africa's defence force, which in 
the past was widely regarded as one of terror and destruction, 
will change fundamentally in the years ahead. Its participation 
in cross-border raids and attacks such as those on a suspected 
APLA [Azanian Peoples Liberation Army] base in Transkei last 
year, are still fresh in the minds of many. 
  But the new Minister of Defence, Mr Joe Modise, is 
determined 
to change the role of the defence force. Among his plans is the 
establishment of a service brigade. "A lot of thinking has gone 
into the creation of a service brigade," said Modise in an 
interview in Pretoria." This brigade will be funded by the 
Government and the community." 
  Initially, the new SA National Defence Force (SANDF) will 
provide vocational training for those who cannot become part of 
the standing force of between 67,000 and 70,000 soldiers. 
  Those who lose their places in the SANDF as a result of 
rationalisation will be given vocational training to prepare 
them for civilian life. "At the same time, they will also play 
a major role in the Reconstruction and Development Programme," 
said Modise. 
  "After dealing with ex-servicemen, the service brigade might 
also bring in young people who are in the streets and train them 
to play a part in the economy." 
  He said similar brigades were successfully established in 
Taiwan and in the United States. In South Africa, they will be 
managed by the SANDF but not be part of it. "It will be more or 
less an auxiliary body with a lot of emphasis on preparing 
people to participate in our economy," said Modise. 
  They will be trained as builders, bricklayers, carpenters, 
electricians, and later, also as motor mechanics, panelbeaters 
and spray painters. Some will also get technical training (for 
example, in electronics) and at a later stage training in 
agriculture. 
  "We would like this service brigade to carry on 
indefinitely, 
like it has in Taiwan," said Modise. "There it has become a 
very important instrument in developing the economy." 
  "That's the route we want to follow. A service brigade in 
South Africa could become an instrument of the people that would 
help to develop our country." 
  The establishment of a service brigade was first hinted at 
in 
a review of 1993 published by the then South African Defence 
Force (SADF) earlier this year. "There are a large number of 
individuals who have received military training of some sort and 
who will not be accommodated in the new defence force," it said 
in its report. 
  "To leave these individuals jobless in the streets is to 
invite trouble." This is where the SADF saw a role for a 
service brigade. 
  "This brigade could be used in non-military tasks, like 
building projects," it said. "After a period of service in the 
brigade, they can leave and make a living in the private sector." 
  The old SADF saw the new defence force playing an increasing 
role in socio-economic development. "The SADF has considerable 
ability in this area," it said. "Although the SADF should be 
designed primarily for conventional operations, pragmatic 
considerations dictate that it may sometimes be used for 
non-military tasks. 
  "The driving principle should be that the return on 
investment in the SADF (now SANDF) should be maximised by 
putting its community utility value to good use without 
impairing its primary role," the report said. 
  The SADF pointed to the role of the military in the United 
States during the Great Depression of the 1930s as an example 
of what it envisaged. "The vast pool of management skills and 
knowledge that is inherently part of any defence force was used, 
rather than military equipment per se, for upliftment projects," 
the SADF said. 
  "Some military personnel with the necessary expertise were 
seconded to other state departments for use in the 
socio-economic environment. "This ensured that military 
equipment, which is needed for war and developed at great cost, 
could be reserved for its original purpose. 
  "Knowledge and expertise that had public application, for 
which the taxpayer had in any case paid, thus became available 
for use to the advantage of the country as a whole." 
  In South Africa, the report said, qualified personnel from 
the SADF could be sued to help teach science and mathematics in 
schools where there was a shortage of qualified teachers. 
Medical orderlies could also be used to teach and promote basic 
hygiene and primary health care. 
  Like Modise, the SADF also saw a role for the new defence 
force in preparing youth who were not adequately trained to 
pursue a career or profession. 
  "A possible partial solution to this problem is to develop 
an 
organisation that can equip these people with the necessary 
skills to enable them to make a decent living," the report said. 
  "It is foreseen that the SADF can be used to train people 
for 
a better future. The organisation has the training facilities, 
the training expertise and the will to help." 
  These ideas are in line with the aims of the new Ministry of 
Defence. "We are in the process of reorganising our army," said 
Modise. 
  "We have always had problems with the defence force playing 
a 
military role inside the country." In the short term the SANDF 
will continue to help maintain stability inside the country. 
  But further down the road, it is clear that there will be a 
major shift in the role of the new defence force. 
  "We are now building a national defence force," he said. 
"The force is now being legitimised. This is the people's own 
force. They must do everything in their power to support it 
because it is their own instrument of protection," Modise said.

  [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- The president of the 
Senate, Mr Kobie Coetsee, announced on tuesday that he was 
resigning with immediate effect as leader of the [Orange] Free 
State National Party [NP]. He said in a statement the 
presidency of the Senate required one not to be involved in the 
cut and thrust of party politics. 
  Mr Wynand Breytenbach, chairman of the Free State NP, would 
automatically take over as party leader in the province until 
the forthcoming provincial congress. 
  Mr Coetsee said he wished to thank the many people who had 
congratulated him on his election as president of the Senate. 
  He was laying down the party leadership with the peace of 
mind and knowledge that it would remain in good and strong hands. 
  National unity and the Free State's interests required of 
nationalists to work together with the government of Premier 
Patrick Lekota.

  [Text] South Africa's membership of the Organization of 
African Unity will be made official with the raising of the 
South African flag at the organization's headquarters in Addis 
Ababa tomorrow. The day, 25 May, had been recognized by the 
United Nations as Africa Day. The flag raising will be attended 
by Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo. Both South Africa's 
national anthems will be played at the ceremony. 
  At the same time Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, the deputy 
foreign affairs minister, Mr. Aziz Pahad, and the foreign 
affairs director general, Mr. Rusty Evans, will be in New York 
where the United Nations Security Council is to lift the last 
remaining sanctions against South Africa. These include the 
arms embargo. South Africa is expected to regain its seat in 
the United Nations General Assembly next month. 
  Earlier OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim said that 
South Africa had been admitted as the 53rd member of the 
organization. The OAU's information and publicity secretary, Mr. 
Ibrahim Gagash, said in Addis Ababa that more than 30 member 
countries had indicated that they were in favor of South 
Africa's membership.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 24 SAPA -- The SA Police Service 
[SAPS] would hunt down "cowards" who continued to murder 
policemen even though the political climate in South Africa had 
changed considerably, the SAPS said on Tuesday. In a statement, 
the SAPS said 93 policemen had been murdered between January 1 
and May 24 this year. 
  "In spite of the fact that unrest incidents have declined 
drastically, ten policemen have been murdered since (election 
day) April 27 -- an indication that the killing of policemen is 
continuing unabated." 
  Young men and women in their prime, who were there to 
protect 
the lives and property of the community, were often killed for 
no reason other than that they were law enforcement officers. 
  "These attacks will no longer be tolerated. The cowards who 
attack our members must not expect any respite in our efforts to 
hunt them down." Regardless of attacks and murders, and long 
hours of work under difficult circumstances, policemen still 
remained dedicated to their task. 
  "It is therefore the responsibility of the community to 
assist the police and become involved in police-related matters 
so as to ensure a future for all South Africans," the SAPS said.

  [Text] Dr. Pallo Jordan, minister of posts, 
telecommunications and broadcasting, says the government should 
not interfere with broadcasting. Speaking at a conference in 
Johannesburg via satellite from Cape Town, he said the 
government will act against broadcasting monopolies by 
restricting possible cross ownership of the media. Karen Kriel 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Karen Kriel] The future of broadcasting 
was discussed today. Dr. Pallo Jordan, the new minister of 
broadcasting, said free air waves should get priority and that 
regulation of the broadcasting is the task of the Independent 
Broadcasting Authority. 
  [Jordan in English] I don't want to be in the position to 
regulate broadcasting, I don't think any government should be in 
a position to regulate broadcasting. That should be the 
function of the independent body. 
  [Kriel] The Independent Broadcast Authority said it will 
probably consider applications for permanent broadcast licenses 
at the end this year -- after certain legal guidelines have been 
completed. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  KwaZulu Land Transfer -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 
25 May publishes on page 16 an editorial examining the transfer 
of land to Zulu King Zwelithini. While noting that President 
Mandela has defused the crisis "for the time being," the 
editorial claims that "disquieting questions remain. The 
transfer has the hallmarks of a furtive pact and political 
chicanery....Suspicions linger that Buthelezi was preparing a 
fall-back position in case the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] lost 
the provincial election in KwaZulu/Natal. By transferring land 
held by the KwaZulu Government to Zwelithini, he seems to have 
been securing an alternative IFP base." 
  Mandela's Speech -- In another editorial on the same page, 
THE STAR describes President Nelson Mandela's speech to 
Parliament on 24 May as "romantic" and "wonderfully unifying." 
"It charted a possible course for the country which would 
constitute a `high road' in anybody's terms. Stripped to its 
essence, the president's message is that the middle classes of 
this country will not only be allowed to continue in their 
productive endeavours, but will be actively encouraged to do so 
by the new Government -- on condition that there is full 
acceptance of the urgent need for the upliftment of the 
poverty-striken and disadvantaged." Noting that the ANC's 
Reconstruction and Development Program has been endorsed by all 
major role-players in South Africa, the editorial concludes: "In 
a programme of sensible, achievable reconstruction and 
development lies the future of all of us; if it fails, so will 
we." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Mandela's Speech -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY also looks at 
President Mandela's speech in its editorial on page 10 of its 25 
May issue. The paper says Mandela presented "an inspired, 
positive, and attainable vision of the future that together we 
can create....His vision of our country's future displays an 
idealism for which we all should strive." The editorial 
continues: "We believe in Mandela's sincerity and in his 
commitment to what he says....We trust the sincerity and 
commitment of the party Mandela leads....While we would have 
preferred specific commitments on issues such as the free flow 
of money and people in and out of the country, we trust the 
commitment to dealing with them sensitively once more pressing 
issues have been addressed." The paper notes that Mandela's 
speech recognized the need to reconcile the concerns of 
investors and bankers with the demand that "economic and social 
inequalities...be rectified quickly." The editorial concludes: 
"The future will not be easy, and attaining the future 
envisioned by Mandela implies commitment from everyone. We 
cannot choose but to remain on the road we have taken. Along it 
we can together create the great society." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Gun Control -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on May 25 
publishes on page 10 an editorial that notes efforts being made 
in the Pretoria, Witwatersrand, and Vereeniging provisional 
parliament to strengthen gun control by revising licensing 
procedures. "In general, we will support any effort to impose 
gun control on a paranoid society which is `armed to the 
teeth.'...While limitations on gun licensing is a step in the 
right direction, a comprehensive plan is needed to make the 
country relatively gun free." The paper urges that such a plan 
take into account the need to improve policing so that citizens 
will not feel the need to own a gun, the need to stop 
individuals in government agencies from dealing illegally in 
guns, and the need to stop the flow of guns from Mozambique and 
other neighboring countries.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 22 May (AFP) -- The Congolese National 
Assembly has adopted an Army territorial reorganization plan 
that will ensure better liaison between the military leaders and 
those of the administrative regions, parliamentary sources 
disclosed today. 
  Indeed, a bill adopted yesterday makes for the creation of 
seven military defense regions that will replace the five 
military zones that have so far existed. The military leaders 
of these seven regions, generals or senior officers, will also 
serve as military advisers to the prefects of the country's nine 
administrative regions. The military authorities will be 
responsible "for the preparation and implementation of 
operational defense" before the Army Headquarters, the same 
sources explained. Every military region will be subdivided 
into districts "corresponding to all or part of an 
administrative region," while special arrangements will be made 
for border areas. 
  According to the British magazine, MILITARY BALANCE, the 
Congolese Army is made up of about 11,000 men. The government 
recently announced its intention to enroll 2,000 young men aged 
between 20 and 24 to rejuvenate the Army. It currently has a 
very high proportion of officers and noncommissioned officers.

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks in Lusaka are still 
suspended, and the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] delegation is in Huambo for consultations, but we 
are seeing signs of optimism in Luanda. Aldomiro da Conceicao, 
the Angolan presidency spokesman, admitted that the negotiations 
may be over by 15 June. De Conceicao spoke to Valter Medeiros 
on the telephone and also admitted that the peace agreement may 
be signed by the Angolan prime minister and the UNITA leader: 
  [Begin recording] [De Conceicao] As far as know, the talks 
are suspended because the UNITA delegation has not yet arrived

will be resolved as soon as possible. 
  [Medeiros] Does that mean by the middle of June? 
  [De Conceicao] It is possible. As far as we are concerned, 
the sooner the better. 
  [Medeiros] Will the agreement be signed in New York? 
  [De Conceicao] No, there is no set place, as far as I am 
aware. 
  [Medeiros] Will the peace document be signed by Prime 
Minister Marcolino Moco and Dr. Savimbi? 
  [De Conceicao] Not even that has been defined yet. 
  [Medeiros] But is there not a possibility it may be so? 
  [De Conceicao] There are several possibilities, including 
this one. [end recording] 
  Peace in Angola may be a reality by the middle of June.

  [Text] The Central Committee of the Popular Movement for 
the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] is expected to end its session 
this evening after five days of deliberations, which dealt with 
the internal organization of the party, the country's 
development strategy, and the Angolan peace talks. MPLA Central 
Committee spokesman Norberto dos Santos said: 
  [Begin Santos recording] We think that our negotiating team 
is doing good work. It is defending the interests of our 
country and the government and we encourage it to continue on 
this path. The government has made an offer. It has already 
expressed its stand on UNITA's participation in the government, 
the special status for Jonas Savimbi, and the mandate of the UN 
Angola Verification Mission. These issues are on the 
negotiating table, waiting for UNITA to adopt a stand. Our 
delegation will therefore continue to deal with these issues. 
The MPLA Central Committee has restated that it is necessary to 
find a just and lasting peace in Lusaka that will defend the 
interests of the Angolan people. [end recording]

  [Text] The Constitutional Court has invalidated the head 
of state's appointment of the former justice minister, Yves 
Yehouessi, as Supreme Court president. The reason given was 
that the term of office of the incumbent president of the 
Supreme Court, Frederick Houndeton, had not yet expired. 
President Nicephore Soglo has accepted the court's decision. 
Theodore Holo, the Beninese Government spokesman, speaks on the 
issue to Herman Gnani: 
  [Begin Holo recording] We live in a state of law, where the 
Constitutional Court has annulled a presidential decision. You 
know that the government and the head of state, who respect the 
rule of law, have accepted this decision. This does not mean 
that this decision, which cannot be appealed, does not deserve 
to be analyzed and commented upon by the citizens of our 
country, who can appreciate its quality. You know that the law 
is a living organism which evolves; it is not an exact science. 
Even the Constitutional Court can make mistakes. 
  It is true that today's errors may be corrected tomorrow. 
This does not mean; however, that this decision will stand for 
all eternity. I regret this particular decision because of the 
reputation -- and our personal attachment for -- the 
Constitutional Court. The Court must prove, through the 
relevance of its decisions, that it is a body which correctly 
interprets the Constitution. This is all the more true since 
the person called into question in this situation is former 
Minister Yehouessi, who we owe a great debt to for his work in 
bringing ethics to our country's public life. Do not forget 
that he was one of the great artisans of the Cisse trial, and if 
it is in this manner that the nation intends to reward him, then 
I think we are going to dissuade a lot of initiative from those 
who want to engage in the fight for improving the moral quality 
of public life. [end recording]

  [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- President Nelson Mandela 
was given a full display of military ceremony and precision on 
arriving at Parliament on Tuesday to address the first historic 
sitting of the all-race National Assembly. The president's 
cavalcade was led by 20 military motorcyclists as it cruised 
past a guard of honour comprising all three combative arms of 
the National Defence Force. 
  Over 100 neatly-ranked infantrymen presented arms to order 
as 
Mr Mandela and his daughter Princess Zenani Dlamini took the 
national salute from the red-carpeted steps of the great hall of 
Parliament. 
  The crash of their boots had scarcely died away when a navy 
band broke into the strains of "Die Stem", followed by "Nkosi 
Sikele Iafrika" [God Bless Africa]. 
  A ramrod stiff, stern-faced Mr Mandela -- the former 
commander of the military wing of the once-outlawed African 
National Congress -- crooked his right arm across his chest as 
he took the national salute. 
  The troops stood unflinchingly, their white ceremonial 
gloves, gaiters, red cravats and epaulettes adding colour to 
camouflage fatigues and the grey cobbles of Stalplein. 
  Six Impala trainers then roared in low from the north, 
trailing plumes of red, white, green, yellow and grey smoke, 
wheeling away towards Kloof Nek. 
  The national anthems over, Mr Mandela and Princess Zenani 
were accompanied into the building past an air force guard of 
honour by army Colonel Tom Marx and navy Captain Steve Stead, 
both officers in ceremonial regalia. 
  First to arrive at Parliament were Second Deputy President 
Mr 
F W de Klerk, followed by First Deputy President Mr Thabo Mbeki. 
  Meanwhile, as security men kept watch from nearby rooftops 
with binoculars and mingled with onlookers, a crowd had gathered 
at the Parliament street gate, singing freedom songs and 
blocking the road. 
  An army captain at the scene appeared unruffled by the 
unexpected obstacle across his troops' line of advance, instead 
ordering them to retreat towards Stalplein whence they had come. 
  And as Mr Mandela stood up inside to make history, a 
sergeant-major abruptly started mustering his troops who marched 
off the scene to time marked by bellows that echoed off the 
offices of power.

<F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Alves Antonio] </F>
  [Text] Good evening! After about a five-day break, the 
Angolan peace talks exercise has resumed here in Lusaka with the 
magic wand of mediator Alioune Blondin Beye in operation. All 
Zambian holidays are strictly observed by Alioune Blondin Beye, 
special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola. 
Today he broke the tradition, however, by receiving in his 
apartment this afternoon the negotiating team from the National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which had 
returned from Huambo today. Although nothing concrete is known 
about the meeting, it is thought that the UNITA men briefed 
Alioune Blondin Beye on the results obtained in their meetings 
with their leadership on negotiations with the government here 
in Lusaka. 
  Sources close to the mediator told Luanda Radio Nacional 
that 
it is hoped that delegations from the government and UNITA will 
meet alone tomorrow. The source added, however, that everything 
will depend on Malian-born Alioune Blondin Beye who will 
certainly try to use an effective tactic to speed up the 
negotiating process. 
  The Angolan peace process mediator is meanwhile working on 
his report to be sent to the meeting of the UN Security Council 
in New York set for 31 May. 
  The government delegation is all set for talks. The issues 
under discussion, within the framework of national 
reconciliation, are the future of the Voice of Resistance of the 
Black Cockerel; special status for Jonas Savimbi; his security 
and the security of senior UNITA officials; and UNITA's 
participation in the government.

  [Excerpt] President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
this evening received Brazil's Ambassador to Portugal Jose 
Aparecido de Oliveira. Prime Minister Marcolino Moco was 
present at the audience. The Brazilian diplomat is in Angola at 
the head of a Brazilian delegation to discuss with the Angolan 
finance authorities the rescheduling of Angola's debt to Brazil. 
The audience granted by the president of the Republic to the 
Brazilian delegation is a sign of the importance the Angolan 
authorities are placing on the issue. Finance Minister Alvaro 
Craveiro; Jose Leitao, director of the President of the 
Republic's Office; and Council of Ministers Secretary Carlos 
Feijo also attended the talks between Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
and Aparecido de Oliveira. 
  [Begin Oliveira recording] President Itamar Franco has 
conveyed to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos special greetings, 
which I forwarded. President Dos Santos visited Brazil 
recently, and it is in view of his talks with President Itamar 
Franco that I have come from Lisbon to Luanda with a high-level 
delegation from Brazil for talks on Angola's debt to Brazil. 
Obviously, President Itamar Franco urged us to accommodate the 
Angolan and Brazilian interests, and that is what I am doing. I 
have come to report on the first meeting underway between the 
National Bank of Angola with representatives of the Angolan and 
Brazilian Governments. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Talks between Angola and Brazil on bilateral 
relations ended yesterday. The Brazilian delegation, headed by 
Ambassador Jose Aparecido, left Angolan yesterday. Earlier, 
Angolan Finance Minister Alvaro Craveiro, who took part in the 
talks, said negotiations with Brazil are on right track. He 
said a degree of understanding has been reached and further 
meetings have been scheduled to smooth the edges. 
  [Begin Craveiro recording] The negotiations go beyond mere 
financial relations. The negotiations are linked to petroleum 
issues and a number of financial facilities, in addition to the 
problem of Angola's debt. There is a degree of understanding 
and we are on the right track to settle that issue. [end 
recording] 
  The Angolan minister noted that bilateral trade exchanges 
have not yet been formalized, though they are being considered 
as part of wide-ranging cooperation. 
  [Begin recording] [Craveiro] Such relations have not yet 
been 
formalized. They are being considered as part of wide-ranging 
cooperation. We will hold further meetings in the near future 
to formalize such relations. 
  [Reporter] Has agreement been reached on the rescheduling of 
the debt? 
  [Craveiro] Well, that is a [words indistinct] element. [end 
recording] 
  Jose Aparecido de Oliveira says his country has opened a 
credit facility to pay for the supply of medicines and 
foodstuffs. 
  [Begin Oliveira recording] It has already been agreed. We 
took the initiative of informing Minister Craveiro and the 
Angolan delegation that President Itamar Franco has recommended 
the Bank of Brazil to open a credit facility for the supply of 
foodstuffs and medicines to Angola. Actually, that is the first 
time for Brazil to take such an initiative. There were no 
recent impediments on the part of Brazil regarding the supply of 
perishables. It is the first time that that has happened. It 
is something new. [end recording] 
  Trade exchanges between the two countries amount to some 
$200 
million.

  [Text] President Chiluba has said that southern Africa 
appears to be heading for greater regional development now that 
South Africa which stood as a major obstacle to peace is 
democratically free. Speaking at the second military investiture 
ceremony at which he awarded more than 200 senior members of the 
Zambia Army and Air Force with medals, Mr. Chiluba said there 
was now need for Africa to strive to bring lasting peace to 
Angola and Mozambique. President Chiluba paid tribute to 
members of the Armed Forces who have participated in United 
Nations peacekeeping operations in Mozambique. He said because 
of the good record the soldiers have, Zambia has now been asked 
by the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity to 
contribute troops to Rwanda and Angola.

  [Text] Harare May 24 SAPA -- Zimbabwe has welcomed South 
Africa's admission into the Organisation of African Unity, the 
ZIANA news agency reported. In a statement on Tuesday, the 
Foreign Affairs Ministry said Zimbabwe welcomed the admission of 
Pretoria into the OAU "as the true fulfilment of the objectives 
of the founding fathers of the organisation". 
  The OAU commemorates its 30th anniversary on Wednesday, a 
public holiday in Zimbabwe. 
  The statement said with the exception of Western Sahara 
where 
people still had to exercise their inalienable right to national 
self-determination, the African continent could now be said to 
have finally rid itself of colonialism and and foreign minority 
domination.

  [Excerpts] Bujumbura, 25 May (KNA/PANA) -- The half-caste 
Belgian-Burundian businessman Mathias Hitimana, chairman of the 
small monarchist People's Reconciliation Party (PRP), has urged 
workers in Burundi to go on strike on Wednesday [25 May]. 
  The PRP leader's demands include the opening of the public 
media to the opposition and the cancellation of plans to hold a 
conference on the theme "Restauration and Maintenance of Public 
Order in the State of Law", scheduled for early June in Nairobi. 
  The initiator of the conference is the UN secretary 
general's 
special representative in Burundi, Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of 
Mauritania. All political organizations in Burundi and the army 
command have been invited to the conference. But the 
opposition, fronted by PRP sees the conference as a repeat of 
the Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) summit meeting. [passage omitted] 
  Newspapers close to the opposition has branded the proposed 
meeting as a "summit of betrayal" for seeking to discuss the 
delicate issue of the Burundi Army outside the national 
territory. The threat of a general strike looms over the 
Burundian capital at a time when interim President Sylvestre 
Ntibantunganya has been touring the country for a week, asking 
his fellow displaced countrymen to return to their homes now 
that calm is gradually returning.

  [Excerpt] Bujumbura, 25 May (KNA/PANA) -- The strike action 
called for Wednesday [25 May] by Mathias Hitimana, leader of a 
minor Burundi pro-monarchist opposition party, People's 
Reconciliation Party (PRP), did not take effect. The PANA 
correspondent in Bujumbura noted that in Bujumbura the capital, 
offices, banks and transport were functioning normally. 
  The PRP leader had called the strike to protest against the 
closure of public media organs to the opposition and the 
proposed holding of a conference on Burundi, scheduled to take 
place in Nairobi, Kenya. Contacted by PANA by telephone 
Wednesday [25 May], the PRP leader denied that the strike had 
failed. He claimed that in the long run, the citizens will join 
his movement's cause because it was just. Asked to comment on 
the proposed Nairobi conference on the theme "Restoration and 
Maintenance of Public Order in a State of Law", Hitimana, who is 
a half-caste said the meeting was under intense discussions 
between the UN special representative in Burundi and the 
country's politicians. 
  The negotiations are being conducted to determine the 
justification of such meeting, as well as the choice of venue.

  [Text] The guest of Afrique Soir is Alexis Kanyarengwe, the 
president of the Rwandan Patriotic Front. Our special envoy, 
Monique Mas, has met him and asked him to explain the position 
of his movement toward the UN decision to deploy 5,500 blue 
helmets for a humanitarian mission in Rwanda: 
  [Begin recording] [Kanyarengwe] We in fact agree that a 
humanitarian force should come and help and facilitate the 
activities of the humanitarian organizations operating in our 
country, and also to help people in dangerous situations, 
especially those confronted by a crazy militia and its 
massacres. But what we don't understand is why their number is 
quite high in proportion to the task assigned to them. We find 
the figure of 5,000 is [word indistinct]. We thought a force of 
about 2,000 men would be enough. 
  [Mas] You seem to be worried in case this humanitarian force 
becomes a buffer force? 
  [Kanyarengwe] It has often been noticed that for one reason 
or another, there is always an authority which tries to deflect 
such a force from its task [words indistinct]. We are not 
afraid of this and we are not excessively worried about it. If 
this ever happens, we will take appropriate measures. Once 
again, we insist that this force should not exceed 2,000. 
  [Mas] Tell us what will specifically happen -- are you ready 
to hand over the airport which is under your control to the 
United Nations? 
  [Kanyarengwe] Yes, we discussed with the United Nations this 
issue of turning the airport into a neutral zone. We replied 
that since we fought many battles to conquer this airport, we 
intend to keep it under our control and in security and put it 
at the disposal of the United Nations for any activity it wishes 
to undertake. 
  [Mas] The international community is urging you to end the 
war and agree to a cease-fire. What would make you end the war 
and what are your conditions? 
  [Kanyarengwe] We would have hoped that the international 
community would help us to end the war from day one when the 
massacres started, when people were being mutilated, maltreated, 
and tortured, to put an end to the work of the assassins in the 
authorities. There was an urgent need to put an end to 
massacres, but instead, the international community came quickly 
to the help of their nationals and turned its back on us. 
Finally, it was only after thousands of people had been killed 
that the international community expressed its indignation. We 
are shocked and we were shocked by this attitude. The 
international community has abandoned us. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Finnish News Service report based on Stockholm TIDNINGARNAS </F>
TELEGRAMBURO dispatch: "Rwanda Is a Catastrophe Also for AIDS 
Research"] 
  [Text] The war in Rwanda has destroyed a large-scale 
medical project for testing the AIDS vaccine. Laboratories, 
research personnel -- everything that was in place, says 
Professor Lars Olaf Kallings to TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBURO. 
  Now the Belgian, French, and U.S. physicians, as well as 
other experts who were responsible for the project, have 
departed the area. Rwandans who were involved find themselves in 
flight either inside or outside the country. 
  Rwanda has been hard hit by AIDS. A study conducted two 
years 
ago found that 45 percent of pregnant women in the country were 
infected with HIV. 
<H5>  Rwanda at the AIDS Catastrophe's Epicenter </H5>
  "Rwanda, Burundi, and the Kagera area in Tanzania, and a 
part 
of Zaire comprise the epicenter of the African AIDS 
catastrophe," says Prof. Kallings, who is part of the 
international effort, but is on the the staff of the Swedish 
Public Health Institute in Stockholm. 
  The UN World Health Organization (WHO) had selected Brazil, 
Uganda, Thailand, and Rwanda for the vaccine project. The 
research station and laboratory located in Kigali, the capital, 
had already produced good results before the appearance of any 
vaccine that could be tested on a large scale. 
  "What we know about how the infection is spread from mother 
to child, and especially about the role of breast milk, has 
often come from studies in Rwanda, just as understanding of how 
a noninfected partner in a marriage can be protected," says 
Kallings. 
  He emphasizes that WHO's Rwanda project was not tainted by 
colonialism. It did not operate by having foreign exports come 
to an underveloped country in order to demonstrate how things 
were to be done. The Rwandan authorities and Rwandan staff 
personnel played a large role, he stated. 
  "It is tragic that this is now all destroyed. Moreover, 
Rwanda is a country that in general has great need of the 
results from the vaccine project," he says. 
<H5>  Enormous Streams of Refugees </H5>
  "We don't know how the institutions that were responsible 
for 
the project have been impacted by the war. But we can fear the 
worst." 
  In Kinshasa, located in neighboring Zaire, is found a good 
AIDS laboratory with significance for the entire region. Riots a 
couple of years ago led to plundering of the building. The 
refrigerator was lifted out and all tests destroyed, states 
Kallings, and he now fears the same sort of thing is now 
happening in Kigali. 
  Enormous waves of refugees have fled from Rwanda over the 
past month, especially into Tanzania. 
  "We know that war and fleeing of people leads to spreading 
the infection," asserts Prof. Kallings.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 25 May (AFP) -- A group of personalities 
from the Union of Independent Democrats [UDI] has formed a 
"radical wing" faithful to the Sacred Union of the Radical 
Opposition [USOR], Frederic Kibassa Maliba, president of the 
opposition group, announced yesterday evening. The UDI is one 
of the member parties of the Union for the Republic and 
Democracy [URD], which broke away from the USOR leadership, 
accusing it of being driven by Tshisekedi's party, the Union for 
Democracy and Social Progress [UPDS]. 
  The URD considers that the USOR, to which it still belongs, 
will be henceforth divided into two camps, a moderate one, which 
it represents, and a radical one, driven by the UDPS and its 
followers. Kibassa Maliba also announced that the USOR and its 
allies supported the call for a ghost city demonstration on 27 
May. This event is aimed at the "defense of the Transitional 
Constitution," according to Lambert Mende, information minister 
for the Tshisekedi government. 
  An initial call to turn Kinshasa into a ghost city was made 
yesterday morning by the Innovating Forces of the Sacred Union, 
one of the hardline groups in the USOR "to confirm their 
confidence in the prime minister-elect". Until this morning, 
the URD had not made its position known concerning the call for 
a ghost city operation, or concerning the defection from the UDI.

  [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today 
said that he did not support the idea of the Organization of 
African Unity, OAU, establishing a military wing to solve the 
problems of the continent. The president pointed out that the 
establishment of a military wing will only serve to suppress the 
people, adding that he believed in dialogue to solve Africa's 
problems. The president said, that for a country like Kenya to 
have survived for 30 years without being distracted by coups, 
was a clear indication of the existence of democratic practices 
since independence. The president observed that it was 
unfortunate that countries like Kenya, who have all along been 
practicing democracy, are lumped with other countries which have 
just started observing democratic principles. 
  President Moi was speaking at parliament when he officially 
opened the 25th conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary 
Association, Africa region. President Moi noted that 
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, having stemmed from the 
roots of a long established parliamentary process, should have 
formed committees to look into the best ways of introducing 
multiparty democracy in the African continent. President Moi 
said such committees would have looked into the final details of 
how African societies were going to implement multipartyism. He 
said that it was unfortunate that the continent now has to deal 
with the devastating effects of pluralism in some countries. 
President Moi said Africa should endeavor to have home grown 
parliamentary democracy, rather than copy blindly and without 
judgement other people's systems of governance. The president 
said that he had consistently spoken against any attempt to 
impose systems of government that militate against the wishes 
and value systems of the African people. 
  President Moi noted that anyone or group of people imposing 
their will on others was oppressive, and also denied others the 
freedom to manage their own affairs. The head of state told 
African leaders to strongly reject moves by the developed 
countries to experiment with their peoples. The president said 
that Kenyans were now struggling with the effects of political 
reforms that have led to a state of tribal loyalities and 
inter-tribal animosities. He noted that the reforms have 
widened ethnic divisions, and now threatens the cherished goals 
of national unity. He said that pluralism has adversely 
affected institutions such as the judiciary, public service 
commission, and the civil service, which should be rendering 
quality service without paying attention to political 
affiliations or being partisan. President Moi said that, in 
spite of Africa's economic potential, the continent still lags 
behind in development, and this has been made worse by the large 
concentration of refugees. President Moi told the Commonwealth 
Parliamentary Association conference that leaders must seriously 
start thinking how to avoid the eminent disintegration of the 
continent. He said good politics always results in prosperity 
and enjoyment of life, adding that by all means politics of 
bloodshed and unnecessary suffering must be avoided. He told 
the conference to explore to what extent parliamentary democracy 
as practiced in African countries may have contributed to the 
problems that confront the continent. The president said the 
most crucial task is to educate the people to appreciate the 
importance of the continent's age old cultural values and 
democratic practices. 
  He told the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to also 
promote understanding and respect among the nations of the 
world, and especially among its membership. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Addis Ababa May 25 SAPA -- South Africa has to 
consider humanitarian aid to refugees displaced by civil war in 
Rwanda, Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo said on Wednesday. 
  In an interview en route to Addis Ababa, he said possible 
military intervention in Rwanda by the South African troops 
would have to be carefully considered by the government. "There 
is no plan so far of any military action. But the spirit to 
assist and desire to help is there." 
  Mr Nzo and senior officials of his department arrived in 
Addis Ababa on Wednesday afternoon to officially raise South 
Africa's flag outside the Organisation of African Unity 
headquarters. 
  South Africa became the 53rd member of the OAU on Monday. 
  Mr Nzo said South Africa would play a role in conflict 
mediation efforts in Africa in consultation with the OAU and the 
United Nations. 
  He warned against exaggerated expectations of economic 
benefits arising from South Africa's admission to the OAU. 
"Charity begins at home. South Africa also has large foreign 
debt and must do everything possible to end that debt." 
  The foreign minister said South Africa's membership of the 
OAU was "the culmination of a dream that one day South Africa 
will take its rightful place alongside the independent states of 
Africa". 
  South Africa would assist the continent in asserting itself 
in international politics and there was an increased potential 
for trade links with other African states. 
  He emphasised however that South Africa's foreign policy 
would be guided by the priority of improving the lives of South 
Africans. "We are not going to foster big brother relations with 
the rest of Africa. We are for mutual co-operation to help 
uplift the other countries of Africa." 
  The flag-raising ceremony, which would be attended by the 
OAU 
Secretary-General Dr Salim Ahmed Salim, is scheduled to take 
place at 3PM SA [South African] time.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo says 
expectations from countries throughout Africa about South 
Africa's involvement in the continent's economy will have to be 
addressed urgently. 
  Speaking on his arrival at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia today, 
Mr. 
Nzo said the result is that the rest of Africa was looking to 
South Africa to help the continent out of hunger and poverty. 
He told our political staff that the raising of the South 
African flag at the OAU headquarters in the city today was seen 
by many countries in Africa as a symbolic gesture that South 
Africa would satisfy the needs of especially Sub-Saharan 
countries. However, he warned against exaggerated expectations. 
Mr. Nzo will meet the OAU secretary general, Dr. Salim Ahmed 
Salim, today to discuss the role South Africa will play in 
improving conditions for underprivileged societies throughout 
Africa. 
  He also said that no plans had been drawn up yet on South 
Africa's involvement in a possible UN peace force for Rwanda.

  [Text] Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha has 
told the Southern African Development Community, SADC, 
conference in Maseru that southern African countries must 
develop a common petroleum policy. He said that increased 
economic development in the region would enhance the role of 
petroleum in the economies of the region. 
  An important debate was taking place in South Africa on the 
appropriate level of government involvement in the petroleum 
industry. 
  Regarding cooperation between South Africa and SADC 
countries, Mr. Botha said that South Africa had much to learn 
from these countries, particularly in respect to small-scale 
mining. He said small-scale mining was underdeveloped in South 
Africa.

  [Text] Harare May 24 SAPA -- More than 7,000,000 people in 
the Southern Africa Development Community region are in need of 
food aid, World Food Programme regional information officer 
Mercedes Sayagues said on Tuesday. 
  Ms Sayagues said about 3,000,000 Malawians, 2,500,000 
Angolans, 1,500,000 Mozambicans, 150,000 Swazi and 150,000 
Tanzanians would require aid this year, the ZIANA news agency 
reported. 
  "While we are not having problems transporting food aid to 
Tanzania, Malawi and Swaziland, Angola and Mozambique are our 
problem countries," she said, adding that poor roads in the two 
countries hampered the delivery of food aid. 
  "Crop failure added to Angola's problems and we have been 
delivering about 16,000 tons of food to 1,600,000 people in need. 
  "Tanzania has its problems and they are being fueled by the 
spill over of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi. Tanzania now has 
more than 400,000 refugees." She said.

  [Text] Monrovia, 25 mai (AFP) -- Four members of two 
Liberian armed factions were killed and 12 civilians injured 
when the lorry they were riding on ran over a mine north of the 
port town of Buchanan, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday [25 
May]. 
  Those killed were a colonel of the Armed Forces of Liberia 
(AFL) and three guerrillas in a recently emerged faction, the 
Liberian Peace Council (LPC), ministry spokesman Arthur Dennis 
said. 
  The presence of an AFL general staff officer in the company 
of LPC fighters has stirred up new suspicions that the AFL 
helped form the new armed movement last September in a bid 
indirectly to pursue a conflict with Liberia's main armed 
faction, the National Patriotic Front (NPFL). 
  But Dennis said "it is not the AFL that sent (the colonel) 
to 
the territory. He went to the LPC-controlled area on his own." 
  The LPC, which currently controls the region on Liberia's 
central coastline where the truck hit the mine, has declared 
that the NPFL is its avowed enemy. It is not a party to a peace 
pact signed in July last year among the NPFL, the AFL and a 
third faction, the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO). 
  Dennis said that 10 of the civilians travelling with the 
fighters when the mine blast occurred Sunday had been taken to 
hospital in serious condition.

  [Text] As havoc and indiscriminate slaughter of civilians 
continue in the southeast of Liberia, indisputable evidence has 
emerged that the motives behind the LPC [Liberia Peace Council] 
mayhem is to depopulate and (?hurt) the entire southeast of the 
country. LPC fighters are frustrated over failure to gain any 
substantial support and ground from the Bassa, Kru, Grebo, and 
even some Krahn citizens in the south and southeast of the 
country and their unprovoked battle against the NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia]. [sentence as heard] Eyewitnesses 
say the LPC has unleashed a reign of mayhem on these citizens, 
because LPC is of the notion that these citizens [are] original 
supporters of the NPFL. 
  Political analysts are also of the conviction that the 
current wave of violence to depopulate the southeast is intended 
to deplete the area of potential voters, who are all likely to 
vote for the NPFL in the ensuing general and presidential 
elections in Liberia this year.

  [Excerpts] Lagos, 25 May (AFP) -- Politicians in 
southeastern Nigeria have formed a new party in defiance of a 
government ban and called on the junta of General Sani Abacha to 
stand down, press reports said here Wednesday [25 May]. The 
People's Mandate Party was formed in the city of Enugu last week 
as an offshoot of the Eastern Mandate Union (EMU) grouping 
prominent politicians from seven states in the region, the 
reports said. 
  In a statement, the group demanded that Abacha relinquish 
power by June 30 to make way for a sovereign national conference 
on Nigeria's political future, and said it was "agreeable" to 
the possible validation of the outcome of a presidential 
election annulled by a previous military regime last June. That 
poll, said by international observers to be free and fair, was 
generally held to have been won by millionaire businessman 
Moshood Abiola, but then junta chief General Ibrahim Babangida 
alleged there had been irregularities. 
  The EMU said it could embark on the organisation of a 
sovereign national conference and the establishment of a 
government of national unity with like-minded political 
organisations elsewhere in the country. 
  It was not clear whether the new group was affiliated to the 
recently-formed National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a 
pro-democracy movement comprising prominent politicians, retired 
military officers and ex-political office holders from states in 
the southwest, southeast and middle belt of the country. NADECO 
masterminded a boycott Monday in much of Nigeria of the first 
round of elections to a constitutional conference which the 
regime plans to organise at the end of June, as part of a plan 
it has presented to restore civilian rule. [passage omitted] 
  The EMU, led by former presidential candidate Patrick Dele 
Cole, also revived old charges that the east of the country has 
been marginalised within the military and proposed the 
establishment of regional commands to decentralise the Armed 
Forces. In 1967-70, Nigeria was wracked by a civil war that 
ended the secessionist aspirations of the mainly Ibo-peopled 
east, which tried to form the separate state of Biafra.

  [Excerpt] In Togo, the prime minister appointed by 
President Eyadema a month ago, Edem Kodjo, has finally formed 
his government, which was announced yesterday. There are 18 
ministers and one secretary of state. Mr. Kodjo himself 
presents the ministerial team and its program: 
  [Begin Kodjo recording] I assure the Togolese people as a 
whole of my desire to place the government's action in the 
framework of the joint program of the parliamentary majority, 
but in a spirit of openness, with its hand outstretched to all. 
For we must avoid any sectarianism, as we put ourselves 
resolutely at the service of the Togolese people as a whole. 
  I appeal to the union of all democratic forces, and to all 
people of goodwill, so that we may consolidate our efforts to 
respond to the profound desire for change expressed by all the 
people of Togo. 
  This government is perhaps not the government we should have 
liked to have formed, but the expectations and the sufferings of 
the people forced its composition on us. It must get down to 
work, while at the same time trying to preserve the future. 
[end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Senate May 25 SAPA -- The first sitting of the 
Senate on Wednesday was marked by parties united in their praise 
for the president's opening address to Parliament, but also 
sober reminders of the task at hand. 
  First on the speaker's list was Senator Arulsivanathan 
Naidoo 
(NP [National Party]), who praised President Mr Nelson Mandela 
as a remarkable man while saying his predecessor, Mr F W de 
Klerk, deserved the nation's gratitude for his vision and 
courage. 
  The NP was committed to the government of national unity and 
would co-operate with all parties. 
  The first ANC speaker, Mr Simon Makana, said he had been 
given "a great opportunity to break the ice on our side". 
  Mr Mandela had outlined the enormous task of social 
emancipation, one which could only be brought about by economic 
growth based in a politically stable society. 
  A first priority was a national campaign, harnessing both 
the 
armed security forces and the public, to stop the bloodshed. 
  [Orange] Free-Stater Mrs Isabella Direko (ANC) smilingly 
remarked that she and the president of the Senate, Mr Kobie 
Coetsee, shared the same provincial roots. 
  She said children deserved the right to nutrition for full 
physical and mental development. Youth development had to be 
made a national priority. "An empty stomach results in an empty 
and unreasonable mind." 
  The 2.5 million marginalised African children had to be 
reincorporated into society. "We dare not give them up as the 
lost generation. I am sure they have ambitions and desires." 
  Mr Stephanus Grove (ANC) said the courts were prohibitively 
expensive and out of reach to people who most needed them to 
exercise their new rights. 
  The government of national unity should appoint a commission 
of inquiry to investigate rights' matters being heard by 
magistrates, lawyers' rights of appearance in supreme courts, a 
review of the legal aid mean's test and setting up a legal fund 
similar to medical aid. 
  Mrs R Rabinowitz (IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]) appealed for 
openness in the government of national unity, with "no more 
deals, unilateral decisions and domination from the centre". 
  Devolution of powers should be encouraged, with people being 
empowered to understand the costs of population growth, as well 
as take pride in education and work in a culture of equal 
opportunity. 
  Dr Siyabonga Cwele (ANC) said nutritional education and 
breastfeeding were necessary. 
  Mr Mohamed Surty (ANC) said Parliament should be stripped of 
symbols of oppression. 
  Mr David Malatsi (NP) said people should be encouraged to 
pay 
for services like electrification and be discouraged from 
persisting with a boycott culture. Water conservation also had 
to be encouraged. 
  Mr Holoma Lebona (ANC) said the dual exchange system was 
creating great economic harm and as long as it existed there 
would not be economic recovery. 
  He also called for an inquiry into the origins of the 
reserve 
bank. 
  Mrs Yolanda Botha (ANC) said the state should contract work 
to small businesses, encourage co-operatives and the use of 
modern technology to stimulate job-creation. 
  Maj-Gen Tienie Groenewald (Freedom Front [FF]) said the past 
few days had been a "fantastic experience". "What impressed 
most was the spirit of how senators and parliamentarians 
approached their jobs." 
  The FF had listened to Mr Mandela's speech with great 
expectation. His party would not play a negative role or embark 
on political boycotts. "We will make a very positive 
contribution to the new South Africa in which the different 
nations can live in peace..." 
  The government did, however, have to ask if the RDP 
[Reconstruction and Development Program] did not create 
unreasonable expectations.

  [Text] National Assembly May 25 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist 
Congress [PAC] supported Mr Nelson Mandela as president of South 
Africa, PAC leader Mr Clarence Makwetu said in debate on the 
president's speech. "It is an important milestone in our march 
to liberation to have an indigenous African as president after 
centuries of racist, colonial rule," Mr Makwetu said. 
  The events of the past few weeks had been breathtaking. The 
huge voter turnout at elections had demonstrated "a deep hunger 
for democracy among our people". 
  The PAC welcomed Mr Mandela's wide-ranging and balanced 
state 
of the nation address. 
  It also supported Mr Mandela's intention to subscribe to the 
United Nations' Declaration on Human Rights, and asked that 
detention without trial not be used again. People who had 
committed offences in the struggle against apartheid should be 
released unconditionally. Other offenders should be released at 
the discretion of the government of the day. 
  The PAC welcomed Mr Mandela's emphasis on development and 
empowerment. Housing and job creation were important in a 
society where 8-million people lived in shacks. However, the 
government had to resist the temptation to borrow money and had 
to keep inflation in check.

  [Text] National Assembly May 25 SAPA -- Although the 
Democratic Party [DP] was small in numbers at present, it stood 
for values which were great, universal and eternal, DP acting 
leader Mr Tony Leon said on Wednesday. 
  Speaking during debate on the president's address, Mr Leon, 
elected as Dr. Zach de Beer's replacement last Sunday, said he 
and his colleagues would "use all our resources to advance our 
ideals and to unpack our value system so that it touches the 
lives of all South Africans in all communities". 
  The DP supported the government's Reconstruction and 
Development Programme [RDP], he said to applause from ANC 
benches, provided it was sustainable, cost-effective and wide in 
its reach. 
  The following "base-line" characteristics were needed for a 
truly effective RDP: 
  -- a profound change in direction of previous government 
expenditure, with more stability in fiscal and monetary policy; 
  -- recognition of the innovating stimulus of the free market 
economy, without its indifference to unemployment; 
  -- sustainable job creation on a long-term basis; 
  -- acceptance of the broad line of division between public 
and private sectors; and 
  -- the use of market forces to help achieve policy 
objectives. 
  Mr Leon said although the DP was a small party, it 
represented many of the critical interests of South Africa's 
civil society: the professions, elements of the university 
community, smaller and larger businesses, entrepreneurs, 
investors and consumers. 
  He called on the government to lift the state of emergency 
in 
Natal, to ensure that the selection process for judges of the 
constitutional court was open and to promote federalism. 
  Mr Leon paid tribute to Dr. de Beer as someone who had 
represented decency in public life "even when flagrant 
incivility and rhetorical excesses seemed the quickest route to 
political power".

  [Text] Ventersdorp May 25 SAPA -- Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] leader 
Eugene Terreblanche on Wednesday said his organisation would not 
even consider meeting President Nelson Mandela until he gave 
amnesty to all rightwingers in jail or awaiting trial. In a 
statement, Mr Terreblanche reacted to Mr Mandela's remarks on a 
joint Agenda/Newsline TV programme on Tuesday night that he 
would meet Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg. 
The talks would be a follow-up to last Friday's meeting with 
the CP leader and one with Freedom Front leader Gen Constand 
Viljoen. Mr Mandela said he wanted to meet rightwing leaders in 
a bid to address fears of rightwingers, who have strongly 
advocated setting up an independent Afrikaner homeland. 
  It has been confirmed Mr Mandela will meet Dr Hartzenberg at 
his official residence Westbrooke about midday on Wednesday and 
Gen Viljoen later in the day. 
  Mr Terreblanche's statement said the AWB wished to place on 
record that it had not had any discussions whatsoever with the 
African National Congress. "Further we have not given any 
person, persons or body outside the AWB authority or mandate to 
have discussions with any other person, party or body for and on 
behalf of our organisation." 
  Mr Terreblanche said the AWB was not prepared to even 
consider holding talks with the ruling African National Congress 
unless "at the very least" the pre-condition of amnesty to all 
rightwing political prisoners was met. This was the only 
condition under which we would consider having talks, Mr 
Terreblanche said. 
  Mr Mandela had said he wanted to start afresh, the AWB 
leader 
said, adding that therefore the slate had to be wiped completely 
before any other options could be explored. "We wish to point 
out that no government can oppress or banish the ideal of 
freedom which burns in the hearts of our people. Unless the 
above questions are addressed, our people will continue with 
their struggle until they are free."

  [Text] Cape Town May 25 SAPA -- President Mr Nelson Mandela 
held his first meeting with the nine provincial premiers on 
Wednesday. He is also due to meet Conservative Party [CP] 
leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg at midday and Freedom Front leader 
Gen Constand Viljoen later in the day. 
  Emerging from his official Tuynhuys offices flanked by the 
nine premiers and second deputy president Mr F W de Klerk, Mr 
Mandela said there was a need for him and the provincial leaders 
to exchange views. "We will listen to people ourselves; our 
style is one of intensive consultation. The agenda is going to 
come from such meetings," Mr Mandela said. 
  An earlier statement from the Tuyhhuys said the meeting with 
the premiers would include matters such as the relationship 
between the central government and the provincial 
administrations, and relevant constitutional matters. Also of 
importance were the implementation of programmes for 
reconstruction and development. 
  Mr Mandela, who is to meet Dr Hartzenberg about midday at 
his 
official residence Westbrooke, said he was due to meet Gen 
Viljoen later on Wednesday. This followed their meeting on 
Friday and another between Mr de Klerk and the Freedom Front 
leader. Mr Mandela said he was prepared to listen to Gen 
Viljoen in what he called a preliminary discussion. 
  The Conservative Party had also indicated it wanted to raise 
certain issues with the government, including the question of 
amnesty of 32 Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance 
Movement] members implicated in pre-election bomb blasts. Other 
CP concerns included a licence for Radio Pretoria and the 
question of the "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland].

  [Text] Johannesburg May 23 SAPA -- All parties in the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] provincial legislature 
responded positively to Premier Tokyo Sexwale's opening address 
on Monday, but a few members suggested his housing target was 
not realisable. Mr Sexwale last week said 150,000 low-cost 
houses would be built in the next 12 months. 
  National Party caucus leader and MEC [member Executice 
Committee] for public transport Olaus van Zyl said the plan 
meant building 600 houses every working day. 
  His Democratic Party counterpart Ian Davidson translated it 
to building 51 houses an hour. 
  But Mr van Zyl said: "Let's get it started and see what can 
be done." 
  Mr Jan Landman of the Freedom Front said those occupying the 
houses should be allowed to own them. Not allowing this in the 
past had been a mistake by the NP [National Party]. He warned 
against a social welfare system whereby the state was milked of 
resources. 
  Ms Gertrude Mzizi of the Inkatha Freedom Party congratulated 
Mr Sexwale for allowing hostel dwellers to choose between living 
in single-sex dormitories or family units. 
  The Pan Africanist Congress' sole representative, Mr Benny 
Alexander, said Mr Sexwale's housing goal was achievable and 
suggested the masses be trained to build the houses. 
  Mr Davidson referred to reports that at most 70,000 low-cost 
houses could be built in 1995. 
  "Contrary to (Mr Sexwale's) undertaking...informed comment 
seems to indicate that we have neither the financial nor 
institutional capacity to deliver... 
  "Let me not be misunderstood. Let us recommit ourselves to 
our challenges but let us also be conscious of the reality of 
institutional capacity and the reality imposed by our commitment 
also to maintain macro-economic balance." 
  Mr Davidson further warned the PWV needed to compete with 
what he called two other major economic areas, the Western Cape 
and KwaZulu/Natal. Each province was controlled by a different 
political party with its own economic philosophy and each would 
compete for local and foreign investment. 
  "We therefore have to allow our province to compete 
unshackled by political or ideological dogma." 
  Mr Davidson said enterprise could not flourish under special 
taxes or reconstruction levies. "A compromise must be reached 
between the necessary ambitious plan of the reconstruction and 
development programme and the private sector's vital role in 
this regard on the one hand, and the necessary commitment to 
economic balance which will be a prerequisite to private-sector 
involvement on the other." 
  Mr Thamsanqa Bam of the African Christian Democratic Party 
welcomed the housing plan. 
  Mr Sexwale will respond at the end of the debate on Tuesday.

  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party has added its voice to the 
widespread praise still pouring in for Mr. Mandela's revised 
reconstruction program announced in his state of the nation 
address in Parliament yesterday. IFP spokesman Hennie Bekker 
said his party would support the plan as far as it was practical 
and feasible, but there was cause for concern that expectations 
were being created that could not be fulfilled. Industry and 
commerce, as well as politicians across the spectrum, including 
the National Party, the Democratic Party, and the Pan-Africanist 
Congress, have already expressed their support for the 
president's vision. Others, like the Freedom Front, expressed 
guarded optimism.

  [Text] Cape Town May 24 SAPA -- The government of national 
unity would prepare a white paper setting out the details of the 
Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP], Minister Without 
Portfolio Mr Jay Naidoo told a media briefing in Cape Town on 
Tuesday. Mr Naidoo and Finance Deputy Minister Alec Erwin were 
providing details of the RDP announced by President Nelson 
Mandela in his state of the nation address to the opening of 
Parliament. 
  Mr Naidoo said the white paper would differ from the RDP set 
out by the African National Congress during its election 
campaign. The ANC said then its RDP would cost R[Rand]39-billion. 
  Asked whether the RDP agreed to by the cabinet of the 
government of national unity differed from the ANC's plan, Mr 
Naidoo replied: "Absolutely". 
  In his speech to Parliament, Mr Mandela said the cabinet had 
reached consensus "on many elements of a plan broadly based on 
that (the ANC's) Programme for Reconstruction and Development". 
  Mr Erwin explained that the RDP had been discussed with a 
wide variety of stakeholders and changes had been introduced. 
The new plan would be set out in the white paper. 
  Mr Naidoo said he would be responsible for the white paper 
in 
conjunction with the Departments of Finance and State 
Expenditure. 
  As a "kickstart" to the RDP, Mr Mandela announced that 
R2.5-billion had been set aside. The fund would be increased by 
R2.5-billion a year for five years. 
  The initial R2.5bn was derived from redirecting government 
spending priorities. 
  However, increased economic growth could boost the fund to 
well beyond the R12.5-billion total at the end of the five-year 
period, Mr Erwin said. 
  The fund would not be used like the Independent Development 
Trust Fund in which individual projects were financed. 
  Mr Naidoo's office would be responsible for programmes and 
budgeting.

  [Text] ANC Member of Parliament Carl Niehaus says a truth 
commission should be set up to disclose, as he put it, all 
misdeeds and crimes committed during the apartheid era. Mr. 
Niehaus said in Parliament that this was necessary to complete 
the process of reconciliation and forgiveness. However, he 
emphasized that it should not be translated into a process 
similar to that used in the Nuremberg trials. Mr. Justice 
Richard Goldstone, also speaking in Cape Town, called for the 
establishment of a truth commission on apartheid atrocities 
because, as he put it, the victims would not be able to forgive 
without openness. He said multiple prosecutions had to be 
avoided and that it was essential to expose the past as part of 
the process of healing.

  [Text] The minister of safety and security affairs, Mr. 
Sydney Mufamadi, has announced plans for a sweeping 
restructuring of the police services to create a demilitarized 
national and provincial force. Mr. Mufamadi also said that 
interim structures had been created in the form of three bodies 
to plan and oversee the process. The process will include 
combining the South African Police [SAP] and homeland police 
forces, removing military ranks, symbols and terminology, and 
applying affirmative action to make the force and its leadership 
more representative. It also aimed at removing discrimination 
against women. 
  Mr. Mufamadi also announced that Lieutenant General Basie 
Smit, the last of three police generals under investigation on 
Goldstone Commission charges of alleged involvement in a third 
force, is leaving the force within the next two days. Two 
others, Major General Krappies Engelbrecht and Major General 
Johan le Roux, have already retired. Mr. Mufamadi said an SAP 
act would be promulgated to provide for the appointment of a 
national police commissioner and commissioners in charge of 
policing in the nine provinces. 
  Deputy Minister Joe Matthews said closer cooperation would 
be 
forged with South Africa's neighbors to try to curb arms 
trafficking in the region. Mr. Matthews said that immunity 
would be granted to those willing to hand in their illegal 
weapons and ammunition to the police. He expressed the hope 
that the level of illegal arms trafficking would drop with the 
reduction in political violence.

  [Text] Deputy Land Affairs Minister Tobie Meyer says the 
government has not planned drastic action to expropriate or 
redistribute land. Speaking at the congress of the South 
African Agricultural Union in Port Elizabeth, Mr. Meyer said 
access to the farming sector would be broadened with the 
allocation of funds and introduction of measures to assist 
novice farmers. Farmers, he said, would also be settled on 
available state land, but under no circumstances would the 
government confiscate or nationalize existing farmers' land.

  [Text] South African farmers are to establish themselves 
temporarily in other African states, in terms of a new feeding 
policy for the continent. 
  This emerged after talks held by the Transvaal and [Orange] 
Free State Agricultural Unions and the leader of the Freedom 
Front, General Constand Viljoen, with the United Nations, the 
Commonwealth, and international institutions on a feeding 
strategy for South Africa and the rest of the continent. The 
president of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, Mr. Dries Bruwer, 
said talks would be held on the same issue next week with 
President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. Mr. 
Bruwer said South African farmers would give practical help and 
advice on crop cultivation. The strategy would initially be 
confined to countries south of the equator, but would later be 
expanded northwards. 
  Mr. Bruwer said the plan had to be introduced as soon as 
possible to prevent a flood of people from neighboring states.

  [Text] Umtata May 24 SAPA -- Eastern Cape Premier Raymond 
Mhlaba has banned strikes and protests by provincial civil 
servants, according to a circular discouraging what he called 
civil disobedience. The circular was sent to directors-general 
of provincial departments on Tuesday. 
  Mr Mhlaba said numerous complaints by civil servants had 
been 
received by his office and he noted them with sympathy, concern 
and appreciation. Committees to be nominated by the various 
political parties would deal with all grievances and imbalances. 
Until then: 
  -- no new appointments or re-appointments would be made; 
  -- no further promotions would be effected directly or 
indirectly; 
  -- no improvement of remuneration or conditions of service 
would be processed, whether for parity purposesor not; and 
  -- no contractual agreements would be made, unless money had 
been budgeted and contracts already negotiated. 
  Such contracts had to be discussed with the relevant MEC 
[Member Executive council] before submission to the Executive 
Council. 
  Mr Mhlaba said the former public service commissions of 
Transkei and Ciskei should compile a list of grievances to 
facilitate the work of the committees. 
  He called on civil servants to desist from work stoppages, 
go-slows, strikes or withholding their best service. 
  He said the circular had been issued to curb an 
unprecedented 
high rate of recurrent expenditure in the province. 
  The curbs would be lifted when normality returned to the 
civil service.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Approval for Defense Minister -- An editorial in 
Johannesburg 
THE STAR in English on 26 May on page 20 voices approval for 
Defense Minister Joe Modise's appointment of General Georg 
Meiring as head of the South African National Defense Force, 
SANDF: "We applaud this move; we salute Defence Minister Joe 
Modise for choosing the best man for the job. His vision is 
clear: a legitimate, credible, balanced, modern and 
technologically advanced military force with internationally 
accepted professional norms, also fully representative." 
Turning to related issues, the editorial notes: "Three other 
points in the Minister's announcement need to be noted: the 
realistic pegging of the force at about 70,000 men, the 
preference for a voluntary system of enlistment and the emphasis 
on a positive internal role for the SANDF. All this augurs well 
for the future." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Concern Over `ANC Militarists' -- "The arms embargo against 
South Africa is about to be lifted. Perhaps it would be better 
for us all if it remained in force." Such is the sentiment an 
editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 26 May on 
page 8. Noting that ANC hawks and doves are beginning to divide 
over the questions affecting the South African military, the 
paper states: "We have a situation where Minister Jay Naidoo 
repeatedly said the reconstruction and development programme 
would be paid for predominantly through defence cuts. Now 
Modise, preceded by some advance guard intellectuals and 
intelligence operatives such as Rocky Williams and Abba Omar, 
are fighting tooth and nail to preserve and perhaps even enlarge 
the military establishment." The editorial rejects as 
"self-serving nonsense" all arguments that the arms industry 
creates needed jobs, and then it continues: "Modise also seeks 
to make South Africa the policeman of the subcontinent, but 
simultaneously and disingenuously asks neighboring countries not 
to fear our huge military capability." After pointing out that 
"ANC militarists are not having it all their own way," the 
editorial concludes: "If the SANDF needs funding for the 
integration of the various armed forces it should be provided -- 
but only on the understanding that it is to be spent purely on 
demobilisation. The public will accept no more than that." 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  Peacekeeping Force Called "Exercise in Futility" -- "A 
pathetic chapter in the history of the birth of the new South 
Africa comes to a close when the so-called Peacekeeping Force is 
disbanded. Seldom, if ever, in South Africa's proud military 
tradition has there ever been such an exercise in futility at a 
such a high price," begins a page-20 editorial in the 
Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 22 May. "As a spectacle it 
even dwarfs the disastrous task by the now defunct Department of 
Development Aid, concerning the provision of hundreds of unused 
toilets, which served as a great source of amusement to 
antigovernment agents. Since the shoe is on the other foot -- 
the Peace Force was the creation of the ANC-dominated 
Transitional Executive Council -- the laughter is considerably 
more subdued. Even for this laughter the South African taxpayer 
will eventually have to foot the bill....May such experiments 
never be repeated so hastily again. May the Peacekeeping Force 
rest in peace." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Black American Investors Welcomed -- "The fact that black 
American businessmen and investors are streaming to South Africa 
to take advantage of new opportunities here should be welcomed," 
notes a page-6 editorial in the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans 
on 23 May. "America's own success story can be partly attributed 
to the fact that it succeeded in attracting investors and 
experts from around the world because it is regarded as the land 
of opportunity. South Africa's developed infrastructure, 
financial sectors, and communication systems are assets that 
will also hopefully attract foreign investors. Black Americans 
returning to their roots in Africa come from a western and 
capitalist society. They have the necessary knowledge required 
to reconcile the Africa culture with a democratic and capitalist 
system....They are also aware of minority issues. Their 
participation in South Africa could help to establish a 
democratic culture based on a firm capitalist, economic 
foundation, but one with its own unique Africa flavor."

  [Text] Former NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction 
Assembly] Government President Charles Gankay Taylor has spoken 
harshly against the frequent wave of attacks on the NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia], in the wake of the 
ongoing peace process. President Taylor said these attacks are 
heavily concentrated on areas where NPFL has demobilized its 
forces, particularly in Compound No. 2 in Grand Bassa County. 
The NPFL leader said his organization is holding ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia] responsible for these attacks, because they were 
present in these areas where the NPFL originally demobilized its 
forces. He reminded ULIMO and ECOMOG that, under the Charter of 
the United Nations, peacekeepers are posted to countries where 
conflicts have gone beyond internal control, requiring the 
involvement of neutral forces to end the conflicts.

  [Text] The United Nations Security Council has lifted the 
arms embargo against South Africa. The arms embargo, the last 
of the United Nations punitive measures against apartheid, was 
lifted after a unanimous decision at the Security Council 
meeting in New York yesterday. The council also rescinded a 
1984 resolution urging all states to refrain from importing 
products of South Africa's own arms industry. 
  In an address before the vote South African Deputy President 
Thabo Mbeki said the move would show that the body had accepted 
that South Africa had become a democratic country. Mr. Mbeki 
called for the speedy creation of a nuclear-weapons-free zone in 
Africa and he asked for help in converting South Africa's 
military technology to civilian uses. 
  It's expected that South Africa could regain its membership 
of the United Nations General Assembly as early as next month, 
after an absence of 20 years.

  [Text] National Assembly May 25 SAPA -- South Africa's 
Parliament now belonged to everybody and the distinction between 
parliamentary and non-parliamentary political groupings should 
disappear forever, second Deputy President Mr F W de Klerk said 
on Wednesday. 
  Speaking first in the debate on the president's opening of 
Parliament speech, Mr de Klerk said he had no regrets about 
events flowing from his February 1990 speech that unbanned the 
African National Congress. "With your presence in this chamber 
Parliament is at long last complete," Mr de Klerk said. 
"Welcome to you -- and welcome to the millions of South 
Africans, whom we all together for the first time in our 
history, represent ?n this highest council of our country." 
  He said the National Party [NP] was prepared to play its 
part 
in putting South Africa first. 
  Mr de Klerk said the NP welcomed the theme of a 
"people-centred society" which was a theme of Mr Mandela's 
address. The theme had the potential to resolve a philosophical 
debate. 
  The NP also supported the Reconstruction and Development 
Programme [RDP] outlined by Mr Mandela. "The NP 
enthusiastically supports most of the objectives of the RDP. 
Many of the goals in the programme are also goals which have 
for years been pursued by the NP. The main problem did not lie 
in our willingness to meet the needs of the people, but in the 
willingness of a large sector of our people to accept services 
from a government which they regarded as illegitimate. This 
problem has at last been removed," he said. 
  There was a risk, however, that the RDP would be 
prescriptive 
and invite government intervention. 
  Non-material needs like reconciliation, culture and security 
were also important. There was broad consensus on these issues. 
Progress was reflected by the relaxed manner in which the 
elections took place, the spontaneous warmth generated by the 
ceremonial activities, and the spirit of co-operation in the 
government of national unity. Sentiment had to become reality. 
  The constitution protected the status of English and 
Afrikaans and gave increased status to other languages. "It is 
of the greatest importance that these measures are implemented. 
And yet we find some government corporations not acting 
according to the spirit and the letter of the constitution," he 
said. 
  Minority rights were suspect during the apartheid era. "It 
was associated with apartheid, racism and discrimination. In 
the post- apartheid era, we South Africans will have to address 
this issue fairly and squarely. The realities of our country 
demand it -- the multicultural and multi-linguistic nature of 
our great nation demands of us to focus on the question of 
effective protection of minority rights." 
  Mr de Klerk quoted from the United Nations "Declaration on 
the Rights of Persons Belonging to Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities" and said the issue of minority rights 
"will need to be addressed more fundamentally than is the case 
in our present transitional constitution". 
  However, the Freedom Front's proposed "volkstaat" [Afrikaner 
homeland] was not attainable and would lead to a new form of 
discrimination which the NP could not support. 
  While the NP was committed to the concept of one-city, one- 
taxpayer, there was a case for devolving control of some 
government functions to the neighbourhood level. Local schools 
and old age homes could be administered at the neighbourhood 
level in the interests of the communities they served.

  [Text] The UN Commission on Human Rights has appointed a 
human rights special investigator to Rwanda. Mr. Rene 
Degni-Segui of Cote d'Ivoire has been appointed to investigate 
the massacres in Rwanda and report to the UN secretary general. 
The UN Commission on Human Rights, sitting in Geneva on 24 May 
1994, condemned what they called the silence of the government 
in Rwanda on the massacres that have been going on. 
  What the UN Commission on Human Rights failed to pronounce 
is 
that the illegitimate government in Rwanda did not keep quiet 
about the massacres in Rwanda, but the government directed the 
massacres. The president and the prime minister of the 
illegitimate government in Rwanda have been using Radio Rwanda 
and Radio RTLM [Radio- Television Libre des Mille Collines] to 
instruct the Rwandan Government forces and the Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development militias to kill 
all the people of Tutsi ethnic groups and everybody who does not 
support the self-imposed government. This government has said 
that whoever is not ready to kill the political opponents of the 
government should be killed.

  [Excerpts] The opposition political parties Republic 
Democratic Movement [MDR], Social Democratic Party [PSD], 
Liberal Party [PL], and Christian Democratic Party [PDC] have 
said that the deployment of the UN force to Rwanda has come too 
late, for hundreds of thousands of people have already been 
killed. In a letter to the United Nations dated 20 May 1994, 
the political parties said that the role of the UN force to 
Rwanda is expected to be exclusively humanitarian. The force 
should not be used to protect criminals responsible for the 
genocide in Rwanda. These should be tried in an international 
tribunal. [passage omitted] 
  The political parties want the deployment of the extra UN 
forces to Rwanda to coincide with the setting up of an 
international commission of inquiry to investigate the genocide 
that has been committed in Rwanda. The political parties MDR, 
PSD, PL and PDC, commonly known as the Democratic Forces of 
Change, believe that the cease-fire should be negotiated between 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front and the Rwandan Government forces 
because the government in Rwanda is illegitimate and has been 
responsible for the massacres in the country. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kinshasa, May 27 (AFP) -- Activity in central 
Kinshasa ground to a standstill Friday [27 May] as shops, 
offices and markets closed following a call for public protest 
by the radical wing of Zaire's opposition. Supporters of 
Etienne Tshisekedi, one of Zaire's rival "prime ministers" and 
an implacable foe of President Mobutu Sese Seko, called on 
people not to go to work to press for implementation of a 
transitional constitution. 
  Few vehicles took to the streets of central Kinshasa, and in 
outlying districts of the capital, such as Massina, Lemba and 
Linguala, children played football in wide avenues empty of 
traffic. Trains owned by the private companies City-Train and 
Sotraz were running but largely empty. 
  The radical wing of the Sacred Union opposition movement 
called for the work stoppage after the transitional parliament 
seized all the files of candidates for the post of prime 
minister. The radicals consider Tshisekedi, who was appointed 
premier by a national conference convened four years ago, the 
only opposition candidate, but moderates in the Sacred Union 
have put up three other names. Mobutu sacked Tshisekedi last 
year and appointed a new prime minister, Faustin Birindwa, but 
the opposition leader has refused to recognise his dismissal. 
  No trouble was reported during the protest Friday. 
  In Zaire's second city, Lubumbashi, capital of the 
mineral-rich southeastern province of Shaba, work continued as 
usual, according to several sources in the private sector 
reached by telephone. Shaba has declared its autonomy, amid 
economic and political chaos in the country.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There has been crisis in the capital of Djibouti 
between members of the Afar and Somali-speaking Issa 
communities. At least one person died in the disturbances and 
several were injured. It all comes at a time when the 
government of Hassan Gouled Aptidon is having talks with the 
splinter groups of the rebel Afar-led movement, FRUD [Front for 
the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]. From Djibouti, 
Christophe Farah telexed this report. 
  Yesterday, the predominantly Afar neighborhood of Ahiba was 
the scene of violent clashes between Afars and Somali-speaking 
residents from the nearby residential suburbs of Gechamale. The 
minister of interior, in a statement issued today, deplored the 
violence and said that gangs of hooligans had damaged the high 
school. Riot police units were rushed to the scene of the 
battle. Although they succeeded in restoring law and order, the 
police are still deployed along the route to Dakka, which is the 
road that separates the antagonistic neighborhoods of Ahiba and 
Gechamale. 
  Today the minister of interior called on the population to 
stay calm and protect public property. The incident coincides 
with behind-the-doors contacts between the government and a 
breakaway faction of FRUD. Last Monday, Prime Minister Barkat 
Gourad Hamadou, reportedly met with Mr. (Ugure Kisle), a FRUD 
military commander. (Kisle) claims to be the new leader of the 
Afar rebellion and over recent months he has publicly announced 
his readiness to engage in dialogue with the government. News 
of the meeting may have prompted the radical wing of the Afar 
community to work up the residents of Ahiba against any deal. 
The people of Ahiba have on many occasions organized 
demonstrations in a bid to show their loyalty to the FRUD 
faction led by Ahmed Dini.

accepted the request of the UN to send her troops to Rwanda. 
Ethiopia accepted the request in accordance with the UN Security 
Council's resolution No. 918 on 17th May 1994, asking all member 
states to send troops toward the UN peacekeeping force in 
Rwanda, which was passed to Ethiopia through the secretary 
general of the organization. The ministry of foreign affairs 
added that Ethiopia has acknowledged her acceptance of the 
request in a letter written to Mr. Butrus-Butrus Ghali dated 
20th May 1994.

  [Excerpt] President Daniel arap Moi said today that it is 
extremely difficult to resolve the internecine civil war in 
Rwanda by force of arms. He therefore pleaded with the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front and the Government troops to lay down arms and 
resolve their differences amicably for the good of all Rwandese 
people. President Moi said continued slaughter of people would 
only deepen hate and vengefulness. 
  He was speaking at State House, Nairobi, when receiving 
credentials from the new high commissioner of Zimbabwe, Mr. 
Lucas Pande Tavaya. 
  Noting that attempts to solve the problem militarily would 
only kill more people, President Moi proposed that the African 
way of peaceful negotiations be adopted. He expressed his 
sorrow at the continuing blood-bath in Rwanda. 
  Welcoming Mr. Tavaya, President Moi said he would continue 
working closely with President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe for the 
good of the two peoples through such organizations as the PTA 
[Preferential Trade Area] and COMESA [Common Market for East and 
Southern Africa] [passage omitted] 
  The new high commissioner applauded President Moi for his 
efforts and personal initiative in promoting peace and economic 
cooperation in the region. Later President Moi bade farewell to 
the outgoing Ambassador of Argentina Mr. Rafael Gowland.

  [Text] Nairobi, 25 May (AFP) -- The United Nations has 
sponsored a new round of peace talks in southern Somalia, but 
many Somali faction leaders failed to turn up, a UN spokesman 
said Wednesday [25 May]. Leaders of a southern faction allied 
to warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid were absent from the opening of 
the talks in the port city of Kismaayo on Tuesday, attended by 
the leader of a rival group, Mohamed Said Hersi, known as 
"General Morgan," son-in-law of ousted ruler Mohamed Siad Barre. 
Aidid's chief financier Osman Ato was there, but Somali 
analysts said it was unclear whether Ato was still a close 
advisor to the warlord. 
  Kismaayo, 500 kilometres (300 miles) south-west of the 
capital Mogadishu, has been repeatedly battered by fighting 
between two rival factions of the Somali Patriotic Movement 
[SPM], one led by Morgan and the other, allied with Aidid, by 
Omar Jays. 
  Neither Jays nor other key figures from the rival SPM group 
such as Aden Abdullahi Noor Gabyo turned up. They were said to 
be "resolving differences between themselves" and might come to 
the Lower Juba regional peace conference which is to last at 
least a week in a few days, said spokesman George Bennett. 
  Previous UN efforts to broker a peace accord among Somalia's 
15 warring factions have failed to end anarchy in the 
war-ravaged Horn of Africa nation. Peace talks including all 
main faction leaders are scheduled to open in Nairobi at the end 
of this month.

  [Text] Monrovia, 27 May (AFP) -- Violent fighting has 
broken out since yesterday at Tubmanburg, 60 km north of 
Monrovia -- headquarters of the armed Liberian faction, the 
United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO] -- 
between Mandingos and Krahns, the two ethnic clans within the 
movement which have been fighting since March. Gerald Van Djik, 
the World Food Program [WFP] representative in Monrovia, told 
AFP today that the hostilities broke out when a WFP team was 
distributing 81 tonnes of food in the town. He was unable to 
assess the casualties among the fighters and the civilian 
population.

  [Text] Former NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction 
Assembly] Government President Charles Gankay Taylor has spoken 
harshly against the frequent wave of attacks on the NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia], in the wake of the 
ongoing peace process. President Taylor said these attacks are 
heavily concentrated on areas where NPFL has demobilized its 
forces, particularly in Compound No. 2 in Grand Bassa County. 
The NPFL leader said his organization is holding ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia] responsible for these attacks, because they were 
present in these areas where the NPFL originally demobilized its 
forces. He reminded ULIMO and ECOMOG that, under the Charter of 
the United Nations, peacekeepers are posted to countries where 
conflicts have gone beyond internal control, requiring the 
involvement of neutral forces to end the conflicts.

  [Text] Former NPRA [National Patriotic Reconstruction 
Assembly] government President Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor says 
Liberia is at a crucial and opportune time for achieving lasting 
peace provided the courage of removing all obstacles from the 
Cotonou Agreement is put into place. Speaking during a press 
conference in Gbarnga today, Mr. Taylor said it is of crucial 
importance to remove all external threats presently being caused 
by the LPC [Liberian Peace Council] with the help of ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] from the Cotonou peace process in order for disarmament, 
encampment, and demobilization to commence. 
  Mr. Taylor said the LPC and the Nigerian contingent of 
ECOMOG 
pose a continuous threat to stability in Liberia. The NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader said if Nigeria 
must remain a part of the peace process in Liberia, Nigerians 
must shape up or else they will have to ship out. President 
Taylor said there are some good elements within the Nigerian 
ECOMOG contingent but Nigerian soldiers with bad peacekeeping 
records must be withdrawn from Liberia. 
  The former president reiterated the commitment of the NPFL 
to 
the current peace process but warned of the danger plan by AFL 
[Armed Forces of Liberia] commanding General Hezekiah Bowen to 
unleash a Kigali situation in Liberia. He cautioned all 
factions to exercise restraint and follow the South African 
example in order to restore peace to the people of this country 
suffering in and out of Liberia.

  [Text] As havoc and indiscriminate slaughter of civilians 
continue in the southeast of Liberia, indisputable evidence has 
emerged that the motives behind the LPC [Liberia Peace Council] 
mayhem is to depopulate and (?hurt) the entire southeast of the 
country. LPC fighters are frustrated over failure to gain any 
substantial support and ground from the Bassa, Kru, Grebo, and 
even some Krahn citizens in the south and southeast of the 
country and their unprovoked battle against the NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia]. [sentence as heard] Eyewitnesses 
say the LPC has unleashed a reign of mayhem on these citizens, 
because LPC is of the notion that these citizens [are] original 
supporters of the NPFL. 
  Political analysts are also of the conviction that the 
current wave of violence to depopulate the southeast is intended 
to deplete the area of potential voters, who are all likely to 
vote for the NPFL in the ensuing general and presidential 
elections in Liberia this year.

  [Text] As you probably know, the ULIMO [United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction in Liberia is itself 
bitterly split into warring splinter groups -- Alhaji Koromah's 
section and Roosevelt Johnson's followers. They have been 
slugging each other off and fighting each other for weeks. Now, 
General Kamina of Alhaji Koromah's military command has called 
us up to launch a scathing attack on the ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] 
peacekeeping force, and especially the Nigerians. Robin White 
asked him what his complaint was: 
  [Begin recording] [Kamina] They have been aiding the 
dissident group to bring total split into ULIMO forces and to 
derail the entire peace process. 
  [White] Why on earth should the Nigerians want to do that? 
  [Kamina] Sure, they have been promised a lot of things. 
These guys have told them that they are going toward the 
diamond mining areas and other areas. This is the Nigerian 
ECOMOG particularly I'm talking about. Most of them on the 
ground with the command of General Togun, they have been 
promised everything on the ground there; that they are going to 
get everything, all the wealth and resources. 
  [White] It does seem most unlikely. I mean ECOMOG and 
Nigerian troops are there to try and keep the warring factions 
apart. 
  [Kamina] I am telling you that they have been aiding and 
transporting arms and ammunition through everywhere. Through 
Tubmanburg and along the route side, they are carrying on these 
dissident forces there, transporting them and derailing the 
whole peace process. These guys are plenty men. They are 
having men disguised into ECOMOG uniform, fighting all along 
[words indistinct] to Tubmanburg. 
  [White] So is your faction currently losing? 
  [Kamina] We are not losing. We are determined to fight but 
we want to register this to the world that the ECOMOG forces, 
the Nigerian contingent, are on the ground and continue to aid 
the dissident forces that we are still fighting and we want to 
tell the world that we will never relent. We will keep fighting 
this thing here until ECOMOG, the Nigerian contingent is [word 
indistinct] from that ground totally. 
  [White] Aren't you just blaming the Nigerians for what after 
all are your own problems? 
  [Kamina] I am saying that the Nigerians, particularly 
wherever they are there is a problem there. Even the LPC 
[Liberian Peace Council] to see for itself. They have created 
another group in Charles Taylor area to support the LPC thing.

  [Text] Monrovia, 25 May (AFP) -- Four members of two 
Liberian armed factions were killed and 12 civilians injured 
when the lorry they were riding on ran over a mine north of the 
port town of Buchanan, the Defense Ministry said Wednesday [25 
May]. 
  Those killed were a colonel of the Armed Forces of Liberia 
(AFL) and three guerrillas in a recently emerged faction, the 
Liberian Peace Council (LPC), ministry spokesman Arthur Dennis 
said. 
  The presence of an AFL general staff officer in the company 
of LPC fighters has stirred up new suspicions that the AFL 
helped form the new armed movement last September in a bid 
indirectly to pursue a conflict with Liberia's main armed 
faction, the National Patriotic Front (NPFL). 
  But Dennis said "it is not the AFL that sent (the colonel) 
to 
the territory. He went to the LPC-controlled area on his own." 
  The LPC, which currently controls the region on Liberia's 
central coastline where the truck hit the mine, has declared 
that the NPFL is its avowed enemy. It is not a party to a peace 
pact signed in July last year among the NPFL, the AFL and a 
third faction, the United Liberation Movement (ULIMO). 
  Dennis said that 10 of the civilians travelling with the 
fighters when the mine blast occurred Sunday had been taken to 
hospital in serious condition.

  [Text] Lagos, 27 May (AFP) -- The National Democratic 
Coalition [NADECO] today renewed its ultimatum to General Sani 
Abacha to hand over power to the winner of the 12 June 1993 
presidential elections by 31 May. 
  Yoruba Chief Moshood Abiola proclaimed himself winner of the 
said elections, annulled by President Ibrahim Babangida's 
military government on the grounds of electoral malpractices. 
  In a full-page communique published in THE GUARDIAN 
newspaper, NADECO which is composed of prominent figures, 
retired Army officers, former ministers and state governors, 
appealed to Nigerians to boycott the 28 May second round of 
balloting to elect district delegates to the upcoming 
constitutional conference. The constitutional conference is 
scheduled to begin on 27 June in Abuja. 
  NADECO had earlier called for the boycott of the first round 
held on 23 May. "It is obvious that the 23 May elections were a 
big failure," the coalition observed. 
  "The massive boycott of the ward elections is a expression 
of 
defiance for Gen. Abacha's regime," the communique stated. The 
communique was signed by NADECO Secretary General Ayo Opadokun.

  [Text] The chief of general staff [CGS], Lieutenant General 
Oladipo Diya, has again explained that the entry of the military 
into government is not to perpetuate military rule but to save 
the country from disintegration. Gen. Diya stated this 
yesterday in Abuja when he received a special message from Pope 
John Paul II on behalf of the head of state. He stated that the 
present administration would not relent in its efforts to return 
the country to democratic rule. The CGS told the envoy that the 
democratization process had already commenced with the peaceful 
elections to the Constitutional Conference. He commended the 
role of the church in the current efforts to shape the political 
future of the country. 
  Earlier, the envoy of the pope and ambassador of the Holy 
See 
in Nigeria, Dr. (Carlo Maria Gigano), had briefed the CGS on 
activities to mark the forthcoming International Year of the 
Family and the International Conference on Development and 
Population.

  [Text] The chief of defense staff, Major General 
Abdul-Salam Abubakar, has expressed concern over the incessant 
verbal attacks on the government by the retired military 
officers. Gen. Abubakar made his feelings known yesterday in 
Owerri at the opening of the fourth national conference of 
retired Army, Navy, and Air Force officers. Sola Kudaefe reports: 
  [Begin Kudaefe recording] The chief of defense staff said 
that it was politically unprofessional for retired officers to 
attack military institutions and therefore carry away the spirit 
of esprit de corps they were taught while in service. Gen. 
Abubakar spoke of the need for them to be mindful of their 
public utterances as the general public will tend to believe 
whatever they said as truth. 
  Another issue that is of concern to Gen. Abubakar is wearing 
of military ranks by retired officers involved in partisan 
politics. He contended that this was a source of embarrassment 
to the serving officers and therefore called on the conference 
of the retired Army, Navy, and Air Force officers to offer 
recommendations on the possibility of disallowing those of them 
involved in partisan politics from wearing their military ranks. 
He gave the assurance that the government will always promote 
their welfare but quickly added that government alone could not 
do it and called on private sectors to help in this direction. 
  In his address, the military administrator of Imo State, 
Navy 
Captain James Aniko, pledged that his administration will accord 
priority to the welfare of retired officers and men of the Armed 
Forces. Navy Capt. Aniko, however, called on the retired 
officers to offer useful advice and to assist him in his 
programs. 
  Earlier, the general secretary of retired officers club, 
Retired Colonel (Yakubu Anikolasue), called for the 
harmonization of pensions and gratuities of retired members.

  [Excerpts] Lagos, 25 May (AFP) -- Politicians in 
southeastern Nigeria have formed a new party in defiance of a 
government ban and called on the junta of General Sani Abacha to 
stand down, press reports said here Wednesday [25 May]. The 
People's Mandate Party was formed in the city of Enugu last week 
as an offshoot of the Eastern Mandate Union (EMU) grouping 
prominent politicians from seven states in the region, the 
reports said. 
  In a statement, the group demanded that Abacha relinquish 
power by June 30 to make way for a sovereign national conference 
on Nigeria's political future, and said it was "agreeable" to 
the possible validation of the outcome of a presidential 
election annulled by a previous military regime last June. That 
poll, said by international observers to be free and fair, was 
generally held to have been won by millionaire businessman 
Moshood Abiola, but then junta chief General Ibrahim Babangida 
alleged there had been irregularities. 
  The EMU said it could embark on the organisation of a 
sovereign national conference and the establishment of a 
government of national unity with like-minded political 
organisations elsewhere in the country. 
  It was not clear whether the new group was affiliated to the 
recently-formed National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a 
pro-democracy movement comprising prominent politicians, retired 
military officers and ex-political office holders from states in 
the southwest, southeast and middle belt of the country. NADECO 
masterminded a boycott Monday in much of Nigeria of the first 
round of elections to a constitutional conference which the 
regime plans to organise at the end of June, as part of a plan 
it has presented to restore civilian rule. [passage omitted] 
  The EMU, led by former presidential candidate Patrick Dele 
Cole, also revived old charges that the east of the country has 
been marginalised within the military and proposed the 
establishment of regional commands to decentralise the Armed 
Forces. In 1967-70, Nigeria was wracked by a civil war that 
ended the secessionist aspirations of the mainly Ibo-peopled 
east, which tried to form the separate state of Biafra.

  [Text] The more than two-year fuel scarcity in Kano State 
has disappeared with all the filling stations in the capital 
having fuel. The long queues of vehicles witnessed during the 
fuel crisis have been eliminated, improving the movement of 
vehicles in the state. 
  Meanwhile, the military administrator, Colonel Mohamed Wase, 
has directed the reconstituted task force on the fuel scarcity 
to report daily to his office on the supply and movement of fuel 
tankers. During an unscheduled visit to the depot, the 
administrator directed the task force to discourage touts from 
besieging the premises of the depot. Col. Mohamed Wase then 
lifted the order prohibiting the sale of more than 100 naira 
fuel to motorists.

<F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister Edem Kodjo in Lome on 25 May -- </F>
recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow Togolese and dear countrymen: It is a month 
since the head of state entrusted me with the duty of forming 
the first government of the Fourth Republic, and thus to outline 
and conduct national policy in accordance with the spirit and 
letter of the Constitution. First and foremost, I would like to 
thank you once again and to pay you tribute for the courage, 
determination, and sense of civic duty you have displayed since 
the beginning of the process to democratize our country and our 
institutions. 
  After the 6 and 20 February legislative elections, you 
entrusted the responsibility of managing national affairs on 
your behalf to the parliamentary majority comprising the Action 
Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for Democracy 
[UTD]. It is within the framework of this parliamentary 
majority and, therefore, the victory of yesterday's 
opposition--your victory--that I was appointed prime minister by 
the president of the Republic, by virtue of Article 66 of the 
Constitution which stipulates that the head of state shall 
appoint the prime minister from within the parliamentary 
majority. 
  My sole concern, in accepting this post, was to save this 
parliamentary majority. My concern was also to give all the 
chances to the former opposition, together with all the 
political forces, to accomplish change, which remains the 
primary objective of the battle we have been waging for three 
years. We have all realized that beyond our individual 
personalities and political structures, there is our country 
Togo and all the Togolese people with their numerous everyday 
problems and difficulties. 
  Centering the debate on how to jointly manage the present 
situation and to downplay our divisions seem to me, today, to be 
a major priority. It is with the interest of the suffering 
Togolese people who expect a better tomorrow in mind that I, in 
my capacity as prime minister, have just formed a government 
under the terms of the Constitution. I shall submit to 
parliament the joint government program agreed upon by the CAR 
and the UTD and leave it to each of the deputies, as 
representatives of the people, to study and decide on it. 
  The problems which our country has to cope with are many and 
urgent. We must ensure that there is genuine national 
reconciliation by extending a brotherly hand to all. It is to 
this end that the CAR and the UTD accepted the idea of a 
government of national union proposed by the head of state. 
  We must also settle, once and for all, the problem of our 
countrymen who are still living as refugees outside the country, 
as well as the problem of displaced persons within the country. 
We must ensure the regular payment of salaries of workers and 
pensions of the retired. 
  We must stop the continuing deterioration of the economic 
situation of the state and enterprises which are faced with very 
great difficulties and adopt adequate measures that will help to 
keep under control the negative effects of the devaluation of 
the CFA franc on our economy and on the purchasing power of 
Togolese. We must create conditions that will allow women 
traders and the informal sector to recover their former 
dynamism. We must find solutions to the specific problems of 
our farmers and the rural areas in general. We must find 
appropriate measures to end the current malfunctioning of our 
schools and university -- the University of Benin -- and to 
restore hope in the youth by securing a more promising future 
for them. 
  At the political level, we must rapidly give the democratic 
opposition a legal statute to enable it to exist legally, to 
fully play its constitutional role, and to work toward the 
return of all politicians into politics, regardless of their 
political leanings, through fruitful, open, and brotherly 
dialogue. We must adopt as early as possible the organic laws 
that will govern the institutions that are indispensable for the 
setting up of a law-abiding state and adopt measures for the law 
to be in the service of all. We must see to the reinforcement 
of public security and promote freedom of opinion, meeting, and 
association. In this regard, we must lay particular emphasis on 
the media code. Last, one of the major concerns of the 
government that I will lead will be that of sound and equitable 
management of state media in the service of pluralism, 
democracy, and development. 
  Fellow Togolese and dear countrymen, I would like to call 
you 
to witness and to reaffirm to you my indestructible attachment 
to the common objective of change that we have set for 
ourselves. I reaffirm before the entire Togolese people my 
willingness to base government action on the common 
parliamentary majority program with openness and readiness to 
cooperate with all. We must avoid every kind of sectarianism by 
resolutely putting ourselves at the service of the entire 
Togolese people because national interests must override 
partisan considerations. I appeal for the union of all 
democratic forces and all people of goodwill so that we can 
consolidate our efforts in order to respond to the strong desire 
for change expressed by all Togolese. The broad-based 
government of national union will strive tirelessly for the 
attainment of its objectives which are national reconciliation, 
economic redress, and social integration. 
  This government is perhaps not the one we would have wished 
to form but the delay in its formation and the suffering of the 
people have forced us to form it. It must set down to work and 
to try to safeguard the future. With outstretched arms, I hope 
that the appeal that I have just launched will be heeded by all 
political forces desirous of contributing to the redress of our 
country Togo. On my part, I can assure you that I will ensure 
that Togo is governed to the best of its interests. 
  Long live democratic change. Long live Togo.

  [Text] Lome, 26 May (AFP) -- Togolese Prime Minister Edem 
Kodjo's party, the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD], today 
expressed its "satisfaction" at the formation of the new 
government on 25 May. The UTD holds three out of the 19 
ministerial posts. In a communique, it reaffirmed that it 
belonged to the "parliamentary majority" which is made up of six 
UTD and 34 Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] parliamentarians. 
  The CAR has fallen out with Prime Minister Edem Kodjo and 
refused to join the cabinet. It rejects the premier's claim of 
belonging to the "parliamentary majority." 
  In addition to the three UTD ministers, the new cabinet 
includes eight "independent" parliamentarians and eight 
ministers who are close allies of President Gnassingbe Eyadema. 
  The UTD implicitly called on CAR to rescind its decision 
saying the first priority now was to "fill the political vacuum 
and put an end to country's social and economic ruin." The 
party was pleased that it was an open government, in which "the 
people are broadly represented by ministers chosen on the basis 
of competence and efficiency." 
  Just as Premier Edem Kodjo stated yesterday, the UTD also 
expressed its determination to implement the government policy 
formulated in collaboration with the CAR.

leader, Yaovi Agboyibor of the Action Committee for Renewal 
[CAR], in an interview with AFP yesterday evening, "expressed 
regret" that Togolese Prime Minister Edem Kodjo "continues to 
deceive the people by claiming to belong to the parliamentary 
majority." Mr. Kodjo has formed a government in which he has 
attributed eight out of the 19 ministerial posts to President 
Gnassingbe Eyadema's supporters; eight to "independent" 
candidates, and only three to members of the Togolese Union for 
Democracy [UTD], his own party. 
  The opposition CAR and UTD which formed a coalition to 
contest the elections and which won last February's legislative 
elections -- the CAR won 34 out of 78 parliamentary seats and 
the UTD won six -- had agreed to propose Mr. Agboyibor for the 
post of prime minister but to the general surprise, General 
Eyadema on 23 April appointed Mr. Kodjo to form a new 
government. Edem Kodjo, a former dignitary of Eyadema's regime 
and an opposition member "boycotted" by his former political 
"friends," has since his appointment been trying to form his 
government team. "Mr. Kodjo knows very well that he intends to 
rely on another presidential majority to govern the country, as 
reflected in the composition of the government," Mr. Agboyibor 
said. 
  Earlier in the evening, the prime minister told AFP that the 
new government he has just formed is "an interim government." 
He further said that "if the CAR decides to join the 
government, there will be a cabinet reshuffle to enable it to 
take the portfolios due it." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The reaction of Mr. Agboyibor to the new Togolese 
Government has not been slow in coming. The leader of the 
Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] said today that Edem Kodjo 
can no longer say that he is part of the opposition to General 
Eyadema. 
  [Begin recording] [Agboyibor] In many of his statements, in 
particular his introduction to the presentation of his 
government, Mr. Edem Kodjo continues to refer to the Togolese 
Union for Democracy [UTD] - CAR parliamentary majority. But it 
is difficult to know whether he really believes in this 
majority, because, if that were the case, he should behave 
consistently. This means that, once we told him that for 
clearly defined reasons our party, the CAR, cannot join his 
government, he should have drawn the correct conclusion and 
refrained from forming a government. 
  He cannot say, in spite of this refusal, well, I am forming 
this government with the Rally of Togolese People [RPT]. This 
act is an act of rupture with the UDT-CAR parliamentary majority. 
  [Unidentified Correspondent] So if Mr. Kodjo remains in the 
government, he only wants to ally himself with the RPT? 
  [Agboyibor] We have seen this. In a government where the RPT 
has more than 60 percent of the ministeries, while Kodjo has 
scarcely 9 or 10 percent, it is more than partnership, it is an 
alliance. [end recording]

  [Text] Cotonou, 26 May (AFP) -- Bertin Kangni Foli, an 
exiled Togolese opposition activist suspected of having led the 
holdup attempt on an armored bank vehicle in Lome on 13 May, 
died in a Cotonou hospital on 20 May, morgue officials disclosed 
today. 
  He was formerly a journalist but left Togo in September 
1992. 
He is said to be a close ally of Gilchrist Olympio, the radical 
Togolese opposition leader in exile. 
  On 25 May, the Togolese Government accused him of having 
masterminded the 13 May holdup on an armored Central Bank of 
West African States van. The assailants fled, unable to lay 
their hands on the 10 billion CFA francs the van was carrying. 
A police officer was killed during the holdup, and, according 
to Togolese authorities, Mr. Foli was wounded. 
  A source at the Cotonou hospital told AFP Mr. Foli was 
admitted on the night of 13 May following "a road accident" but 
died a week later. The source did not state the nature of Mr. 
Foli's wounds. According to reports from other hospital 
sources, Mr. Foli had previously gone to a private clinic to be 
treated for "gunshot wounds" and registered under a fake name, 
but due to the seriousness of his condition, he was transferred 
to the hospital. 
  Some Togolese people claiming to be Mr. Foli's relatives 
this 
morning transferred the body from the Cotonou hospital to a 
private morgue while awaiting burial. 
  They said their "relative" was a victim of an "attack" in 
Lome on 13 May but managed to flee to Benin.

<F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Alves Antonio] </F>
  [Text] Good afternoon. At the Lusaka talks between the 
government and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola] delegations, the mediator is searching for 
alternative solutions. This morning, Alioune Blondin Beye, UN 
special representative in Angola, received in his hotel room in 
Lusaka the leaders of the two delegations. The meeting lasted 
some three hours, though nothing has been disclosed about the 
issues discussed. It is believed the mediator was informed by 
the negotiators about the meetings they held recently with their 
respective leaders in Luanda and Huambo. Reliable source 
believe this morning's meeting adopted the strategy for the 
resumption of talks interrupted on 20 May. It is also believed 
that the issues to be dealt with by the government and UNITA 
negotiators over the next few hours have been outlined. 
  Meanwhile, we have learned that the government and UNITA 
delegations this morning held separate meetings to adopt a stand 
on issues relating to national reconciliation, namely UNITA's 
participation in the running of the country, the status and 
security of Jonas Savimbi, and the security of senior UNITA 
officials. The first steps have been slow, with the government 
and UNITA negotiators carefully choosing their moves. The 
process could become clearer as of now, but many things may 
happen in these unpredictable talks.

  [Text] The negotiating teams from the government and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] met 
here in Lusaka this afternoon, without the presence of the 
mediators. The meeting dealt with the consultations the 
delegations conducted with their respective leaderships. It is 
not yet known what will be discussed tomorrow because the new 
working program has not yet been concluded. All that is known 
is that the negotiating teams from the government and UNITA will 
meet again tomorrow morning. Tomorrow we shall know what the 
government and UNITA will discuss. 
  When the talks were interrupted, the negotiating teams were 
discussing the future of the Voice of Resistance of the Black 
Cockerel. The leadership of the UNITA negotiating team returned 
to Lusaka yesterday afternoon and it has already held an 
informal meeting with mediator Alioune Blondin Beye.

  [Text] The Central Committee of the Popular Movement for 
the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] ended its session yesterday. 
The Political Bureau [words indistinct] recommendations on the 
strengthening of the Central Committee's role among militants 
and sympathizers. The session also discussed Angolan security 
and made specific recommendations to the government delegation 
taking part in the Lusaka talks. MPLA spokesman Norberto dos 
Santos has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [dos Santos] The Central Committee 
recommended the Political Bureau to assess the activities of the 
party in all echelons and to take the necessary steps to 
strengthen party activities within the Political Bureau, the 
Secretariat, intermediate structures, and grass roots 
organizations. So, it is necessary to revamp party activities 
involving militants, and to increase the flow of information on 
the political and socioeconomic situation. 
  [Unidentified Correspondent] We have learned that the MPLA 
Political Bureau has new members. Would you like to name them? 
  [Dos Santos] Of the 12 nominees, comrades Venancio de Moura 
and Anastacio (da Voca), the first secretary for Huambo 
Province, have been admitted as permanent members. Comrades 
Joao (Chipingue), the first secretary for Huila Province; Moxico 
Province Governor Joao Ernesto dos Santos Liberdade; Benguela 
Province Governor Paulo Teixeira Jorge; and Carlos Ferreira 
Pinto, a former first secretary for Moxico Province, have been 
elected as candidate members. Comrade Carlos Ferreira Pinto has 
also been elected coordinator of the Discipline and Audit 
Committee. The Political Bureau now has 21 members, of which 17 
are permanent and four are candidate members. 
  [Correspondent] Angolans are very worried about the Lusaka 
peace talks. They are also concerned over the Cabinda issue. 
Would you like to confirm whether a peace accord will be signed 
on 6 June? 
  [Dos Santos] The Central Committee session did not discuss 
dates. No date has been set. The Central Committee has only 
recommended the government negotiating team to do its best to 
achieve peace. What the Central Committee discussed was the 
manner in which we will implement the peace accord. The 
principal issue is the organization of domestic structures so 
that the implementation of the peace process does not face the 
same risks the Bicesse Accord experienced. 
  [Correspondent] Does that apply to Cabinda? 
  [Dos Santos] The session heard a report on the situation in 
Cabinda. As you known, no direct talks have been held. So far 
only exploratory meetings have taken place. There are several 
Cabinda factions with whom a government team has held 
exploratory talks. That is in addition to the meeting held in 
Paris. The Central Committee recommended the Political Bureau 
take charge of this issue because one feels that the progress on 
Cabinda is slow. [end recording]

intense fire. Several people have been killed and others 
wounded. We are unable to give the number of victims because of 
the intensity of clashes and shelling. Yet, it is known between 
last night and dawn today, National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola rebels had already fired more than 300 
shells of various caliber at the martyred city. As usual, the 
civil defense, the National Police, and the Angolan Armed Forces 
have halted the destructive wrath of the men from Jamba. We 
expect to give other details in our next report.

  [Text] Maseru May 26 SAPA -- Agreement was reached on 
Thursday between the Lesotho Government and striking police for 
an increase in a series of police allowances. The agreement 
however, did not include the 60 per cent salary increase 
demanded by the striking police. 
  The parties agreed most of the allowances would be doubled. 
The risk allowance had been doubled from R50 [rand] to R100, 
special duty and plainclothes allowance from R25 to R50, and 
mountain allowance from R17 to R25. 
  It believed that the leaders of the police strike will reach 
a compromise agreement with the government following the 
increased allowances, which will also affect the same categories 
of officers in the army,. 
  It has been announced that an independent salary commission 
will be established to review the salary structure for all civil 
servants. 
  Meanwhile, Lesotho's natural resources minister, Mr Monyane 
Moleleki, has resigned, according to an announcement broadcast 
by Radio Lesotho on Thursday. Mr Moleleki's department was 
responsible for the implementation of the Lesotho Highlands 
water scheme which will provide water to South Africa. 
  Mr Moleleki fled into neighbouring Orange Free State last 
week and is now believed to have travelled to Johannesburg.

  [Text] The government has reached an agreement with a 
delegation of police presently on strike for higher salaries 
that has (?set off) allowances for the same categories of 
service in the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police and the Royal 
Lesotho Defense Force will be increased with effect from the 1st 
of June. [sentence as heard] 
  This follows negotiations between a government delegation 
consisting of the honorable minister of home affairs, President 
Lesao Lehohla; the honorable acting minister of finance and 
minister of broadcasting and information, Mr. Mpho Malie; and 
the principal secretary for home affairs, Mr. Abna (Mufase), and 
a police negotiating team of seven officers. The agreed 
increases were as follows: (?briefed) allowance from 50 to 100 
maloti; special duty plain clothes allowance from 25 to 50 
maloti for officers, and from 20 to 40 maloti for junior ranks. 
Mounted allowance from 17 to 25 maloti for junior ranks and for 
officers the allowance will remain at 32 maloti. Patrol 
allowance from 4 maloti to 20 maloti. The allowance for radio 
operators will be as follows: Grade one from eight to 15 maloti; 
grade two from 10 to 20 maloti; grade 3 from 12 to 25 maloti. 
Band allowance from 10 to 20 maloti and land [word indistinct] 
from 22 to 30 maloti. 
  The government spokesman said the doors for further 
negotiations and consultations with the government would remain 
open. Their meetings could always be arranged in consultation 
with the government secretary. As far as the demand for overall 
salary increases were concerned, this matter would be reviewed 
as soon as the proposed Independent Salary Review Commission has 
been established. 
  The democratic Government of Lesotho announced today that an 
Independent Salary Review Commission would be established to 
review the salary structure of all civil servants. A government 
spokesman said that this recommendation was proposed during 
negotiations between the Lesotho Government ministerial 
delegation and representatives of the police force over the past 
few days. The work of the proposed salary review commission 
will be carried out by professionals from outside the country. 
Toward this end the government will request assistance from the 
international donor community to help in the identification of 
such specialists and their assignment to Lesotho to undertake 
the work as soon as it is appropriate. It is understood that 
the work of mounting such a commission was of such complexity 
and magnitude that it could take from three to six months to 
accomplish. 
  The former minister of natural resources in the government 
of 
the Kingdom of Lesotho, Mr. Monyane Moleleki, has resigned. A 
government spokesman made the announcement this afternoon 
without giving reasons for the resignation. Mr. Moleleki's 
resignation from the cabinet was made while he lived outside the 
country.

  [Text] Talks on forming a coalition government in Malawi 
after the country's first democratic elections have collapsed. 
  The talks were held between the victorious Democratic Front, 
or UDF, of President Bakili Muluzi and the Alliance for 
Democracy, or Aford, led by Mr. Chakufwa Chihana. Interviewed 
in Blantyre, Aford's second president, Mr. Peter (Kaleso), said 
the UDF had failed to meet his party's demands. Mr. (Kaleso) 
said Aford had demanded that Mr. Chihana be appointed second 
vice president and, in addition, be in charge of either the 
foreign or home affairs ministries. Furthermore, Aford wanted 
seven ministerial portfolios including Justice, Works and 
Supplies, and Agriculture. 
  Aford, which won all 33 parliamentary seats in Malawi's 
northern region during last week's general elections, sought a 
coalition with UDF which won 84 of the 177 seats in Parliament. 
The Malawi Congress Party of defeated President Kamuzu Banda 
won 55 seats, but the UDF said it would not form a coalition 
with it.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] Talks have been continuing between the UDF [United 
Democratic Front] and Aford [Alliance for Democracy]. Aford won 
all the seats in northern Malawi, but trailed behind the UDF 
with 33 to the UDF's 84. They need an alliance to take on the 
old ruling MCP [Malawi Congress Party] which has 55 seats in the 
assembly. But there were reports that Aford was unhappy with the 
three junior ministries that had been offered by Bakili Muluzi. 
On the line to Malawi, Mary Harper asked Aford's Secretary 
General Dr. (Meke Mchewa) how the talks were going. 
  [Begin recording] [(Mchewa]) The talks are going very well, 
I 
should say, and that the invitation when offered to Aford for a 
discussion in Blantyre two days ago, at least, we -- Aford -- 
accepted those [as heard] in the goodwill and spirit in which 
they were intended. 
  [Harper] But things don't really seem to be going very well 
at all. You were offered three ministries by the UDF in the new 
government and you refused them? 
  [(Mchewa]) We have not said no to that. That is a position 
yet which has to be (?briefed) to our president and our 
president was only briefed yesterday by some members of the 
delegation, but not the entire team. 
  [Harper] So, what is it exactly that Aford wants? 
  [(Mchewa] No, I think the question must be what is it 
exactly 
that the UDF wants. I think that has been our question to them 
and they are unable to define it. 
  [Harper] What about the question of ministries? How many 
would you be satisfied with?

I don't think we can dictate the terms of [words indistinct] to 
them. That offer was made to us. We should be in a position to 
say whether or not indeed it does meet the minimum of a decent 
relationship to occur. 
  [Harper] Now, what has become of your party leader, Chakufwa 
Chihana? He seems to have completely disappeared? 
  [(Mchewa] Not at all. He is well and alive and doing 
absolutely well by [words indistinct] and doing at least the 
normal thing that he has missed doing as a family [words 
indistinct] productive man in these past few months. [end

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] As Malawians celebrate the birth of democracy, a 
debate is raging about the constitution of the new president's 
choice of ministers. It had been thought that President Bakili 
Muluzi, who leads the United Democratic Front [UDF], would have 
offered some important cabinet posts to Mr. Chakufwa Chihana's 
Aford [Alliance for Democracy] party who did not do as well as 
expected in the polls. But so far all the positions have gone 
only to Mr. Muluzi's UDF party, but the UDF did not secure a 
working majority in the elections. So, they will have to form a 
coalition and it had been widely anticipated that this will be 
with Aford. Mary Gregory asked Aford's secretary for legal and 
constitutional affairs, Mr. Bazuka Muhango, how the party felt 
about the cabinet appointments. 
  [Begin recording] [Muhango] It is very disappointing because 
the question about the seats we are talking about was something 
that was to arise after some negotiations for a coalition had 
been struck. We made certain demands, that is, the team from 
Aford made certain demands for a coalition participation. It 
looks like the UDF government was not interested in a coalition 
arrangement. They only wanted Aford to participate in 
government. 
  [Gregory] What demands did you make? 
  [Muhango] Well, we did make a demand of eight ministerial 
seats and we did make preferences taking into account, you know, 
the real effectiveness of participation in the coalition. 
  [Gregory] Negotiations between Aford and the UDF broke down 
on Tuesday [24 May]. So, what are you planning to do next? 
  [Muhango] We are assembling over the weekend -- I am talking 
about Aford now -- in order to reflect on the aftermath of this 
and a decision will be made when the assembly made up of elected 
members and the council members of Aford will have to assemble 
and deliberate on this matter. 
  [Gregory] There are still three seats vacant in the cabinet 
that haven't been allocated to anybody. So, if you are offered 
those three seats, will you accept them and will you be happy 
with just those three? 
  [Muhango] Well, I cannot decide for the council meeting, but 
obviously if you look at the ministries that are (?to be) 
filled, they are [words indistinct] type of ministries with very 
little consequences on governmental performance, and we think 
that it's really a joke that [words indistinct] reserving them 
in order to offer them to Aford. It can only show that they 
were not seriously [words indistinct] in any coalition 
arrangement with Aford. It would depend on what the council 
decides, but my personal feeling is that perhaps Aford would not 
really enter on an arrangement on the basis of that offer. 
  [Gregory] So, what solution do you see to this problem? 
  [Muhango] Well, our view was that given the results of the 
election the matter would have been resolved by actually getting 
consultations with all the parties that took part in the 
election and had some positive results because the split in the 
vote is such that you really can go across the country and see 
that each of the major parties have won in one of the regions. 
So, to avoid the fragmentation of the country, our view is that 
maybe we should proceed on the basis that we are to reconcile 
the different sections and regions of the country. Malawi 
requires to have a kind of a government of national unity, at 
least for some period. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Sam Nujoma by Veronique Kiesel in </F>
Brussels; date not given: "On Namibia and the President's Visit 
to Belgium"] 
  [Text] [Kiesel] Four years ago, Namibia gained independence 
and, after winning the elections, you became its first 
president. What has changed in your country since then? 
  [Nujoma] The Namibians are free, masters of their fate. They 
make their own decisions, through the process of parliamentary 
democracy. Human rights are respected, as is press freedom and 
freedom of speech, which are protected by law. Before that, 
people were separated according to their color, their ethnic 
origin. Today, Namibian children go to school together, all are 
citizens of the same country. We have striven to establish 
peace and stability, which are vital to economic development. 
  [Kiesel] Your government program includes an agrarian 
reform, 
the redistribution of land to peasants who were deprived of it. 
Is this reform not likely to disrupt the good relations which 
you have succeeded in maintaining with the white minority in 
your country? 
  [Nujoma] Namibia was colonized first by the Germans, and 80 
percent of arable land is in the hands of the Whites. Now that 
apartheid no longer exists, and that all Namibians are equal 
citizens, we need land for some people, but we believe in the 
virtues of dialogue. The land problem was discussed at the 1991 
National Conference, with all the interlocutors, including the 
Whites. A technical committee then sent a report to the 
government and to Parliament. Of course, there are some Whites 
who do not want to share, who support the status quo, but the 
Constitution guarantees everybody's rights, and we want to 
ensure that every Namibian can own land. This is a big country, 
and there is a political will to achieve justice and a decent 
life for all. I therefore think we will manage to overcome this 
problem. 
  [Kiesel] Your big South African neighbor has just changed 
its 
face with Nelson Mandela's victory. What wishes do you have for 
the new South Africa and what are your hopes for Namibia and the 
rest of the region? 
  [Nujoma] As citizens, we welcome the new democratic and 
nonracial South Africa. We hope that there will be no more 
explosions of violence as there were before the elections, but 
that instead all South Africans will set to work for the common 
good. 
  As for our relations with our big neighbor, we hope that by 
joining the various regional organizations, and with its high 
economic standard, it will contribute to the welfare of the 
whole of southern Africa, and even the whole continent. At 
present, our economy is highly dependent on South Africa's 
economy, because of our historical ties. I think that this can 
be used in a positive way, now that apartheid is a thing of the 
past. Together we can be stronger faced with competition from 
the rest of the world. Let us follow the example of the 
European Union (EU), we should succeed in creating an African 
economic community. 
  [Kiesel] Just a few years ago, you were regarded as a 
Marxist 
guerrilla and now you are developing a free trade economic 
policy. How do you explain this change? 
  [Nujoma] I have been called all kinds of names: I was a 
terrorist, a Communist. In fact, I was primarily a Namibian, a 
member of the international community, who was fighting for his 
country's independence against the occupying forces. Today, our 
enemies have changed: They are called poverty, ignorance, and 
disease, and we must fight them. Our country has many 
resources: Uranium, copper, gold, and other metals, but we need 
education to be able to really exploit this wealth. That is why 
we opened a university last year, and why we are building many 
schools and hospitals. This improvement in our society is vital. 
  [Kiesel] Since the beginning of last year, the port of 
Walvis Bay, which was always occupied by South Africa, has been 
returned to Namibia. What are your plans on this subject? 
  [Nujoma] As you know, Namibia occupies a strategic position 
in this part of Africa. It provides access to the ocean for 
enclaved countries like Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Botswana, 
especially in view of the fact that we are working on big 
highways, like the trans-Kalahari Highway. Walvis Bay is 
already one of the most efficient ports in the whole of Africa, 
and, by railroad, it is even linked with Kenya. The more 
transport routes there are, the more we will be able to develop 
trade and business, inside the continent itself. 
  [Kiesel] With regard to the development of the port, you are 
in contact with Antwerp. 
  [Nujoma] Indeed, we went to visit the port of Antwerp on 
Wednesday morning [18 May] and we have been very impressed by 
the organization of labor. Moreover, we are very interested in 
an agreement which would enable us to improve the training of 
Namibians in this sphere. The Belgian Government has promised 
us the necessary funds for a training program of this kind. 
  [Kiesel] Aside from this cooperation agreement, what are the 
aims of your visit to Belgium? 
  [Nujoma] Namibia is a product of the international 
community. 
My colleagues and I have all experienced exile, especially in 
Belgium, which is rather like our second home: Two SWAPO 
[South- west African People's Organization] conferences were 
held there in 1972 and 1986. From our early days, we were 
supported here in Belgium by antiapartheid organizations and by 
trade unions, then by the government. We have very good 
friends, and this visit is an opportunity to revive the 
excellent relations between our two countries. Just after our 
independence, to express our gratitude, I invited King Baudouin 
to Namibia. He accepted, but unfortunately did not have time to 
come to see us. Moreover, we came here with proposals for 
commercial agreements, and plans for joint-ventures between 
private enterprises. 
  [Kiesel] What about the European aspect of your visit to 
Brussels? 
  [Nujoma] From before we gained our independence, the 
European 
Community gave us its support, and it continued afterwards, 
especially through aid for training. The EU therefore plays a 
vital role with regard to us, and we want to continue these 
relations in the most beneficial way.

  [Text] President Nelson Mandela has repeated his offer to 
minority parties to include their members in public service and 
diplomatic posts. Mr. Mandela first made the offer in his 
election victory speech. During talks in Cape Town with PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] President Clarence Makwetu he asked 
for the names of PAC officials who could fill government posts. 
Members of the NP [National Party], the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] and the DP [Democratic Party] are also being considered 
for government posts. Earlier it was announced that 6,000 APLA 
[Azanian People's Liberation Army] members were to be included 
in the SANDF [South African National Defense Force], although 
the PAC had ignored the deadline for inclusion.

  [Text] National Assembly May 25 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP) was committed to the Reconstruction and Development 
Programme [RDP], but it should be carried out at provincial and 
local government level, IFP leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi 
said on Wednesday. 
  Speaking in the debate on the president's opening speech he 
congratulated him and those leaders who preceded him "in your 
struggle to have brought us here today." 
  He lamented the fact that KwaZulu/Natal had to go to the 
elections in -- and remained in -- a state of emergency. "It is 
the only fly in the ointment of the overflowing cup of joy which 
is before us." 
  The government of national unity faced a challenge of 
titanic 
proportions, not only to succeed, but to make the Reconstruction 
and Development Programme actually work for the people. "We in 
the IFP are committed to do what we can," he said. The IFP 
accepted the challenge, but gave notice that it would bring into 
play the wide variety of the country's diverse community. "We 
must ensure that all political parties will continue to play an 
active role in supporting the RDP effort through to its final 
implementation." 
  Hidden political agendas had to be avoided, Mr Buthelezi 
said. 
  Though he found Mr Mandela's vision for a new South Africa 
and the RDP proposals commendable, there might be differences of 
approach on detail between their two parties. "We should not 
have a top-down programme. The people must be empowered to 
develop and implement programmes for their own communities, 
entrusting the execution to grass roots level." 
  All chapters of the RDP falling under the functional areas 
of 
the provincial authorities should be developed autonomously by 
the provinces, while the central government was restricted to 
receiving and co-ordinating such programmes. "Let us have the 
true courage of empowering people at local and provincial 
government levels. It is only with this approach that we will 
carry into the programme the rich diversity of our people," Mr 
Buthelezi said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Home Affairs Minister Dr. Mangosuthu </F>
Buthelezi by SABC correspondent Denzil Taylor; place and date 
not given; on the "Newsbrief" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Buthelezi] It's a very historic thing which I 
thought I wouldn't see in my lifetime, so from that point of 
view I think it's a very emotional thing, that we are opening 
Parliament -- and that we are in Parliament with a black 
president as the head of state. 
  [Taylor] And your role within the Parliament? How do you see 
that? 
  [Buthelezi] That is going to be very difficult, because as a 
student of constitutional law I know that there is joint 
responsibility in cabinet and in this case, of course, it is the 
constitution which decrees that: This is the vote I got then we 
have so many portfolios in cabinet -- so then, of course we have 
different parties, actually, I mean the National Party, IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC -- have different policies, 
but of course on the Reconstruction and Development -- I mean, 
we have no problems with that because on the face of it there is 
nothing wrong. I think every government would like to do all 
those things for its people, so it's almost [word indistinct] 
really, since it's a question of the wherewithal, where the 
money's going to come from. 
  [Taylor] Are you happy with the amount of portfolios you 
got, 
and specifically yours? 
  [Buthelezi] I was not even keen to go into cabinet myself. 
In fact the caucus had to push me to go into it because of the 
problem I have just outlined to you. 
  [Taylor] Are you not happy with the number of portfolios you 
got? 
  [Buthelezi] No, I mean, I did not even expect...I did not 
even expect that. I have stated before elections that our 
(?part) is in opposition politics, but the constitution decrees 
otherwise. 
  [Taylor] And your role with President Nelson Mandela -- do 
you see that as a smooth one or a rough ride from here on? 
  [Buthelezi] Well, you know, Dr. Mandela and myself have been 
friends for nearly 60 years now and on the face of it we get on 
very well, as friends, as former colleagues, and so on, but of 
course our parties now and then are in conflict you see. For 
instance, I mean, the parties -- people down there may be more 
in conflict than he and I are in conflict. 
  [Taylor] There is the problem with the Natal-KwaZulu -- the 
ANC says that it is not happy with its portfolios that it's got 
or the amount of portfolios. It would have liked to have joint 
control over things like defense, police, and stuff like that. 
  [Buthelezi] Only one person can hold a portfolio for the 
services, you know, only one person and Dr. Mdlalose has decided 
to nominate such a person and I say, as I said yesterday, that 
inasmuch as the state president, Mr. Mandela, had offered me 
Health, but decided to...the following morning to take it away 
from me, I never ran to the press to complain about that because 
that wasn't my prerogative, so in the same way it is the 
prerogative of Dr. Mdlalose to nominate the members of cabinet.

<F P=106> [By political correspondent Pierre Claassen] </F>
  [Text] National Assembly May 26 SAPA -- The first political 
blows between the ANC and NP [National Party] partners in the 
new government of national unity were exchanged on Thursday, 
leaving members booing and hissing at the podium. Speaking from 
it, and attacking ANC Housing Minister Mr Joe Slovo, was the 
National Party's Mr Piet Coetzer -- called "a National Party hit 
man" by a subsequent speaker. 
  Mr Coetzer started off by commenting on what he called a 
"honeymoon debate" filed with non-confrontational maiden 
speeches. An air of unreality prevailed while the tough debate 
lay ahead, he predicted. 
  He then turned on Mr Slovo as having broken with tradition 
in 
his maiden speech and said: 
  "If you don't behave like a maiden, don't expect to be 
treated as one." 
  Mr Slovo, he said, had attacked Deputy President F W de 
Klerk 
(his party leader) for distorting the past about the delivery 
and payment of services. "There is a gap between his (Mr 
Slovo's) interpretation and the truth of the past," Mr Coetzer 
said. 
  Mr Coetzer then quoted statistics of serviced sites 
delivered 
by the Transvaal Provincial Administration. It far exceeded the 
25,000 units a year Mr Slovo had referred to, he said. 
  Furthermore, if Mr Slovo wanted to apportion blame, he 
himself would have to admit to the ANC's share or his dreams for 
housing would blow up in his face. "While local authorities were 
trying, the ANC was promoting a policy of making the country 
ungovernable. It must now accept responsibility for boycotts and 
non-payment of services," he said. 
  Despite an agreement between Mr de Klerk and President 
Nelson 
Mandela in January this year that the rent boycott would stop, 
income from services had continued to drop to a national average 
of 20 percent. In Soweto it was far below 10 percent. The 
monthly income there was R[Rand]900,000 whereas the annual water 
bill alone was R4 million. 
  In central Witwatersrand alone R400 million of regional 
services council funds had been spent on running costs instead 
of the infrastructural expenditure it was intended for. 
  "If this culture is not reversed, you will not succeed in 
realising this (housing) dream," Mr Coetzer said. 
  He wanted to plead with the state president not to try and 
convert the country into a welfare state, but rather to create 
conditions under which people could improve their own 
circumstances. 
  As Mr Coetzer finished many boo's and hisses came from ANC 
members. 
  Next speaker was ANC member Mr Jannie Momberg -- like Mr 
Coetzer a carry-over from the previous Parliament. He said he 
wanted to inform his new colleagues that in the past, when the 
National Party was in trouble, "they used to send in Piet 
Coetzer as their hit man". 
  "At this stage, I did not think the NP was in trouble," he 
remarked, to mirth. 
  He reminded the assembly that today, May 26, was the 
anniversary of the National Party takeover of power in 1948. 
  "On that day a few hundred thousand people gained their 
freedom from English dominance at the cost of 40 million (sic)." 
  Now 40 million people had gained their freedom at the cost 
of 
no-one.

  [Text] National Assembly May 26 SAPA -- Regardless of the 
political baggage all politicians carried, he was proud to say 
he had been liberated by South Africa's transition to a full 
democracy, the minister of environment affairs and tourism, Dr 
Dawie de Villiers, said on Thursday. Speaking during debate on 
the president's state of the nation address, he said the victory 
achieved had not just been that of any one party, "but a victory 
we can all share -- of freedom, democracy and justice". 
  South Africans should not under-estimate the enormous 
challenges facing the country. 
  Dr de Villiers warned of a "very difficult future" if "we 
fail to make peace with our past". He pledged the new National 
Party's [NP] commitment to the new dispensation and said the 
party would make its contribution to the writing of South 
Africa's final constitution which should not have the 
deficiencies of the interim one. 
  He drew further applause from ANC benches when he said 
although the NP and ANC had differed on a number of issues, if 
the two parties had not driven the negotiation process together 
South Africa would not have reached the stage it had. Other 
parties, such as the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Freedom Front 
and the Democratic Party, had also made important contributions. 
  Many Afrikaners had sought escape in the dream of a white 
homeland, but many conservatives now realised they had to come 
to terms with reality. 
  Three particularly important areas to which President Nelson 
Mandela had committed his government were financial discipline, 
confidence in markets, and the role of the private sector in 
securing a sustainable economy and the opening of the economy to 
global competition. These commitments would inspire confidence 
in the business community locally and internationally. 
  Although difficult times lay ahead, and painful decisions 
needed to be taken, the NP would co-operate fully to make the 
government of national unity work.

  [Text] National Assembly May 27 SAPA -- While there would 
be no Nuremburg trial, revenge or witch-hunt of those who 
committed human rights violations in the past, he wished to give 
the assurance that there would be no cover-up or sweeping under 
the carpet, the minister of justice, Mr Dullah Omar, said on 
Friday. Speaking during debate on the president's state of the 
nation address, he said: "There will be no amnesty without 
disclosure." (applause) It had to be made possible for all 
South Africans to come to terms with the past with dignity. 
  The Constitution laid down certain conditions for amnesty 
for 
the period from October 1990 to October 6, 1993, and the last 
official cut-off date mentioned had been December 5, 1993. The 
post-December 6 period was not covered by draft legislation now 
being prepared, Mr Omar said. 
  A proposed commission of truth and reconciliation should 
avoid any connotation which suggested revenge or a witch-hunt. 
Amnesty should be accompanied by acknowledgement and 
disclosure. Ordinary crimes will not be covered, and victims 
should receive reparation and compensation. 
  Mr Omar said the views of all parties represented in the 
government of national unity would be taken into account in the 
process, as well as those of parties not represented. 
  The ANC's opposition on the death penalty remained and 
legislation would be presented in due course. In the meantime, 
the moratorium on the death sentence would remain. Mr Omar said 
he spent sleepless nights thinking about the 400 people sitting 
on death row in South Africa (including the former 
self-governing territories), and this matter would have to be 
dealt with "expeditiously". 
  Just so would the question of children in prison. This 
problem was compounded by many children not having homes or 
parents to go to, and by the fact that many juveniles had been 
convicted of extremely serious crimes of violence. "I cannot 
see them being released to places where similar crimes could be 
committed," Mr Omar said. Violence against women also had to be 
addressed. He concluded: "Much work needs to be done to ensure 
that justice becomes truly accessible to all our people." 
  At the start of his speech, Mr Omar said he shared the joy 
of 
others at the "scourge of apartheid" having been removed from 
South Africa's society. But, he warned, "we should not be 
carried away by the euphoria of the moment." His one great 
apprehension was that in five years' time someone might write 
about the country: "not yet uhuru [Swahili for freedom]." For 
this reason, the reconstruction and development programme had to 
succeed.

  [Text] National Assembly May 27 SAPA -- South Africa could 
not afford to be inward looking or isolated in an age of rapid 
global communications, the minister of foreign affairs, Mr 
Alfred Nzo, said on Friday. Speaking in debate on the 
president's speech, Mr Nzo said South Africa should strive to 
live in harmony with its neighbours and should conduct a foreign 
policy aimed at the promotion of the well-being of all its 
people. "As an African country with a rich international 
heritage, we should promote Africa's interests, not only its 
immediate economic and social needs, but also the continent's 
long-term wellbeing in all spheres." 
  South Africa's foreign policy would be guided by the 
promotion of freedom and democracy and commitments to human 
rights, the principles of justice, to the interests of Africa, 
and to expanded regional and international economic 
co-operation. South Africa would seek to promote unity among 
all the peoples of Africa. 
  South Africa's first step in realising the ideal of African 
unity was its acceptance as the 53rd member of the Organisation 
of African Unity. "Africa has taken us to her bosom with 
overwhelming warmth and friendship. We are now part of Africa." 
  A regional security mechanism was important to deal with 
regional conflicts.

  [Text] Senate May 27 SAPA -- South Africa had finally put 
all political conflict behind it, President Nelson Mandela 
assured the chamber Friday. Replying to debate on his opening 
address he said the past four days had been the most exciting in 
the country's political life. "For the first time we have put 
all political conflict behind us," he said. The government of 
national unity had created the visible and tangible guarantee 
that there could be no chance for oppression or radical policies. 
  Recalling the process of negotiations started with his first 
contact with the senate president and former minister of 
justice, Mr Kobie Coetsee, he also extended credit for the 
change to dialogue to a previous state president, Mr P W Botha. 
He recalled his first meeting with him where he had been 
received with dignity and respect. He met him again six months 
ago when he was again received with the same welcome, warmth and 
respect. "He telephoned me two days ago, not only to 
congratulate me on the inauguration, but on the work that has 
been done since then." 
  In his early discussions with Mr Botha in March 1989 on the 
issues of violence, majority rule and reconciliation, he had 
said that the acid test for a future government and the ANC was 
to assure whites that majority rule -- not black majority rule 
-- would not lead to black oppression of whites. Furthermore, 
there had to be tangible and visible structures that guaranteed 
it. "We now have that structured guarantee," Mr Mandela said. 
  The government of national unity had brought together a 
variety of political parties, making it impossible to implement 
radical policies. It compelled the government to develop a 
culture of consultation, to learn the lesson as fellow South 
Africans bound together by a common loyalty that men and women 
should see the issues that united them rather than those that 
divided. "The last four days have been the most exciting, the 
most unforgettable in our political life." 
  The electorate had clearly made the right choice and he was 
proud to work with the men and women who constituted the new 
government. "Whoever started the process is of little 
relevance," Mr Mandela said. "What has been achieved has been 
the product of us all." 
  In the past few days he had met the leaders of the so-called 
radical left and right. "I can assure you the spirit of these 
discussions have been most harmonious. I would lean backwards, 
go on my knees, for peace in our country." 
  Nobody should fear peace or democracy. It was the 
correctness of the position from which one took decisions, 
careful thought and the support of strong and independent men 
and women which in all probability warranted the taking of 
correct decisions.

  [Text] Senate May 27 SAPA -- Discussions with rightwing 
leaders had shown that there could no longer be talk about 
extreme right- and leftwing radicals -- because they 
complemented each other, president Mr Nelson Mandela said on 
Friday. Replying to debate in the Senate on his opening address 
to parliament, he said: "We are now coming together, 
complementing one another in a stimulating environment. When I 
think about the future of our country, I do so with the 
realisation...all South Africans, black and white, are now 
united in the enlightening job of building a new country." 
  Mr Mandela said leaders would have to counter many attacks 
and criticism, some of which was justified. However, "we must 
concentrate on nation-building, stress those issues which unite 
us". 
  He said that when listening to debate in parliament, he had 
been left with no doubt that the country had started a new era. 
"We have reached the stage where we look at each other as 
fellow South Africans." There had been fights in the past, but 
it had to be buried and past wounds healed. 
  The majority of Africans coloureds and Indians had not had 
the same education opportunities as whites. "You (whites) now 
have knowledge skills and expertise. We cannot build this 
country without that knowledge, skills and expertise. We want 
you to take leadership in the new South Africa. "Your future is 
secure, you can no longer...fear democracy."

  [Text] National Assembly May 27 SAPA -- Admonitions on the 
dangers of the ANC abusing its majority to stifle and swamp 
smaller parties were grossly misplaced, President Nelson Mandela 
said on Friday. 
  Wrapping up the historic debate on his opening speech to 
South Africa's first democratically elected Parliament, Mr 
Mandela paid tribute to the central role played by the people 
and their many organisations in gaining democracy. 
  Quoting the Freedom Charter, Mr Mandela traced the struggle 
for democracy. "Today, all the members of the house, no matter 
which party you belong to, are here in the full knowledge that 
you are the legitimate representative of the will of the 
people," he said. 
  The ANC had resisted undemocratic attempts to shackle 
majority rule. "The plan for a government of democratic unity 
we put forward -- and which is now operative -- is inclusive and 
democratic," he said. 
  The ANC had expanded its primary Cosatu [Congress of South 
African Trade Unions]/SACP [South African Communist Party] 
alliance to include the patriotic front, with its commitment to 
inclusivity for the sake of nation-building finding its latest 
expression in the government of national unity. "Admonitions 
directed at our address about the dangers of a majority party 
abusing its majority to stifle and swamp smaller parties are, 
therefore, grossly misplaced. Our record in this regard should 
certainly speak for itself." 
  "We are not expecting uncritical adulation and applause." 
  The people's confidence in the future should not however be 
undermined by constant insinuations that the ANC was indifferent 
to the concerns of political minorities when it had consistently 
demonstrated how seriously those concerns were taken. "Our 
objective is to continue operating in this balanced way, true to 
the precept of the Freedom Charter that all national groups 
shall have equal rights, the overriding obligation of course 
being to meet the needs and improve the lives of the suffering 
people." 
  He was encouraged that this was generally agreed to by all 
parties. 
  He said there had been moving moments in the debate as 
speakers responded to the exciting, inspirational and liberating 
possibilities and realities of new-found South Africanness. 
"Listening to our Afrikaner compatriots in this house hailing 
the dawn of the new democratic South Africa as an event of 
liberation for themselves rather than an experience of loss; 
hearing the honourable leader of the Freedom Front (General 
Constand Viljoen) publicly acknowledging and paying tribute to 
the demonstrated desire of the majority party to create an 
inclusive nation where there is place for all -- these were some 
of the moments which captured the new spirit abroad in our land." 
  These responses had demonstrated an encouraging generosity 
of 
spirit, reciprocating the generosity abundantly displayed by the 
oppressed and suffering people who had mandated their leaders to 
negotiate a future of peace, forgiveness and inclusivity.

  [Excerpts] Last night the Security Council debated whether 
or not to lift the arms embargo that's been in force against 
this country for so long. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki was 
there to address the council and the message he brought was that 
South Africa intended being a good citizen of the world. The 
debate evoked considerable comment and overran its scheduled 
time by more than two hours. We now we have some excerpts from 
the proceedings. [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Mbeki recording] We therefore view the decisions that 
the council will take today as an acceptance by the world body 
that we have become a democratic country, and a country that can 
be counted on to subscribe and adhere to the pursuits of the 
important goals of international peace and security. Like 
millions of other people across the globe, we count on this body 
to continue to act as a principal protagonist in the global 
struggle for peace, security, and stability. We firmly commit 
our country, Mr. President, as a member of the United Nations 
and as a responsible citizen of the world, to live up to its 
obligations in this regard and consequently to contribute what 
it can to the making of the peaceful world, which is the right 
of the people. Our government and people are determined to 
ensure that within our borders we banish from our national life 
all those things that make for war and violent conflict. 
  The successful transition to a democratic order constitutes 
the firm foundation for peace which our people have yearned for, 
for generations. It constitutes also the basis from which we 
will move in the search for a negotiated, just, and stable 
regional security system for all the peoples of southern Africa, 
which would guarantee the sovereignty of all the countries of 
our region and ensure that never again should any country fall 
victim to aggression and destabilization. Our country has also 
begun discussions to see what further contribution we can make 
to the search for peace in Angola and Mozambique, in support of 
the efforts of the United Nations, and the governments and 
peoples of these two countries. We are also committed, Mr. 
President, to participate to the full extent of our abilities in 
the efforts spearheaded by the OAU to address the related issues 
of peace, security, stability, cooperation, and development on 
our continent. We are accordingly ready to begin discussions 
with the OAU, the UN, and all concerned with regard to what can 
and should be done concerning the tragic situation in Rwanda. 
[passage omitted] 
  I thought it might be appropriate, Mr. President, without 
taking too much time of the council, to express our -- our 
thanks for the statements that members of council, and members 
of the United Nations generally, for the statements that they 
have made today -- for the salute they have made to our 
President Nelson Mandela, to Deputy President De Klerk, and our 
people generally, for the manner in which they have conducted 
the process of transition in South Africa and to say, Mr. 
President, we shall surely convey to our leadership and our 
people the sentiments expressed by this council, members of the 
United Nations, and to say we appreciate very much the fact of 
the unanimous decision by this council. I'm grateful, Mr. 
President, that you make reference to the extent to which our 
continent is over-armed, and indeed we thought we needed to 
indicate in our own intervention that it certainly was not our 
intention to play a role on the African continent, given South 
Africa's capacity with regards to armaments production. It 
certainly was not our intention to exploit the decision that the 
council took today, to worsen a situation on the African 
continent which does not need worsening, but needs improving.

  [Text] Cape Town May 26 SAPA -- Although the issue of the 
defence industry raised moral and political questions, in 
reality it could contribute significantly to reconstruction and 
development, Minister of Defence Mr Joe Modise said on Thursday. 
In a statement welcoming the lifting of the United Nations arms 
embargo on South Africa, he said the industry had become one of 
South Africa's largest exporters of manufactured goods. 
  "Should South Africa's present 0.4 percent share in the 
world 
armaments market be increased to only one percent, this will 
result in 20,000 new job opportunities." 
  There need be no fear that arms and equipment would fall 
into 
the wrong hands. The trade had to be conducted in a responsible 
and accountable manner. 
  Mr Modise said he was delighted that the embargo belonged to 
the past. This development had far-reaching and constructive 
implications for South Africa and the region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Safety and Security Sydney </F>
Mufamadi by Leslie Mashokwe in the SABC's Cape Town studio, on 
the "Newsline" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] Mr. Mufamadi, good evening and welcome. 
  [Mufamadi] Good evening, Leslie. 
  [Mashokwe] From being harassed, jailed, and being detained 
by 
the police -- to chief of the police -- how is that 
transformation? 
  [Mufamadi] Leslie, I am not chief of the police; I'm 
Minister 
of Safety and Security? 
  [Mashokwe] Political master of the police force? 
  [Mufamadi] Okay, well, what you are referring to are things 
that happened in the past. It was in a context where the police 
were enforcing the law. The law happened to have been 
unpopular. We now have a government of national unity whose 
existence reflects the will of the masses of our people in the 
country and therefore is going to bring about popular laws which 
will need to be enforced. 
  [Mashokwe] That transformation, how does it touch your 
heart? 
Does it mean anything to you? Is it just a transformation? 
  [Mufamadi] Well, it's not a question of heart. It's a 
question of us having agreed that we need to resolve all the 
problems which we had in this country, through peaceful means, 
and I think we have reached a stage now where we all have to 
confirm our commitment to a new South Africa, a South Africa 
which is going to be at peace with itself, and there is a role 
for the police in the shaping up of that South Africa. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Minister, what we have witnessed here is a 
change of political masters. The police force then enforced the 
laws of the day, the National Party laws that you say were 
unpopular. Are they still going to continue to be servants of 
the political masters? 
  [Mufamadi] Well, the constitution lays down standards 
according to which policing is going to take place. Policemen 
and women are expected to be professional in their outlook. 
They are expected to be inspired and motivated by the ethic of 
serving the nation, of serving the community. They are expected 
to be professional. Now, all this will be done as part of 
upholding the constitution of the land, and it means, therefore, 
because these standards, these provisions, are laid down in the 
Constitution, policemen and women are no longer going to be 
abused by political parties. 
  [Mashokwe] How do you demarcate the boundaries? When are 
they going to be professional, or are they going... [brief break 
in transmission] 
  [Mufamadi] Well, I think what we have established is a 
commitment to change, a commitment to be part of the process of 
change and ensuring that they as policemen and women are not 
going to be victims of this process of change, which means that 
from the beginning, processes of consultation are going to be 
put into motion. That will include what the Constitution refers 
to as police community forums, and this professionalization that 
we are talking about, in essence it means being responsive to 
the needs and requirements that are articulated by the 
community. The community should be able to set policing 
priorities. The community, through its elected representatives 
who would be serving in those forums, should be able to say: We 
are the consumers of this service, and therefore this is the 
sort of quality of service we are demanding. 
  [Mashokwe] What about the scourge of the ISD [Internal 
Stability Division]? What the ANC then said was that they were 
bad policemen. What is going to happen to them? And add to 
that the fact that we want to know whether we are still going to 
have security forces, intelligence people like the FBI's and 
CIA's? 
  [Mufamadi] Well I think we need to put it this way -- that 
the Internal Stability Division was charged with the 
responsibility of public order policing. The new government of 
national unity thinks that there was a lot wrong in the way they 
were trained -- there was this militaristic culture which 
obtained within the ISU [Internal Stability Unit] -- which lent 
itself to excessive use of force, which needs to be changed. 
That does not take away the need for public order policing, but 
it means that they need to be trained differently. They have to 
continue to maintain law and order, to do public order policing, 
but in a manner which conforms to the standards that I have 
referred to earlier -- impartiality, service orientated and, 
therefore, user friendly. 
  [Mashokwe] Intelligence? 
  [Mufamadi] Well it depends on what you mean by intelligence 
-- I guess a good detective? 
  [Mashokwe] No, no, the type of thing we had in the past, Mr. 
Mufamadi, where people would be woken up at night, the telephone 
being tapped and.... 
  [Mufamadi, interrupting] Well, waking people at night is not 
called intelligence, but basically intelligence means if I'm 
investigating a case I must be able to gather all the relevant 
information which will lead to me making sure that justice takes 
its course. It means that I must be able to say this is a 
suspect, he or she must be tried in a open court of law, and the 
court will make its own finding. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay, let's talk about demilitarization and 
professionalization of the SAPS [South African Police Service]: 
Changing name ranks from lieutenant to some new name does not 
change anything in actual fact. Why concentrate on name 
changing? 
  [Mufamadi] Now I'm saying -- you see this ranking system 
that 
exists now --- it's a military ranking system -- general so and 
so, colonel so and so, and brigadier so and so, and so on. It 
is necessary for us to look for appropriate ranking systems for 
the police, and it's not as if they don't exist. They are 
there, but leaving aside the question of ranking, when we talk 
about demilitarization we are saying essentially that there is a 
need for consultation and accountability, both within the South 
African Police Service as well as between the South African 
Police Service and the community at large. Now this 
militaristic culture we are referring to was a top-bottom 
approach, an approach which says: Because you are my 
subordinate, we think the police force...[pauses] Within the 
police service you cannot come up with creative ideas which are 
going to be taken on board in order to enrich policing in the 
country. We think that must go. We don't want unquestioning 
loyalty. We want loyalty which is based on people feeling that 
they are part of the system because there are channels of 
communication which allowed them to make a constructive input. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Mufamadi, thanks for your time and for 
talking 
to us.

  [Text] Durban May 26 SAPA -- The joint working group 
established to break the impasse over the allocation of 
ministerial portfolios in KwaZulu/Natal began its first meeting 
in Durban on Thursday. "We are here to look for solutions, 
otherwise I wouldn't be here," said the leader of the African 
National Congress delegation Jacob Zuma. 
  He declined to pre-empt the meeting's outcome, saying it was 
merely one of many possible meetings, and that it might take 
some time before a final solution was reached. 
  The joint working group was established on Tuesday by 
KwaZulu/Natal Premier Frank Mdlalose to resolve outstanding 
differences in the provincial legislature. 
  Disputes surfaced last week over the allocation of 
ministerial portfolios to the three ANC MECs [member Executive 
Committee], S'bu Ndebele, Zweli Mkhize and Mr Zuma. 
  The re-allocation of portfolios is believed to be the main 
issue on the agenda.

  [Text] The cabinet committee investigating the implication 
of the KwaZulu land issue says it hopes to submit its report and 
recommendations to the cabinet by the 14th of next month. 
  The minister of land affairs, Mr. Derek Hanekom, said 
experts 
had been appointed to assist the committee. He said that over 
three million hectares of the former homeland had been 
transferred to the control of the Zulu king. The transfer of 
the land took place just before the election without any media 
coverage.

  [Text] Cape Town May 26 SAPA -- Draft legislation to pave 
the way for the establishment of the Constitutional Court and 
the Human Rights Commission was approved by cabinet this week, a 
spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said on Thursday. He said 
four bills had been submitted to the state law advisers for 
vetting. 
  The measures would: 
  -- establish the Judicial Services Commission, the body that 
would present the president with a list of ten nominees for the 
Constitutional Court, and set out the framework of the court; 
  -- amend legislation on remuneration and service conditions 
of judges to bring the Constitutional Court judges into the net; 
  -- establish the Office of Public Protector, as provided by 
the Constitution; and 
  -- set out how the Human Rights Commission would operate and 
make the appointment of the commissioners possible. 
  The spokesman said the bills were presented to cabinet by 
minister of justice Mr Dullah Omar, who regarded them as "of the 
utmost importance". He said he was unable to speculate when 
Parliament would deal with the measures. "Hopefully they will 
be able to fit it in fairly soon," he said. 
  Members of the Parliamentary Secretariat said on Thursday 
morning that none of the standing committees that discuss 
legislation before it comes up for full debate had been named. 
They could not say when the committees were likely to sit on 
the justice department legislation, or on a number of other 
bills believed to be in the pipeline, including some 
constitutional amendments, police measures and "one or two 
education things". "We're just as much in the dark as everyone 
else," said a staffer. The committees would be able to discuss 
the legislation as soon as it was tabled.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 25 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] 
on Wednesday said the "lunatic left" was just as dangerous as 
the "lunatic right". The NP's Daryl Swanepoel was reacting to a 
recent statement by the Azanian Students Movement [Azasm] and 
threats made by the movement against white teachers in black 
schools. 
  Azasm said earlier in the week threatened the lives and 
safety of white teachers, saying blacks would "re-enact June 16 
[student uprising in Soweto] and fight with our bare hands". 
[sentence as received] 
  Mr Swanepoel, a member of the provincial legislature and 
party spokesman for the Johannesburg and Soweto region, said the 
NP strongly condemned the racist statements of Azasm National 
Deputy President Kgomotso Modiselle. "Sentiments such as those 
expressed by Azasm are totally against the will of the people. 
They are a return to the dark days we all thought were behind 
us," said Mr Swanepoel. He said it was sad to see there were 
still people in South Africa who were prepared to sacrifice the 
futures of young South Africans to fanatical political 
ideologies. "The NP trusts the government will respond to these 
threats and destroy the seeds of intimidation and 
destabilisation before they take root. We all thought that the 
only bits of racism left in our country were on the lunatic 
right. Now we find there is a lunatic fringe on the left as 
well and it is just as dangerous."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Mandela's Overtures to White Community -- "Two weeks into 
his 
Government's term, [Mandela] seems to be bending over backwards 
to accommodate De Klerk and the NP [National Party] in a manner 
that has already antagonized many within the ANC in Parliament." 
So argues political correspondent Kaizer Nyatsumba in a 
commentary published in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27 
May on page 16. Mandela, the commentary continues, "is so firmly 
committed to allaying the fears -- perceived and real -- of 
whites and the business community that he is in danger of soon 
finding himself a captive of white South Africa." Nyatsumba 
cites as examples of Mandela's efforts to appeal to the white 
community his state of the nation address in which he "unveiled 
remarkably moderate plans" and Mandela's decision to appoint 
Leon Wessels as deputy chairman of the Constitutional Assembly 
despite the ANC parliamentary caucus decision to nominate 
Bridgit Mabandla to the position. The commentary argues that 
there is now a need for "a voice to the left of the ANC...in 
Parliament to remind the new ANC-led government of its 
responsibility to the black masses." Nyatsumba concludes his 
commentary: "For Mandela's own sake, for the ANC's and indeed 
the whole country's we must hope our leaders will be able to 
combine reconcilatory moves with concrete steps, to send a 
message that the lot of blacks will not stay the same, and that 
some sacrifices by those who have been beneficiaries of 
apartheid in the past will have to be made." 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  KwaZulu Land Deal -- A brief editorial in the Johannesburg 
WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English on page 28 of its 27 May 
to 2 
June issue keeps alive the recent KwaZulu land transfer. The 
editorial says that while President Mandela, "master unifier 
that he is," might have been expected "to play down the 
seriousness" of the "secret land deal," no one else has "to fall 
in step." The paper sees the incident as "an early test of the 
way in which this country will work under the government of 
national unity. The government, without effective parliamentary 
opposition, will try and brush aside embarrassing conflicts 
and...encourage the media to go along with this." "We won't," 
promises the paper. 
<H8>  NEW NATION </H8>
  100-Day Reform Program Viewed -- "The minutes have started 
ticking by since President Nelson Mandela announced his 100-day 
reform programme in Parliament this week," begins the 
Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 27 May in a page 14 
editorial. We "welcome the President's approach in making the 
RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] a `people-driven' 
process." "This approach played a critical role in giving a 
voice to voters' needs and also shaped the programme of action 
which was pursued by their leaders. It would be tragic if we 
were to fail like the United States of America did during the 
presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when the privileged white 
community proved unwilling to share their material success with 
people of other races." The South African plan should succeed, 
however, because it "is aimed at unlocking the energies of the 
multitudes who were denied the opportunities given their white 
counterparts through the country's draconian apartheid laws." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Mandela's Parliamentary Address Viewed -- "A people-centered 
community -- this was the theme and refrain yesterday of 
President Nelson Mandela's opening address in Parliament," 
begins a page 12 editorial in Afrikaans in the Johannesburg 
BEELD on 25 May. "Freedom and human dignity formed the basis of 
the vision offered by Mr. Mandela, and the fact that he 
mentioned the word vision confirms that he is aware of his task 
-- that is, leading through inspiration. If the New South 
Africa accepts these ideals then a good future awaits the people 
of this country, and a people-centered community will be 
established. Each government must have a philosophy, but that 
alone will not create jobs or feed mouths. The real test will 
be in the program of action -- the practicality of the policies, 
the management, and the good leadership by government in 
realizing the above." "Our impression is that President 
Mandela's approach reflects a reasonable and sound policy." 
  Country's Admission to OAU `Positive'-- A second editorial 
on 
the same page notes that "South Africa's formal admission to the 
Organization of African Unity is the fulfillment of a dream. 
This will have a positive influence on the country itself, on 
southern Africa, as well as in the rest of Africa." "For as 
long as whites withheld equal rights from their fellow citizens 
this dream would have been impossible to realize. Africa was 
often placed in a serious dilemma because of South Africa. The 
advantages of technical and economic contact often overcame 
ideological aversion to the 'apartheid regime'. In addition to 
this Africa was often guilty of worse atrocities than those it 
accused the 'regime' of. Now that South Africa is allowed to 
fulfill its rightful role, South Africans should not expect too 
much, because Africa and the OAU carries very little weight 
globally. In befriending the rest of Africa, South Africa 
should not neglect its most valuable friend, the West."

  [Text] Brazzaville, 26 May (AFP) -- There is now a dispute 
between the Congolese ministries of interior and defense over 
the control of the gendarmerie, military sources announced today 
in Brazzaville. Dissolved in 1970 following the implication of 
several of its officers in a coup attempt against the late 
President Marien Ngouabi, the gendarmerie was reestablished in 
1992 with France's assistance and has about 2,000 men. It falls 
under the Ministry of Defense. The disagreement between the two 
ministries stems from Interior Minister Martin Mberi's wish to 
have the unit under his control, the same sources added. 
  This disagreement could compromise the French Government's 
support for the training of the gendarmerie units which will be 
strengthened with the future recruitment of more than 200 
24-year-olds, according to the same sources. 
  For his part, the French ambassador in Brazzaville, Raymond 
Cesaire, who was received yesterday by Mr. Mberi, reaffirmed on 
the official radio his country's willingness to contribute to 
the lasting restoration of security in Congo, in particular, 
through a support to the gendarmerie. "We want people to forget 
the difficult period the country has just passed through in 
order to achieve national reconciliation," Mr. Cesaire stated in 
a reference to the 1993 clashes between opposition and 
pro-government militiamen which left hundreds of people dead in 
Brazzaville. The diplomat also stressed that France supported 
recent bills on decentralization and general reorganization of 
the police force.
