  [Text] Guangzhou, May 2 (CNS)--Mayor of Guangzhou, Mr. Li 
Ziliu, told the press yesterday that real estate in the capital 
of Guangdong Province was developing in a healthy way and there 
was much room for foreign investment in this sector. Mr. Li 
said he hoped that foreign investors would not slow their pace 
of investment in this industry. 
  Mr. Li pointed out that the real estate market in the city 
last year, owing to the macro control and adjustment as well as 
the implementation of the value added tax, had seen a slump for 
a certain time, but its transactions had not suffered from a big 
fluctuation with the floor area of newly completed commodity 
housing for the year being put at 3.7 million square metres, 50 
percent up over the year before and that of its sales exceeding 
2 million square metres, earning RMB [Renminbi] 4.8 billion, 
over 60 percent up. 
  The mayor said that development of the real estate industry 
in the city last year was on the whole good and healthy and, 
being situated near Hong Kong and Macao, office buildings, 
factory buildings and residential blocks in Guangzhou all were 
in great demand and the city was considered a keen place for 
making investment in this industry by both domestic and foreign 
businessmen. In addition, with the raising of the living 
standard, residents' purchasing ability for residential property 
would also be enhanced, offering powerful support to the 
development of this industry. 
  Mr. Li pointed out that Guangzhou would develop into an 
international megalopolis within 15 years and its urban area 
would be enlarged by 2.7 times. The city would launch a number 
of construction projects including transformation of the old 
urban area, underground railways projects and residential 
building projects and legislation on the real estate industry in 
the city had been improving, creating good conditions for 
foreign investment in this sector there.

  [Text] In the hall of the provincial party committee 
building yesterday afternoon [27 April] the provincial party 
committee held a mobilization meeting on maintaining stability 
and striking severe blows at crime. In attendance were Du 
Qinglin; Wang Xueping; (Zhong Chen); Wei Zefang; (Li Mingxian); 
(Wu Fengnong); Tian Zhongmu, president of the provincial higher 
people's court; Qin Xingmin, chief procurator of the provincial 
procuratorate; and provincial department and bureau directors; 
secretaries of city and county party committees; mayors and 
county magistrates; and secretaries of commissions on politics 
and law. The meeting was presided over by Vice Governor Wang 
Xueping, member of the provincial party committee standing 
committee. Governor Du Qinglin [title as heard], deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee, made an important 
speech at the meeting. 
  Du Qinglin pointed out: Since the beginning of this year, 
party committees and governments at all levels in the province 
have achieved very great results in conscientiously implementing 
the basic policies set out by the party Central committee for 
the work of the whole party and nation, and in upholding the 
principle of doing two types of work simultaneously while 
attaching importance to both. Nevertheless, while the situation 
was fine, there still were factors affecting our province's 
political stability and social tranquility, the pubic security 
situation remained grim, and the incidence of major and [words 
indistinct] cases rose. The existence and spread of these 
destabilizing factors will affect and hinder the smooth progress 
of reform and opening up to the outside world, as well as 
economic construction. Therefore, party committees and 
governments at all levels should pay close attention to 
safeguarding stability as an important task at present; place it 
in an important position; uphold the strategic principle of 
doing two types of work simultaneously while attaching 
importance to both; and carry out the task of safeguarding 
stability and the struggle against various crimes, right down to 
the various aspects and strata of society, so as to develop a 
situation in which the whole party and society make joint 
efforts to manage social order and in which the broad masses of 
people take an active role in managing social order. Principal 
party and government leaders should take command personally, and 
party committees and governments at all levels should strengthen 
unified command and concentrate human, material, and financial 
resources, as we did in the case of severely cracking down on 
criminal activities in 1983; firmly implement the principle of 
punishing criminals sternly, promptly, and according to the law 
so as to destroy the criminals' overweening arrogance; implement 
the various measures for the comprehensive management of social 
order; uphold the principle of simultaneously solving and 
preventing crimes and taking both radical and stopgap measures, 
with the stress on the management of social order; and reduce or 
elimminate destabilizing factors and symptoms of law violations 
and crime once and for all.

  [Text] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, conducted investigation and study in Tianjin New 
Technology Industrial Park on 20 April and sponsored a forum 
with the responsible comrades of relevant districts and bureaus, 
in which he stressed: The days of bringing into full play the 
scientific and technological strong points in the municipality 
symbolize the occasion in which the municipality's economy is 
becoming prosperous. Various social circles across the 
municipality should firmly foster the thinking of science and 
technology being the primary productive force; unite as one; 
double their efforts; further accelerate the development of high 
and new technologies; and accelerate the transfer of high and 
new technological results, the industrialization of high and new 
technologies, and the construction of new-tech industrial parks 
and zones in the municipality so as to bring into full play the 
scientific and technological strong points of the municipality. 
  Participating in the investigation and study activities were 
Zheng Zhiying, member of the municipal party standing committee 
and secretary general of the municipal party committee, and 
responsible comrades from the districts of Nankai and Xiqing. 
  Gao Dezhan and his entourage first looked into the 
enterprises located in the new-tech industrial park, including 
Tianjin Land-Seabed Oil-Drilling Equipment and Technology 
Development Company, Wantong Electronic Machine Company, 
Dongfang Electronic Development Company, Xinxing Electronic 
Company, and Tianjin Jinke Electronic Corporation Ltd. They 
also went deep into the workshops of production and sale 
departments to learn about the situation in technology, 
equipment, and the contingent of staff members and workers. 
They also heard the briefing given by the responsible comrade 
of the municipal science and technology commission with regard 
to the situation prevailing in the municipal new-tech industrial 
park. 
  The present scope and high and new technologies of the 
municipal new-tech industrial park have achieved rapid 
development under the correct leadership of the municipal party 
committee and the municipal people's government and thanks to 
the support given by the State Science and Technology Commission 
and various social circles. At the end of March this year, the 
number of enterprises in the new- tech industrial park reached 
1,140, which accommodated 30,000 employees. Total income earned 
by the enterprises of technology, industry, and trade in the 
park in 1993 topped the figure of 2.2 billion yuan and showed a 
100 percent increase over 1992. The capital construction of the 
new-tech industrial park has entered the stage of 
overall-planned development. Construction has been carried out 
in the four fields of establishing industrial enterprises and 
the enterprises of bringing their function into play, 
implementing the state policies, and exerting influence. The 
park has also deepened its reform in various projects and 
created a relaxed environment for high-and-new tech enterprises 
to persistently enforcing the brand-new mechanism. The park's 
function of turning the high scientific and technological 
results into productive forces has been steadily enhanced and 
played a promoting role in industrializing and 
internationalizing high and new technologies. Over the past few 
years, the municipal industrial park has accumulated over 1,500 
new products of high and new technologies. Of these new 
products, a large number of key products have reached the 
advanced standards at home and abroad and begun to enter 
international markets. 
  During the forum, Gao Dezhan first acknowledged the obvious 
achievements scored by the municipal new-tech industrial park 
over the past few years. He pointed out: Tianjin is filled 
with talented science and technology personnel, has obvious 
strong points in science and technology, and should take greater 
steps in having science and technology make the municipality 
prosperous and strive to do something more worthwhile in this 
regard. Efforts should be made to bring into full play the 
municipal strong points in talented personnel, higher 
educational institutions, the state scientific research 
institutes, and in policies and industries. We should truly 
achieve in bringing the municipal scientific research strong 
points into play and enable the municipal program of 
industrializing high and new technologies to achieve faster and 
better progress. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: The general demand set by the 
municipality for scientific and technological work is to 
accelerate the development of high and new technologies, the 
transfer of scientific and technological results, the 
industrialization of high and new technologies, and the 
construction of new-tech industrial parks and zones. By making 
full and good use of the conditions and policies granted by the 
state, the new-tech industrial park should do a good job in the 
following three aspects: 1) Accelerate the establishment of 
high-and-new tech enterprises. 2) Apply high and new 
technologies to rebuilding the out-dated enterprises and provide 
equal treatment devoid of prejudice to out-dated enterprises as 
long as they conform to the conditions of high and new 
technology. It means that we should not only grasp economic 
growing points but also apply high and new technologies to 
arming the enterprises based on the existing foundation. This 
is an important way to make the municipal economy prosperous. 
3) Make full use of the laboratories and conditions of higher 
educational institutions and scientific research institutes 
throughout the municipality. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: In accelerating the construction in 
the industrial park, we should proceed from reality; create new 
ideas; and make full use of existing conditions. Meanwhile, 
efforts should be made to straighten out the managerial systems; 
to manage what deserves to be managed; and to delegate rights 
that deserve to be delegated so as to enable various circles to 
be enthusiastic in development and to make contributions to 
accelerating the development of such industrial parks and zones 
by proceeding from the whole situation and taking coordinated 
action. 
  Gao Dezhan emphatically pointed out: While accelerating the 
development of the new-tech industrial park, we should also 
attach great importance on scientific and technological work. 
We should create new ideas and measures and make a new 
breakthrough this year to integrate between the task of having 
science and technology be aimed at production and construction 
and that of having production and construction rely on science 
and technology. In particular, we should give priority to the 
following five key points in turning the scientific and 
technological results into practical productive forces: 1) High 
and new technologies should be industrialized; 2) Out-dated 
enterprises should be reformed with high and new technologies; 
3) We should apply high and new technologies to increasing the 
variety of new products; 4) The technical progress of 
enterprises should be accelerated, the products' quality should 
be upgraded, and the cost and consumption of enterprises should 
be lowered; 5) The practical and advanced technologies of 
agriculture should be popularized so as to promote agricultural 
development. Gao Dezhan pointed out: Successfully integrating 
science and technology with production requires the common 
efforts made by several circles. The units of production, 
construction, and management should truly foster their sense of 
science and technology; upgrade their enthusiasm and initiative 
in applying the scientific and technological results; and foster 
the thinking of science and technology that mean funds, time, 
and benefits. Higher educational institutions and scientific 
research units should vigorously upgrade the quality of their 
scientific and technological results, increase the applied 
benefits of them, and do a good job in rendering services. We 
must integrate the appraisal of scientific research units with 
their practical results. As for those that have scored benefits 
in applying the scientific research results, we should give them 
a handsome reward if they deserve commendation. As for those 
who have long failed to turn out research results and whose 
results have not been applied for a long time, we should adopt 
measures to handle them. The departments of government and 
those in charge of the work should enhance macro readjustment 
and control, study the methods of encouragement and support, and 
give encouragement in policies to the applied scientific 
research results. Government departments, departments in charge 
of the work, as well as higher educational institutions and 
scientific research units should commonly make efforts to 
successfully conduct the work of turning the scientific research 
results into productive forces, to accelerate the program of 
having science and technology make the municipality prosperous, 
and to again create a splendid image of Tianjin.

<F P=106> [By reporter Gu Shihong (7357 2514 1347): "Hainan </F>
Implements Preferential Policies for Exit and Entry on Personal 
Reasons"] 
  [Text] Haikou, 8 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- This 
reporter learned from today's news briefing by the Hainan 
Provincial Public Security Department that, entrusted by the 
Ministry of Public Security, Hainan Province had implemented a 
series of preferential exit and entry policies. 
  Peng Xiaomin, of the Exit and Entry Administrative Section 
of 
the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department, said that 
policies toward exit and entry for personal reasons which are 
more preferential than those of other localities in China are as 
follows: 
  First, the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department can 
issue visas directly to Taiwan residents on their landing at the 
Haikou and Sanya ports. According to the policy of "issuing 
visas on landing," Taiwan residents need not go through any 
formalities before they come to Hainan. With valid documents, 
they can fly from Taiwan to Hong Kong, change planes there, and 
come to Hainan. In addition, if Taiwan compatriots wish to go 
to any open city on the mainland, but do not want to stay in 
Hong Kong or Macao to go through formalities, they also can come 
to Hainan first, obtain an "Entry and Exit Permit for Taiwan 
Resident Visiting the Mainland," then take a plane from Hainan 
to the hinterland. They can leave the mainland via any open 
port and without restriction. The Exit and Entry Administrative 
Section of the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department has 
set up visa offices at the airports and wharves of the Haikou 
and Sanya ports where incoming Taiwan compatriots can obtain an 
"Entry and Exit Permit for Taiwan Resident Visiting the 
Mainland" immediately after showing valid documents, filling in 
a form, and submitting two photos. The formalities are very 
simple. 
  Second, it is not only easy to enter Hainan, but convenient 
to leave it, as well. According to Hainan's policy for 
formalities connected with the "Application for Exit Permit With 
a Certificate of Temporary Residence" which have been approved 
by the Ministry of Public Security, working personnel who have 
lived in Hainan for more than six months and who have registered 
their residence outside Hainan may apply in Hainan for travel 
documents to visit other countries and Hong Kong. Working 
personnel who have lived in Hainan for more than one year not 
only can travel to other countries, but also can apply for 
passports for personal reasons, such as to work, to visit 
relatives and friends, or to receive training abroad. In 
particular, Chinese citizens can go by sea to Vietnam following 
the Sanya-Da Nang sea route, and foreigners and Taiwan 
compatriots can come directly from Vietnam to Hainan. It is 
said that this is China's only exit and entry sea link with 
Vietnam. 
  In addition, the Ministry of Public Security and the Hong 
Kong Immigration Department have agreed that beginning 1 January 
this year, the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department may 
issue "Multiple Entry and Exit Permit for Visitors to Hong Kong 
and Macao" for personal reasons. This provides convenience for 
personnel engaged in trade, economic, and science and technology 
activities in Hainan who want to go to Hong Kong. 
  According to statistics, the number of foreigners who came 
to 
Hainan for a short stay last year amounted to 22,887 -- an 
increase of 5.8 percent over the previous year. Last year, the 
number of Taiwan residents who came to Haikou by plane or by sea 
directly from Taiwan via Hong Kong amounted to 4,348.

  [Text] Taipei, May 3 (CNA) -- Taiwan hopes it can be 
removed from the special 301 "watch list" targeted by the United 
States for possible trade sanctions for failure to protect 
intellectual property rights (IPR), Vice Economic Affairs 
Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said Tuesday [3 May]. 
  Sheu made the statement after learning that the US Trade 
Representative (USTR) has decided to move Taiwan from the 
special 301 "priority watch list" to the less threatening "watch 
list" this year. 
  Sheu said Taiwan has made significant progress in IPR 
protection during the past year, including the passage of 
amendments to copyright, trademark and patent laws stipulating 
harsher penalties for offenders. 
  Taiwan has also launched massive crackdowns on commercial 
piracy, Sheu said. "We'll continue law enforcement efforts to 
prevent IPR violations and hope the US can move us from the 
special 301 `watch list' as soon as possible," he added. 
  Sheu reported that police cracked 2,111 cases involving 
copyright violations last year, in which 131,261 pirated music 
cassette tapes, 18,307 videotapes and 19,219 volumes of pirated 
books were confiscated. 
  The number of cases cracked was up 51.5 percent from 1992 
and 
the quantities of seized pirated books, videotapes and music 
tapes were all historic highs, Sheu said. 
  Government authorities received 25,112 applications for 
copyrights in 1993, of which 96.7 percent were filed by local 
residents and the remaining were filed by foreign nationals. 
  Official tallies show that 86 percent of copyright 
applications by local people were approved, while 78 percent of 
those filed by foreigners were approved. 
  The USTR placed Taiwan on the special 301 "priority watch 
list" in April 1993 and decided to keep Taiwan on that list last 
August. Under the special 301 provisions of the trade act of

  [Text] Nice, France, May 2 (CNA) -- Taiwan plans to 
contribute US$15 million this year to the "Asia Development 
Fund" under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help finance 
infrastructure construction plans in less developed Asian 
countries, Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying said here Monday 
[2 May]. 
  Li, heading a 10-member delegation, arrived in Nice Sunday 
to 
attend the 27th ADB annual meeting scheduled to open Tuesday. 
  More than 70 percent of the 55 ADB members have agreed to a 
proposal to double the bank's capitalization to US$48 billion, 
Li said. 
  Against this background, Li said, Taiwan plans to increase 
its annual contribution to the bank's US$32 billion six-phase 
Asia Development Fund to US$15 million this year. 
  Taiwan, an ADB founding member, holds a 1.12 percent stake 
in 
the Manila-based bank. Li said all ADB members are required to 
inform bank management whether they support the proposed bank 
capital increment by mail before May 22. 
  Li said he will issue a formal statement Wednesday urging 
the 
ADB to change Taiwan's designation in the bank to "Taipei China" 
instead of the current "Taipei, China." 
  Taipei believes that the "Taipei, China" designation 
relegates Taiwan's government to a local government and not a 
sovereign political entity. 
  Under Beijing's pressure, the ADB unilaterally changed 
Taiwan's designation from the "Republic of China [ROC]" to 
"Taipei, China" in 1986 when Beijing joined the bank. 
  Taipei refused to take part in any ADB activities in protest 
of the unfair treatment in 1986 and 1987. It resumed 
participation in ADB activities in 1988. 
  Taipei has since consistently voiced protests against the 
name change during the annual ADB meeting. 
  Li said he asked ADB Governor Mitsuo Sato to seriously 
consider the name issue during this year's meeting. "I told 
Sato during a meeting Monday that Taiwan wants its designation 
in the ADB to be changed to `Taipei China,'" he added. 
  In reply, Sato said he understood Taiwan's stance and would 
pay "special attention" to the issue. 
  The three-day ADB annual meeting will close Thursday.

  [Text] Taipei, May 3 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Japan took a 
step closer to understanding each other's trade needs during 
informal tariff reduction talks under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) framework last week, Huang Yen-chao, 
director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade, said Monday [2 
May]. 
  Huang said that Taiwan expressed its concern about its huge 
trade deficit with Japan during the talks, and also discussed 
opening its market to Japanese agricultural products, alcohol 
and tobacco. 
  Japan, although supportive of Taiwan's bid to enter GATT, 
expressed the hope that Taiwan would move faster in opening its 
markets, Huang added. 
  (Huang said that Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan rose 
above 
US$15 billion in the past 15 months. He said he asked the 
Japanese side to lower import barriers to facilitate foreign 
exports. 
  Japanese negotiators responded that Japan would begin 
substantive measures in June to increase imports in line with 
economic reforms. 
  Taiwan also proposed that the two sides hold regular trade 
consultations, similar to those held between Taiwan and the 
European Union and the United States. Japan replied that it 
would consider the proposal. 
  Huang said that Japan asked Taiwan to end discriminatory 
treatment on imports of Japanese agricultural products, 
automobiles, alcohol and tobacco. 
  On agricultural products, Taiwan asked for a six-year grace 
period before allowing the import of Japanese fruits, but Japan 
rejected the proposal and further negotiations are necessary, 
Huang said. 
  On imports of Japanese automobiles, Taiwan said that it 
would 
allow the imports of Japanese cars with engine sizes of 3000 
cubic centimeters and above by the end of this year, Huang added. 
  Huang also said that Japan would submit a list of proposed 
tariff cuts for Taiwan during a mid-May meeting of the GATT 
fifth working party reviewing Taiwan's membership bid. 
  Taiwan applied for GATT membership in January 1990 and was 
given observer status in September 1992. It hopes to become a 
full member by the end of the year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 3 (CNA) -- The Taipei-based Chinese 
National Federation of Industries and the Hong Kong General 
Chamber of Commerce Tuesday [3 May] signed a memorandum of 
understanding [MOU] to forge closer trade ties. 
  Under the memorandum, both sides pledge to join hands to 
help 
promote trade exchanges among Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland 
China and push for the opening of the mainland's service markets. 
  Meanwhile, Taiwan asks Hong Kong to give a helping hand to 
Taiwan's efforts to become an Asia-Pacific business operations 
center, to grant seven-day visa-free stay to Taiwan visitors who 
will proceed to other countries, and to simplify visa 
application procedures for Taiwan visitors. 
  On the other hand, the Hong Kong side suggests that Taiwan 
accelerate opening of its financial market to Hong Kong 
investors, further relax restrictions on merchandise trade among 
Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Taiwan, and open the flight route 
between Taipei's Sungshan Airport and Hong Kong. 
  Federation Chairman Kao Ching-yuan and Chairman Paul Cheng 
of 
the General Chamber of Commerce inked the document during the 
fourth Taiwan-Hong Kong trade cooperation conference at the 
Howard Plaza Hotel. 
  More than 100 representatives from the two organizations 
took 
part in the one-day meeting, during which panel discussions on 
manufacturing, banking, and service industries were held. 
  Vice Chairman Hsueh Chi of the Council for Economic Planning 
and Development, Vice Chairman Su Chi of the Mainland Affairs 
Council, and Director-General Ricky Y. S. Kao of the industrial 
development and investment center were invited to deliver 
speeches at the meeting. 
  Taiwan has maintained close economic ties with Hong Kong, 
which has been the entrepot of cross-strait indirect trade. 
Two-way trade totaled US$20.4 billion last year, in which 
Taiwan enjoyed a surplus of US$16.9 billion. 
  In 1993, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade accounted for 12 percent of 
Taiwan's total foreign trade.

  [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- A high-ranking agriculture 
official on Monday [2 May] denied rumors that the government has 
indicated during negotiations with GATT members over Taiwan's 
entry into the world trade body that it will back away from rice 
farmers in exchange for continued protection of the local car 
industry. 
  Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of the Council of Agriculture, said 
during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan that 
the report that prompted the rumor was "groundless." 
  A newspaper reported last week that GATT contracting parties 
are permitted to protect a single industry in line with GATT 
provisions, and that the government had decided to favor the car 
industry at the expense of the rice industry because it employs 
600,000 more people than the rice industry. 
  In fact, GATT rules allow countries to protect their 
agricultural markets more than their industrial markets. To 
that end, Sun said, the government would continue in GATT 
negotiations to push for limited access to Taiwan's agricultural 
market. 
  Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang also refuted the 
rumors, saying the government will do everything it can to win 
extra adjustment time for the agricultural sector while pushing 
for entry into the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body. 
  Taiwan applied for GATT membership in 1990 under the name of 
"the customs territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," and 
has been involved in four GATT working-party meetings since 
then. The fifth is scheduled for May 16-19 in Geneva. 
  Taiwan held talks with the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand 
and Japan last week on tariff reductions, and will meet with the 
United States next week.

  [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui will 
start his 13-day, four-country overseas tour Wednesday [4 May] 
with an aim toward promoting Taiwan's relations with its allies. 
  The tour will take Li to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa 
and Swaziland, all of which maintain close official relations 
with the Republic of China [ROC]. 
  President Li will sign joint communiques with Nicaraguan, 
Costa Rican and Swazi presidents pledging to continue 
strengthening bilateral relations, the ministry of foreign 
affairs said Monday. 
  Li is scheduled to arrive in Managua, Nicaragua on 
Wednesday, 
(local time) for a two-day visit, the ministry said. The 
Nicaraguan Government will give Li a 21-gun salute. 
  Li will deliver a speech to the Nicaraguan Congress on 
Thursday, and the congress will confer a medal to Li in 
recognition of his contribution to promoting ROC-Nicaraguan 
relations. Li will be the fourth recipient of such an honor. 
  Li will then fly to Costa Rica on Friday for a three-day 
visit. While there, he will attend the inauguration of 
President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres, which is scheduled to take 
place on Sunday. While there, Li will visit an export 
processing zone Taiwan's BES Engineering Corp. has built to 
attract Taiwan investment to the Central American country. 
  Li will then proceed to South Africa, where on may 10 he 
will 
attend the inauguration of the new South African president. 
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela is widely 
believed to have won that country's first multiracial 
presidential election. 
  The Foreign Affairs Ministry said it is arranging for 
meetings between Li and South African leaders, including Mandela 
and incumbent President F.W. de Klerk. 
  Li will fly to Swaziland May 12 for a state visit. In 
addition to meeting with Swazi King Mswati III, he will also 
visit a demonstration farm and a handicraft center that the ROC 
has helped establish there. 
  Li and his entourage are scheduled to return to Taipei May 
16. 
  This will be Li's first official overseas tour since he 
assumed the presidency in 1988. He made unofficial visits to 
Singapore in 1989 and to the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand 
in February this year. All four Southeast Asian countries 
recognize Beijing, while maintaining close economic ties with 
Taiwan.

  [Text] During a budget examination on 27 April, the 
Legislative Yuan froze the No. 4 nuclear power plant portion of 
the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] budget due to the plant's 
alteration of its generator capacity. The Legislative Yuan 
Education Committee examined the AEC budget yesterday [27 April]. 
  After completing the environmental impact appraisal of the 
power plant, the Taiwan Power Company and the AEC rapidly 
approved the power plant's plan to enlarge its generator 
capacity by one third. The altered plan has caused concern among 
many Legislative Yuan members. Some have interpellated the 
event. Legislative Yuan member (Meng Chun-chu) called for 
freezing the power plant's portion of the AEC budget before 
completing a reappraisal of environmental impact under the new 
plan. The portion totals 24 million yuan, including the power 
plant's budget for reexamination of transport plan, industrial 
cooperation planning, and other technological matters.

  [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- A prosecutor in the central 
Taiwan city of Chiayi charged 15 people with either vote-buying 
or graft during the city and county council speaker and deputy 
speaker elections that culminated on March 1. 
  The prosecutor recommended 34 months in jail for speaker 
Hsiao Teng-wang and five years for Deputy Speaker Chen Chun-kui 
for vote- buying if they are found guilty. 
  An investigation showed that Hsiao and Chen had offered NT$1 
[new Taiwan dollars] million (US$37,878) and NT$800,000, 
respectively, to each councilor who would vote for them. 
  The prosecutor also proposed a jail term of two years for 
councilors Chang Tung-kun and Li Tien-lang, who were suspected 
of buying votes on behalf of Hsiao and Chen. 
  Eleven other people face proposed jail terms of between 
eight 
months and 18 months for their roles in the nation's worst 
election scandal. 
  At least 360 people around Taiwan, including 13 speakers, 
nine deputy speakers and 185 councilors, have so far been 
indicted on graft charges as the investigation into the scandal 
continues to unfold. 
  The Chiayi County Council on Monday emerged unscathed from 
the scandal when the Chiayi prosecutor's office concluded an 
investigation into the election of the council with nobody being 
charged. 
  The ruling Kuomintang won all 23 city and county speaker 
positions at stake in the polls.

  [Text] Taipei, May 2 (CNA) -- Shih Ming-the, the newly 
elected chairman of the major opposition Democratic Progressive 
Party (DPP), said Monday [2 May] that if he is elected president 
of the Republic of China [ROC], he will not abruptly announce 
Taiwan's independence. 
  Shih pledged that he would not make Taiwan independent by 
means of revolution or violence. "Whatever the DPP does will be 
in compliance with the will of Taiwanese people," he said. 
  The new DPP chairman said he was confident that he would win 
a popular vote for ROC president. 
  Previously, the president was selected by the National 
Assembly. But a special session of the assembly that opened 
Monday to consider constitutional reforms is expected to mandate 
the popular election of president. 
  Shih, 53, was elected the DPP's sixth chairman during the 
party congress Sunday. Shih beat Ms. Yu Chen Yueh-ying by a 
vote of 206 to 145. His tenure will be two and a half years. 
  Shih had served 25 years in Taiwan prisons. He was jailed 
for 10 years for participating in an anti-government riot in the 
southern city of Kaohsiung in 1979, and was also jailed from 
1962 through 1977 for his attempts at organizing the overthrow 
of the government. 
  He has been a devoted advocate of Taiwan independence, a 
goal 
in direct opposition to the ruling Kuomintang's policy, which 
seeks Taiwan's eventual reunification with Mainland China. 
  The DPP was founded in 1986 in defiance of a decades-old ban 
on the establishment of new political parties. The ban was 
lifted in 1987 as part of ongoing democratic reforms.

Ministry of Economic Affairs said Monday. 
  Occupying an area of 4.03 hectares in the Taipei suburb of 
Nankang, the software complex calls for a total investment of 
NT$7.1 [new Taiwan dollars] billion (US$267.92 million), of 
which US$5 billion (US$188.67 million) will come from a 
syndicated bank loan, ministry officials noted. 
  Shih Cheng Development Co. is in charge of the project, 
which 
aims to build a first-class research and development environment 
for the software industry and thus help upgrade Taiwan's 
industrial base, they said. 
  The park will be completed in 1995, and is expected to have 
6,000 software workers.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 30 (XINHUA) -- A delegation from 
the American Chamber of Commerce here departed today on its 
annual trip to Washington to urge unconditional extension of 
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China. 
  According to the chamber, the lobbying group, led by 
Chairman 
Gerald Murdock and President Frank Martin, will make it clear 
that "the chamber has been, and continues to be, adamantly 
opposed to any conditions placed on China's MFN." 
  Murdock said, "while we believe the promotion of American 
values is and must remain an important part of American foreign 
policy, the current annual MFN debate, featuring human rights as 
the defining issue in our China policy, is both 
counterproductive to the overall relationship and ineffective in 
fostering long-term human rights improvements." 
  He said his chamber will fully endorse the view expressed in 
Washington this week by Hong Kong Chief Secretary Anson Chan 
that "continuous, constructive dialogue and engagement with 
China "is the best solution." 
  "Linking human rights or other conditions to a worldwide 
standard of trade is not in the interest of either country," 
Murdock said. 
  He said, "over the past several years, the human rights 
situation in China has improved significantly." 
  The delegation will meet with relevant U.S. officials in 
Washington from May 2 to 6. Six members of the American Chamber 
of Commerce in Beijing will join those from Hong Kong for a 
total of 23 delegates, the largest mission to date. 
  In another development, Chief Secretary Anson Chan described 
her meeting with U.S. Vice-President Al Gore on Friday [29 
April] at the White House as extremely useful and interesting. 
  Anson Chan said, "we had a good discussion about the MFN 
issue, how this might impact on the U.S.-China relationship and 
on conditions in Hong Kong." 
  She said Hong Kong in the 21st century will matter to the 
Chinese mainland, Asia and the rest of the world. 
  "It will matter to U.S. business as a prosperous, open and 
externally-oriented market, as a gateway to China and as a 
business center for East Asia as a whole," Anson Chan added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 2 (XINHUA)--The Hong Kong dollar 
notes issued by Bank of China (BOC) are officially put into 
circulation here today with a ceremony held inside the BOC tower 
and thousands of customers on long queues outside the tower 
waiting for getting the new banknotes. Long queues were seen 
at 31 sub-branches and 44 automatic teller machines of the BOC 
Hong Kong branch throughout the territory. Many of them started 
waiting for their turns at midnight. "It's very memorable," an 
old customer told reporters in the BOC tower with the new 
banknotes in his hands. Speaking at the celebration ceremony, 
Wang Qiren, chairman of the directors board of the BOC, 
described the issuance as "a very significant event for BOC 
throughout its over 80 years of operation" and "an important 
occasion in the economic life of Hong Kong". "BOC's 
participation in note-issuing indicates China's confidence in 
the future of Hong Kong and the bank's readiness to undertake, 
with its strength and reputation, the responsibility for Hong 
Kong's smooth transition," Wang said. "As one of the note 
issuing banks, bank of China will operate strictly in accordance 
with the financial laws and regulations of Hong Kong and, along 
with the Hongkong Bank and the Standard Chartered Bank, continue 
to play its part for the monetary stability and development of 
Hong Kong," he said. Citing an old Chinese saying: The 
ability of horse is known by travelling far and the faithfulness 
of a person is revealed by the lapse of time, he said, "ever 
since its establishment, Bank of China has always followed its 
objective of taking root in Hong Kong and rendering services in 
Hong Kong." "For a long time," he said, "the bank has actively 
contributed to maintaining the stability and prosperity of Hong 
Kong and has won the confidence and trust of the public. By the 
same token, our issue of banknotes has also received extensive 
support from the local community." Wang said the issue of Hong 
Kong dollar notes by Bank of China, from planning to official 
circulation took only 20 months to complete. This speedy 
process has been made possible through the great support and 
cooperation given by many related parties in Hong Kong and in 
the mainland. He expressed, on behalf of Bank of China head 
office, heartfelt gratitude to all those who have rendered their 
great support towards the issue of new banknotes. Among 
hundreds attending the ceremony were Ann Tse-kai and Henry Fok 
Ying-tung, both vice chairmen of the national committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Lu Ping, 
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State 
Council, Zhou Nan, director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong 
branch, and Jin Renqing, vice minister of finance, as well as 
well-known figures Li Ka-shing, Kuok Hock-nien and Li Kwok-po. 
Cutting ribbon for the ceremony were Chen Yuan, vice president 
of the People's Bank of China, Wang Qiren, chairman of BOC 
Directors Board, Huang Diyan, vice chairman of BOC Directors 
Board and chief executive of BOC Hong Kong-Macao regional 
office, and Zhou Zhenxing, general manager of BOC Hong Kong 
branch, as well as Joseph Yam, chief executive of Hong Kong 
monetary authority. The Hong Kong [H.K.] dollar notes issued 
by the BOC are in five denominations: 1,000 H.K. dollars, 500 
H.K. dollars, 100 H.K. dollars, 50 H.K. dollars and 20 H.K. 
dollars. The sizes and color schemes of the notes are 
consistent with those currently issued by the other two banks. 
The front panel of the notes features the Bank of China tower, 
bank logo, different floral patterns and a stone lion watermark. 
The bank panel features a number of scenic spots and landmarks 
of Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Dong Huifeng (5516 2585 1496): "Wang </F>
Fengchao Speaks About Xi Yang's Case"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wang Fengchao, 
deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, today said that Xi Yang's case is completely 
unrelated to freedom of the press when he met the visiting Hong 
Kong "Labor Day" trade union delegation. 
  He explained: First, Xi Yang's activities were not normal 
news covering activities. According to the regulations 
concerned, Hong Kong and Macao reporters should first submit 
applications to the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch before they come to 
the mainland to cover news and should then obtain the 
concurrence of the units that they want to interview through the 
Chinese Journalists Association. Last year, Xi Yang applied to 
cover news about the Hope Project, the Sino-British talks, and 
the meeting of the Preparatory Working Committee; he did not 
apply to cover economic and financial news. However, he used his 
personal connections and stole state economic and financial 
secrets from Tian Ye. Tian Ye was not an interviewee. Xi Yang 
was not engaging in "normal news gathering," and he "entered the 
forbidden zone by mistake." 
  Second, Xi Yang worked as reporter on the mainland for eight 
years and was well aware of the difference between normal news 
gathering and stealing secrets. 
  Wang Fengchao pointed out: According to the written law on 
the Chinese mainland, three types of penalties would be meted 
out to those who stole state secrets like Xi Yang: 1) over 10 
years' imprisonment, 2) life imprisonment, and 3) death. 
Because Xi Yang showed a repentant attitude, a less severe 
penalty was meted out to him, and he was sentenced to 12 years' 
imprisonment. 
  Wang Fengchao said: Since last year, over 1,000 Hong Kong 
reporters have entered China to cover news, but only Xi Yang has 
had trouble. This shows that most people were aware of the 
regulations, and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office did a 
great deal of work. It made announcements about these 
regulations four times. At present, control over the news 
gathering activities of Hong Kong and Macao reporters on the 
mainland is rather relaxed. They only need to go through the 
application procedure. Interviewees bear the responsibility for 
the contents of all approved interviews. We continue to welcome 
Hong Kong and Macao reporters to conduct normal news gathering 
as they have done in the past. 
  Wang Fengchao answered the visitors' questions about the 
localization of civil servants and retirement guarantees. 
  He reiterated the relevant provisions of the Basic Law and 
said: We agree that the civil service localization process 
should be accelerated, but changes in the employment system for 
civil servants will lead to major changes in Hong Kong's civil 
service system. During the transition period -- especially the 
late transition period -- the fewer changes the better. Only 
the 20-plus senior officials should be chosen from among the 
Chinese residents who are permanent residents of Hong Kong 
without foreign right of abode. Foreigners who hold the identity 
card of a permanent resident of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region can be civil servants at all other posts. 
It is hoped that the current civil servants will remain in Hong 
Kong after 1997 and will continue to serve the Special 
Administrative Region [SAR]. 
  As for the issue of retirement guarantees, Wang Fengchao 
said 
that, after 1997, the SAR Government will formulate the relevant 
policies on its own according to the provisions of the Basic Law 
and the economic conditions and social needs of Hong Kong. 
  The 20-member Hong Kong "Labor Day" trade union delegation 
headed by Chan Wai-han will return to Hong Kong on 2 May.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 6 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Recently, 
there have been some comments in Hong Kong society asserting 
that PRC-invested enterprises in the territory speculate in real 
estate, giving an impression to people that PRC-invested 
enterprises are to blame for soaring real estate prices. 
Obviously, this is not true, because in Hong Kong all kinds of 
capital is assigned to the real estate market, and capital from 
PRC-invested enterprises only accounts for a limited percentage 
of the Hong Kong real estate market as a whole. Quite a number 
of PRC-invested enterprises in Hong Kong have a real need for 
real estate, and only a small number of them are speculating. 
  Over the last few years, PRC-invested enterprises in Hong 
Kong have been active in developing their business; they have a 
strong need for all types of buildings for use as offices and 
production sites. This situation is similar to that of other 
financial organizations. But PRC-invested enterprises' 
activities in the Hong Kong real estate market have aroused 
particular concern because of their sensitive background. Apart 
from this, their rapid development has also caused such concerns. 
  According to recent statistics published by the Hong Kong 
Government, PRC-invested enterprises play quite an important 
role in Hong Kong's economy. Take banking as an example. There 
are 15 PRC-capitalized licensed banks in Hong Kong, including 13 
licensed banks affiliated to the Bank of China Group, and Ka Wah 
Bank and Union Bank, which belong respectively to the China 
International Trust and Investment Corporation and the China 
Merchants Steam Navigation Company Limited. PRC-capitalized 
banks have actively developed their retail business and expanded 
their branches, hence the need to buy real estate. 
  In manufacturing industry, industrial projects with mainland 
investments amounted to 39 at the end of 1992, and total 
investment stood at HK$4.133 billion [Hong Kong dollars] 
calculated by original cost, the third largest source of 
industrial investment after Japan and the United States. 
Calculated on the basis of original costs, the total value of 
their total fixed assets amounts to HK$2.9 billion. This, of 
course, includes the value of factory buildings. 
  A survey by the Hong Kong Department of Industry in 1993 on 
regional representative offices set up in Hong Kong by foreign 
firms suggested that PRC-invested enterprises had established 67 
regional headquarters in Hong Kong and were working hard to 
catch up with U.S., Japanese, and British financial groups. 
  Thus, it can be seen that PRC-invested enterprises have a 
strong need to buy all types of buildings. 
  However, we cannot rule out the possibility that a small 
number of PRC-invested enterprises speculate in Hong Kong's real 
estate market, but this problem is not serious and has received 
proper attention from the relevant Chinese department. Some 
comments in society have attributed the cause of real estate 
price hikes entirely to speculation, overlooking the basic 
factor of supply falling short of demand. These comments have 
even blamed PRC-invested enterprises for soaring real estate 
prices. Evidently, this is irrational and unfair, because other 
financial groups are also speculating in the real estate market. 
  Real estate prices and rents have kept rising in recent 
years. Unquestionably, this has much to do with real estate 
speculation, but in a free market economy, all commodity prices 
are determined by the balance between supply and demand. The 
Hong Kong Government bears a major responsibility for the real 
estate price rises of recent years, because it does not have a 
strategy and the supply of land is imbalanced. It takes more 
than one cold day for a river to freeze three feet deep. In 
curbing real estate speculation, the Hong Kong Government should 
not just introduce several short-term measures, as these cannot 
resolve the problems. Overly rigorous short-term measures could 
lead the economy into a predicament.

<F P=106> ["Inside Politics" column, by Danny Gittings: "McGregor </F>
Defeat Shows Business Slant on China"] 
  [Text] The significance of veteran legislator Jimmy 
McGregor's defeat in last week's Hong Kong General Chamber of 
Commerce elections goes far beyond the probable end to the 
political career of one of the territory's best-known 
expatriates. The general committee poll is widely seen as an 
indicator of whether Mr McGregor will hold his own in next 
year's contest for the chamber's Legislative Council functional 
constituency seat, a position he currently occupies. And the 
overall message is not good for Mr McGregor, or for those who 
share his views. The veteran legislator ended up at the bottom 
of the committee poll, winning an embarrassingly low 543 votes. 
The result is a clear sign the business community no longer 
sees any role for those who try to reconcile the democratic 
aspirations of most people in Hong Kong with the need for good 
relations with Beijing. 
  It is all too easy--amid the headlines about his defeat by 
pro-China forces--to overlook the fact that Mr McGregor is a 
moderate. Radicals, such as independent Emily Lau Wai-hing, 
regard him with suspicion, describing him as only a partial 
democrat. Although the veteran legislator has been widely 
associated with Governor Chris Patten's political reform 
proposals, it is often forgotten that he strenuously opposes one 
of their central elements: the creation of nine new functional 
constituencies, embracing virtually all of Hong Kong's 2.7 
million workers. Even the Governor's compromise blueprint, put 
forward during last year's unsuccessful negotiations with 
Beijing, to instead have nine new organisational-based seats 
with an electorate of 840,000, is too much for Mr McGregor. He 
is planning to propose still smaller constituencies during the 
forthcoming Legislative Council debate on the electoral 
legislation. 
  As far as he is concerned, Mr Patten's proposals are beyond 
the pale, since they breach what China understands to be the 
original concept of functional constituencies: small 
organisational-based seats. Nor will he have any truck with 
attempts to bring in more democracy than is allowed under any 
reasonable interpretation of the Basic Law: he is strongly 
opposed to the United Democrats attempt to push through 30 
directly-elected seats for next year's polls. Yet none of this 
is enough to satisfy today's business leaders who, as Mr Patten 
discovered as soon as he arrived, are desperate not to do 
anything that may offend Beijing. 
  Even Mr McGregor's support for the Governor's modest 
attempts 
to reform the voting system for the existing 21 functional 
constituencies, and introduce a democratically-chosen election 
committee, is too much for them. As far as they are concerned, 
the veteran legislator has long been living on borrowed time. 
His one-time supporter, former Hutchison Whampoa managing 
director Simon Murray is gone, a victim of tycoon Li Ka-shing's 
decision, like most of the Hong Kong business community, to 
concentrate on investments in the mainland. Instead, the 
attitudes of leading businessmen today are best represented by 
their decision not to invite Mr Patten to Friday's luncheon with 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office chief Lu Ping for fear it 
will offend the visiting mainland official. 
  So the most that can be hoped for in today's climate is to 
see a socially -- rather than politically--liberal businessman 
take Mr McGregor's place. Fortunately one is available, in the 
shape of appointed legislator Henry Tang Ying-yen. While Mr 
Tang may lack Mr McGregor's instinct to push democracy as far as 
reasonably possible, he has already made his mark as one of the 
few local businessmen ready to maintain good relations with 
trade unionists, and even support the introduction of a central 
provident fund. 
  Mr Tang, who has long been tipped to run for the chamber's 
functional constituency seat next year, should have no 
difficulty winning if he chooses to stand. The Liberal Party 
legislator has just been elected to the chamber's general 
committee with 1,224 votes, more than twice as many as his 
potential rival Mr McGregor managed to garner. 
  But all this does not mean the old war-horse should give up 
without a fight. Although Mr McGregor now looks destined for 
defeat in next year's contest, it is to be hoped he will give it 
one more shot. Even if he is defeated, there should be a role 
for him as an adviser to the new Democratic Party, formed by the 
merger of the United Democrats and Meeting Point. He will also 
remain living proof of what is all too rare in Hong Kong: that 
businessmen can, and should, have a democratic face.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 29 (AFP)--The pro-China political 
party Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong called 
Friday on China to maintain "normal contacts" with the territory 
in the run-up to 1997. 
  In one of its 10 recommendations to the Chinese government, 
the party urged that "normal contacts" to be maintained between 
Chinese and Hong Kong officials "at all levels...to enable 
continuous and efficient cooperation over transition matters." 
  Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty on July 1, 1997. 
  The recommendations were made as Lu Ping, head of China's 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, was expected to arrive here 
Sunday [1 May] to attend a meeting of sub-groups under the 
Preliminary Work Committee (PWC). The PWC, which is appointed 
by Beijing, was set up by China to prepare for the 1997 hand 
over. Lu however has decided not to meet Hong Kong Governor 
Chris Patten while in the territory. 
  Patten, who has irked Beijing by going ahead with 
controversial electoral reforms, expressed disappointment at 
Lu's refusal to meet him but reiterated his willingness to meet 
Lu at the Chinese official's convenience. 
  The party also pointed out that "disruption caused by the 
lack of convergence (on political issues) should be minimised as 
far as possible," and urged the PWC to work "with more 
transparency." 
  In a statement, the party said that "the people of Hong Kong 
need to learn more about China, while the Chinese government 
must attend to the hopes and fears of Hong Kong, so that mutual 
trust can be built up between the two sides."

<F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Fred Li, Meeting Point </F>
legislator: "New Airport Is the Latest Issue Mangled by UK-Sino 
Politics"] 
  [Text] Liberal Party Legislative Councillor Steven Poon's 
motion on the airport project said: "This council urges the 
Hong Kong government to initiate a series of commitments, which 
include considering further capital injection to facilitate 
China's agreement on the Chek Lap Kok new project financing 
arrangement together with that of the railway link. 
  "The solution of the problem will lead to the speedy 
completion of the whole project, which will be a significant 
boost to the local economic growth, further translating into the 
betterment of Hong Kong people's livelihood." 
  After seriously considering this motion, The Meeting Point 
delegated me to amend this motion. 
  For the record and to put matters in perspective, the 
amendment reads as follows: "This council urges the Hong Kong 
government to initiate a series of commitments, including 
considering further capital injection and forward it with 
substantiated proposals to this council for scrutiny. 
  "This move will surely facilitate the speedy completion of 
the whole project which will significantly boost economic growth 
and enhance Hong Kong people's livelihood." 
  This time around, the pros and cons of the airport issue and 
its ensuing amendment have puzzled the general public because 
they pose two starkly divergent points of view. 
  First, immediately after my amendment, fellow Councillor 
Howard Young moved an amendment to mine by putting back the 
deleted words "to facilitate China's agreement on the Chek Lap 
Kok project." But, at the same time, he retained my words 
"forward it with substantiated proposals to this council for 
scrutiny." 
  Why are there different view points reflected in Steven 
Poon's motion and my amendment? The explanation is this: Hong 
Kong people have been mangled by Sino-British political row of 
which Chek Lap Kok is a part. Ever since British special envoy 
Sir Percy Cradock secretly visited China in 1991 and emerged 
with a compromise that led to the signing of the Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU), the British side has lodged four financial 
arrangement packages for China's approval over a period of more 
than two years. But still to no avail. 
  That the airport financing issue is still outstanding 
notwithstanding the signing of the memorandum is the result of 
two built-in flaws. The first is a political approach to a 
practical, economic and technical issue. The second is the 
unrelated Sino- British negotiation, which should have been 
dealt with locally. The conflicting views expressed in 
Councillor Steven Poon's motion and my amendment mirror the 
second default. 
  Meeting Point and I share the same opinion -- the airport 
construction project is a local affair and should have been 
decided and acted upon in accordance with decisions locally 
arrived at. And, as the Legislative Council is an organisation 
representing local viewpoints, it should have used the powers 
vested in it to monitor and scrutinize such a colossal 
undertaking essentially financed by the public coffer. 
Moreover, as the airport project involves the two sovereign 
countries -- Britain and China -- they may well have done a 
great service to Hong Kong by honouring decisions reached 
through our legislature. 
  Councillor Steven Poon based his argument on the premise 
that 
any settlement of the airport case should correspond with the 
MOU theme. 
  Elected Legislative Councillors who have been given a 
mandate 
through the 1991 direct elections to represent the electorate 
seem to have been sidelined on this issue. At best, they are 
regarded as no more than rubber stamps. But, if they do not 
meet this assumption of rubber-stampers, the British side is 
accused of manipulating the legislature to sabotage the 
bilateral agreement reached through diplomacy by the British and 
Chinese governments. 
  Understanding this and seeing things through this 
perspective, we can assume the negotiated agreement, though not 
entirely in our people's interests is, first, insignificant and, 
secondly, has to be force-fed to highlight the MOU principle. 
Such is the logic behind Sir Percy's design. 
  Otherwise how could two sovereign countries taking pains to 
assign their heads of governments to negotiate and formalise an 
agreement in the form of a MOU to sort out a problem of a tiny, 
far-off place called Hong Kong? Councillor Howard Young has 
side-stepped the issue in this regard, because he has not 
differentiated the roles supposedly to be played by the local 
decision-making mechanism and the two central governments. 
  The amendment I made points to a plausible way out for a 
local problem without raising voices. I say give it a try.

  [Text] China is to tighten the way it handles applications 
from the Hong Kong media, following the jailing last month of 
Ming Pao reporter Xi Yang. Officials had adopted a flexible 
approach towards applications for reporting on the mainland, 
said deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
Wang Fengchao. But, in future, the rules would have to be 
strictly followed "to avoid confusion", Mr Wang told a 
delegation from the Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing 
yesterday. 
  "Because the response from Hong Kong was that it was 
difficult to understand the system in China when it suddenly 
tightened its rules and imposed a 12-year penalty on Xi Yang, Mr 
Wang said it was better for China to stick to its rules," said 
the federation's Chan Yuen- han after the meeting with Mr Wang. 
Xi was jailed for 12 years for "stealing state secrets". He 
was accused of publishing details last summer of Beijing's plan 
to sell gold and raise interest rates in defence of the exchange 
rate. Mr Wang asked other Hong Kong journalists to stick to the 
confines of their approved reporting activities while on the 
mainland. 
  China's State Council has seven rules regarding reporting 
activities in China. They stipulate that all reporters must 
apply in advance to cover any activity in China and that the 
coverage should not go beyond the items listed in the 
application form. Mr Wang said more than a thousand Hong Kong 
reporters had visited China since last year and only Xi had been 
arrested, illustrating that most reporters knew and followed the 
law. 
  He said Xi had asked to cover news related to the 
Sino-British talks, meetings of the Preliminary Working 
Committee and an education project, but had failed to spell out 
his intention to cover news related to China's state finances 
and economy. Xi had been a reporter on the mainland for more 
than eight years and should have known the boundaries 
distinguishing normal reporting and spying for state secrets, Mr 
Wang said. He said that was why Xi could not be regarded as 
unintentionally trespassing in the "restricted areas". 
  He said Hong Kong and China had different legal systems and 
Hong Kong people should not use their legal standards to make 
judgments about China's system. Director of the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping has assured that Xi's sentence 
"will not affect Hong Kong reporters' normal reporting work".

  [Text] The rift between Britain and China over the issuing 
of new passports for Hong Kong people looks set to deepen, with 
Beijing reluctant to lobby other countries for easier visa 
arrangements. 
  The Hong Kong government has proposed that China lobby more 
than 70 countries for the permanent abolition of visa 
requirements for holders of the Hong Kong British National 
(Overseas) (BNO) passport and the future Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) travel document. 
  But a senior government official has revealed that Beijing 
has shown reluctance to hold talks with other governments on the 
issue. Beijing has yet to discuss SAR passports, despite 
numerous requests for talks on the matter by Britain over the 
past 12 months. And approaches by the British government have 
been met with silence. But the Hong Kong government fears that 
China's indifference to the latest request for co-operation 
could result in future difficulties for Hong Kong people. 
  At present, 71 countries waive visa requirements for BNO 
passport holders. However, there is no guarantee that the 
arrangement will continue beyond 1997 as Hong Kong people will 
be regarded as Chinese nationals and may hold both passports. 
  "The British side's proposal is based on goodwill, aiming to 
secure freedom of travel for the people of Hong Kong, which is 
enshrined in the Joint Declaration and essential for Hong Kong's 
continuous prosperity in future," said a government official. 
However, a Chinese official said Beijing was unlikely to 
cooperate with the request because China viewed visa abolition 
agreements with foreign governments for SAR passport holders as 
an issue to be dealt with exclusively by Hong Kong's future 
sovereign power. 
  China has not yet made any unilateral efforts to hold talks 
with foreign governments on recognition of SAR passports or visa 
arrangements. But it is understood that Western governments 
could categorise the SAR passports in the same manner as normal 
passports issued by Beijing. 
  Among the countries that currently waive entry visas for 
short stays for BNO passport holders, only Thailand, South 
Africa and Poland have formal written agreements with the Hong 
Kong government. Another 10 countries that have visa abolition 
agreements do so as an extension of similar agreements with 
Britain. It is still not clear whether such agreements will 
remain in place after 1997. 
  The ten countries are Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, 
Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Iceland, San Marino, Argentina, and 
Liechtenstein. The issue will be discussed again at a meeting 
of team experts of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group at the 
end of the month, but arrangements will not be made without 
Beijing's co-operation.

<F P=106> [By Beverly Chau in Manila] </F>
  [Text] Construction and power magnate Gordon Wu 
Ying-Sheung is considering pulling out of mainland power 
projects because of the officially imposed cap on returns for 
foreign investors. Mr Wu, managing director of Hopewell 
Holdings and the recently floated Consolidated Electric Power 
Asia (CEPA), said his companies would look for more attractive 
developments in Asia. "I find a lot of places which are much 
greener than China," Mr Wu said. 
  CEPA has become embroiled in a row with mainland authorities 
on the level of returns offered by China on foreign investments 
in power projects. Beijing has capped returns at 12 per cent, 
compared with the 18 per cent which Mr Wu said he was offered by 
other Asian countries. Hopewell Holdings, the construction arm 
of Mr Wu's business empire, is also battling on another front 
over the construction costs of the Boca Tigris bridge in 
Guangdong province. 
  The 59-year-old businessman attacked mainland authorities at 
a seminar in Hong Kong earlier this week when he claimed the 
returns were too low by international standards. He said a 
realistic rate was about 18 per cent and 15 to 16 per cent was 
workable if the Government cut the red tape involved in setting 
up power projects. However, he stepped up his attack in Manila 
on Friday on his way to a ground-breaking ceremony for CEPA's 
latest power station, a US$1.6 billion (HK$12.37 billion) 
coal-fired operation in Pangasinan province. He said he would 
consider avoiding China if the issue on capped returns could not 
be resolved. "I don't think I can change the mind of the 
Chinese people and so I would say it could be better to back 
off," he said. He added that he was unlikely to be alone in his 
thinking about power developments on the mainland. 
  CEPA was spun off from the Hopewell group earlier this year 
with plans to invest and develop power projects throughout Asia, 
but particularly in China. The group has announced plans to 
build several operations on the mainland. It has signed letters 
of intent to build power facilities in Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong 
and Shenzhen and has a preliminary agreement on building a power 
plant in Guangxi. 
  CEPA's development in the Philippines is scheduled to be 
commissioned by 1996. President Fidel Ramos was at yesterday's 
ground-breaking ceremony and said that plans were in the 
pipeline for CEPA to build more power plants under the 
Philippines' build, operate and transfer (BOT) scheme.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "It Is Essentially a Challenge to China's </F>
Sovereignty--Further on the Report Issued by the British 
Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee"] 
  [Text] An experienced member of parliament from the 
British Labor Party criticized the British Parliamentary Foreign 
Affairs Committee's report on Sino-British relations as "sheer 
nonsense." 
  This is absolutely true. One example is that the report 
attacks Article 18 and Article 158 of the Basic Law as "a 
serious hidden threat to the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the implementation of the 
Joint Declaration." 
  The spokesman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
National People's Congress (NPC) replied to this, pointing out 
that these provisions of the Basic Law were a concrete 
expression of the Chinese Government resumption of the exercise 
of sovereignty on 1 July 1997. It was totally unreasonable for 
the report to attack these provisions. Such an attack precisely 
reveals the real motive behind the British side's attempt to 
extend Britain's control and influence over Hong Kong. 
  Article 18 of the Basic Law states: In the event that the 
Standing Committee of the NPC decides to declare a state of war 
or, due to turmoil within the HKSAR which endangers national 
unity or security and is beyond the control of the government of 
the Region, decides that the Region is in a state of emergency, 
the Central People's Government may issue an order applying the 
relevant national laws in the Region. 
  Article 158 states: The power of interpretation of this Law 
shall be vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC. 
  The importance of these provisions to realizing and 
safeguarding China's sovereignty is self-evident. 
  China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong in 1997 is not just a matter of changing flags. The HKSAR, 
which will be directly under the Central People's Government, 
must be established in accordance with the decision of the NPC; 
the Basic Law of the HKSAR approved by the NPC must be 
implemented; foreign affairs must be administered by the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs; national defense must be the 
responsibility of the Central People's Government; the chief 
executive and principal officials of the executive organs of the 
HKSAR must be appointed by the Central People's Government; the 
declaration of a state of emergency of the HKSAR must be decided 
by the NPC; and the power of interpretation of the Basic Law 
must be vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC. All these 
represent the expression of China's resumption of the exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong and are also an expression of the 
principle of integrating upholding the country's unity with 
ensuring a high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR. The NPC is the 
highest organ of state power, and it exercises state sovereignty 
in a unified manner. China's resumption of the exercise of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong will inevitably be reflected in the 
participation of the NPC and its Standing Committee in the 
handling of Hong Kong affairs. How can we talk about upholding 
the principle of sovereignty if the NPC and its Standing 
Committee cannot exercise even the power of declaring a state of 
emergency in Hong Kong or the power of interpreting the Basic 
Law? Britain is opposed to these two articles of the Basic Law. 
Is this not a brazen challenge to China's sovereignty? 
  We really cannot understand why the NPC's possession of 
these 
two kinds of power can constitute a "serious threat" to the 
HKSAR. Suppose the NPC declares a state of emergency in the 
HKSAR because the Region is threatened by war, or by reason of 
turmoil within the Region which endangers national unity or 
security and is beyond the control of the government of the 
Region, and this enables Hong Kong to avoid aggression and 
ensures the unity and security of the state -- does this 
represent a "serious threat?" If some people attempt to tamper 
with or distort the meaning of the provisions of the Basic Law 
and attempt to create chaos in Hong Kong, and the NPC Standing 
Committee interprets the relevant provisions in order to ensure 
the correct implementation of the Basic Law, does this represent 
a "serious threat?" The right to enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy is invested in the HKSAR by the NPC, and this can be 
realized only if the Basic Law approved by the NPC is correctly 
implemented. According to the report, Britain, which is opposed 
to the Basic Law, seems to have become the defender of the 
HKSAR's autonomy, while the Chinese NPC, which resolutely wants 
to implement the Basic Law, seems to constitute a "threat" to 
this autonomy. Has anyone ever heard such logic? 
  That the NPC exercises the two kinds of power mentioned 
above 
is entirely a guarantee of the realization of "one country, two 
systems" and is a guarantee for the prosperity and stability of 
Hong Kong. To the several million Hong Kong residents who love 
their country and Hong Kong, this can only produce a "sense of 
stability" and a "sense of security," and will not produce any 
"sense of threat." 
  Only the following types of people will have a sense of 
"threat" and even "serious threat": People who have all along 
been opposed to the Basic Law and who intentionally attempt to 
tamper with or distort the Basic Law; people who hope that Hong 
Kong will become an "independent" or "semi-independent" 
political entity; and people who are "opposed to anything put 
forward by China" and who are dead set on regarding China as 
their enemy. As a matter of fact, these kinds of people can be 
put under one category, a category of people who willingly 
grovel at the feet of the British and serve the colonial rule. 
The number of people in this category is not large. That the 
NPC exercises the two kinds of power mentioned above will 
certainly constitute an enormous obstacle to their perverse 
acts, and, therefore, this will naturally cause a sense of 
"serious threat" among them. When the British parliamentary 
report attacks the Basic Law, it is absolutely speaking for 
these people, and the motive is evident. 
  When the Basic Law was approved by the NPC, the British 
Foreign Ministry made a statement saying that the Basic Law was 
an important milestone in Hong Kong's future, it reflected the 
spirit of the Joint Declaration, and was welcomed as a 
constitution. Only four years have passed, and the Basic Law 
has not yet been implemented, but Britain has changed from 
"praising" the Basic Law to opposing it. Chris Patten, who kept 
on saying that he "read the Basic Law more often than the 
Bible," also said a few days ago that Britain pointed out long 
ago that the Basic Law was harmful to the Joint Declaration. 
What does that mean? Did Britain say one thing and mean 
another in the past or is it playing tricks today? Either 
alternative shows Britain's hypocrisy and ulterior motives.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What is Hidden Behind `Human Rights'? -- Third </F>
Commentary on the Report by the British Parliamentary Foreign 
Affairs Committee"] 
  [Text] The report by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
British Parliament attacked China's human rights status on their 
own fabricated grounds, alleging that "Hong Kong's human rights 
will probably deteriorate after 1997. It then proposed that the 
Hong Kong Government set up a "human rights commission" and a 
"human rights supervisory institution" and "guarantee that Hong 
Kong will continue to enjoy basic human rights after the 
transfer of sovereignty." The Foreign Affairs Committee 
chairman even advocated exerting international pressure on China 
on the question of human rights and asked the British Government 
and the UN Human Rights Commission to "jointly supervise 
progress in Hong Kong's human rights status after 1997." 
  It seems that Britain wishes to act as a "human rights 
guard" 
for Hong Kong! 
  Honestly speaking, the fact that Britain talks about human 
rights and claims to be a "human rights guard" before China and 
before the Hong Kong people will only add one more little joke 
to the world. 
  Racism and colonialism are the opponents of human rights. 
When a place is ruled by racism and colonialism, its human 
rights are trampled on. This has been proved by numerous facts 
around the world. Britain has exercised colonial rule in so 
many countries and regions! It has deprived so many people of 
their rights and civil liberties! 
  Britain used gunboats to seize Hong Kong from China 150 
years 
ago. Even today, it still rules this place with colonialist 
practices and infringes upon the rights of the Hong Kong people. 
  In the 1880's and during the early part of this century, 
Britain carried out two armed invasions of China's Tibet, 
inflicting a very great loss on the Tibetan people. Moreover, 
it instigated the reactionary elements of Tibet's upper level to 
rebel and massacred the patriotic people. 
  This is Britain's human rights record. What a sordid tale! 
  Back home in Britain, different races have not achieved 
equality either, as some Hong Kong people have pointed out, and 
not all of the International Labor Agreements are observed. On 
this basis alone, there is no way that we can say that Britain 
has a good human rights record. 
  Isn't it ridiculous that Britain today has gone so far as to 
vilify China -- which does not have a single soldier in another 
country and which is making remarkable achievements in the 
protection and improvement of human rights at home! 
  Hong Kong needs human rights. Its human rights can only be 
really guaranteed after Britain pulls out, after colonial rule 
ends, and when the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region -- 
which will be ruled by the Hong Kong people and which will have 
a high degree of autonomy -- is established. The Basic Law has 
detailed provisions regarding the rights and freedoms to be 
enjoyed by the Hong Kong people after Hong Kong has reverted to 
the motherland. In the Chapter on the Fundamental Rights and 
Duties of the Residents alone, there are 11 articles which deal 
with freedoms. The scope of rights is so wide and the degree of 
freedom is so large that they are rarely seen in the world. 
  Taking advantage of the Wei Jingsheng and Xi Yang incidents, 
which judicial organs have already dealt with in accordance with 
the law, however, Britain has invented the lie that "Hong Kong's 
human rights status will probably deteriorate after 1997" and 
has invented Hong Kong people's "worries" over the future. If 
Britain uses this as a basis for setting up a "human rights 
commission" and a "human rights supervisory institute" before 
1997, then people have reason to believe that the motive behind 
Britain's advocacy for establishing such institutions is to 
protect those people -- like those already sentenced by China -- 
who pry into and steal state military information and economic 
secrets and endanger national security and national interests 
and to build a shelter for a small number of anglophile and 
anti-Chinese elements who are hostile to China and who are 
creating confusion in Hong Kong. 
  Therefore, as the "proposal" was advanced, leaders of the 
United Democrats -- Christine Loh Kung-wai, and the like -- were 
immediately overjoyed. They claimed it "conforms to the overall 
interests of the community" and "will enable Hong Kong people to 
have more confidence in the future." They then urged the 
government to set up human rights institutions as soon as 
possible and "compile a report for the United Nations." They 
and some others advocated drawing up an information freedom 
regulations bill and a human rights and equal opportunity 
commission regulations bill and urged the Hong Kong Government 
to step up its revision of such laws and regulations as the 
Press Freedom Regulations, the Official Secrets Act, and the 
Public Security Regulations so that their restrictions can be 
relaxed, thus offering legal protection to some who go against 
China and create confusion and make trouble in Hong Kong. 
  Some people from the Hong Kong community pointed out: 
Britain has never done anything to improve Hong Kong's human 
rights status during its colonial rule for the past one and a 
half centuries. Now Britain is playing "human rights politics" 
when Hong Kong is about to revert to the motherland. They 
argued that Britain is not doing this out of good intentions but 
in order to set up new obstacles for Hong Kong's smooth 
transition. Therefore, the Hong Kong people should be on guard 
against this ploy and must never be taken in. 
  Everything that happens after 30 June 1997 will be China's 
internal affairs, and no country can intervene. All major 
issues involving and straddling 1997 should be negotiated 
between China and Britain and must not be unilaterally decided 
on by the British side. This is a question of principle. The 
question of whether there is the need to formulate laws and set 
up institutions for the protection of Hong Kong's post-1997 
human rights in accordance with the Basic Law is the affair of 
the future Hong Kong SAR, and the British side has no right to 
intervene. If the British Hong Kong authorities want to "act 
independently" again by setting up the so-called "human rights 
commission" or "human rights supervisory institution," the 
Chinese side will surely not acknowledge them as it does not 
acknowledge the political system framework. As for 
international pressure, China does not fear it, and no other 
country is expected to follow Britain at its instigation.

"Motion on the Amendment to the New Territories Ordinance 
Should Be Shelved"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 27 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN 
SHE)--"Yesterday, the Headquarters for Struggle to Defend Homes 
and Clans" of the Heung Yee Kuk [township consultative 
council--an organization representing the interests of 
indigenous New Territories residents] of the New Territories 
held a mammoth meeting and a demonstration of indigenous New 
Territories inhabitants, and decided to stage a 10,000-strong 
protest march at Victoria Park on Hong Kong Island on 8 May. At 
the same time, "The Great Alliance to Safeguard the Traditions 
of the New Territories," an organization set up spontaneously by 
indigenous New Territories inhabitants, also is planning to 
conduct several protest activities. Thus is can be seen that 
activities of indigenous New Territories inhabitants to oppose 
the motion to amend the New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill 
show no signs of declining, but are tending toward gradual 
escalation. Various circles in society and the mass media 
universally hold that the motion to amend the New Territories 
Land (Exemption) Bill should be shelved in order to avoid social 
turmoil or a split among the people of Hong Kong. 
  The formulation of the New Territories Ordinance and the 
forms of property rights inheritance of the indigenous 
inhabitants of the New Territories have a long historical 
background. All previous Hong Kong governors have abided by the 
New Territories Ordinance and have respected the forms of 
property rights inheritance and other traditions and customs of 
the indigenous inhabitants. The Sino- British Joint Declaration 
and the Basic Law also give solemn commitments and guarantees to 
them. However, owing to the development of urbanization in the 
New Territories, the uses of much of the land have changed, and 
new variables have emerged in the issue of property rights 
inheritance. The Hong Kong Government therefore put forward the 
New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill so as to dispel doubts and 
misgivings in property inheritance of proprietors of more than 
300,000 residential and private houses in the New Territories 
without affecting the interests, traditions, and customs of the 
indigenous New Territories inhabitants. The New Territories 
Heung Yee Kuk and the overwhelming majority of the indigenous 
inhabitants were sensible people and expressed their 
understanding and agreement. The Heung Yee Kuk also reached a 
consensus with the Hong Kong Government. 
  Unexpectedly, when the Hong Kong Government submitted the 
New 
Territories Land (Exemption) Bill to the Legislative Council, 
Loh Kung-wei, an appointed member of the Legislative Council, 
proposed an amendment extending the scope of exemption in the 
bill to include village land. This was done without careful 
consideration and without first carrying out any consultation. 
The Hong Kong Government originally said it would not support 
the amendment, but later changed its mind and was in favor of 
it. If this amendment is adopted and implemented, the New 
Territories Ordinance will exist in name only, and there will be 
an impact on the traditions, customs, and legitimate rights and 
interests of the indigenous New Territories inhabitants. In 
addition, this motion is evidently in conflict with relevant 
provisions and commitments in the Joint Declaration and the 
Basic Law. It is even more difficult for the indigenous 
inhabitants to accept this. Therefore, it is quite 
understandable that the proposed amendment has caused strong 
resentment and protests among the indigenous inhabitants. 
  The crux of the issue is that the indigenous New Territories 
inhabitants' opposition to the proposed amendment to the New 
Territories Land (Exemption) Bill is aimed at safeguarding the 
continuity of the New Territories Ordinance and at not 
permitting any attempt by outside forces to change their 
traditions and customs. The former involves the long-standing 
commitments and administrative policies of the Hong Kong 
Government, and no change should be made lightly. The latter 
involves the issue of changing prevailing habits and customs, 
and such changes can be made only gradually, through 
consultation. The move by the Hong Kong Government to impose 
such changes on the indigenous inhabitants by means of 
legislation without any consultation is obviously unwise and 
wrong. It has caused disputes and chaos in the life and 
internal relationships among the indigenous inhabitants, and to 
a certain extent, has caused social unrest and a split among the 
people of Hong Kong. 
  The Hong Kong Government announced some time ago a delay in 
submitting the bill to the Legislative Council for examination; 
the reason given was to study how many existing regulations 
would be affected by the amendment and to study its impact. To 
date, however, the departments concerned of the Hong Kong 
Government have not yet solicited the views of the Heung Yee Kuk 
or the indigenous inhabitants, and the departments concerned are 
continuing to divorce themselves from reality and are acting 
blindly. Evidently, the escalation of protest activities by the 
Heung Yee Kuk and the indigenous inhabitants is caused by their 
worry that after its "study," the Hong Kong Government will 
cling obstinately to its course, force the amendment through, 
present a fait accompli, and compel the indigenous inhabitants 
to accept it.

  [Text] Taiwan's information office will stay when Hong 
Kong returns to Chinese rule -- but the name will be different. 
As of yesterday Free China Review (FCR) -- the island's 
Government Information Office (GIO) here, will be known as the 
Kwang Hwa Information and Culture Centre (KHICC). 
  Whether Taiwan will retreat after 1997 has been a concern in 
recent years. Although the ruling Kuomintang Government has 
repeated many times that it will stay, many believed some 
changes would have to take place to pacify the Chinese. 
  Political analysts have said Beijing would not tolerate the 
FCR, which contends the mainland is not free under communist 
rule. But Susie Chiang, director of the FCR and also the KHICC, 
dismissed claims that giving the organisation a new name meant a 
lower profile in the run-up to 1997. She said the centre had 
expanded its size and functions. 
  Originally housed in Central premises of only 300 square 
feet, the two-in-one FCR and KHICC has been relocated to 
expensive Pacific Place, Admiralty, with more than 1,000 square 
feet of accommodation. In addition to providing information, the 
centre now has a gallery, a conference hall and a library. 
  Ms Chiang, also a member of Taiwan's National Assembly, said 
there was resistance to its expansion. "Beijing wants us to 
keep a low profile," she said. "Before we moved to the present 
venue, we had already been functioning as an information and 
cultural centre. The new name is just to cope with our job 
description," she said. 
  At the grand opening yesterday, Ms Chiang vowed to stay 
after 
1997. "We are committed to Hong Kong," she said. "It is the 
meeting point between the two places across the Taiwan Strait, 
and its role will not change in the future." Taiwan's GIO 
Director General, Jason C. Mu, and 16 Taiwan legislators, also 
attended the opening.

<F P=106> [By Michael Bociurkiw] </F>
  [Text] Canada is threatening to use deportations and 
tougher visa conditions in a crackdown on entrepreneur 
immigrants who violate their visa terms. According to 
confidential documents from the Canadian Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration, a new "control strategy" hopes to 
cut down on the number of immigrants who come to Canada and fail 
to set up promised businesses. Once the changes are in place, 
it could become much harder to qualify as a business immigrant. 
Those who do will be subject to far stricter monitoring. 
  Entrepreneurs in British Columbia will soon be asked to 
allow 
immigration officers to review their tax files. "For deterrence 
to be effective, participants must believe that the chance of 
detection is high," the documents say, with "severe 
consequences". 
  The move is in response to widespread abuse of the 
entrepreneur programme, which allows experienced business 
persons to obtain Canadian citizenship in exchange for setting 
up a small business that employs at least one Canadian. In most 
cases, the business must be established within two years. 
  To cut down on abuse, Canada started issuing conditional 
visas in early 1993, but there has been little improvement. In 
fact, abuse has been so bad that in some parts of Canada 
immigration officers cannot locate many of the participants. 
Many of the abusers are Hong Kong immigrants. A few years ago, 
an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police found 149 
Hong Kong residents who were setting up fake businesses in 
Canada. 
  In order to drive home the point that Ottawa is serious in 
encouraging entrepreneurs to stick to their plans, it is to 
deport several immigrants who have violated their visas. There 
is no indication of how many entrepreneurs might be targeted for 
removal from Canada, but one source said 34 cases in the 
Montreal area are facing charges. 
  "In our view even a small number of successful removals of 
entrepreneurs...would provide a strong deterrent effect," the 
documents say. 
  Other proposed measures are: to take action against 
immigration lawyers, consultants and agents who "misrepresent" 
the entrepreneur programme, often by falsely claiming government 
approval or watering-down the programme's requirements; better 
overseas selection of entreprenuer immigrants-creating an 
"electronic file" on each entrepreneur immigrant; requiring them 
to submit progress reports every six months; requiring 
entrepreneurs to post a performance bond upon landing; and 
information exchanges with other organisations to locate missing 
entrepreneurs. 
  Most Hong Kong people applying as business immigrants go to 
Canada as entrepreneurs. 
  According to the immigration section at the Commission for 
Canada in Hong Kong, most of the business visas issued to Hong 
Kong immigrants are given to entrepreneurs. Of the 28,217 total 
landings from Hong Kong in the first nine months of last year, 
6,011 were in the entrepreneur category. 
  Even before the plan has been implemented, it is already the 
subject of controversy. A Toronto immigration lawyer, Mendel 
Green, who has been asked by Ottawa to help assess the business 
immigration programme, branded the plans "infantile". 
  "They should perhaps put their efforts to showing the great 
successes of Hong Kong immigrants in Canada as an example to 
others since the abuse is in such a low level," he said. Green 
said the Immigration Department had exaggerated the problem.

<F P=106> [By Susie Weldon and Rachel Clarke in Hanoi] </F>
  [Text] The Vietnamese consulate-general in Hong Kong says 
it has received an assurance that Hong Kong will not use force 
again in transferring Vietnamese detainees. The assurance came 
after Vietnam issued a formal rebuke over the violent transfer 
of 1,500 boat people from Whitehead detention centre to High 
Island on April 7. 
  In Hanoi, the United Nations refugee chief, Sadako Ogata, 
said forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people from Hong 
Kong had been suspended after the raid. 
  The Vietnamese vice-consul, Nguyen Thanh Thuy, said his 
country had expressed its concern in a diplomatic message 
delivered on Saturday over the level of force used. "We told 
them we don't think the use of force to transfer these refugees 
is necessary," he said. "We think it is better next time to 
inform the Vietnamese side." 
  Thuy said the Hong Kong government had not formally replied 
to the rebuke but had "sent a message". "The Hong Kong 
government told us this would not happen again," and "they would 
not use force" Thuy said. 
  The Hong Kong government's refugees co-ordinator, Brian 
Bresnihan, last night refused to comment on any assurance given 
to Hanoi over the use of force. Nor would he comment on the 
suspension of forced repatriations. 
  Speaking earlier in the day, Bresnihan said the Government 
had explained the reasons for the Whitehead raid. "We have had 
an expression of concern from the Vietnamese government about 
the use of force in this operation," he said. He said Hong Kong 
officials were "carefully considering" this message. 
  More than 200 Vietnamese were injured during the raid by 
1,200 police and prison guards. The Whitehead raid prompted the 
Governor to order an independent inquiry after Eastern Express 
revealed the number of injured was far higher than the single 
casualty originally claimed by officials. 
  Pam Baker, the chairwoman of Refugee Concern, said Vietnam's 
rebuke showed how far matters had deteriorated in the camps. 
"Treatment of the Vietnamese boat people is now so bad that even 
the country from which they are fleeing is complaining about 
it," she said. 
  A Security Branch spokeswoman yesterday confirmed it had 
briefed Vietnamese consular officials on the "events surrounding 
the Whitehead incident", and the recent appointment of two 
justices-of the peace to investigate it after receiving the 
rebuke. The spokeswoman declined to comment on the assurance 
that force would not be used in future operations, saying: "We 
can't go into the details of an exchange between the 
consulate-general and the Security Branch." 
  Security Branch officials would not comment last night on 
whether they had changed their policy on handling transfers of 
boat people in the light of the Whitehead violence. 
  In Hanoi, Ogata glossed over criticism of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees' inaction on the day of the 
Whitehead raid. She refused to speculate on what measures would 
become necessary once the dwindling supply of volunteers for 
repatriation dried up. "It will be a very difficult choice for 
all of us who have given very, very special attention to 
Vietnamese refugees," she said.

  [Text] The gap between heterosexual and homosexual 
transmissions of the AIDS virus is closing far more quickly than 
predicted and looks set to disappear within the next three 
months, according to a government specialist. 
  In the past quarter there have been 16 heterosexual HIV 
transmissions reported compared with only one homosexual 
transmission, narrowing the gap to just eight cases, according 
to Health Department statistics. 
  There have now been 157 HIV infections in the territory that 
were heterosexual transmissions compared with 165 homosexual 
infections. 
  In January, the Health Department's AIDS consultant, Dr. Lee 
Shui-shan, predicted that the heterosexual/homosexual 
transmission gap would disappear by the end of the year. 
  But in a review of the HIV infection pattern during the 
first 
quarter of this year, Dr. Lee said yesterday heterosexual 
transmission was likely to overtake homosexual transmission by 
the middle of the year. 
  "What we are seeing is a dramatic rise in heterosexual 
transmission of HIV although the important message is that this 
gap is closing," Dr. Lee said. 
  Last month four men and two women were found to be infected 
with the AIDS virus, bringing the total number of reported cases 
of HIV in Hong Kong to 435. 
  One new case of full-blown AIDS was also reported to bring 
the total to 100, 65 of whom have died. 
  "Although we are still seeing a steady increase in the 
number 
of HIV infections we are seeing an explosive increase in the 
number of AIDS cases as more people infected with the virus are 
developing AIDS-related illnesses," Dr. Lee said. 
  In the past quarter there have been eight new AIDS cases 
compared with only one in the previous quarter. 
  Dr. Lee said the number of deaths from AIDS did not include 
"several" people with HIV who had committed suicide. 
  The Health Department's AIDS unit is now setting up a 
community charter to tackle the problem of discrimination 
against HIV carriers in the workplace. 
  "Most of those infected are of working age and so there is a 
need to actively educate people not to discriminate at work," 
Dr. Lee said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Questions Still on PLA Troops"] </F>
  [Text] It was a tragic waste of what should have been an 
ideal opportunity to allay Hong Kong's fears about one of the 
most uncertain parts of life after 1997. 
  Ever since Chinese patriarch Deng Xiaoping overruled his 
Foreign Minister a decade ago, and declared that China would 
definitely station troops in the territory after 1997, there 
have always been doubts about what role they would play. Doubts 
which were only reinforced by the events of June 4, 1989 in 
Tiananmen Square. 
  No one disputes Beijing's right, as a matter of sovereignty, 
to garrison Hong Kong, just as Britain has done for the past 150 
years. The future People's Liberation Army (PLA) contingent has 
a legitimate role to play in everything from conducting air sea 
rescues to defending Hong Kong against outside threats. 
  But what is desperately needed is more information on what 
form their presence will take. More than 100 Beijing-appointees 
travelled to Guangzhou yesterday in search of that, on a 
long-anticipated trip they hoped would give them some idea of 
how the PLA is training the soldiers who will be coming to Hong 
Kong in 1997. 
  Instead all they got -- during day one of their two-day 
visit 
-- was a long lecture on the revolutionary role of the Red Army, 
the PLA's pre-1949 counterpart, and a glimpse of some army 
barracks. 
  Lectures on the Communist Party's past are the last thing 
that is needed if Hong Kong is to be reassured that the troops 
who will be stationed here will be a modern, disciplined and 
professional force. 
  Bland reassurances, such as local XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS 
AGENCY) deputy director's remark yesterday that "it's our own 
army protecting us: isn't it laughable to be worried" are not 
enough either. 
  What Hong Kong needs are some solid answers. What exactly is 
the training programme for the troops which will be sent to Hong 
Kong? How many will they number and who will be their commander? 
What part of China will they come from, and where will they be 
stationed in Hong Kong? Will they speak Cantonese and English 
and understand the local customs and culture? Some of these 
matters may become clearer, when the long-awaited Sino-British 
agreement on military lands is unveiled within the next few 
months. But most such details can only come from China. 
  The Beijing's appointees' trip is not yet over, it can only 
be hoped that today's concluding part of the tour of military 
facilities will be more productive and produce answers to some 
of these questions.

  [Text] Portugal's new "state secret law", approved by the 
parliament in Lisbon in February, was gazetted in Macao 
yesterday. Macao's Governor, General Vasco Rocha Vieira, was 
reported to have insisted that the Portuguese law be enforced in 
Macao. 
  According to the law, "documents and pieces of information 
whose knowledge by non-authorised persons is susceptible to 
putting at risk or causing harm to the national independence, 
unity and integrity of the (Portuguese) State and its internal 
and external security" fall under the state secret category. 
  For the first time in Portugal's legal history, the Macao 
Governor as well as the head of state, parliamentary Speaker and 
Prime Minister, has the power to classify on his own initiative 
certain documents and information as state secrets. 
  Civil servants and military personnel in Portugal and Macao 
contravening the state secret law face criminal and disciplinary 
proceedings. 
  The law states that the "protection of classified documents" 
was directed against "acts of sabotage and spying and leaking of 
information". A special parliamentary committee of the Assembly 
of the Republic in Lisbon is to oversee its implementation. 
  Portuguese media reports said Vieira asked last year for the 
right to classify documents in view of the enclave's transition 
towards Chinese rule from 1999. The reports maintained there 
was a need to protect Portuguese "state secrets" in negotiations 
with China over Macao "directly by the Macao Governor and not 
just through Lisbon".

  [Text] Macao, April 27 (XINHUA) -- A Portuguese-Macao 
joint venture will invest 500 million patacas (about 62.5 
million U.S. dollars) over the next five years in the setting-up 
of two air conditioning, ventilation and freezing equipment 
factories in Macao and China's Zhuhai Special Economic Zone. 
  A spokesman for the project said here today that Atecnic 
Macao Company Ltd, which is scheduled to be formally registered 
on May 2, would be responsible for the development of the 
project. 
  The two factories in Macao and Zhuhai will have an 
employment 
of about 200 and will offer technology research facilities and 
professional training schemes in cooperation with the Macao 
University. 
  The spokesman said that Atecnic Macao intended to achieve 18 
million Macao Patacas (2.3 million U.S. dollars) of turnover 
this year, adding that the figure for next year was expected to 
reach 95 million patacas (about 12 million U.S. dollars) and 
190 million patacas (about 24 million U.S. dollars) for 1996. 
  The Atecnic Macao company's output is mainly earmarked for 
the sales markets in Macao and China's mainland, as well as for 
exports to the European Union, the spokesman said. 
  The Atecnic Macao Company Ltd. has already applied for a 
5,000-square meters land lease to be granted by the Macao 
Government as part of its industrial diversification scheme. 
  The group Atecnic of Portugal produces air conditioners for 
household and industrial use, ventilation and freezing 
equipments as well as electronic security systems.

  [Text] Washington, May 2 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton told visiting Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua here today 
that he and his administration are willing to work with China to 
overcome the differences existing between the two countries so 
as to enable their relations to grow further. 
  In a meeting at the White House this morning, Clinton said 
that China is a very important and great country which has the 
longest history in the world and a most rich culture. Both his 
government and himself attach great importance to the 
development of friendly relations with China, he promised. 
  The United States and China, he remarked, should become 
partners of cooperation in their efforts to safeguard world 
peace and promote economic progress. "We are willing to take 
part in China's development program," he said, and U.S.-China 
relations should be based on sincerity and mutual respect. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, who is here on an official 
visit at the invitation of the U.S. Government, said during the 
meeting that China always takes a serious, positive and 
forward-looking approach to the Sino-U.S. relations. The 
principal objective of his current visit to the United States 
was to increase mutual understanding, promote Sino-U.S. 
friendship and develop mutually-beneficial cooperation. 
  He also stated that over a long period of time, China has 
made continued and unremitting efforts in order to improve and 
develop its relations with the United States. China sees and 
deals with this relationship from a long-term and worldwide 
perspective and it maintains that the two countries do share 
extensive common interests. It is China's view that good 
Sino-U.S. relations and the continued strengthening and 
expansion of mutually beneficial cooperation in various areas 
are in the interest of the two peoples and the people of the 
whole world as well. 
  Zou also said that Sino-U.S. relations are now at a crucial 
juncture. There are still differences existing between the two 
sides on some issues, but he insisted that their common 
interests far overweigh the differences. It is China's hope 
that the two sides should do more in seeking things in common 
and expanding their common interests, put an end to their 
disputes of the past as soon as possible, resume and increase 
the exchange and cooperation between them in various areas and 
open up the way to the future of bilateral relations. 
  Zou conveyed the regards from Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
and Premier Li Peng to President Clinton. Clinton expressed 
thanks for this and asked Zou to convey his regards to the 
Chinese leaders. He recalled that he and President Jiang had a 
very good summit in Seattle last November. 
  During the meeting which took place in a friendly and candid 
atmosphere, the two sides also exchanged views on other issues 
of mutual concern. 
  Ronald Brown, U.S. secretary of commerce, Anthony Lake, 
national security adviser to the president, Strobe Talbott, 
acting secretary of state, and Robert Rubin, chairman of the 
National Economic Council attended today's meeting. Also 
present were Zeng Peiyan, vice minister of China's State 
Planning Commissionn, Liu Huaqiu, vice minister of foreign 
affairs and Li Daoyu, Chinese ambassador to the United States.

(2806 0202 1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- More than 3,500 staff 
members and workers today [28 April] gathered at the Great Hall 
of the People to celebrate the brilliant festival of the working 
class and laboring people -- "1 May" International Labor Day. 
  Li Ruihuan, standing committee member of the Political 
Bureau 
of the CPC Central Committee; and Li Lanqing and Wei Jianxing, 
members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, 
attended today's celebration meeting. 
  The celebration meeting started with the majestic strains of 
the national anthem. Zhang Dinghua, vice president and first 
secretary of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, presided 
over the celebration meeting. Wei Jianxing presented a report 
at the meeting, entitled: "The Working Class Should Be a Model 
in Promoting Reform and Development and Maintaining Stability." 
On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State Council, 
he extended festival greetings and cordial regards to workers, 
peasants, intellectuals and other laboring people of all 
nationalities and to commanders and fighters of the Chinese 
People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police and public 
security cadres and policemen who have heroically defended the 
motherland and protected the people and the socialist 
modernization drive. He also expressed his high respects to 
model workers and advanced collectives which have made 
outstanding contributions to reform, opening up, and the 
socialist modernization drive. 
  Wei Jianxing said: Reform is the only way to make the 
country strong and make the people rich. It represents the 
interests and desire of the working class and people of all 
nationalities of the whole country and is the own demand of the 
working class. Only by carrying out reform, constantly 
liberating and developing the productive force, promoting 
economic construction, making all-round progress in society, and 
building China into a rich, powerful, democratic, and civilized 
country, can we continuously consolidate the position of the 
working class as the masters of the country and benefit the 
working class. The working class must consider reform as their 
own task, firmly support reform with perseverance despite 
difficulties, actively plunge themselves into the work of 
reform, and continuously push forward the reform work. The 
state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises are the pillar 
of the national economy. Only when we have successfully carried 
out reform in state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises 
can we fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system 
and establish a firmer material foundation for the working class 
and the broad masses of people to be the masters of the country. 
The working class should make its due contributions to 
deepening the reform of enterprises, accelerating the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system, and doing a good 
job in improving the state-owned large- and medium-sized 
enterprises. 

    Wei Jianxing emphasized: Both reform and development need a 
stable social and political environment. We have started a 
number of reform measures this year and taken a greater stride. 
The reforms, involving a wide range of activities, will 
inevitably touch some deep-rooted contradictions and encounter 
many unprecedentedly complex circumstances and problems. They 
will involve the readjustment of power and interest patterns. I 
hope that the working class will carry forward the fine 
tradition of taking the interests of the whole into account, 
proceed from the overall and long-term national interests, and 
make immediate, individual, and partial interests subordinate to 
long-term interests of the whole, so as to maintain social and 
political stability and ensure the smooth proceeding of reforms. 
  Wei Jianxing pointed out: One of our party's consistent and 
fundamental guiding principles is to rely on the working class 
wholeheartedly. In order to deepen reform, promote development, 
and maintain stability, we should carry out this principle even 
more seriously. Any thought or deed which violates this 
principle is erroneous. He said: In order to rely on the 
working class wholeheartedly, we must fully respect the role of 
workers and staff members as the masters of their own affairs, 
protect their legitimate rights and interests, and arouse their 
enthusiasm and creativity. We should seriously study new 
circumstances and solve new problems during the course of 
implementing the principle, and enact adequate laws and 
regulations to ensure the implementation of the principle. 
  Yang Xingfu, vice president of the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions, read to the meeting a "decision of the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions on launching among the workers and 
staff members across the country a campaign to learn from the 
`top ten outstanding workers and staff members of the country.'" 
Other speakers at the meeting included Bao Qifan, a 
representative of national model workers and deputy manager of 
Nanpu Harbor Affairs Company of Shanghai Harbor; Guo Linghua, a 
representative of national model workers and electric welder of 
Dalian Shipyard; and Feng Changgen, a representative of national 
model workers and professor of Beijing Science and Engineering 
University. 
  The following leading comrades also attended the meeting: Ni 
Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Lei Jieqiong, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, Peng 
Peiyun, Luo Gan, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Wan Guoquan.

  [Text] Nanjing, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman 
of the Chinese Central Military Commission, recently called on 
all soldiers and officers to carry forward the fine traditions 
of the Chinese Armed Forces and firmly March down the road of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  He also demanded that units of the People's Liberation Army 
(PLA) be further revolutionized, modernized and regularized so 
as to make new contributions to maintaining national defense and 
the country's socialist system. 
  Zhang Zhen made these remarks during his review of troops 
stationed in the northern part of Jiangsu Province, east China, 
which began on April 22 and ended today. 
  He said the fine traditions of the Chinese Armed Forces 
include the absolute leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, 
serving the people wholeheartedly, the powerful ideological and 
political work, strict rules of discipline, political, economic 
and military democracy at the company level, and the unity 
between the Armed Forces and the government and between the 
Armed Forces and the people. 
  Zhang urged officers at all levels to take the lead in 
carrying forward the PLA's fine traditions, to pass on the 
cherished heritage of the people's Armed Forces from generation 
to generation. 
  He particularly asked the soldiers and officers to carry 
forward the PLA's style of working hard and arduously in the 
present new circumstances. He pointed out that although the 
economy has been developed and the living standards raised, the 
tradition of hard work cannot be cast away. Building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics requires arduous efforts of 
generations of the people. Even after the country becomes 
strong and the people become rich, the spirit of working hard 
and arduously is still needed, Zhang stressed. 
  During his stay in northern Jiangsu, Zhang made surveys of 
grassroots troops, military schools, logistics departments and 
some military subareas.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 2 (XINHUA) -- A rational grain price 
is the core for the establishment of a grain purchasing and 
selling mechanism compatible with a socialist market economy, 
said Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji. 
  Zhu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Communist 
Party's Politburo, made the remark during an inspection of the 
agricultural situation in east China's Zhejiang Province from 
April 26 to May 2. 
  The vice-premier further explained that this grain price not 
only can help bring into full play the initiative of farmers in 
growing grain, but also can help lessen the difference between 
industrial products and farm produce, and urban residents can 
also bear it. 
  Judging from the overall national economic situation, Zhu 
said, it is quite necessary for coastal areas to promote 
agricultural production, and there are brights prospects for 
doing so. 
  During his inspection tour in Zhejiang, Zhu inspected grain 
purchasing centers, grain depots, grain shops, farmers' markets 
and the Grand Dike of Taihu Lake in the Hangjiahu area, visited 
several successful households specializing in growing grain, and 
listened to work reports of local officials, obtaining 
first-hand information about agricultural production, especially 
about the grain production situation and grain purchasing and 
selling system. 
  The vice-premier also toured factories to see workers who 
were on duty on May 1 -- usually a day of leave -- and chatted 
with some factory leaders. 
  Since Zhejiang province is one of China's important grain 
producers, especially the key grain production center of 
Hangjiahu plain, so grain production here can never be 
slackened, said Zhu. 
  "From the perspective of China's land resources, total grain 
output and foreign exchange balance, the coastal areas should 
never neglect agriculture after they become economically 
prosperous. They cannot become dependent for food supplies on 
grain purchased at high prices from inland areas or on grain 
imports," he said. 
  Active efforts should be made to probe into methods for 
carrying out agricultural management on a fairly large scale, 
said the vice- premier, expressing the belief that depending 
only on raising grain prices could hardly solve the problem of 
comparatively lower efficiency which grain growers face in these 
areas. 
  He spoke highly of Zhejiang Province's practices in helping 
local specialized grain production households in their 
contracted management. The vice-premier visited several such 
households, each managing 10 hectares or more farmland and 
earning more than those working in the local township 
enterprises. 
  He stressed that encouraging households to carry out grain 
production by contracting large stretches of farmland and 
developing agricultural management on a fairly large scale is in 
accordance with the household responsibility system and has 
proved to be quite effective. Therefore, it should be persisted 
in for a long term, he said. 
  However, concentrating land use rights in the hands of large 
grain growing households should be conducted on a voluntary 
basis, said Zhu, while urging the vigorous development of 
socialized services for agricultural production and giving aid 
to such households in the forms of agricultural machinery, 
pesticides, seeds, technology and loans. 
  The vice-premier focused his tour on the inspection of the 
grain purchasing and selling system. 
  He stressed that reasonable grain prices should based on the 
supply and demand in the market but the market should be under 
the supervision of the government. He also stressed that 
state-owned grain departments should keep necessary grain so as 
to play the role of balancing grain prices. 
  "Governments at various levels should adopt flexible 
measures 
to exercise management and control over the grain market, in a 
bid to maintain a basic stability of grain prices at the 
market," he said. 
  He said that grain deals and allocation between different 
regions should be conducted through market under government 
control. Unqualified wholesalers must not be allowed to enter 
the villages and fields to force up grain prices, he added. 
  The vice-premier also urged the arrangement of enough funds 
to ensure a smooth purchase of farm produce in the upcoming 
summer harvest. 
  Talking about the shortage of circulating funds many 
industrial enterprises now face, Zhu said that the State Council 
had made some adjustment of credit policies concerning 
circulating funds of industrial enterprises so as to alleviate 
the difficulty of some state-owned enterprises and promote the 
transformation of enterprise management mechanisms in these 
enterprises. 
  He believed that the problem of fund shortages would 
gradually be alleviated through concerted efforts of governments 
at various levels and enterprises themselves.

  [Text] Harbin, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Expansion of Harbin 
Airport will soon be started to prepare for the 1996 Asian 
Winter Games, official sources here said. 
  Preliminary designs for the expansion had been completed and 
approved, the sources said. Other preparations are either 
finished or under way. 
  The present airport of the capital of northeast China's 
Heilongjiang Province started operating in 1979. As the number 
of tourists has risen drastically, the sources said, it could no 
longer meet all the needs, and the opening of new routes has had 
to be delayed. 
  The airport lounges are to be enlarged to 60,000 sq.m. 
[square meters]. The plans also include building 155,000 sq.m. 
of parking lots, a new air traffic control center and support 
facilities. 
  The remodelled airport will be able to handle 6.6 million 
tourists a year by the year 2005. Destinations will be 
increased from 38 to 53 cities, including 11 cities in Canada, 
the United States, Japan, the Republic of korea, Russia and Hong 
Kong. 
  The 1.1-billion-yuan expansion work will be jointly financed 
by the central and local governments. 
  Major expansion work will be completed by February 1996, 
when 
the Asian Winter Games will be staged, the sources said.

<F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC 
committee, and Wang Yang, member of the provincial party 
committee standing committee and vice governor, separately led 
comrades in charge of various provincial departments concerned 
in visiting Hefei, Xuancheng, Wuhu, Fuyang, Huaibei, Suxian, and 
Bengbu from 13 to 22 April. They conducted investigations and 
studies on how to deal with new circumstances and problems in 
those localities during the course of reforming the fiscal and 
taxation system. 
  They pointed out during the visits: The reform of the fiscal 
and taxation system is one of the several major reforms this 
year, and it is of great significance to promoting smooth 
proceeding of other reforms and to keeping a sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic development. Leading cadres at all levels 
should seriously enhance their understanding of the importance 
of the fiscal and taxation system reform. The no. 1 men of 
party and government organizations should conduct investigation 
and study at lower levels on problems relating to local revenue 
sources. They should clearly know local situations so as to 
provide correct guidance for economic work. 
  Lu Rongjing and other leading comrades called on all 
localities and departments to actively adapt themselves to the 
new fiscal and taxation system. They called on all localities 
and departments to pay attention to the following several 
points: (1) It is necessary to adhere to the notion that 
development is the last word, make great efforts to further 
promote economic growth, cultivate new revenue sources, link the 
fiscal and taxation work with economic development, and increase 
revenues on the basis of reliable economic development. (2) It 
is necessary to enhance the awareness of economic efficiency, 
strive to invest the limited financial and material resources in 
industries and products of high added value and high economic 
returns, and truly make the improvement of economic efficiency 
the central task of economic development. (3) It is necessary 
to change the idea of helping enterprises by relying solely on 
reduction of tax payment and profit delivery quota. We should 
help enterprises enter the market to participate in fair 
competition. We should enhance the government's ability in 
macroeconomic regulation and control. (4) Importance should be 
attached to both increase of revenues and reduction of 
expenditures. It is necessary to improve the management of 
funds, particularly the extra-budgetary funds, reduce 
expenditure and promote the work style of diligence and thrift. 
We must resolutely overcome the bad phenomenon of being 
wasteful and extravagant while being financially tight. We must 
maintain a basic balance between revenue and expenditure. 
  During a discussion with local cadres, Comrades Lu Rongjing 
and Wang Yang repeatedly urged all localities to make efforts to 
study the new circumstances and new problems during the current 
reform of the fiscal and taxation system. The study should be 
conducted in a comprehensive, systematic, and thorough way on 
the basis of the preliminary study done in the preceding period. 
To build a leading force and work force that meet the needs of 
the fiscal and taxation system reform, leading cadres and staff 
members of various departments at various levels should be 
trained, either on a rotational basis or in regular training 
classes, in party or cadre schools. The propaganda departments 
at all levels should step up propaganda. The fiscal and 
taxation departments at various levels should set up a hotline 
for answering people's questions about fiscal and taxation work, 
accurately explain new policies to enterprises and families, and 
enthusiastically provide good service to urban and rural 
production units and businesses.

<F P=106> [By Xin Wenchu (6580 2429 0443): "Guangdong Provincial </F>
Party Secretary Xie Fei Delivers Important Speech at Provincial 
Propaganda and Ideological Work Meeting; Stresses Need To Use 
Scientific Theories To Arm Cadres, Attach Importance To Grasp 
Education of Teenagers, and Improve and Strengthen Propaganda 
Mechanism"] 
  [Text] The Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee held the 
Guangdong Provincial Propaganda and Ideological Work Meeting in 
Guangzhou yesterday. Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau member and secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC 
Committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting. 
Propaganda and ideological work, he pointed out with emphasis, 
has always been an important aspect of the party's work and is 
an important channel for implementing the party's policies and 
principles, uniting the ideology of the whole party and the 
people of the whole country, and realizing party leadership. 
Propaganda and ideological work play an important role in 
uniting, mobilizing, and encouraging the people of Guangdong to 
strive to basically realize the magnificent goal of 
modernization in Guangdong within 20 years. Party committees 
and governments at all levels, various trades and professions, 
and various units should attach great importance to doing a good 
job in the propaganda and ideological work in the new period and 
should make greater achievements in this respect. 
  The meeting was held in the provincial party committee 
auditorium yesterday morning. Zhang Guoying, deputy secretary 
of the provincial party committee, chaired the meeting. 
Provincial Governor Zhu Senlin, and Huang Hua, deputy secretary 
of the provincial party committee, also made important speeches. 
Wang Zongchun, Yao Siren, Zhang Hanqing, Li Lanfang, and Huang 
Hao also attended the meeting. 
  Xie Fei's speech was divided into four parts: 1) attach 
importance to and strengthen propaganda and ideological work; 2) 
educate the broad masses of cadres and party members with the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; 3) do 
a good job in giving guidance to public opinion; and 4) properly 
grasp the building of basic engineering in propaganda and 
ideological work. 
  The great practice of establishing the socialist market 
economy structure and developing the socialist productive forces 
with great efforts, Xie Fei pointed out, have provided a new 
impetus and favorable opportunity, putting forward even more 
important tasks for, and higher demands on, propaganda and 
ideological work. Propaganda and ideological work are faced with 
even more arduous tasks. The establishment of the socialist 
market economy structure urgently demands that propaganda and 
ideological work create a public opinion environment of 
enthusiastically forging ahead. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, Xie Fei stressed in his speech, is 
contemporary Marxism in China. Since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made 
his important remarks during his inspection tour of the south in 
1992, tremendous changes have taken place in the society, 
economy, and the people's mental attitude in our province. This 
is inseparable from the fact that various localities in our 
province have seriously organized the study of the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The 
establishment of the socialist market economy structure, the 
further liberation and development of the productive forces, and 
the speeding up of socialist modernization have put forward new 
and higher demands on our theoretical level, our level of 
understanding of policies, and our work ability. To meet the 
needs of such demands we must have a thorough understanding of 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
and be able to use it skillfully in practice. Leading cadres at 
all levels should, despite their heavy workloads, consciously 
find time for studying theories and should strive to improve 
their own ideological and political quality and to raise their 
theoretical level. They should be determined to get away from 
and reduce unnecessary social intercourse and should, in light 
of major issues of the reform and development of their 
respective localities and departments, concentrate their minds 
on the study of theories, read more books, ponder on problems, 
skillfully use scientific theories as guidance to solve problems 
in practice, and strive to raise their level in the art of 
leadership and other kinds of work. In studying the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics at present, we 
should mainly study the third volume of "The Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping." In our study, we should pay attention to 
properly settling the following issues: 1) firmly grasp the 
essence of the emancipation of the mind and seeking truth from 
facts and establish the Marxist world outlook and methodology; 
2) guide the broad masses of party members and cadres to 
seriously sum up the experience in reform and opening up in the 
past 15 years and strengthen the faith in taking the road of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics under the 
party's leadership; 3) strive to improve the ability to lead and 
control the socialist market economy; and 4. improve study 
methods, widen channels of study, and uphold the style of study 
of linking theory with practice. 
  Adhering to a correct public opinion guidance is to adhere 
to the party's basic line, properly propagandize the party's 
line, policies, and principles, and strive to arouse the 
enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and to guide them toward 
the realization of modernization, said Xie Fei. Our public 
opinion should be conducive to: Furthering reform and opening 
up, the establishment of the socialist market economy structure, 
and the development of the social productive forces; encouraging 
and urging the people to do arduous pioneering work and to blaze 
new trails in making the country prosper, the people happy, and 
the society progressive; helping the people distinguish right 
from wrong, to uphold the true, the good, and the beautiful, and 
to resist the false, the ugly, and the vicious; and conducive to 
the unity of the country, the solidarity of the nation, the 
easing of the minds of the people, and the social and political 
stability. 
  To adhere to a correct public opinion guidance, Xie Fei 
pointed out, it is necessary to correctly handle three kinds of 
relationship: That between healthiness of contents and 
liveliness in form--the two should be integrated; and that 
between positive propaganda and negative exposure--uphold the 
principle of unity, stability, arousing enthusiasm, and taking 
positive propaganda as the dominant factor, while exposing and 
criticizing things on the negative and dark side of the society 
and giving play to the role of supervision with public opinion 
but it is necessary to seek truth from facts, have a sense of 
propriety, take social effects into consideration, and pay 
attention to effects at home and abroad; and the relationship 
between social effects and economic effects. We must properly 
grasp a crucial point and that is, improvement of the quality of 
the journalist contingent. 
  To properly grasp basic engineering in propaganda and 
ideological work, emphasized Xie Fei, at present it is necessary 
to concentrate our efforts on properly grasping four aspects of 
work. The first is to grasp the foundation, that is, it is 
necessary to properly grasp the foundation of education for 
teenagers. Teenagers are the future and hope of the motherland 
and efforts should be made to properly grasp education and 
training for them and to develop them into a new generation of 
people with ideals, ethics, culture, and a sense of discipline. 
The second is to grasp the grass roots. Propaganda, 
ideological, and cultural departments at all levels should place 
the focal point of their work at the grass roots. It is 
necessary to carry out propaganda and ideological work and the 
building of spiritual civilization in the grass roots and to 
give full play to various kinds of organizational role for 
grass-roots party branches as a powerful fighting force. It is 
necessary to carry out in the grass roots various kinds of 
activities which are healthy and progressive in content, vivid 
and lively in form, and attractive to the masses and the 
contents of propaganda and education should be merged with such 
activities to silently exert a subtle influence. The third is to 
grasp the position. The construction of hardware for 
propaganda, culture, and spiritual civilization is the material 
basis for improving the quality of ideology and ethics and the 
quality of science and culture of human beings. It is also one 
of the marks indicating whether or not a locality is "grasping 
with both hands" and "grasping hard with both hands" and 
indicating the level of economic and social development of that 
locality. Various localities should include the "hardware" of 
propaganda and cultural undertakings into the overall plan for 
economic and social development and into the government annual 
financial spending budget and gradually increase the percentage 
of investment. The fourth is to grasp the mechanism. It is 
necessary to sum up the successful experience of various 
localities in our province since reform and opening up began, to 
meet the new demands of the development of the socialist market 
economy, and to further form, improve, and consolidate the 
following mechanisms: The switch-on and guarantee mechanism 
enabling party committees to strengthen leadership, governments 
to pay attention, and various quarters to participate; the 
mechanism enabling the comprehensive use of administrative, 
economic, and legal means to carry out management, regulation, 
and control; and the mechanism enabling the masses to govern and 
discipline themselves, to educate themselves, and to keep 
themselves within bounds. 
  Party committees at all levels should really undertake their 
responsibilities and earnestly strengthen leadership over 
propaganda and ideological work, Xie Fei pointed out 
emphatically. First, party committees at all levels should 
strengthen guidance and coordination in propaganda and 
ideological work, regularly study and analyze the ideological 
trends of various social strata, determine the policy, major 
tasks, and focal points of propaganda and ideological work in 
different periods, and give guidance to propaganda departments 
and help them discuss and grasp major matters and carry out 
their work in a down-to-earth manner. Second, party committees 
and governments at all levels should give support to the 
development of propaganda and cultural undertakings in terms of 
financial and material resources. They must implement the 
instruction by the central authorities that "taxes and profits 
handed over to the state by the propaganda and cultural system 
should, in principle, be returned to the system and should be 
used for the development of propaganda and cultural 
undertakings." Third, it is necessary to strengthen the building 
of the contingent of propaganda and ideological workers. It is 
necessary to show concern for their politics, ideology, work, 
and livelihood, give full play to their role, and constantly 
improve their quality. 
  The tremendous achievements made in economic construction 
and other aspects in our province since the beginning of reform 
and opening up cannot be separated from the hard work of the 
broad masses of propaganda and ideological workers, Zhu Senlin 
pointed out in his speech. The new situation has put forward 
new tasks for, and new demands on, propaganda and ideological 
work and propaganda and ideological departments have undertaken 
even more important historical missions. Under the condition of 
the socialist market economy, these departments should 
enthusiastically explore ways and means to do a better job in 
propaganda and ideological work, carry out their work in a 
creative manner, and better serve the reform, opening up, and 
economic construction of the whole province. They should, in 
accordance with the general goal and demand of basically 
realizing modernization in Guangdong within 20 year, make great 
efforts to developing flourishing propaganda and cultural 
undertakings. Governments at all levels should attach 
importance and give support to propaganda and ideological work, 
let the propaganda and ideological department know about the 
situation in good time, and try their best to provide better 
conditions for propaganda and ideological work so that it can 
produce greater benefits. They should include the building of 
propaganda and cultural undertakings into the general plan for 
the local economy and society, make overall arrangements, and 
construct in a planned way a number of relatively modern 
propaganda and cultural facilities which are in keeping with the 
economic development. They should, with the economic 
development, appropriately increase input into propaganda and 
cultural undertakings and resolutely implement an economic 
policy to support the propaganda and cultural undertakings. They 
should continue to encourage various social quarters to run 
propaganda and cultural undertakings and give them support in 
this respect. They should grasp prosperity in one hand and 
management with the other and make great efforts to straighten 
out problems existing in the cultural market. They should 
attach importance to improving the working and living conditions 
of the broad masses of cadres and workers in the propaganda and 
cultural systems. 
  Huang Hua relayed at the meeting the guidelines of the 
national propaganda and ideological work meeting and put forward 
views on the implementation of such guidelines. To implement 
the guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work 
meeting, he stressed, we must link them with the reality of 
Guangdong, grasp the key points and, in particular, make great 
efforts "to arm the people with scientific theories, to guide 
the people with correct public opinion, to portray the people 
with noble spirit, and to encourage the people with fine works." 
We must formulate plans, grasp typical examples, improve work 
methods, provide better services on our own initiative, 
earnestly do a better job in all kinds of work, and strive to 
attain good results. We must, Huang Hua added, earnestly 
strengthen the building of the contingent of propaganda and 
ideological workers, constantly improve their quality, and 
further inspire their enthusiasm to make the country prosperous, 
to forge ahead, and to make new contributions to opening up a 
new situation in the propaganda and ideological work in our 
province and to basically realize modernization in Guangdong 
within 20 years. 
  Also attending the meeting were deputy secretaries in charge 
of propaganda and ideological work from party committees in 
cities at the prefectural level, heads of propaganda departments 
of party committees of various cities and counties (districts), 
chief editors of party committee official newspapers from 
various cities, persons in charge of various departments and 
bureaus of the propaganda system directly under the provincial 
party committee, persons in charge of ideological work of units 
concerned directly under the provincial party committee, heads 
of propaganda departments central authority units concerned in 
Guangzhou, and representatives attending the provincial external 
propaganda work meeting, the provincial meeting of directors of 
cultural bureaus of cities, the provincial meeting of directors 
of radio and television bureaus of cities, and the Guangzhou 
City propaganda and ideological work meeting, totaling nearly 
1,000 people.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] The Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] yesterday [2 
May] formally replied to the mainland's Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] saying that the SEF 
will send personnel and crime experts to Hangzhou to study the 
Chientao [Qiandao] Lake incident [in which 24 Taiwanese tourists 
were killed during a pleasure boat cruise] 
  The SEF has decided that a delegation will leave for 
Hangzhou 
on 8 May with a scheduled return to Taiwan on 15 May. 
  The SEF delegation will be headed by SEF Deputy Secretary 
General Hsu Hui-you; and its members will consist of SEF 
officials, crime experts, and representatives of families of the 
victims, totally about 20 people. 
  The SEF indicated that the date of departure for Hangzhou 
was 
determined on the basis of the views of relevant experts and 
families of the victims and after assessing the situation. It 
hoped that ARATS would provide the delegation with the relevant 
information and make arrangements for personnel who handled the 
case and those who performed the autopsies on the victims to 
explain the incident to the delegation. The SEF added that the 
delegation will also visit Chunan County to (?inspect) the boat, 
the Haijui [Hairui], and will interview relevant personnel to 
have a thorough understanding of the case. 
  Meanwhile, according to Hong Kong's pro-Chinese communist 
paper, WEN WEI PO, Chinese communist Vice Premier Chu Jung-chi 
[Zhu Rongji], who is now visiting Chekiang [Zhejiang] on an 
inspection tour, has visited Chientao Lake to study the case as 
well as the measures the local authorities have taken to deal 
with problems arising from the case. The paper said that Chu 
has also instructed the local authorities to do a good job in 
receiving the SEF personnel and the victims' families. 
  The report also indicated that Chu Jung-chi's inquiry about 
the case shows that the CPC Central Committee attaches great 
importance to the SEF personnel's arrival in Hangzhou, and that 
it also shows that the CPC Central Committee is unwilling to see 
the boat incident undermine the developing cross-strait 
relations. 
  News reports from Peking [Beijing] also indicated that 
high-ranking Chinese communist authorities hoped that a lesson 
could be learned from the Chientao Lake incident, and that they 
have decided to set up a group to handle Taiwan-related 
contingencies. It is reported that the group members will 
include principal ARATS officials, and that the Chinese 
communist authorities hoped this new organ will be able to 
handle Taiwan-related contingencies efficiently and openly. 
  Commenting on the Hong Kong report that the CPC Central 
Committee has decided to set up a group to handle cross-strait 
contingencies, SEF Deputy Secretary General Shih Chi-ping 
indicated yesterday that the report, if confirmed, shows that 
Chinese communist authorities concerned have made a thorough 
self-examination after the boat incident. 
  Shih added that, in principle, the SEF agreed that a group 
should be set up to handle Taiwan-related contingencies as 
reported by the Hong Kong paper.

<F P=106> [By SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST political desk] </F>
  [Text] China's top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs 
yesterday hosted a meeting in Stanley of a Beijing-appointed 
local executive while still having had no official contact with 
the British administration since his arrival. 
  After a brief appearance at the Bank of China reception to 
celebrate the issue of new Hong Kong banknotes at 8 am, Lu Ping 
returned to the villa at No 6 Stanley Beach Road owned by XINHUA 
(the New China News Agency). 
  In a basement-level room with heavy red curtains, Mr Lu 
chaired the meeting of the political sub-group of the 
Preliminary Working Committee, the organization charged with 
speeding up preparations for Beijing's takeover of Hong Kong. 
  While Governor Chris Patten has ridiculed the committee as 
inconsequential, people within and outside the British 
administration have voiced their concern that it would appear to 
be China's power base in the territory. 
  Mr Lu, the Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office and secretary-general of the committee, 
only smiled when asked whether it would be a violation of the 
Memorandum of Understanding with Britain if he continued to 
dodge Mr Patten. 
  The memorandum, which dealt with the airport project, 
stipulated that there should be regular contact between the two 
sides. 
  One opportunity would have been at the Bank of China 
function, but bank director Wang Qiren said Mr Patten had not 
been invited because the organizers thought he was too busy. 
  "Mr Patten has such an important job to do as the Governor, 
we would not bother him with an invitation to the ceremony," 
said Mr Wang, former deputy of Mr Lu. 
  Mr Lu's meetings on political matters relating to the 
handover ended at 5.30 pm, and the whole group dashed off to 
Central to join their colleagues from the economic sub-group at 
a dinner hosted by the Bank of China. 
  Mr Patten was again missing from the guests, but two members 
of his Executive Council, Raymond Chien Kuo-fung and Tung 
Chee-hwa, were there.

  [Text] Expatriate civil servants have been shut out of an 
all-important meeting next week between the government staff and 
Lu Ping, the top Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong 
affairs. They have been given the cold shoulder by the 
increasingly assertive Preliminary Working Committee, which has 
set up talks between Mr Lu and representatives of at least five 
of the most influential groups for local staff. The Association 
of Expatriate Civil Servants was not invited, even though it had 
already lodged a request through the local branch of XINHUA (the 
New China News Agency) to meet Mr Lu, director of the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. 
  The most influential of the five local groups are the Senior 
Non-Expatriate Officers' Association (SNEOA) representing mainly 
middle-ranking officials, and the Hong Kong Chinese Civil 
Servants' Association, which speaks for about 90,000 local staff 
of all ranks. The chairman of the SNEOA, John Luk Woon-cheung, 
revealed that the invitation to meet Mr Lu had been made 
informally by officials of XINHUA. "We have been in good 
contact with the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, but it will 
still be good to see Mr Lu in Hong Kong," he said. The 
executive committee will meet during the week to decide what 
messages they will convey to Mr Lu. 
  Expatriate civil servants were disappointed that they were 
being left out of the talks. Governor Chris Patten has already 
been snubbed by Mr Lu, who has decided he had no time to spare 
in his hectic schedule. 
  Expats' chairman Royston Griffey said it would be 
unfortunate 
if they were barred from the dialogue between civil servants and 
the incoming sovereign power, because they formed a significant 
part of the administration and would remain so even after 1997. 
"It's important to break the ice in our relations as soon as 
possible," Mr Griffey said, referring to the lack of a response 
from XINHUA to earlier requests for a meeting. 
  Mr Lu's decision to meet local staff associations was 
further 
evidence of an effort by China to marginalise Mr Patten from the 
process of planning the government of the future Special 
Administrative Region. Mr Patten said on Wednesday that if Mr 
Lu's schedule was too busy to meet him, it must be too busy to 
meet any senior civil servants. 
  However, the Governor's spokesmen, Mike Hanson, said the 
Government did not feel that the scheduled meeting next Saturday 
was a further snub to Mr Patten. 
  Rather it was good for Mr Lu to hear all shades of opinions, 
including those of the civil servants associations. "The 
Government has no difficulty about these contacts," said Mr 
Hanson. 
  In Beijing, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office deputy 
director Wang Feng-chao again urged all civil servants, 
including expatriates, to stay on after 1997. He reiterated 
that only the principal official posts as defined in the Basic 
Law had to be filled by Chinese citizens. The other posts 
remained open to all.

  [Text] Washington, May 3 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said today that he does not wish to withdraw the Most 
Favored Nation (MFN) status from China. 
  "If we were to withdraw the most favored nation status from 
China, it would undermine what I hope to see in terms of our 
relationship," Clinton told CNN from Atlanta, Georgia. 
  "And it would be detrimental to the economic progress of 
China and to the standard of living which has come to so many 
millions, indeed hundreds of millions of Chinese people," he 
added. 
  The President claimed that what he had sought to do is "to 
find a balanced way for our two countries not simply to be 
partners, but to restore our genuine friendship" by trying to 
establish conditions that would permit that partnership and that 
friendship to go forward. 
  "Those are the criteria I set forward in order to continue 
the Most Favored Nation status next month," he said. 
  "I will say we have made real progress in our relations with 
China" in many areas, Clinton said, but "we still have a way to 
go." 
  He stressed that "I would work personally very hard to work 
out our differences so that we could go forward together." 
  Clinton also claimed that human rights is very important to 
the United States and there are some issues that the United 
States has an extra responsibility to stand up for: human 
rights, non-proliferation and other things. 
  "I am doing it in the spirit of genuine reconciliation and 
hope that in the next month our two great nations can work this 
out," the President said.

  [Text] New York, April 29 (XINHUA) -- An American 
industrial leader said here today that the U.S. Administration 
should renew China's most-favored-nation (MFN) status without 
any conditions. 
  Meeting a group of visiting correspondents from New York at 
the Otis Elevator headquarters in Farmington, Connecticut, here 
this afternoon, J.P. van Rooy, president of the company, also 
said that he and his company had been very supportive to the 
renewal of the preferential trade status. 
  "We will continue to make efforts to win the renewal," he 
said, adding that "neither the United States nor China can 
afford the loss of the status." 
  Otis, the world leader in manufacturing elevators for many 
years, has established close business ties with China in the 
last 10 years. In 1984 it launched the China Tianjin Otis 
Elevator Company (CTOEC) in Tianjin with a local elevator 
manufacturer and in the last two years it started three more 
joint ventures with the country operating in Beijing, Guangzhou 
and Shanghai respectively. 
  Van Rooy believed that human right issue is an internal 
affair of a country, and it had never affected his company's 
cooperation with China. 
  China enjoyed political stability, he said, and had 
decentralized its powers, thus providing a sound environment for 
foreign investments in the country. 
  "We are proud of our cooperation with China," he said, "and 
the Tianjin Otis has set a fine example for business cooperation 
between Chinese and foreign companies." 
  Last month, the U.S. Otis announced in Beijing its 12.3 
million U.S. dollars additional investment in the CTOEC, raising 
its share to 40 million U.S. dollars and its stake from 44 to 51 
percent. 
  "China is extremely important to Otis," he said. "And by the 
year 2000, the Chinese market is projected to be among the top 
three worldwide -- possibly even the largest or the second 
largest in the world." 
  His next plan, he said, was to have the four Otis joint 
ventures in China to form an Otis group, thus putting Otis in a 
much better position for the market competition in China and in 
other parts of the world.

  [Text] Washington, 2 May (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a 
gathering of businessmen hosted by the U.S.-China Business 
Council on the afternoon of 2 May, Chinese Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua, who is paying an official visit to the United States, 
said: International economic competition, as seen in fierce 
rivalry for market shares, has become increasingly heated. New 
opportunities and new challenges keep presenting themselves one 
after another. Under these circumstances, it behooves both 
China and the United States to seize the opportune moment by 
pushing vigorously for exchanges and cooperation in the fields 
of economy, trade, and science and technology. 
  Introducing China's current state of reform, opening up to 
the outside world, and economic development, Zou Jiahua said: 
Last year saw China's reform, opening up to the outside world, 
and modernization drive move forward rapidly. The gross 
domestic product of the year was up 13.4 percent over the 
previous year in comparable prices, and it was the highest 
annual increase since 1985. The rapid growth of China's economy 
has driven reform and opening up to accelerate and overseas 
investment in China to soar. In 1992, overseas investment 
actually used increased 160 percent and the figure in 1993 was 
up 91.5 percent over 1992. 
  He said: In developing its economy, China should rely on its 
own strength as well as on international cooperation. Opening 
up to the outside world has long become China's basic policy. 
Henceforth, China will keep unswervingly to the policy of 
opening up to the outside world. He quoted Deng Xiaoping as 
saying: China's opening up policy will not change this century, 
nor in the first or second 50 years of the next century. It is 
hard for anyone to attempt a change. China's door is sure to 
open up even wider and we will do a better job. 
  Zou Jiahua said: An all-directional pattern of openness 
linking the coast with the hinterland across China is taking 
shape. "We are ready to develop economic and technological 
cooperation and exchanges with all friendly countries and people 
from all walks of life on the basis of equality and mutual 
benefit." 
  He said: Cooperation can take many forms. We welcome people 
of insight to develop trade with China, but hope to see more of 
them come to China to invest and set up their own factories, to 
enter into partnership with Chinese enterprises or to transfer 
technology, and to jointly explore China's market. 
  He expressed the hope that foreign investment would conform 
to the requirements of China's general direction for economic 
development, adding that China welcomes investors to invest in 
the fields of energy, transportation, telecommunications, 
agriculture, and water conservancy for now and in the years to 
come. 
  Zou Jiahua pointed out: An outstanding feature of the 
changed international situation is that all countries have given 
their top priority to economic development. The Asia-Pacific 
region, by maintaining the best growth records for years 
running, has caught attention in the world. At the same time, 
international economic competition, as seen in fierce rivalry 
for market shares, has become increasingly heated. New 
opportunities and new challenges are everywhere. Under such 
circumstances, China and the United States should seize the 
opportune moment by vigorously pushing for exchanges and 
cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, and science and 
technology. This is not only in the fundamental interest of the 
peoples of the two countries, but will help promote peace, 
stability, prosperity, and progress in the world. 
  He said: In recent years, Sino-U.S. relations have 
encountered many difficulties. However, through the cooperation 
and efforts of business circles of the two countries, the 
bilateral trade, mutual investment, and economic and 
technological cooperation have maintained a powerful developing 
trend. In 1993, Sino-U.S. trade volume reached $27.65 billion, 
increasing more than 10 times over 1979, when the two countries 
established diplomatic relations, with China's imports from the 
United States up 20.1 percent over the previous year. The 
United States has continuously maintained its place as China's 
third largest trade partner. In terms of investment volume, the 
United States still leads other foreign countries. By the end 
of last year, the cumulative value of U.S. investment in China 
had totalled $11 billion, and the number of U.S. funded projects 
surpassed 8,000. Most of those investment items have achieved 
success and produced good economic benefits. Facts have shown 
that it is entirely possible for countries of different social 
systems and ideologies to actively develop economic and 
technological cooperation to the benefit of both sides. 
  Zou Jiahua pointed out: There are broad prospects for 
further developing economic and trade relations between China 
and the United States, and there is great potential in bilateral 
trade. Every year China imports from the United States large 
quantities of wheat, aircraft, computers, chemical fertilizers, 
cotton, paper, pulp, machinery, electronic equipment, and 
equipment for the chemical and petroleum industries. 
  He said: With the continuous development of the economy, the 
demand of China's domestic market will expand further. It is 
expected that from now to 2000, China will import $1 trillion 
worth of commodities. However, competition among various 
countries in the Chinese market is very intense. Advanced 
technology and equipment and fine service alone are far from 
enough. They must be accompanied by a long-term, stable, and 
friendly environment for cooperation in the economic and trade 
field. 
  He emphatically pointed out: The annual dispute over the MFN 
status indeed seriously obstructs [yan zhong gan rao 0917 6850 
1626 2371] the development of economic and trade relations 
between the two countries. The mutual granting of MFN status is 
the foundation for developing economic and trade relations 
between the two countries. If this is undermined, it will do 
harm to the economies and trade of the two countries and to the 
interests of their consumers. The governments of the two 
countries have the responsibility to encourage and support 
business people of the two countries to conduct mutually 
beneficial cooperation, thus creating favorable conditions for 
expanding economic cooperation and trade between the two 
countries. 
  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's speech was enthusiastically 
welcomed by some 100 people attending the meeting. 
  On 2 May, Maurice Greenberg, chairman of the national 
committee of the United States-China Business Council, met with 
Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and hosted a reception party for his 
Chinese guest.

  [Text] Washington, 2 May (XINHUA) -- In meeting with Zou 
Jiahua, visiting vice premier of the Chinese State Council, on 
the afternoon of 2 May in Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen said there are many points in common between the 
United States and China and hoped the two countries could 
establish long-term and constructive relations of friendship and 
cooperation. 
  Lloyd Bentsen welcomed Zou Jiahua's visit. He happily 
recalled his visit to China not long ago and said he saw great 
changes taking place in China and he gained a lot from the visit. 
  Lloyd Bentsen held that the United States and China should 
expand cooperation in various fields because it is not only in 
accord with the basic interests of the people of the two 
countries but also conducive to peace and development in the 
Asia-Pacific region and the world. 
  Zou Jiahua pointed out that the current level of relations 
between China and the United States are the result of joint 
efforts of the two countries. The two sides should cherish such 
relations. He said: Since the Sino-U.S. summit in Seattle last 
November, exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in 
various fields have made headway. However, the two sides should 
continue their efforts to further improve and develop relations 
between the two countries. 
  Zou Jiahua hoped both China and the United States would, 
based on the fundamental interests of the people of the two 
countries, gradually overcome their differences at present 
through negotiations, set their eyes on the future, and promote 
the healthy development of relations between the two countries.

  [Text] Washington, 3 May (XINHUA) -- U.S. Acting Secretary 
of State Talbott met with visiting Chinese Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua at the State Department on the morning of 3 May. 
  At the meeting, Talbott extended a welcome and greetings 
from 
U.S. Secretary of State Christopher to Zou Jiahua. The 
secretary of state has been on a tour of the Middle East. The 
Chinese vice premier in turn asked Talbott to convey his 
gratitude and regards to Christopher. 
  Talbott said: President Clinton's meeting with the vice 
premier yesterday has a positive significance for promoting the 
improvement and development of U.S.-Chinese relations. The U.S. 
Government has steadfastly observed the principles laid down in 
the three U.S.-Chinese joint communiques and has implemented the 
"One China" policy. The two sides have reached a common 
understanding on the importance of U.S.-Chinese relations. 
  He also emphatically pointed out that in its policy toward 
China, the United States has adhered to the principles of 
respecting sovereignty and of mutually beneficial cooperation, 
adding that Washington is pleased to see the determination shown 
by both sides to eliminate existing differences between the two 
countries to facilitate the steady development of U.S.-Chinese 
relations. 
  After the meeting, Zou Jiahua said: China has all along 
attached great importance to maintaining and developing 
relations with the United States. We are sincere in our 
attitude toward solving problems between the two countries, and 
have exerted and will continue to exert great efforts to this 
end. We hope that the United States will have the same attitude 
and take positive action to facilitate the normalization of 
relations between the two countries at an early date.

  [Text] Washington, may 3 (XINHUA) -- Acting U.S. Secretary 
of State Strobe Talbott met with visiting Chinese Vice-Premier 
Zou Jiahua here today. 
  Talbott welcomed Zou Jiahua to visit his country on behalf 
of 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who is touring the 
Middle East and conveyed his regards to the Chinese visitor. 
  According to Chinese sources, during the meeting, Talbott 
said that the Chinese vice-premier had a very good meeting 
yesterday with President Bill Clinton and this is significant in 
promoting the improvement and development of the U.S.-China 
relations. 
  The U.S. Government firmly follows the principles set forth 
in the three joint communiques and pursues the policy of "one 
China", the U.S. senior official said, adding that the two sides 
share the common understanding of the importance of the 
U.S.-China relationship. 
  Talbott stressed that the United States' China policy 
follows 
the principles of respect for sovereignty, mutual benefits and 
cooperation. He added that the U.S. side is happy to see that 
both sides are determined to overcome the differences now 
existing between the two countries and enable the U.S.-China 
relations to develop steadily. 
  In reply, Zou Jiahua said that the Chinese side has always 
attached importance to the safeguarding and development of the 
Sino-U.S. relations and has the sincerity of resolving the 
issues now existing between the two countries. The Chinese side 
has done much in this regard and will continue to do so in the 
future, Zou stressed. 
  The Chinese side hopes that the U.S. side will take the same 
attitude and active actions to promote the restoration of the 
normal relations between the two countries at an earlier date, 
Zou said. 
  The Chinese vice-premier asked Talbott to convey his thanks 
and regards to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, 
telling him that he achieved positive results in his mid-March 
visit to China.

  [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren expressed the hope here today that Sino-U.S. ties 
would be further improved and developed. 
  He told Frank Zarb, vice-chairman and executive officer of 
the Travelers Company of the United States, during their meeting 
that since the two countries play important roles in the world, 
the improvement and development of their bilateral ties would 
not only serve the interests of the two peoples, but also 
benefit peace and development in the world. 
  He hoped that the existing differences should not damage 
normal political and economic exchanges between the two 
countries, and that the differences could be solved through 
discussions and exchanges. 
  He said that the meeting between Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin and U.S. President Clinton in Seattle last year was 
beneficial to the improvement of bilateral relations, and he 
hoped that the favorable tendency of development could be 
maintained. 
  Zarb agreed with Rong's views and said that in the United 
States many people now enthusiastically hope that U.S.-China 
relations will improve. 
  Zarb and his party are here as guests of the China 
International Trust and Investment Company. 
  The Travelers Company is one of the largest insurance 
companies in the United States, with total assets valued at over 
101.3 billion U.S. dollars, and the turnover in 1993 stood at 
6.8 billion U.S. dollars.

4539 1795): "Nixon: A Statesman With Strategic Insight"] 
  [Text] At 2108 on 22 April 1994, Richard Nixon, a 
contemporary U.S. statesman with deep strategic insight and a 
former U.S. President, passed away at New York Hospital--Cornell 
Medical Center, after suffering a stroke. President Clinton 
announced the news in person at the White House Rose Garden two 
hours later, and ordered that flags over the whole country 
should fly at half-mast for 30 days to express mourning. 
  Richard Nixon was born on 9 January 1913 in Yorba Linda, a 
small town near Los Angeles, California. He graduated from Duke 
University Law School in 1937. During World War II, he served 
in the U.S. Navy and was sent on missions in the South Pacific 
region. 
  From 1946 onward, Nixon held the office of representative 
and 
senator, ran for governor, and was twice nominated Republican 
presidential candidate. For eight years, from 1952 to 1960, 
Nixon held the post of vice president under Eisenhower. He ran 
for president in 1960, but was narrowly defeated by the Democrat 
candidate Kennedy. 
  In 1968, he was elected 37th U.S. president. He was 
reelected president in 1972, but was forced to resign and leave 
the White House in 1974 because of his involvement in the 
"Watergate Affair." 
  During his six-year presidency, Nixon fully displayed his 
deep insight as an international strategist and his courage and 
resourcefulness as a statesman. His historic visit to China in 
1972 must be the most eye-catching event. In February 1972, he 
and Premier Zhou Enlai signed a joint communique in Shanghai, 
thus opening the door to U.S.-Chinese relations. 
  Nixon had great respect for Mao Zedong. Addressing a banquet 
during his first visit to China, he said: "Chairman Mao once 
wrote: `So many deeds brook no delay! The globe spins on, and 
time will not stay. Ten thousand years would be too long; let 
us seize the hour, and seize the day.' Now it is time for us to 
seize the hour, and it is time for our peoples to scale new 
heights." 
  After that, Nixon visited China many times. In the last book 
he wrote, he said: "Today, China's economic power makes U.S. 
lectures about human rights imprudent. Within a decade, it will 
make them rude [wu li 2477 4409] [Nixon's original wording is 
"irrelevant"]. Within two decades, it will make them laughable. 
By then the Chinese may threaten to withhold MFN status from the 
United States." 
  The "Watergate Affair" occurred in the United States when 
Nixon was playing an influential role in the international 
arena. So he became the first incumbent president in history to 
resign during his term of office. This was no doubt a 
formidable blow to Nixon. 
  However, step by step he finally returned to the political 
arena. In February 1976, he revisited China as an ordinary 
citizen. In 1977, he was interviewed by television reporters. 
In 1978, he started writing his memoirs. In 1981, he attended 
the funeral of assassinated Egyptian President Sadat, in the 
capacity of a member of the U.S. delegation. This was the first 
time he had attended an international function in an official 
capacity since leaving the White House. In the last few years, 
he paid special attention to international developments. Less 
than a month before his death, he braved severe cold to visit 
Moscow. 
  Several days before he was hospitalized, he received a copy 
of his last work, "After Peace," and he planned to read it over 
once again. Even before he fell ill, he was writing a speech 
which he was to deliver to raise funds for the Republican Party. 
  Nixon's death has shocked the world. Many national leaders, 
including Chinese leaders, have sent messages of condolence, 
praising this statesman's strategic insight and political 
courage. 
  Four living former U.S. presidents were highly appreciative 
of Nixon's political life. Gerald Ford said: "Nixon was, if 
not the best, at least one of the best presidents in terms of 
foreign policy." Ronald Reagan said: "His accomplishments in 
foreign policy will reserve him a high standing in history." 
Jimmy Carter said: "His historic visits to China and the 
Soviet Union paved the way for Deng Xiaoping's visit in person 
to the United States; and for the normalization of 
Sino-U.S.-USSR relations as well." George Bush said: "The 
difficulties he was faced with during his presidency may have 
shortened his term of office. But what we must remember are the 
many outstanding achievements he scored in both domestic and 
foreign affairs." 
  Former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger had the following 
comments: Nixon was in fact an idealist, but at the same time 
he was also a realist. He believed that idealism does not 
hinder, but rather, indeed, needs an understanding of the world 
with its true face. The analysis that lets ideals serve the 
world rendered him a man always full of vitality. 
  From 27 April, Nixon will forever rest at his place of 
birth, 
Yorba Linda. Four years ago, in the same place, when attending 
the inaugural ceremony for a library named after him, he 
summarized his philosophy of life as follows: "Failure is 
certainly sorrowful, but the greatest sorrow is the absence of 
both victory and failure in one's life."

<F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter He Liangliang (0149 </F>
0081 0081): "With Support From China, Create U.S.-Soviet 
Equilibrium--Nixon, Mao Zedong Cooperate in Breaking Bipolar 
World"] 
  [Text] Richard Nixon's strategic insight and practice have 
rarely been seen in the contemporary world, but Nixon was also 
the only person who was forced to step down from power for 
violating the law of his own country, although he broke fresh 
ground in U.S. diplomatic strategy. Nixon's impact on 
international politics remains indelible, not because he was 
involved in the "Watergate incident," but because he opened the 
door to Sino-U.S relations. Nixon's trip to China in 1972 not 
only changed international relations at that time, but also had 
an impact on the global strategic pattern in the last three 
decades of the 20th century, and even in the 21st century. 
However, the wishful thinking of one side could not achieve 
this purpose. In other words, if there had only been Nixon's 
wish and if the Chinese leaders had not had the same intention, 
there would not have been "a week which changed the world" 
(Nixon's own words). The most developed capitalist country and 
the most populous socialist country of the East shook hands, and 
the event shocked the whole world and disrupted the bipolar 
world marked by U.S.-Soviet confrontation arranged at Yalta. 
The world was thus pushed to a multipolar pattern, and China 
became an indispensable factor in international affairs. This 
was the historical significance of Nixon's visit to China. On 
the grand stage of history, Nixon and Mao Zedong played a 
leading role together; Kissinger and Zhou Enlai also played an 
important role. 
  Nixon mounted the political stage very early. He was first 
elected as a representative in 1946, when he was only 23, and 
was elected senator four years later. He was vice president in 
the Eisenhower administration for seven years, and a member of 
the power circle. During this period, he visited more than 50 
countries, and accumulated a good deal of diplomatic experience. 
In particular, he became famous for waging the so-called 
"kitchen debate" with Khrushchev in 1958. 
  In 1968, Nixon was elected as the 37th president of the 
United States. In the late 1960's, the economic strength of 
Western Europe and Japan grew very fast, and the military 
strength of the Soviet Union was even greater. The developing 
countries also began to rise on the international stage. The 
Sino-Soviet confrontation led to a split in the communist camp. 
China possessed nuclear weapons, and its international 
influence was increasing. Within the United States, the black 
civil rights movement, the student anti-war campaign, the 
women's movement, and the new left were in the ascendant and 
formed the most powerful anti-establishment mass movement in the 
contemporary history of the United States. There was also a 
radical cultural trend signified by the appearance of hippies. 
The U.S. economy in that period was bogged down in so- called 
"stagflation," that is, high inflation and low growth appeared 
at the same time. All of this caused a famous journalist, the 
editor-in-chief of TIME, to conclude that "the `American 
century' is on the decline." 
  When Nixon became the occupant of the White House, he faced 
a 
situation in which crises and opportunities existed side by 
side. Tenacious by nature, he liked facing challenges. At that 
time, the United States faced two diplomatic and strategic 
difficulties. One was its involvement in the Vietnam war, and 
the other was the expanding power of the Soviet Union. The 
United States' involvement in the Vietnam war, like its 
involvement in the Korean War, was aimed at checking a 
nonexistent "Chinese threat," but the United States did not win 
either of these wars. Although China's strength in those days 
was much less impressive than it is today, China still 
resolutely and indomitably resisted and withstood strong 
external pressure. China did not yield to the United States, 
nor did it yield to the Soviet Union. In the West, President De 
Gaulle of France noticed this first, and France was the first 
Western country to establish diplomatic relations with China [as 
published]. In 1969, shortly after Nixon took office, he met 
with De Gaulle. The French president told Nixon: "You had 
better recognize China as soon as possible, and you should not 
recognize China after it becomes strong." Nixon was deeply 
impressed by this advice. 
  In August 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia, and 
then provoked armed conflicts with China along the Xinjiang and 
Heilongjiang frontiers. The world's attention was drawn to the 
Soviet Union's expansion and hegemonism. After studying the new 
trend, Nixon found that Soviet threats against China showed that 
the Soviet Union had become more aggressive. If the Soviet 
Union carried out "surgical operations" against China, that is, 
launched a preemptive nuclear strike against China, then the 
global balance would be upset, and this would endanger U.S. 
interests. In his memoirs, Kissinger mentioned Nixon's 
strategic change and said: This was a "revolutionary theory" and 
an "important event in the foreign policy of the United States," 
because "a President of the United States had announced that the 
survival of a major communist country was of strategic 
significance for us." 
  The above-mentioned factors show that Nixon had changed U.S. 
China policy due to many considerations, but the most important 
consideration was the long-term national interests of the United 
States. That is, he tried to use the strength of China to keep 
a balance between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
However, the move also objectively raised China's reputation in 
the international community. In particular, China was still 
embroiled in the unusual "Cultural Revolution" period. This 
event also created favorable conditions for China's later 
opening. 
  The "Cultural Revolution" was a major mistake committed by 
Mao Zedong in his later years, but this does not mean that Mao 
did not make any major contributions to the country in his later 
years. He promoted the development of Sino-U.S. relations, and 
this marks a great feat of his in the diplomatic field. His 
meeting with Nixon was one of the most important and impressive 
diplomatic events of this century. The meeting marked the 
climax of Nixon's epoch-making visit to China, and made the 
seven-day visit "a week that changed the world." 
  Mao Zedong only made two trips overseas in his life, and 
both 
were visits to the Soviet Union. However, he was not unaware of 
the outside world. Modern technology allows people to know all 
about the world without going out of their homes. Mao was a 
statesman and a military commander, but he was also a great 
strategist. He had the talent to devise strategies which 
assured victory a thousand miles away while he sat in his 
command tent. He commanded battles against the United States 
during the Korean war, the Jinmen bombardment, and the Vietnam 
war. He also said that "U.S. imperialism is only a paper 
tiger." He was a master of dialectics, and he never looked at 
things from a rigid or inflexible point of view. Mao had strong 
interest in the revolutionary history, politics, and economy of 
the United States. In late 1970, while talking with his old 
friend, Edgar Snow, Mao again mentioned the U.S. federal system, 
and he also mentioned Washington and Jefferson. Then, he talked 
about the ongoing Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks in Warsaw. Mao 
said: "I am not interested in such talks any more. Nixon also 
has no interest. There should be face-to-face talks between 
us." "If he wants to visit Beijing, you may bring a message to 
him and tell him that he can come quietly in private. He may do 
this just by getting on an airplane. He may come as a tourist 
or in his capacity as President. I do not think that I will 
quarrel with him, but I may still criticize him somewhat." 
  Snow indeed brought this message to the White House. After 
that, with Mao Zedong's personal approval and Zhou Enlai's 
concrete arrangements, the U.S. ping-pong team visited China, 
and the small ball eventually moved the globe. The American 
athletes entered China on 10 April 1971 via Hong Kong, Lo Wu, 
and Guangzhou, and then flew to Beijing. Three months later, 
Kissinger made his secret visit to Beijing.

  [Text] Ottawa, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Bank of Montreal plans 
for an expansion in China to serve Canadian business there, the 
Canadian newspaper "GLOBE AND MAIL" said today. 
  Neil Tait, the bank's senior vice-president for Asian 
banking, was quoted as saying that the bank wants to upgrade its 
presence in China. It intends to convert the Guangzhou office 
into a full branch and to open a branch in Shanghai, he said. 
  "We would like to see more so that we can service the needs 
of Canadian businesses," Tait said, adding that "We believe that 
the Canadian banks have to be there on the ground in the market 
to allow Canadian business to enter China." 
  The bank's chairman and chief executive officer Matthew 
Barrett will meet Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji in Beijing 
this week to discuss the expansion plans. 
  Bank of Montreal is not the first Canadian financial 
institution to branch out in China. Last year, Royal Bank of 
Canada became the first Canadian bank to open a full branch in 
the country. 
  Tait said it is mostly small and medium-sized businesses in 
Canada that have an interest in establishing a presence in 
China. "So the banking system has to be there as a leader as 
opposed to countries such as Europe or North America, where 
businesses are larger and can enter those markets more readily," 
he added. 
  He said, the branches will initially be offering trade 
financing services to stimulate trade between Canada and China. 
Money markets and project financing will also be offered, he 
said. 
  China has hinted at a greater role for foreign banks in its 
booming markets. Hongkong Bank, with its affiliate Hang Seng 
Bank Ltd., has one of the largest networks among foreign banks 
in China, with 12 branches and four representative offices, 
while Standard Chartered Bank has 13 branches and offices. 
  U.S. and Japanese banks are also angling for a bigger 
presence in China.

<F P=106> [Article by "military researcher" Ping Ko-fu (1627 0668 </F>
1133): "Russia and China Upgrade Diplomatic Relations"] 
  [Text] Nikolay Solovyev (suo luo wei ye fu 4792 5012 4850 
0048 1133), director general of the Second Asia-Pacific General 
Bureau of the Russian Foreign Ministry and a former Russian 
ambassador to Beijing, said in an interview a few days ago that 
a consensus on the establishment of a "partnership relationship" 
had been reached between Russia and China and that this 
relationship was different from the strategic "partnership 
relationship" established between Russia and the United States. 
The new relationship established between Russia and China was 
defined as a "constructive partnership relationship." This 
meant that stress was laid on bilateral exchanges and regional 
cooperation. 
  Director General Solovyev held that two major factors 
threatened peace in Asia-Pacific at present, the first being the 
Korean Peninsula and the second the South China Sea. He thus 
indirectly rejected the possibility of a conflict between the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the new future. 
  Solovyev also said that he thought "alliance" relationships 
between countries did not tally with the norms of international 
relations today, because "alliances" eventually led to 
unilateral dependence between countries. [as published] 
  On the question of Sino-Russian military cooperation, Russia 
has international commitments and would never carry out secret 
weapons deals with China. Regarding the export of Su-27 fighter 
planes, the mainland has decided to buy a second batch of 26 
Su-27's. According to sources in the Russian Ministry of 
National Defense, talks on the export of 26 Su-27K's have 
basically been concluded, and the planes will be delivered in 
batches beginning this year. Compared with the 26 Su-27UB's, 
which the mainland has already obtained, the Su-27K can be used 
by both the Air Force and the Navy and are equipped with the 
AL35F turbojet and a digital autopilot control system, its fire 
control radar is of the same grade as the Su-35, which has an 
effective range of 400 km, and they can attack 15 targets 
simultaneously.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wang Genbao, Chen Yong: "Syria, U.S. Discuss </F>
Israeli Proposals on Peace With Syria"] 
  [Text] Damascus, May 1 (XINHUA) -- American Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, carrying Israeli proposals on peace 
with Syria, is now in Syria trying to revive stalled 
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, and is expected back in Israel with 
a Syrian response tonight. 
  Christopher and the U.S. delegation accompanying him held 
lengthy talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad here Saturday 
[30 April]. 
  They also had talks Saturday with Syrian Foreign Minister 
Faruq al-Shar' on ways of pushing forward the Middle East peace 
process and getting the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations resumed 
as well as on Israel's proposals and ideas about the peace 
process. 
  According to diplomatic sources in the Syrian capital, the 
American secretary of state conveyed to Syrian President al-Asad 
a collection of Israeli ideas and proposals aimed at pushing 
forward the Syrian-Israeli track of the Middle East peace 
process, which started at the Madrid Conference held in October 
1991. 
  The sources pointed out that Christopher, who had previously 
met with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, assured the Syrian president that the 
new Israeli proposals and ideas were considered serious, and 
that these proposals and ideas could be developed through 
bilateral negotiations between the two parties, which should be 
resumed as soon as possible. 
  The sources revealed that the new Israeli peace plan mainly 
includes the following points: 
  -- Withdrawing Israeli forces from the occupied Syrian Golan 
Heights at three stages over eight years; 
  -- Establishing full diplomatic relations; 
  -- Setting up joint borders; 
  -- Establishing economic ties between the two countries 
during the first stage of Israeli troops withdrawal; 
  -- Concluding an agreement on a set of security 
arrangements that include setting up demilitarized zones on both 
sides of the join borders, on condition that the one extending 
to the Syrian side will be deeper than that to the Israeli side; 
and 
  -- Stationing some U.S. troops and early-warning devices 
in the occupied Syrian Golan Heights, with the aim of ensuring 
the security of both countries. 
  The new Israeli peace plan does also include eliminating the 
Israeli settlements set up on the Golan Heights. 
  This requires that the bilateral negotiations should be 
expanded and joint military committees formed to determine the 
security arrangements, and that joint economic committees should 
be set up to study the question of sharing water resources in 
the Golan Heights. 
  The sources said that the Israeli proposals and ideas are 
not 
only concerning the future of the Golan Heights occupied by 
Israeli forces in the 1967 Middle East War and annexed to Israel 
in 1981, but also include the issue of South Lebanon, whose 
solution would contribute to achieving progress on both the 
Syrian-Israeli and the Lebanese-Israeli tracks of the Middle 
East peace process. 
  It was learned that Christopher showed Washington's 
readiness 
to dispatch a military force to ensure the security of both 
parties, pointing out that the Israeli ideas could be modified 
so as to fulfill the interests of both Syria and Israel. 
  The sources said that Syria showed readiness to get the 
peace negotiations resumed in Washington, making some 
reservations about the Israeli proposals and ideas, particularly 
on the lack of Israel's readiness to withdraw completely from 
the occupied Golan Heights. 
  Syria also made a reservation about the proposed Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights over eight years, suggesting 
that this withdrawal should be accomplished over three years at 
the most, and that Israel officially announce its recognition of 
Syria's complete sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 
  As far as the normalization of ties is concerned, Syria 
prefers that a complete peace should be established and ties 
should be normalized after the complete and final withdrawal of 
Israeli forces from the Golan Heights. 
  Syria agrees to the setting up of a demilitarized zone on 
the 
joint borders, on condition that such areas on both sides should 
be equal in size. 
  Syria prefers that the joint border areas should be 
monitored 
by UN observers, but it has no objection to American troops 
operating on the joint borders within a UN peace-keeping force. 
  On the situation in South Lebanon, the Israeli plan includes 
the following demands: 
  -- South Lebanon should be demilitarized; 
  -- The militias in South Lebanon, particularly that of the 
Hezbollah (Party of God) organization, should be disarmed; 
  -- Israel's rights to the South Lebanon water resources 
should be guaranteed; 
  -- The security of Jewish settlements in northern Israel 
should be guaranteed; 
  -- Some Lebanese Army units should be stationed side by 
side with a UN peace-keeping force in South Lebanon; and 
  -- Lebanon should sign a peace agreement with Israel in 
return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from South Lebanon. 
  It was learned that Syrian officials demanded that Israeli 
forces withdraw completely and unconditionally from South 
Lebanon in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 425. 
  As regards the type of relations and normalization, Syria 
prefers that this should be accomplished with a general 
Arab-Israeli accord, and that what applies to Syria should apply 
to Lebanon. 
  Christopher will leave here for Israel tonight, carrying 
with 
him a number of Syrian ideas and questions about the Israeli 
peace plan. 
  These questions are believed to include how far Israeli 
forces will withdraw, whether Israel is ready to withdraw 
completely from the Golan Heights, whether it is ready to 
shorten the period proposed by it for the withdrawal of its 
forces from the Golan Heights, what guarantees will be given for 
the implementation of an Israeli withdrawal within a period to 
be agreed upon, and how far Israel will accept the idea of 
setting up two equal demilitarized zones on the joint borders. 
  Although he emphasizes that the U.S. Administration is 
interested in achieving peace in the Middle East, Christopher 
argues that Syrian-Israeli channels should be opened and that 
the peace negotiations should be resumed with the aim of 
reaching a solution to fulfill the interests of both Syria and 
Israel.

<F P=106> ["News analysis" by Wang Genbao] </F>
  [Text] Damascus, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Syria has rejected 
Israeli proposals conveyed by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher Saturday on a phased withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East War and 
annexed in 1981. 
  Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' said at the end of two 
rounds 
of talks between president Hafiz al-Asad and Christopher over 
the weekend that Syria will not accept a phased peace with 
Israel and that it insists on withdrawal from all the occupied 
Arab territories as a precondition for peace in the region. 
  Syria's categorical rejection can be attributed to its 
consistent policy and stance of opposing unilateral deals and 
compromise settlements which, Damascus believes, can abort the 
peace process from the foundation. 
  Syria is also unwilling to repeat the Oslo experience. It 
contends that Jericho will never witness peace as long as 
Israeli repression and intimidation continues in other parts of 
the occupied West Bank. 
  It argues that neither Jericho nor Gaza or Majdel Shams on 
the Golan Heights are isolated isles but they are part and 
parcel of the Arab territories. 
  While renewing syrias commitment to the peace process based 
on UN resolutions and the principle of trading land for peace, 
Damascus makes no secret of its rejection of unilateral and 
partial settlements and comes out forcefully in favor of a just 
and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  It also demanded that the South Lebanon issue be settled 
through unconditional Israeli withdrawal in accordance with UN 
Security Council Resolution 425. 
  In addition Syria believes that a breakthrough in the 
current 
deadlocked peace talks is only possible after Israel stops 
derailing the peace process and completely drops all ideas and 
proposals for unilateral deals and phased withdrawal. 
  Damascus vows never to accept compromise deals over the 
Golan 
Heights and insists on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the 
Golan and other Arab lands. 
  Meanwhile, Syria has provided Israel with proposals which, 
it 
said, could lead to lasting peace. The proposals were brought 
to israel by Christopher Sunday [1 May]. 
  Israel's positive response to these ideas and UN Security 
Council resolutions related to the Middle East peace process 
could help in achieving peace, Radio Damascus said. 
  The Syrian proposal, it said, "emerges from a real desire" 
to 
establish a just and comprehensive peace that would guarantee 
the rights of all parties. Details of the proposal were not 
disclosed. 
  Christopher, who is shuttling between Israel and Arab 
states, 
said in Cairo today that "very considerable gaps remain" before 
a settlement can be reached between Israel and Syria. 
  He has indicated his readiness to return to the Middle East 
in two weeks to advance peace talks between Israel and Syria. 
  Christopher's decision is apparently based on the assumption 
that progress so far is enough to prompt him to continue his 
efforts to advance talks on the Syrian track. 
  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad told Christopher that he is 
ready for "normalization with Israel" at the end of full Israeli 
troops pullout from the Golan Heights. 
  "There is serious engagement, but there is a long way to 
go," 
a senior U.S. official said of the positions of the two sides.

  [Text] Nairobi, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The "interim president" 
of Somalia, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, will not come to Kenya to attend 
a proposed conference on the Somali crisis scheduled to open 
here on May 10. 
  In a telephone interview with XINHUA tonight, a high-ranking 
official of the United Somali Congress said in Mogadishu that 
the situation in Somalia, especially in the capital of 
Mogadishu, is very grave because the Habarghidir clan, where 
General Mohamed Farah Aideed is from, last month occupied Brava, 
Merka and the area around the Mogadishu airport which belong to 
the clans of Hawadle, Dir and Biimaal. 
  The airport is now under the control of the United Nations 
Operation in Somalia (Unosom). The official said "if the 
Habarg-Hidir clan does not withdraw from Brava, Merka and the 
airport area soon, let it get ready to fight with us." 
  On March 24 this year, all Somali faction leaders signed a 
declaration on Somali national reconciliation here after 
eight-day negotiations. The leaders agreed that a national 
reconciliation conference would be held in Mogadishu on May 15 
this year to elect a president, a parliament and form a 
government composed of all faction leaders. 
  Under the declaration, the faction leaders would hold a 
preparatory meeting in Mogadishu on April 15 for the proposed 
national reconciliation conference. However, the venue for the 
preparatory meeting has been changed to Nairobi, Kenya, for 
security reasons.

  [Text] Helsinki, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Finnish Prime Minister 
Esko Aho today met with Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC), to discuss ways of furthering friendly 
relations between the two countries. 
  Li, who arrived here Monday [2 May] for a goodwill official 
visit at the invitation of the Finnish Government, said that 
China and Finland, with a traditional friendship, have been 
enjoying sound relations despite the changing international 
situation. 
  He praised the Sino-Finnish relationship as a model of 
friendly cooperation between nations with different social 
systems. 
  The CPPCC chairman attributed the successful Sino-Finnish 
relations to mutual respect, frequent exchanges, cooperation 
based on equality and mutual benefit, and consultations aimed at 
seeking common ground while reserving differences. 
  Li said the two countries have tremendous potential for 
mutual cooperation because China is a developing country 
adopting a policy of reform and opening to the outside world 
while Finland is a developed industrial nation. 
  He hoped that relations between the two countries will be 
enhanced to a new level on the current basis. 
  Prime Minister Aho, who has visited China recently, was glad 
to meet with Li again and described his recent trip to China as 
a great success. 
  Aho was satisfied with the development of relations between 
the two countries, saying that Finland and China have succeeded 
in developing their friendly cooperation in all fields since 
they forged diplomatic ties. 
  Especially in recent years, he said, economic, trade and 
scientific and technological cooperation between the two 
countries has been boosted greatly. 
  Through a repeated exchange of visits, he said, both 
countries have also found a lot of common ground and reached 
understanding on many issues. 
  Helsinki is the first leg of Li's five-European-nation tour 
which will also take him to Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Belgium. 
  This is the first time for China's CPPCC chairman to visit 
these countries.

  [Text] Helsinki, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), and Finnish Foreign Minister 
Heikki Haavisto held talks here today on bilateral and 
international issues of mutual concern. 
  During the talks, Li said the two countries have made great 
achievements in exchanges and cooperation in the economic, 
scientific and other fields and China is satisfied with the 
smooth development of Sino-Finnish relations. 
  On China's foreign policy, Li said China pursues a policy 
characterized by independence and self-reliance with peace and 
development as its goals. 
  This is the first visit to Europe ever paid by China's CPPCC 
chairman and its purpose is to deepen mutual understanding, 
expand exchanges and enhance cooperation. 
  Haavisto said China's great success in economic construction 
has won respect and admiration from the people of the world. 
  "Finland hopes to further cooperate with China in various 
fields and take an active part in China's economic 
construction," the foreign minister said. 
  He added that Li's visit will deepen China's understanding 
of 
Finland, promote the friendship between the two peoples and 
boost economic and trade relations between the two countries. 
  The two leaders also exchanged views over international 
issues of mutual concern. 
  Li arrived here Monday [2 May] and has met with Finnish 
President Martti Ahtisaari and parliament Speaker Riitta 
Uosukainen. 
  He is on an official goodwill visit to five European 
countries -- Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Belgium.

  [Text] Beijing, 4 May (AFP)--Beijing on Wednesday slammed 
as "unacceptable" and "unfair" US threats of retaliation if 
China fails to take corrective action over violations of US 
patents and copyrights within 60 days. "It is unfair for the 
American side, in disregard of the tremendous efforts and 
positive progress China has made in protecting intellectual 
property rights, to threaten trade retaliation," a Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said. "This is unacceptable to the Chinese 
side," he added. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said in Washington 
on 
Saturday that China, together with India and Argentina, was one 
of the worst violators of U.S. copyrights. 
  "If a solution to U.S. concerns has not been reached with 
these countries within 60 days, or by June 30, they will be 
named `priority foreign countries' and investigations of their 
practices will be immediately initiated under section 301 of the 
Trade Act," Kantor said. 
  By putting off a decision until June 30, Washington has 
effectively separated the copyright issue from the controversy 
surrounding renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade 
status with the United States. 
  The decision on MFN, expected by June 3, has been linked to 
Beijing improving its human rights record. 
  While foreign countries welcomed the promulgation in 1991 of 
China's first copyright law, many have continued to criticise 
the authorities here for turning a bind eye to violations and 
failing to extract sufficient compensation in cases that are 
brought to court. However, the spokesman stressed that China 
had recently taken "major measures" to strengthen enforcement 
procedures. "China has already sent investigation teams to look 
into specific cases of U.S. concern and have rectified the order 
of some enterprises concerned," he said. 
  Vice Premier Li Lanqing said last month that China would 
also 
beef up patent protection by issuing a series of amendments to 
its 1984 Patent Law in the near future. 
  A government spokesman said Wednesday that China's top 
legislative body -- the standing committee of the National 
People's Congress -- would review punishments handed out to 
copyright violators in a further bid to curb "rampant" 
infringements. 
  While the 1991 copyright law has improved the situation, 
"piracy of books, audio and video tapes, and computer software 
has become quite rampant in recent years, in attempts to reap 
huge profits," the XINHUA news agency quoted Shen Zhengrong, 
National People's Congress spokesman, as saying. "This has 
affected China's foreign trade and cultural and scientific 
exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries," Shen said, 
adding that copyright violators should be severely punished.

  [Text] Beijing, May 4 (AFP)--China reacted strongly 
Wednesday to the U.S. decision to sell military electronic 
systems to rival Taiwan, demanding that Washington scrap the 
deal immediately. 
  "We are gravely concerned and strongly oppose the move by 
the 
U.S. side to interfere in China's internal affairs," a foreign 
ministry spokesman said, adding that the latest sales violated a 
1982 Sino-U.S. communique that called for the gradual reduction 
of U.S. arms sales to Nationalist Taiwan. "We demand that the 
U.S. Government strictly abide by the communique and immediately 
stop transferring advanced weapons or other military equipment 
in any form to Taiwan," the spokesman said. 
  The high-tech military electronic systems -- including radar 
and electronic countermeasure systems -- will be used to equip 
six La Fayette frigates Taiwan has ordered from France. 
  Announcement of the latest deal came after the U.S. Congress 
on Thursday voted to give President Bill Clinton the authority 
to boost arms sales to Taiwan, effectively relaxing the 
restrictions contained in the 1982 communique. U.S. firms had 
applied for permission to sell high-tech military equipment to 
Taiwan almost two years ago, but were turned down. 
  The spokesman said the United States had repeatedly violated 
the 1982 accord in recent years and accused Washington of 
seeking "to destroy the peaceful reunification" of Taiwan and 
the mainland. 
  Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war 
on 
the mainland to the Chinese communists in 1949. Beijing views 
the island as a renegade province.

  [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with the World Travel and 
Tourism Council (WTTC) delegation, headed by Jonathan S. Linen, 
vice-chairman of American Express, here today. 
  Despite the tremendous achievements over the past 15 years 
of 
reform and opening up, Qian said, China's tourist industry is 
still short of experience and needs to learn from countries with 
advanced tourist industries. 
  China is willing to cooperate closely with WTTC, Qian told 
the visitors. 
  WTTC is a non-governmental group, composed of about 70 
executives from aviation, hotel and railway industries, aimed at 
drawing government support for the tourist industry, sources 
here said. 
  The delegation came here to attend a tourism symposium at 
the 
invitation of China's National Tourism Administration (NTA). 
  Briefing Qian on the symposium, Linen said the delegation is 
impressed on China's tourist industry development and the 
world-class tourist facilities built in a relatively short 
period of time. 
  WTTC Chairman Robert Burns voiced his satisfaction with the 
cooperation between WTTC and NTA. 
  NTA Director Liu Yi attended today's meeting.

complete success. 
  In her meeting with the Chinese press based in New York this 
morning, Chen Muhua, president of the All-China Women's 
Federation, said that the preparation for the congress had been 
going on very well. 
  She said that she would like to extend warm welcome to all 
those who would participate in the Beijing congress on behalf of 
the host nation. 
  Chen, also a chairperson of the Standing Committee of 
China's

<F P=106> [Article by Su Jingxiang (1372 2529 4382) and Meng Danmei </F>
(1322 0030 2734): "Talks on China's Resumption of GATT Status 
Enter New Stage"] 
  [Text] The talks on China's resumption of GATT status are 
a major issue, about which people at home and abroad are 
concerned. When the GATT was established in 1947, China was one 
of the founders. After the founding of New China, China was 
excluded from the GATT. In July 1986 China formally submitted 
an application for the restoration of its signatory status. 
Whether or not China can restore its GATT status at an early 
date will affect China's political and economic structural 
reform and economic development. Apart from this, it also will 
have an important bearing on the final establishment of a new 
international trade order. 
<H5>  Reviewing the Process </H5>
  According to GATT provisions, China should go through seven 
stages in resuming its GATT status: 1) Submitting a letter of 
intent to resume its GATT status; 2) Examination and 
ratification by the GATT Council; 3) Submission of a memorandum 
on trade structure; 4) Examination by a work group comprising 
the representatives of the GATT Council member-nations; 5) 
Submission of a draft agreement on resuming its GATT status and 
the conduct of separate consultations with two-thirds of 
member-nations; 6) Signing an agreement on resuming its GATT 
status; and 7) Formally resuming its signatory status. 
  The first and second stages have proceeded very smoothly. 
China formally submitted an application to GATT in July 1986 
and the GATT Council readily and unanimously ratified it. China 
submitted a memorandum on its trade structure in February 1987. 
As the GATT Council varied in its views on whether or not China 
fell into the category of "resuming GATT status," it did not 
form a working party until May 1987 -- a date that indicated the 
beginning of the formal talks on China's resumption of GATT 
status. At the 10th GATT working party meeting in February 
1992, the talks on China's resumption of GATT status completed 
the work for the fourth stage. At the 11th GATT working party 
meeting in October 1992, "essential" talks were held on the 
agreement, and the talks are still under way so far. 
<H5>  The Cause of Obstacles </H5>
  Oksenberg, famous U.S. expert on the China problem, pointed 
out in 1990 that the talks on the agreement would be the most 
difficult job in the course of China's resumption of GATT 
status. Facts have proved that the talks in this stage have 
been more difficult and complicated than Oksenberg expected. 
There are many reasons. 
  First, GATT has never been a "pure" trade organization. Big 
powers usually decide their "tricks" in GATT according to the 
international situation and their diplomatic strategies. Facing 
the tremendous changes in the international situation in recent 
years, the United States, Japan, and the EC -- all occupying a 
dominant position in GATT -- have adjusted their China policies 
and thus reconsidered China's resumption of GATT status. 
  Second, in recent years some developed nations have 
constantly created trouble for China, such as disputes between 
China and the United States over China's most-favored nation 
status, the Yinhe incident, and arms proliferation; stalemate in 
Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue; French arms sales to 
Taiwan; U.S.-European joint action to impose pressure on China 
concerning the human rights issue; and so on and so forth. 
These large and small frictions have indirectly affected the 
talks on China's resumption of GATT status. 
  Third, the draft agreement on China's resumption of GATT 
status is based on the final document of the Uruguay Round of 
talks. Because the Uruguay Round of talks was postponed time and 
again, this directly caused a delay in the process of China's 
resumption of GATT status. 
<H5>  Speeding Up the Pace </H5>
  At the beginning of this year, China stepped up its efforts 
at the talks on resuming its GATT status. On 21 January, U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen visited China,and the Sino-U.S. 
Joint Economic Committee formally resumed its work after a 
seven-year suspension. On 20 February, deputy U.S. trade 
representative Dawkins led a delegation to China to hold the 
eighth round of consultations between the two countries on 
China's resumption of GATT status. On 28 February, Brittan, EC 
chief representative to GATT talks, visited China. The GATT 
working party on China will hold its 16th meeting [as published] 
in Geneva in April, and China will send a delegation to Morocco 
in mid-April to sign the final document of the Uruguay Round of 
talks. Viewing the initial results of the consultations 
between the Chinese, U.S., and EC representatives and the 
arrangements for future talks, we have reason to believe that 
the talks on China's resumption of GATT status have entered a 
new stage, and that it is absolutely possible for China to 
resume its status as a GATT "founder nation" before the 
Multilateral Trade Organization [MTO] established by the Uruguay 
Round of talks comes into effect. 
<H5>  Favorable Conditions </H5>
  On China's part, it is equipped with the conditions to 
resume 
its GATT status. 1) In 1993 China continued to deepen its 
reform and made major progress in this respect. The Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided the 
overall structure of the Chinese market economy and ratified a 
series of reform measures for the financial, monetary, taxation, 
foreign trade, and enterprise structures. In 1993 alone, the 
National People's Congress ratified 13 economic laws and 
regulations, including the Company Law and the Law Against 
Improper Competition, clarifying the main composition of the 
market, standardizing market behavior, and laying the foundation 
for entry into the market economy. 2) To cope with the 
difficulties created by the U.S. Government, China -- bearing in 
mind the country's interests and economic development -- took a 
correct attitude and worked hard to improve its relations with 
the United States. In January 1992, China and the United 
States, abiding by the GATT blueprint, signed a memorandum of 
understanding on protecting intellectual property rights; in 
August and October, the two countries signed a memorandum on 
prison-made products and market admission; and in January 1994, 
the two countries reached an agreement on textile products. 3) 
In 1992 and 1993, China maintained rapid economic growth and 
registered rapid foreign trade development. Thanks to the 
marked improvement in its overall national economic strength, 
China has the ability to perform GATT duties and also has 
strengthened its confidence in conducting consultations with 
other GATT signatory nations on some "sensitive issues." 
  On the part of the Western countries, China's resumption of 
GATT status will help boost their interests. In such cases, the 
obstacles to China's resumption of GATT status will diminish. 
1) China displayed its huge market potential in 1993. In the 
first nine months of 1993, China's trade with Germany, Italy, 
and Denmark increased by 90 percent, 83 percent, and 154 
percent, respectively, over the same period of 1992. In 1993, 
Japan's exports to China increased by 44.6 percent over 1992. 
In 1993, China absorbed one- tenth of the direct investment 
from around the world, thus becoming the second largest direct 
foreign investment recipient after the the United States. At a 
U.S. Congress hearing on 24 February this year, deputy U.S. 
trade representative Balshevsky said that the Chinese market had 
provided a "historic opportunity" for U.S. enterprises. She 
added that China will import $40 to $100 billion worth of power 
equipment in the coming 25 years, $40 billion worth of planes in 
the coming 20 years, $30 billion worth of telecommunications 
equipment in the coming five years, and $29 billion worth of 
automobile parts in the coming three years. As a "huge market" 
is appearing in China, many GATT member-nations indicated the 
urgency of allowing China into the GATT. 2) China has regarded 
the date for the MTO to come into force (July 1995) as the 
"final time limit" for its re- entry into GATT. If China cannot 
reenter GATT by that time, China will adopt a "bilateral" trade 
talk strategy in international trade. In this case, many 
countries are worried that there will be much trouble in 
entering the huge Chinese market. 
<H5>  Final Stage </H5>
  The talks on China's resumption of GATT status have entered 
a 
crucial stage of "bargaining." In February, China and the 
United States conducted initial consultations on a "special 
protective clause." This means that the United States is 
worried that after China re-enters GATT, its exports to the 
United States will increase by a wide margin and create market 
confusion. It therefore demanded the establishment of a 
protective mechanism. The Chinese side expressed its readiness 
to accept this clause conditionally (meaning there must be a 
time limit). At the 16th [as published] GATT working party 
meeting on China from 15 to 18 March, the majority of 
representatives explicitly expressed their hope for an early 
conclusion of the talks on China's resumption of GATT status, so 
that when it resumes its GATT status, China will become a 
founder-nation of the MTO, which will be established early next 
year.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yang Qing (2799 7230) and Li Xiaogang (2621 </F>
2556 1511)] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 1 Apr (XINHUA) -- Speaking at an 
on-site meeting on learning from and promoting Beijing First 
Light Industry Corporation's experience in carrying out 
extensive integrated reforms, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State 
Council, stated: Beijing First Light Industry Corporation's 
experience demonstrates that the difficulties facing state-owned 
enterprises are not insurmountable, and that state-owned 
enterprises can be invigorated and are not without 
superiorities; reform holds the key to solving these problems. 
Responsible persons from light industry departments and bureaus 
in 30 large and medium cities attended the meeting, which was 
held by the China National Light Industry Council. 
  Li Lanqing said: Guided by Comrade Xiaoping's important 
talks during his tour of southern China and the guidelines of 
the 14th CPC National Congress, and with the full support of the 
Beijing Municipal Party Committee and Government, as well as 
such departments as the China National Light Industry Council, 
the State Economic Restructuring Commission, and the State 
Economics and Trade Commission, leaders and comrades in Beijing 
First Light Industry Corporation proceeded from reality, 
explored new ways, and advanced the idea for carrying out 
extensive integrated reforms after giving full consideration to 
reforms of the systems of enterprise property rights, land 
utilization, personnel and labor, worker training, and social 
security, as well as the transformation of government functions. 
Those reforms led to "the appreciation of assets, industrial 
realignment, functional changes, the transformation of 
mechanisms, and the outplacement of workers and staff members." 
The corporation achieved remarkable results in implementing the 
idea internally, thus promoting its own development and 
improving its own economic efficiency. [passage omitted] 
  Li Lanqing noted: The reform measures embody the unity of 
realigned production relations and productive forces, as well as 
the unity of reform, development, and stability. They conform 
to the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, as well as this year's overall situation. 
The experience holds universal significance for carrying out 
extensive integrated reforms in small and medium state-owned 
enterprises, as well as in large collectively owned enterprises, 
in the light industry sector. It is also useful as reference for 
reforming and invigorating some large and medium state-owned 
enteprises. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Chen Jinhua, Minister of the State </F>
Planning Commission, Views Commodity Price Inspection"] 
  [Text] Just as the people of the whole nation are actively 
implementing various important reform measures, the State 
Council has decided to launch a nationwide price inspection as 
of the end of March, in a bid to use various comprehensive means 
to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control over prices 
and prevent prices from rising excessively. What is the 
significance of this? When interviewed by this reporter, Chen 
Jinhua, minister of the State Planning Commission, said it was a 
positive measure taken by the party Central Committee and the 
State Council to promote the establishment of the socialist 
market economic structure with the overall situation of reform, 
development, and stability in mind. 
<H5>  Practicing Market Regulation Does Not Mean Letting Things </H5>
Drift 
  Chen Jinhua pointed out: The general situation is fine, the 
market is brisk, and the public feeling is stable. However, an 
outstanding problem is the soaring prices. He said: This 
chiefly manifests itself in chaotic market price order, 
indiscriminate price increases, and indiscriminate collection of 
fees. Some enterprises have taken advantage of the introduction 
of tax system reform, exchange rates, and prices to drive up 
prices. For the sake of local interests, some localities have 
exceeded their own power in fixing prices and indiscriminately 
collecting fees. Some businessmen, disregarding the regulation 
on putting goods on sale with the prices clearly marked, have 
asked for exorbitant prices, sought staggering profits, sold 
fake and shoddy products, cheated people in the same trade, and 
played the bullyboy. To a certain extent, all this has 
disrupted the market order and affected normal production and 
circulation. The party Central Committee and the State Council 
have paid great attention to this problem. Since the second 
half of last year, they have taken economic, legal, and the 
necessary administrative measures to strengthen macroeconomic 
regulation and control over prices. The current nationwide 
general price inspection is aimed at pushing the implementation 
of various regulation and control measures further ahead, to 
create a better external environment for enterprises to develop 
fair competition, promote the change of operation system, 
improve operations and management, and raise economic efficiency. 
  Chen Jinhua stressed: In line with the requirement to 
establish a socialist market economic structure, the prices of 
the overwhelming majority of commodities and service fees are 
now regulated by the market. However, lifting price controls 
does not mean letting things adrift, still less does it mean 
refusing to have anything more to do with it. No country in the 
world takes a completely laissez-faire attitude toward prices. 
Countries practicing the market economy like the United States 
and Japan impose strict but effective controls over the prices 
of important commodities which have a bearing on the national 
economy and the people's livelihood and also over service fees. 
It is the aim of our party and government to serve the people 
heart and soul and it is the fundamental duty of our government 
to be concerned with the vital interests of the masses. To 
develop a nationwide price inspection and punish price violators 
is an important action in protecting the interests of the 
masses, stabilizing the people's livelihood, and maintaining 
social stability. 
<H5>  The Main Emphasis of the Inspection Is on the Prices of the </H5>
Basic Necessities of Life and Service Fees 
  Chen said: The price inspection this time covers all 
enterprises, small industrial and commercial businesses, and 
administrative and public institutions which collect fees and 
charges. It will inspect those price violations which have 
happened since the latter half of 1993 while serious violation 
cases will be traced back to the latter half of 1992. The main 
contents of the inspection are as follows: First, the action of 
taking advantage of tax system reform to arbitrarily raise 
prices, increase the purchase and sales price differentials as 
well as the wholesale and retail price differentials, and 
increase the prices of goods or service fees by adding value 
added tax rate to the original prices. Second, in violation of 
the price control jurisdiction, the action of arbitrarily 
raising commodity prices or service fees which should be fixed 
by the state; the action of arbitrarily raising prices and 
collecting fees in railroad, highway, and shipping 
transportation and forcibly asking people to purchase insurance 
when selling or handling tickets. Third, the action of selling, 
without price ceilings or in excess of the stipulated price 
differentials or profit rates, those commodities whose prices 
have been liberalized and raising prices in disguised forms such 
as giving short measure, adulterating, and using inferior goods 
in place of proper ones. Fourth, the action of violating state 
regulations regarding the system of putting on file and 
submitting reports on price adjustments and the procedures for 
controlling price differentials and setting temporary price 
limits and also the action of failing to clearly mark prices. 
Fifth, the action of arbitrarily raising the prices of 
agricultural capital goods, such as chemical fertilizer, plastic 
film for farming, farm chemicals, and diesel oil for farm use, 
as well as electricity prices in rural areas, in violation of 
the relevant state regulations. Sixth, the action of exceeding 
one's authority in introducing new fee collection items, 
enlarging the scope of fee collection, and raising the fee 
collection standards at random. 
  Chen Jinhua demanded that all units and individuals under 
inspection voluntarily accept inspection by providing actual 
data. Those who find pretexts to create difficulties and refuse 
inspection will be punished heavily. Inspectors and those who 
report and inform against misconduct should be protected and no 
retaliation against them will be tolerated. Those who shield, 
are partial to, or connive at price violations will be held 
accountable and seriously dealt with. Meanwhile, in light of 
the problems discovered during the inspection, we should 
strengthen management of those commodities whose prices have 
been liberalized. At the same time, we should also help 
enterprises to establish sound rules and regulations, promote 
their change of operational mechanism, and strengthen their 
ability for self-restraint. 
<H5>  Investigate and Punish Illegal Conduct According to Law and </H5>
Protect Consumer's Interests 
  Chen Jinhua said: The nationwide price inspection is based 
on the following laws, regulations, and policies: The "PRC 
Regulations on Price Management"; the State Council's "Circular 
on Launching Nationwide Price Inspection" and "Circular on 
Strengthening Supervision and Inspection Over the Prices of the 
Basic Necessities of Life and Service Fees"; the "Stipulations 
on Putting Goods on Sale and Offering Services With Prices 
Clearly Marked" promulgated by the State Planning Commission 
with State Council approval; the "Circular on Views on Verifying 
and Handling Items Involving Peasant Burdens" by the CPC Central 
Committee General Office and the State Council General Office; 
the Finance Ministry's "Regulations on Bringing Unauthorized Fee 
Collection Under Control" transmitted by the CPC Central 
Committee General office and the State Council General Office; 
the "Circular on Ensuring Price Stability After Tax System 
Reform" by the State Planning Commission and the State 
Administration of Taxation; the "Regulations on Punishing Cases 
of Price Violations" by the former State Price Bureau; and a 
series of other administrative rules and regulations and 
normative documents. 
  During the nationwide price inspection, we should continue 
to 
carry out the policy of "being lenient toward those who check 
themselves and severe toward those who are checked, seeking 
truth from facts, and treating with appropriate leniency and 
severity". The units and individuals who have violated relevant 
price regulations will be ordered to return their illegal gains 
to the purchasers or users. The illegal gains which cannot be 
returned will be confiscated by price inspection institutions. 
At the same time, the units and individuals concerned will be 
fined according to the seriousness of their cases. When 
necessary, the industrial and commercial administration will be 
requested to revoke their business licenses. If they refuse to 
return the illegal gains or pay the fines, the price inspection 
institutions can instruct the bank wherein they have their 
account to transfer the money in accordance with the relevant 
regulations. If they do not have any bank account, or there is 
no money in their bank account, the price inspection 
institutions have the right to sell their goods to cover the sum 
they should return or pay as a fine. The inspection 
institutions can impose fines on those who assume direct 
responsibility and those in charge of the enterprises and public 
institutions according to the seriousness of their cases. It 
can also suggest that the department concerned take disciplinary 
sanction against them. Those who violate the criminal law, thus 
committing a crime, will be investigated by the judicial 
department and their criminal responsibilities affixed. 
  In conclusion, Chen emphatically pointed out: In the general 
price inspection it is necessay to step up the study on drawing 
demarcation lines in applying a policy and strive to solve new 
problems, with new ways of thinking and new methods, in 
accordance with the goal of establishing a socialist system of 
market economy to ensure the implementation of the macroeconomic 
regulation and control measures and promote the sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy.

  [Text] Wuhan, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The annual steel output of 
the Chang Jiang river valley last year reached 35 million tons, 
accounting for 43 percent of China's total, according to 
authoritative statistics. 
  At present, six out of the country's 13 most profitable iron 
and steel enterprises are in the Chang Jiang valley. They 
include the Baoshan Steel Works Group in Shanghai at the mouth 
of the Yangtze, and Maanshan, Wuhan and Panzhihua iron and steel 
companies on the lower, middle and upper reaches of the river. 
  The Baoshan Steel Works Group is now the country's most 
advanced steel enterprise involving the biggest amount of 
foreign investment. Last year, the group gained four billion 
yuan (460 million U.S. dollars) of pre-tax profits, ranking 
first among all iron and steel enterprises in China. 
  The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's annual output of iron and 
of steel both surpassed five million tons for the first time 
last year, at 5.4 million tons and 5.224 million tons 
respectively. 
  Experts noted that the growth of the iron and steel industry 
in the Chang Jiang valley has helped promote economic 
development in the whole area, contribute greatly to the opening 
up and development of the Pudong new area in Shanghai and will 
supply needed rolled steel and other materials for the 
construction of the Three Gorges hydraulic projects on the 
Yangtze.

<F P=106> [By Gao Anming: "Farm Profits Outstripped by Rural </F>
Enterprises in '93"] 
  [Text] Agriculture made impressive gains in China last 
year thanks to fine weather and the government's moves to 
protect farmers' interests. 
  The achievements, however, failed to increase farmers' 
income 
correspondingly, nor did it boost their enthusiasm or investment 
in farming. Agriculture continued to roll out less profits than 
almost all other rural undertakings did, according to the 
economic Green Paper '94 published late last month. 
  The book was a joint project of the Institute of Rural 
Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the 
Division of Rural Social Development of the State Statistics 
Bureau (SSB). 
  One of the country's major agricultural accomplishments was 
that the output of cereals and oil-bearing crops struck an 
all-time high, according to the report. 
  Localities reported 456.4 million tons of cereal output in 
1993, 3.1 per cent more than 1992, despite a decline of 480,000 
hectares in sowed acreage. The country reaped 17.6 million tons 
of oil crops, up 7.3 per cent, the book says. 
  However, studies of the Ministry of Agriculture and SSB 
estimate the actual cereal output last year to be 2.1 percent 
lower than the report. Even so, the yield would still be the 
highest in history. 
  Grain production in 15 provinces in northern China increased 
by a large margin whereas that in the South fell. Guangdong, 
Fujian and Zhejiang provinces continued to show red ink on 
reports of grain output. The drop is a major factor behind the 
hefty food price hikes that spread from south to north late last 
year. 
<H5>  Cotton </H5>
  The output of other major farm products also increased 
except 
for cotton and sugar crops, which fell 16.6 and 13.5 percent 
respectively. 
  The production of cotton had dipped 20.2 percent in 1992 
compared to the previous year. 
  The agricultural sector turned out 1,003 billion yuan ($115 
billion) in output value, up 5 percent allowing for inflation. 
Farming went up 4.1 percent, better than the 3.2 percent growth 
in the previous year. The increase of forestry, animal 
husbandry, sideline production and fisheries, however, was 
slower than the previous year. 
  The government spent 7 percent more, or 43 billion yuan 
($4.9 
billion) on agriculture last year. However, its direct 
investment in rural capital construction dropped, after 
deducting for inflation. 
  Less developed as it is compared with urban areas, the 
countryside still saw a net 81.5 billion yuan ($9.3 billion) 
flow to cities. 
  Farming was carried out on a super-small scale. There were 
350 million rural labourers in the countryside, each of whom was 
entitled to an average of a mere 0.34 hectares of land. 
Small-scale farming made it virtually impossible for farmers to 
earn the same as their urban workers, the book says. 
  The growth of rural non-agricultural businesses set a new 
record. They turned out 2,721 billion yuan ($313 billion) in 
products and services last year, an increase of 67 percent on 
1992. The amount made up 40 percent of the country's 
nonagricultural output, up by 32 percent over the previous year, 
and accounted for 73 percent of gross rural output. 
  Manufacturing generated the bulk of the output value, 
seizing 
77 percent of the total. The building industry constituted 10.2 
percent, transportation 5.4 percent and the catering business 
7.3 percent. 
  Although the share of rural industry was still overwhelming, 
it was 2 percentage points down from the previous year. On a 
brighter note, the building industry, transport and services 
gained 2 percentage points. 
  The book recognizes the change as a welcoming sign of an 
increasingly rationalized industrial structure. 
<H5>  Gap </H5>
  The gap between the coast and hinterland, which had been 
widening since the mid-1980s, has started to close, another 
welcome sign, the book says. 
  Rural non-agricultural businesses in Central and West China 
grew 70 per cent, faster than the national average. They turned 
out 33 per cent of the country's products and services, up 1 
percentage point on the previous year. Rural enterprises 
invested heavily in updating equipment. They boasted 593 
billion yuan ($68 billion) in fixed assets by year end, up 34 
percent on 1992, the highest in history. 
  "The increase is beneficial to sharpening rural businesses' 
competitive edge before China rejoins the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade and before State-owned enterprises accomplish 
their market-oriented restructuring," the book says. 
  State firms have also become a major investor in rural 
development. In 1993, they pumped 42 billion yuan ($4.8 
billion) into assisting agriculture and rural infrastructure 
construction, almost the same as the government did, and 30 
percent more than 1992. 
  Rural firms created 6.24 million new jobs. They employed 
109.5 million people, roughly the same as State-owned 
enterprises did, and 24.4 per cent of total rural labour. 
  Private businesses became a major absorber of surplus rural 
labour. They hired more than 50 million people last year, and 
provided 62 percent of new non-agricultural jobs. 
  Yet in proportion to their output increase, rural firms have 
been taking on fewer labourers. Instead, they have become more 
capital intensive. Last year, they recruited only half the 
people who would otherwise have been hired, considering the 
employment elasticity of the previous year. 
  The Green Paper blames the decrease on the country's 
sluggish 
urbanization, which hindered the development of the largely 
labour-intensive tertiary industry. 
  The increase in farmers' income significantly slowed last 
year. An average rural resident made 921 yuan ($106), an 
increase of 3.2 per cent allowing for inflation, down from 5.9 
per cent for the previous year. 
  Compared with their urban counterparts, rural folks, who 
made 
up 70 percent of the population, earned 60 percent less. The 
income ratio between the two stood at 1:2.5, even smaller than 
the level for 1978, when rural reforms were inaugurated. 
  Meanwhile, the prices of agricultural materials, such as 
fertilizer diesel oil and farm machinery, jumped from 10 to 70 
percent during the first three quarters. This led farmers to 
cut 10 percent of their investment in agriculture, and the sales 
volume of farm materials dropped 8 percent, allowing for 
inflation. 
  The sluggish income growth was also to blame for the drop of 
rural market share from 52 percent in 1992 to 48 percent last 
year. 
  The book estimates that 49.2 million farmers sought jobs 
outside their home villages, of whom 38.7 million people worked 
in cities or towns. 
  Transient farmers worked 205 days a year outside their homes 
on the average. They made 3,649 yuan ($419) from work, 
significantly higher than the 2,280 yuan ($262) they would earn 
if working in rural enterprises. They sent or brought an 
average of 2,009 yuan ($231) back to their families.

  [Text] While carrying out investigations and studies in 
Guangxi recently, Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau, state councillor, and director of 
the State Commission for Restructuring Economy, pointed out: 
There are inherent laws governing economic development. Areas 
inhabited by minority nationalities must make use of the 
favorable opportunity resulting from industrial transference 
from more advanced areas of the country to take the initiative 
to readjust their industrial setups in light of their own local 
conditions. This is of great significance to speeding up their 
economic development. 
  From 21 to 26 April, Li Tieying went deep into enterprises 
in 
Beihai, Nanning, Liuzhou, and Guilin to carry out on-the-spot 
inspections, and held discussions with responsible persons of 
relevant local units and entrepreneurs. 
  Since last year, cadres and masses of various nationalities 
in Guangxi have implemented the spirit of the remarks of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping made during his southern tour and of the 14th CPC 
National Congress to further emancipate their minds and speed up 
the pace of reform and opening up. Guangxi has entered a period 
of rapid development. Last year the region's GNP was 19.6 
percent higher than in 1992. This was the best year in its 
history. Total incomes of township and town enterprises 
increased by 140 percent, and the margin of increase had ranked 
first in the whole country for three years running. The amount 
of foreign capital actually used increased by 300 percent, and 
the margin of increase also led in the coastal areas. People's 
livelihood had been markedly improved, and per capita income of 
residents in cities and towns grew by 38.5 percent. Per capita 
net income of peasants rose by 20.9 percent. 
  Li Tieying held: As long as we promote reform through 
expanding opening up, promote opening up through deepening 
reform, seize on the fine opportunity of industrial 
transference, and exploit Guangxi's regional strong points, we 
can follow a suitable path for our efforts to speed up economic 
development. He pointed out: When economic development is 
speeded up, industrial transference can definitely be quickened. 
At present, more advanced areas are speeding up their 
industrial transference to less advanced areas. For the latter, 
this is their fine opportunity. The fact that sugar production 
is being shifted from the east to the west is a good example. 
Guangdong was a big sugar-producing province. In recent years, 
it is making efforts to develop other undertakings with higher 
additional value. Guangxi is now making great efforts to 
vigorously develop its sugarcane planting undertaking, and cane 
sugar processing industry as well. Its sugar production output 
now rank first in the whole country. Taking the initiative to 
seize the fine opportunity of the more advanced areas' 
industrial transference is a good idea for promoting economic 
development. Promoting industrial transference in a region 
itself is also a good idea. Readjusting product mix in 
accordance with international market demand aimed at increasing 
its market share is a good idea too. For instance, Guangxi 
produces more than 800 kinds of tropical fruit. The 
fruit-processing industry can be spread from key cities like 
Nanning and others to other prefectures, counties and cities. 
Guilin's watermelon frost [a kind of Chinese medicine] is warmly 
welcomed by consumers. If a city noted for tourism can develop 
its main production of souvenirs to meet the demand of both 
Chinese and foreign tourists, it can have more opportunities to 
occupy the market. Organization and development work in a 
planned way can form unique industrial strong points of areas 
inhabited by minority nationalities. 
  Li Tieying said: It is necessary to carry out various kinds 
of reforms on an experimental basis in a number of selected 
enterprises in townships and cities, do a solid job, and score 
achievements. He added: Under the new situation of reform, 
cadres must participate in transformation and carry out profound 
investigations and studies. It is unnecessary for them to devise 
a certain kind of pattern. They must conscientiously sum up 
experiences. Factory directors and managers must study hot and 
difficult points in reform, and become all-round entrepreneurs 
noted for their effective operations. Areas inhabited by 
minority nationalities must proceed from reality to actively and 
steadily carry out reform in systems regarding enterprises' 
property rights and the establishment of modern enterprises. 
  Li Tieying stressed: Guangdong has fully exploited its 
strong points of being adjacent to Hong Kong and Macao, 
adjoining international markets, and having quick access to 
information to promote its economic development. Guangxi also 
has the strong point of adjoining the Southeast Asian market. 
It must grasp well infrastructure projects to fully make use of 
its strong point as a sea passageway of the vast southwestern 
region to invigorate its economy and cause it to serve the vast 
southwestern region. It must firmly seize the fine opportunity 
of the flow of commerce, commodities, qualified personnel, and 
information brought about by its position as a sea passageway to 
make itself prosperous and flourishing through reform and 
opening up. 
  When Comrade Li Tieying was carrying out his inspection in 
Guangxi, regional CPC Secretary Zhao Fuli, who was conducting 
investigations and studies in prefectures and counties, reported 
to and briefed him on our region's reform and opening up, and 
economic development in recent years. Liu Mingzu, regional 
party deputy secretary and chairman of the regional people's 
congress standing committee, accompanied Comrade Li Tieying 
during the entire inspection tour.

  [Text] While conducting investigations and research in 
Shanghai recently, Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau, secretary of the CPC Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission, and president of the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions, indicated: As the Shanghai 
Municipal Party Committee and government have been upholding the 
principle "that while enhancing economic construction, we should 
also simultaneously and strictly crack down on crimes," 
Shanghai's anticorruption work has a relatively firm foundation. 
He expressed his hope: Proceeding from Shanghai's current 
actual conditions, the municipal party committee and government 
will continually explore new experiences in improving the 
party's workstyle and enhancing honest government under the new 
circumstances, and will play greater roles in boosting 
Shanghai's reform, development, and stability. 
  While conducting investigations and research in Shanghai 
during 16-25 April, Comrade Wei Jianxing held conversations with 
Wu Bangguo, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, 
and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju. He successively heard work reports 
given by Zhang Huixin, secretary of the municipal discipline 
inspection commission, and Bao Xinbao, chairman of the Shanghai 
Municipal Trade Union Council. He also separately held 
discussion meetings with leaders of some district and county 
party committees and governments, secretaries of some discipline 
inspection commissions, and cadres of enterprise trade unions. 
Additionally, he personally visited the Pudong New District and 
the Caohejing Development Zone. 
  Comrade Wei Jianxing pointed out: When carrying out 
anticorruption drive, we should pay attention to handling it 
from a macroeconomical viewpoint, stress education programs, aim 
at prevention, be concerned to resolve deep-seated issues, and 
properly conduct comprehensive rectification. The Shanghai 
Municipal Party Committee and government have been resolutely 
carrying out the anticorruption drive formulated by the party 
Central Committee and the State Council, and have been improving 
the party's workstyle and enhancing honest government by 
upgrading relevant mechanisms and legal and organizational 
systems. It is a good experience. He expressed his hope: 
Persistently proceeding from its current actual conditions, 
Shanghai will continually explore new ways and methods in 
improving the party's workstyle and enhancing honest government 
under the new circumstances, and will creatively carry out the 
anticorruption drive. 
  Comrade Wei Jianxing pointed out: At present, trade unions 
at various levels should correctly regard and properly handle 
the relations among reform, development, and stability. They 
should pay special attention to and be concerned for, reveal, 
and help resolve the hardships of some staff members and 
workers. Trade unions should adapt to new circumstances; should 
widen their field of vision; should expand their tasks; and 
should actively explore new methods and new experiences that 
more effectively express and safeguard the specific interests of 
staff members and workers, while safeguarding the overall 
interests of all the Chinese people. They should support and 
participate in various reforms; should respect actual practice; 
should assess all tasks through experiments; should uphold and 
promote the party's fine traditions and trade union work 
experiences that have been accumulated in the past and that have 
been effective; and should realistically implement the party's 
policy of wholeheartedly relying on the working class.

<F P=106> [By A.R. Wilkie] </F>
  [Text] You could be forgiven for thinking that China's 
leftist ideologues had finally withered away in the white heat 
of capitalism which has swept the country in the past two years. 
Economic theory and practice seem to have far more to do with 
market forces than with Marx, particularly since the senior 
leader, Deng Xiaoping, called in early 1992 for accelerated 
reform. But some analysts believe that the leftists -- as China 
dubs orthodox Maoists -- are just biding their time. 
  "The leftists will launch a comeback soon," says one Chinese 
analyst, formerly a senior party official. He predicts leftists 
will take advantage of public dissatisfaction about lay-offs, 
corruption and inflation to criticise Deng Xiaoping's 
capitalist-style reforms. 
  China's post-1949 history has been a series of radical 
swings 
between left and right. Rarely has the leadership managed to 
steer a genuinely middle-of-the-road path for long. 
  If the leftists were able to successfully exploit popular 
dissatisfaction to stage a comeback, people like the Prime 
Minister, Li Peng, and Party General Secretary, Jiang Zemin -- 
who have sat firmly on the ideological fence -- could well sway 
back towards leftism. 
  In a commentary last month, the pro-leftist journal Zhenli 
de 
Zhuiqiu (The Pursuit of Truth) criticised the mainline 
party-controlled media for its failure to examine critically the 
growing gap between rich and poor: "By mainly reporting on 
successes and rarely reporting on problems, it will be 
impossible for the cadres and the people and the party and the 
government to stand together and exert themselves to solve the 
problems." In contemporary leftist-speak, "solving the 
problems" is a code for slowing down or -- better still -- 
halting market reforms. 
  In what appears to be an effort to protect Deng Xiaoping's 
legacy, some journalists say they have been ordered to report 
even less on economic and social problems in the run-up to the 
anniversary of June 4th. 
  Laying bare the continuing battle between leftists and 
rightists, the Zhenli de Zhuiqiu commentary also revived the 
phrase "bourgeois liberalisation". This term was extensively 
used in media attacks on student activists in 1987 and 1989, 
though it has since been largely dropped from the mainstream 
official press in an effort to present to the world an image of 
a government less obsessed by ideological feuds. 
  Within the party, however, its currency as the 
characterisation of the ideological enemy has never ebbed. 
"Bourgeois liberalisation is still the biggest threat on the 
ideological battlefront," said Zhenli de Zhuiqiu, in a direct 
challenge to Deng's 1992 statement that it is leftism that posed 
the biggest threat. It said the media must be mobilised to 
criticise bourgeois liberalisation, as it did effectively in the 
aftermath of June 4 1989 (the Tiananmen massacre), otherwise 
there would be "inestimable suffering". 
  In the long-term, as the former senior party official 
explains, leftists are far less of a threat to the Communist 
Party than are rightists. "No matter how leftist people are, 
they would never oppose the Communist Party," he says. 
  For some years, the figurehead of the leftists has been the 
79-year-old former central committee propaganda chief, Deng 
Liqun. Other easily identifiable members of this faction are 
also mainly active in the field of propaganda and culture, 
people like a former acting minister of culture, He Jingzhi, and 
writer-critics like Lin Mohan, Zang Kejia and Yao Xueyin. But 
this group also has powerful backers at every level of the 
party, including a senior leader, Chen Yun, and a former party 
organisation chief, Song Ping. 
  "Not only can the leftists get their views in print, in fact 
they control 80 per cent of the Beijing media," says the former 
senior party official. 
  The most important leftist journals include Dangdai Sichao 
(Contemporary Trends), Zhongliu, or Mainstream, which is 
published by the Guangming Daily newspaper and Zhandi 
(Warfront), published by the left-leaning Beijing municipal 
Communist Party committee. These publications have a small but 
influential readership. Reformers may roll their eyes at the 
extremism of the rhetoric, but they recognise that the journals 
must have powerful backers. 
  Superficially at least, these journals support Deng's 
reforms, quoting the ageing Chinese patriarch almost as 
frequently as Marx and Engels. But a closer look reveals some 
pointed criticisms. Certainly leftist writers have ignored 
Deng's instructions not to worry about whether something is 
"capitalist" or "socialist". This, in fact, is the focus of 
much of their debate. 
  One subject which has drawn particular attention in the 
leftist journals is privatisation of state industries and 
whether this can be compatible with socialism. These articles 
belie the claims that ideological factions no longer exist, or 
else that leftists and rightists have reached a consensus on the 
way ahead for the economy. 
  "The private economy in its essence is not surnamed 
`socialist', but in the present stage of socialism developing 
the private economy in a suitable manner is beneficial to the 
development of socialism," says the April 20 edition of Dangdai 
Sichao. 
  So far, so good -- Deng Xiaoping could not have put it 
better. But then the article goes on to argue that socialism 
cannot treat ownership as sacred. 
  "Once you have recognised that private ownership is sacred, 
then you would have to recognise that exploitation... is sacred 
in a socialist society... once you have recognised that private 
ownership is sacred, then you have to recognise that the private 
economy is sacred no matter what... and that all efforts by 
socialist countries in the past or the future to try to wipe out 
or reform the private economy are sacriligious. If this 
happens, then socialist theory would be completely overthrown." 
The logic here may be shaky, but to leftists like Deng Iiqun, 
the threat is real. 
  In early 1992, just as Deng Xiaoping was touring the south 
preaching neo-capitalist revival, Deng Liqun wrote in the 
Guangming Ribao: "We are stressing the long-term struggle 
against peaceful evolution, infiltration and subversion ... we 
must persist to the end, even if we have only one person left." 
  The leftists may appear to be down at the moment, an 
embattled minority railing in vain against the capitalist 
heresies that have transformed post-Mao China. But it would be 
a mistake to count them out.

  [Text] Beijing, May 4 (AFP)--Dissidents in China's biggest 
city, Shanghai, Wednesday denounced police for harassing them 
for the past week and said the situation is increasingly tense. 
Telephone service to his home and the homes of four other 
dissidents was cut April 27, said Bao Ge, adding that he was 
"constantly followed by policemen." 
  Also losing the use of their telephones were Yang Zhou, 
spokesman of the Chinese Human Rights Association, its secretary 
general, Wang Fucheng, as well as Fu Shenqi and Zhang Xianliang, 
two activists sentenced last summer to three years in a 
reform-through-labour camp. 
  As for Wang, he "disappeared three weeks ago and nothing has 
been heard from him since," Bao said. "The situation in Shanghai 
is more and more tense." 
  Chinese officials, fearing renewed antigovernment activities 
this May, have stepped up their repression of dissidents over 
the past few weeks, arresting dozens of them. 
  China's best-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng, remains under 
police surveillance in a hotel in suburban Beijing because, 
officials said, he is suspected of "new crimes." 
  Bao also said a meeting between lawyers and the general 
public in Shanghai's Xiangyang Park on April 24, with the theme 
"Legal Advice," had been cut short by police because of the 
large number of complaints and insults directed against the 
police and the government. "This public meeting almost 
degenerated into a demonstration against corruption and human 
rights violations," Bao added. 
  Asked about the incident by telephone, police declined to 
comment.

  [Text] Beijing, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, is 
expected to formulate a decision on punishing criminals who 
violate copyrights at the committee's seventh session which 
opens May 5. 
  Spokesman of the General Office of the NPC Standing 
Committee 
Shen Zhangrong said this morning that China's Copyright Law has 
played a "significant role" in protecting copyrights and 
promoting the development of China's cultural and scientific 
causes since it was put into effect on June 1, 1991. 
  "However, piracy of books, audio and video tapes, and 
computer software has become quite rampant in recent years, in 
illegal attempts to reap huge profits," Shen said. 
  This has infringed upon the rights of the authors and 
destroyed the normal order of the socialist cultural market and 
economic activities. "It has also affected foreign trade of the 
country and its cultural and scientific exchanges and 
cooperation with foreign countries," said the spokesman, adding 
that perpetrators of this kind of activity should be severely 
punished. 
  During the eight-day session, the legislators will also 
deliberate over nine other draft laws and regulations. They are 
the draft law on management of urban real estate, draft 
supplementary provisions to regulations governing offenses 
against public order, draft amendments to the regulations on 
active service and ranks of military officers of the People's 
Liberation Army, the draft law on judges and the draft law on 
prosecutors. 
  The legislators will also hear a report on the construction 
of the Three-Gorges Dam project.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Shouldering the Historical Mission Straddling </F>
This Century and the Next -- In Commemoration of the 75th 
Anniversary of the May 4th Movement"] 
  [Text] Today is the "4 May" Youth Day. We extend our 
cordial festival greetings to the young people of various 
circles throughout the country! 
  Young friends, in another six years we will step into the 
21st century. At this historical moment, straddling two 
centuries, all people who are concerned with the destiny of the 
motherland -- and particularly this generation of young people, 
who represent the future and hope of the country and nation -- 
are faced with a question: What kind of attitude should they 
adopt in marching toward the new century? In a sense, the 
spiritual outlook of this generation of young people will 
determine, to a great extent, the future of the Chinese nation 
in the coming century. We are faced with tremendous 
opportunities for development, as well as stern challenges. The 
party and the people ardently hope that the young people of this 
generation will inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition 
of 4 May, have a sense of straddling the centuries, understand 
their responsibilities, shoulder the mission, and become a new 
generation that has lofty ideals and moral values, that studies 
hard, and that builds the country through arduous efforts. In 
the years running up to the 21st century, they should let their 
youthfulness radiate in the great cause of revitalizing the 
Chinese nation. 
  To shoulder the historical mission of straddling the 
centuries, the fundamental thing is to arm the young people with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and to uphold the party's basic line 
firmly for 100 years. People can see clearly that the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics is Marxism for 
contemporary China and is the only correct guide for the work of 
leading our country toward prosperity. We should stress this 
truth frequently and repeatedly, and in connection with vivid 
reality, and should tell it to this generation, as well as the 
next. From the high plane of the country's future and the 
nation's destiny, we should understand the far-reaching 
historical significance of applying the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics to educating the 
generation of young people. 
  Both comprehensively improving the qualities of this 
generation of young people and training large numbers of 
outstanding people constitute important tasks for shouldering 
the historical mission straddling the centuries. In the final 
analysis, competition in the world is one of economic strength 
and comprehensive national strength, which is focused on 
science, technology, and qualified personnel. To meet the 
challenge of the new century, we should vigorously create 
conditions to help young people acquire knowledge of science and 
technology, as well as of the socialist market economy, and 
should endeavor to gain professional proficiency, improve their 
labor techniques, and master skills for the modernization 
program. Practice is the best classroom for training young 
people, and integration with the masses is the only way to raise 
young people. We hope that this generation of young people will 
inherit the glorious tradition of their predecessors and will go 
to the grass-roots levels and hardship posts, the places where 
they are most needed for reform and construction. They should 
accumulate experience in practice, absorb nutrition, temper 
their will, enhance their talents, and make contributions. They 
should establish a career and become useful people in the 
struggle to revitalize the nation and make the country strong 
and powerful. 
  Molding people with a noble spirit and enhancing young 
people's level of socialist spiritual civilization is a major 
project that will continue beyond this century. It is necessary 
to highlight education in patriotism, collectivism, and 
socialism; help young people adopt a correct outlook on the 
world and life, as well as correct values; boost their national 
dignity and confidence, and the urge to make their country 
strong; and resist the corrosion of such decadent ideologies as 
money-worship, hedonism, and out-and-out individualism. 
Recently, a large number of advanced individuals have come to 
the fore among the young generation. Represented by Xu Honggang 
and others, they are exemplary in standing up for what is right 
and take pleasure in helping others. They have been playing a 
positive role in encouraging healthy trends and reversing 
unhealthy social trends. It is necessary to guide young people 
in learning from heroes and following the correct path; discover 
and bring up a larger number of advanced and exemplary 
individuals to attract, educate, and inspire the youth; and 
greatly upgrade the level of civilization and moral integrity of 
young people and of society as a whole. 
  The Communist Youth League [CYL] is a mass organization of 
the youth and it shoulders an important responsibility in 
leading young people on their journey into the next century. We 
appraise highly the "Youth Civilization Project Beyond This 
Century" and the "Young Talent Project Beyond This Century" 
being implemented by the CYL. These two projects are in line 
with the party's requirements for youth, and with the demands 
placed on young people by the reform and construction of the 
country. We ardently hope that CYL organizations at all levels 
will stand on solid ground, work in a down-to-earth manner, 
organize and carry out projects in a painstaking manner, and 
strive to gain significant results. Party committees and 
governments at all levels should take good care of, and give 
energetic support to the CYL in conducting a wide and colorful 
variety of activities suited to the characteristics of young 
people. Various circles and departments in society should 
create still better conditions and environment for the growth of 
young people. 
  Seizing opportunities, deepening reform, expanding opening 
up, promoting development, and maintaining stability are the 
most important aspects of the work of the whole party and 
country this year. The youth-related work should be aligned to 
and serve these overall interests. A thousand-mile journey is 
begun by taking the first step. From now on, our young friends 
should have a sense of urgency which propels them to race 
against time. They should have their feet planted in the 
present and their eyes on the future, should study and work 
diligently with full enthusiasm and a down-to-earth attitude, 
and should greet the bell heralding the coming of a new century 
by creating excellent achievements that will give them a clear 
conscience before the older generations.

<F P=106> ["Notes on a northern journey" by staff reporter Lo Ping </F>
(5012 0393): "Three Major Worries Disturb Deng Xiaoping"] 
  [Text] "The World Regards My Life and Death as a 
Critical Point" 
  There is a saying: When a man is dying, his words are nice; 
when a bird is dying, its voice is pitiful. Aware that his 
remaining years are few, Deng Xiaoping recently talked about 
what would happen after his death. Sometimes he referred to 
China's situation after his death, and sometimes he talked about 
arrangements after his death. Recently, he talked soberly about 
arrangements after his death and the current situation. He said: 
  I note that the world is still paying attention to me and 
regards my personal role, health, and life or death as a 
critical point. This is not normal. The day I meet the premier 
[Zhou Enlai] and my comrades in arms is approaching. This is 
the law of nature. But I am not going as fast as people 
overseas think. I have said time and again that neither I nor 
my remarks should be given too much publicity or lauded too 
much; instead propagation should be given to the party's line, 
principles, and policies, as well as the leadership of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council. I would like to say 
once again that after I am no longer around, do not hold 
large-scale ceremonies, do not praise me too highly, and do not 
give too much publicity to my remarks, writings, or work; still 
less should a memorial hall or statue be built for me. People 
in various circles should be discouraged from doing this. 
<H5>  Document No. 94019 Quotes Deng Xiaoping's Recent Remarks </H5>
  Deng Xiaoping's remarks were relayed to the Political Bureau 
by Jiang Zemin recently. On 11 April the CPC Central Committee 
Secretariat issued "classified" document No. 94019, entitled 
"General Secretary Jiang Zemin Relays Deng Xiaoping's Important 
Remarks to the Political Bureau." This document summed up the 
main points of Deng Xiaoping's remarks at the National People's 
Congress in March and during a meeting of the Political Bureau 
Standing Committee members in early April. Apart from talking 
about arrangements after his death, Deng Xiaoping also appraised 
the Central Committee's work and current problems. 
<H5>  Deng Xiaoping Confirms the Central Leadership </H5>
  Deng Xiaoping delivered a high appraisal of the central 
leadership. Jiang Zemin relayed this by saying: 
  In the four years since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 
13th CPC Central Committee to the new leadership elected at the 
14th CPC Central Committee, practice has proven that this is a 
staunch, competent, united, and farsighted leadership, which 
enjoys the people's trust and support, as well as international 
support. The Political Bureau and its Standing Committee have 
withstood the stiffest tests; this is very important. Comrades 
of the Central Military Commission have a clear-cut stand and 
closely follow the party Central Committee. Now, our situation 
is stable, well-founded, and ensured. There is a stable 
political situation of unity between the party, the government, 
and the military. This suggests that the party's line, 
principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee have been correct and should be 
further implemented and developed. Chen Yun, Wan Li, Shangkun, 
Yibo, Desheng, and I are of the opinion that leaders of your 
generation are more competent than we are, more farsighted, less 
bookish, less dogmatic, less affected by old conventions, and 
are quick in changing your brains. 
<H5>  When Talking About the Current Situation, Deng Xiaoping </H5>
Revealed His Uneasiness 
  Despite his satisfaction with the Central Committee 
leadership group, Deng Xiaoping revealed his uneasiness when 
talking about the party's main tasks. He pointed out that 
localism, intra-party corruption, and "leftist" interference are 
three major problems. The chief architect does not seem to have 
a method to resolve these problems. 
<H5>  Localism Is Ruining the Party's Cause </H5>
  Deng Xiaoping expressed his indignation over intra-party 
factionalism, sectarianism, and localism. He said: 
  We must frequently and repeatedly say in the party that it 
is 
impermissible to engage in factionalism or sectarianism, or to 
put oneself above the party committee; we must guard against 
this. Intra-party factionalism is not allowed because it will 
ruin the party's cause and the country's future. At present, it 
is necessary to rectify and overcome sectarianism and localism. 
We must admit and acknowledge that localism, sectarianism, and 
intra-party anarchy have played a destructive role in the 
implementation of the party's policies and principles and to our 
cause. Leaders who cannot consciously correct or do not 
acknowledge their mistakes in work must be replaced, 
transferred, rectified, and reorganized. We must be resolute. 
  Corruption Has Caused Party To Lose Its Leadership 
Initiative 
  Deng Xiaoping pointed out that intra-party corruption at 
present has gone beyond what people imagine and that the 
consequences are very serious. He said: 
  I have noted that anticorruption work needs more courage and 
effort. Anticorruption work has yielded results in previous 
periods. Corruption is more serious and complicated than we 
imagine. In localities and departments where corruption is 
serious, they cannot be politically clean and their leadership 
groups are weak and lax. I have told some veteran comrades that 
in combating corruption, we should proceed from ourselves and 
our families and relatives; veteran and middle-aged cadres 
should not commit mistakes in this respect. Recently, some 
people have said that there is also corruption in Europe, Japan, 
Asia, and Taiwan and that their corruption is very serious. 
This comparison is very dangerous. If corruption cannot be 
resolved, our party and government will lose their leadership 
initiative and it will be hard for us to have a reputation for 
giving instructions and guidance. In this scenario, our cause 
will fail. 
<H5>  "Interference From Many Aspects" Must Be Removed </H5>
  This chief architect admitted that reform is meeting 
interference from many aspects, particularly from the "left" 
aspect (he first mentioned such interference). He stressed the 
problem of "interference from within the contingent itself" and 
that the problem of not complying with the Central Committee 
ideologically or in actions should be resolved. This was 
targeted at conservatives. In relaying Deng Xiaoping's remarks, 
Jiang Zemin said: 
  In carrying out socialist construction and reform, including 
political reform, we should be sober-minded instead of being 
intoxicated with self-satisfaction or complacency. There is 
interference from many aspects, and this interference has 
basically never stopped for the past 10-odd years. There is 
"left" and right interference. Of course, there is also 
interference from U.S. hegemonism and power politics; this has 
never stopped. But we must resolve interference and 
disturbances from within our own contingent. Namely, we must 
comply with the Central Committee ideologically and in actions. 
In this way, we will be able to overcome "left" and right 
interference in a timely manner, instead of becoming passive. 
  Deng Xiaoping's "latest instructions" in classified document 
No. 94019, apart from the arrangements for after his death, 
soberly talked about information which is hard to obtain, and 
the rest was on "major principles" and does not contain anything 
new. But Jiang Zemin regards Deng Xiaoping's remarks as 
imperial edicts. In fact, Jiang Zemin understands very well 
that the CPC's corruption, sectarianism, and localism are 
deep-rooted habits which are difficult to remove. The chief 
architect's empty talk cannot help resolve practical problems. 
Deng Xiaoping said that "in political reform... one should not 
remain complacent." He does not mean what he says. Everyone 
knows that there is no political reform in the chief architect's 
blueprint. The problem is not one of marking time in political 
reform; there have been no first steps at all.

Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "During His Southern Tour, Yang 
Shangkun Witnesses Signs of Crisis"] 
  [Text] Is the vast land of China full of vigor? 
  In CPC organs, the answer is "yes." It is hard to find such 
an opinion: A crisis is hidden behind the vitality. It is even 
difficult to hear the authorities admit that vitality with 
hidden crises is not healthy vigor. 
  Recently, a CPC document sounded the alarm bells and 
analyzed 
in detail the crisis the CPC is facing. Not just one, but three 
crises exist. 
  It was an investigation report, and the report was written 
by 
former PRC president Yang Shangkun. The 23,000-character report 
was submitted personally by Yang Shangkun to the Political 
Bureau. 
  Between mid-January and mid-February of this year, Yang 
Shangkun inspected six cities in Guangdong, namely, Guangzhou, 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Zhongshan, and Shunde. In mid-March, 
he further inspected six cities in Guangdong, Hainan, and 
Fujian, namely, Zhanjian, Maoming, Haikou, Sanya, Xiamen, and 
Quanzhou. The General Office of the CPC Central Committee 
issued a notice to the party committees in the three provinces, 
stating that Comrade Yang Shangkun was going to make inspections 
and investigations in a number of cities at the request of the 
CPC Central Political Bureau. In early April, Yang Shangkun 
submitted an investigation report in his own name to the 
Political Bureau. The CPC Central Secretariat added a note to 
the report, which said: "After more than one month of 
inspections and investigations, Comrade Yang Shangkun has summed 
up a report which points to the existence of major problems in 
our work. Leading cadres at all levels should give deep thought 
to the seriousness and harmfulness of the problems." The 
report, entitled "Party Building, Political and Ideological 
Education, and Social Morals Are All Facing Crisis," was issued 
to party and government leading bodies at the provincial and 
ministry level on 11 April. 
  The investigation report was divided into three main parts. 
  The first part was about party building and the quality of 
party membership. 
  The report pointed out: In the last seven to eight years, 
party building has always been the weak link. Party 
rectification is often superficial and ineffective, and at most 
just solves or temporarily solves some partial problems. The 
fundamental problem in party building has been obscured. Party 
building directly concerns the party's destiny, the relationship 
between the party and the people, and the party's mobilizing 
force and leading authority. At present, party cadres, including 
the party's senior leading cadres, have no interest or courage 
to handle party building, saying that it is not easy to achieve 
marked results in party building and that they do not know what 
to do in this regard for fear that this may be regarded as 
backtracking toward old practices. The hesitancy of leading 
cadres and their perplexity about such a matter of primary 
importance has become an urgent problem we are facing right now. 
The situation of party building will directly affect the 
healthy development of economic construction, reform, and 
opening. The success or failure of the ruling party in its own 
party building will eventually determine the future of the 
country. 
  Yang Shangkun told the truth on this matter. At present, the 
Communist Party is corrupt and is rotten from top to bottom and 
inside out. To exaggerate slightly, the CPC has become a sheet 
of loose sand. In such circumstances, how can it effectively 
conduct party building? Party rectification has not achieved 
any major results, neither will the anticorruption campaign. 
Yang Shangkun's report did not mention or dared not mention 
this, but it is thought that he is also aware of this. 
  The second part was about political-ideological education 
and 
propaganda work. 
  The report pointed out: The Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee correctly summed up and negated 
previous "leftist" practice in political-ideological education 
and in propaganda and pointed out that this was unsuited to 
national conditions and the development of the times. However, 
after that, a set of integrated guidelines for 
political-ideological education and propaganda suited to 
national conditions and the socialist system was lacking. This 
led to serious mistakes in work. Undoubtedly, in this regard, 
as Comrade Xiaoping pointed out several years ago, both of our 
hands should be tough, and we cannot only keep one hand tough 
and leave the other hand soft and weak. However, we did not 
handle this issue personally, and it has become a major 
difficulty. In recent years, leading bodies have been 
encouraged to pay attention to this issue, and the central 
leading body took the lead in doing so. However, due to 
obstructions in the people's minds and the influence of new 
social conditions on people's thinking, party workers have 
failed to conduct effective political-ideological education and 
have not given vigorous publicity to socialist ideology and 
communist ideals. It seems that socialist ideology, communist 
ideals, and the party's objectives have all become outdated and 
are no longer suited to the present days of reform and opening, 
and the people will no longer accept and maintain their belief 
in socialism and communism. This is an extremely dangerous 
tendency and signal at the moment. 
  In this part of the report, Yang Shangkun also reflected 
the true situation. The CPC's so-called political-ideological 
education and propaganda work are dying away indeed and "lack 
vitality." Who should be blamed for this? Mao Zedong once 
said: "The theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism- 
Leninism." Now, history and reality both show that 
Marxism-Leninism, especially Leninism, is seriously 
antiscientific, and the theoretical basis of the Communist Party 
has collapsed. The ideology and beliefs of Communist Party 
members have collapsed. What can be used to conduct 
political-ideological education? Who is still willing to listen 
to sermons about Marxism-Leninism or to chant the scriptures of 
socialism and communism? An informed theorist said: "Yang 
Shangkun told the truth. Political-ideological education and 
propaganda work is indeed completely lifeless. He was right in 
saying that `it seems that socialist ideology, communist ideals, 
and the party's objectives have all become outdated and are no 
longer suited to the present days of reform and opening, and 
that the people will no longer accept and maintain their belief 
in socialism and communism,' but the words `it seems that' are 
not used properly and should be replaced with `it is because.'" 
  The third part concerns social morals and public conduct. 
  The report said: Social morals are becoming rapidly 
corrupted, and this has aroused serious attention and concern 
among people in all social strata. Upright people in society 
are calling for civilization and morality in view of the 
increasing degeneration of public conduct, but this is not 
forming a strong force of opinion. Problems are obviously 
occurring inside the party and the government, and are reflected 
in the behavior of party cadres and party members. The party's 
revelation of and struggle against lawbreaking and disciplinary 
violations, and criticism and condemnation of corrupt and 
decadent conduct in society has not been noticed or supported by 
public opinion and propaganda organs. This cannot but be 
regarded as unusual and abnormal in people's China under the 
leadership of the 53-million-member Communist Party. Along with 
the development of human society and civilization, social morals 
and public conduct should make corresponding progress and should 
be enhanced. Violence, corruption, decadence, and amoral 
cultural tendencies that have engendered and developed in 
Western capitalist societies have aroused the serious attention 
of their governments. The present worsening public conduct and 
public order should arouse our party and government's serious 
attention and consideration. However, up to now, problems which 
could ruin human civilization, social construction, and Chinese 
culture and morality, and which could affect the growth of 
future generations, have not yet aroused sufficient vigilance 
among the people. 
  This part of the report also told the truth. Social morals 
and public conduct in mainland China are indeed becoming worse 
now to a much more serious degree compared with Western 
capitalist societies. The informed scholar said: "Yang Shangkun 
was not wrong to complain that the party and the government are 
not paying sufficient attention to social and moral crises. 
However, if the current system and structure is not changed, 
the CPC will not be able to head off these crises. Yang 
Shangkun called for `vigilance' against the crises, but what 
should be done after `vigilance' has been aroused?" 
  In facing these crises, the former state president did not 
know what to do, and the current CPC leadership are also at a 
loss about what to do. Even the chief architect does not know 
what to do. 
  The appearance of these crises has profound causes. A 
student of CPC history pointed out that, at present, the general 
public, as well as the CPC rank and file, have strong doubts 
about socialism and even hold a negative attitude. People 
generally hold that the experiments with socialism has failed, 
and the CPC and China should find another course, move out of 
the utopian realm, and comply with the trend of the times by 
thoroughly changing the system and structure. However, the big 
shots in Zhongnanhai, especially the hardheaded old guard, are 
still grasping power tightly and are unwilling to make even one 
little move ahead in political reform. Thus, it is no wonder 
that the CPC is deeply mired in a crisis-laden predicament.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China appears to have quietly shelved its 
controversial law on eugenics after encountering criticism from 
both within its own government and abroad. 
  The draft legislation, first submitted to the National 
People's Congress (NPC) last December, will not be on the agenda 
of this week's NPC Standing Committee meeting and is unlikely to 
be discussed at the following session, a spokesman said 
yesterday. 
  NPC spokesman Shen Zhangrong said the law could now only be 
discussed when a vacancy appeared in the NPC's busy schedule. 
He declined to say if a vacancy might appear this year or not. 
  The proposed law provoked outrage in many western countries 
because it appeared to advocate the forced sterilisation of 
mentally or physically handicapped women. The Ministry of 
Public Health denied any intention to force anyone to undergo 
sterilisation or have an abortion but the original draft was 
subsequently revised to make it appear less contentious. 
  The revised law, now entitled "the law on the protection of 
the health of mothers and infants", omits all mention of 
"inferior births" and "eugenics" and emphasises the positive 
rather than negative aspects of the programme. However, it is 
understood the revised draft is still not ready for submission 
to the NPC because of continued opposition from the State Family 
Planning Commission. 
  The commission has been critical of the proposed law in case 
it damages China's international reputation. The commission was 
also concerned the new law would create an additional workload 
without providing additional resources. 
  Despite the failure to enact the legislation, eugenics 
continues to be practised as a matter of course by local 
governments throughout China, particularly in the poorer 
provinces, such as Gansu, which do not have the resources to 
cope with the mentally and physically handicapped. Gansu 
introduced its eugenics law in 1989 and local family planning 
officials sterilised more than 1,000 "congenitally retarded" 
people with an IQ of less than 49 in the first year of the law's 
operation. 
  Analysts said the failure to pass the legislation might lead 
to greater problems for the mentally and physically handicapped 
in China. Leaving eugenics work up to ill-trained and 
unsympathetic local officials rather than codifying it in a 
national law would be of no benefit to those affected they said. 
"Its ironic that this legislation, which caused such a stink in 
the west, could have actually improved conditions for many 
mentally handicapped people in China," a Chinese population 
expert said.

  [Text] The son of a former state president is tipped to 
head the 100,000-man armed police in a forthcoming reshuffle of 
the anti-riot force in a bid to maintain stability in the 
post-Deng era. 
  The decision to promote Liu Yuan, son of the ousted Chinese 
president Liu Shaoqi, to political commissar of the paramilitary 
force was a compromise between conservative and reformist 
factions, Chinese sources said. 
  The younger Mr Liu, former vice-governor of central Henan 
Province, joined the armed police last year as political 
commissar of the paramilitary police's division responsible for 
safeguarding the nation's reservoir and power projects. 
  Sources said his transfer from the civilian to the security 
establishment last year was a move arranged by his patrons to 
pave the way for his promotion in the armed police force. 
  Mr Liu's new unit is considered a key element both in the 
internal power rivalries of Chinese leaders and in maintaining 
social stability in the post-Deng era. 
  Many of the influential incumbent party elders, known for 
their conservative views, were either supporters or proteges of 
Mr Liu's father. But Mr Liu himself is widely considered as a 
young educated reformist official Beijing sources said. 
  They added that Mr Liu's promotion was expected to be 
welcomed by many party elders and military officers. 
  China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping and state president 
Jiang 
  Zemin were the key persons behind the decision. 
  Mr Deng has been actively trying to promote Mr Jiang's 
status 
and hold over both the People's Liberation Army and the security 
apparatus, which includes the police, armed police and state 
security forces. 
  Mr Jiang, who is also party chief and chairman of the 
Central 
Military Commission, has been trying to strengthen his hold over 
the security apparatus, especially the armed police in the past 
year. 
  During his recent trips to the localities, he sought out and 
talked to senior officers of the regional army, paramilitary 
police and the police. 
  Last September, Mr Jiang called a meeting of top armed 
police 
officers in Beijing and urged them to be ready in the "struggle 
to safeguard state security and social stability" while 
observing "the absolute leadership of the party". 
  Aside from patrolling the borders, the armed police must 
also 
respond to internal challenges to the party and government, 
including those posed by dissidents and "class enemies".

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Qiao Linsheng (0829 2651 3932): "State </F>
Council and Central Military Commission Approve Dissemination of 
Proposal on Job Placements for Demobilized Military Cadres"] 
  [Text] Jinan, 4 Apr (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--Recently, the State 
Council and the Central Military Commission approved and issued 
the "Opinion on Job Placements for Demobilized Military Cadres 
in 1994." According to the document, 50,000 military cadres 
(including armed police officers) will be transferred to 
civilian posts this year. They will mainly be assigned to work 
in the forefront of economic construction, especially in the 
judicial and law-enforcement, industrial and commercial, 
administrative, taxation, and financial institutions. 
  In order to mitigate difficulties in arranging housing for 
demobilized military cadres and their families, the State 
Council's Work Group for Placement of Demobilized Army Officers 
[WGPDAO], the Ministry of Personnel, and the General Political 
Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] have worked out 
a set of rules for this year's work. The rules specify that 
with the exception of municipalities, provincial capitals, and 
some cities with independent budgetary status, demobilized 
military cadres who lived with their spouses during active 
service should, in principle, be assigned civilian jobs locally. 
If job placements need to be made in other provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities, a plan should be drafted 
by the local department for the placement of demobilized 
military cadres and delivered to the Work Group for Placement of 
Demobilized Army Officers for coordinated arrangements. 
Demobilized military cadres who are willing to work in remote 
and difficult areas specified by the state should be appointed 
to corresponding positions in addition to being given 
preferential treatment, and their housing should be guaranteed 
first. 
  The document on this year's placement of demobilized cadres 
also points out the need to adopt measures to attract 
demobilized cadres to work in tertiary industry and to encourage 
them to seek jobs on their own. Those who work with 
foreign-funded enterprises, township and town enterprises, joint 
ventures, private urban enterprises, and those going abroad to 
study may maintain their cadre status and their original wage 
levels in their personnel dossiers [dang an gong zi 2909 2714 
1562 6327]. Priority job placements should be given to cadres 
at the division and regiment level. Enterprises and other 
civilian institutions should give priority to placing cadres 
transferred from the military according to their own personnel 
systems, as well as the political and professional merits of the 
cadres, and should place them in posts which correspond to their 
posts in the Armed Forces. During their period of employment, 
demobilized cadres should not be laid off at will.

  [Text] China's military chiefs are likely to play a 
commanding role in determining who will govern the country when 
the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, dies. A reshuffle expected 
later this year in the top military decision-making body could 
offer clues as to the future political loyalties of the generals. 
  General Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman of the Communist Party's 
Central Military Commission (CMC) and the People's Liberation 
Army's second most senior serving military officer, is tipped to 
step down before the end of this year, sources in Beijing say. 
  Zhang, 79, was called upon by Deng at the 14th party 
congress 
in October 1992 to help oversee the purge of General Yang 
Baibing and his supporters. 
  Yang, formerly the PLA's chief political commissar and CMC 
secretary-general, was sacked by Deng for his aggressive 
political ambitions. Yang had hoped to use his control of the 
military establishment to secure a place at the top of the 
political leadership. 
  Zhang was given the task of retiring or transferring dozens 
of senior generals who had close connections to Yang and his 
elder half-brother, the former CMC first vice-chairman and state 
president, Yang Shangkun. 
  Observers say the Yangs' military power base has now been, 
in 
effect, crushed. Although some former associates of the Yangs 
still remain in office, they have little influence. 
  Zhang can now step down and make room for younger blood at 
the top of the military hierarchy. 
  The party general secretary and CMC chairman, Jiang Zemin, 
wants Zhang's replacement to be the Defence Minister, General 
Chi Haotian, one of his top military aides. Jiang and Chi have 
forged close ties since Jiang became CMC chairman in November 
1989, and Chi has worked hard to build up his 
commander-in-chief's profile within the ranks. 
  Chi, 65, has extensive command experience. He headed the 
General Staff Department (GSD), which manages the PLA's 
operational activities, from 1987 until 1992, when he was 
transferred to the Defence Ministry. That move was seen as a 
setback for Chi, as the Defence Ministry is considered a largely 
ceremonial portfolio. 
  Chi is regarded as a professional soldier with few obvious 
political ambitions, though his past military assignments 
included stints as a political commissar. There are suggestions 
that Chi could also be in line for the powerful post of CMC 
secretary-general, a position that has been left vacant since 
Yang Baibing's dismissal. This would see Chi running the 
day-to-day administration of the country's military affairs. 
  Although Chi is the front-runner to take over from Zhang, 
other names have also been mentioned. One is General Zhao 
Nanqi, president of the Academy of Military Sciences, a close 
supporter of Jiang. Another candidate is General Zhu Dunfa, 
commandant of the National Defence University. 
  Whoever replaces Zhang will have considerable influence in 
military policy making. Zhang's responsibilities as CMC 
vice-chairman include overseeing the appointment of senior 
commanders, reorganising the PLA's structure, and the 
formulation of the military's operational doctrines. 
  Zhang currently shares the running of the 3 million-strong 
PLA with General Liu Huaqing, executive CMC vice-chairman and 
the military's top-ranking officer. Liu, 78, is also the 
military's representative on the Politburo standing committee. 
He, too, is expected to make way for younger blood within the 
next few years. 
  The selection of Chi as CMC vice-chairman would 
substantially 
enhance Jiang's consolidation of a military power base. Since 
becoming CMC chairman, Jiang has worked hard in building his 
military connections, making particular efforts to build up his 
influence in the paramilitary People's Armed Police (PAP). 
  The PAP, which is responsible for internal security duties, 
has been substantially beefed up after its failure to contain 
public demonstrations in Beijing in the spring of 1989 led to 
the military's intervention. 
  But Jiang still has much to do before he can be confident 
the 
military is fully behind him. One handicap is his lack of 
military experience. Military commanders have in the past 
refused to give their support to leaders who they thought lacked 
military credentials. 
  How badly Jiang's lack of military experience will seriously 
hamper his power-building efforts remains to be seen as few 
other senior civilian leaders have any military background or 
even ties with the PLA. Lacking alternative candidates, the 
military chiefs may see Jiang as the best choice in pushing for 
their interests in the post-Deng leadership. 
  Jiang needs to win political control over the military if 
he is to have any chance to survive the power struggle that is 
likely to follow Deng's death. 
  As party secretary-general and state president, Jiang is 
formally China's top leader, but he is widely seen as a 
political lightweight and his involvement in substantive 
policy-making is said to be limited and uninspiring. But 
control of the military apparatus would guarantee Jiang an 
influential role in any post-Deng leadership. 
  As commander-in-chief, Jiang theoretically already has full 
control over the military, but he still needs Deng's approval 
before he can promote Chi and other supporters. 
  As the Yangs found to their cost, Deng guards his control 
over the military jealously. Jiang has to be careful that he is 
not seen as building a military power base that could threaten 
Deng. Deng strengthened his grip over the military leadership 
after the Yang purge by installing his chief personal secretary, 
General Wang Ruilin, as deputy director of the PLA's General 
Political Department (GPD). The GPD is responsible for watching 
over the political loyalties of the military rank and file. 
  Wang is not expected to remain in his GPD post for long 
after 
Deng's death as his general's rank was the reward for long 
service as Deng's military secretary. 
  The other important Deng loyalist in the military leadership 
is Liu Huaqing. As a Politburo standing committee member, Liu's 
role is to manage the military's relationship with the top party 
leadership, as well as to make sure the PLA's interests are 
taken into account in the making of national policies. Now 77, 
Liu's advancing years means that he is unlikely to maintain his 
position long after Deng's death. 
  The imminent passing of Liu and Zhang Zhen paves the way for 
Chi and other generals from the next generation to take over the 
military hierarchy. The political loyalties of this next 
generation of military leaders will not be known until they take 
over at the top. But as these officers are considered more 
professional than their predecessors, it is likely that their 
interests will be dictated more by institutional than personal 
considerations. 
  Although Jiang is working hard to build close political 
connections with the army's leadership, whether the generals 
will support him will depend on how hard they think he will 
fight in raising the military budget and whether they believe he 
will take their views into account in making foreign policy 
decisions. 
  But other civilian leaders, some with stronger support 
networks in the regular party hierarchy, could also offer 
similar assurances to the military's commanders in order to win 
their support. The military's voice is, therefore, likely to be 
more influential over these next few years.

  [Text] Fuzhou, May 3 (CNS) -- Torrential rain has struck 
Fujian Province in the past few days with Sanming, Nanping, 
Longyan, Putian, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou seriously hit. As of the 
release of this news, nearly 40 counties and cities have been 
affected by the rain which has claimed 16 lives. 
  Affected by a warm and wet current, most of the province has 
been generally hit by heavy rain since early this month. 
Sanming district was badly hit with its 11 counties and cities 
covering 130 towns and 1,450 villages facing emergency 
situations. Of them, Yongan city and the counties of Ninghua 
and Qingliu received over 300 millimetres of rain and Sanming 
city as well as the two counties of Youxi and Mingxi by over 200 
millimetres of rain. The rest of the province received rainfall 
of more than 100 millimetres. The flood peak level of the river 
at Ninghua was put at nearly 14 metres, the most dangerous flood 
peak level in recorded history. Affected areas within the county 
had their supply of water and electricity cut while roads 
leading from the county and telecommunication facilities were 
all damaged. The greatest flood peak in the past 40 years was 
seen in the Minjiang River valley at Youxi county because of the 
heavy rain and most parts of the land and villages situated on 
the plain were flooded. 
  Statistics show that damage in Sanming prefectures alone

Fujian and Fuzhou were also hit by tornadoes and hail with 
ensuing serious loss. Many houses, paddy fields and water as 
well as electricity facilities were destroyed while some 400 
households totalling 2,000 persons were made homeless. 
  The disaster has continued and leading cadres of various 
levels across the province have visited those places where 
disasters have taken place, trying their best to help settle 
victims of the rain and help them re-build their homes.

<F P=106> ["Chen Huanyou Makes an Important Speech at the Eighth </F>
Plenary Session of the Provincial Discipline Inspection 
Commission, Calling For Deepening the Anticorruption Struggle to 
Still Greater Results" -- XINHUA RIBAO headline] 
  [Excerpts] "Remain sober, resolutely act in accordance 
with the plans of the Central Committee and the provincial party 
committee, deepen the anticorruption struggle in a sustained and 
effective way, and strive to achieve new results stage by 
stage." Jiangsu CPC Committee Secretary Chen Huanyou made this 
remark at the eighth plenary session of the provincial 
discipline inspection commission yesterday when he set some 
requirements for Jiangsu's anticorruption work. [passage 
omitted] 
  Comrade Chen Huanyou's speech was divided into three parts: 
1. Conscientiously study and implement the guidelines of the 
Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission and have a better understanding of anticorruption 
work. 2. Deepen the anticorruption struggle in a sustained and 
more effective way and continue to score new results stage by 
stage. And, 3. Correctly handle the relationship among reform, 
development, and stability and do a good job in safeguarding 
social and political stability. 
  Chen Huanyou pointed out: Generally speaking, we have scored 
marked achievements in the fight against corruption. Since late 
August last year, party committees and governments throughout 
the province have conscientiously implemented the party Central 
Committee and State Council "Decision on Some Tasks That Need To 
Be Done in Fighting Corruption in the Near Future." [passage 
omitted] The spread of corruption has been brought under 
control. It should be noted that as a whole, Jiangsu's 
anticorruption work has progressed healthily. Basically, we 
have met the requirements expected by the party Central 
Committee and the provincial party committee. The general 
reaction from the public is positive as a whole. Our practice 
in the earlier period shows that launching the anticorruption 
struggle has been a popular move, which has played a positive 
role in promoting ties between the party and the masses, 
advancing reform and development, and safeguarding social and 
political stability. However, we should be aware that we have 
only scored a preliminary success that is far from meeting the 
people's expectations and Central Committee requirements. Work 
progress in various localities and departments has been uneven. 
Some comrades, including leading cadres, do not understand 
sufficiently the struggle's importance. As a result, they 
lacked initiative and strength in carrying out the struggle. 
Discipline was lax in some localities and departments. They 
failed to adopt forceful measures in handling cases. Therefore, 
we must remain sober, assume responsibility, resolutely carry 
out the anticorruption struggle, and strive to score new 
achievements. 
  Regarding the work of combating corruption and promoting 
honesty this year, Chen Huanyou said: First, we must continue 
to focus on the carrying out of three tasks. Resolute measures 
should be taken to encourage honesty and self-discipline among 
leading cadres. [passage omitted] Party and government leading 
cadres at and above the county and department levels should 
examine and rectify themselves. They should rectify whatever 
problems occur. They should promptly discover and solve 
existing problems by examining themselves, accepting supervision 
by the masses, and holding democratic meetings; and standardize 
their conduct in line with Central Committee and the provincial 
party committee provisions. We should continue to concentrate 
on the handling of major and important cases. Great efforts 
should be made to thoroughly investigate major cases of 
corruption that have been exposed. Under no circumstances 
should we let such cases go unhandled. Cases must be thoroughly 
investigated and settled no matter who is involved. We should 
never become soft-hearted and never allow official protection. 
Anyone who tries to protect law-breakers must be subject to 
party disciplinary action and punishment by law. [passage 
omitted] 
  Second, we should strive to solve problems by eliminating 
their root causes by gradually establishing an effective system 
or mechanism for preventing corruption. Various departments and 
units should conduct extensive education to promote party work 
style, honesty, and professional ethics; vigorously publicize 
and commend outstanding party members and cadres who are honest 
in carrying out their official functions and who work hard to 
serve the people; and encourage healthy trends. [passage 
omitted] 
  Third, we should strengthen leadership over the fight 
against 
corruption. Party and governments at all levels must take the 
fight against corruption as an important long-term task and 
always make it an important item on their agenda. [passage 
omitted] 
  At present, the general situation in the province is good. 
We have scored new progress in economic development, reform, 
and opening up to the outside world. We enjoy both political 
and social stability, but we are still facing many difficulties 
and contradictions in our advance. He said: We have very 
arduous tasks to do this year in pushing forward reform and 
development. As reform has entered a stage of tackling knotty 
problems, it is unprecedented in terms of its breadth, depth, 
intensity, and difficulties. In the course of advancing the 
reform, new problems and contradictions will inevitably emerge. 
Party committees, governments, and leading cadres at all levels 
must bear the responsibility, do their work well, and strive to 
consolidate and develop the good situation. [passage omitted] 
  In conclusion, Chen Huanyou stressed: In combating 
corruption, we must heed the overall interest of party work as a 
whole; eliminate major problems that affect the overall 
interest; set the task and goal for the anticorruption struggle 
for each stage; and integrate the fight against corruption with 
the implementation of the important party Central Committee and 
State Council policies, as well as with the major plans of the 
provincial party committee and government. [passage omitted] 
Through solid and effective work, we should enable the masses 
to realize that the main stream of our party ranks is good, that 
our party is determined to take effective action to combat 
corruption, and that progress in combating corruption has been, 
and is being, made step by step, thereby enhancing confidence in 
the fight against corruption and leading to a situation in which 
the party and the masses are united and the cadres and the 
masses are united and in which all in the province know they are 
in the same boat and should work hard together. 
  Thirty-three provincial discipline inspection commission 
members attended yesterday's meeting. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting concluded yesterday after adopting the 
"Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Jiangsu 
Provincial CPC Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Shanghai and Shandong Strengthen </F>
Exchanges and Cooperation"] 
  [Excerpts] Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC 
Committee; Huang Ju, Shanghai mayor; and their party recently 
went to Shandong to study and investigate the situation there at 
the invitation of Jiang Chunyun, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shandong CPC 
Committee. Wu Bangguo and Huang Ju went to Shandong to gain 
experiences from people in Shandong, express their gratitude to 
people in Shandong for continuously supporting Shanghai, enhance 
mutual understanding, and further strengthen exchanges and 
cooperation between Shanghai and Shandong. 
  During their study and investigation in Shandong, Jiang 
Chunyun and Executive Vice Governor Li Chunting introduced 
Shandong's experiences in carrying out reform, opening up to the 
outside world, promoting economic development, and maintaining 
social stability to the Shanghai comrades. Leading comrades of 
the two sides also exchanged views on how to implement the 
principles forwarded by the party Central Committee on "seizing 
the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability" and how to carry out 
common tasks and solve problems faced by the two sides. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Shanghai comrades were deeply impressed by the 
achievements made by people in Shandong in recent years. First, 
Shandong has kept the good trend of a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the economy. In 1987, Shandong doubled 
the gross output value [fan fan 5064 3972] three years ahead of 
schedule, and, in 1993, Shandong again doubled the gross output 
value [fan fan 5067 3972] seven years ahead of schedule. 
[passage omitted] Second, Shandong comrades have proceeded 
from actual conditions; have adopted strategic policies of 
"making all-round development, achieving breakthroughs in key 
areas, carrying out various tasks in a step by step manner, 
promoting lateral ties between the east and west parts of the 
province, and accelerating economic development"; have seriously 
implemented various development projects; and have been 
far-sighted in making strategic plans. [passage omitted] Third, 
Shandong comrades have attached great importance to 
infrastructure construction, and great progress has been made in 
the building of highways, electric power and communications 
facilities, ports, and railways. [passage omitted] Fourth, 
Shandong has made good progress in building up cities and towns. 
[passage omitted] Fifth, Comrades in Shandong have paid 
attention to the building of socialist spiritual civilization 
while developing the economy. [passage omitted] 
  Wu Bangguo said: The successful experience gained by 
Shandong comrades through their practice is worth learning by 
Shanghai. He also said that Shanghai would organize responsible 
comrades of concerned departments and districts and counties to 
visit Shandong to exchange experiences and study how to further 
expand cooperation between the two sides.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
leading commercial center, has designated six service industries 
as top-priority development industries to serve the whole of 
China, according to a municipal government official. 
  These industries are finance and insurance, commerce and 
trade, telecommunications and transportation, real estate, 
tourism and information, the official said. 
  He said the first three industries have become a "driving 
force" behind Shanghai's fast-growing service sector. The three 
industries furnished 73 percent of the sector's added value of 
57.2 billion yuan in 1993. 
  The service sector accounted for about 38 percent of the 
city's gross domestic product -- the value of goods and services 
produced -- in 1993, the official said. 
  The sector's ratio in Shanghai's economy is expected to grow 
to 40 percent this year, he added. 
  He described the growth of the finance and insurance 
industry 
in recent years as "remarkable." 
  The number of financial institutions in Shanghai soared to 
319 at the end of 1993 from 90 at the end of 1991, he said. 
  In addition, the added value of the financial and insurance 
industry shot up to 14.1 billion yuan in 1993 from roughly eight 
billion yuan in 1991. 
  The industry now accounts for nearly one-tenth of Shanghai's 
economy, he said. 
  The mushrooming of national markets has become the most 
vigorous driving force behind Shanghai's commercial and trade 
industry, he said. 
  For example, the turnover of the Shanghai Metals Exchange, 
the Shanghai Grain and Edible Oil Exchange, the Shanghai 
Petroleum Exchange and the Shanghai Stock Exchange marked 380 
billion yuan, 25 billion yuan, 54 billion yuan and 520 billion 
yuan, respectively. 
  The telecommunications and computer industries have been 
growing rapidly in recent years with the faster creation of a 
market economy in Shanghai, the official said. 
  For instance, the output value of the telecommunications 
industry doubled to 6.8 billion yuan in 1993. 
  Firms providing special services have been springing up over 
the past few years, he said. 
  The city now has some 1,000 information, consultancy and 
intermediate economic agencies. More than 5,000 people now work 
in hundreds of law and accountancy offices. 
  Moreover, Shanghai now has an agency which files customs 
declarations for clients; international service companies which 
provide all kinds of services to foreign investors; management 
companies which supply managerial personnel to customers; a 
vaults company which stores valuable goods for Chinese and 
overseas clients; and investment consultancy companies which 
provide information and data or make feasibility studies for 
investors from other parts of China and overseas.

<F P=106> ["Some Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress Standing </F>
Committee Regulations Concerning Strengthening Inspection and 
Supervision of the Implementation of Laws and Regulations 
adopted at the Eighth Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous 
Region People's Congress Standing Committee on 25 February 1994" 
-- XIZANG RIBAO headline] 
  [Text] To maintain the dignity of the law, promote the 
implementation of laws and regulations, and enable the Tibet 
Autonomous Region People's Congress Standing Committee to be 
more effective in inspecting and supervising the implementation 
of laws and regulations, the following regulations have been 
formulated, in accordance with the PRC Constitution as well as 
relevant laws and regulations and as a result of practical 
experiences summed up in recent years, to carry out the 
inspection and supervision of laws and regulations (hereafter 
abbreviated as law enforcement inspection): 
  1. The Tibet Autonomous Region People's Congress Standing 
Committee and special Tibet People's Congress committees conduct 
inspect and supervise the implementation of laws and regulations 
as well as resolutions and decisions with legal nature 
formulated by the National People's Congress [NPC], the NPC 
Standing Committee, the Tibet People's Congress, and the Tibet 
People's Congress Standing Committee. It is necessary to focus 
the law enforcement inspection of a period on such major issues 
as reform, opening up, socialist modernization, safeguarding the 
unification of the motherland, and enhancing the unity of all 
nationalities. Special efforts should be made to strengthen 
inspection and supervision of the enforcement of laws and 
regulations concerning a socialist market economy so as to 
protect and promote the development of a socialist market 
economy. 
  2. While inspecting law enforcement, the standing 
committee and all specialized committees of the Tibet People's 
Congress should primarily inspect and supervise how laws and 
regulations are being enforced by authorities in charge of law 
enforcement, and see to it that the regional government and its 
departments, the regional higher people's court, and the 
regional people's procuratorate take timely actions to deal with 
problems emerging in the enforcement of laws and regulations. 
The inspection groups should not handle problems directly. 
  3. Law enforcement inspection should proceed according to 
plan. The plan should include what, how, when, and where the 
inspection will be conducted, as well as other requirements. 
The Tibet People's Congress Standing Committee General Office 
should submit its plan to the standing committee chairman and 
vice chairmen meeting for approval and then submit the plan to 
the standing committee for the record. The regional people's 
congress standing committee general office, or the specialized 
people's congress committees, will notify the regional people's 
government and its related departments, the regional higher 
people's court, and the regional people's procuratorate, as well 
as standing committees of relevant municipal, county (or 
prefectural) people's congresses and liaison departments of the 
autonomous region in various prefectures about the inspection 
plan. 
  4. Inspection groups must be formed in such a manner that 
they are small but capable, efficient, and mobile. The regional 
people's congress standing committee inspection group should be 
composed of a head and several group members. The head should 
be selected from among standing committee members at the 
people's congress standing committee chairman and vice chairmen 
meeting. Specialized committees should form their own 
inspection groups. The standing committee and specialized 
committees may recruit deputies to the regional people's 
congress and relevant experts to be members of their inspection 
groups. They may also invite people of authorities in charge of 
enforcement of law and regulations, or people in charge of 
municipal and county (or prefectural) people's congress standing 
committees, to take part in inspection. 
  5. The inspection groups' members and staff personnel should 
be knowledgeable about the relevant laws, regulations, and 
policies. They should collect information about the enforcement 
of these laws and regulations and hear reports by authorities in 
charge of enforcement of laws and regulations. 
  6. The inspection groups should go deep into the realities 
of 
life and the masses at the grass-roots to understand the actual 
state of how laws and regulations are being enforced and to 
study enforcement problems through hearing reports, holding 
meetings, interviewing individuals, conducting surveys, and 
conducting on-the- spot study. Relevant departments and local 
authorities should support their work and provide them with 
actual information and other needed assistance. 
  7. After the inspection, inspection reports must be prepared 
under the supervision of the heads of inspection groups. 
Contents of the reports should include a comprehensive review 
of the ways the laws and regulations they have inspected were 
enforced; analysis of the causes of problems about the 
enforcement of laws and regulations; suggestions for improving 
law enforcement; and suggestions for amending, supplementing, 
and interpreting the laws and regulations. The reports must 
state facts objectively and truthfully, and they must not evade 
problems. 
  8. The regional people's congress standing committee 
chairman and vice chairmen meeting should request the standing 
committee to place on its agenda the law enforcement inspection 
report prepared by the regional people's congress standing 
committee inspection group. The meeting will decide whether it 
should request the standing committee to place the law 
enforcement reports prepared by the regional people's congress' 
specialized committees on its agenda. For those reports placed 
on the agenda, they should be delivered by the heads of the law 
enforcement inspection groups at standing committee meetings and 
examined and discussed there. People of authorities in charge of 
enforcement of laws and regulations should hear the views and 
answer questions at the meetings. Standing committee members 
may raise questions with regard to major issues concerning the 
enforcement of laws and regulations. When necessary, the 
standing committee should come up with a resolution. 
Specialized committees should examine and discuss their own law 
enforcement reports that are not placed on the standing 
committee's agenda. 
  9. The law enforcement inspection report examined by the 
regional people's congress standing committee and the views it 
expresses should be referred to authorities in charge of 
enforcement of laws and regulations, and these authorities 
should earnestly improve their law enforcement and, within six 
months, submit a written report to the standing committee about 
their improvement measures and the results they have achieved. 
When necessary, the regional people's congress standing 
committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting should request the 
standing committee place the report on its agenda for 
examination. For law enforcement reports examined by 
specialized committees of the regional people's congress as well 
as the views they have expressed in examining the reports, the 
specialized committees should refer them to authorities in 
charge of enforcement of laws and regulations, and these 
authorities should report to the specialized committees on how 
they have improved their way of enforcing laws. If the 
specialized committees are not satisfied with the reports, they 
may request the standing committee to reexamine the reports. 
  10. For major typical cases of lawlessness discovered during 
the inspection, the regional people's congress standing 
committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting may refer them to 
the specialized committees and the standing committee's 
administrative office for investigation. The investigation 
results should be reported to the regional people's congress 
standing committee chairman and vice chairmen meeting, and the 
meeting may request relevant authorities handle the problems 
within a specific period. The relevant authorities should 
report the results in a timely manner. When necessary, the 
regional people's congress standing committee chairman and vice 
chairmen meeting may request the standing committee examine the 
results. For specially major typical cases of lawlessness, the 
standing committee may exercise its legal rights and form an ad 
hoc committee or group to investigate the cases. The standing 
committee will not directly handle these cases, which should be 
dealt with by authorities in charge of enforcement of laws and 
regulations strictly in accordance with legal procedures. 
  11. The media should report and publicize in a timely manner 
the law enforcement inspection carried out by the regional 
people's congress standing committee. The regional people's 
congress general office may hold news briefings to inform the 
media about the inspection. The public may be informed of the 
major typical cases of lawlessness discovered during the course 
of inspection as well as the results of handling the cases.

<F P=106> [By Chen Decai (7115 1795 2088) and Reporter Liu Li (0491 </F>
0500): "Develop Rural Economy in an All-Around Manner and Make 
Peasants Prosper at an Earlier Date"] 
  [Text] Spring left and has returned. The busy season for 
spring farming has begun. To lose no time in successfully doing 
this year's agricultural production and rural work, He Zhukang, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, led the comrades in 
charge of pertinent provincial departments to the rural areas of 
Nongan, Qian Gorlos, Fuyu, Qianan, and Changling to conduct 
investigation and study and guide work shortly after the 
televised rural work conference held by the provincial party 
committee. In view of the current problems in rural areas, he 
emphasized: It is necessary to comprehensively analyze and 
acquire a better understanding of the current rural situation 
from the overall and long-term perspective, conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of the central rural work conferences 
and the rural work conference held by the provincial party 
committee, fully stimulate and develop peasants' enthusiasm, 
make the current spring farming successful, and aim at moderate 
prosperity and the market economy in deepening reform, 
restructuring the economy, and developing the rural economy in 
an all-round manner to promote Jilin's rural work to a new stage. 
  During the investigation and study period, Comrade He 
Zhukang 
went deep into townships, towns, township and village 
enterprises, and large households specializing in diverse 
production and livestock breeding to learn about their 
production and conditions of the people. He held a series of 
forums of various types to hear the opinions of the grass-roots 
levels and to pool the wisdom of the masses. He exchanged views 
with city, county, township, and village cadres as well as 
peasants on how to correctly assess the rural situation, how to 
make peasants affluent as soon as possible, how to promote 
agricultural modernization, the issues affecting peasants' 
enthusiasm and rural economic development, how to fully 
stimulate peasants' enthusiasm, how to strengthen leadership 
over rural work, and the specific problems to be addressed. He 
also held discussions with them to explore the ways to 
accelerate Jilin's agricultural development and to make peasants 
affluent and lead a moderately prosperous life at an early date. 
Comrade He Zhukang publicized the guidelines of the central 
rural work conference and the rural work conference of the 
provincial party committee wherever he went, summarized and 
extracted the rich experiences rural grass-roots cadres and 
peasants had created in the course of practice, and gave many 
important opinions on the work concerning rural areas, 
agriculture, and peasants. 
  He Zhukang said: Thanks to the attention of the central 
authorities and the hard work of cadres at all levels, peasants' 
enthusiasm for production is high. This has not been seen for 
many years. In addition, thanks to the deepening of reform, the 
concepts of the vast number of rural cadres and peasants is 
effecting a profound change, the correct principle of developing 
agriculture in an all-round manner as defined by the provincial 
party committee has become the people's common understanding, 
the idea of the market economy has begun to take root deeply in 
people's hearts, and it has become a common topic and urgent 
desire to attach importance to information, stress the market 
force, look forward to affluence, and march toward a moderately 
prosperous life. The overall rural economic development trend 
is very good, and the situation encouraging. We may say that 
the current rural reform and development are in a new crucial 
period, and, in particular, the rural economic development is in 
a period of transition. Party committees and governments at all 
levels should seize the current favorable opportunity to guide 
action according to circumstances, step up work, pay attention 
to implementing the guidelines of the central rural work 
conference and the rural work conference of the provincial party 
committee, fully stimulate peasants' enthusiasm, and promote 
faster economic development in rural areas. He pointed out: To 
develop rural economy further, we should first comprehensively 
and accurately analyze and acquire a better understanding of the 
rural situation, think more deeply over the development trend 
from the overall perspective, and be more farsighted. In 
particular, we should see the problems. We should not 
overestimate peasants' income, investment capacity, and 
agricultural development and be unrealistically optimistic. 
Judging from the entire situation, rural areas are far from 
being moderately prosperous, and tasks remain very arduous to 
achieve a moderately prosperous life ahead of schedule; capacity 
for sustained agricultural development has yet to be enhanced, 
and to enhance the capacity, to a certain extent, is more 
difficult than developing industry, involves more complicated 
factors, and takes more time; and how to protect and 
persistently develop peasants' enthusiasm remains an issue to be 
properly addressed. Therefore, leaders at all levels should 
further enhance their understanding of the position of 
agriculture as the foundation, have a strong sense of work 
responsibility and urgency, and, in compliance with the target 
of moderate prosperity and the requirement for the market 
economy, further emancipate the mind, deepen rural reform, 
liberate and develop rural productive forces, proceed from and 
aim at making peasants affluent and lead a moderately prosperous 
life when carrying out the work concerning rural areas, 
agriculture, and peasants, fully stimulate and develop peasants' 
enthusiasm, and consolidate and develop the excellent rural 
situation. 
  How to increase peasants' income and accelerate the pace of 
attaining a better-off level of moderate prosperity? This is an 
issue to which Comrade He Zhukang has paid great attention. He 
stressed on several occasions that the task of prime importance 
is to raise the agricultural labor productivity and let peasants 
have work to do all the year round and generate profits daily. 
The fundamental way out is to readjust the rural economic 
structure, and make full use of and tap all sorts of natural 
resources potentials in the rural areas. To readjust the 
structure, it is most important to proceed from our own reality, 
act in line with market demands, and accurately select items 
with our own advantages and our own characteristics. Each and 
every county, township, and village have different conditions. 
We must not strictly demand uniformity. It is better to 
develop things that suit a locality, grasp the characteristics, 
and gradually make it grow more intensive, specialized, and 
industrialized to form an optimal scale. Actively developing 
township enterprises is an important aspect in readjusting the 
structure. Developing township enterprises, however, needs 
certain conditions. As far as the broad masses of villages and 
households are concerned, during the initial stages, it is 
necessary to pay attention to seeking avenues that are mostly 
acceptable to peasants, and can be easily learned and 
understood, with less investment and risks but noticeable 
efficiency. Judging from the situation in various localities, 
animal husbandry, courtyard economy, and diversified 
undertakings can be initiated rapidly; they require less input 
and a low degree of socialization; peasants are able to easily 
approach them; and they have a vast market. They must be 
regarded as a major task during the current structural 
readjustment, and must be grasped well. In this aspect, we must 
pay attention to summing up and popularizing typical examples, 
and give play to their exemplary and initiating role. Peasants 
are most practical. When they see typical cases with their own 
eyes, they will follow them without having to be mobilized. 
Nongan and Qian Gorlos have done a good job in giving play to 
the role of typical examples and achieved structural 
readjustment and economic development rapidly. In the 
development of township industry, it is necessary to accurately 
select the projects, pay attention to quality, and not seek 
output value in a lopsided manner. Strenuous efforts should be 
made to build a batch of dragon-head enterprises, and through 
serial development, such as "all forms of integrated management 
of trade, industry, and agriculture, and the link-up operations 
of production, supply, and marketing," and such form as using 
companies to bring along peasant households, effectively link 
the production of all households with the domestic and foreign 
large markets, increase efficiency, and reduce risks. In the 
development of diversified economy and township enterprises, we 
must persist in taking a high starting point, try our best to 
adopt technologies of the present age, and have them attain the 
level of our time. To accelerate development, it is not 
realistic to do without advanced technology. 
  He Zhukang said: To readjust the industrial set-up and to 
raise the labor productivity in the rural areas, it is most 
important to raise the quality of peasants and solve the issue 
that some peasants want to become prosperous but they do not 
know how to do it and have no way to do it. Chairman Mao said 
during the 1950's, the serious issue is to educate peasants. 
This task has become more urgent today. Rural development 
should be finally determined by the enhancement of the overall 
quality of peasants. Nurturing a generation of peasants of a 
new type with scientific, technological, and cultural mind that 
fit the rural economic development, particularly the demands of 
the market economy, is an arduous task. Relevant departments at 
all levels should grasp it as a major task. In practice, all 
localities should have some good methods and experiences. For 
example, rural scientific and technological winter activities, 
peasants' vocational education, the "three plus one" middle 
school education, and "green certificates," are all feasible 
methods which must be upheld and popularized with continued 
efforts. Meanwhile, governments at all levels and all 
educational and administrative departments should put peasants' 
vocational and technical education high on the agenda and study 
specific implementation measures. It is necessary to train the 
existing labor forces in a planned manner, have plans, and set 
demands on them. We should give consideration to adding 
agricultural technology classes in the broad masses of rural 
schools starting in junior middle schools this year, in addition 
to running peasants' vocational and technical schools. Senior 
middle schools, if conditions permit, should popularize Jian's 
"three plus one" experience, strengthen agricultural science 
technological knowledge training among peasants of a new 
generation, and fundamentally intensify the agricultural 
development momentum. This is a foundation work. All 
localities must pay high attention to it and grasp it firmly and 
well. 
  He Zhukang pointed out: Peasants are the mainstay of the 
rural economic economy. The key to effecting a fundamental 
change in the rural outlook and accelerating the pace of 
agricultural modernization is to fully mobilize the broad masses 
of peasants and to give play to their enthusiasm. Cadres at all 
levels should firmly cultivate the viewpoint of believing in the 
masses and relying on them, change ideological concept, improve 
work style, and through emancipating the mind and deepening 
reform, break the shackle of traditional mechanism and the mode 
of thinking on peasants, give full play to the role of market 
mechanism as an incentive for peasants, give a free hand to 
peasants, and rely on the markets to solve the issue of funds 
and technology. It is necessary to strengthen peasants' 
organizational work, mobilize peasants through some carriers, 
and boost the mass enthusiasm of peasants. It is necessary to 
let peasants participate in policymaking in rural reform and 
development, strengthen democratic management, make the masses 
understand and support all sorts of rural work, and turn it into 
their conscious action. Peasants have tremendous wisdom and 
enthusiasm. If we let peasants participate in solving difficult 
problems in the rural areas and mobilize their endeavors, all 
problems can be solved and all undertakings will be a success. 
Many localities can prefulfill the great project of making the 
vast land of Jilin green in 10 years if the enthusiasm of the 
masses is mobilized. All levels should fully understand this. 
  Agriculture is a weak industry. In the process of transition 
into the market economic structure, the state should continue to 
implement all sorts of effective supporting and protective 
policies. But specific methods should be relatively changed in 
line with the new situation. Continued efforts should be made 
to reduce the burdens of peasants, and prevent the 
"reappearance" of burdens. It is necessary to conscientiously 
resolve the issue on hot topics which the masses of people in 
the rural areas have paid close attention, do practical things 
for peasants, help them eliminate misgivings, and enable them to 
participate in the development of the rural market economy with 
all-out efforts. 
  Developing and expanding the collective economy is the 
material basis for forming cohesion of the rural party 
organizations and appeal of grass-roots cadres, the fundamental 
way for reducing peasants' burdens and resolving the rural 
social security issue, and an important means for enabling rural 
grass-roots cadres to lead the rural economy under market 
economic conditions. On his way, He Zhukang repeatedly explored 
ways of developing the village collective economy along with 
rural cadres. He said: What can be managed by the peasant 
households can also be managed by the village collectives. One 
of the important targets of evaluating rural work and the 
building of grass-roots organizations is to see whether they 
have developed a collective economy. All localities should 
adopt measures, be determined to make all villages have 
collective economic units within the next two years, and enable 
all villages across the province each with an annual revenue of 
over 20,000 yuan at the least. In addition to formulating 
specific plans, we should also implement target management and 
work in a down-to-earth manner. Regarding those villages whose 
collecive economy lacks development, we should organize efforts 
to study them one by one so that all villages have collective 
economic development items. Concerning villages with weak 
leadership, we should make up our mind to send cadres to assume 
posts and to define work objectives for changing their poverty 
and backward outlook. In addition to developing their economy, 
we should help them cultivate a good party branch secretary and 
form a good leading body. We should care for the living of 
peasant households with special difficulties, analyze their 
situation one by one, give them suitable remedies, and adopt 
practical and effective methods, such as giving social mutual 
assistance, encouraging them to engage in development and 
production, and providing them relief by the civil 
administrations, in an effort to guarantee their basic life. 
  He Zhukang pointed out: In developing rural market economy, 
we must invigorate the rural commodity circulation and pay 
attention to cultivating and building rural markets, including 
rural internal market cultivation and formation. The key to 
linking production with supply and marketing lies in the dragon 
head which means marketing, and market is the crux. At present, 
the information for peasants is not quick and accurate and their 
products are unmarketable. In a final analysis, these problems 
are caused by the uncultivated and imperfect rural markets. It 
is necessary to exert efforts to develop the market. In this 
aspect, we should broaden our thinking, not only make good use 
of the existing markets but also develop new markets, develop 
small cities and towns in a planned manner, and realize an 
integration of rural and urban efforts. This is not only a 
necessity for developing the market economy but also the only 
way for enabling peasants to become prosperous without making 
them leave the rural areas. 
  During discussions with rural cadres, He Zhukang repeatedly 
emphasized: New ideas and new methods are needed in leading 
rural economic development. The past traditional leadership 
methods characterized by giving orders, defining plans, and 
hastening production and harvesting should be changed into ones 
emphasizing guidance, support for peasants to enter the market, 
and efforts to address the difficulties and problems in 
developing the market economy. We should provide peasants with 
market information, help them explore the market, establish the 
socialized service system well, and render good service prior 
to, during, and after production. In the transition to the 
market economy, new conditions and new problems will emerge one 
after another, of which many will be ones we do not understand. 
Therefore, to lead the market economy, cadres at all levels 
should intensify study, and those in the dark are in no position 
to light the way for others. They should study the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the knowledge 
on the socialist market economy, and modern scientific and 
technological knowledge. The recently published two books, 
"What Is the Socialist Market Economy" and "Modern Scientific 
and Technological Knowledge," are very good teaching materials, 
and all levels should earnestly study them. We should attach 
equal importance to the two civilizations and strengthen 
grass-roots organizations. In particular, we should strengthen 
the activities of party branches and leading party groups, hold 
democratic meetings frequently and party branch sessions at 
regular intervals and fully develop the role of party 
organizations as leadership cores and the role of party members 
as leaders and models. We should pay attention to establishing 
village plans and village rules and regulations, crack down on 
various criminal offenses, and check evil trends and bad customs 
and habits, such as gambling, superstitious activities, and 
lavish weddings and funerals, and transform social traditions so 
that peasants can live and work in peace and contentment. 
  He Zhukang also emphasized on many occasions: A pressing 
task is to concentrate efforts on spring farming and plant crops 
well to stabilize Jilin's grain production. As 60 to 70 percent 
of peasants' current income comes from grain production, rural 
areas will be stabilized when attention is given to grain 
production. It is hoped that all localities will lose no time 
in spring farming and lay a good foundation for this year's 
bumper grain harvest. 
  During the discussions in various localities, He Zhukang 
affirmed the work of rural grass-roots cadres on many occasions 
and expressed gratitude to their industrious work. He said: We 
should both set strict demands on grass-roots cadres and fully 
trust them to protect their enthusiasm well. Grass-roots work 
is very complicated, and some of it is very difficult. We 
should have a full understanding of the difficulties of 
grass-roots cadres, support their work, and ensure the 
implementation of the party's line, principles, and policies in 
rural areas. 
  Participating in the investigation and study activities were 
responsible comrades of the general office and the rural work 
office of the provincial party committee, the provincial 
agricultural bank, provincial agricultural department, 
provincial water resources department, provincial township 
enterprise bureau, and provincial supply and marketing 
cooperative. Responsible comrades of Songyuan city party 
committee and government participated in the inspections and 
discussions in the various counties and districts of Songyuan 
city. Wang Yunkun, standing committee member of the provincial 
party committee and secretary of the Changchun city party 
committee, and pertinent comrades of Changchun city party 
committee and government joined the investigation and study 
activities in Nongan.

<F P=106> [Interview by Reporter Yu Shui (0060 3055) with He Zhukang, </F>
secretary of Jilin Provincial CPC Committee, on Jilin's 
implementation of the "outlines for China's educational reform 
and development" and "law on teachers" on 21 April] 
  [Text] [Yu Shui] How has Jilin implemented the "outlines 
for China's educational reform and development" promulgated by 
the CPC Central Committee and the State Council? 
  [He Zhukang] The "outlines for China's educational reform 
and development" promulgated by the party Central Committee and 
the State Council is a very important document, and it 
represents an important measure adopted by the party and state 
to accelerate the modernization drive overall. Comprehensive 
implementation of the "outlines" is a major task for our party 
committees and governments at all levels. The provincial party 
committee and government have attached great importance to 
implementation of the "outlines" and the "law on teachers" and 
adopted the following three major measures. 
  First, we explicitly defined the strategy of "developing 
Jilin with science, technology, and education" at the sixth 
provincial party congress held in April 1993 and regarded 
education as a strategic priority. Because enthusiasm alone is 
not enough for our endeavor to build a developed border province 
near the sea, we need the necessary conditions and ability to 
accomplish this endeavor and, more fundamentally, an overall 
education level that is compatible with it. The endeavor of 
building a developed border province near the sea itself 
includes developing education and relying on education. 
Manpower resources equipped with modern scientific knowledge 
constitute the foundation for us to achieve economic prosperity, 
and various forms of education are the means to strengthen this 
foundation. After the party congress, six leaders of the 
provincial party committee have gone to schools of higher 
learning and relevant departments to conduct investigation and 
study and hear opinions on how to develop Jilin with science, 
technology, and education. The provincial party committee holds 
that to implement the strategy of "developing Jilin with 
science, technology, and education," we should respect knowledge 
and trained personnel and give full play to the role of 
intellectuals. Therefore, the provincial party committee and 
government decided to issue special allowances to the 15 
academicians and one foreign academician of the Chinese Academy 
of Sciences and 21 advisers to doctoral candidates who were 
working in Jilin. Such an act was the first of its kind in the 
country. 
  Second, the provincial government held a working conference 
at an opportune time in May 1993 on raising education funds 
through various channels and on improving teaching facilities. 
It studied ways to correctly handle the relations between 
reducing peasants' burdens and developing rural education. 
While resolutely carrying out central guidelines on reducing 
peasants' burdens, we persistently raised education funds from 
various channels and formulated 10 special policy measures for 
raising education funds, thus maintaining the healthy 
development of rural education. 
  Third, to comprehensively implement the "outlines," the 
provincial party committee and government held a provincial 
education work conference to study and define the "several 
opinions of the Jilin Provincial CPC Committee and People's 
Government concerning implementation of the 'outlines for 
China's educational reform and development'" (consisting of 30 
articles in six parts). I spoke on four issues at that 
conference, and pertinent leading comrades of the provincial 
party committee also attended and gave speeches. These measures 
have effectively promoted Jilin's educational reform and 
development. 
  [Yu Shui] What practical work have the provincial party 
committee and government done for education since the 
promulgation of the "outlines for China's educational reform and 
development?" 
  [He Zhukang] We have firmly focused on increasing 
educational 
investment and improving the status and material benefits of 
teachers when doing practical work for education. At last 
year's provincial education work conference, I said: "Shortage 
of funds will be a long-term problem, and the key is how to use 
funds and make the limited funds play a still greater role," and 
"we should firmly establish such a guiding idea that we must 
promote education even if we have to do so by cutting expenses 
in other fields, and we should be determined to achieve success 
in education, a major undertaking that concerns future 
generations." What I said has become the common understanding 
in the province, and party committees and governments at all 
levels have adopted every means to increase educational 
investment despite strained financial resources. 
  --The provincial government strived to increase the budgeted 
educational funds, which showed a 20.9 percent increase in 1993 
as compared with 1992. 
  --The provincial government decided to establish two special 
funds for establishing key schools of higher learning and key 
disciplines in the province and for making the nine-year 
compulsory education universal. 
  --The provincial government formulated a package of 
policies on raising education funds from various channels, 
which, when successfully implemented, will enable Jilin to 
increase its educational investment by 500 million yuan every 
year. We increased the 2-percent urban education surcharge to 3 
percent, making the total surcharge increase by 27 percent over 
the preceding year; we extended fund raising in cities, and 58.3 
percent more funds were collected when compared with the 
preceding year; we collected from hotel guests an education 
surcharge to be used in developing education; fees for shops, 
environmental benefits, pollution, and land transfer were 
exempted, and fees for supporting urban facilities were reduced 
or postponed with government approval when building colleges and 
primary and middle schools and building houses for school 
administrative staff and teachers to lower the construction cost 
by over 100 yuan per square meter, which was equivalent to 
making an investment of 100 million yuan in the whole year; a 
part of the fines and confiscated funds from industrial and 
commercial units was set aisde for educational development; 
tuitions and fees for noncompulsory education and compulsory 
education were adjusted to increase by 30 percent over the 
preceding year; tax breaks were continued for the industries 
developed by schools of various categories to make the net 
income from the industries developed by primary and middle 
schools and secondary specialized schools in the province reach 
300 million yuan, ranking the per capita income of students 
first in the country. 
  --We supported relevant schools of higher learning to 
cooperate and recommended the cooperated universities to first 
enter the state's "211 project." 
  --In view of the current price rises, we allocated special 
living expense allowance to the particularly difficult students 
of colleges and universities. 
  To improve the status and material benefits of teachers, we 
have done the following: 
  --The provincial party committee and government decided in 
June 1993 to issue government special allowance to a small 
number of high-grade intellectuals beginning 1 July and equally 
treated the high-grade intellectuals of the units under 
ministries and those under the province. Academicians of the 
Chinese Academy of Sciences were given 1,000 yuan each per 
month, and advisers to doctoral candidates were given 300 yuan. 
  --Last year, we selected 108 special-grade primary and 
middle 
school teachers and 33 outstanding school masters who enjoyed 
the benefit of special-grade primary and middle school teachers 
(80 yuan of allowance per person every month). 
  --We accelerated construction of houses for the 
administrative staff and teachers of urban colleges and 
universities as well as primary and middle schools. Thanks to 
the preferential policies formulated by the provincial party 
committee and government, housing construction for the 
administrative staff and teachers of the colleges and 
universities as well as primary and middle schools in the 
province made new headway. New houses totaling 321,000 square 
meters were built for the teachers of the schools of higher 
learning under the province; and 349,000 square meters of new 
houses were built for primary and middle school teachers to make 
the per capita living space 6.8 square meters. 
  --We strived to improve the material benefits of the 
teachers 
supported by local people. The provincial party committee and 
government demanded that the wage of such teachers, which 
includes unified township allocation and state subsidies, not be 
lower than two-thirds of that of the teachers paid by the 
government. In the past three years, 5,400 outstanding teachers 
supported by local people became the teachers supported by the 
government after appraisal. 
  [Yu Shui] What issues should we emphasize in our current 
efforts to implement the "outlines for China's educational 
reform and development?" 
  [He Zhukang] In my opinion, we should emphasize three issues 
when studying, publicizing, and implementing the "outlines for 
China's educational reform and development" at present and for 
some time to come. First, our understanding should be in place. 
When implementing the "outlines," we should understand not only 
the strategic position of education but, more importantly, the 
new issues and new conditions we encounter in accelerating 
educational reform and development. Guided by the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line, the "outlines" summarized the experiences in 
educational reform and development gained in the past four 
decades and more, especially since the third plenary session of 
the 11th party Central Committee, analyzed the situation in 
education work, and put forward the targets, strategies, guiding 
principles, and many important policy measures for China's 
educational development for the 1990's and even the early 21st 
century. The "outlines" are a programmatic document guiding 
China's educational reform and development. 
  It should be 
said that party committees and governments at all levels in the 
province have attached great importance to the study and 
implementation of the "outlines" over the past year. Propaganda 
and education departments of the province held training for 
county, city, and district heads in charge of education and 
carried out mass study and mass discussion on the education 
front, thus promoting Jilin's education work to a new height. 
Judging from the situation in the entire province, however, 
progress in the study and publicity of the "outlines" varied 
from place to place. The education front did a better job, but 
as far as the entire society was concerned, study, publicity, 
and implementation of the "outlines" remained a long-term task. 
We are carrying out socialist modernization in a country with a 
large population, relatively insufficient resources, and a 
rather backward economy. To attain the grand target of 
modernization and further liberate and develop productive 
forces, we should develop education on a priority basis, raise 
the quality of laborers, and turn the heavy burden of population 
into an advantage in personnel resources. Therefore, an urgent 
task for the entire party, entire society, and all the people is 
to study well and conscientiously implement the "outlines." We 
should include the study of the "outlines" in the political 
study of party committees, governments, enterprises, and 
institutions so that every citizen will know and understand the 
"outlines." 
  Second, investment should be in place. To develop education 
on a priority basis means to increase educational investment on 
a priority basis. All undertakings need to be developed, but 
our financial resources are limited. This is a contradiction, 
which exists not only today but will also exist for a very long 
time to come. We should not wait until economy is developed to 
develop education. Otherwise, developing the economy will also 
become very difficult. Therefore, governments at all levels, 
despite their limited financial resources, should strive to have 
education funds increase at a higher rate than the "increase 
rates of the two other fields." Educational development is also 
an undertaking of the masses. We should mobilize the masses to 
continue donations for education, raise funds for developing 
schools, expand financial resources, and collect education funds 
from various channels. Through the efforts of all fields, we 
should ensure an increase in education funds every year and 
tackle the fund shortage as much as possible. 
  Third, our work should be in place. Education is the 
foundation for the undertakings of vital and lasting importance. 
Now that we have the "outlines" and the blueprint, the key is 
for leaders at all levels to meticulously organize their 
implementation. As far as governments are concerned, they 
should earnestly do more work and practical work for educational 
development. There are many difficulties in developing 
education, which cannot be resolved by teachers, schools, and 
even education departments alone. Government help is required. 
For instance, they should organize and coordinate efforts to 
address the issues on the preferential policies on developing 
education, on improvement of teaching facilities, improvement of 
the social status and material benefits of teachers, and the 
favorable conditions for the social practices of college, middle 
school, and primary school students. Not only should the 
leaders in charge of education take care of this matter, but 
also other leading cadres should render help so that all 
comrades are assigned the tasks and responsibilities for doing 
practical work in education. 
  The tasks to implement the "outlines" are still heavier for 
the vast number of education workers on the education front. 
When studying the "outlines," education workers should further 
correct their ideas for education and for running schools, 
persist in the comprehensive moral, intellectual, physical, and 
aesthetic development, put moral development particularly in the 
first place in school work, and train the necessary qualified 
personnel in the socialist modernization drive. We should 
extensively educate students with modern history, contemporary 
history, national situation, patriotism, collectivism, 
socialism, and the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation. 
Currently, we should attach importance to and intensify 
vocational and technical education, provide vocational courses 
for middle school students, and ensure that students learn some 
skills before employment. We should improve the quality and 
efficiency of education in an all-round manner, continuously 
upgrade the quality of teachers, deepen the reform of education 
and teaching, and comprehensively implement the party's 
education policies to turn the next generation we are training 
into the builders and successors who will carry on our causes 
into the 21st century. This is where China's hope lies.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Yan Fengli (2518 7685 0448) and </F>
correspondent Cen Daokun (1478 6670 0981): "Abulaiti Abudurexiti 
Stresses Foreign Affairs Work Must Open up Wider and Serve the 
Economy"] 
  [Text] On 31 March, a regional conference of directors of 
foreign affairs offices ended. Addressing the closing ceremony, 
Abulaiti Abudurexiti, Xinjiang Autonomous Regional People's 
Government chairman, called for seizing the opportunity, opening 
up wider, and successfully handling foreign affairs work to 
promote Xinjiang's rapid and highly efficient economic 
development. 
  He said: Xijiang is located at a hot-point region for 
attracting foreign funds. It is necessary for foreign affairs 
departments at all levels to clearly understand this trend, 
emancipate their minds, boldly blaze new trails, enhance their 
consciousness of having foreign affairs work serve economic 
construction, and focus attention on the enthusiasm of all 
fields of endeavor for contacts with foreign countries. We must 
make full use of foreign affairs departments' characteristics of 
having extensive, multiple channels for contacts with foreign 
countries to vigorously establish links for economic 
departments. We must step up propaganda abroad to let the world 
understand Xinjiang. We must improve contacts with Chinese 
embassies and consulates abroad and strive to win their support 
and help for Xinjiang's opening up wider and conducting economic 
activities and trade. We must successfully build and manage 
ports open to the outside world, strengthen the building of 
spiritual civilization at these ports, increase their cargo 
handling capabilities, and guarantee smooth transportation to 
these ports to provide excellent services for opening up. 
  Xinjiang has established economic, cultural, and other ties 
with more than 60 countries and regions, including the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, Japan, the United States, 
Western European countries, Hong Kong, and Macao. Abulaiti 
Abudurexiti said: It is necessary for all foreign affairs 
departments to cement ties with old friends, make more new 
friends, and establish a reliable network for contacts with 
foreign countries. While consolidating the existing markets, 
efforts must be made to expand the share of markets captured in 
Japan, the United States, Hong Kong, and Central Asia and to 
vigorously open up new markets in South Asia, the ROK, Russia, 
Eastern and Western Europe, and West Asia. While attracting 
foreign funds, we must continue to improve the orientation for 
industries, treat the new high technology industry and technical 
transformation of the old enterprises as the focal points for 
encouraging investments, and pay attention to the percentage of 
foreign funds that have been remitted to their recipients as 
well as the quality and efficiency of the utilization of foreign 
funds. He also stressed: We must open our doors wider to the 
outside world, successfully attract foreign businessmen and 
their capital, and strive to make the 1994 Urumqi Trade Fair an 
even greater success.

  [Text] The first music radio station in China's 
northwestern region, the Xinjiang People's Radio Broadcasting 
Network's music station, formally started to broadcast yesterday 
in Urumqi. 
  Party and government leaders of the autonomous region, 
including Janabil, Amudun Niyaz, Feng Dazhen, (Paxia Yixia), and 
other comrades went to the station to extend their 
congratulations. 
  Janabil, deputy secretary of the regional party committee 
and 
chairman of the regional committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, expressed warm 
congratulations to the station on behalf of the regional party 
committee and the regional government at a ceremony for the 
start of broadcasting by the music station. 
  Janabil said: The music station should publicize the main 
theme and adhere to the correct media orientation like the 
people's station and the economic affairs station. It should 
broadcast more musical works which can represent China's 
national tradition and spirit and the atmosphere of the times, 
as well as famous and artistic Chinese and foreign music and 
songs. The music station and the people's station should take 
an active attitude toward organizing the creation of more 
musical works which can encourage people of various 
nationalities to work hard and make progress and satisfy the 
increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the people. 
  In conclusion, Janabil expressed his hope that various 
circles in society would vigorously support the music station. 
He said that concerned departments should strengthen their 
leadership over the music station while comrades of the music 
station should work hard and find ways and means to accomplish 
the propaganda task entrusted to them by the party and the 
government.

<F P=106> [Report: "The Central Authorities Have Decided To Form a </F>
Group To Handle Taiwan-Related Contingencies"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 1 May (WEN WEI PO)--An authoritative 
person revealed here that the central authorities had recently 
decided to form a Taiwan-related contingencies group, which 
principal leaders of the mainland Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait will be invited to join. With the 
establishment of this new organization, if contingencies occur 
in the future, more transparent methods can be adopted to handle 
them. 
  Reports have indicated that, when talking about the Qiandao 
Hu incident a few days ago, the high-level central leadership 
hoped to draw a lesson from handling the Qiandao Hu case. They 
pointed out that the relevant situation should be promptly 
reported to the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation and that 
media reports should be provided with more transparency and 
efficiency. The locality itself lacked experience in handling 
such incidents, and the Qiandao Hu case was handled 
inappropriately. In dealing with the case, no consideration was 
given to its particular nature. Therefore, there is a need to 
establish a new procedure for promptly reporting contingencies 
to the higher authorities and immediately releasing information 
abroad, allowing reporters to provide ongoing coverage to 
increase the transparency of the procedures for handling these 
contingencies. 
  High levels of the central leadership invited the relevant 
experts to assess the negative impact of the Qiandao Hu incident 
on relations between the two sides. The relevant experts said 
that the incident will have a short-term negative impact on the 
two sides' relations, but it will not affect the two sides' 
relations too much in the long run, because Taiwan's economic 
development requires assistance from the mainland, and Taiwan 
businessmen will not easily give up the opportunity to invest on 
the mainland. 
  The relevant experts said that the Qiandao Hu incident has 
had such great repercussions in Taiwan due to the involvement of 
the Taiwan authorities and the Taiwan independence forces.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Li Xiaozhun (2621 1321 6150): "The Qiandao </F>
Hu Murder Case Provides Food for Thought for the Two Sides of 
the Strait"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 26 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
mainland employed 4,000 people in the investigation into the 
Qiandao Lake murder case, which has attracted attention at home 
and abroad, and the whole truth of the case has come out. The 
Zhejiang local procuratorial organs intend to conduct a public 
trial of the three suspects in the near future. To dispel 
doubts and misgivings, and to enable the people concerned to 
understand the details of the case, the mainland has sincerely 
asked Taiwan to send specialists and has invited relatives of 
the murdered to attend the trial as observers. The mainland has 
made utmost efforts to handle the Qiandao Lake murder case, and 
has made public the details of the case. This probably will be 
helpful in dispelling various doubts and reactions. However, in 
handling the Qiandao Lake murder case, differences and 
misunderstandings occurred as a result of differences in ideas 
and approach. This has provided people food for thought and 
examination. 
  The Qiandao Lake murder case was originally a chance 
occurrence and an accident in tourism. Had the mainland side 
followed more appropriate procedures in investigation, gathering 
evidence, and solving the case, or had each side understood and 
respected the different approaches of the other, public feeling 
on the island would not have been aroused, and the press' 
misunderstanding that the mainland "intentionally withheld the 
truth" could have been avoided. 
  As a matter of fact, viewed from the process of solving the 
Qiandao Lake murder case, the mainland had no intention of 
withholding the truth. On the contrary, it exerted its utmost 
efforts to bring the whole truth of the case to light as soon as 
possible. After the Qiandao Lake murder case occurred, 
President Jiang Zemin immediately gave instructions on "solving 
the case within a time limit," and "absolutely not withholding 
the truth." This was something rare in handing cases of chance 
occurrence on the mainland, was enough to show the extreme 
concern and attention at the high level over this serious murder 
case, which involved the lives of 32 compatriots of Taiwan and 
the mainland. Throughout the course of solving the case, 4,000 
people from the central and local governments carried out 
investigations and gathered evidence, day and night, and 
succeeded in solving this complicated and confusing case within 
the short span of 17 days. The details then were made public in 
good time. It should be said that the mainland took an active 
and responsible attitude in handling the Qiandao Lake murder 
case, so why have there been queries overseas, despite the 
efforts exerted? 
  Perhaps this is because the idea and approach in handling 
cases of chance occurrence of the mainland are different from 
those of the other side of the strait, thus making people feel 
at a loss as to what to do. Generally speaking, in handling 
similar cases on the mainland, especially the rare Qiandao Lake 
murder case -- a case of robbery, murder, and arson -- a case is 
made public usually on the basis of having a clear and 
unambiguous grasp of the whole story, testimonies of witnesses, 
and material evidence. In the course of solving a case, the 
press usually treats the case carefully and does not report 
anything about it so as to avoid leaking the details of the case 
and to prevent the criminals and suspects from taking advantage 
of such leaks to create difficulties for solving the case. On 
the contrary, the Taiwan side will make a case of chance 
occurrence widely known as soon as it happens. Any clue, be it 
useless or important, will be reported in full detail. The 
people on the island seem to be quite accustomed to this 
practice, and because of this, they could not understand, were 
resentful about, and raised questions on the mainland's entirely 
different way of dealing with the Qiandao Lake murder case. 
  In fact, as for dealing with a case of chance occurrence, 
the 
mainland's way of handing a case carefully and of not rashly 
making it public should give no cause for much criticism. On 
the contrary, immediately making public whatever is discovered, 
before the details of a case are clear, may not be conducive to 
the investigation and solution of a case. Last year, the Yin 
Ching-feng ammunitions purchase-homicide case occurred in 
Taiwan. The prosecution was greatly troubled in the course of 
solving the case because the mass media competed with one 
another to report whatever traces and clues were discovered. 
The authorities concerned on the island did not agree twith 
such so-called "complete transparency" of news reporting, either. 
  However, since the Qiandao Lake murder case involved the 
lives of compatriots on both sides of the strait, it attracted 
great attention, both at home and abroad. We should show 
understanding and sympathy for the relatives of the murdered, 
who were anxious to learn the details of the case. Had the 
mainland allowed people to report on details that would not have 
affected the solution of the case and on the progress in solving 
the case, unnecessary misunderstandings might have been reduced 
or even avoided. 
  Now that the whole truth of the Qiandao Lake murder case has 
come out, the knot in the hearts of the people on both sides of 
the strait should be untied. However, in handling special cases 
similar to the Qiandao Lake murder case in the future, how both 
sides of the strait should readjust their respective ways of 
handling matters so as to avoid misunderstandings. This is a 
question both sides of the strait should think about and to 
which they should give an answer.

  [Text] Beijing, April 30 (XINHUA) -- A signed article 
published in Beijing-based newspapers today warns to be vigilant 
against any attempt to undermine relations across the Taiwan 
Straits by utilizing the "Qiandao Lake incident". 
  It says that peaceful reunification is an inevitable trend 
in 
accord with the desires of the people across the straits. To 
achieve this goal as early as possible, compatriots across the 
straits have made great mutual efforts to bring about good 
relations across the straits. 
  The article written by Guo Taiwen says that no small efforts 
have been expended in bringing the relations across the straits 
to the present stage, adding that all people who hope for 
reunification should treasure the established relations. 
  It points out that any activities aimed at damaging the 
relations between the people across the straits, which are as 
close as flesh and blood, will not enjoy popular support. 
  It says that all compatriots across the straits are deeply 
grieved at the Qiandao Lake incident that caused 32 deaths, 
including 24 Taiwan tourists and eight mainlanders, when the 
tourist boat they boarded was robbed and set on fire in East 
China's Zhejiang Province on March 31. 
  And at the same time people also felt relieved that the 
robbery case has been uncovered, the article says. 
  The article says that after the incident took place the 
central government has shown great concern over it, instructing 
the Zhejiang Provincial Government to investigate and uncover 
the case as soon as possible. 
  Local public security institutions had worked hard and 
announced after 17 days of investigation that it was a case of 
murder, robbery and arson and three suspects had been arrested, 
it says. 
  The article criticized some officials and people in Taiwan 
for their spreading slanderous rumors to whip up resentful 
sentiments so as to sabotage the relations across the straits. 
  It says that it is understandable that people said extreme 
and inappropriate words when they were unaware of the truth of 
the event. But, the article warns that there are really a 
handful of people, who with ulterior motives have tried their 
best to undermine the good ties across the straits.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station editor (Yu Xin): "Taiwan </F>
Businessmen's Zeal for Investment on the Mainland Remains 
Unchanged"; from the "News and Current Events" program] 
  [Excerpts] Taiwan's Minister of Economic Affairs Jiang 
Bingkun [Chiang Ping-kun] said recently that since the Qiandao 
Lake boat incident had gradually cooled down, the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs had resumed its normal routine in handling the 
mainland affairs. On 22 April alone, the Investment Examination 
Committee of the Ministry approved 91 applications for 
investment on the mainland, with a total investment of more than 
1.4 billion new Taiwan dollars. In addition, it also approved 
for the first time three requests for importing technology from 
the mainland. These were the first batch of investment 
applications approved by the ministry since the Qiandao Lake 
boat incident. They show that the cross-strait economic 
exchanges and trade cannot be cut off by the boat incident. 
Figures for the first quarter published recently by Taiwan's 
Ministry of Economic Affairs show that Taiwan businessmen's zeal 
for investment on the mainland remains unchanged and the 
investment has not decreased, despite certain man-made political 
factors. 
  A Taiwan official said: The attractiveness of the mainland 
market and investment is so great that it is very difficult for 
the government to discourage the investment. If the government 
tries to control the investment by mandate, tens of thousands of 
Taiwan businessmen will go underground and become unmanageable. 
[passage omitted] The cross-strait economic exchanges and 
cooperation have become irreversible. [passage omitted] 
  In recent years, the Taiwan authorities have spared no 
efforts to advocate a southward venture policy, encouraging 
enterprises to invest in Southeast Asia. The purpose of the 
policy is to disperse Taiwan businessmen's investment and to 
curb their investment and reduce their economic dependency on 
the mainland. The policy is also designed to serve the 
political purpose of creating two Chinas or one China and one 
Taiwan. 
  Taiwan Legislative Yuan member (Yu Mu-lin) recently made an 
urgent interpellation about the anti-Chinese riot in Indonesia 
and pointed out: The southward venture policy is, out of a 
political consideration, designed to curb the mainland 
investment craze. However, under such a policy, the investment 
is made in high-risk regions and the people are bound to suffer 
inestimable losses in the future. 
  Some power holders in Taiwan are taking advantage of the 
Qiandao Lake boat incident to instigate hatred among the people 
for the mainland and are calling for suspension of the 
cross-strait exchanges. Their purpose is to dampen the 
enthusiasm for cross-strait economic exchanges, and there is 
also a political objective behind this purpose. Neither the 
people of insight nor the media in Taiwan want to see the 
escalation of the Qiandao Lake boat incident to a political 
event between the two sides. If the cross-strait exchanges go 
backward in an all-round way due to the tourism mishap, many 
problems will crop up. For one, Taiwan will be unable to cope 
with a situation in which the mutually complementary and 
mutually beneficial cross-strait relations are restored to 
relations of confrontation. A situation like that is definitely 
not what the people on both sides of the strait love to see.

  [Text] Taipei, May 4 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui left 
for Nicaragua Wednesday [4 May] morning on the first day of his 
13-day, four-country overseas tour. 
  During the next two weeks, Li will pay official visits to 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa, and Swaziland. All four 
countries maintain close official relations with the Republic of 
China [ROC]. 
  Traveling with Li are Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, 
Governor of the Central Bank of China Samuel Shieh, Chairman of 
the Council for Economic Planning and Development Hsiao 
Wan-chang, Executive Yuan Advisor Jeffrey Koo, Presidential Vice 
Secretary-General Raymond Tai, and the directors of the Foreign 
Ministry's Central and South American Affairs Department Yen 
Ping-fan and African Affairs Department Du Ling. 
  Li will make a brief stopover in Hawaii to refuel before 
flying to Managua, Nicaragua. Chairman Natale Bellocchi of the 
American Institute in Taiwan will meet Li in Hawaii during the 
stopover. 
  Li is scheduled to arrive in Managua Wednesday afternoon. He 
will spend two days there. 
  Li will then fly to Costa Rica to attend the Sunday 
inauguration of President-Elect Jose Maria Figueres, and later 
fly to South Africa, where on May 10 he will attend the 
inauguration of newly-elected South African President Nelson 
Mandela. He will travel to Swaziland on May 11. 
  During his tour, Li will sign joint communiques with his 
counterparts in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Swaziland to 
strengthen bilateral ties. 
  This will be Li's first official overseas tour since he 
assumed the presidency in 1988. He paid unofficial visits to 
Singapore in 1989 and to the Philippines, Indonesia, and 
Thailand in February this year. All four Southeast Asian 
countries recognize Beijing while maintaining close economic 
ties with Taiwan. 
  Li is scheduled to return to Taipei May 16.

  [Text] Taipei, April 27 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Wednesday [27 April] formally announced the itinerary 
for President Li Teng-hui's trip to Central America and Africa. 
  Li will first head to Managua, Nicaragua next Wednesday on 
board a China Airlines chartered flight. He will then visit 
Costa Rica and South Africa, where he has been invited to attend 
presidential inauguration ceremonies on May 6 and May 8, 
respectively. 
  Prior to his return to Taipei on May 15, Li will also visit 
Swaziland on May 12, the Foreign Affairs Ministry reported. 
  Li will seek to strengthen and consolidate cooperative ties 
and friendly relationships with the four countries, Presidential 
Spokesman Raymond Tai said. 
  He said the trip is part of the Republic of China [ROC]'s 
strategy to play a more active role in the international 
community -- a policy it is pursuing as payback for the help it 
received from other countries during its own course of 
development.

  [Text] Taipei, May 4 (CNA) -- Governor Samuel Shieh of the 
Central Bank of China said Wednesday [4 May] that he would seek 
the support of Latin American countries for Taiwan's bid to 
become a non-regional member of the Inter-American Development 
Bank (IDB). 
  Shieh made the remark prior to his departure for Managua, 
Nicaragua with President Li Teng-hui, who embarked on a 13-day 
official visit to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa, and 
Swaziland Wednesday morning. 
  To help promote Taiwan's efforts to become an IDB member, 
Shieh said, the Ministry of Finance has earmarked NT [new 
Taiwan] $135 million (US$5.09 million) in its 1995 fiscal year 
budget as a trust fund for the Inter-American Bank. 
  In addition, he pointed out, the Export-Import Bank of the 
Republic of China [ROC] has decided to join with the IDB to 
extend a soft loan of US$50 million to Nicaragua, of which the 
Export- Import Bank will provide US$30 million. 
  Founded in 1959, the IDB boasts 19 members and is the 
world's 
largest regional development bank. The bank, with its 
headquarters in Washington, D.C., offers medium and long-term 
loans to Latin American countries to help boost their economic 
development.

  [Text] Taipei, May 3 (CNA) -- Thirty-seven more Chinese 
medicine shops around the island were found illegally selling 
rhino horn or tiger bone during the second half of April as the 
Council of Agriculture continued its crackdown on the illicit 
trade. 
  Members of the council's special wildlife protection group 
visited 5,623 Chinese medicine shops in 23 cities and counties 
from April 19 through April 30, the council announced on Tuesday 
[3 May]. 
  The task force seized 349.8 grams of rhino horn and rhino 
horn powder in 15 stores and 4,424.7 grams of tiger bone in 22 
stores. 
  "The move is to display Taiwan's sincerity to protect 
endangered species," a task force member said. 
  Disguised as customers, police visited 519 herbal medicine 
shops out of 8,000 on the island in mid-March in Taiwan's first 
nationwide crackdown on the trade. In those raids, 34 stores 
were discovered to be selling tiger bone and rhino horn. 
  According to Article 33 of the revised Wildlife Conservation 
Law, those found guilty of illegally importing, exporting, or 
trading in endangered wildlife or the products gotten from those 
animals can be sentenced to up to five years in jail or a fine 
of up to NT$ [new Taiwan dollars] 1.5 million (US$56,820). 
Repeat offenders could be sentenced to up to seven years or 
fined up to NT$2.5 million. 
  US President Bill Clinton on April 11 issued an order 
prohibiting the import of legally traded wildlife specimens and 
products from Taiwan in retaliation for Taiwan's failure to stem 
the trade in rhino horn and tiger bone. 
  The sanctions will result in an estimated US$20 million to 
US$25 million in annual losses for Taiwan and will limit exports 
of farmed crocodile and snake skins, orchids and coral, local 
trade officials said. 
  The sanctions will take effect on May 11 and will continue 
until December 1994, when the US will review Taiwan's 
conservation efforts and decide whether to extend the import 
prohibition.

  [Text] The top Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong, Lu 
Ping, yesterday broke his silence over his refusal to meet the 
Governor Chris Patten, saying the atmosphere was not good enough 
to facilitate a fruitful exchange. 
  In his first public speech since arriving on Sunday, Mr. Lu 
said China and Britain had to iron out their differences through 
meetings at various levels before the two sat down for talks. 
  Chinese officials had previously suggested Mr. Lu could not 
meet Mr. Patten because the director was too busy. 
  Noting that the Government had barred civil servants from 
contacts with the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), the 
China- appointed working panel for the Special Administrative 
Region, Mr. Lu said the atmosphere remained bad. 
  "The Hong Kong Government has not been very friendly towards 
the PWC," he said. "If the situation is like that, a meeting 
between us will bear no fruit. 
  "Thus, it will be better to start the negotiations at the 
lower level. When discussions at those forums manage to 
progress, then we shall meet to see if we can achieve something 
at this level," said Mr. Lu, director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office. 
  He said the two countries were continuing their discussions 
about the transition of Hong Kong via the Airport Committee and 
the Sino- British Joint Liaison Group (JLG). 
  "I believe that we can reach an airport proposal acceptable 
to both sides soon," Mr. Lu said. "The questions related to the 
financing arrangement and the legislation on the airport 
management authority are both under discussion. I hope there 
will be a quick agreement." 
  Mr. Lu sidestepped a question as to whether his refusal to 
meet Mr. Patten was in breach of the 1991 memorandum of 
understanding on the new airport and related issues. "I came to 
Hong Kong as the deputy director and secretary-general of the 
PWC to participate in the meetings of political and economic 
sub-groups," he said. 
  Under the memorandum, the director and the Governor should 
hold regular meetings. Mr. Lu refused to say when he would meet 
Mr. Patten. "I hope sometime in the future, when there is a 
better atmosphere." 
  PWC member Raymond Wu Wai-yung defended Mr. Lu's decision to 
snub Mr. Patten. He said China had to send a clear signal to 
Britain that Beijing would not bow to pressure. 
  Meanwhile, it was confirmed yesterday that Sino-British 
defence experts would meet again next week to resolve the 
outstanding problems of a draft accord on the disposal of 
military land. The meeting of the JLG would be held from May 10 
to May 13, the Government said. 
  Next week's session is crucial, because a successful outcome 
will facilitate the confirmation of a final agreement in the 
upcoming plenum of the JLG to be held in Hong Kong this month.

  [Text] Lu Ping, China's top official for Hong Kong, will 
meet Heung Yee Kuk representatives tomorrow to discuss the New 
Territories inheritance row. 
  Lu, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, 
will discuss how to introduce Basic Law provisions which 
stipulate protection of the rights and customs of indigenous 
residents in the New Territories, according to sources. His 
meeting will be seen as a gesture of support for the indigenous 
residents locked in a bitter row with the Government over a 
proposal by a legislator, Christine Loh, to give New Territories 
women inheritance rights. 
  It is understood that Lu will discuss internal matters of 
the 
Kuk, the Government's rural advisory body on New Territories' 
affairs. Lu, who last year told members of the Federation of 
Women he supported equal inheritance rights for indigenous 
women, has recently publicly condemned government plans to 
support Loh's amendment. 
  Lu has threatened the New Territories (Land) (Exemption) 
Bill 
would be scrapped in 1997. Yesterday, the vice-chairman of the 
Kuk, Daniel Lam, said he had not yet received confirmation of 
the meeting. Lam said it would be good for the Kuk to have the 
opportunity to meet Lu to put the views of indigenous people. 
  He said if they were to meet Lu, he would want to talk about 
the land exemption bill and the impact of the adoption of the 
United Nations' anti sex-discrimination convention, Cedaw, on 
the indigenous community. The Government is now finalising 
recommendations to the Executive Council on the extension of 
Cedaw to Hong Kong, which are set to affect discriminatory 
practices against New Territories women. A formal announcement 
is expected to be made this month. Women's rights campaigners 
will stage an anti- feudalism rally outside the Kuk offices 
today to protest against objections to grant rural women equal 
rights of inheritance. 
  The protest outside the Kuk headquarters in Kowloon Tong 
will 
be linked to the May 4 movement in China where tens of thousands 
of students marched in Beijing on May 4, 1919 to oppose 
oppressive feudal traditions. Lam said he welcomed the 
opportunity to exchange views with the women's groups and said 
the Kuk supported sexual equality, but said it should not be 
rolled into the inheritance debate.

<F P=106> [Report by Political Editor Danny Gittings and Queenie Wang] </F>
  [Text] When Lu Ping, China's chief of Hong Kong affairs, 
arrives tonight, it will be into a territory that members of his 
immediate family know intimately. Both his wife and son have 
worked for various Hong Kong companies for years, and have easy 
access to the territory's top businessmen and community leaders. 
Their combined knowledge of the territory may give some the 
impression that they are a conduit of information for Mr Lu, who 
has not visited the territory for the past two years because of 
the row over Chris Patten's political reforms. However, a close 
look at the relationship suggests this is unlikely to be the 
case. 
  Mr Lu's wife, Xi Liang, has worked in Hong Kong since 1985, 
while his son, Kenneth Lu Gong, has been employed by a string of 
Hong Kong companies. As China's most senior official on Hong 
Kong affairs, Mr Lu makes it his business to know what is going 
on here -- yet his absence from Hong Kong has made this 
difficult. Neither his wife nor son will be at Hung Hom station 
to greet him when his train arrives from Guangzhou. Some 
suggest the Lu family has grown apart. Others say their absence 
is purely a coincidence. 
  According to colleagues, Ms Xi deputy general manager of 
China International Trade and Investment Corporation (Hong 
Kong), is currently on the mainland on business, believed to be 
using her engineering background to oversee the construction of 
new power plants. Ms Xi, 65, works from a plush office in The 
Landmark, and is not expected back in Hong Kong until the middle 
of the month, according to her secretary. A frequent traveller 
to the mainland, she was also away during her husband's last 
Hong Kong visit, in early 1992. Like many other mainland 
couples of their generation, they work apart and rarely see each 
other, leaving little scope for Hong Kong businessmen to win 
favours from Mr Lu by pampering his wife. 
  The younger Lu has worked for a number of Hong Kong 
companies. He is currently employed by Li Kashing's Cheung Kong. 
Previous employers include the Sino Land property group, headed 
by Robert Ng Chee-siong, and Shell Hong Kong. Mr Lu began 
working for Cheung Kong at the beginning of the year. And 
although he is based in Beijing, his value to Hong Kong 
companies comes through his connections with other influential 
sons of senior Chinese leaders -- the so-called "princelings". 
Besides frequent job changes, the younger Mr Lu has had a 
troubled personal life in recent years. His first wife divorced 
him after she was sent to work in Paris. He remarried last 
year. Those seeking favours from his father's office through 
the younger Mr Lu have little chance of success. "The old man 
would never allow it," said a friend of Mr Lu for 40 years. 
"He's very strict about not using personal connections to win 
favours and gets very angry when anything like that comes up." 
  With so many Hong Kong people wanting to see the elder Mr 
Lu, 
from the Governor down, the absence of his family will probably 
be overlooked. Mr Lu is not the kind of person to let family 
matters mar the important visit. The trip, originally expected 
to last only until Friday, will now continue until April 9. 
Despite the extension, which will give him more time to meet 
people, he will not visit the Governor. A visit by any Chinese 
official to Mr Patten, once dubbed by Mr Lu as a "man of guilt 
for 1,000 years", with the reforms row still unresolved would be 
seen in Beijing as completely impolitic. It would also run into 
opposition from local XINHUA (NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) chief Zhou 
Nan. 
  Forgetting the people Mr Lu will not see in Hong Kong, he is 
still in for a busy time -- and it will not all be pleasant. 
From the moment his train from Guangzhou pulls in at 7 pm, Mr 
Lu and his entourage of 23 aides and mainland Preliminary 
Working Committee members will be the target of protests. 
Operation Save Xi Yang, an umbrella organisation campaigning 
for the release of the jailed MING PAO journalist, is organising 
a major demonstration to mark Mr Lu's arrival. A small radical 
group, Kick Out The PWC, is also planning a protest. Two 
car-loads of Special Branch and XINHUA bodyguards will whisk Mr 
Lu -- and secretary Liu Zhenxin -- past the protesters as he 
leaves Hung Hom for Mr Zhou's villa in Stanley Beach Road, his 
base during the visit. Friends say Mr Lu dislikes the Stanley 
villa, regarding it as too far out of town, although that will 
not deter demonstrators who intend to camp outside while he is 
in residence. Its choice for this visit has already sparked 
speculation of a tacit agreement with Mr Zhou that the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office director will stay out of the spotlight 
this time around. Also accompanying Mr Lu will be top Hong Kong 
affairs officials Wang Fengchao, Xu Ze, and Zhang Liangdong. 
  Mr Lu's first meeting, a gathering of the Preliminary 
Working 
Committee political sub-group, will be held tomorrow in the Bank 
of China Building. This will be followed by a 6 pm ceremony on 
the 17th floor to mark the issuing of the Bank of China's first 
Hong Kong dollar banknotes, at which Mr Lu will rub shoulders 
with minor government officials, such as Monetary Authority 
Chief Executive Joseph Yam Chi-kwong. While these two events 
have been widely presented as the reason for Mr Lu's trip, in 
reality they are little more than a politically convenient 
excuse. During the past year, Mr Lu had made it clear to 
friends that ordinarily he could not return to the territory 
until the political reform row was resolved. 
  The idea of holding PWC sub group meetings in Hong Kong is 
nothing new. Local members, tired of flying to Beijing almost 
every month, have long recommended it as a chance for mainland 
officials to enjoy closer consultation with the local community. 
But the decision to make this week's sub-group meeting the 
first to be held in the territory appears to be politically 
motivated. Although the last session discussed the sensitive 
subject of the civil service, controversially concluding that 
all 180,000 public employees should be asked if they wished to 
remain after the handover, it was nonetheless held in Beijing. 
  "This (the plan to hold the latest meeting in Hong Kong) 
will boost the importance of the Preliminary Working Committee," 
said Professor Lau Siu-kai, an academic and political sub-group 
member. "The symbolic meaning of Mr Lu's visit is more 
important than the subject of the meeting." He said the visit 
showed Beijing had given up all hope of co-operating with 
Britain, and would now concentrate on winning support in the 
local community, a point repeatedly stressed by Chinese leaders 
in recent months. Professor Lau also claimed a meeting with the 
Governor would send out the wrong signals. "Pictures of Mr Lu 
shaking hands with Mr Patten would be misleading to Hong Kong 
people," he said. "This ... might be used by Mr Patten to 
`prove' his strategy is correct; that China's angry reaction to 
his (political) reform proposals is only temporary." 
  The political sub-group meeting which ends on Tuesday, will 
be followed by a session of its economic counterpart. It is not 
yet clear if Mr Lu will attend the meeting, scheduled for 
Wednesday and Thursday. He has skipped several in the past. 
However he will lunch with members on Thursday. Much of his 
remaining time is expected to be spent pursuing the united front 
strategy in meetings with local leftists. Many have already 
been invited to a cocktail reception at the China Resources 
Building in Wan Chai on Tuesday. Some Hong Kong Affairs advisers 
have also requested a separate session with him, and a dinner -- 
with, as yet, unknown guests -- has been arranged for Thursday 
at the Hilton hotel. The Heung Yee Kuk, which is seeking 
support in its battle with the Government over New Territories 
land rights, is also likely to see him. As on previous visits, 
Mr Lu will visit the Kowloon headquarters of the 170,000-strong 
Federation of Trade Unions, China's main grassroots supporter in 
Hong Kong. This is scheduled for next Sunday. 
  But Mr Lu's expected emphasis on meetings with Beijing's 
hard- core supporters, rather than more representative members 
of the community, has already sparked criticism from one local 
leftist. Maverick National People's Congress (NPC) delegate Liu 
Yiu-chu called on the pro-Beijing camp to step back and allow Mr 
Lu time to meet ordinary Hong Kong people. "This time the NPC 
delegates Chinese People's Political Consultation Conference 
delegates and Hong Kong Affairs advisers should not fight for 
meetings with Mr Lu because we already have many opportunities 
and channels to convey our opinions to him," she said. "This 
opportunity should be left to other Hong Kong people." Ms Liu 
said the territory's delegates and advisers numbered only a few 
hundred and could hardly claim to represent Hong Kong's 
population of six million.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with recently released Chinese </F>
dissident Wang Juntao by unidentified reporters for EASTWEEK 
magazine -- owned by the Oriental Press Group, which also owns 
EASTERN EXPRESS -- in New York on 3 May: "`Why Do They Keep on 
Hounding Us?'"] 
  [Text] Just 10 days after his release from a Chinese 
prison for his role in organising the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement, Wang Juntao, one of China's most prominent dissidents, 
remains unrepentant. Five hard years behind bars for a crime he 
has repeatedly denied have taken their toll on his health. His 
serious hepatitis condition shows through his yellowed eyes. 
But his spirit has not been broken. He is chatty, often 
enthusiastic in offering views on various aspects of the Chinese 
government, talks of his time in prison, and more importantly, 
of the love of his life his 30-year-old wife. 
  Coming from a military family, Wang, 35, is nothing short of 
the character expected -- disciplined, patriotic and courageous. 
Throughout the interview, he is forthcoming with his feelings on 
China, but cautious when questions touch upon his comrades. 
  For years while he was in jail, Wang was refused treatment 
for his hepatitis condition. It was only after his wife 
travelled to more than 10 countries, rallying support from 
various heads of state and numerous international democracy 
groups, that Wang was finally released. During the interview, 
Wang repeatedly turned to Hou, looking into her eyes and smiling 
affectionately, grateful for her strong belief in him and her 
efforts to have him released. 
  Wang still calls his wife "little girl", an affectionate 
nickname -- possibly given to her because of her petite size 
when they first met at a party in Wuhan in 1986. To him, Hou is 
still a little girl -- but with a big character and immeasurable 
courage. Because of his little girl's political rallying 
worldwide, the ailing Wang was released on April 23, and arrived 
in the United States after China agreed to allow him to go 
overseas for medical treatment, a face- saving practice often 
used by China to release dissidents when it bows to 
international pressure. 
  Wang, however, denied that he was allowed to go overseas 
purely for medical treatment. It was all a plot to satisfy 
Beijing's selfish interests, he insisted. "I was not allowed to 
go, I was ordered to leave my homeland. That is the real truth. 
  "I remember that morning on April 18 when three senior 
judiciary officers came and told me that I would be allowed to 
go after repeated requests from the US government and after 
careful consideration by the Chinese government. It was decided 
I had better leave for treatment overseas." 
  Wang's first tearful reaction was: "I don't want to leave my 
country." He then pleaded with them to allow him to remain in 
the country, putting him on parole so that he could get medical 
treatment outside the prison. The officials replied: 
"Definitely not. If you do not agree to go to the US you will 
remain in jail with no treatment." He finally agreed. 
  Wang recalled that this was the first time he cried -- he 
just could not bear the thought of leaving his homeland, 
regardless of the difficult situation he was in. Even the 
harshest conditions in prison, and the pain he suffered during 
his 21 hunger strikes could not force him to cry. "I smiled 
every time I went on a hunger strike. I was not sad because I 
knew I was doing the right thing," he said. 
  Wang described himself as a patriotic Chinese, but admitted 
he could never understand the government. "I cannot understand 
why the Chinese government keeps on hounding its people and 
keeps on treating us like enemies. And why are we being chased 
out of the country? 
  "How come every time we are in trouble, we need other 
countries and other people to step in to rescue us?" 
  Wang denounced China for repeatedly using Chinese dissidents 
as political pawns to fulfil its trade interests, and above all 
to win Most Favoured Nation trading status from the US. "This 
practice should be stopped. They should not continue with this 
shamelessly. The Americans are trying to use MFN to help solve 
problems in China, but our government is using it to fulfil its 
MFN dream," he said. "This is equal to selling out the whole of 
the Chinese race. China needs to rethink its policy towards its 
people and should treat us fairly if it still cares about 
national dignity." 
  Surprisingly, Wang refused to blame his ill health on the 
poor prison conditions he lived in and the fact that he was 
denied proper medical treatment for hepatitis. But his prison 
life was undeniably harsh and lonely. "The first cell I was put 
in was less than three square metres. There was a bucket which 
served as my private toilet, and for companionship I had dozens 
of flies buzzing around all day and all night long, along with 
hundreds of insects and various species of worms. It wasn't all 
that solitary a confinement after all," he joked. 
  Wang's mental and physical condition have surprised a great 
many people, including his wife and friends. Many anticipated 
he would be completely broken after six months in prison. Wang 
proved them wrong. But even he admits it was incredible that he 
survived such harsh conditions. He hopes his fellow dissidents 
who are still in prison will be better treated, and he called 
for improved medical treatment for the sick. 
  According to Chinese law, any prisoner who has served one 
third of a jail term can be allowed medical treatment outside 
prison. In Wang's case, his request was repeatedly turned down. 
In the US, Wang is receiving free medical examinations, but he 
has yet to find money for the expensive treatment. Still, he 
insists he does not want financial support from the US 
government. "I don't want to deal with any government at 
all...I want to be independent," he said. 
  Wang admits his decision to leave China was made because he 
did not want to disappoint his wife and others who had worked 
for his release. More importantly, he was concerned that, if he 
turned down the offer of release, he might jeopardise the 
chances of other dissidents. 
  Wang believes there will be a better China in the near 
future 
if democratic movements either inside or outside China are 
better planned. He believes there are three things overseas 
democracy activists can do to improve China's human rights. 
"Firstly, they should do their best to preserve the present 
democratic force in China, which means they have to provide a 
safe back door to prepare for the worst scenario. 
  "Secondly, they have to provide financial support for the 
mainland's democratic movement. Last, but not least, they 
should continue to strengthen international support and keep 
feeding this support back to China." 
  Wang believes China's mainstream democratic movement still 
remains on the mainland, and urges overseas activists not to 
become too removed from China. "Any slight detachment from the 
mainstream movement in China would be equal to pulling the plug 
of the life-support machine that is keeping the dissidents going 
on the mainland." 
  He strongly disagrees with many who believe that China 
should 
be fed the Western recipe of democracy. "That Western style 
would never work in China. We need to formulate something that 
suits the Chinese taste." Wang says a better tomorrow for the 
Chinese, either in or out of China, should begin with a fight 
for dignity. "I want to let the world know we Chinese are not 
cowards. There are many of us on the mainland who are not 
afraid to fight the communist regime or voice a different view." 
  Throughout the best part of the interview, Hou kept silent 
nodding at times to show support and agreement on certain 
issues. Wang's little girl surprised many Chinese officials on 
the mainland during her courageous five years of campaigning for 
his fair treatment and ultimate release. 
  Wang admits that when it comes, to drawing the right 
attention and support, his little girl is streets ahead. He 
first met Hou at his own house party in Wuhan. A colleague 
introduced the two and recommended she join their magazine. 
Wang was not convinced of her ability then, despite praise from 
various quarters. But it was love at first sight, and Wang said 
Hou totally swept him off his feet. The two were married two 
months later in December that year. 
  Wang says he believes in eternal love, at least in his case. 
"The day we were married Xiaotian told me: 'Juntao, if you go to 
heaven I will follow you. If you go to hell, I will follow you, 
and if you get knocked down, I will be the first one to lift you 
up.' 
  "I thought she was bull-shitting me at the time, because 
many 
people do that in Beijing. I was so wrong," he said, reaching 
out to touch her hands. Hou said their strong love kept her 
going during his imprisonment. "There was no communication 
between us at all during those years. We both relied on that 
special feeling linking our souls, which kept us going," she 
said softly. 
  Wang did not realise his wife was the person behind his 
freedom. Only on the day of his release was he told by those who 
had imprisoned him. "I thought it was really strange they all 
told me not to forget the greatness of my wife." 
  Even on the way to the US, when he thanked the accompanying 
US official, the man told him: "You should thank your wife. 
Her sincerity touched every major democracy activist worldwide, 
many heads of state and our president."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "British Parliament's Report Is Out of Step </F>
With the Times"] 
  [Text] From last July to last February, a series of eight 
hearings was held by the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs 
Select Committee. During these hearings, many men of insight -- 
including Cradock -- called for a "stance that Britain must 
abide by the Joint Declaration," and they criticized changes in 
Britain's China policy as "injuring others without benefiting 
oneself." The Foreign Affairs Select Committee, however, turned 
a deaf ear to these criticisms, and on 13 April published a 
report entitled: "Anglo- Chinese Relations Before and After 
1997." Following its publication, the report was widely 
criticized by the media, which said that it "is "out of step 
with the times," "lacks a sense of historical reality," and "is 
irresponsible and erroneous." The Foreign Affairs Committee of 
the China's National People's Congress also sternly rebuked the 
report for flagrantly advocating viewpoints and suggestions 
hostile to China, and expressed its strong indignation at the 
report's wanton interference in China's internal affairs. 
  The British parliamentary report lacked a sense of 
historical 
reality. It could not but admit that the Chinese economy, with 
a vast market, is developing at full speed and thus Britain must 
maintain ties with China, but with the exception of this, all of 
its viewpoints and suggestions were hostile to China's 
flourishing development. Moreover, the report barefacedly 
stated that it was necessary not only to reverse the Joint 
Declaration, but also to repudiate the principles for 
establishing diplomatic relations between China and Britain. It 
called for turning back Britain's China policy to the 19th 
century to try to revive the old historical dream in which the 
great British Empire wantonly interfered in and split up China. 
  The report confessed that "Britain undeniably has changed 
its 
ways." It said: "It should not be taken for granted that the 
Beijing regime will last beyond 1997, so Britain should not draw 
up a rigid China policy." That is to say, even though Britain 
promised in the Joint Declaration to return Hong Kong to China 
and to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability during the 
transition period, the report proposed that the above-mentioned 
China policy "should not be formulated rigidly," which clearly 
laid bare Britain's malicious intention to rack its brains and 
to seize any opportunity to obstruct the implementation of the 
Joint Declaration. 
  The article "Our Basic Stand on the Issue of Hong Kong" and 
its annotations, which were published in the "Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping," showed very clearly that the British side would 
not return Hong Kong to China willingly. The fact that at that 
time, Mrs Thatcher put forward the "thesis of the validity of 
the three unequal treaties" and the "thesis of exchanging 
sovereignty for administrative authority" indicated Britain's 
holy grail of extending its administration over Hong Kong, but 
China warned the British side that if it did not change its 
position, China could not but unilaterally announce its own 
principles and policies for settling the Hong Kong issue. Only 
under this situation did Britain acknowledge that Hong Kong's 
sovereignty and administration should completely revert to 
China, and did Britain sign the Joint Declaration. However, 
Deng Xiaoping foresaw long ago that during the transition 
period, it would be mainly the British that created artificial 
chaos. It showed that the Chinese side was on the alert long 
ago against the likelihood that the British side -- under 
various pretexts and by all kinds of tricks -- definitely would 
attempt to obstruct China's resumption of the exercise of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong. The report imputed the reason for 
the change in Britain's China policy to the "Beijing 
disturbance" in 1989, which was absolutely a sophistry. As a 
matter of fact, this is the natural instinct of the British 
colonialists. International agreements, once signed, should be 
implemented, and no signatory should ever flagrantly interfere 
in the other party's internal affairs and take the latter's 
internal affairs as a pretext for not fulfilling agreements. 
The raging tide of cracking down on separatist activities in 
Northern Ireland and of mass resistance to the poll tax, as well 
as human rights problems, also were seen in Britain, but China 
had never made it a pretext for shirking its responsibility to 
fulfil the Joint Declaration. 
  In her memoirs entitled "The Downing Street Years," Mrs. 
Thatcher wrote that faced with China's solemn position, the 
British side could not but "indicate that we did not anticipate 
there would still be any power linkage between Britain and Hong 
Kong, or that Britain would have any obligation in Hong Kong 
after 1997. However, I felt sorry about that." For those who 
"felt sorry about" the fact that the British side could not but 
sign the Joint Declaration, the "Beijing disturbance" was a 
misfortune over which they gloated, and they harbored the 
illusion of a fluke rather than felt "sorry" about the 
situation, and even did not hesitate to make a reckless move, 
which was precisely a manifestation of colonialists unwilling to 
retreat from the historical scene. The report attacked Articles 
18 and 58 of the Basic Law, barefacedly opposed the fact that 
China has sovereignty over Hong Kong, urged the European Union 
to draw up anti-China policies, extended support to Patten's 
unilateral action in his "three violations" political reform 
package, and even flagrantly called for meddling in the Tibet 
and Taiwan issues. All these attacks are a resurgence of the 
die-hard nature of colonialism throughout history. 
  The report made various viewpoints and suggestions that 
were hostile to China, demonstrating that some people in Britain 
still try to employ tricks and to handle Sino-British relations 
with the gestures of a past century. The extent of the 
deficiency in their sense of historical reality and their 
inability to keep up with the times is amazing. The report 
said: "From the Opium War on, China has been forced to adapt to 
a new order of the international community backed by the 
international law, and this process is yet to be completed." 
This remark really hit the nail on the head and fully exposed 
Britain's motive in changing its China policy, that is, it wants 
to revert to the historical stage, from the Opium War to the 
years before 1949, when Britain plundered and split up China. 
The new China, however, rejected the so-called "order" imposed 
by Britain and other powers from the West. Hence, those 
die-hard colonialists in Britain yearn for the likelihood that 
the Chinese people's regime "may not last beyond 1997" and that 
the "process" of extending British rule over Hong Kong will be 
"completed!" 
  However, as China grows rich, strong, and prosperous, it is 
fully capable of resuming its exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong on schedule. Moreover, Britain and other countries from 
the West will never be allowed to interfere in China's internal 
affairs or to split up its territory. While it has become a 
historical trend for every country in the world to develop its 
cherished relations with China, the British parliamentary report 
attempted to organize an international anti-China coalition to 
contain China, split it up, and obstruct it from resuming 
sovereignty over Hong Kong. However, all these moves indicated 
that they merely overrated their abilities. History will prove 
that the British parliamentary report merely noted down the 
dishonorable trouble-making scheme worked out by British 
colonialists when they were withdrawing from Hong Kong, whereas 
such a scheme is doomed to fail.

  [Text] Helsinki, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Finnish President 
Martti Ahtisaari today met Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC). 
  Both leaders expressed satisfaction over Sino-Finnish ties 
and said they are ready to further promote the all-round 
development of the political, economic and trade relations 
between China and Finland. 
  Li said his visit is the first of its kind by China's CPPCC 
chairman to Europe and the purpose is to deepen mutual 
understanding, expand exchanges and enhance cooperation. 
  The Chinese leader is currently on an official goodwill 
visit 
to five European countries -- Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark 
and Belgium. 
  China and Finland are far off in distance but enjoy close 
links, Li said, adding that both countries have tremendous 
potentials for mutual cooperation. 
  On his part, President Ahtisaari said Finland and China have 
been enjoying sound relations, which have not been affected by 
changing international situation. 
  He stressed that finland is fully understanding the Chinese 
Government's efforts to define its policy according to China's 
own historic and practical conditions. 
  In a meeting with Finnish Parliament Speaker Riitta 
Uosukainen, Li said that China, which is deepening reform and 
accelerating its opening to the outside world, can learn a lot 
from Finland especially in advanced technology and management 
expertise. 
  Uosukainen said the Finnish Government attached great 
importance to its relations with China, to China's viewpoints 
and the will of the Chinese people. 
  While Finland needs to strengthen its ties with the European 
Union, she said, it is even more willing to enhance its 
friendship and cooperation with China.

  [Text] Beijing, May 4 (AFP)--China on Wednesday dismissed 
President Bill Clinton's warning that it risked losing its 
most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status with the United States 
if further improvements are not made in human rights. 
Commenting on Clinton's warning, issued Tuesday, a foreign 
ministry spokesman suggested that the United States had just as 
much to lose as China if MFN is not renewed in June and he 
reiterated Beijing's opposition to the linkage of MFN with human 
rights. 
  "The Chinese government has repeatedly and clearly stated 
that the mutual offer of MFN status between the United States 
and China is a reciprocal and mutually beneficial arrangement," 
the spokesman said. "MFN status should not be linked to other 
issues irrelevant to it. This position remains unchanged," he 
added. 
  Clinton said Tuesday that while he had no wish to withdraw 
China's MFN, Beijing had yet to make the "significant progress" 
demanded by his executive order in some areas of human rights. 
Asked if China's MFN status was in serious jeopardy, the 
president replied. "Yes, it is a possibility." 
  Clinton must make a decision on MFN renewal by June 3. 
  The MFN issue has dominated Sino-U.S. relations for the past 
year, and ties have been further strained by bitter disputes 
over textile quotas, U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, and alleged 
Chinese sales of missile technology to Pakistan. 
  At the same time, however, economic and trade ties have 
strengthened considerably, with the American business community, 
which is firmly opposed to the withdrawal of China's MFN, 
investing heavily in what is now the fastest growing economy in 
the world. 
  MFN status entitles imports to be brought into the United 
States at low or zero customs rates. In China's case, the status 
is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
  The U.S. trade deficit with China soared 25 percent last 
year 
to a record 22.8 billion dollars, an independent U.S. agency, 
the International Trade Commission (ITC), said Tuesday. 
  The deficit has risen steadily in the past three years, from 
12.6 billion dollars in 1991 to 18.2 billion in 1992 and 22.8 
billion in 1993, the ITC said.

  [Text] China's economic czar Zhu Rongji, whose political 
fortunes will be jeopardised by hyperinflation, has threatened 
to axe local officials in an expanding move to check market 
prices. Chinese sources said the executive vice-premier ordered 
regional officials to be personally accountable for price 
control. 
  Failure to rein in the runaway inflation will weaken the 
political position of Mr. Zhu, who is betting his political fate 
on dealing with the boom-bust economy, analysts say. 
  At a recent emergency national telecommunication conference, 
Mr. Zhu warned provincial party chiefs and government heads to 
spare no effort to combat inflation, saying they were gambling 
with their future. "The inflation rate should be contained to 
below 12 per cent in the second quarter of the year, and under 
no circumstance is it allowed to rise to 15 per cent in that 
period," he was quoted as saying. 
  In the first quarter of the year, China reported an 
inflation 
rate of 20 per cent. 
  Mr. Zhu, who was acting premier at the conference, warned 
that if inflation was not immediately checked in the first half 
of the year, the national goal to rein in annual inflation at 
under 10 per cent would fail. The government has set a 9 per 
cent growth rate while containing inflation at 10 per cent in a 
bid to cool down the overheating economy. 
  "I would step down if the economic problems cannot be 
solved," Mr. Zhu said recently. 
  Chinese economists and analysts said the political future of 
the fast-rising star was tied with his ability to deal with the 
boom-bust economy. 
  "Inflation should fall to around 10 per cent this year and 6 
per cent next year," Mr. Zhu said in March. 
  To bring the annual rate below 10 per cent, the Chinese 
government must keep the combined figure of the coming three 
quarters at a quarterly percentage of not more than 6.67 per 
cent. 
  Chinese economic sources said Mr. Zhu blamed the runaway 
inflation on local officials who were scrambling for more 
investment in an apparent defiance of Beijing's repeated 
warnings. In an unprecedented move "to kill one to warn a 
hundred", Mr. Zhu last month fired a provincial party chief for 
failing to toe Beijing's line on economics. 
  In his six-day tour to the northeastern province of 
Heilongjiang two weeks ago, Mr. Zhu announced a central order to 
strip Sun Weiben, the party secretary of the provincial 
Communist Party committee and head of local legislature, of all 
official positions. 
  In the meeting, Mr. Zhu said regional top officials should 
give the price control top priority in their agenda. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Zhu has called for stricter control of grain 
prices and urged the booming coastal regions not to neglect 
agriculture, according to press reports. 
  In a speech carried on the front page of major Chinese 
newspapers, he observed that rationalisation of grain prices was 
essential to the establishment of a stable grain purchasing and 
selling mechanism.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Chun (0491 6511): "Li Lanqing </F>
Inspects Zhuhai, Says Zone Should Plan To Open Border Crossing 
for 24-Hour Traffic"] 
  [Text] Zhuhai, 2 May (WEN WEI PO)--While inspecting Zhuhai 
City, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and vice premier, stressed that the special economic zone 
[SEZ] should be "different" from the rest of the country, adding 
that the zone should bring changes to traditional modes of 
thinking, throw convention to the wind, and carry out 
experiments so as to set an example for the hinterland. The 
plan to open the border crossing for 24-hour traffic tabled by 
the Zhuhai government should be put into effect. Consideration 
should be given to the government's plan to set up a bonded 
area. It is necessary to adopt advanced and scientific 
management techniques from abroad, but gambling and vice must be 
forbidden, he said. 
  Accompanied by Guangdong Vice Governor Liu Weiming, Li and 
his entourage arrived in Zhuhai on 30 April. 
  While commenting on whether the SEZ should be "different" 
from the rest of the country and on ways to become unique, Li 
pointed out: The SEZ's should be "unique" and their uniqueness 
should manifest itself in setting an example to others. It is 
essential to explore ways to revitalize state-owned enterprises. 
The SEZ's should bring changes to traditional modes of thinking 
and carry out bold and useful experiments in setting up a 
socialist market economy so that they can provide successful 
experiences to the interior. It is necessary to adopt advanced 
and scientific management techniques from abroad. However, 
gambling and the practice of "offering female attendants to 
customers to accompany them in drinking, dancing, and singing in 
entertainment establishments" must be forbidden. 
  Li said that a plan for customs to provide round-the-clock 
service put forward by the Zhuhai government is a good one. The 
plan should be brought into effect. The Zhuhai government plans 
to set up a bonded area. I believe the plan warrants 
consideration, but the government must act in line with 
international practices and standards, he said.

  [Text] Nanjing, 2 May (XINHUA) -- While conducting thorough 
investigations and research into military units in northern 
Jiangsu from 22 April to 2 May, Zhang Zhen, Central Military 
Commission [CMC] vice chairman, urged the broad masses of 
commanders and soldiers to carry forward and promote our army's 
fine traditions during the new historic era; to always nurture 
the distinctive character of the people's army; to resolutely 
take the road of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; to adhere to CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin's 
"five-point" general requirements; and to further revolutionize, 
modernize, and regularize the army to make new contributions to 
safeguarding the national defense and socialist system. 
  While visiting the site of the New Fourth Army headquarters 
and the New Fourth Army Memorial Hall in Yancheng on the 
afternoon of 22 April, Zhang Zhen said with deep feeling: The 
New Fourth Army fought here in the War of Resistance Against 
Japan for eight years. The troops had very inferior weapons and 
few bullets. What did they rely on to attain victory? They 
relied on the party Central Committee's correct leadership and 
Chairman Mao Zedong's brilliant command, on the masses of 
people's effective support, and on the army's fine revolutionary 
traditions. At the end of his visit, Zhang Zhen respectfully 
copied a Marshal Chen Yi poem: "How many old fighters of those 
years are alive now? Millions upon millions of mighty new 
soldiers are a consolation to those loyal souls." The copy was 
presented to the New Fourth Army Memorial Hall. He also visited 
the Bancheng Martyrs' Mausoleum, which was old site of the New 
Fourth Army headquarters, and paid his respects to officers and 
men of the New Fourth Army who were killed in action during the 
War of Resistance Against Japan. 
  On his way to investigate and study various localities, 
Zhang 
Zhen referred to his own personal fighting experiences and 
described the old Red Army's traditions. He said: Our army was 
established personally by revolutionaries of the older 
generation, including Mao Zedong; weathered tests, including the 
25,000-li Long March, the War of Resistance Against Japan, 
China's War of Liberation, and the War To Resist U.S. Aggression 
and Aid Korea; and has many fine traditions. The fine 
traditions include: the party's absolute leadership over the 
army; the aim to wholeheartedly serve the people; effective 
ideological and political work; the three main rules of 
discipline and the eight points for attention [san da ji lu ba 
xiang zhu yi 0005 1129 4764 1774 0360 7309 3137 1942]; 
political, economic, and military democracy at the company 
level; and unity between the military and government and between 
the military and the people. Revolutionary martyrs paid with 
their blood as the price for these fine traditions that are our 
army's valuable spiritual treasure. He encouraged the officers 
and men to cherish historic honor and promote fine traditions. 
  Zhang Zhen emphatically pointed out: We should carry forward 
and develop the traditions. First, we should understand what 
our army's traditions are. Every division, regiment, and 
company has its own glorious history. We should very properly 
screen and summarize them respectively and carry them forward. 
Proceeding with this understanding, we should also integrate 
traditions with actual conditions in an effort to facilitate new 
development in old traditions and add new contents to the 
traditions under changed circumstances. 
  At a Red Army regiment and a military unit where the late 
Wang Jie was attached when alive, Zhang Zhen held conversations 
with grass-roots officers and men on ways to continually promote 
fine traditions. He said: While conducting army building in 
the new historic era, we have encountered many new circumstances 
and issues. To resolve them, we should, on the one hand, arm the 
minds of officers and men with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and his thought 
on army building in the new period. This is a basic 
requirement. On the other hand, we should also carry forward 
and promote our army's fine traditions. He urged cadres at 
various levels to set an example in every aspect, to take the 
lead in promoting the fine traditions, and to pass on the 
cherished heritage of the people's army from generation to 
generation. 
  Zhang Zhen urged the broad masses of commanders and soldiers 
to particularly uphold the distinctive political character of 
waging hard struggles under the new circumstances at present. 
He pointed out: Although the economy has developed and living 
standards have been improved, we cannot discard the tradition of 
waging hard struggles. Building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics requires that several generations of people 
arduously perform pioneering work. Even after China has become 
strong and the people have become rich, we will still need the 
work style of continually waging hard struggles. 
  During his tour in north Jiangsu, Zhang Zhen also conducted 
thorough investigations and research in units including military 
schools and academies, logistics departments, and military 
subdistricts. He also made a special trip to Huaian to pay 
respects to and visit Comrade Zhou Enlai's old residence and 
memorial hall.

<F P=106> [Anhui Government Work Report delivered by Anhui Governor Fu </F>
Xishou at the Second Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial 
People's Congress on 6 April] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: 
  On behalf of the provincial people's government, I now 
submit 
the government work report for your examination and approval as 
well as for suggestions and comments from the provincial members 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and 
other comrades attending the meeting as observers. 
<H5>  I. A Review of the Work for 1993 </H5>
  Over the past year, inspired by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
important remarks, guided by the guidelines set forth at the 
14th CPC National Congress, and led by the Anhui provincial CPC 
committee, people of all nationalities throughout the province 
emancipated the minds, rose in unity with force and spirit, 
resolutely carried out indepth reform, and achieved great 
progress in economic construction, new development in various 
social undertakings, further enhancement in building a socialist 
spiritual civilization, and a gratifying phase of thriving 
development in the province. 
1993 Marked the Fastest Growth and Best Development of the 
National Economy Since Carrying Out the Policy of Reform and 
Opening UpThe total output value of gross domestic products 
reached 94 billion yuan, up 22 percent over the previous year. 
The gross output value of agriculture was 41.7 billion, an 
increase of 8.5 percent. Total grain output was 25.96 million 
tonnes, representing an increase of 10.8 percent; output of 
other agricultural products also showed varying degrees of 
growth. The total output value of village and township 
enterprises topped 110 billion yuan, obtaining new heights. The 
gross output value of industry was 140.02 billion yuan, an 
increase of 44.6 percent and an improvement of economic 
benefits. Industrial output value at village level or higher 
was 94.9 billion yuan, an increase of 26 percent, propelling our 
province's ranking in the nation from 14 to 12. Energy and raw 
material production showed steady growth. The output of high 
value-added products increased by a large volume. Revenue 
topped 7.32 billion yuan, up 32.8 percent, achieving a balance 
in revenue and expenditures. Commodity supplies were abundant. 
The overall retail amount of social products grew by 15.9 
percent. New progress was made in basic construction and 
technological transformation. The building of a 2,500-cubic 
meter blast furnace at the Maanshan Steel Plant was completed; 
the Hefei-Jiujiang Railway was extended to Anqing; the roadbed 
project for Hefei-Tongling Highway was completed; 
under-the-bridge structural work along the Tongling section of 
the Changjiang Bridge was completed; the entire Pihe-Huaihe 
Waterway was open to navigation; the 200,000 kwh [kilowatt hour] 
generating set at the Huaibei Power Plant and the two 125,000 
kwh generating sets at the Wuhu Power Plant began supplying 
electricity; and expansion projects at Xinji, Number Two 
Liuqiao, and Xinzhuang Coal Mines were completed. We realized 
the goal of installing program-controlled telephone exchanges 
and digitalized long-distance communications equipment, and of 
establishing mobile telephone networks in cities. New progress 
was made in irrigation works on the Huaihe, Honghe, and Xinhe. 
Reform and Opening Up Made Greater StridesThe process 
of building a market economy in rural areas was accelerated. 
The household contract responsibility system which links 
remuneration with output was steadily promoted and improved. 
Enterprise reform was carried out in earnest, with over 70 
percent of state-owned enterprises conducting 
intra-entrepreneurial reform in three areas. Maanshan Steel 
Plant, Anhui Energy Company, and Meilin Enterprise transformed 
their management systems, successfully listed their stocks on 
the stock market, obtained 7.236 billion yuan in construction 
funds, and conducted beneficial exploration for building a 
modern enterprise system. Further expansion of the private 
economy provided one more sector of economic growth in our 
province. The pace to increase the building of a social 
security system was accelerated. Reform of the public-funded 
medical care system and housing reform were promoted 
step-by-step. Development of a commodity market and a market 
for major means of production showed excellent momentum. We 
steadily promoted commodity price reform, with the ratio of 
commodity prices that were decided by the market being raised 
over 90 percent. We opened ourselves up wider to the outside 
world. The overall export amount increased by 16 percent. We 
delegated import-export rights to localities. We approved the 
establishment of 1,040 Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative 
enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises. A total of 
$370 million in foreign funds was utilized, up 1.6-fold from the 
previous year. Construction increased at the Hefei New and High 
Technology Development Zone as well as the Wuhu Economic and 
Technology Development Zone. Port construction was increased. 
We continued to develop international tourism. In order to 
promote friendly relations, we sent a provincial government 
delegation to visit Maryland in the United States. 
  New progress was made in social undertakings. Our 
scientific and technological advances were further applied in 
economic development. We tackled 85 major scientific and 
technological problems, achieved success in 645 provincial-level 
scientific and technological projects, developed 1,977 new 
products, and achieved remarkable results in popularizing the 
application of technologies. Scientific and technological 
undertakings run by local people developed rapidly, and the 
technology market became more and more brisk. New achievements 
were made in educational reform and development. Further 
development was made in making elementary education compulsory 
and universal; developments were also made in secondary 
vocational and technical education. The illiteracy rate among 
young people decreased by 2.9 percent. Higher education was 
further restructured. Non-governmental sectors became a new 
force for running schools in both urban and rural areas. The 
cultural, art, radio, cinema, television, press, publication, 
and social science fronts actively conducted academic research 
and art creation, and produced a number of highly commended good 
works on such important occasions as the publication of the 
third volume of "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the 
commemoration of Mao Zedong's birthday centennial. Our 
population growth rate decreased to 17.18 per thousand, the 
first time it was below the nation's average. Rural public 
health work was strengthened, and urban medical care service 
further improved. The province won 11 gold medals during the 
seventh national games, its competitive sports maintained a 
rising trend, and its mass sports activities continued to 
develop. New achievements were made in auditing, statistics, 
archives, nationalities affairs, religious affairs, and 
recording local history. 
  The people's standard of living further improved. The 
average amount of per-capita income that urban residents used 
for living expenses was 2,026 yuan, up 403 yuan, while the 
per-capita net income of peasants was 724.5 yuan, up 151 yuan; 
after adjustment for price changes, the incomes increased by 9.1 
and 9.4 percent respectively. Nearly 1 million people in poor 
regions solved their problem of basic needs in food and 
clothing. With accelerated housing construction in both urban 
and rural areas, the average floor space occupied by each urban 
resident was 7 square meters, and the average floor space 
occupied by each rural resident was 10 square meters. With the 
people of various nationalities concentrating their energies on 
economic construction, the political situation of stability and 
unity was further consolidated. Leading cadres performed their 
duties honestly and exercised self- discipline. Initial success 
was achieved in investigating and handling important cases and 
correcting unhealthy tendencies. The government further 
improved its legislative work and accomplished its annual plans 
for drafting and enacting local administrative rules and 
regulations. The province continued comprehensive efforts to 
improve public order, and achieved positive results in waging 
special struggles against "railroad and highway bandits." 
  Fellow deputies: Last year was one in which we persisted in 
reform and opening up and kept forging ahead. The practice 
during the year has further confirmed our confidence in 
developing a socialist market economy. At the same time, it has 
also enriched our experience. To sum up, we have gained the 
following experience: 
  -- We must persistently regard the emancipation of the mind 
and the deepening of reform as tasks of prime importance. We 
should guide the cadres and people, particularly cadres in 
economic departments, in order to foster new ideas of a 
socialist market economy, free themselves from the ideological 
fetters of traditional planned economy, and overcome 
difficulties and solve problems by deepening reform. It is 
necessary to keep forging ahead, enhance the awareness of 
competition, and overcome the passive attitude of inertia. We 
should unify our thinking in seizing opportunity and 
accelerating development. The emancipation of the mind and the 
renewal of ideas were transformed into a powerful motive force 
which propelled last year's reform and construction. They will 
also certainly yield a far-reaching impact on our future 
development. 
  -- We must persist in making rapid progress as well as 
carefully organize and exercise macroeconomic regulation and 
control. Since we studied and implemented Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's important talks made during his southern China 
inspection tour, the province has developed its economy in an 
all around way and enjoyed good momentum in economic 
development. How to make efforts to keep the momentum for a 
comparatively longer period is the key to the further 
development of Anhui's economy. We have always adhered to the 
basic guidance that "development is the last word"; we have 
never wavered in the face of difficulties and problems. Since 
the beginning of last year, we have increased the survey of 
economic trends and promptly adopted measures to solve such 
problems as the slowing down of industrial growth and fund 
shortages. Since the central authorities published 
macroeconomic regulations and control measures, we have 
unswervingly implemented them. At the same time, we do not 
demand uniformity, and we have considered our own realities and 
avoided sharp fluctuations. As a result, we have achieved a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of our economy. 
  --We Consistently Regarded Agricultural and Rural 
Work as the Primary TaskWe concentrated our efforts on 
reducing the peasants' burden, making payments for the purchase 
of agricultural products, implementing the preferential policy 
on grain and cotton production, and building up grass-roots 
organizations, thereby preserving and rallying the peasants' 
enthusiasm for production. Considering that work on readjusting 
the agricultural structure was carried out rather slowly in some 
localities, we launched agricultural systems projects and 
developed good-quality, high-yield, and highly-efficient 
agriculture in these localities. Regarding rural reform, we 
established five policies designed to quicken the pace of market 
economic development in rural areas and to encourage peasants to 
enter the market. These measures played an important role in 
developing the rural economy in an all-round manner and in 
increasing peasant incomes by a large margin. 
  --We Made Persistent Efforts To Do More Things To 
Benefit the People and Endeavored To Improve Our Work 
StyleWe defined the work objectives of the current 
provincial government, organized and mobilized people across the 
province to achieve the 12 major objectives aimed at enabling 
Anhui to move up to a new level in five years, concentrated our 
efforts on properly carrying out 50 practical jobs to bring 
about major development to Anhui within three years, and signed 
responsibility contracts with units responsible for carrying out 
this work. In general, all work was carried out effectively. 
  In reviewing last year's work, we should fully affirm the 
achievements we have made, and yet soberly realize that problems 
remain to be solved. They are: adjustment of the economic 
structure has been carried out too slowly; the economic 
efficiency of some enterprises, especially medium and small 
enterprises, is poor; more enterprises have been operating at a 
loss; agriculture's relative efficiency is poor; the gap between 
industrial and agricultural products has widened; peasant 
incomes are low; some localities have withheld teachers' wages; 
price increases have been relatively high; workers in some 
money-losing enterprises and the masses of poor have had 
difficulty making ends meet; public security is poor in some 
localities; and corruption still exists among a small number of 
government workers. Although we have taken some measures to 
deal with these problems, we need to work harder to 
fundamentally wipe them out. 
  Deputies, 
  Although Anhui's economy has begun to develop rapidly, we 
are 
still in a developing status. To invigorate Anhui's economy is 
an extremely arduous task. 
  Anhui's economy will continue to develop in 1994, which is 
an 
important year for Anhui in advancing reform. Therefore, it is 
extremely important to do this year's work effectively. The 
central authorities have emphatically pointed out that seizing 
the current opportunity to deepen reform, to broaden the scope 
of opening up, to quicken development, and to maintain stability 
is the general work guideline of the entire party and country, 
and work in all spheres should conform to and meet this 
guideline. Taking Anhui's reality into consideration, we should 
creatively carry out our work; properly handle the relationship 
between reform, development, and maintaining stability; and 
uncover and cope with in a timely manner new situations and 
problems pertaining to development so as to win new victories in 
Anhui's reform and construction. 
  II. Strive To Maintain Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy 
Economic Development 
  The basic tasks in Anhui's economic work for this year are: 
to comprehensively implement the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the 10th 
enlarged plenary session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial CPC 
Committee; to increase the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure; to open up wider to the outside world; to 
strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control; to 
optimize the economic structure; to increase economic returns; 
to control inflation; and to maintain rapid economic growth. 
The growth rate of the total output value of goods and services 
is set at 13-15 percent; of the output value of industries at 
and above township level is 20 percent; of total agricultural 
output value is 4 percent; and of sales of consumer goods is 20 
percent. The investment in fixed assets is planned at 35 
billion yuan, up 21 percent, and revenue is targeted at 8.5 
billion yuan. The annual rate of increase in prices of consumer 
goods should be maintained under the average national level. 
The abovementioned objectives are positive and attainable 
through efforts. In the meantime, we should be aware of the 
arduousness of the task despite the good trend of rapid growth 
over the past two years. In the course of development, on the 
one hand all localities should uphold the principle of rapid 
development as soon as possible, and on the other avoid blind 
competition with each other. They should achieve sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development by relying on solid and 
meticulous work. 
Comprehensively Develop the Rural Economy and Strive To 
Increase the Peasants' IncomeAnhui is a major agricultural 
province, and agriculture is a traditional industry of the 
province as well as the most important aspect of its economy. 
Agricultural and rural work must be placed above all other 
tasks at all times. Under the current circumstances, doing an 
effective job in agricultural and rural work has decisive 
importance to properly handling relations between reform, 
development, and stability. This year, we should further deepen 
rural reform, stabilize the party's basic policy in rural areas, 
conscientiously enforce the "Law on Agriculture," and continue 
to implement the strategy of "achieving one steady growth and 
stepping up two developments." Having maintained a steady 
growth of grain, cotton, and edible oil, we should increase the 
readjustment of the agricultural structure, improve agricultural 
efficiency, and strive for greater increases in the peasants' 
income. 
  A sound land contracting system is the key to maintaining a 
steady rural policy. The central authorities have made new 
provisions in this regard. These new provisions stipulate that 
when contracts expire, they can be extended for 30 years without 
any changes being made to the document. During the contracting 
period, the central authorities recommend that we utilize a 
method which allows us to "increase manpower without increasing 
land acreage, and reduce manpower without decreasing land 
acreage," thus permitting us to lawfully transfer land-use 
rights and be compensated for the transfer. Our province, which 
takes into consideration its actual situations, stipulates that 
during the contracting period, land-use rights can be leased, 
collateralized, or used for shareholding. It also stipulates 
that contracts for the use of barren hills, wastelands, deserted 
shoals, and unutilized water can be extended to between 50 to 70 
years. Relevant provincial departments should draw up measures 
to decontrol land-use rights. Efforts to improve the land 
contracting system involve a large number of households and are 
strongly policy oriented. All localities should proceed from 
reality and work enthusiastically in a sure and steady manner. 
The adoption of policies facilitates a rational distribution of 
basic production factors in rural areas, the management of land 
on a suitably large scale, and the transfer of surplus rural 
labor to other sectors. These policies will give impetus to the 
development of rural economies for a long time. 
  In the 1990's, we have predominantly switched from seeking 
quantitative increases to stressing both better and higher 
yields as well as high efficiency in agriculture. This marks a 
great turning point in agricultural development. We should make 
corresponding changes in work-related guidance in order to 
adjust ourselves to the change. We should make arrangements to 
implement systematic agricultural projects; to promote 
operations which combine trade, industry, and agriculture into 
one; to promote development of industrialized, regionalized, and 
serialized products; and to promote development of highly 
efficient and high-value-added industries as well as agriculture 
which reaps foreign exchange. We should focus on developing 
such serialized products as good quality rice, cotton, 
oil-bearing crops, tea leaves, domestic animals, poultry, 
pongee, fruits, vegetables, marine products, Chinese medicinal 
materials, Chinese chestnuts, and edible mushrooms; we should 
also turn vast numbers of such products into commodities. In 
practice, we should highlight regional features and provide 
guidance accordingly. Beginning this year, the state will be 
selecting and providing key support to 500 commodity 
grain-producing counties, 150 counties which produce 
high-quality cotton, and a group of zones which showcase highly 
efficient forms of agriculture that provide greater and better 
yields. Our province is hopeful that 41 of its grain and 
cotton-producing counties, and one of its exemplary zones, will 
be selected; all localities should earnestly see to it that we 
succeed. The province will select and implement a "project to 
showcase comprehensive agricultural development" in 10 key 
counties, 20 bases of certain scale, and 50 administrative 
villages; the province will promote "a highly efficient form of 
agriculture that provides greater and better yields." We should 
continue to expand the Huang Hai-Huai Hai comprehensive 
agricultural development project and the Huaibei agricultural 
irrigation project. Enterprises involved in farm reclamation 
have skilled personnel, technologies, and facilities as their 
assets; they should play the lead role in developing a 
market-oriented agriculture. We should continue to focus on the 
"fifth eight-year" afforestation and greening plan. This is the 
last year for us to develop barren hills, so we must complete 
our tasks. We should also pay attention to solving the problems 
facing mountain regions and should develop those regions' 
economies. 
  We should increase the input into agriculture through 
various channels. Beginning this year, we must see to it that 
the increase in the input into agriculture is higher than the 
growth rate of regular fiscal revenues, and that banks allocate 
at least 10 percent of their new loans for agriculture. We 
should continue to implement the strategy of invigorating 
agriculture with science and technology, stabilizing the 
contingent of scientific and technical personnel in rural areas, 
popularizing fine seeds and practical techniques, and further 
mechanizing farm work, thereby bringing into play the role of 
science and technology in agricultural development. In the 
course of developing a market-oriented agriculture, farmers will 
make more urgent demands for socialized services. Therefore, we 
should expedite the establishment of a sound socialized service 
network at the county, township, and village levels which can be 
run either by the government or by the masses, and which focuses 
on providing services in circulation, science and education, and 
information. 
  On the condition of raising quality and efficiency, we 
should 
promote the development of village and township enterprises. We 
should unswervingly carry out the "1235" [numerals as published] 
project, increase assistance to the six counties along the Huai 
He, and pay close attention to helping backward areas begin to 
move forward. The present scale of village and township 
enterprises in Anhui is rather small. We should accelerate the 
pace of optimizing their organizational structure and build 
their strength while introducing the new tax system. In 
evaluating the performance of village and township enterprises 
this year, the focus should be shifted from output value to 
sales volume in order to prompt enterprises to more 
expeditiously optimize structure and improve efficiency. We 
should actively develop the economy at the village level and 
build up the economic strength of collectives. The partnership 
system in the form of stock sharing is a mode of managing assets 
which can help clearly define property rights, change operating 
mechanisms, and formulate effective accumulation. This system, 
which is quite popular in society and very suitable for village 
and township enterprises, should be supported and developed. The 
development of village and township enterprises should be 
organically combined with the construction of small rural towns. 
Meanwhile, we should reform the household registration system in 
small rural towns to promote rational mobility of rural labor, 
and strive to bring about a major change in the outlook of 
Anhui's rural areas. 
  To help backward areas shake off poverty and become well off 
is an arduous task confronting us today. Based on the state's 
aid-to-the-poor plan, Anhui has drawn up a program to assist the 
poor. Under the program, we shall help 3 million impoverished 
people solve the problem of food and clothing in three years, 
cast off poverty in five years, and lead a well-off life in 
eight years. It is necessary to implement various policy 
measures, improve the management of aid-to-the-poor projects, 
raise the efficiency of using funds earmarked for assisting the 
poor, lay equal emphasis on assistance and development, develop 
pillar industries, and build up the stamina of backward areas 
for self-development. All local governments and departments 
concerned should do everything within their capacity to help 
poor areas become well off as soon as possible. 
  Governments at all levels should effectively strengthen 
leadership over rural work, and on the basis of consolidating 
the achievements already made, continue to pay keen attention to 
implementing the various rural policies of the party and 
government. They should work relentlessly to reduce burdens on 
peasants. Fees explicitly abolished by the central and 
provincial authorities must be discontinued so as to protect and 
harness the enthusiasm of peasants at large and to quicken the 
pace of advancing towards moderate prosperity. 
  It Is Necessary To Improve the Industrial Structure 
and Increase Economic EfficiencyWe should vigorously 
support pillar industries, develop high quality products with 
added value, increase economic efficiency, and promptly create a 
favorable situation for economic development. In the 
development of the machinery industry, we should lay stress on 
developing the manufacturing of automobiles and engineering 
machinery. We should pay attention to the production of 
automobile, forklift, hydraulic excavators, and digital 
controlled lathes. In the development of the steel industry, we 
should attach importance to developing the Maanshan Iron and 
Steel Company as well as to renovating the Hefei Steel Mill and 
other medium and small iron and steel enterprises. In the 
development of the nonferrous industry, we should increase the 
economic scale, support mining operations, and do an effective 
job in multipurpose use of materials. In the development of the 
building materials industry, we should give prominence to 
developing large cement plants and should expand the production 
of new building materials. In the development of the chemical 
industry, we should pay attention to stabilizing the production 
of items for supporting agriculture. Meanwhile, we should 
accelerate the reorganization and renovation of enterprises, and 
vigorously develop the production of high quality products. In 
the development of light industry, we should quicken the 
adjustment of production structures, develop name brands and 
high quality products, keep up with market demands, actively 
develop new products, and constantly increase the market share. 
In the production of household electrical appliances, we should 
give full play to the advantageous position of backbone 
enterprises such as Meiling, Yangzhi, and Rongshida and the 
Jianghuai Air conditioner plant, developing the serial products 
of those enterprises. In the development of the electronics 
industry, we should consolidate the output of television sets 
and develop audio-video equipment, magnetic materials, and other 
advantageous products. We should also accelerate the 
development of electronic information engineering. In the 
development of the medical industry, we should pay attention to 
developing the production of Chinese traditional remedies, 
health food, medical apparatus, and other materials for medical 
use. In the development of the tobacco industry, we should 
control total output and increase the proportion of high and 
medium grade cigarettes. Presently the textile industry is 
faced with many difficulties, and we must take full advantage of 
state support, lay stress on intensive processing, and strive to 
create a new situation. All trades and professions should 
adjust their production structures by following the needs of the 
market and the principle of "increasing the production of easily 
marketable goods, limiting the production of items in average 
demand, and stopping the production of overstocked items." In 
this year, the entire province should develop 1,850 new products 
and begin production of over 70 percent of those new items. 
  Importing high technology and technological transformations 
is an effective way to improve production structures and raise 
economic efficiency. We should speed up technological 
transformation of various enterprises. We should carry out 
technological transformation for 40 percent of large and medium 
sized enterprises and 30 percent of state-owned enterprises. 
This year, we will invest a total of 11.2 billion yuan for 
technological transformation, of which 8 billion yuan will be 
invested in state- owned enterprises. In addition, we will 
import technologies worth $350 million. We should attach 
importance to major technological transformation projects at the 
state, province, and county levels. The province will organize 
113 enterprises to carry out 119 technological transformation 
projects to "achieve high quality, develop news product and 
quicken production," and change them into large-scale backbone 
enterprises with sales volumes exceeding 100 million yuan and 
profits and taxes exceeding 10 million yuan each. We should 
continue to implement the "production research" project, and 
strive to have Rongshida, Meiling, and other large and medium 
sized enterprises as well as digital control and laser 
technology projects included in the state scientific and 
technological development program. We should do an effective 
job in conserving energy. We should reduce the consumption of 
coal per 10,000 yuan of output to under 2.7 tonnes, or reduce 
the rate of energy consumption by 3.5 percent. The 
establishment of a technological transformation fund is an 
effective measure to promote the technological transformation of 
various enterprises. The provincial government has decided to 
increase appropriation for the technological transformation fund 
on the basis of the starting amount of 20 million yuan last 
year. According to their respective financial situation, 
various locales should appropriately establish special funds and 
increase their investment in technological transformation. 
  We should properly organize production in industry and 
communications; take emphatic charge of converging production 
with sales in the fields of energy, raw material, 
communications, and transportation as well as of coordinating 
the use of current capital from enterprises; pay close attention 
to market situations; promptly solve new problems arising in 
production; and ensure the normal functioning of communications 
and industrial production. Enterprise management should be 
strengthened. Enterprises should conscientiously strengthen 
internal management; properly conduct personnel training; 
enforce technological, labor, and financial discipline; and 
implement a responsibility system for cost management throughout 
the entire production and operation process. They should 
strengthen production safety and eliminate all kinds of 
potential hazards. It is necessary for them to earnestly 
implement the Product Quality Law, improve technical 
supervision, and carry out proper quality control. We are to 
take serious charge of the work to make up deficits and increase 
surpluses in enterprises, as well as comprehensively analyze and 
classify enterprises which are running at a loss and give them 
separate guidance. We will help enterprises make up deficits 
and increase surpluses through such effective measures as 
establishing development funds for eliminating losses. Being 
the subject of eliminated losses, enterprises should further 
implement an internal target responsibility system for 
eliminating losses and continually upgrade economic efficiency. 
It Is Necessary To Further Invigorate Distribution and 
Stabilize Commodity Prices on the MarketAccording to this 
year's market forecast, there will be a basic balance between 
supply and demand for industrial goods for daily use, and a 
slightly tight supply of a small number of agricultural and 
sideline products as well as capital goods. State-owned 
cooperative commercial enterprises should play an effective role 
in supplying daily necessities and major agricultural capital 
goods, and in making arrangements for materials needed for key 
production and construction projects. They should pay close 
attention to the procurement of grain, cotton, and oil to ensure 
the state has in hand an adequate supply of goods and has a 
strengthened ability of regulation and control. They should 
work hard to open up urban and rural markets, actively unfold 
activities to promote sales, widen the field of consumption, and 
satisfy consumption needs at different levels. Privately and 
individually-owned commerce is a weak link in the province's 
distribution sector that calls for vigorous development. The 
peasants' income increased substantially last year, providing 
favorable conditions for invigorating the rural market. 
Distribution enterprises should take various measures to promote 
the two-way flow of industrial and agricultural products. 
  Since the market is the medium of distribution, the demand 
on 
market building grows as the economy develops. We devoted 
efforts to market building in recent years, forming a number of 
specialty wholesale markets such as Haozhou's Chinese medicines, 
Yingshang's Nanzhao rice, Wuwei's Liudu timber, and Fanchang's 
Eqiao tea, as well as a number of large general shopping malls 
such as the Hefei Department Store. We also devoted efforts to 
rapidly developing various capital goods markets and playing an 
important role in invigorating distribution. We should continue 
to accelerate market building, emphatically establish a number 
of large and medium wholesale markets and large shopping malls, 
and vigorously develop various capital goods markets in order to 
gradually form a distribution network that integrates large, 
medium, and small, general and specialty, wholesale and retail, 
as well as urban and rural markets. We should accelerate the 
development of markets as regards production factors such as 
personnel, labor, capital, technology, and information; we 
should also establish various intermediary organizations for the 
market. We will continue to smooth distribution channels, 
improve market rules, strengthen market management, and sternly 
crack down on the production and sale of fake and shoddy goods. 
  The price index was relatively high at the beginning of 
this year, so it is rather difficult to achieve price control. 
Governments at various levels must pay close attention to this 
and take various measures to maintain relative price stability. 
It is necessary to vigorously establish or improve the system 
for stockpiling important commodities such as grain, cooking 
oil, and meat as well as to establish a price-regulating fund 
for non-staple food. The grain stockpiling system has been 
instituted for two years; this year we should ensure the amount 
of grain is stockpiled as planned. Now we should establish a 
risk fund for grain production. We should continue to implement 
the system of full responsibility for mayors and effectively 
carry out the "vegetable basket" project by protecting and 
expanding the acreage sown to vegetables and stabilizing the 
prices of non-staple foods in towns and cities. Efforts should 
be made to strengthen control over the prices of commodities 
that are deregulated, and to particularly strengthen the 
monitoring and inspection of the prices of 20 necessities and 
services needed by residents in daily life. The prices of all 
commodities and services should be clearly marked, and 
supervision and inspection of such prices should be 
strengthened. The price index of consumer goods should be 
strictly controlled. As we are striding forward in reform and 
as prices are rising rather sharply, we should pay close 
attention to the livelihoods of people living in 
poverty-stricken areas, retired people, and enterprise workers 
facing great difficulties, and we should help them solve 
problems. 
We Should Strengthen the Building of Infrastructural 
Facilities To Increase Our Staying Power of Economic 
DevelopmentWe should continue to do a good job in building 
collieries in Huainan and Huaibei whose coal is for unified 
distribution, as well as coal mines in Renlou, Xinji, and other 
places. Every effort should be made to have the province's coal 
output reach 11 million tonnes, and to build the Wuhu Power 
Plant's fourth-stage extension projects and the Huaibei No. 2 
Power Plant. We should accelerate the coordinated construction 
of power grids and make efforts to solve the problem of power 
supply for 2 million people in remote and poor areas. In 
railway construction, we should complete the track-laying task 
for the Anhui section of the Hefei-Jiujiang Railway; increase 
construction of the Fuyang and Hefei railway hubs and the Qinglu 
Railway; and actively make preparations for the construction of 
a bridge over Chang Jiang at Wuhu, the Tongjiu Railway, and the 
Hefei- Luan section of the Ningxi Railway. In highway 
construction, we should efficiently build such key projects as 
the Hefei-Wuhu, Hefei-Tongling, and Dunxi-Huangshan roads; the 
Dalong section of the Hefei-Ningguo; and the highway bridge over 
Chang Jiang at Tongling. We should increase the construction of 
infrastructural facilities and public works in urban areas. We 
should make efforts to build postal and telephone service 
networks in urban and rural areas, and to double the 
telephone-exchange capacities in those areas. 
  We should persistently increase the building of water 
conservancy projects, especially the new Huaihong He project, 
flood control projects along Chang Jiang and Huai He, and the 
supportive projects in the Pi-Shi-Hang irrigation area. We 
should begin harnessing Baokuai He, increase the rebuilding of 
dangerous reservoirs, and vigorously build capital construction 
on farmland. We should effectively strengthen the management of 
projects, perform our work in flood control and drought 
fighting, and increase our ability to overcome natural 
disasters. Enough funds should be raised for water conservancy 
projects, and they should be put to good use. We should 
continue to implement systems and measures that have been proved 
effective, such as rural labor accumulation [nong cun lao dong 
ji lei gong 6593 2625 0525 0520 4480 4797 1562] and the 
irrigation project construction month. 
  At no time should we slacken our efforts at environmental 
protection and land management. We should continue to stress 
the prevention and treatment of pollution in Huai He and Chao 
Hu, and should treat the major sources of pollution within a set 
time. We should make preparations for treating the polluted 
water in Chao Hu by using a loan from the Asian Bank, and try to 
start the actual treatment as soon as possible. We should 
further strengthen land management and check up on spontaneous 
land transactions, as well as develop and standardize the land 
market. We should implement a fundamental system for farmland 
protection, speed up the development and utilization of reserve 
land resources for farming, and strive to maintain a balance 
between the increase and decrease in farmland. 
  We Should Expand Sources of Funds and Increase 
Investments. Last year, Anhui's investments in fixed 
assets grew by 34.9 percent, which was still below the national 
average and the investments of the peripheral regions. The fixed 
asset projects planned for this year require us to put in more 
funds, to do everything possible to expand sources of capital, 
to increase the total amount of investment, and to optimize 
investment patterns. We should, first of all, try to list more 
projects under the state plan on loans; second, we should 
utilize foreign capital in various forms to make up the shortage 
of funds; third, we should build up our capability to raise 
funds through issuing shares and bonds; fourth, we should 
improve the management of construction funds and conserve 
capital; and fifth, we should diversify investment sources and 
encourage collectives and individuals to invest in public 
welfare undertakings. 
  Fellow deputies, I would like to call special attention to 
the issue of macroeconomic regulation and control. As we are in 
transition from a planned economy to a socialist market economy, 
strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control 
is of particular importance. The success of macroeconomic 
regulation and control last year has once again testified that 
the deeper reform goes and the faster the economy develops, the 
more necessary it is to exercise effective macroeconomic 
regulation and control over economic activities. From now on, 
the provincial people's government will attach greater 
importance to the work in this field; will comprehensively apply 
planning, fiscal, taxation, and other regulatory means; and will 
bring into play the role of auditing, supervisory, statistical, 
and industry and commerce administrative departments to step up 
economic coordination in day-to-day work and to ensure normal 
operation of the national economy. 
III.Press Ahead With Overall Reform, Achieve Breakthroughs 
in Key Areas, Accelerate the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure 
  The convening of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee was a hallmark that China's economic 
structural reform entered a new stage of pressing ahead with 
overall reform. The focuses of reform for this year are: 
continuing to change the operating mechanisms of state-owned 
enterprises; actively exploring effective ways for establishing 
a modern enterprise system; expediting the reform of fiscal and 
taxation, banking, investment, and foreign trade systems; and 
establishing a macroeconomic regulation and control system in 
keeping with the demand of a market economy. We should comply 
with the central authorities' unified arrangements in pressing 
Anhui's economic structural reform ahead and striving to achieve 
breakthroughs in reform to promote economic development. 
We Should Accelerate the Pace of Changing the Operating 
Mechanisms of Enterprises, and Should Actively Explore Ways To 
Establish a Modern Enterprise System.Since reform was 
extended from the countryside to cities, enterprise reform has 
always been the core of economic structural reform. This year 
we should start with tackling some deep-seated contradictions. 
The centerpiece of enterprise reform should be shifted from the 
policy readjustment stage of delegating more powers to 
enterprises and allowing them to retain a portion of their 
profits, to a new stage of instituting a new enterprise system 
focused on the clear definition of relations of property rights. 
The establishment of the modern enterprise system is a 
pioneering undertaking. We should explore effective ways for 
setting up such system by trying it out at selected points and 
summarizing the resultant experiences. Two or three enterprises 
in Anhui will experiment with the state pilot project, while 50 
more will try out the provincial pilot project. In addition, 
Bengbu City has been tasked with experimenting with the national 
project for "optimizing capital structure and strengthening 
enterprise vitality;" and Tongling and Xuanzhou cities, with the 
national projects on comprehensive city and county reform, 
respectively. All local governments and departments concerned 
should earnestly implement the pilot projects and strive to 
obtain tangible results as soon as possible. 
  We will push forward reform of the system covering 
enterprises' property rights. We will allow more state-owned 
enterprises to be operated by civilians, publicly owned 
enterprises to be operated by private investors, encourage the 
leasing of these enterprises to be managed by private investors, 
and gradually standardize such enterprises according to the 
requirements of a modern enterprise system. We will accelerate 
the establishment of markets for the trading of property rights 
and encourage enterprises to merge or form associations. We 
will promote the readjustment of the organizational structure of 
enterprises by vigorously developing enterprise groups linked by 
property rights. To reform small state-owned enterprises, we 
will adopt a flexible method combining leasing and contracting, 
including selling such enterprises. Losing enterprises unable 
to save themselves and unable to pay debts should be allowed to 
declare bankruptcy. When the assets of enterprises are to be 
transferred, they must be carefully appraised in order to 
prevent the loss of state property. 
  The system of shareholding is a new system suitable for 
Anhui's economic development and is also an integral part of the 
effort to establish a modern enterprise system. We should 
continue to conduct experiments in the shareholding system and 
strive to have 20 percent of the large-and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises, about 100 enterprises, change to a 
shareholding system within this year. Those enterprises which 
have changed to a shareholding system should observe rules and 
truly operate in accordance with the new system. Maanshan Iron 
and Steel Company, Anhui Energy Company, and Meiling Company, 
whose stocks have been listed, should accelerate changing their 
operating mechanisms so as to provide new experiences for the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system. 
  Establishing a modern enterprise system is a new process. At 
present, we should continue to implement the "Enterprise Law" 
and the "Regulations on Transforming the Operating Mechanisms of 
Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People" and clearly 
define the rights and responsibilities of enterprises. We 
should conscientiously implement state regulations and policies 
on the supervision of state property, draw up implementation 
rules for our province, and thoroughly reappraise the stocks and 
assets of enterprises. Enterprises within the budget, whose 
second-round of contracts has already expired, should, beginning 
this year, switch to a unified tax system in accordance with the 
requirements for reform of the state financial and taxation 
systems. Local tax reductions and exemptions for enterprises 
which were approved by the provincial government prior to 30 
June 1993 but which have not yet expired must be reported to the 
Ministry of Finance and the State General Administration of 
Taxation for reexamination and confirmation. Beginning in 1994, 
we will adopt the method of taxing these enterprises first and 
then reimbursing them later. 
Strive To Improve Financial Work by Earnestly Undertaking 
the Reform of the Financial and Taxation Systems.Reform of 
the financial and taxation system is the central link of several 
major reforms this year. For this reform there will be a 
transitional period. At the beginning, we will implement the 
dual-track system, with the old and new systems operating 
simultaneously. This is because it is hard to get rid of all 
the problems left over from the old system. Our interests might 
be harmed if we fail to keep up with our work. Therefore, in 
doing our financial work this year, we must combine reform with 
development in order to ensure a steady increase in revenues and 
taxes. 
  The following principles will be adopted by the provincial 
government for the reform of the financial and taxation systems 
of prefectures and cities: with the actual income in 1993 as the 
base figure, the revenues of various localities will be ensured; 
under the premise that the income of localities will not be 
affected, the provincial finance department will take 
appropriate measures to centralize financial resources in order 
to strengthen its ability to exercise macroeconomic regulation 
and control. Through reform, we will gradually standardize the 
distribution of financial resources among governments at all 
levels, eliminate the distribution of financial resources at 
will, and enhance the initiative of governments in managing 
their finances. We will rely on our own efforts to achieve a 
balance in receipts and expenditures. 
  As Anhui's expenditures this year will be increased 
considerably, we must exercise stricter control over revenues 
and strive for a specified increase in both central and local 
tax collections to ensure a balanced budget for the year. Our 
important tasks are currently as follows: First, we should 
adjust our ways of thinking so that more revenue sources will be 
identified in line with central policies and in consideration of 
local realities. Second, we should tighten tax imposition and 
collection management, insist in full collection for all 
mandated central and local revenues, and take effective measures 
to rectify the practice of "unaccounted revenue circulation," 
and strictly enforce the new tax system by freezing all 
unauthorized new tax deductions and exemptions. Third, we 
should rationally arrange and strictly control expenditures by 
adhering to the key principle of setting aside funds to 
guarantee workers' wages and the unavoidable administrative and 
case investigations expenses. We should reform ways of sharing 
budgeted funds by popularizing zero-based budgeting methods. 
Strict control over administrative institutions' group 
spending power should be continued and the scope and eligibility 
for fund appropriations should be conscientiously screened and 
rectified. Fourth, we should straighten out financial work, 
enhance the quality of financial and taxation personnel, improve 
approving procedures and systems, tighten financial budgets, and 
establish a strict investment and return management system. 
Fifth, we should separately set up central and local taxation 
offices according to the State Council's uniform arrangements. 
Successfully promoting reform of the financial system and 
improving financial work.Taking into consideration Anhui's 
reality, cadres and staff and workers within the financial 
circle should help reform the financial system so that a 
uniform, open financial market with orderly competition and 
strict control can be gradually established. 
  We should fully bring out the main functions of state-owned 
specialized banks, strive to increase total credit funds, and 
work harder to meet the targets of a 10.3-billion-yuan increase 
in bank deposits and a marginal increase of extended credits 
reaching the average national level. Banks should provide good 
service in settling accounts, reducing funds in transit, and 
accelerating cash flow. Guided by the industrial policy, we 
should optimize the credit structure and pursue a sound lending 
policy by adhering to the principle of "supporting the good one 
and restricting the bad one." We should guarantee funds needed 
for the construction of key projects, appropriately solve the 
problem of extending loans to medium- and small-sized 
enterprises to be used as circulating funds, be positive in 
supporting loss-making enterprises with good chances for 
recovery and capabilities of repaying loans, and mobilize more 
funds for production purposes by enlivening deposited funds and 
maintaining an appropriate fund reserve ratio. 
  Perfecting Anhui's local financial system is an important 
task to be carried out. We should actively create conditions to 
facilitate the Communications Bank carrying out business in 
Anhui as soon as possible and set up urban and rural cooperative 
banks on a trial basis, with a view to turning them into 
financial organizations primarily serving the local economy and 
the medium- and small-sized enterprises. We should guide the 
healthy development of the rural cooperative funds that serve as 
genuine mutual-help financial institutions in the neighborhoods, 
aggressively seek state approval to make both Hefei and Wuhu 
open cities financially, develop various types of non-banking 
financial organizations, and regulate stock issuance and 
listings to promote the development of a security market. 
  It is necessary to deepen the reform of the investment 
system and strengthen the investment risk prevention mechanism. 
In this regard, we should do a good job in four respects: 1. 
We should formulate the reform plan of this province in 
accordance with the basic orientation and principle of the 
reform of the investment system. We should rationally divide 
the administrative responsibility, powers, and rights among 
provincial, prefectural, city, and county governments. We 
should establish the provincial-level investment system and 
capital-raising system step by step, keep improving them, and 
encourage investment from various investors. We should organize 
personnel to screen existing investment channels, and formulate 
policies which will help widen investment channels and improve 
the mode of capital flow. 2. We should step up the recovery of 
loans extended, in lieu of state appropriation, by the 
provincial government over the previous years. We should make 
construction funds circulate faster and raise the efficiency of 
investment. 3. We should establish and improve the investment 
information system, step up the collection and analysis of 
investment information, and provide effective service to 
investors. 4. We should implement a corporate project 
responsibility system. From now on, a principal responsible 
person must be clearly identified before the start of any 
construction project, so as to strengthen the investment risk 
prevention mechanism. 
  It is necessary to accelerate the reforms of social security 
and the housing system. With the deepening of enterprise and 
other reforms, it is imperative for us to establish a sound 
social security system. We should set up a unified social 
security management organ in accordance with the principle of 
"unified management and separation of administration from 
business," and accelerate the establishment of a multi-level 
social security system. We should pay attention to improving 
the retirement pension system and the unemployment insurance 
system for enterprise workers. We should combine organizational 
funding with individual payments so that both the organization 
and the individual share the burden of pension funding and 
medical insurance premiums for urban workers and staff members. 
A further step should be taken to improve the unemployment 
insurance system, with the premium paid by enterprises according 
to a fixed percentage of the total wages of its workers and 
staff members. We should universally establish a job-related 
injury insurance system for enterprise workers and staff 
members. By summing up the experience of the experiments 
conducted at select rural spots on guaranteed pensions, we 
should practice a system of voluntary individual retirement 
accounts among peasants in rural areas with the necessary 
conditions. 
  We should promote the reform of the medical care system. The 
provincial government has already issued procedures for 
reforming and improving the administration of free medical care. 
All levels should formulate as soon as possible detailed rules 
for implementation and operate according to the new procedures. 
At present, we should pay attention to solving the problem of 
waste in free medical care and curb excessive increases in 
medical expenditures. 
  We should accelerate the reform of the housing system. We 
should establish a public accumulation fund system, actively 
promote rent reform, promote the sale of public-owned houses, 
and speed up the commercialization of housing. In housing 
sales, we should adopt various forms of property rights. In 
rent reform, we should pay attention to ensuring a reasonable 
ratio between rents and house values. The public accumulation 
fund should be managed by an intermediary organ established by 
the government. All localities should firmly strengthen 
leadership and strictly implement policies to ensure sound 
reform of the housing system. 
IV. Open Wider to the Outside 
  In last two years, this province achieved fairly notable 
progress in opening up. We should open up wider in more fields, 
maintain a steady growth of exports, make better use of foreign 
capital, promote economic exchanges and cooperation with foreign 
countries, and make new progress in the development of an 
export-oriented economy. 
  The state will take a further step in reforming the foreign 
trade management system. The reforms of the banking, finance, 
and taxation systems concern foreign trade work. These reforms 
will create a more relaxed external environment for foreign 
trade. At the same time, they will push foreign trade 
enterprises onto a track of fair competition. Foreign trade 
enterprises should accelerate the change of operational 
mechanisms. The companies which have been authorized to 
practice the shareholding system should operate according to the 
new operational mechanisms. Foreign enterprises which have the 
necessary conditions should develop themselves toward forming 
enterprise groups. We should continue to improve the internal 
management of foreign trade enterprises, promote the reform of 
the personnel system and the distribution system, and enlarge 
the scope of the hiring system and the contract system. 
  It is necessary to give priority to earning foreign 
exchange through exports in order to develop an open economy. 
The export mix should be readjusted according to the changes of 
the market. Efforts should be made to open international 
markets and to expand our foreign trade. We should continue to 
implement the market-diversification strategy, with product 
quality as a top concern; consolidate and develop the 
multichannel export network; and strive to maintain the steady 
growth of foreign exchange earned through exports while 
attaching importance to economic efficiency. This year the 
province plans to earn $1.1 billion in foreign exchange through 
exports, an increase of 15 percent over last year. 
Provincial-level foreign-trade companies, which are the main 
foreign-exchange earners, should continue to make the best of 
their favorable conditions to expand their export volume. 
Prefectural- and city-level foreign-trade companies should also 
work hard to increase their exports. The province now has 41 
production enterprises which are licensed to export products 
themselves, and they are a new force in earning foreign exchange 
through exports. They should pay attention to their credit and 
strive to open up channels for exports and to maintain a 
long-term share of the international market. Relevant 
departments should simplify procedures for exporting products by 
the three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned 
enterprises, improve their services for such enterprises, and 
give them vigorous support. Banks should do everything possible 
to help raise needed funds in earning foreign exchange through 
exports. Foreign-trade enterprises should participate in 
developing products, guide companies in developing products with 
competitiveness and prospects for export, and encourage the 
export of complete sets of equipment, machinery, and electrical 
products. While consolidating and developing markets in 
developed countries, we should further open up markets in 
developing and new countries in order to diversify markets and 
reduce market risks. As for the economic and trade 
organizations we have set up outside the country, the 
departments in charge and comprehensive management departments 
should strengthen their supervision and control over such 
organizations to make them really play a role in expanding our 
foreign trade and economic relations with other countries. 
  We should make better use of foreign capital by readjusting 
the structure of foreign-capital utilization and expanding the 
fields in which such capital is used. The three kinds of 
partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises have developed 
rapidly in the province; among them, however, there are not too 
many infrastructure projects, large production projects, or 
projects that are capable of yielding high value added or 
earning foreign exchange through exports. Counterpart funds 
provided by the Chinese side are inadequate, and the rate of 
such projects going into operation and their economic efficiency 
are not ideal. Various localities should conscientiously sum up 
their experiences, strengthen their macroeconomic guidance, and 
improve their work efficiency and the investment environment to 
promote the better and faster development of partially or wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises. In giving guidance in industrial 
policy, it is essential to encourage foreign businessmen to 
invest in projects in transportation, energy, raw and 
semifinished materials, foreign-exchange-earning agriculture, 
and high value-added products. It is now an urgent task to make 
a success of existing partially or wholly foreign-owned 
enterprises. There is a lot of work to do in managing such 
enterprises because they are scattered in vast areas, and the 
relationship of the jurisdiction over them is complicated. 
Relevant departments in various parts of the province should 
improve their services, protect investors' legitimate rights and 
interests according to the law, and help such enterprises solve 
concrete problems arising in their operations. We should 
gradually improve the management of the three kinds of partially 
or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. We should make better use 
of loans from foreign governments, international financial 
institutions, and international commercial banks; use such loans 
for appropriate projects, optimize the structure of foreign 
debts, and increase our ability to repay such debts. 
  We should strengthen our overall planning and leadership in 
opening to the outside world. Hefei and Wuhu cities should give 
full play to their role as forerunners in opening to the outside 
world, make full and flexible use of preferential policies 
granted by the state, and vigorously develop an open economy so 
as to promote economic development in their surrounding areas. 
The Hefei New- and High-Technology Development Zone should 
maintain its momentum of speedy development, and the Wuhu 
Economic and Technological Development Zone should concentrate 
on completing its projects under construction, having them go 
into operation as soon as possible, and turning out products to 
their capacity. The 11 development zones approved by the 
provincial government should complete the construction of their 
elementary infrastructure facilities and have their overall 
plans appraised and approved. Management organizations and 
enterprises in such development zones should employ a new 
management system and new operating mechanisms according to the 
requirements of the market economy. Other cities along the 
Chang Jiang, key cities serving as railway hubs, and cities 
along highways should make full use of their convenient 
transportation facilities to increase their strength and improve 
their conditions in opening wider to the outside world. 
Customs, port, and commodity inspection departments should 
serve better the purpose of opening up. 
  It is necessary to quicken the development of an 
international tourist industry centered on Huang Shan. We 
should develop central, eastern, western, and northern tourist 
regions to establish a tourist trade that corresponds with that 
of southern Anhui. Localities with rich tourist resources 
should incorporate the tourist industry into the national 
economic and social development plan. We should further utilize 
foreign funds to develop tourism and invite foreign investors to 
participate in comprehensive tourism development projects. We 
should make vigorous preparations to expand the Tunxi Airport 
and renovate roads leading to important scenic spots. We must 
vigorously develop tourist merchandise so as to increase foreign 
exchange earnings from the tourist trade. We should strengthen 
the management of the tourist industry and strive to improve the 
quality of our service. We should organize well major events of 
tourist attractions such as Huang Shan tourism and Jiuhua Shan 
temple festivals. 
  It is necessary to further develop friendly overseas 
contacts 
as well as fully exploit the role of provinces, regions, and 
friendly cities as economic and trade partners. We should 
actively establish exchanges and cooperation in the scientific 
and technological, educational, cultural, health, and sports 
fields with them. Foreign and Taiwan affairs departments should 
strengthen their contacts overseas as well as with Hong Kong, 
Macao, and Taiwan to enhance mutual understanding, make Anhui 
more well known abroad, and establish a new image. 
V. Effectively Restructure Government Institutions; 
Promote the State Public Service System 
  Institutional restructuring is an important condition for 
establishing the socialist market economic system and promoting 
economic development as well as an urgent task for the 
restructuring of the political system. Anhui will implement 
institutional restructuring in accordance with the central 
authorities' unified plan. In institutional restructuring, it 
is necessary to abide by the principle of changing functions; 
regulating relations among government departments; streamlining 
administrative functions; and upgrading efficiency, as well as 
implement such restructuring measures gradually, progressively, 
and steadily from top to bottom. First, plans for 
provincial-level institutional restructuring have been approved 
by the party Central Committee and State Council, and are being 
implemented. The task will be basically completed in the first 
half of this year. Second, prefectural- and city-level 
institutional restructuring will begin in a suitable time in the 
first half of this year, to be completed within the year. 
Third, county- and village (township)-level institutional 
restructuring will be fully implemented in the fourth quarter of 
this year, and we will try to complete the task in the first 
half of next year. While proceeding with government 
institutional restructuring, it is necessary to vigorously 
promote reform in enterprise units in accordance with the 
principle of separating government and enterprise functions. 
  Institutional restructuring is a complex project, and full 
preparations and a meticulous job are required. We must base 
our task on the demand for developing the socialist market 
economic system and on actual conditions, as well as firmly 
focus on the key task of changing functions to find various 
specific restructuring methods. The institutional restructuring 
is obviously a transitional task. The provincial government 
will give localities certain self-governing rights and 
flexibility in establishing institutions. Apart from some 
essential ones, the establishment of suitable local institutions 
will be decided by localities themselves. The government will 
not insist that localities exactly follow government 
institutions. Of course, in practice, it is also necessary to 
maintain a continuation of top-to-bottom relations and ensure a 
smooth transition and succession of work. It is necessary to 
consider the overall task, implement strict discipline, and 
realistically do a good job in personnel distribution. 
Principal departments of various trades must not interfere with 
local institutional establishments and personnel placement. All 
localities and departments must avoid initiating unauthorized 
upgrading of the level of institutions, break rules to promote 
cadres, or take advantage of occasions to distribute money and 
materials. 
  We will accomplish the task in institutional restructuring 
this year and implement the state public service system 
gradually according to plans. Meanwhile, reform of the wage 
system will be correspondingly implemented for institutions and 
enterprise units. Effective implementation of these reform 
measures is significant to strengthening a clean government, 
upgrading personnel quality, and increasing the efficiency of 
government administration. All localities and departments must, 
in accordance with the unified plans of the central and 
provincial authorities, strengthen leadership as well as 
strictly and meticulously enforce policies to ensure smooth 
progress of the three reform measures. 
  While promoting institutional restructuring and implementing 
the state public service system, it is necessary to improve 
institutions' work style. Government offices and personnel at 
all levels must always firmly uphold the fundamental aim of 
serving the people wholeheartedly, establish a sense of public 
service, work through the grass-roots level and masses, forge 
close relations between cadres and the people, curb bureaucracy 
and formalism, speak the truth, and do practical work. We must 
strengthen discipline and ensure the smooth enforcement of 
administrative orders so that every policy is implemented to the 
letter. Provincial government organs should strive to do a good 
job in improving their work style. 
  VI. Accelerate the Development of Social 
Undertakings by Taking Economic Construction as the Central Task 
  Science and technology is a primary production force and is 
the forerunner of and decisive factor for economic development. 
We will make further efforts to reform the science and 
technology management system and to create a better environment 
for scientific and technological development and for science and 
technology to serve economic construction in a better way. 
Adhering to the principle of "holding fast to one end and 
leaving the whole field open," we will continue to support 
research in basic sciences, strengthen research in applied 
sciences and in new and high technology, and encourage 
developmental- and application-oriented scientific research 
institutions to integrate science and technology with the 
economy by establishing science and technology enterprises or by 
directly joining enterprise groups. Judging from Anhui's actual 
conditions, the development and application of science and 
technology should focus on solving urgent problems, such as 
developing high-efficiency agriculture giving high yields, 
technical transformation of enterprises, application of new and 
high technologies in industrial enterprises, and the 
assimilation of imported advanced technologies. We will increase 
investment in science and technology and establish, as soon as 
possible, a provincial fund for the popularization of scientific 
and technological achievements and a risk fund for the 
development of new and high technologies. We will make vigorous 
efforts to cultivate technology and information markets, train 
more scientific and technological personnel, and strengthen the 
intermediate links responsible for putting scientific and 
technological achievements to use in production. Enterprises 
should enhance their ability to absorb and assimilate scientific 
and technological achievements and accelerate their technical 
transformation and progress. Nongovernmental scientific 
research institutions which have emerged in recent years now 
constitute a new force. There are 1,200 such institutions in 
the province, all of which are demonstrating strong vitality. 
We should encourage them to grow by adhering to the principle 
of "support, guidance, service, and management." We will pay 
attention to scientific and technological work at grassroots 
units, strengthen guidance over, and provide better service for 
their work. We plan to convene a provincial science and 
technology conference and organize an exhibition trade fair on 
scientific and technological achievements. All areas and 
departments should earnestly make preparations for this event. 
  Modernization depends on the training of professional 
personnel and the enhancement of the educational level of the 
citizens. We should conscientiously implement the "Outline of 
Educational Reform and Development in China," give priority to 
the strategic task of developing education, and increase 
investment in education. We will strengthen basic education and 
make the nine-year compulsory education system universal in 19 
new counties (cities, districts) this year, with the aim of 
reducing the illiteracy rate among the middle-aged and young 
people to 11.3 percent. We will actively develop vocational and 
technical schools and adult education by establishing 100 
county-level demonstration vocational senior middle schools in 
stages. We will raise the educational level of government 
functionaries by promoting education and in-service training. 
Schools of higher learning should reform their educational 
system, readjust the curriculum structure, strengthen internal 
management, and improve teaching quality. We will concentrate 
on improving Anhui University. All departments directly under 
the provincial government should strive to create a condition 
for Anhui University to take part in the "211 project" of the 
state. The provincial government will allocate 10 million yuan 
in special funds for Anhui University each year for the next 
five years, starting with 1993. At the same time, the 
provincial government will support Hefei Industry University and 
other universities and colleges to join the "211 project." We 
will eliminate the old practice in which education was 
monopolized by the government, gradually establish a new system 
in which the government plays the central role in running 
schools, and all walks of life pool their efforts to expand 
education. The government will play the central role in 
developing basic education, and trades, enterprises, 
institutions, and all sectors of society will gradually play the 
leading role in running vocational and adult schools. We will 
mobilize all walks of life to continue carrying out the "hope 
project." We will encourage and support civilians to run 
various types of schools. Under the premise of insisting on 
conditions for running schools, we will relax policies on 
running schools and simplify the examination and approval 
procedures. We will conscientiously implement the "Law on 
Teachers," promote the custom of respecting teachers and 
knowledge, protect the legitimate rights and interests of 
teachers, strengthen the training of teachers for civilian-run 
schools and raise their educational level, and strive to build a 
contingent of teachers who have high moral integrity and are 
professionally proficient. To solve the problem of the failure 
to pay teachers on schedule, the provincial government has 
ordered the departments concerned to draw up relevant measures 
in line with state provisions to ensure that teachers are paid 
in full on schedule. 
  We will make further efforts to promote a good custom of 
respecting knowledge and professionally trained people and will 
strive to create an environment for talents to emerge and play 
their full role. We will gradually build up a mechanism where 
talents can move from place to place in a rational manner; 
attach equal importance to training and employing professional 
people; continue to improve intellectuals' working and living 
conditions; and attach importance to training middle-aged as 
well as young intellectuals. We will strengthen management of 
and improve services to students who returned to China after 
studying abroad, so as to enable them to play their role in a 
better way. 
  Cultural undertakings should gear themselves to serving the 
people and socialism; adhere to the "double hundred" principle; 
energetically serve the central task of economic construction; 
and deepen reform in order to promote the development of 
literature and art. Literary and art workers should demonstrate 
a strong sense of devotion to their job as well as a sense of 
responsibility by creating more and better intellectual products 
that reflect the spirit of the era, that reflect the people's 
wishes and sentiments, and that are healthy, useful, lively, and 
rich in content. Theatrical troupes at the provincial, 
prefectural, and city levels should continue to forge ahead in 
invigorating and enriching Anhui's literature and art. We will 
improve cultural work at grassroots units and restore or set up 
rural cultural stations in order to enliven mass cultural and 
recreational activities in the countryside. We will strengthen 
administration of markets for cultural products according to the 
law; improve the quality of radio and television programs; 
expand the areas covered by radio and television programs; run 
rural cable broadcasting facilities well; improve the quality of 
publications; enrich the publishing industry; strengthen the 
protection of cultural relics; and attach importance to archival 
work. 
  We will expand health care services and sports activities so 
as to improve the people's health. We should attach a high 
degree of importance to health care work in rural areas, 
vigorously popularize primary health care services in rural 
areas, actively expand and improve rural cooperative health care 
services, strengthen the building of town and village clinics, 
county-level disease prevention, and health centers for women 
and children, and accelerate the completion of projects to 
improve drinking water and lavatories in rural areas. We will 
strive to bring iodine deficiency diseases under control and 
strengthen immunization against poliomyelitis. We will 
accelerate the elimination of endemic diseases, strengthen 
administration of pharmaceuticals, set strict standards for 
civilian-run or individual-run hospitals, and ensure good market 
order for pharmaceutical products. We will develop mass sports 
activities to improve the physical fitness of the people. We 
will be ready for the eighth national games and seriously 
prepare for the eighth provincial games. 
  We will earnestly intensify birth control work. The 
province's birth rate is still in its third peak period. This, 
coupled with great increases in the transient population brought 
about by economic development in urban and rural areas, has made 
birth control an extremely formidable task. We must continue to 
uphold the principle of being enthusiastic and forceful, of 
adopting stronger measures, and of moving to a new stage in 
order to effectively enforce birth control. Principle 
government leaders at all levels will personally attend to birth 
control work, and institute a strict system under which 
governments at all levels are responsible for attaining given 
objectives for birth control. We will strengthen fundamental 
work, improve the quality of four types of birth control 
surgical operations, tighten planned management over fixed and 
transient rural population, and speed up construction of a 
network which oversees birth control work in counties, 
townships, villages, and organizations. This year, we will 
ensure that we meet birth control objectives set by the state, 
and strive to lower our population growth rate to below 17 per 
thousand and the natural population growth rate to around 11 per 
thousand. 
VII. Intensify Efforts to Build Socialist Spiritual 
Civilization and the Democratic and Legal System 
  The keynote and focus of socialist spiritual civilization 
are 
on promoting the main theme of the epoch. We will adhere to 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, and strengthen propaganda, education, 
ideological, and political work according to the demand made by 
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the national conference on propaganda and 
ideological work. We will intensify research work in philosophy 
and social science under guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao 
Zedong Thought, and take the roles of philosophy and social 
science seriously. We will conduct extensive ideological 
education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism. We will 
also vigorously commend heroes and models from all front lines, 
emulate the lofty ideals and heroic deeds of Xu Honggang by 
showing readiness to take up the cudgels for a just cause and 
defy brute force, and promote the Lei Feng spirit of the new 
era. We will educate the vast numbers of cadres and people to 
become people who have lofty ideals and a sense of discipline 
and pay attention to unity and the overall situation. In 
particular, we will guide and educate teenagers more and 
cultivate a generation of new socialists. We will have a 
clear-cut stand in opposing money worshipping, out-and-out 
egoism, and decadent life style. We will conduct extensive 
education on civic mindedness and professional ethics, and 
promote hard work, thrift, and the spirit of waging hard battle 
so as to improve social ethics. 
  Democracy is an intrinsic characteristic of Socialism. 
Governments at all levels should conscientiously accept 
supervision by people's congresses and their standing 
committees; further enhance the functions of Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference committees, personages from 
democratic parties, public figures without party affiliation, 
and people's organizations in political consultations and 
democratic supervision; and improve on the democratic and 
scientific procedures for decisionmaking and handling 
administrative work. We will further foster closer ties between 
the government and masses, pay attention to letters sent in by 
the masses and visits by them, and earnestly accept rationalized 
suggestions from the masses. We will strengthen construction of 
political power in townships and towns, and improve 
village-level self-governing organizations. We will earnestly 
enhance the functions of workers' congresses, neighborhood 
committees, and village committees, and further arouse 
enthusiasm and stimulate the creativity of the broad masses of 
the people in building socialism. 
  We must strengthen the legal system in order to develop the 
market economy. We will strengthen legislative, judicial, 
administrative, and law enforcement work according to objectives 
set on construction of the legal system by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. We will actively 
govern the province and insist on administering according to 
law. We will conduct in-depth propaganda and education about 
the legal system; effectively carry out, from beginning to end, 
the "Second Five-Year Plan" to disseminate legal knowledge; and 
enhance society's awareness toward laws. Leading cadres at all 
levels will take the lead to study law and become adept at using 
legal means to manage economic and social affairs. We will 
develop the legal service ranks and improve their 
professionalism. We will fully bring into play the active 
functions of non-government mediation in grass-roots democratic 
construction. 
  We will make unremitting efforts to conduct education on 
national defense to enhance people's awareness in this respect. 
Governments at all levels will pay attention to national 
defense construction and support the army so that the latter 
will complete all tasks. We will further accomplish the task 
concerning militia reserve duty. The people's armed police force 
will strive to reform and reinforce itself. We will launch 
extensive and in-depth campaigns to promote support for the army 
and preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen 
and martyrs, support for the government and acts which cherish 
the people, and joint construction by the army and people as 
well as the police and people. We will implement the policy 
which gives special care to disabled servicemen and to family 
members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, earnestly help 
settle down armymen who have been transferred to civilian work 
and armymen who have retired, safeguard the armymen's lawful 
rights and interests, and consolidate and develop unity between 
the army and government, and the army and people. 
  We will earnestly implement policies toward nationalities 
and 
religions. We will effectively conduct propaganda and education 
on policies toward nationalities, strengthen management of 
religious affairs according to law, develop economics of 
nationalities, and promote unity between nationalities. 
  We will further fight corruption and promote honesty. We 
will intensify efforts to build a clean and honest government. 
A fundamental task in the construction of political power is to 
combat all corrupt phenomena. This is also an important 
guarantee for smooth progress in reform and development. 
Compared to what the central authorities demand and what the 
vast numbers of cadres and people want, our efforts to fight 
corruption and promote honesty have not yet been carried out 
evenly, even up to now, and we still face a rather arduous task. 
Governments at all levels must not relax their efforts at all. 
We must understand the urgency, difficulty, and complexity of 
our anti-corruption struggle; rely fully on the masses; treat 
the root cause as well as outward signs; and strive to score new 
results. We will strictly abide by central provisions 
concerning honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres, and 
seriously investigate cases involving violation of laws and 
discipline, particularly major and important cases. When 
checking unhealthy tendencies in trades and professions, we will 
continue to focus on curbing arbitrary collection of fees and 
use of public funds for overseas tours, and check unhealthy 
tendencies in key departments, trades, and professions. We will 
strengthen supervision and inspection, increase transparency in 
work to fight corruption and promote honesty, and ensure 
implementation of measures to fight corruption and promote 
honesty. 
  We will launch extensive campaigns to improve all facets of 
public order and severely crack down on all types of crimes. 
Improvement of public order is of immediate interest to the 
broad masses of people. It is also a prerequisite for smooth 
progress in reform, opening up, and economic construction. We 
will direct our efforts to further improve all facets of public 
order against new problems which have currently cropped up in 
public order, and severely crack down on all types of criminal 
activities and serious economic crimes. We will launch 
extensive struggle to wipe out the "six vices" and crack down on 
pornography. We will expand the public security and judicial 
ranks and strengthen their ideological education, set strict 
standards of conduct for the police, and improve the quality of 
our personnel and their law enforcement ability. 
  Stability is the important guarantee for reform and 
development [wen ding shi gai ge he fa zhan de zhong yao bao 
zheng 4489 1353 2508 2395 7245 0735 4099 1455 4104 6850 6008 
0202 6086]. Without a stable political situation and social 
order, we will not be in a position to say anything. The 
present situation on the whole is good, but we still have some 
hidden elements of instability [dan reng qian fu zhe yi xie bu 
an ding yin su 0141 0095 3383 0126 4192 0001 0067 0008 1344 1353 
0936 4790]. Governments at all levels, especially leading 
cadres at all levels, should be consciously aware of this. When 
we draw up measures for reform and development, we should insist 
on proceeding from actual conditions, foster close ties with the 
masses, listen attentively to them, and safeguard their 
interests. We should correctly handle contradictions among the 
people, work hard to nip elements which affect stability in the 
bud, and create a favorable social environment for reform and 
development. 
  Dear deputies, 
  We are at a very crucial period, and the heavy 
responsibility 
of building a socialist market economy and accelerating economic 
development have historically fallen on our shoulders. Let us 
move along the path shown by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, unite more 
closely around the party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as 
the core, firmly and unshakably implement the party's basic 
line, be of one heart and one mind and do practical work under 
the leadership of the Anhui Provincial CPC Committee, and 
struggle hard to fully vitalize all undertakings in Anhui!

  [Text] Guiyang, April 30 (CNS) -- China will develop its 
coal resources in Guizhou Province in the not-far-distant future 
in order to alleviate the pressures on coal transportation from 
the north to the south and to supply energy to the southeast 
coastal regions. 
  The development of coal resources in Guizhou would form a 
rational distribution of energy in the country. It is estimated 
that Guizhou's coal reserves rank third in the country and more 
than the total coal resources in ten or more of the southern 
provinces. 
  Guizhou's coal industry has been speeded up in recent years 
with newly-built and renovated projects going into production 
this year and next year and a batch of large-scale coal mines 
with a yearly output of three to four million tonnes will be 
built. Some power plants in coal mining areas will be built to 
realize the conversion of coal into electric power. 
  Experts from the State Planning Commission and the Ministry 
of Coal Industry have concluded, however, after a joint 
investigation into Guizhou's coal resources that coal 
development in Guizhou was impractical and failed to meet the 
demand for quality anthracite and coking coal in the south. 
Guizhou, in response, decided to jointly develop its coal 
resources with relevant departments and other provinces short of 
coal as well as with foreign investors to speed up the 
development of the coal industry there.

  [Text] Yinchuan, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Everything is now set in 
three poor counties in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous 
Region to improve land and train technical staff with the help 
of the World Food Program (WFP). 
  After an official inspection of the area, which aims to lift 
local farmers from poverty and improve the environment, a 
committee of experts from the WFP's Beijing office said they 
were quite satisfied with the preparation work and ensured the 
Chinese side that they could find no reason to delay the project. 
  As one of China's largest overseas aid projects in the past 
few years, the five-year project will involve aid in wheat worth 
13 million U.S. dollars from the WFP and 22.86 million yuan 
(about 2.5 million U.S. dollars) in investment from China's 
central and local governments. 
  The aid will be used for five major agriculture, forestry 
and 
water-conservancy projects in the three mountainous counties of 
Guyuan, Longde and Pengyan, located in the south of the region. 
  The project includes the construction of a group of 
reservoirs, wells, and technology centers to improve irrigation 
and transportation, and train technicians, especially women. 
  The illiteracy rate in the area is expected to drop from the 
existing 36.3 percent to 18.7 percent, provincial officials said. 
  When the project is completed in five years' time soil 
erosion will have been brought under control and water resources 
will have been protected, which is expected to double the output 
value and rescue 175,000 people from poverty, they said.

<F P=106> [Report: "Lu Ping Says Good Atmosphere Needed for Meeting </F>
With Patten"] 
  [Text] Yesterday (3 May), Lu Ping, vice chairman and 
secretary general of the Preliminary Working Committee, who is 
visiting Hong Kong, said that he hoped to meet Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten in the future in a better atmosphere so 
that they would really be able to achieve certain results 
through a meeting; at present, the Hong Kong Government was not 
friendly to the Preliminary Working Committee, so if he and the 
governor held personal talks, the talks might not achieve any 
results. 
  Last night, after attending a cocktail party held by XINHUA 
Hong Kong Branch in honor of the visiting mainland members of 
the Preliminary Working Committee, Lu Ping answered questions 
raised by reporters. When asked when he would meet with the 
Hong Kong governor, he said that he hoped there would be a 
better atmosphere so that both sides might actually achieve 
certain results through a meeting; otherwise, it would be 
meaningless if they met and achieved no result. 
  Lu Ping said: At present, the Hong Kong Government is not 
friendly enough toward the Preliminary Working Committee. It 
does not allow Hong Kong civil servants to meet committee 
members. In such circumstances, even if personal talks are held 
with the governor, the talks may not achieve any result. So it 
is better to first make some progress on certain issues through 
lower-level contacts through various channels, and then he may 
consider whether it is possible to achieve certain results 
through talks between him and the governor. 
  When talking about the airport issue, Lu Ping said that the 
two sides were still discussing issues concerning the airport 
project and the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. He believed 
that an option acceptable to both sides would be worked out. He 
hoped that agreement would be reached on the financial package 
and airport management regulations before long. 
  Lu Ping said that he came to Hong Kong this time in his 
capacity as vice chairman and secretary general of the 
Preliminary Working Committee to attend meetings of the 
political and economic affairs groups. The two groups are 
holding meetings in Hong Kong mainly for the purpose of enabling 
their members to listen to more opinions from various quarters 
in Hong Kong. He stressed that the task of the Preliminary 
Working Committee was to strive for a smooth transition in 1997, 
and he believed that a smooth transition represented the common 
wish of all Hong Kong residents. So he expects support and 
cooperation from the general public for the work of the 
Preliminary Working Committee, and the committee is also willing 
to listen to opinions from all quarters of the local community. 
  Lu Ping said that because he had to rush back to Beijing to 
handle some urgent matters, his schedule in Hong Kong was very 
busy. Many friends wanted to see him, but he did not have enough 
time, and he was sorry about that. He hoped that he would stay 
in Hong Kong for a longer period next time. When asked about 
his feelings about Hong Kong, he said that he did not have any 
special feelings because he did not go sightseeing in the 
streets. 
  Lu Ping asked the mass media to convey his regards to the 
residents of Hong Kong. He said that he had not visited Hong 
Kong in the last one or two years, and he really wanted to see 
what changes had occurred in various aspects. However, he had 
to attend meetings these days, so he could only greet Hong Kong 
people through the media.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin said here today that the relations between China and 
Japan are very good and that the two peoples should live in 
friendship from generation to generation. 
  Extending his welcome to Bunhei Hara, president of the House 
of Councillors of the Japanese Diet, and his delegation, Jiang 
noted that as close neighbors, China and Japan have had friendly 
contacts for more than 2,000 years. 
  Since the establishment of diplomatic ties more than 20 
years 
ago, great advances have been made in the bilateral friendly 
cooperation in every field, Jiang noted. 
  Speaking of an unfortunate historical period between the two 
countries, Jiang said "past experience, if not forgotten, is a 
guide for the future." 
  Leaders of the two countries should take a broad and 
long-term point of view and look forward to the future, he said, 
adding that they should further promote the mutually-beneficial 
cooperation in all fields and contribute to the safeguarding of 
peace, stability and prosperity in Asia and the world at large. 
  Hara told Jiang that his visit to Beijing, Xian and Shanghai 
has enabled him to witness the achievements China has made in 
its reform and opening-up and economic development. 
  Hara expressed his willingness to exert himself to the 
promotion of the Japan-China ties of friendship and cooperation. 
  Ye Gongqi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
Shanghai 
Municipal People's Congress, was present at today's meeting.

  [Text] Paris, May 4 (XINHUA) -- New Japanese Prime 
Minister Tustomu Hata, on a one-day official visit to France, 
said here today that it is improper for Japan's Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano to describe the Nanjing massacre as a 
"fabrication." 
  Hata's spokesman Kishichiro Amae told reporters that Hata 
said he himself was going to talk with Nagano about the issue. 
  Hata arrived here earlier today for talks with French 
leaders 
on the Naples summit of the Group of Seven most industrialized 
countries scheduled for July. 
  Hata reiterated his viewpoint on the past history: "Japan 
had 
launched a war of colonialism and aggression, which had caused 
huge agony and catastrophes to many peoples. Therefore, every 
Japanese should envisage the history of that period and, 
together with the Japanese Government, never allow similar 
events to occur." 
  "This is of vital importance," he stressed. 
  In an interview with Japan's major daily newspaper "MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN" Tuesday, Nagano, who was appointed by Hata just last 
week, termed the 1937 Nanjing massacre as a "fabrication" and 
even denied Japanese invasion of other nations during the second 
world war. 
  Nagano, a 71-year-old senior member of Hata's Japan renewal 
party, said it was "wrong" to call Japan's invasion of its Asian 
neighbors in the 1930s and 1940s aggression, according to the 
newspaper. 
  "I think the Nanjing massacre is a fabrication, and it is 
wrong to describe the war as a war of aggression," Nagano said. 
  In December 1937, Japanese invasion troops occupied Nanjing, 
the then Chinese capital, and slaughtered up to 300,000 innocent 
Chinese civilians and prisoners of war in the city. The 
notorious massacre has been proved by undeniable evidence. 
  Nagano, who graduated from a Japanese military academy, 
joined Japanese invasion troops to China during World War II. 
He entered the Self-Defense Force (SDF) after the war, was once 
chief of staff of the SDF ground force and retired from the 
military in 1980. 
  Last year, then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Japan 
had undertaken a war of aggression against its Asian neighbors 
during World War II. 
  Hata said last July that Japan should apologize for its war 
atrocities.

  [Text] Seoul, May 5 (XINHUA) -- South Korea expressed 
regret Thursday [5 May] over the remarks by Japanese Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano that his country was not an aggressor in 
World War II and the war was aimed at liberation of colonies. 
  The South Korean Government is looking into a real intention 
behind Nagano's remarks, a senior Foreign Ministry official said. 
  The official said that he felt sorry for a cabinet minister 
of the Japanese Government intent on a reformist politics and 
contribution to the international community to have such a 
consciousness of history. 
  "The remarks might taint efforts by the Japanese people to 
redress the past," he maintained. 
  Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 until Japan's World 
War II defeat in 1945. 
  Nagano stirred the controversy in an interview with the 
Japanese national newspaper MAINICHI Tuesday by claiming that 
the Pacific war was not a war of aggression and was instead 
designed for liberation of colonies and a Greater East Asia 
Co-Prosperity Sphere. 
  He also asserted that the "rape of Nanking" by Japanese 
soldiers in 1937 was a hoax. Nanking is presently spelled 
Nanjing. 
  However, new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is on 
a visit in France, Wednesday described as "inappropriate" 
remarks made by his justice minister dismissing the killing of 
an estimated 300,000 Chinese civilians by Japanese troops in 
1937 in Nanjing, the Chinese capital then. 
  "My view on the past history is that our past actions, 
including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable 
suffering and sorrow for many people," Hata said in a brief 
statement shortly after arriving in Paris for a two-day official 
visit. 
  Nagano's remarks contrast sharply with the views of Japan's 
previous administration, which left office last week. Former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called World War II "a war of 
aggression" and said it was wrong. 
  Hosokawa reiterated this recognition by Japan when he 
visited 
China earlier this year.

  [Text] Seoul, May 4 (XINHUA) -- More than 2,000 students 
from 40 universities in the Seoul area demonstrated here today, 
urging the United States to withdraw its troops from South Korea 
and opposing the government's decision to open the country's 
rice market. 
  The students condemned the U.S. for posing a nuclear war 
threat to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and 
creating a war atmosphere on the Korean peninsula. 
  They called for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and a peace 
pact between the U.S. and the DPRK. 
  Some 37,000 American troops are now stationed in South Korea 
and the U.S. deployed Patriot missiles in South Korea last month 
in the name of enhancing its ally's defense capabilities against 
the DPRK. 
  The demonstrators also accused the South Korean government 
of 
opening the domestic rice market and called on the National 
Assembly not to approve the government's final documents related 
to the world trade accord of the Uruguay Round. 
  Police forces were mobilized but no clash was reported 
during 
the demonstration. 
  Earlier today, some 400 students staged a demonstration near 
the American center in Kwangju, capital of South Korea's South 
Cholla Province, charging the U.S. with creating a war 
atmosphere on the Korean peninsula. 
  The students tried to storm into the American center but 
were 
blocked by riot police firing tear gas. 
  A clash between the police and students wielding paint 
bottles and rocks followed, wounding some 10 policemen and 
students who were then taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Do a Good Job in the Comprehensive </F>
Management of Public Order To Achieve Long-Term Peace and 
Stability in the Rural Areas"] 
  [Text] The fundemental problems in our country's economic 
development and modernization are agrticulture, rural areas, and 
the peasants. The 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee demanded the 
further deepening of rural reforms, accelerating rural economic 
development, and strengthening the role of agriculture as the 
economic foundation to ensure that it moves up to a new level by 
the end of this century. This is an arduous and urgent task 
confronting the entire party and people throughout the whole 
country. 
  To open a new dimension in rural reforms and development, it 
is necessary to have a stable and harmonious social environment 
in rural areas. Since the beginning of reform and opening up, 
guided by the party's rural policies, our country's rural 
economy has developed greatly and the living standards of 
peasants have risen considerably, with the majority of peasants 
living and working contentedly and happily. The pursuit of 
socialist spiritual civilization in rural areas has also scored 
great achievements. However, it should be seen that public order 
in our country's rural areas in recent years has not been 
satisfactory. The public order situation in rural areas is 
chaotic and this is not only affecting the normal life of the 
broad mass of peasants but is also impeding efforts to further 
deepen rural reforms and increase the pace of developing the 
rural economy. 
  To stabilize the public order situation in rural areas, it 
is 
necessary to crack down on various crimes. In particular, 
felons, criminals with long criminal records, recidivists, and 
criminal gang leaders, local thugs and village brutes who 
terrorize localities must be resolutely punished according to 
law and, in this, there should be no mercy. Only thus can the 
arrogance of lawbreaking criminals be punctured, the righteous 
spirit overpower the evil spirit, and can the situation in rural 
areas whereby good people are brutalized by villains, be 
rectified. 
  To improve public order in rural areas, it is also necessary 
to double the efforts to pursue socialist spiritual civilization 
and to eradicate the influence of all kinds of corruption, 
feudalism, backwardness, and superstitious thinking in rural 
areas. To this end, it is necessary to change the situation in 
rural work whereby "one type of work is stressed at the expense 
of another." In pursuing rural economic construction well, we 
must pay great attention to guidance and education for the 
peasants, especially socialist ideological education and 
education in the legal system. We must adopt forms welcomed and 
accepted by the peasants which enrich peasants' cultural lives 
and allow advanced and healthy ideology and culture to take over 
the spiritual realm and cultural markets in the vast rural areas. 
  One proven method for the pursuit of a comprehensive 
management of public order in rural areas is to believe in and 
rely on the masses, fully motivate the broad peasant masses, and 
mobilize them into taking the initiative. Local rural areas 
must learn from the positive experiences of some localities 
which did a good job in public order, mobilize and organize the 
broad peasant masses, provide mass prevention and remedy by 
making use of peasants' own power, and direct the public order 
work down to villages, units, households, and individuals. This 
will improve the peasants' ability to protect themselves and 
their property and to guard against transgressions, lawbreaking, 
and criminal behavior, so that results reaped will be double the 
amount of effort made. 
  All comprehensive measures must depend on dynamic and 
resourceful organization for implementation. Therefore, it is 
necessary to boost grass-roots party and government 
organizations in rural areas to make them really capable of 
carrying out the arduous work demanded by various comprehensive 
measures. At present, village party branches and village 
committees in some rural areas are basically paralyzed. There 
are no authorities in villages, the masses are as disorganized 
as a pan of sand, and nobody is responsible for the 
comprehensive management of public order and other tasks and 
measures. Villages are powerless against local thugs and 
village brutes and the evil tendency grows unchecked. Party 
committees and governments at all levels must: Adopt resolute 
and powerful measures to rectify and strengthen grass-roots 
party and government organizations; transfer capable, 
responsible, and courageous comrades to grass-roots 
organizations, and firmly expel those who are weak and cringe 
before bad people and bad things, or even conspire and collude 
with local thugs, so that grass-roots party and government 
organizations can become bastions with stronger muscles for work. 
  Party committees and governments at all levels have a great 
responsibility in stabilizing rural social order. They must 
unify thinking around reform, opening up, and economic 
construction and efforts must revolve around rural social 
stability. Party committees and governments at all levels, 
especially those in relatively economically backward areas, must 
try their best to develop the rural economy and work hard to 
raise the material well- being of the masses. Party and 
government officials of all ranks must overcome bureaucratism, 
venture deep into the grass roots, listen to the voices of the 
peasants, perform practical services for them, and solve 
practical problems. Leading party and government comrades at 
all levels must strictly enforce the responsibility system in 
the comprehensive management of public order; conscientiously 
organize the comprehensive management of public order in rural 
areas and tackle such work properly; vigorously support 
comprehensive rural management work in the areas of policy 
guidance, organizational establishment and improvement, 
staffing, and capital and equipment; and hold individual leaders 
accountable for failing to fulfil their assigned 
responsibilities in the comprehensive management of public order 
in rural areas. 
  The comprehensive management of public order in rural areas 
is an important task which allows only success and not failure. 
If the problem of rural public order is solved and social order 
is stable, rural reforms and economic construction can steadily 
deepen. If the rural economy is developed and the role of 
agriculture as the economic foundation is secure, the stability 
of the whole nation will be based on a solid foundation and the 
further deepening of reform and opening up will have a powerful 
safeguard. Otherwise, there will be chaos and turmoil in rural 
areas and the very root of the progress of our country's 
socialist modernization will be jeopardized. All party members 
and cadres, especially comrades with responsibility in rural 
areas and those with leadership and management duties in rural 
public order, must understand the importance of public order 
work in rural areas, implement all comprehensive management 
measures by the central authorities, and struggle actively for 
long-term peace and stability in rural areas!

  [Text] Zhuhai, May 4 (CNS) -- Chinese Vice Premier Li 
Lanqing made a two-day inspection tour of Zhuhai on April 30 and 
May 1 accompanied by the Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, 
Mr. Liu Weiming, and the Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, Ms. Wu Yi, as well as directors of other 
departments under the State Council. During the inspection, Mr. 
Li said that the special economic zones (SEZ) should maintain 
their special characteristics and get rid of old ideas and seek 
more ways for economic development so as to set an example for 
China's inland areas. 
  Mr. Li said that the SEZs should be clear about the distance 
between them and conventional international practice. The State 
Council planned to set up certain enterprises on a trial basis 
in the SEZs to spread their experience in the mainland and see 
how they can be run in line with conventional international 
practice. 
  He also said that some reform experiments may proceed first 
in such zones as Zhuhai. For example 24-hour customs service 
with Macao and large-scale bonded zones set up in Zhuhai should 
be considered. 
  Following his inspection of key projects in Zhuhai such as 
harbours, the airport and railways, Mr. Li said that Zhuhai had 
shown a fast speed of construction and he hoped for a better 
investment environment there to attract a high level of foreign 
capital.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Li Lanqing, 
vice-premier of the State Council, said here that the current 
situation of Chinese foreign trade is good, but the cost 
per-unit for earning foreign exchange is increasing too fast. 
  He stressed that it is necessary to strictly ban driving up 
prices to collect commodities for export and ban underselling of 
goods. 
  He noted that the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation has invited bidding for trading a dozen commodities 
for export. This practice has produced good results and proved 
to be useful in bringing forced price rises of commodities 
collected for export and underselling under control. It is 
imperative to sum up these experiences and to popularize the 
practice as soon as possible, the vice-premier said. 
  He also stressed that effective measures should be taken to 
prevent the property of state-owned foreign trade enterprises 
from being drained off. 
  Vice-Premier Li made these remarks during his April 29-May 3 
survey tour of south China's Guangdong Province. 
  During his stay in Guangdong, the vice-premier visited the 
75th China Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair, Huangpu Customs, a 
free-trade zone, the new Zhuhai Airport and some state-owned 
enterprises. He made an all-round investigation into the 
implementation of some reform measures. 
  He said that in order to build the basic framework of a 
socialist market economic system, the Chinese Central Government 
has taken a series of reform measures in the systems of finance 
and taxation, banking, modern enterprises, investment, foreign 
trade and foreign exchange. Judging by the situation in the 
first four months of this year, all the measures have fared 
well. He urged leaders at all levels to pay close attention to 
the issue of revitalizing large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises. He also discussed ideas on revitalizing 
state-owned foreign trade enterprises with local officials and 
entrepreneurs. 
  On the development of special economic zones in the future, 
the vice-premier said that they should follow international 
conventions to further improve their environment for investment 
and lay the emphasis on attracting investment from large 
multinationals. 
  He stressed the necessity of constantly fighting against 
smuggling and the importance of running the free-trade zones 
well. 
  He also brought special attention to education, saying that 
universities should try to find an effective method for arousing 
the enthusiasm of all circles and strengthening domestic and 
international cooperation to raise educational levels and train 
personnel suited to the development of a socialist market 
economy.

<F P=106> [By Yu Youxian (0060 0645 0341): "Adhere to the Set </F>
Direction and Deepen Reforms To Achieve a Phased Change in Press 
and Publication Work"] 
  [Text] The press and publication industry is a key sector 
of spiritual production in our country. The press and 
publication sector plays the role of organizing spiritual 
production, synthesizing it into products, directing the 
products into circulation, and making sure they achieve the 
proper social and economic effects through the market and 
exchange. One key trait of press and publication work is the 
close and inseparable integration of spiritual and material 
production and social and economic effects, the process itself 
being subject to the laws of spiritual, as well as material, 
production. This fundamentally determines that the development 
of press and publication corresponds with reforms in economic 
structures and stages of economic development, and that it is 
identical with the requirements and progress of socialist 
spiritual civilization. Development and changes in press and 
publication are inevitably tied with development and changes in 
the socialist cause as a whole. 
<H5>  1. The Press and Publication Sector Faces Phased Changes. </H5>
  Our country's press and publication sector has developed 
rapidly over the last 10 years or so, along with the progress of 
reform and opening up. Statistics compiled by UNESCO show that 
China's publication has leaped to the world's forefront in scale 
and variety. Unprecedented development in the press and 
publication sector has profoundly influenced the spiritual state 
of our country and played an important role in promoting reform 
and opening up and economic construction. At the same time, the 
press and publication sector, and especially publication, is 
facing significant changes after decades of rapid development. 
In terms of stages of development, the press and publication 
sector is moving from a stage distinguished by actual increases 
in total volume to that distinguished by high quality and 
efficiency. In terms of means of management, the press and 
publication sector is moving away from detailed 
administrative-style management to law-guided and macroscopic 
management. In terms of structural reforms, the press and 
publication sector is changing from traditional nonprofit-making 
management into industrial management on its way toward a modern 
corporate system. Changes in these three directions are all 
difficult and complicated processes moving at different paces 
and with different focuses, while being all interconnected and 
mutually constrained and interacting. At the center of these 
three changes is the shift of the press and publication sector 
away from gross growth in volume to high quality and efficiency. 
  Such a phased change is determined by the following two 
factors: First, the pursuit of the two civilizations is making 
higher demands on the press and publication sector, which cannot 
strengthen its power and intensity in serving the two 
civilizations without improving its quality and economic 
efficiency. Second, the press and publication industry would 
not be competitive enough to survive and develop if, now that 
they are facing the market, they did not improve quality and 
economic efficiency and rationalize their internal resources. 
This phased change in the press and publication sector, which 
has already happened and will continue in the future, has been 
basically in step with the entire reform and opening up and with 
the change in economic construction from total volume growth to 
rising economic returns in our country. The development of the 
press and publication sector has its own peculiarity and 
complications and is not identical with similar situations 
experienced in economic construction. But it is true that the 
two are, on the whole, similar to the extent that both are 
moving away from total volume growth toward high quality and 
efficiency. Strategically speaking, this phased change is 
further adjusting and strengthening the power of the press and 
publication sector in preparation for greater breakthroughs to 
come. We must be clearly aware of and value this ongoing change 
in the press and publication sector, and create conditions to 
promote it. There are wide-ranging problems and possibilities 
in the press and publication sector, and there are many things 
requiring our energy and attention. Overall and from a 
macroscopic point of view, this is a strategically significant 
matter. 
  To achieve an even greater change from total volume growth 
to 
high quality and efficiency, the press and publication sector 
must, subjectively, make great effort and acquire the necessary 
objective conditions. 
  The objective conditions we currently possess are: First, 
the general background for such an important change is there. In 
their "Decisions on Certain Problems Concerning the Creation of 
a Socialist Market Economic System," the central authorities 
specifically brought up the problems of overall balance, 
structural optimization, and healthy development; and in 
particular the fact that rural economic development should be 
characterized by "structural adjustment and raising economic 
returns." An increasingly popular economic concept over the 
last two years has been the "awareness of the quality of the 
national economy." There has been some change in the tendency 
to pay too much attention to economic rates at the expense of 
economic quality, to habitually expand the external scale 
instead of tapping into internal resources, and to neglect 
quality efficiency. The people, party, and state are all 
demanding quality, and they have designated a year as "quality 
year" and organized events such as a "long distance walk for 
quality." All these indicate that the general background for 
the change in economic construction from total volume growth to 
high quality and efficiency is in place, providing an excellent 
opportunity for promoting phased changes in the press and 
publication sector. Second, there is a general appreciation of 
the importance and urgency of improving the quality and 
efficiency of the press and publication sector. Society is 
calling for improvement in quality and an effort to overcome 
ordinariness and shoddiness and sweep away junk culture. The 
press and publication sector has realized the seriousness of the 
problem and is working to solve it. One key Marxist viewpoint 
is that when there is a general awareness of a problem, there 
are already a popular forum and objective conditions for solving 
this problem. Third, some units and localities have made some 
fruitful explorations in moving toward and adapting to the 
market, forming their own methods of operation and operating 
mechanisms, and have accumulated some experiences in raising 
quality and efficiency. Thanks to the effort of leading 
departments to champion the idea and the work of all the news 
workers and publishers, the change in the press and publication 
sector from total volume growth to high quality and efficiency 
is now underway. The only problem is that we have not 
explicitly characterized the change, much less declared and 
promoted it. 
  However, the conditions described above are far from enough 
to effect a greater scope of change in the press and publication 
sector from total volume growth to high quality and efficiency. 
We need to make a greater and varied effort. Here we need 
directional guidance, the assurance of law, and a deepening of 
reform to find a way out; we need to employ more party and state 
power and coordinate it with market forces to put in place a 
management system and operating mechanism capable of being 
adjusted to socialist economic development, meeting the demands 
of the pursuit of spiritual civilization, and in line with the 
law of development in the press and publication sector. 
<H5>  2. Adhere to the Set Direction, Guide the Change, and Serve </H5>
the People and Socialism With Higher Quality and Efficiency. 
  There is a problem of direction as well a problem of 
ideological levels and cultural cultivation in trying to raise 
quality and efficiency. 
  On the problem of political direction, the major thing in 
the 
current stage of politics in our country is upholding Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as the guiding thought, enforcing and carrying 
out the party's basic line, and pursuing socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The most fundamental and important missions 
for the press and publication sector are to provide spiritual 
force, intellectual support, ideological guarantees, and a good 
climate of public opinion for achieving the party's general task 
and objectives. Convictions must not be shaken, the political 
line must not be disrupted, and stability and unity must not be 
undermined. There are many widely different tasks in serving 
the people and socialism, but upholding a correct political 
direction serves the people and socialism best. Only by sticking 
to a correct political direction from beginning to end can we 
raise the quality and efficiency of press and publication work 
in a better manner. If things go wrong in the political sphere, 
the resulting damage will be far greater than can be calculated 
in terms of losses in quality and efficiency. This year has 
seen the unveiling of the greatest number of reformist measures 
and reforms of the greatest intensity. Press and publication 
work must remain united, stable, and energetic, and maintain the 
policy of positive propaganda in order create a relaxed and 
harmonious environment for reform and opening up. 
  On the problem of ideological uprightness and integrity, 
since the socialist press and publication sector is entrusted 
with the important task of training and fostering a new 
generation of idealistic, moral, and cultured socialists, it 
must offer the most advanced, beautiful, and healthiest 
ideological and cultural fruits. The development of reform and 
opening up and a market economy has brought us opportunity and 
vitality, but overseas influence and greed have also exposed 
some people to epicureanism, the cult of money, and extreme 
individualism. To further promote reform and opening up and 
resist erosion toward an unhealthy climate, the press and 
publication sector should provide more and better spiritual 
products and a much stronger spiritual force goading people to 
carry on the struggle. The broad mass of news and publishing 
workers have contributed much in this respect. However, a small 
number of units and individuals have put out publications 
advocating money worship, epicureanism, and extreme 
individualism for the sake of money. The lesson was profound. 
  Regarding cultural cultivation, we link cultural cultivation 
with the problem of direction because without certain cultural 
cultivation, it is simply not possible to achieve either 
political or ideological orientation. The standards of 
published cultural products impact directly the attempt by the 
press and publication sector to raise its own status and 
dimension and improve the quality of our people. In this 
respect, it is extremely necessary to link standards of cultural 
cultivation with the problem of direction. 
  In sum, the problem of direction for the press and 
publication sector is not a simple political slogan, but a 
synthesis of politics, ideology, integrity, and cultivation. 
And solving the problem of direction relies not only on the 
stance taken and becoming aware of it; an ability to combine 
different qualities and operations is needed. Solving the 
problem of direction requires us to handle well the relations 
between economic effects and social effects, between the main 
theme and its variations, between Marxist guidance and the 
absorption of as much of mankind's advanced ideological 
achievements as possible, and inheriting and developing the 
positive cultural elements in the national tradition, and 
between handling high-plane and sophisticated elitist things and 
popularization. Only when political direction, ideological 
orientation, and cultural cultivation are all upheld in dealing 
with all the above relations can we say the direction has 
genuinely been upheld. 
<H5>  3. Manage According to Law, Protect the Change, and Create </H5>
an Environment of Fair Competition and Healthy Order for 
Achieving High Quality and Efficiency 
  The effort to achieve phased changes in the press and 
publication sector under a new historical condition depends to a 
very large extent on a strengthened legal system and a 
law-guided management system. Through law-guided management, 
the protection of healthy forces, and curbing and cracking down 
on illegal behavior, conditions will be created for fair 
competition leading to the survival of the fittest, which will 
in turn create a healthy and orderly environment in which the 
press and publication sector can develop in a high-quality and 
efficient manner. Through law-guided management, concerned 
departments will be gradually relieved of microscopic management 
to concentrate on macromanagement. 
  In a certain sense, a market economy is a law-guided 
economy. 
Under a planned economy, management on the press and publication 
sector is realized through direct management by leading party 
and government departments. As the socialist market economy 
unfolds, press and publication will evolve into common social 
activities, with the value of law facilitating or constraining 
ever more greatly their development, rendering pure party 
discipline and specific administrative-style management 
increasingly inadequate. Under a market economy, law-guided 
management will play an increasingly larger role. 
  While there has been significant progress over these last 
few 
years in national and local legislation for press and 
publication, work in this area remains lagging far behind the 
real situation. This is because we do not have much experience 
to start with, and on the other hand, we need practice in 
legislation. From practice we can identify and shape our 
legislation work. We cannot impose in advance a legal framework 
on a developing and changing reality. At any rate, legislation 
lagging behind the objective reality has created much trouble 
and difficulty for us. The situation in the press and 
publication sector has showed time and time again the lack of 
law enforcement, a situation awaiting urgent rectification. 
<H5>  4. Deepen Reforms, Speed Up the Change, Move Closer To </H5>
Creating an Operating Mechanism of High Quality and Efficiency. 
  The main thrust of reforms in the press and publication 
sector over the last decade or so has been removing the sector 
from the dictates of the planned economy in advancing toward a 
socialist market economic system. Reforms in press and 
publication have unfolded along with the gestation, formation, 
and development of a socialist market economic system. In 
switching from the old to a new system, press and publication 
work will run into many new situations, problems, and 
contradictions. 
  (1) Change further the operating mechanisms of publication 
units; nonprofitmaking units will be managed as an enterprise, 
moreover such enterprise-style management will be given a 
greater role later; operating mechanisms suited to the 
development of the socialist market economic system will be 
created in order to increase the adaptability, competitiveness, 
the self-development ability, and scientific management of the 
publication sector in a market economy. This is an important 
task for the publication sector in deepening reforms. 
  Reforms in the publication sector must slowly put in place a 
corporate publication system. Units in need of state subsidies 
will be run as nonprofitmaking units, while the majority will be 
managed as enterprises, but both will need a corporate system, 
in which their responsibility will be strictly defined so that 
they will have powers as well as official duties; and discipline 
and law breakers will be severely punished and observers of law 
and duties vigorously supported. 
  The switch of operating mechanisms in the publication sector 
should start with personnel, labor, and distribution as the 
points of breakthrough ushering in other reformist measures. 
Through reform in these three systems, an incentive mechanism 
will be formed in the publication sector prodding workers to 
explore and create. The establishment of press and publication 
groups is another exploration by some provinces and cities in 
press and publication reforms. Such groups help consolidate and 
expand the scale of production, concentrate all the energy on 
big projects, and go into market competition as a group. As 
such they will strengthen management and guide opinion. The 
experiment in such groups should take account of practical 
situations, work on the basis of voluntary participation by 
press and publication units and the management- ownership 
relationship, which will be one of mutual interests instead of 
administrative subordination. As conditions in localities vary, 
there cannot be uniformity. But as reforms in the press and 
publication sector deepen, there will emerge a number of various 
press and publication groups based on a management-ownership 
relation playing a greater role in promoting production 
structural adjustment and raising efficiency and quality. 
  (2) On fostering and developing the book market system: 
At present, a great many contradictions in the publication 
sector are found in the distribution area, so reforms in the 
distribution system are the key to deepening publication 
reforms. Right now the most important thing is to enliven 
further distribution and create a market environment with fair 
competition so as to form a unified, open, orderly, and 
competitive national book market. 
  The focus of reforms in the distribution system is on 
enlivening the operating mechanisms of XINHUA Bookstores. 
XINHUA Bookstores are the main channels of book distribution in 
our country and have made significant contributions over the 
last several decades. However, as reform and opening up deepened 
and the socialist market economic system developed, XINHUA 
Bookstores began to run into difficulties and face new problems, 
which they need to solve urgently through deepening reforms. 
Reforms in XINHUA Bookstores must proceed in three directions. 
One, the distribution agent experiment should be pursued to 
enliven the wholesale area and widen wholesale channels so that 
the main channels can play a real role in book circulation. 
Two, reforms are needed in the forms of purchases and sales, 
which allow different types of sales agents such as 
distributors, sales on consignment, and sales agents. Three, we 
should promote reforms in the management-ownership system of 
XINHUA Bookstores in order to enliven their operating 
mechanisms. Experiments in contracting, franchising, the 
joint-stock system, and nongovernmental management of 
government-owned units conducted by localities in recent years 
are all good pursuits to enliven grass- roots bookstores. We 
should actively promote cross-regional wholesale book markets 
and pay great attention to establishing wholesale markets in 
underdeveloped regions. At the same time, we must vigorously 
develop book sales networks. The distribution of newspapers and 
magazines, while supporting and perfecting this above-described 
main channel, should be allowed to pursue alternative channels 
of distribution. Management and guidance on individual-run 
distribution must be strengthened with the purpose of 
encouraging these individuals to maintain self-discipline 
through industrial associations and urging them to play an 
active role in enlivening book markets. 
  (3) Strengthen and improve macromanagement. Strengthening 
and improving the macromanagement on press and publication 
administrations is an important issue in press and publication 
reforms. Under the new situation, press and publication 
administrations urgently need to change their management 
functions so that they may be relieved from busy and minor 
administrative affairs to concentrate their energy on 
macroregulation and control, and study intensively to deal with 
the new situation and solve new problems cropping up in the 
transition from the old to a new system. That way they can take 
new steps in theory, policies, rules and regulations, and 
systems, and ensure that press and publication reform progresses 
smoothly from the stage of total volume growth to that of high 
quality and efficiency. Strengthening theoretical study and 
exploring the law of development in the press and publication 
sector are an important link in the pursuit of strengthening 
management. With such important spiritual production as the 
press and publication sector and the complicated situation in 
the press and publication sector brought about by economic 
change, it will be very difficult to work without theoretical 
guidance, an strategic insight into the overall situation, and 
an ability to keep the overall situation under control. 
However, it is precisely in these aspects that we lack 
theoretical preparation. The absence of theoretical study in 
the management of the press and publication sector and its 
development, especially the law of development in the 
publication sector, and in the "opportunities" and "problems" 
brought to the press and publication sector by "development" and 
"reforms," has in fact affected and impeded our work. We must 
pay greater attention to investigations, studies, and 
theoretical work in order to improve our ability to analyze the 
situation and solve problems. We must step up investigations 
and studies on practical problems related to press and 
publication reforms. This can be done by making explorations 
and experiments under the guidance of theory, and continuously 
abstracting and elevating what we gained in exploration and 
practice to a theoretical level. The focus for macroregulation 
and control over press and publication work is coming to grips 
with: Orientation, total volume, structure, and economic 
returns. Under longstanding administrative management we have 
accumulated a lot of experience, but it will not be nearly 
enough under a socialist market economy. We need to learn to 
use economic and legal means and public opinion, especially 
legal means, in management in our effort to open a new dimension 
in macromanagement. 
  (4) Rely on scientific and technological progress in 
promoting the development of the press and publication sector. 
As an key component in information industry, the press and 
publication sector must make a great effort to modernize the 
means of publication and business management. It must conduct 
technological transformation, speed up editing, type-setting, 
printing, and binding, and modernize management in order to 
raise the status of its products, labor productivity, management 
levels, quality, and economic returns. There should be different 
priorities in technological transformation. Emphasis must be 
placed on starting at high technological levels, and there must 
be determined efforts at combining technological development, 
imports, and transformation, with special emphasis on electronic 
technology, in order to solve key technological problems in the 
development of the press and publication sector. 
<H5>  5. Promote Prosperity, Realize the Change, and Provide </H5>
Society With Rich, Varied, High-Quality, and High-Class 
Spiritual Products 
  The effort to achieve the change from total volume growth to 
high quality and efficiency in the press and publication sector 
is ultimately aimed at prosperity, which is chiefly marked by a 
rough equilibrium between total supply by the press and 
publication sector and total demand by the people and social 
development, and an overall rationalized book and magazine 
structure. Prosperity means more than growth in volume; it 
requires also quality on a certain scale and at a certain level 
of volume. 
  In promoting prosperity, we must focus on construction. 
Both administrative departments and news units must take 
construction as the point of departure and the basis. This is a 
long-term and arduous mission and must be pursued 
systematically. A long-term and general plan and a practical 
current work program are both needed, and we will pursue both of 
them in a down-to-earth fashion. Guiding thought on specific 
operations must be clear, with focuses highlighted and work 
objectives clearly defined, and there must be strong operability 
and clear effect forecasts. The Press the Publication 
Administration is implementing the Eighth Five-Year Plan and 
will begin drafting the Ninth Five-Year Plan. They are great 
events for spiritual production in our country and require all 
the nation's energy; not only that from the press and 
publication sector, but from the entire editors' and writers' 
force, or even the whole array of spiritual production. 
  The working force remains the core problem in promoting 
prosperity. The key to prosperity and progress toward high 
quality and efficiency for the press and publication sector lies 
in its working force. The sector has its special requirements 
on its working force. They must all have special academic 
training and, moreover, integrity and a sophisticated state of 
mind. They must have the capability to work on spiritual 
production and to organize spiritual production, appreciate the 
fruits of domestic and foreign civilizations, and understand 
domestic and overseas markets. The key to building up a working 
force lies in the establishment of leadership groups, and one 
important problem in establishing leadership groups is clean 
government. On this we must work strictly according to relevant 
central decrees. 
  The press and publication sector is an important sector in 
our country's spiritual civilization. Central leading comrades 
repeatedly stressed that work in this sector can only become 
increasingly important and play an increasingly greater role, 
and the sector can only be strengthened, not weakened. Given 
the situation, it is all the more necessary for us to heighten 
our sense of responsibility and mission and work cautiously and 
in a down-to-earth manner. We are at a historical juncture 
between the planned economy and socialist market economic system 
reforms, and our news and publishing workers are at an important 
link of spiritual civilization; they are at center stage now. 
Faced with the phased change from the stage distinguished by 
total volume growth to that by high quality and efficiency in 
the press and publication sector, we feel, on the one hand, hard 
pressed, and on the other hand, proud. We must treasure this 
historic opportunity, value the trust and expectations of party 
and people, emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, do our 
best, and pursue creative work, and with it bring a new stage of 
development to the press and publication sector.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Ning: "From State Treasury to Real </F>
Bank"; first paragraph is BEIJING REVIEW introduction] 
  [Text] China will transform the People's Bank of China 
into a real central bank and specialized banks into real 
commercial banks. A number of policy-related banks will be set 
up to engage in policy-related business. 
  Prior to 1978, the People's Bank of China was the only one 
in 
the nation. It was not only the bank for monetary issue, but 
also the center for credit, settlement and cash receipt and 
payment. Therefore, it was dubbed a monetary issue company or 
state treasury. 
  At the end of 1978, China embarked on its reform and opening 
policies. Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform 
and opening, instructed in 1979 that "banks should be real 
banks," which raised the curtain on the country's financial 
system reform. 
  Between 1979 and 1985, the Agricultural Bank of China and 
the 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China were set up; the Bank of 
China was separated from the People's Bank of China as a 
specialized exchange bank engaging in international settlement 
and foreign trade credit; the People's Construction Bank of 
China became independent from the Ministry of Finance to handle 
part of credit business. In 1984, the People's Bank of China 
began to act as the central bank. 
  From 1986 to 1993, China established nine commercial banks, 
including the Bank of Communications, the CITIC Industrial Bank, 
the Merchant Bank, the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Fujian 
Industrial Bank, the Guangdong Development Bank, the Everbright 
Bank, the Huaxia Bank and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. 
Their emergence put an end to the monopoly of state specialized 
banks and promoted competition in China's banking industry. 
  However, economic operations over the last 10 years have 
exposed undeniable shortcomings in the existing financial 
system. The central bank does not behave like a central bank, 
and neither do the commercial banks act accordingly. With its 
macroregulation and control measures still characteristic with 
those of a planned economy, the central bank fails to play its 
due role in implementing the state monetary policy and in 
managing and supervising national financial activities. It 
handles its own policy related loans and runs investment and 
trust companies. In the interim, the specialized banks handle 
commercial as well as policy-related business. With fund 
operations conducted in accordance with planned indicators and 
administrative instructions, the specialized banks have no 
autonomy to choose where to put money and therefore credit risk 
does not exist. 
  The still not thoroughly reformed financial system certainly 
failed to withstand the pounding of the socialist market economy 
and the rapid development of the national economy after 1992. 
In the first half of 1993 chaotic phenomena like fraudulence in 
money raising and loan calling cropped up in the financial 
market. This aggravated the excessive growth of investment in 
capital construction and fixed assets, inflation and steep price 
increases. 
  The Chinese government shifted the focus of reform and 
opening onto finance. 
  On July 2, 1993, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji was appointed 
president of the People's Bank of China, a post concurrent with 
his existing one. As soon as he took office, Zhu called a 
working conference on national finance. Zhu put forward the 14 
measures for macroregulation and control, trying to reverse the 
chaotic situation in finance through rectifying the financial 
order and strictly enforcing financial discipline so the 
national economy could revert to the road of continuous, rapid 
and healthy development. The efforts have created favorable 
conditions for smooth formulation and implementation of 
supporting financial reform measures in 1994. 
  At the press conference of the National People's Congress 
and 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on March 
17, Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of 
China, introduced the main points of financial reform in 1994. 
Major points of his introduction are as follows: 
  Establishing a central bank macroregulation and control 
system under the leadership of the State Council that will 
independently implement the monetary policies; 
  Establishing a financial organizations network in which 
policy related finance is separated from commercial finance, and 
under which state-owned commercial banks are the main body, 
while various financial institutions coexist; 
  Establishing a market system featuring openness, orderly 
competition and strict management; 
  Turning the People's Bank of China into an actual central 
bank and specialized banks into the real commercial banks; 
  Further opening up finance to the outside world, and 
unifying 
the exchange rate so the Renminbi can gradually become a 
convertible currency. 
<H5>  Macroregulation and Central Bank Control </H5>
  Since it became the central bank in 1984, the People's Bank 
of China has carried out independent monetary policies. It has 
employed international practices such as reserve deposits, 
rediscounts, interest rates, central bank loans and credit 
limits to control the money supply and adjust the credit 
structure. 
  Major function of the central bank Vice-President 
Zhou Zhengqing pointed out at the branch head conference of the 
People's Bank of China held in December last year that a real 
central bank should lead and manage national financial 
undertakings, scientifically devise and carry out monetary 
policies and maintain essential currency stability; and exert 
strict supervision and administration over financial organs and 
ensure secure and effective operation of the financial system. 
"Only the head office of the People's Bank of China has the 
right to create monetary policies," Zhou emphasized. 
  Specific Reform Measures Zhou said major reform 
measures include the following: 
  -- Transforming and defining functions of the People's Bank 
of China. The head office of the People's Bank of China has the 
rights to issue money, manage basic monetary policies, regulate 
and control total credit, and regiment bench mark interest 
rates, in order to guarantee the face of monetary policies 
throughout the country. Usually, the head office of the People's 
Bank of China only allows provision of temporary credit to head 
offices of national commercial banks. The basic duties of the 
bank's branches include: financial supervision and management 
investigation and statistical analysis, adjustment of horizontal 
money supply, state treasury operation, cash allocation, 
exchange management and interbank settlement 
  -- Reforming and improving monetary policies. The ultimate 
goal of the monetary policy of the People's Bank of China is to 
maintain currency stability and thus promote economic growth. 
In line with the macroeconomic situation, it will flexibly use 
monetary policy tools such as legal deposit reserve rates, 
central bank loans, rediscounts, interest rates, open-market 
operations, central bank foreign exchange operations and credit 
lines to regulate and control the money supply. It has started 
from this year to handle separately funds and business of 
commercial and policy-related banks, cut off the direct 
connection between the central bank's basic money supply and 
policy-related loans, and to practice asset liability ratio and 
asset risk in managing the Renminbi and foreign currency credit 
in commercial banks. 
  -- Fortifying the supervision and management of the central 
bank over the national banking industry. Drafts of the Law of 
the People's Bank of China, the Bank Law of the People's 
Republic of China, the Law of Negotiable Instruments and the Law 
of Insurance will be submitted to the National People's Congress 
for examination and approval in 1994. In the interim, rules and 
regulations managing various financial institutions will be 
drawn up and refined. According to Zhu Xiaohua, vice president 
of the People's Bank of China, China will soon make up and 
enforce 22 laws, regulations and methods relating to the banking 
industry. The drafting has absorbed some common articles from 
foreign bank laws and related regulations under the market 
economy. Starting from the reality of China, these statutes 
will be made similar to international practice so the Chinese 
financial market can be linked with global financial circles. 
<H5>  Financial lnstitutions </H5>
  Within the financial institutions network, policy-related 
finance should be separated from commercial finance. With the 
state-owned commercial banks as the main body, the network 
should accommodate financial institutions of various kinds. 
  Policy-related banks: Beginning from the second 
half of 1993, three policy-related banks were founded and 
formally put into operation in 1994. They are the State 
Development Bank that accommodates funds for key state 
construction projects; the Agricultural Development Bank that 
provides policy-related loans for the country's reserves of 
grain, cotton and edible oil, contracted purchase of farm and 
sideline products, and agricultural development; and the Bank of 
Import and Export Credit. 
  Policy-related banks are geared to the needs of state 
policies and do not aim at making profits. They provide special 
loans that are beneficial to overall stability, such as specific 
loans for infrastructure construction, stocks of key materials, 
and poverty aid and disaster relief. Their interest rates are 
much lower than those of the market. 
  Policy-related banks do not participate in commercial 
banking 
competition but receive the supervision of the central bank. 
  Conventionally, policy-related banks do not absorb social 
deposits. Therefore, they have no direct debt relationship with 
the public. The main sources of funds come from financial 
allocation, central bank reloans, bonds issued to the public, 
regular sums left in social security funds, and indirect use of 
post office deposits. 
  In establishing the policy-related banks, China has drawn on 
foreign experience as a reference, especially that of the United 
States and Japan. Still in their preliminary stages, China's 
policy-related banks are not as detailed in function as their 
foreign counterparts. 
  State-owned commercial banks: As policy-related 
banks take over policy-related financial business, the existing 
state-owned specialized banks (including the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the 
Bank of China and the People's Construction Bank of China) will 
be transformed into state-owned commercial banks. They will 
operate with the mechanisms of modern commercial banks, featured 
by autonomous management and assumption of full responsibility 
for profits and losses. 
  State-owned commercial banks, though rivals, can undertake 
interlocked business. All their operations must strictly abide 
by the Bank Law of the People's Republic of China and other 
financial rules and regulations. They must receive the 
supervision of the central bank. 
  Other financial institutions: In addition to the 
People's Bank of China and the above-mentioned four state-owned 
specialized banks, China's financial institutions include nine 
commercial banks such as the Bank of Communications, 12 
insurance companies, 387 financial trust and investment firms, 
87 securities bodies, 29 financial houses, 11 financial and 
leasing concerns, 59,000 rural credit cooperatives and 3,900 
urban credit cooperatives. All these constitute the Chinese 
financial network. 
  All commercial banks and other non-bank financial 
institutions will operate in line with the Bank Law of the 
People's Republic of China and other related financial rules and 
regulations. 
  In this financial reform, rural and urban credit 
cooperatives 
will change into rural and urban cooperative banks, whose major 
task is to develop the local economy and provide services to 
small and medium-sized enterprises and agriculture, animal 
husbandry and the fishing industry. 
<H5>  Financial Market System </H5>
  Diversification of credit forms and financial tools have 
boosted the development of China's financial market. In 1986, 
fund markets were established in the five cities of Shenyang, 
Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Changzhou. Over the following 
several years, various kinds of financial markets were 
established across the country. They included inter-bank, short 
and long-term funds, corporate bond, national debt, note 
discount, foreign exchange swap and stock markets. This 
resulted in floating interest rates and commodity capital. 
  In 1993, China successfully set up its first-class national 
debt dealer system. This symbolized the move by China's 
national debt market toward standardization and international 
practice. From this year on, the Ministry of Finance stops 
borrowing from the People's Bank to amend the financial budget, 
and therefore, the financial deficit shall be met through the 
issue of national debt. During his visit to Japan in early 
March, President Zhu Rongji said that China, in order to control 
inflation, will adopt tight currency and strict financial 
policies to control money issuing and expenditure. Specifically 
speaking, China will issue national debt to replace its previous 
practice of meeting deficit by borrowing money from banks and by 
money issue. This is a significant reform. This year, the 
proportion of national debt in the financial budget in China is 
about the same as that in Japan. 
  Another major measure in this year's financial reform is the 
unification of the exchange rate. The unitary floating exchange 
rate based on the exchange market price was put into effect from 
January 1. Coinciding with global practice, this move will have 
far-reaching significance on Sino-foreign economic exchange. It 
will help attract foreign investment and pave the way for China 
to restore its status in GATT. In addition, it opens a path for 
the free convertibility of the Renminbi, the ultimate goal of 
the reform of the exchange management system. 
  Experts say that only when China has sufficient exchange 
reserves, Chinese commodities occupy a significant share in the 
world market, Chinese enterprises are internationally 
competitive enough, and Chinese legal conditions improve, can 
the Renminbi's free convertibility finally materialize.

  [Text] Beijing, 4 Apr (XINHUA) -- The State Economic 
Restructuring Commission today convened a meeting to exchange 
experiences in coordinated reform gained by the Beijing First 
Light Industry Corporation. Speaking at the meeting, Commission 
Vice Minister Liu Zhifeng said: In light of their actual 
conditions, all localities should learn from the corporation's 
experiences and expand on them by conducting bold explorations 
and constantly making innovations. In conjunction with the 
experiment in setting up modern enterprises, the economic 
restructuring commissions of provinces and cities should 
concentrate on the experiment in conducting reform in a 
coordinated way. 
  The meeting -- in which directors of the provincial and 
autonomous regional economic restructuring commissions 
throughout the country, the leaders of the relevant central 
departments, and the principal leaders of cities directly under 
the central government participated -- was held to study ways to 
upgrade the state-owned sector of the economy, to advance reform 
of state-owned enterprises in a coordinated way, to increase the 
value of state-owned assets, to optimize the industrial 
structure, to transform the functions of government departments, 
to change the operating mechanisms of enterprises, and to train 
and distribute surplus workers and staff members so as to 
promote the establishment of a modern enterprise system. At the 
meeting, Cui Zhian, chairman of the board of directors of the 
corporation, briefed the participants on its experiences by 
delivering a report entitled "Actively Push Ahead Coordinated 
Reform To Explore New Ways for Invigorating State-Owned 
Enterprises." The meeting was presided over by Huo Guanghui, 
vice minister of the State Economic Restructuring Commission. 
Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan also spoke at the meeting. 
  Cui Zhian said: Confronted with three problems -- a shortage 
of funds, too many employees, and difficulties in taking an 
inventory of assets -- the Beijing First Light Industry 
Corporation explored many new paths in the course of deepening 
enterprise reform: It developed high-grade light industrial 
products; it shifted from developing secondary industries to 
developing tertiary industries by building the China Glass 
Center; it changed its operating mechanism by allowing a 
state-owned company to be run by private manager on a trial 
basis; it readjusted its structure by developing marketable 
products; it changed its business operations in accordance with 
the demands of a market economy. The explorations have yielded 
preliminary results, which have promoted its expansion and its 
economic performance. Last year, while a large number of 
state-owned light industrial enterprises were having 
difficulties, the corporation's output value was 2.98 billion 
yuan, up 6.8 percent over the previous year; its sales income 
was 3.49 billion yuan, up 24.2 percent over the previous year; 
it paid 236 million yuan in taxes to the state, an increase of 
16.3 percent; it made 167 million yuan in profit, up 61.7 
percent, ranking first in profit growth rate among light 
industrial enterprises in Beijing and the rest of the country. 
  Cui Zhian said: We have gained a five-point experience from 
our reform in the past year: First, to solve the deep-seated 
problems in state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to conduct 
reform in a coordinated way. Second, the nucleus of building a 
market economic system is the optimization of resource 
allocation. Third, once a reform program is drawn up, it must 
be implemented in a down-to-earth way. Fourth, good 
ideological-political work is the guarantee of coordinated 
reform. Fifth, coordinated reform must be supported in a 
coordinated way. 
  Expounding on the basic reform experience of the Beijing 
First Light Industry Corporation, Liu Zhifeng, vice minister of 
the State Economic Restructuring Commission, said: Viewed from 
the overall effort of deepening the reform of the economic 
structure, the corporation's basic reform experience has three 
outstanding features: First, in line with the requirements for 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, the 
corporation has given full play to the basic role of the market 
in allocating resources under state macroeconomic regulation and 
control. Second, it has organically integrated reform with 
development and stability. In the course of deepening reform, 
the corporation made vigorous efforts to resolve the 
contradictions brought about by the readjustment of power and 
interests, thus preserving social stability. Third, proceeding 
from the deep-seated problems in state-owned enterprises, the 
corporation carried out a systematic and coordinated reform 
while at the same time solving problems in other areas, thus 
achieving good results and pushing reform to a new level. 
  On how to learn from and apply the corporation's reform 
experiences, Liu Zhifeng said: We should thoroughly understand 
and master the corporation's basic experience and decide on a 
specific program for readjusting economic structures and 
transforming enterprises' operating mechanisms in light of the 
local conditions; we should draw up a plan and implement it step 
by step. In carrying out coordinated reform, local authorities 
should draw up a unified plan and implement it in a unified way 
under the unified leadership of city governments, and must guard 
against rushing into mass action. In authorizing the management 
of state-owned assets, it is necessary to proceed from reality 
and to separate government functions from enterprise management. 
We should do our best to innovate and transform operating 
mechanisms. We should support coordinated reform in a 
coordinated way. The principal leaders of governments and 
economic restructuring departments, as well as other relevant 
departments, should coordinate in advancing the reform.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "Fixed-Asset Funding Needs Firm Cap"] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese Government must keep a tighter lid on 
fixed assets investment to maintain stable economic growth, an 
economist said. 
  Investment in fixed assets last year shot up 50.6 percent, 
while the gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 30.6 percent. 
  An official report shows that the State fixed asset 
investment in the first quarter of this year reached 81.5 
billion yuan ($9.4 billion), up 36.2 percent from the same 
period last year. 
  However, due to governmental macro economic control, the 
growth rate of the investment actually dropped 34.5 percentage 
points in the same period, the report said. 
  The sharp investment increase last year greatly boosted the 
need for currency, which is regarded as an important factor 
pushing the nation's economy to the brink of dangerous 
overheating, said Liu Rixin, a researcher with the Economic 
Research Centre of the State Planning Commission. 
  Although 115.8 billion yuan (about $21 billion according to 
foreign exchange rate in 1992) was issued in 1992, the central 
bank last year still poured some 152.9 billion yuan ($17.5 
billion) into the market to meet urgent credit demands, which 
was the same as that issued over several years between 1985-89. 
  This inevitably led to double-digit inflation last year. 
  The central government adopted many measures early this year 
to curb the scale of investment. A circular was issued to ban 
new investment projects and the State Development Bank was 
established last month to make policy-related loan decisions. 
Inspection teams were sent nationwide last month to examine 
local investment projects. 
  Besides these moves, other important steps are required, 
according to Liu. 
  He noted that about 80 percent of fixed asset investment 
came 
from bank loans and funds raised by enterprises and local 
governments. 
  The central bank should strictly implement the State-set 
fixed assets investment plans and should not overstep these 
plans arbitrarily. 
  The National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, 
approved this year's investment plan for fixed assets of 1.3 
trillion yuan ($149 billion) at the Eighth NPC session in March, 
an increase of about 10 percent from last year. 
  Liu complained that in the past, the actual investment 
always 
exceeded the limits set by the central government. 
  The investment plan last year was set at 800 billion yuan 
($91.9 billion), while the actual investment stood at 1.18 
trillion yuan ($135.6 billion). 
  Meanwhile, Liu pointed out that the development funds raised 
by enterprises themselves must come from their profits instead 
of other financial sources. 
  However, many enterprises raised development funds by 
borrowing money from banks, issuing bonds and shares. The 
fundraising practice will eventually result in investment, he 
said. 
  He said that many enterprises and local government 
departments are eager to embrace shareholding systems or issue 
bonds for raising development funds. 
  According to macro-economic control policies, such a 
practice 
is inadvisable because it will inevitably disturb the credit 
plans of banks by soaking up too much of society's "idle" money. 
  Liu argued that "idle" money doesn't really exist in China. 
  Though many deposits are held by individuals, they have been 
taken into the credit arrangements of banks. 
  The government allows only some pilot enterprises to adopt 
the shareholding system, but some economic researchers encourage 
most enterprises to do so, according to Liu. 
  The number of listed enterprises should also be strictly 
limited at the present time. 
  Now, besides being interested in the shareholding system, 
many enterprises and local governments also aim to attract 
foreign capital. 
  But Liu said that the central government must take pertinent 
steps to guide such practice. 
  When foreign capital comes into China it should be 
supplemented by some domestic capital. 
  Before introducing foreign investment, the government should 
make some provision to guarantee domestic accessory funding for 
the projects. Otherwise, the limited domestic capital will 
restrict the introduction of foreign money. 
  Statistics show that last year, more than 10 per cent of 
fixed asset investment came from foreign capital. 
  In addition to stemming the financial source of investment, 
the central government should map out specific industrial 
policies to guide investment both from home and abroad. 
  Investors should be encouraged to pour funding into the 
country's energy and transportation sectors, its pillar 
industries and infrastructure projects. 
  Liu revealed that China improved the investment climate last 
year in the bottle-necked telecommunication and transportation 
sectors. 
  The official report said that 20 per cent of the State 
investment last year went into transportation, up 5.5 percent 
over the previous year. 
  But compared with 1992, last year's State investment in the 
energy, machinery, cultural and educational sectors dropped by 
3.3, 1.6 and 0.8 per cent respectively. 
  Market factors or prices should play an important role in 
allocating the resources, Liu pointed out. 
  With the rapid development of investment in recent years, 
the 
present investment statistics cannot reflect the actual 
conditions in the country, cautioned Liu. 
  Groups in search of investments are now diversified. They 
not only include State-owned enterprises and collectively-owned 
enterprises, but also privately-run and township firms, 
joint-ventures and foreign-invested enterprises. 
  But the current statistical methods include only the State, 
collective investment and part of the individual investment 
groups. Several groups have been excluded from the statistics. 
  He suggested the government reform the statistical methods 
to 
reflect actual practice. 
  "Complete statistics will help the government to make good 
management decisions relating to investment " he added.

"Agriculture Grows in Ethnic Areas"] 
  [Text] China's five provincial-level minority nationality 
autonomous regions (the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region, the 
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous 
Region, the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region) cover 44 percent of China's total territory. 
In addition, Qinghai, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are also 
inhabited by a large number of ethnic groups. 
  Following on the heels of a sustained growth in agricultural 
production since 1992, the eight provinces and autonomous 
regions reaped another good harvest in 1993. 
<H5>  Achievements </H5>
  The Tibet Autonomous Region, located on the "Roof of the 
World", registered a bumper harvest for the sixth successive 
year. The region's total grain output last year hit a historic 
high of 620,000 tons, quadrupling the figure for 1952 following 
the peaceful liberation of Tibet. 
  In 1993, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recorded its 
15th successive bumper harvest. The region's total grain output 
equalled the 1992 level of 7.02 million tons, even though the 
acreage planted to grain was reduced by more than 60,000 
hectares. The output of cotton reached 750,000 tons, up 7 
percent over 1992, while grape output rose to 270,000 tons, up 
20 percent. 
  In the not too distant past, the Inner Mongolian Autonomous 
Region needed to ship in 1 million tons of grain from other 
parts of the country annually. However, over the past five 
years, strengthened capital construction enabled local 
agricultural production to experience an average annual growth 
of 12 percent, thus ensuring self-sufficiency for the region's 
grain consumption. In 1993, the region reaped a total grain 
output of 11 million tons, a record high. 
  The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's grain output reached 
2.03 
million tons in 1993, an increase of 9.3 percent over 1992. 
  Guizhou Province notched an all-round increase in 
agricultural production in 1993, with total grain output hitting 
8.65 million tons, up 11.89 percent over 1992. The province 
also achieved great progress in the production of cured tobacco, 
sugarcane, tea, meat, eggs and milk. 
  Qinghai, which is located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is 
home to a large number of ethnic groups, including Mongolian, 
Tibetan, Hui and Kazakh nationalities. The province is also one 
of China's major animal husbandry bases. In 1993, despite heavy 
snowstorms which killed 13.4 million head of livestock, the 
province, thanks to the timely action of the local-government 
and masses, still set new records in the rate of slaughtered 
domestic animals, the rate of domestic animals sold as 
commodities and the output of meat, milk and hides. This 
indicates that the province has already extricated itself from 
the plight of relying on the heavens for animal husbandry 
production. 
  Summer grain output in Guangxi jumped by 6.1 percent and 
the region's total agricultural output value for last year rose 
by 9.4 percent, mirroring simultaneous increases in the 
production of grain and cash crops. 
  The development of agriculture and animal husbandry in 
ethnic 
regions has resulted in remarkable increases in the incomes of 
local farmers and herdsmen. The 1993 per-capita income for 
rural and pastoral residents in Xinjiang averaged 780 yuan, up 
5.4 percent over 1992; per-capita income for rural residents in 
Guangxi reached 860 yuan, showing a growth rate equaling the 
nation's average; per- capita income for rural and pastoral 
residents in Tibet averaged 515 yuan, up 5.1 percent over 1992; 
and the 1992 per-capita income for poverty-stricken mountainous 
areas in south Ningxia registered a 200 percent increase over 
1982. 
<H5>  Reasons for Development </H5>
  The successive years of bumper harvests in China's ethnic 
areas should be attributed to local government concerted efforts 
to place priority on agriculture and animal husbandry and their 
introduction of a series of effective measures. 
  Increased capital input. Yunnan Province, where a 
large number of China's minority nationalities live in compact 
communities, has for many years led the country in agricultural 
capital inputs. In 1992, funds invested in agriculture reached 
2.64 billion yuan, or 21.7 percent of the province's total 
annual expenditures. In 1993, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region 
allocated 21 million yuan to the project to realign the Yellow 
River irrigation network. Over the past five years, the Inner 
Mongolian Autonomous Region has invested 2.04 billion yuan in 
capital construction for agriculture and animal husbandry, an 
increase of 81.4 percent over the previous five-year period. 
  Expanding capital construction. Over the past 
three years, Guizhou as transformed 80,000 hectares of low and 
medium-yield land, and set up a group of forestry centers and 
animal husbandry bases which have provided strong support for 
the all-round development of agriculture. Last year, completion 
of the first phase of the comprehensive development project on 
the Great Bend of the Yellow River helped to increase local 
irrigated areas in Ningxia by 5,000 hectares and improved over 
70,000 hectares of irrigated land. Inner Mongolia has achieved 
remarkable progress in establishing grazing lands and commodity 
grain bases. And, by the end of 1993, the region had completed 
the construction of 247 agricultural development projects and 
commodity grain bases. Over the past two years, the Tibet 
Autonomous Region has transformed 3,200 hectares of low and 
medium-yield land, afforested 1,000 hectares, and expanded and 
improved more than 4,000 hectares of irrigated land in the 
Painbo and Namling agricultural development areas. 
  Popularizing science and technology. As part of 
an effort to transform traditional farming into a modern 
agriculture, local governments in minority regions have offered 
practical technical education to local farmers and herdsmen. 
The effort has helped train a large number of qualified 
agrotechnicians and establish a widespread science and 
technology promotion network in each locality. Beginning in 
1992, some 500,000 farmers in Guangxi studied from one to two 
applied technologies each year, with 5,000 being selected for 
further education. While establishing a four- layer technology 
promotion network covering the region and all counties, 
townships and villages, Ningxia provided 650,000 farmers with 
training, helping them master two to three applied technologies. 
Xinjiang has also recorded remarkable progress in training 
agrotechnicians and, by the end of 1992, some 14,000 farmers and 
herdsmen had been awarded certificates as agrotechnicians. They 
have played an important role in the application and 
popularization of advanced techniques. 
  Since 1988, in accordance with conditions, Tibet, a vast 
sparsely populated and undeveloped area, has devoted great 
effort to promote the Harvest Program which stresses the use of 
various agricultural technologies for yielding bumper harvests. 
By the end of 1993, some 682 projects covering 4.8 million 
hectares had been established according to plan. In addition, 
scientific and technological demonstration and popularization 
plans had been implemented in over half of the region's 
counties. These counties, which embrace all the ecological 
areas in the region, make up two-thirds of the region's 
agricultural and combined agricultural and pastoral counties and 
cover more than 80 percent of the region's total cultivated 
land. They have experienced the most rapid agricultural 
development and the largest percentage increase in grain 
production.

  [Text] Canberra, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Stephen Martin, speaker 
of the House of Representatives of Australia, said this evening 
that the mutual visits between parliamentarians of Australia and 
China are conducive to the increase of understanding. 
  This would also contribute to the further development of 
relations between the two countries, Martin said. 
  Martin made the remarks at a dinner entertained in honor of 
visiting vice-chairman Tian Jiyun of the Chinese National 
People's Congress (NPC), who is now leading a NPC delegation on 
a week-long visit to the South Pacific nation. 
  The speaker stressed that both Australia and China as well 
parliaments of the two countries have enjoyed close and friendly 
relationship. 
  Tian said that although China and Australia have different 
social system, ideology, view of value and development stage of 
economy, the two countries have shared common interests in many 
areas. 
  The two countries, situated in the Asia-Pacific region, have 
common interests in safeguarding peace and stability in the 
region, developing economy of their own nation, booming economy 
in the region and improving the living standard of their own 
people, Tian stressed. 
  He said that "the rapid economic development in China will 
certainly create new opportunities for our bilateral economic 
and trade cooperation." 
  The two-way trade between China and Australia reached three 
billion U.S. dollars in 1993, representing an increase of 28 
percent compared with the previous year, and is expected to 
increase this year. 
  He also disclosed that in the coming seven years, China is 
going to import commodities worth of 1,000 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Tian said that the economies of the two countries have 
strong 
compliments and the potential is great for furthering the 
bilateral cooperation. 
  He hoped that the trade volume between the two countries 
would have considerable share in the total sum of 1,000 billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  Tian and the delegation he led arrived in Canberra this 
afternoon. On his way from Sydney to Canberra, Tian had a 
stop-over in Wollongong, south of Sydney, where he visited the 
Port Kembla grain terminal.

  [Text] Canberra, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Bill Hayden, 
governor-general of Australia, said here today that he was 
deeply impressed by the great achievements that China has scored 
in its drive of opening to the outside world and economic 
reforms. 
  Hayden said this in a meeting with visiting vice-chairman 
Tian Jiyun of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), who 
is leading a NPC delegation on a visit to the South Pacific 
nation. 
  Hayden said that he hoped China would continue to cooperate 
with Australia in the fields of agriculture and husbandry and 
increase its trade volume in agricultural produces. 
  The Australian governor-general just returned back from his 
nine-day official visit to China, where he had meetings with 
President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders. 
  Tian, expressing his appreciation for the contributions 
Hayden has made to the Sino-Aussie friendship, said that Hayden 
is an old friend of the Chinese people. 
  Tian said that both China and Australia are big countries in 
the Asia-Pacific region and can play an important role in 
development and in safeguarding peace and stability in the 
region. 
  He also said that the potential for cooperation is great 
between the two countries as China is a large nation with over a 
billion population and Australia is a large country boasting 
rich resources. 
  Tian said that the deepening of China's reforms would offer 
opportunities for further increasing bilateral trade. 
  Tian also conveyed regards from Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin 
to Hayden, who asked Tian to convey his best wish to Jiang. 
  Tian arrived in Australia on Tuesday [3 May] for a week-long 
visit to the country, the last leg of his four-nation 
South-Pacific trip, which has already taken him to New Zealand, 
Western Samoa and Papua New Guinea. 
  In the morning today, Tian also had meetings with Rick 
Farley, executive director of the National Farmers' Federation, 
Andrew Peacock, shadow minister for foreign affairs of the 
opposition, and Tim Fisher of the leader of the National Party.

  [Text] Kunming, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The Yingjiang-Bhamo 
highway, a new highway across the Sino-Myanmar [Burma] border 
area, opened to traffic late last month. 
  The 128-kilometer highway runs from Yingjiang County in 
southwest China's Yunnan Province to Bhamo city in the northern 
frontier region of Myanmar. 
  The construction of the highway started in November 1991. It 
connects the noted Yunnan-Myanmar highway in Yunnan Province and 
links up with the Stilwell Highway in Myanmar (the Stilwell 
Highway was named after Joseph Stilwell, a late U.S. general). 
The section of the highway in Myanmar's territory is 56 
kilometers. With the approval of the Myanmar government, 
Chinese road builders joined in the construction of a 
28.8-kilometer part of the highway on the Myanmar side. 
  The highway is built along the ancient commercial path which 
stretched from Yunnan to Myanmar, India and Pakistan. 
  Sources said that the opening of the highway will promote 
the 
development of border trade between China and Myanmar and will 
serve as a short cut for trade between China and Southeast Asian 
and southern Asian countries.

  [Text] Cairo, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Palestinian leader Yasir 
'Arafat wrote down his reservations on the maps annex before he 
signed it at the ceremony for the signing of the Gaza-Jericho 
self-rule agreement with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
here today. 
  During the ceremony 'Arafat first signed three copies of the 
agreement, but refused to sign the annexes of the maps of Gaza 
and Jericho that will become autonomous zones. 
  Then Rabin signed the agreement without signing the annexes 
either, which led to a brief recess of the ceremony for last 
minute consultations. 
  They returned to the hall a few minutes later. 'Arafat then 
wrote down his reservations in arabic and signed the annexes. 
  Informed sources told XINHUA the words he wrote in Arabic 
were "these maps are not final and they are still under 
consideration." 
  Rabin listened to 'Arafat's reservations through an 
interpreter and then signed the annexes without making any 
statement. 
  Israel agreed to give 62 square kilometers to Jericho but 
Palestinians demanded more than double. 
  Chief PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'ath said after the ceremony 
that the size of Jericho will be further negotiated.

  [Text] Cairo, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak described the new PLO-Israeli agreement on Palestinian 
autonomy in Gaza and Jericho signed here today as a 
"revolutionary transformation" in relations between Israel and 
the Palestinians. 
  The agreement, signed by Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat 
and 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, deals with details of the 
implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and 
the West Bank's Jericho area, including the Israeli troops 
withdrawal and the establishment of Palestinian autonomy 
authority in the two areas. 
  Palestinian autonomy in the two areas was provided for in 
the 
PLO-Israeli peace accord signed in Washington on last September 
13. 
  Speaking at today's signing ceremony, Mubarak said, "we have 
witnessed a historic event which will have its effect on the 
future and destiny of the area for hundred years to come." 
  "This event is a landmark on the road of realizing a great 
dream and a unique vision of the makers of peace whose faith has 
not been shaken, in spite of difficult circumstances, for the 
sake of peace and its sublime aim and noble goal," he added. 
  Hence, he said, the moment of the signing of the new 
agreement was a historic moment that will not be obliterated by 
the passage of time. 
  Mubarak also reviewed the difficult and strenuous efforts of 
many parties for Palestinian-Israeli peace. 
  He said peace is the ultimate goal of all peoples and war is 
a meaningless endeavor regardless of any tentative victory or 
illusionary security. "It is the just and honorable peace alone 
that represents the right path to a life of security and 
happiness." 
  He said, "the Egyptian people have never hesitated for a 
moment to sacrifice their souls, daily bread and blood for the 
sake of a just and comprehensive peace to be enjoyed by all the 
peoples in the area." 
  He stressed, "any unilateral peace between Egypt and Israel 
or between any country of the confrontation countries with 
Israel will not establish permanent and just peace in the entire 
area. More than that, even if peace is realized between all 
confrontation countries and Israel without a just solution to 
the Palestine problem, this will never establish durable and 
just peace on which the entire world insists today." 
  He said, "despite the fact that we still have ahead of us 
several steps to establish a comprehensive peace to which we are 
committed, the step which has just been realized and the 
achievement we have just reached are important enough as they 
lead to further steps along the path of peace." 
  He also urged people to implement the new agreement "in the 
spirit of goodwill and in all honesty despite all difficulties 
that may arise in the process of implementation, difficulties 
which we consider are part of the nature."

  [Text] Cairo, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The agreement signed by the 
PLO and Israel here today on implementing Palestinian self-rule 
includes a general accord and four annexes. 
  The annexes are on security, economy, legal jurisdiction and 
transfer of civil power. The annex on economy, that is part of 
the self-rule agreement, was already signed by the PLO and 
Israel at the end of last month in Paris, where negotiations 
thereon were held. 
  The main points of the agreement including the 
following: 

  -  Israel and the PLO, the representative of the 
Palestinian people, reaffirm their determination to live in 
peaceful coexistence, mutual dignity and security while 
recognizing their mutual legitimate and political rights. 
  -  The 
two sides reaffirm their desire to achieve a just, lasting and 
comprehensive peace settlement through the agreed political 
process and reaffirm their adherence to the mutual 
recognition. 
  -  The two sides reaffirm their understanding that the 
interim self government arrangements in the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho area are an integral part of the whole peace process and 
that the negotiations on the permanent status will lead to the 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242 and 
338. 
  -  Israel shall implement an accelerated and scheduled 
withdrawal of Israeli military forces from the Gaza Strip and 
from the Jericho area beginning immediately with signing of this 
agreement and to be completed within three weeks from this 
date. 
  -  Israel will be responsible for external security and for 
internal security in areas of Jewish settlements. 
  -  The 
Palestinian authority shall establish a strong police force in 
order to guarantee public order and internal security for the 
Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho. 
  -  Israel and the Palestinian 
authority shall seek to foster mutual understanding and 
tolerance and abstain from incitement, including hostile 
propaganda against each other. 
  -  Both sides shall take all 
measures necessary in order to prevent acts of terrorism, crimes 
and hostilities directed against each other. 
  -  The parties agree 
to a temporary international or foreign presence in the 
territory, including international observers and instructors. 
  -  If 
the Palestinian authority is unable to prevent attacks against 
Israeli settlements or Israelis so that their security is 
threatened, Israel may take all measures necessary to respond to 
such events including the introduction of additional military 
forces.

  [Text] Cairo, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The Palestinians and the 
Israelis have agreed on jurisdiction affairs in the Gaza Strip 
and the West Bank's Jericho area where Palestinians will 
implement self-rule in accordance with an agreement they signed 
today. 
  Under a jurisdiction annex of the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement on Palestinian self-rule, the power of the Palestinian 
autonomy authority covers all matters that fall within its 
territorial, functional and personal jurisdiction. 
  The annex says the territorial jurisdiction, which covers 
the 
Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, shall include land, subsoil and 
territorial waters. 
  The functional jurisdiction does not include foreign 
relations, internal security and public order of Israeli 
settlements and the military installation area and Israelis, and 
external security. 
  The personal jurisdiction extends to all persons within the 
territorial jurisdiction, except for Israelis. 
  The Palestinian authority has legislative, executive and 
judicial powers and responsibilities, while Israel has autority 
over the Israeli settlements, the military installation area, 
and Israelis. 
  The annex also specifies criminal and civil jurisdiction. 
  Two other annexes, one on israeli troops withdrawal and the 
other on civil matters, were also signed along with the 
jurisdiction annex. They are part of the Palestinian autonomy 
agreement. 
  Israeli troops will complete their withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho within three weeks. 
  An annex on economic affairs was already signed at the end 
of 
last month in Paris. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel signed a 
peace accord in Washington on last September 13, which provides 
for Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. But, the 
implementation of the accord was delayed because of differences 
between the two sides on some key issues.

<F P=106> [XINHUA "Feature": "Jericho Embraces Belated Happiness of </F>
Autonomy With Low-Key Celebrations"] 
  [Text] Jerusalem, May 4 (XINHUA) -- "We are very happy 
today that the agreement on Gaza-Jericho self-rule finally 
comes, though it has been delayed for so long," said Mahmoud 
Sutari, who works for PLO's press office branch in Jericho, an 
ancient West Bank city. 
  Sutari is only one of over ten thousand Palestinian 
residents 
in West Bank town of Jericho who expressed their excitement over 
the signing of the self-rule agreement by PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo. 
  Under the Israeli-PLO Peace Accord signed in Washington last 
September, the Israeli troops withdrawal should have started on 
December 13 last year and been completed by April 13. But both 
deadlines were missed because of differences between the two 
sides on some key issues. 
  There was no scene of large celebrations, largely due to the 
delay of the agreement, but still people of all ages were 
rushing to the narrow streets, laughing and chanting. Though 
traffic jams occurred sometimes, no one complained as usual. 
  So far, a lot of Palestinian flags were already flying on 
various buildings, reminding people that Jericho is now a place 
of the Palestinians. 
  Two young Palestinians even climbed to the top of the iron 
fences surrounding the Israeli police office in the town center 
to erect the Palestinian flags. Though the Israeli police are 
still in the building, they showed great restrictions and did 
not take any action to stop the Palestinians. 
  "Today the world understands that after 27 years, we're 
feeling much better, though the happiness is a little bit late," 
Sutari said. He is referring to the year 1967 when Israel used 
only six hours to seize the West Bank of the Jordan River. 
  Helal al-Takrorg, 23, and Monir Tanboupi, 26, both 
university 
students from the biggest West Bank town Nablus, told XINHUA 
that "they feel great" toward the upcoming autonomy. 
  There was no photo of 'Arafat in the town center, except a 
few drawings of him on dirty walls. 'Arafat declared in April 
that he would come to Jericho this month. 
  "I trust Mr. Arafat, trust everything he does very much, 
because he is a hero of all Palestinians," said Takrorg. 
  When asked whether they believe 'Arafat would bring them 
together to build a strong economy, both Takrorg and Tanboupi 
gave a positive answer. "A strong economy will not come at 
present, but maybe at future," Takrorg said. 
  Imad Bevahmeh, owner of a small shop, told XINHUA that he 
"is 
overwhelmed by today's signing." "I admire 'Arafat very much 
because he will bring democracy and a new life to our people," 
he said. 
  But not all the Palestinians would like to render their 
support to 'Arafat. A young Palestinian, who would only called 
himself Mohamed, described 'Arafat as a "weak" man because he 
conceded a lot to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin and because he 
could not really bring together Hamas, Fatah and other 
Palestinian parties. 
  The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, and PLO's mainstream 
Fatah movement, under heavy pressure from the Israeli 
Government, reached a cooperation accord after difficult 
negotiations on April 22, to pave the way for today's signing of 
the agreement. 
  Hamas promised to suspend attack on the Palestinians it 
considers collaborating with Israel for one month after the 
implementation of the self-rule agreement, but declared it would 
continue to take violent actions against Israelis. 
  Mohamed continued to say that "the economy will be a pretty 
hard task for 'Arafat" because in Jericho there is only 
agriculture with industry next to zero. 
  Not all the faces we saw were joyous. The scene turned to be 
full of anger when a middle-aged woman cried loudly in the face 
of the Israeli police office building: "Why did you kill my son? 
Was he guilty?" Her son, though not involved in violence, was 
killed by Israeli police just two months ago. 
  Whether peace and harmony will really come between the 
Israelis and the Palestinians remains a big question, because 
opposition forces on both sides are still quite strong. 
  Sutari said, "we are not hitting Jews, we are just looking 
for freedom of our own state. The problem (of possible 
violence) does not come from the people, but from the political 
sides." 
  When asked about their future, shop owner Bevahmeh said, "my 
business will do better, because with autonomy we will have more 
chances and opportunities. Life will get better, and more 
customers will come to my shop." 
  "Now we are looking for a better life. There will be a new 
government, our own leaders, and our own life," Sutari told 
XINHUA.

  [Text] Islamabad, April 30 (XINHUA) -- President Farooq 
Leghari today highly praised the Chinese experts working in 
Saindak project for their efforts to complete the project six 
months ahead of schedule. 
  Leghari, who visited the project near Pak-Iran border in 
Balochistan province today, said that the Saindak project would 
help further cement the already friendly ties between Pakistan 
and China. 
  He said the completion of the Saindak project would usher in 
new era of prosperity and progress in Balochistan province. 
  The project, under construction of Chinese engineers, is 
expected to yield for 19 years an average annual production of 
15,810 tons of copper, 1.47 tons of gold and 2.76 tons of silver. 
  The products will be exported to China, Japan and the United 
Kingdom and other European countries at international prices. 
  The project will also result in creating 1,288 direct and 
11,000 indirect jobs, mostly for people of Balochistan. 
  Saindak is about 700 kilometres from Quetta, capital of 
Balochistan province. 
  Saindak project, one of the biggest project in the mineral 
sector in Pakistan, would be completed in February 1995, six 
months ahead of the schedule, resulting in savings of about 30 
million U.S. dollars in the project cost.

<F P=106> [By Zhao Changchun (6392 7022 2504)] </F>
  [Text] Helsinki, 3 May (XINHUA) -- On 3 May, Finnish Prime 
Minister Esko Aho met with Li Ruihuan, visiting chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference. The two leaders praised Sino-Finnish 
friendship in glowing terms, exchanging views on further 
developing friendly relations and cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Li Ruihuan said: The Chinese and Finnish peoples enjoy a 
traditional friendship. Despite changes that have taken place 
in the world for an extended period of time since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Finland, 
relations between the two countries have always been very good 
and can be described as a model of friendly relations and 
cooperation between countries with different social systems. 
China is satisfied with the smooth development of its relations 
with Finland, and appreciates the farsighted China policy 
implemented by the Finnish Government. 
  Li Ruihuan said: The sound development of Sino-Finnish 
relations has primarily arisen from mutual respect shown by the 
two countries for each other's reality and national conditions, 
and for the wishes and political choice of each other's people. 
Second, it has stemmed from frequent exchanges, especially 
constant exchanges of high-level visits aimed at enhancing 
understanding and dispelling misunderstandings. Third, it has 
arisen from common development based on equality and 
reciprocity. Fourth, it has been brought about by consultation 
aimed at seeking common ground while reserving differences. 
  Li Ruihuan said: China is a developing country engaged in 
reform and opening up, whereas Finland is a developed 
industrialized nation. There is tremendous potential for 
cooperation because both have their own strengths and can 
complement each other. China is ready to raise the relations 
between the two countries to a new level on the current basis. 
  Prime Minister Aho said his recent visit to China had been a 
great success. He said: Finland and China have successfully 
developed their friendly relations and cooperation in all fields 
since they established diplomatic relations. Particularly in 
recent years, they have made great strides in economic, trade, 
scientific, and technological cooperation. Through constant 
exchanges of high- level visits in the political arena, the two 
sides have found common ground and reached understanding on many 
issues. Finland is satisfied with the development of its 
relations with China. He said: The Finnish Government attaches 
great importance to Chairman Li Ruihuan's current visit, viewing 
it as a new effort at developing relations between the two 
countries. He expressed the belief that Li Ruihuan's visit 
would further the continuous development of mutually beneficial 
cooperation between the two countries. Prime Minister Aho asked 
Li Ruihuan to convey his regards to Premier Li Peng.

  [Text] Helsinki, 3 May (XINHUA) -- Finnish Foreign Minister 
Haavisto held talks on 3 May with Li Ruihuan, chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] who is visiting Finland. The 
two sides pledged concerted efforts to further promote bilateral 
relations. 
  Li Ruihuan said: In recent years, China and Finland have 
made 
remarkable achievements in exchanges and cooperation in all 
fields. The leaders of the two countries exchange visits 
constantly. Bilateral economic relations and trade have 
developed rapidly. New success has been made in scientific and 
technological cooperation. Cultural and educational exchanges 
have also been very active. China is satisfied and gratified 
with the smooth development of Sino-Finnish relations. 
  On China's foreign policy, Li Ruihuan said: China pursues a 
policy characterized by independence and self-reliance with 
peace and development as its goals. To put it more 
specifically, it is a policy to safeguard China's independence 
and sovereignty, oppose external intervention, stand for 
peaceful settlement of international disputes, oppose hegemony 
and power politics of any form, establish friendly relations and 
cooperation with all countries, including western nations, on 
the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, 
actively develop good-neighborly and friendly relations with 
neighboring countries, strengthen solidarity and cooperation 
with developing nations, and open our door on every side. 
  Haavisto said: China's great success in economic 
construction 
has won respect and admiration from the people of the world. 
Finland hopes to further cooperate with China in various fields 
and take an active part in China's economic construction. 
Chairman Li's current visit to Finland will deepen China's 
understanding of Finland, promote friendship between the two 
peoples, and bring about a sustained and stable development of 
bilateral economic and trade relations on the basis of equality 
and mutual benefit. 
  In the evening, Haavisto gave a banquet in honor of Li 
Ruihuan and his party.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (CNS) -- Governor of Anhui Mr. Fu 
Xishou met the British ambassador to China Sir Robin McLaren 
this afternoon and briefed him on economic development in the 
province. 
  Mr. Fu told the British ambassador that reform and opening 
to 
the outside world had brought great development to the province. 
Anhui has in recent years seen a greater economic and social 
development. The gross national product (GDP) achieved in the 
province grew by 17 percent in 1992. Economic exploitation in 
Anhui went ahead at a rapid pace in 1993 and the GDP rose by 22 
percent over the year before, ranking the province one of the 
leading provinces in the country. He said that Anhui possessed 
the conditions for economic development despite its geographical 
location in the hinterland. 
  When asked by Sir Robin whether poverty still remained in 
the 
province, Mr. Fu frankly said that many rural areas within the 
province had seen their living standard improved but some remote 
mountain areas had not yet eliminated poverty and this involved 
a population of nearly three million. Mr. Fu added that various 
local governments were adopting measures to reverse the 
backwardness in these areas. 
  The governor asked for overseas investment for better 
exploitation in the province. He said that negotiations on 26 
possible items for joint ventures was recently held with six of 
them officially confirmed involving an investment value of up to 
U.S.$100 million.

<F P=106> ["Resolution of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Anhui </F>
Discipline Inspection Commission"] 
  [Text] The ninth plenary session of the Anhui Discipline 
Inspection Commission was held in Hefei from 21 to 23 March. 
Twenty-five discipline inspection commission members attended 
the meeting. Attending as observers were persons in charge of 
the discipline inspection organs of various localities, cities, 
counties (districts), units directly under the province, 
universities, and large-sized enterprises and institutions. The 
plenary session, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line, revolved around the party's tasks of 
seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability; conveyed the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection; reviewed and summed up 
anticorruption fight across Anhui since 1993, especially the 
second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection; exchanged the experience in anticorruption fight; 
and made arrangements for anticorruption tasks in 1994. 
  The plenary session deliberated and approved a report 
"Launching the Deep-Going Anticorruption Fight So As To Serve 
Anhui's Reform, Development, and Stability" by Chen Guanglin, 
secretary of the Anhui Discipline Inspection Commission, on 
behalf of the Anhui Discipline Inspection Commission Standing 
Committee. Lu Rongjing, secretary of the Anhui Provincial CPC 
Commission, delivered an important speech at the meeting. The 
session held that comrade Lu Rongjing's speech and Comrade Chen 
Guanglin's report earnestly implemented the guidelines of the 
Third Plenary Session of the Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection; analyzed Anhui's anticorruption fight in a 
seeking-truth-from-facts manner; summed up the experience of 
anticorruption fight in 1993; and clearly defined the tasks of 
the anticorruption fight in 1994. The session called on party 
organizations at all levels across Anhui to earnestly organize 
the broad ranks of party members and cadres to study the 
guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission and the Ninth Plenary Session 
of the Anhui Discipline Inspection Commission; to further reach 
a unity of thinking and understanding; to meet the demands of 
the central authorities and the provincial party committee; to 
strengthen flesh-and-blood ties with the masses of the people; 
to adopt effective measures; and continue to carry out the 
deep-going anticorruption fight. 
  Last year was a year witnessing rapid progress in reform, 
opening up, and economic development in Anhui, as well as major 
breakthroughs in the anticorruption fight. Party organizations, 
governments, and discipline inspection organs at all levels 
across Anhui firmly carried out the party's basic line; and, 
based on the arrangements of the central authorities and the 
Anhui provincial party committee, closely revolved around the 
pivotal task of economic development, led the broad ranks of 
party members, cadres, and the people to launch a broad and 
deep-going anticorruption fight, and accomplished many tasks. 
Generally speaking, the anticorruption fight across Anhui was 
good and its development was healthy. To a varying extent, we 
scored some results in carrying out the three tasks put forward 
by the central authorities and basically met the demands of the 
central authorities and the Anhui provincial party committee. 
Remarkable results were scored in areas and departments where 
good work was done. All of these made positive contributions to 
maintaining political stability, promoting reform, opening up, 
and economic development in Anhui, as well as ensuring the 
implementation of the macroeconomic regulation and control in 
Anhui. The session held that we should fully affirm the 
progress and results achieved in the anticorruption fight at an 
earlier stage; however, we must address the issue of the 
unbalanced progress of Anhui's anticorruption fight. Some 
results are not solid, and some deep-rooted problems have yet to 
be resolved. We still face a grim situation in the 
anticorruption fight. This is a very formidable task that needs 
persistent arduous efforts and allows no laxity. 
  In last year's anticorruption fight, various localities and 
departments thoroughly implemented the central authorities' 
arrangements, policies, and principles regarding the launching 
of the anticorruption fight and accumulated a great deal of 
experience. These experiences are mainly as follows: 1) to 
accord with the tasks of the central authorities and the Anhui 
provincial party committee, closely integrate reform, opening 
up, and economic development with the anticorruption fight, and 
ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the Anhui 
economy; 2) to adhere to the principle of "firmly grasping two 
links at the same time" and truly take the responsibility of 
leading the anticorruption fight; 3) to fully mobilize the 
masses and rely on them to fight corruption; 4) to attach 
importance to doing a good job at every stage and concentrate 
efforts on management over special projects; 5) to strengthen 
leadership over investigation and handling of cases and make 
efforts toward solving major cases; and 6) to give full play to 
responsible institutions' functions and form joint forces to 
fight corruption. These experiences should be applied to guide 
the future anticorruption fight and improved in practice. 
  The session pointed out: In accordance with the 
arrangements of the central authorities and the Anhui provincial 
party committee, the general requirement of this year's 
anticorruption fight is to adhere to taking Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line as guidance; to 
thoroughly implement guidelines of the third plenary session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Third Plenary Session of the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission, and the 10th Plenary 
Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial CPC Committee in an 
all-round manner; to grasp the party's tasks; to closely revolve 
around the pivotal task of economic development; to adhere to 
the three anticorruption tasks; and, on the basis of 
consolidating achieved results, to continue to carry out 
effectively the deep-going and protracted anticorruption fight; 
and to serve Anhui's reform, development, and stability. 
  First, we should continue to exercise strict supervision 
over 
leading cadres' honesty and discipline. Leading cadres of party 
and government organs at and above the county (section) level 
should strictly implement various regulations of the central 
authorities and the State Council regarding the strengthening of 
the construction of party work style and a clean government. We 
should continue to thoroughly implement the five-article 
regulations on honesty and discipline put forward by the central 
authorities last year. On this basis, we should firmly 
implement the five-article regulations put forward and 
reiterated by the central authorities this year: 
  (1) It is not allowed to violate regulations to purchase and 
replace imported luxury cars; it is not allowed to abuse one's 
authority to change or borrow cars and extort funds for car 
buying from enterprises and subordinate units; it is not allowed 
to use loans, pooled funds, and funds for special projects to 
purchase cars for leading cadres. County (city) party and 
government organs and units that have not paid back workers' 
wages are not allowed to purchase cars. (2) It is not allowed 
to violate the State Council's regulations on the reform of the 
housing system to purchase homes at lower prices; it is not 
allowed to abuse one's authority to offer preferential 
conditions when purchasing homes for oneself, one's children, 
and relatives; it is not allowed to spend public funds on 
refurbishing individual's homes. (3) On their domestic official 
business trips, leading cadres should travel with light luggage 
and few attendants and should not go beyond the local standards 
for room and board. It is not allowed to host special dance 
parties for leading cadres. (4) It is not allowed to turn 
events into big extravaganzas, in the name of weddings, 
funerals, post transfers, birthdays, or house-warming. It is, 
especially, not allowed to spend public funds and property on 
hosting such events and to take the opportunity to accumulate 
wealth. (5) It is not allowed to abuse one's authority to delay 
paying back public funds; it is not allowed to borrow public 
funds for purchasing homes for oneself and one's relatives and 
friends, to build private houses, and engage in profit-earning 
activities. 
  In accordance with the guidelines of the central 
authorities' 
regulations, we should, in the light of Anhui's reality, include 
the correcting of party and government organs that violate 
regulations to spend public funds on installing telephones in 
their homes into the contents on cadres' honesty and discipline; 
and implement this together with the central authorities' 
five-article regulations. Leading cadres of enterprises and 
institutions and those of party and government organs at and 
above county (section) level also should implement the 
regulations on honesty and discipline; oppose such corrupt 
phenomena as abusing power for personal gain, embezzlement, 
taking bribes, and extravagance. 
  Second, we should continue to do a good job in investigating 
and handling major cases. We should focus on the investigation 
and handling of law- and discipline-violating cases of leading 
party and government organs and cadres, judicial departments, 
administrative law-enforcement departments, economic 
administrative departments, and their staff members; and 
concentrate our efforts on the investigation and handling of 
major cases. We should emphasize the investigation and handling 
of cases that involve leading cadres embezzling funds, taking 
bribes, and abusing power for personal gain; cases that involve 
law- and discipline-enforcement personnel practicing favoritism 
and engaging in malpractice, perverting justice for bribes, 
violating the law when enforcing laws, and violating discipline 
when enforcing discipline; and cases that involve legal bodies 
violating the law and discipline. We should select typical 
cases to make public to the masses and improve the social 
effects of the handling of cases. 
  Third, we must continue to stop unhealthy tendencies. (1) 
We must continue to firmly stop unwarranted levies, and place 
emphasis on intensifying supervision and inspection, making sure 
that rules are strictly followed. Efforts must be made to deal 
with noncompensatory use of enterprises' vehicles, computers, 
and telecommunications equipment by party and government organs, 
or their personnel, through abusing their authority; as well as 
the problem involving the use of various names to appropriate 
enterprises' funds for creating "small coffers" for organs, or 
using appropriated funds for projects benefiting staff workers. 
The unhealthy tendency of soliciting financial support from 
enterprises under all sorts of excuses must stop. Efforts to 
alleviate peasants' burdens must continue. The central 
government's regulations on separating the collection and use of 
administrative levies and fines must be firmly followed, and 
specific measures must be drawn up for implementing these 
regulations. (2) The "small coffers" of party and government 
organs, administrative organs, and institutions must be 
screened. (3) Continual efforts must be made to stop the 
unhealthy trend of using public funds for travelling abroad or 
in other parts of the country. 
  To safeguard the solemnity of political discipline and 
ensure 
the implementation of government orders, discipline inspection 
and supervisory organs at all levels must, while carrying out 
these three anticorruption projects, intensify their supervision 
over law enforcement and the implementation of democratic 
centralism, focusing attention on the implementation of all 
major decisions and measures of the party Central Committee, the 
State Council, the provincial party committee, and the 
provincial government on deepening reforms, developing the 
economy, and maintaining stability. 
  This year is an important year for implementing the 
guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress, the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the 
10th Plenary Session of the Fifth Anhui Provincial Party 
Committee; an important year for Anhui to achieve a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development; and an important year 
for restructuring the economic system. While reform, 
development, and stability are arduous tasks, so is the 
anticorruption struggle. The plenary session urges all party 
committees and governments to properly handle the relations 
between reform, development, stability, and the anticorruption 
struggle; firmly uphold the policy of promoting material 
civilization and socialist ethics at the same time; and regard 
the anticorruption struggle as part of the scheme of overall 
importance. We must mobilize all party members to wage the 
fight, party organs and government departments must join forces, 
and each and every organ and department has to responsibilities 
to fulfill. The fight against corruption must be closely 
coordinated with efforts to improve party conduct and work 
ethics, party members and cadres must be regularly educated to 
be mindful of their conduct and work ethics, rules and 
regulations governing party conduct should be drawn up, and the 
work ethics-related legislation must be expedited, so that the 
root causes and the symptoms can be dealt with at the same time. 
Party and government leaders at all levels must set examples 
with their personal deeds. They must take the lead in 
implementing the Central Committee's regulations and 
requirements for fighting corruption and promoting work ethics, 
earnestly intensify supervision over the anticorruption 
struggle, and render assistance in doing away with interference 
and in dealing with thorny problems. Anticorruption propaganda 
must be further intensified and a good environment for the media 
to join in the fight against corruption should be created. 
  To keep pace with the anticorruption drive, discipline 
inspection and supervisory organs must be even stronger. As 
advisors and important assistants to party committees and 
governments in improving party conduct and work ethics, 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs play the role of 
organizing, coordinating, and guiding the struggle. Cadres, 
especially leading cadres, of all discipline inspection and 
supervisory organs must earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, study 
the unabridged version in the light of the actual state of 
affairs, and use the guidelines to guide their work. Leading 
bodies of all discipline inspection commissions must abide by 
the party principle for democratic centralism, exercise 
collective leadership and share responsibilities, work with 
greater unity and coordination, and do their jobs with concerted 
efforts. We must sum up experiences of improving efficiency by 
merging offices, and continue to streamline our organization, 
organs, operations, and operating procedures so that each organ 
will have two different functions. All organs must intensify 
their ideological and operational construction. They must 
educate their cadres to uphold the concept of taking overall 
interests into account and guide their cadres to study the 
market economy so that they can do their jobs more efficiently. 
Organs must also intensify investigation and study and do their 
jobs creatively. 
  The plenary session believes that, as long as party 
committees and governments at all levels firmly implement the 
decisions of the Central Committee and the provincial party 
committee on fighting corruption, have a consensus of view, 
earnestly strengthen leadership, fully mobilize the masses to 
follow through with the project, this year's anticorruption 
drive certainly will achieve new success.

<F P=106> ["Resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Jiangsu </F>
Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission (adopted on 16 
March 1994)"] 
  [Text] The Eighth Plenary Session of the Jiangsu 
Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission was held in 
Nanjing 15-16 March 1994. Thirty-three members of the 
commission attended the session. The secretaries of various city 
discipline inspection commissions, the directors of various city 
supervisory bureaus, and the responsible persons of various 
departments of provincial-level organs, of various units 
directly under the provincial government, and of the discipline 
inspection and supervisory organizations under the party groups 
(party organizations) of schools of higher learning in Nanjing 
attended the session as observers. The Standing Committee of 
the Jiangsu Provincial CPC Discipline Inspection Commission 
presided over the session. 
  The guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the CPC 
Central Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee and the 
important speech made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the 
plenary session were reported and studied at the plenary 
session. The guidelines of the State Council's meeting on 
anticorruption work and the important speech made by Premier Li 
Peng at the meeting were also reported and studied at the 
plenary session. The plenary session held that the fact that 
the Central Committee called on the whole party, while taking 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as the guide and keeping in mind the 
overall interest of party work, to deepen the anticorruption 
struggle in a sustained and more effective way is ample proof 
that the party Central Committee and the State Council are 
determined to combat corruption, improve party work style, and 
promote the building of a clean government, and demonstrates the 
common desire of the whole party and the people across the 
country. The plenary session unanimously expressed its support 
for this call and its determination to carry it out. 
  The plenary session heard the speech made by Chen Huanyou, 
secretary of the Jiangsu provincial party committee and Jiangsu 
governor. It agreed that the requirements for deepening the 
anticorruption struggle set by Comrade Chen Huanyou in line with 
the guidelines of the Central Committee are clear, and the 
measures he proposed are forceful and that since they are in 
line with the Jiangsu's reality, they must be earnestly 
implemented. The plenary session discussed and endorsed the 
"Opinions on Implementing the Guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and 
Deepening the Anticorruption Struggle in a Sustained and More 
Effective Way" delivered by Cao Keming, deputy secretary of the 
Jiangsu provincial party committee and secretary of the 
provincial discipline inspection commission, on behalf of the 
Standing Committee of the provincial discipline inspection 
commission. 
  The plenary session maintained that the party committees, 
governments, and discipline inspection organs at all levels 
across the province have done a large amount of work in 
conscientiously implementing the party Central Committee's and 
the State Council's "Decision on Successfully Handling a Few 
Tasks Related to the Anticorruption Drive in the Near Future," 
that the anticorruption drive has enjoyed a healthy development, 
and that Jiangsu has achieved phased, marked successes in 
carrying out the three tasks since we began implementing the 
guidelines of the Second Plenary Session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission in August 1993. However, we 
must be aware that the progress of the work is still uneven, 
that some successes are not consolidated, and that negative and 
corrupt phenomena are still very serious at present. By no 
means can we afford to slacken the anticorruption drive in the 
slightest degree. It is necessary for party organizations at 
all levels and the broad masses of party members across the 
province to conscientiously study the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission 
as well as Comrades Jiang Zemin's and Li Peng's important 
speeches, to further improve understanding, to seek unity of 
thinking, to resolutely launch the anticorruption drive in depth 
and over a protracted period of time in accordance with the 
anticorruption work-related plans and requirements of the 
central authorities and the provincial party committee while 
consolidating the successes we have achieved so far, to make 
efforts to successfully fulfill various tasks, and to achieve 
greater successes than last year's. 
  We must conscientiously do a good job in ensuring that 
leading cadres of the party and government are honest and 
exercise self-discipline. Leading cadres of the party and 
government organs at and above the county (department) level 
must continue to implement the five regulations put forth by the 
central authorities last year as well as the three requirements 
put forth by the provincial party committee, and must 
conscientiously implement the five regulations put forth and 
reiterated by the central authorities this year. We must 
combine the efforts to ensure party and government cadres' 
honesty, self-discipline, self-inspection, and self-correction 
with organized supervision and supervision by the masses to 
guarantee that all regulations are practically implemented. 
Cadres of the party and government organs at and below the 
county (department) level must behave themselves in conformity 
with the regulations on cadres' honesty and self-discipline, 
too. Leading cadres of enterprises and institutions also must 
be honest, exercise self- discipline, observe disciplines, abide 
by laws, and oppose various negative and corrupt phenomena, such 
as abusing power to seek personal gains, committing 
embezzlement, taking bribes, and indulging in squander and waste. 
  We must further step up efforts to handle criminal cases and 
concentrate efforts on investigating big, important cases. We 
must persist in treating the investigation of 
discipline-violating and law-breaking cases involving leading 
bodies and leading cadres of the party and government, judicial 
departments, administrative law- enforcing departments, economic 
administration departments, and their working personnel as the 
major work. We must focus attention on investigating cases 
involving leading cadres' committing embezzlement, taking 
bribes, and abusing power for personal gains; cases involving 
law and discipline-enforcing personnel's committing malpractices 
out of personal consideration, perverting justice for a bribe, 
and breaking the laws during law enforcement; and 
discipline-violating and law-breaking cases involving legal 
persons. We must resolutely implement the policy of being 
strict with party members and government functionaries, strictly 
enforce the laws and discipline, and sternly punish corrupt 
elements. Those who violate party and government discipline and 
criminal law must be dealt with in strict accordance with the 
party and government discipline and the laws. We absolutely 
must not let corrupt conduct have a "lenient environment" or let 
corrupt elements do whatever they like and remain at large. We 
must resolutely eliminate the phenomena of refusing to observe 
discipline or abide by laws and the phenomena of being lax in 
enforcing discipline and laws. We must sternly deal with those 
who give unprincipled protection to and harbor law and 
discipline violators. We must further strengthen coordination 
among discipline inspection organs, supervisory organs, judicial 
organs, and departments supervising administrative law 
enforcement to form a combined, integral force for handling 
cases and to improve the efficiency of big, important cases' 
investigation. We must continue to improve the work of treating 
the people's letters and complaints as well as the work of 
encouraging the people to report law and discipline-violating 
cases to the authorities, and practically protect the legitimate 
rights and interests of informers. We must commend and 
encourage those who have rendered meritorious services in 
informing against others for law and discipline violations, and 
sternly deal with anyone who retaliates against informers. 
  We must practically succeed in carrying out special tasks 
for sorting out unhealthy practices and in rectifying them. We 
must continue to conscientiously sort out and rectify 
unwarranted collection of fees. Collection of unwarranted fees 
whose cancellation has been announced must be stopped. From now 
on, any new item of fee for collection is not permitted to be 
arbitrarily added to the existing items without the provincial 
authorities' prior approval. We must pay close attention to 
implementing the regulations that accounting of revenues and 
expenditures of administrative levies and fines must be done 
separeately. We must conscientiously check up on and rectify 
illegal possession and noncompensatory use of enterprises' 
vehicles, computers, and communication equipment by organs or 
individuals; transferring enterprises' funds under various 
pretexts to the illegal coffers set up by institutions for their 
private use or to be used for the welfare of staff and workers; 
and other unhealthy practices. We must resolutely put an end to 
the unhealthy practice of requisitioning donations from 
enterprises under various pretexts. We must continue to pay 
close attention to sorting out the party and government organs' 
setting up enterprises and doing business. We must resolutely 
finish the work of handling the economic entities set up by 
organs which are not permitted to set up enerprises and the 
economic entities which are required to terminate their 
relationship with organs by the end of June. We must continue 
to do a good job of lightening peasants' burden, resolutely 
reduce their unreasonable burden, do a good job of checking up 
on and rectifying the use of public funds on travels abroad 
(outside national boundaries) for tourism from start to finish, 
strictly examine plans for travel abroad (outside national 
boundaries) on official business before granting approval, and 
resolutely curb the excessive activities of traveling abroad 
(outside national boundaries) on official business. 
  The plenary session maintained it is necessary for us to 
fight corruption by looking into both its root cause and 
symptoms, to take comprehensive measures to deal with the 
problem, and to persist in encouraging honesty and 
industriousness in the performance of official duties. We must 
improve education in adherence to the party's mass line, in its 
purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, in fighting 
corruption and advocating honesty, and in professional ethics 
among the vast numbers of party members and cadres. We must 
conduct widespread activities of education in enhancing the 
concept of party spirit and in setting an example of honesty in 
the performance of official duties among party members and 
cadres. We must vigorously encourage healthy trends and carry 
forward the fine tradition and work style of being honest and 
industrious in the performance of official duties for the 
people. We must strengthen the building of a legal system; we 
must establish and perfect a system on improving party style, 
running a clean and honest government, and encouraging 
industriousness in the performance of official duties; and we 
must improve the mechanism of interaction through supervision 
and strengthen democratic supervision by the masses in a bid to 
make our drive to improve party style as well as the running of 
a clean and honest government gradually embark on a track of 
standardization and systematization. 
  The plenary session called on discipline inspection organs 
and supervisory organs at all levels to conduct supervision over 
law enforcement at focal points in a planned way by revolving 
their efforts around the implementation of the important 
decisions and measures adopted by the party Central Committee, 
the State Council, the provincial party committee, and the 
provincial government on deepening reform, promoting economic 
development, and maintaining stability. They are required to 
expose, investigate, and deal with in a timely manner those who 
refuse and fail to enforce orders and prohibitions, practice 
fraud to deceive superiors and delude subordinates, harm the 
interests of the whole out of consideration for local interests, 
interfere with reform and development, use public office for 
private gain, abuse power for personal gains, and neglect their 
duties so as to guarantee the smooth implementation of various 
policies and measures adopted for reform and development. 
  The plenary session stressed that the party committees and 
governments at all levels must strengthen leadership over the 
anticorruption work, that they must practically adhere to the 
strategic principle of "grasping two links and taking a tough 
stand on both at the same time," that they must mobilize all 
party members, that the party and government must make joint 
efforts to handle their work, that the principal comrades in 
charge of the party and government [organizations] must 
personally pay attention to the work, that they must persist in 
the leadership responsibility system, that those at the higher 
level must supervise the work of those at the lower level and 
set an example for the latter, and that those at higher and 
lower levels must take concerted actions to guarantee that 
various anticorruption tasks are carried out to the letter. 
They must give full play to the role of press units to 
successfully publicize the anticorruption drive. They must 
strengthen leadership over discipline inspection and supervisory 
work and support such organs to fulfill their duties and 
successfully carry out their work. The discipline inspection 
and supervisory organs at all levels must further improve 
themselves, actively fulfill their duties of discipline 
inspection and supervision, and promote their work to a new 
level. 
  The plenary session called on Jiangsu's party organizations 
at all levels and its broad masses of party members to 
resolutely implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session 
of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, to unite as 
one, to handle tasks in a down-to-earth manner, to unswervingly 
launch the anticorruption drive, and to make new contributions 
to deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting economic 
development, and maintaining social stability under the guidance 
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line.

  [Text] Nanjing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- China's current reform of 
its taxation and foreign exchange systems has made it favorable 
for the healthy growth of foreign-funded enterprises instead of 
obstructing it. 
  The conclusion has been drawn from facts in Jiangsu Province 
over the past few months since the institution of the new 
taxation and foreign exchange systems at the beginning of this 
year. Jiangsu ranks the second in China in terms of the number 
of foreign-funded enterprises. 
  The Nantong Chia Tai Group Company, a Sino-Thai joint 
venture 
in Jiangsu Province, reported a gain of 3.7 million yuan in 
profits in the first quarter of this year. It has decided to 
spend an additional three million yuan on upgrading its 
technology and equipment. 
  "We firmly endorse the new tax system and take the lead in 
implementing it," said Tanes Seriburi, vice-president of the 
agro-ind. business group under the Chia Tai group of companies, 
in a letter to the provincial tax authorities. 
  Kam Sueg Hoon, manager of the Lianyungang Jinwu Seasoning 
Company Ltd, said, "the new tax system is getting closer to 
international conventions. It has many points in common with 
the tax system in the Republic of Korea. It is much easier to 
understand than the old one." 
  Teruju Kawakami, general manager of the Nanjing Fujitsu 
Telecommunications Equipment Company Ltd, complained of 
increased expenditure due to the unification of the exchange 
rates, but he had to admit that the reform is fair to all 
enterprises in the country. 
  He is optimistic about the future of his company in China as 
China's market of posts and telecommunications is fast expanding. 
  China abrogated the former consolidated industrial and 
commercial tax, which required tax payment at every link of 
production and circulation, and instituted the value-added tax, 
which requires part of the former tax payment. Parallel with 
the reform is the unification of the state pegged rate and the 
swap market rate. 
  "The reform measures are favorable for further opening to 
the 
outside world and promote the development of foreign-funded 
enterprises," said Wong Ronghua, director of the provincial tax 
bureau. 
  "The reforms have equalized the tax burdens of all 
enterprises, thus putting them on an equal footing in 
competition," he said. "The new tax system would make it 
favorable for enterprises to improve their economic efficiency." 
  Jiangsu had approved 21,161 foreign-funded enterprises by 
the 
end of March this year, ranking second in the country after 
economically booming Guangdong Province in southern China. More 
than 8,000 of them are in operation. 
  A sample survey shows that most of the foreign-funded 
enterprises have expressed their understanding of and welcome 
for China's current reform. "While the new tax system is being 
enforced, the preferential policies with regard to income tax on 
foreign-funded enterprises remain intact," he said. "For 
foreign-funded enterprises which have their tax burden increased 
due to the payment of turn-over taxes, the province adopted the 
method of postponing such payment pending the promulgation of 
the detailed rules for the implementation of the state 
regulations on tax refund for foreign-funded enterprises." 
  He said that the current tax reform has in fact reduced to 
varying degrees the tax burdens of most foreign-funded 
enterprises. 
  A survey of six foreign-funded enterprises in Zhenjiang 
shows 
that five have found their tax burdens down while only one said 
its tax burden has increased. Computed according to the base 
figure of 1993, the average tax burden of the six enterprises 
has been reduced by 31.9 percent. 
  The reform of the exchange rate system over the past four 
months proved that it has not caused any difficulty to 
foreign-funded enterprises in the use and settlement of foreign 
exchange. 
  Zhang Bingyu, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Foreign 
Exchange Center, said foreign exchange markets and offices are 
still carrying on their business of servicing foreign-funded 
enterprises which sell and purchase foreign currencies. 
  According to statistics, foreign-funded enterprises sold 124 
million U.S. dollars on and purchased 266 million U.S. dollars 
from these markets and offices in the first quarter of this year. 
  Zhang noted that a foreign-funded enterprise may open a 
foreign currency account with a bank and transfer and use its 
foreign currency. So far, the province has 175 banking offices 
engaged in such business, ranking first in the country. 
  A survey of 5,078 foreign-funded enterprises shows that 
these 
enterprises generated industrial output value amounting to 10.37 
billion yuan in the January-March period, up 56 percent over the 
same period of last year, obtained sales income totalling 7.82 
billion yuan, up 60 percent, and made profits of 180 million 
yuan, up 29 percent. 
  These enterprises exported 346 million U.S. Dollars-worth of 
goods in the first quarter of this year, an increase of 18.5 
percent over the same period last year, and accounting for more 
than one fourth of the province's total. 
  Accord)ng to the survey, therare still a few 
foreign-funded 
enterprises affected by the reform of the tax and exchange rate 
systems and their production cost has increased. 
  "So long as these enterprises improve their production 
management, they are still able to gain ideal economic 
efficiency," an official in charge of the survey said. 
  One example is the Huafei Color Display Systems Company Ltd, 
a large Sino-Dutch joint venture in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu 
Province. The company has overcome the rise in the cost of 
production materials by rearranging its product structure, 
raising the percentage of product qualification and reducing 
production costs. 
  The company exported more than three million U.S. 
dollars-worth of products in the first four months of this year. 
  According to the provincial commission of foreign economic 
relations and trade, a number of noted companies from the 
Netherlands, Britain, Singapore and Japan have increased their 
investments in Jiangsu this year.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The listed companies in 
the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China's largest economic 
center, are leading the area's economic development. 
  Pudong is a newly-established economic zone that is expected 
to lead the transformation of Shanghai's industrial and 
financial sectors. 
  According to the latest statistics, Pudong commended 100 
robust industrial enterprises last year, and seven of the first 
ten have listed their stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. 
  These 100 enterprises generated profits totalling 3.323 
billion yuan last year, accounting for 77.8 percent of the total 
in the area. 
  Included was 1.03 billion yuan made by the seven listed 
companies, about one third of the profits generated by the 100 
enterprises. 
  A local official said that these companies are able to raise 
funds at home and abroad to boost production, and the market 
economy has forced them to alter their operational mechanism so 
as to ensure rapid economic growth. 
  Of the 100 industrial enterprises, 17 are listed companies, 
24 foreign-funded ones, and the rest major state enterprises and 
rural industrial businesses.

Work Report Delivered by Ge Shengping, chief procurator of the 
Zhejiang Provincial People's Procuratorate, at the Second 
Session of the Eighth Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress on 2 
March"] 
  [Text] In 1993, procuratorial organs in the province, 
under the leadership of the provincial CPC committee, various 
levels of party committees, and the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, and under the supervision of various levels of 
people's congresses and their standing committees, persisted in 
treating the economic construction as the central task; 
implemented the policy of "promoting the reform and opening up 
with one hand and cracking down on serious crimes with the other 
and of placing equal emphasis on both"; took an overall view of 
the procuratorate work through strict enforcement of the law and 
working hard at cases; stressed handling of major and important 
cases; strengthened supervision over law enforcement; achieved 
new progress in the procuratorate work; and brought into play 
the functions and roles of the procuratorial organs in 
maintaining political and social stability, promoting the reform 
and opening up, and developing the economy. 
<H5>  I. Give Particular Emphasis to Investigate Into and Handle </H5>
Major and Important Economic Crimes, Including Corruption and 
Bribery Cases 
  The process of establishing a socialist market economic 
system has effectively brought about economic development. 
However, because of new systems replacing the old ones and 
because of a lack of complementary legal systems and management 
measures, economic crimes, including corruption and bribery 
cases, tend to grow; this tendency has even infiltrated into the 
political domain. Because of various reasons, the number of 
economic crime cases, including corruption and bribery cases, 
reported by the masses and placed on file by the procuratorial 
organs for investigation registered a sharp drop at one time in 
the first half of 1993. This caused great dissatisfaction among 
the broad mass of the cadres and the masses. From the second 
half of the year, particularly following the important decision 
adopted by the CPC Central Committee in August on enhancing the 
anticorruption struggle, the province's procuratorial organs 
conscientiously implemented the CPC Central Committee's 
decision; relied closely on party leadership and the masses' 
support; concentrated energy on investigating into and handling 
major and important cases; stepped up efforts to crack down on 
economic crimes, including corruption and bribery cases, by 
adopting a resolute attitude and a down-to-earth work style and 
by paying close attention to case-handling quality. Following 
are the initial results of the anticorruption struggle: 
<H5>  Major and Important Cases That Have Been Put on File for </H5>
Investigation and Handling Increase Markedly 
  In 1993, economic crime cases, including corruption and 
bribery cases, that were placed on file for investigation and 
handling totalled 1,958, of which 1,219 were major and important 
cases, or 62.3 percent of the cases that were placed on file for 
investigation and handling, representing an increase of 18.6 
percent over 1992; particularly serious cases involving over 
100,000 yuan topped 152, doubling those in the previous year. 
The proportion of major and important cases and the number of 
particularly serious cases set all-time records. Major and 
important cases that were placed on file for investigation and 
handling after August in 1993 were 699, or 57.3 percent of all 
the major and important cases that were placed on file for 
investigation and handling in that year, up 1.43 fold as 
compared with the same period in 1992. Thanks to stepped-up 
efforts on case- investigation, the province's procuratorial 
organs helped the state and collectives recover 65.74 million 
yuan in economic losses. 
<H5>  Remarkable Progress was Reported in Investigating Criminal </H5>
Cases, Including Corruption and Bribery Cases, Involving 
Personnel Working at Party and Government Organs, Judicial 
Departments, Administrative and Law Enforcement Departments, and 
Economic Management Departments 
  A total of 366 persons who worked at the afore-mentioned 
organs and departments were put on file for investigation and 
handling for involvement in economic crimes ranging from 
corruption to bribe-taking, accounting for 16.3 percent of the 
total number of cases which were placed on file for 
investigation and handling; 156 were involved in major cases 
amounting over 10,000 yuan, including 56 party and government 
personnel, 23 judicial personnel, 17 administrative law 
enforcement personnel, and 60 financial personnel; 99 were 
cadres at department and section level and nine were cadres 
working at county governments at departmental level or above. 
<H5>  A Number of Major Criminal Cases That Seriously Disrupted </H5>
Socialist Market Economy's Order Received Timely Investigation 
and Handling 
  Coordinating with the decision of the CPC Central Committee 
to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, various 
levels of procuratorial organs placed on file for investigation 
and handling according to the law a number of criminal cases 
including corruption, bribery, embezzlement cases that were 
exposed during the rectification of the financial order, of 
which 60 were particularly serious cases, up 62.2 percent from 
the previous year. To ensure legitimate and fair competition, 
various levels of procuratorial organs also stepped up efforts 
to crack down on such crimes as trademark infringement, tax 
evasion, and refusal to pay taxes; 108 cases were placed on file 
for investigation into the crime of trademark infringement, an 
increase of 10.2 percent over the previous year; 235 
tax-invasion and refusal-to-pay taxes cases, of which 183 were 
particularly serious ones, were also placed on file for 
investigation and handling. 
<H5>  The Masses' Enthusiasm for Informing on Economic Crimes Was </H5>
Further Encouraged and Mobilized 
  The number of cases in which the masses reported on economic 
crimes rose sharply, particularly following the decision adopted 
by the CPC Central Committee in August to strengthen the 
anticorruption drive. By the end of 1993, the province's 
procuratorial organs accepted and handled 15,292 cases reported 
by the masses, of which 9,013 gave clues to corruption and 
bribery cases, up 31.9 percent and 35.4 percent, respectively, 
from the previous year. This produced a shattering effect on 
some economic criminals. The province saw 84 economic criminals 
involved in corruption and bribery cases surrendering themselves 
to procuratorial organs. 
  Procuratorial organs in the province stressed the following 
in investigation into and handling corruption: 
  1. Stepped Up Leadership and Make Constant Efforts To 
Achieve a Common Understanding 
  In this regard, redoubled efforts were made to settle two 
questions: First, we enhanced our confidence and resolve in 
executing the drive. Under the new situation, procuratorial 
organs have encountered many new circumstances and new problems 
in punishing such economic crimes as embezzlement and bribery. 
For a while early last year, a few procuratorial units and 
cadres balked at punishing economic crimes like embezzlement and 
bribery for fear of difficulty. The provincial procuratorate 
took quick action in March and April by sending personnel to 
carry out an extensive investigation and analysis of the new 
circumstances and problems at the grass-roots level and to 
formulate measures to deal with them. A provincial antibribery 
work conference in May particularly addressed the aforementioned 
problems in regard to understanding. It guided the cadres to 
acquire a clearer understanding of the situation, plucked up 
their spirit, and enhanced their resolve to energetically 
prosecute cases, serious and important cases in particular. 
Second, we clearly defined the guiding principles for our work. 
In line with the policy decision of the CPC Central Committee 
on stepping up the anticorruption drive, the provincial 
procuratorate convened a forum of chief procurators and held a 
telephone conference on the investigations and prosecution of 
major economic crimes involving embezzlement and bribery. The 
two meetings educated and guided cadres to enhance their 
awareness of overall interests; to enhance their resolve to 
uphold the party's basic line; to serve unswervingly the central 
task of economic construction; to strictly enforce the law and 
aggressively prosecute crimes -- serious and importance cases in 
particular -- as their primary task and principal means in 
serving economic construction. The meeting called for firmly 
implementing the principle of "being firm, meticulous, and 
accurate," stepping up investigations and research, drawing a 
clear distinction between what constitutes a criminal offense 
and what does not, emphasizing accuracy in prosecuting cases, 
and heeding the social effect of the cases prosecuted. The 
meetings also outlined the work policy of "prosecuting crimes 
aggressively, giving priority to major cases, strictly enforcing 
the law, and ensuring quality." As a result, the broad ranks of 
procuratorial cadres enhanced their understanding of the 
importance and urgency of punishing graft, bribery, and other 
economic crimes; heightened their sense of responsibility and 
mission; and brought their enthusiasm and initiative into better 
play. 
<H5>  2. Concentrated Efforts on the Investigation and Prosecution </H5>
of Major Cases 
  The principal measures implemented in this regard are as 
follows: 1) chief procurators take personal charge in 
prosecuting cases. A division of responsibilities was 
instituted among the chief and two deputy chief procurators of 
the provincial procuratorate and they all took personal charge 
of major cases that had an impact provincewide. Localities also 
implemented a similar system whereby the chief or deputy chief 
procurators were required to take personal charge of major 
cases. Over the past year, chief procurators at all levels in 
the province personally took part in the investigation and 
prosecution of 635 major cases. 2) Lists of major cases were 
compiled by phases and procurators were assigned to handle them. 
The province stepped up supervision and guidance over 
prosecutions and redoubled efforts in investigation and 
prosecution. The provincial procuratorate drew up three such 
lists comprising 115 major cases of embezzlement and bribery. 
By the end of last year, investigations were completed in 103 
of the cases on the lists and court proceedings were started in 
72. 3) Crime investigative efforts were redoubled. Special 
attention was paid to uncovering cases -- serious and major 
violations in particular -- involving party and government 
organs through the investigation of ordinary cases. 4) Efforts 
were stepped up in capturing criminals at large. The province 
stepped up efforts in investigating cases involving people who 
absconded with money after committing a crime, promptly 
arresting more than 30 such criminals, of whom nine were guilty 
of embezzling or taking bribes amounting to over 100,000 yuan. 
5) Instituted a system of responsibility and incentives for the 
investigation of major cases. Chief procurators at all levels 
are required to take personal responsibility for the 
investigation of major cases in their respective jurisdictions 
or localities; the procuratorate at the lower level is required 
to answer to the procuratorate at the next higher level and the 
latter is required to provide, on its own initiative, guidance 
and assistance when the lower level encounters difficulties in 
its work. The provincial procuratorate promulgated "Regulations 
on Awarding and Commending Collectives or Individuals With 
Meritorious Services in Cracking Major Cases of Embezzlement and 
Bribery." Collectives or individuals with excellent services in 
investigating and prosecuting major cases were commended and 
rewarded in a timely fashion. 
<H5>  3. Encouraged People To Report on Crimes </H5>
  At the fifth anniversary of the establishment of corruption 
investigation and crime hunting centers, procuratorial organs in 
the province launched a propaganda month on crime reporting and 
mounted a well-organized publicity campaign. Meanwhile, efforts 
were stepped up in sieving tips received to better utilize the 
information and to speed up investigations of major offenses. 
Thanks to such tips, 455 major cases were placed on file for 
investigation. Information provided by the masses was crucial 
for the successful prosecution of most of the nine major cases 
in Zhejiang involving cadres at the section level or higher. 
Procuratorates also took great care in protecting the 
legitimate rights and interests of the informants and the 
persons they informed against; they prosecuted 14 cases 
involving retaliation against informants and 13 cases of false 
charges against innocent people. 
  4. Depended on Party Committees' Strengthened 
Leadership and Supervision of People's Congresses and Closely 
Cooperated and Coordinated With Departments Concerned 
  Anticorruption struggle must be guided under the strong 
leadership of party committees. Procuratorial organs at all 
levels frequently asked for instructions from and reported to 
party committees. With the help from party committees at all 
levels, procuratorial organs unified awareness, eliminated the 
barriers and interferences encountered while prosecuting cases, 
and resolved such practical difficulties as lack of funds for 
prosecuting cases. People's congresses and their standing 
committees at all levels attached great importance to the 
anticorruption struggle. Procuratorial organs received 
supervision and support from the people's congresses. The 
provincial procuratorate invited some deputies to the national 
or provincial people's congresses to attend forums and heard 
people's deputies' views on the anticorruption struggle. In 
September, the provincial procuratorate made a special report on 
law enforcement and supervision over such economic crimes as 
embezzlement and bribery to the standing committee of the 
provincial people's congress. In the second half of the year, 
procuratorial organs in various localities launched a campaign 
to vigorously receive people's congresses' appraisal opinions on 
judicial organs and started a large-scale inspection of law 
enforcement. Focused on the problems discovered in the 
self-inspections and opinions solicited from the people's 
congresses, procuratorial organs conscientiously rectified and 
reformed themselves. The chief procurator personally supervised 
and prosecuted cases which had received most attention from the 
people's congresses. Procuratorial organs at all levels 
strengthened contacts, communicated, coordinated, and cooperated 
with the discipline inspection, supervision, and other judicial 
organs to unify their strength. 
<H5>  5. Strictly Enforce the Law and Ensure the Quality of Cases </H5>
Prosecuted 
  Procuratorial organs conscientiously carried out the 
Constitution and laws and strictly prosecuted cases according to 
law. Adhering to the principle of prosecuting cases resolutely, 
carefully, and correctly, we decisively and accurately punished 
criminals. At the same time, we paid attention to formulating 
methods and strategies and made contributions to economic 
development by seriously prosecuting cases. Procuratorial 
organs adhered to the principles, faced up to difficult work, 
eliminated interferences and barriers, and prosecuted cases 
without fail. Moreover, we did a careful and solid job in 
prosecuting cases. While deciding on verdicts, we insisted on 
making judgments on the basis of facts according to law. As to 
observing laws and policies, we strictly followed laws and 
implemented reform policies. With regard to new situations and 
problems arising in the law enforcement process, we stressed the 
need of studies and investigations and carefully dealt with 
these problems. Procuratorial organs firmly cracked down on 
crimes of various kinds, enthusiastically supported new things 
coming up in reform, guarded development of productive forces, 
and protected the initiative of the broad masses of cadres and 
people. 
  II. We Insisted on Severely and Swiftly Cracking Down 
on Grave Crimes To Preserve Social Stability 
  Procuratorial organs across the province insisted on 
regarding severely clamping down on serious crimes as important 
work for maintaining social stability and for ensuring that 
reform, opening up, and modernization drive were carried out 
smoothly. They faithfully implemented the policy of severely 
and swiftly punishing criminals according to law and 
unrelentingly clamped down on all kinds of serious crimes. Last 
year, 27,330 criminals were referred to procuratorial organs by 
public security organs, of which 24,109 were arrested according 
to law; and 27,126 criminals were indicted, of whom 22,943 were 
prosecuted. Arrested and prosecuted criminals in 1993 were 
respectively 21.1 percent and 14.6 percent more than the 
previous year. 
<H5>  1. We Insisted on Stepping in Early and on Swiftly Arresting </H5>
and Indicting Felony Criminals Caught in Action 
  We swiftly responded to felony crimes involving man 
slaughtering, robbery, raping, hooliganism, and explosions, and 
cases involving use of violence. We stepped in such cases early 
and swiftly arrested and indicted criminals according to law. 
Last year, procuratorial organs began early to handle 3,310 
exceptionally grave criminal cases and a number of felony 
criminals who were caught in action and those who had bad 
influence on society were severely and swiftly punished. 
<H5>  2. We Actively Took Part in the "Three Crackdowns and One </H5>
Prohibition" Struggle 
  In compliance with the resolution adopted by the Fourth 
Meeting of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress Standing 
Committee on resolutely cracking down on grave crimes, and 
following the work plan for carrying out the "Three Crackdowns 
and One Prohibition" struggle -- which centers on clamping down 
on crimes committed by groups of criminals -- which was laid 
down by the Provincial Committee For Comprehensive Management of 
Public Security, the Provincial Procuratorate issued a circular 
in a timely manner setting out specific guidelines for all 
procuratorates to take part in the struggle. Following the 
unified planning of the local party committee and a 
procuratorate at a higher level, procuratorates across the 
province took swift actions and actively threw themselves into 
the struggle. In carrying out their work, all procuratorates 
placed importance on conducting investigations and on looking 
into the real situations; focused on dealing with key problems; 
and strictly enforced the policy and laws. On cases submitted 
for examination to decide whether those involved should be 
arrested and indicted, procuratorial workers worked overtime to 
do their work and ensured that their work was done quickly and 
accurately. During the first and second battles of the 
struggle, a total of 18,137 criminals who had committed various 
crimes were arrested, of whom 16,815 were indicted, thereby 
ensuring that the struggle would be carried out properly. 
<H5>  3. We Stepped Up Crackdown on Smuggling, Illegal Exiting the </H5>
Country by Boat, and Other Crimes 
  Last year, 32 smugglers, of whom 13 were grave criminals, 
were arrested and indicted. In view of the fact that illegally 
exiting the country by boat is quite a serious problem in some 
localities, and according to the guidelines of the provincial 
meeting on fighting illegally exiting the country by boat, 
relevant procuratorates, in conjunction with local public 
security organs, ensured that such crimes were duly dealt with. 
A deputy chief procurator of the provincial procuratorate who 
was in charge of illegal exit led a team to Lishui County and 
Qingtian County to conduct investigations and to provide 
guidance on work in this regard. 
  4. We Took Active Part in Comprehensive Management 
of Public Security 
  Conscientiously implementing the policy of combining stern 
punishment with leniency, cracking down on a small number of 
criminals, and saving the majority of offenders through 
reeducation, procuratorial organs throughout the province 
resolutely gave swift, stern punishments to both principal and 
habitual criminals, and paid attention to saving first 
offenders, casual offenders, and juvenile delinquents who had 
committed misdemeanors through reeducation. Giving play to 
their role of making procuratorial suggestions, they made 386 
procuratorial suggestions to help the units at which criminal 
cases had occurred consolidate situation, make corrections, plug 
loopholes, improve systems, and prevent crimes. They visited 
criminals absolved from prosecution more often to step up test 
and judgment of the latter, helped with the implementation of 
supervision and reeducation measures, and promoted obedience of 
the laws and confession to crimes by those absolved from 
prosecution. In accordance with the party committees' 
centralized plan, they closely coordinated with relevant 
departments to properly handle contingencies, to deal a swift, 
heavy blow to heinous criminals in accordance with the laws, and 
to step up the propaganda of and education in the legal system 
among the masses, thereby eliminating destabilizing factors in 
good time and maintaining social stability. 
<H5>  III. We Conscientiously Investigated and Dealt With Crminal </H5>
Cases of "Infringement on Others' Rights" and Dereliction of 
Duty, and Protected Citizens' Legitimate Rights and Interests, 
as Well as National Interests 
  Procuratorial organs throughout the province earnestly 
treated the investigation and handling of such criminal cases as 
"infringement on others' rights" and dereliction of duty as an 
important aspect of and measure for intensifying the 
anticorruption drive and for cementing the flesh-and-blood ties 
between the party and the masses. They practically attached 
importance to the task. A total of 2,393 various law-breaking 
and discipline violations were handled in the whole province. 
Among them 427 cases were placed on file for investigation; 64 
of them were specially big criminal cases. Procuratorial organs 
throughout the province retrieved economic losses worth more 
than 2.71 million yuan for the state and collectives through 
their handling of cases. 
  1. We Focused on Investigating and Handling Criminal 
Cases Involving Law-Enforcement Personnel 
  We put on file and investigated 16 criminal cases involving 
20 judicial and administrative law-enforcement personnel who 
perverted the law by taking bribes, conducted fraudulent 
practices out of personal considerations, and extorted 
confessions by torture. Among these cases, seven were committed 
by nine law-enforcement personnel who conducted fraudulent 
practices out of personal considerations, representing the 
largest number in recent years. 
<H5>  2. We Attached Importance to Investigating and Handling </H5>
Criminal Cases Involving "Rights-Infringement" and Dereliction 
of Duty, Committed in the Process of Conducting Economic Activity 
  Provincewide, we put on file and investigated 50 criminal 
cases involving illegal detentions in the process of carrying 
out business and trade activities; 146 major cases involving 
incidents arising from negligence during the process of 
production, operation, and construction; and 48 criminal cases 
involving dereliction of duty. Forty-four of the above cases 
were of serious or major proportions. When investigating and 
handling the above criminal cases, procuratorial organs focused 
on analyzing the root causes of crimes, on summing up 
experiences, on making suggestions about prevention, and on 
helping relevant units and departments heighten their guard. 
<H5>  3. We Actively Investigated and Handled Crimes of Disrupting </H5>
Elections, Thus Ensuring the Smooth Progress of End-Of-Term 
Elections 
  During last year's end-of-term elections for people's 
congress deputies, procuratorial organs throughout the province 
regarded efforts to enhance procuratorial functions and ensure 
the smooth progress of end-of-term elections as their major 
political tasks, took the initiative to strengthen their 
contacts with relevant departments, kept themselves abreast of 
crimes committed to disrupt elections in violation of the law, 
and put on file and investigated according to law cases 
involving actions which constituted crimes. As regards ordinary 
cases involving law violations, procuratorial organs promptly 
passed them to relevant departments for further handling after 
conducting thorough investigations. Provincewide, procuratorial 
organs accepted, heard, and conducted initial investigations 
into 77 cases involving disruptions of elections, and put on 
file and investigated 16 of these criminal cases. 
<H5>  IV. We Strengthened Supervision Over Law Enforcement and </H5>
Safeguarded the Socialist Legal System 
  Safeguarding the unified and correct enforcement of state 
legislation is an important function of procuratorial organs. 
Since 1993, procuratorial organs throughout the province have 
satisfied the requirements imposed on the legal system by the 
socialist market economic system; earnestly observed the 
principle by which we ensure that "there are laws to abide by, 
that laws already enacted are observed and enforced to the 
letter, and that violators are brought to justice"; and focused 
on strengthening the legal supervision of law-enforcement 
activities through various procuratorial undertakings. 
  In our legal supervision over investigative activities 
launched by investigative organs, we exercised supervision by 
tracking the actual situation in which arrests of criminals were 
approved and made, and using this as our breakthrough point, 
focused on tightening procuratorial supervision over such issues 
as failure to investigate an offense. We submitted to public 
security organs a total of 343 suggestions for correcting 
violations of the law, arrested an additional 198 criminals 
according to law, indicted an additional 199 people, and decided 
against arresting 1,734 people and indicting 71 others. As a 
matter of checks and balances, we also tightened supervision 
over cases under investigation by procuratorial organs. 
Following investigations and inspections made by criminal 
investigative departments, we arrested and indicted five more 
people involved in criminal cases pertaining to economic 
activity, law, and discipline, and rejected requests to arrest 
25 people and indict 11 others. 
  In exercising legal supervision over judicial activities 
carried out by judicial organs, we focused on strengthening our 
efforts to contest cases according to law. In criminal trials, 
we focused on supervising and contesting cases where guilty 
persons were judged innocent, serious offenses were given light 
sentences, and minor offenses were given heavy sentences. In 
all, we contested 87 cases in court. In civil, economic, and 
administrative trials, we focused on supervising and contesting 
cases where mistakes were actually made in handing down verdicts 
and rulings. We handled 297 such cases, investigated and put on 
file 54 of them, and contested four cases in court. We 
suggested to the courts that the verdicts in 25 cases be 
amended, leading the courts to amend the verdicts in three cases. 
  In exercising legal supervision over prison management and 
labor reform activities conducted by prison management and labor 
reform organs, we focused on strengthening procuratorial 
supervision over the arbitrary collection of fees from people 
under prison management and from their families; the use of 
money to buy one's way out of punishment; prison management and 
labor reform personnel who demanded and took bribes, conducted 
fraudulent practices out of personal considerations, and 
released criminals without authorization while carrying out 
procedures to mitigate sentences, to release criminals on 
parole, and to recommend criminals for medical treatment outside 
the prison; and prison management and labor reform personnel who 
physically punished and tortured criminals. We submitted 4,781 
suggestions to prison management and labor reform departments 
about correcting law-violating actions, and curbed and corrected 
the arbitrary practice of collecting fees. We also corrected 
the practice of holding 676 criminals beyond their detention 
periods, and took corrective actions against 407 people who 
violated the law when handling criminals outside the prison. We 
also put on file and investigated 15 criminal cases involving 
prison management and labor reform personnel who practiced graft 
and bribery and physically punished and tortured criminals. We 
approved the arrest of and indicted, according to law, 138 
repeat offenders who underwent "reform-through-labor and 
rehabilitation-through- labor," and promptly took strong 
measures against people who reverted to criminal activities 
after having undergone prison supervision. 
  In our procuratorial work regarding accusations and appeals, 
we focused on strengthening our efforts to reexamine criminal 
appeals cases. We handled 443 cases of appeals against 
procuratorial organs' decisions rejecting certain lawsuits, 
refusing to put certain cases on file, turning down requests for 
arrests, and dropping certain cases. Among them, we reexamined 
373 cases in which appeals were filed against decisions 
rejecting lawsuits, and amended our original decisions in 52 
cases. We also handled 500 appeals against court decisions and 
rulings on criminal cases. We substantially enhanced our 
functions of serving as an internal restrictive factor and an 
external supervisory force in procuratorial work concerning 
accusations and appeals. 
<H5>  V. We Built Up the Procuratorial Ranks and Promoted Strict </H5>
Law Enforcement 
  Procuratorial organs throughout the province further built 
up 
their ranks by simultaneously improving their professional work 
and bolstering their ranks. Although they bore heavy 
responsibilities, faced many difficulties and hardships, and 
were subject to relatively heavy pressures from all quarters, 
most procuratorial cadres withstood the trials of market economy 
and strenuous work, consistently maintained high morale, stuck 
to principle, impartially enforced laws, happily made 
contributions, and displayed a good mental attitude. A group of 
advanced collectives and individuals emerged from among these 
procuratorial cadres, thus ensuring and promoting progress in 
law enforcement by procuratorial organs. We focused on three 
aspects: 
<H5>  1. We Strengthened Leading Bodies at All Levels </H5>
  Across the province last year, seven cities and 
procuratorial 
branches and 87 grass-roots procuratorates held end-of-term 
elections for procurators general. The provincial procuratorate 
and various city procuratorates and procuratorial branches 
actively coordinated with party committees in earnestly 
selecting, assessing, and grooming candidates for procurators 
general, moving in concert with people's congresses to ensure 
that the end-of-term elections were held properly. For a 
certain period of time after the end-of-term elections, we 
concentrated on improving leading procuratorial bodies under the 
provincial party committee's unified plans. With the change of 
terms, leading procuratorial bodies at all levels were 
strengthened. 
  2. We Made Efforts To Ensure Honesty of 
Procuratorates Themselves in Performing Official Duties 
  The people's procuratorates are important function 
departments in the anticorruption campaign. However, those 
organizations themselves are also important departments to be 
examined in the anticorruption campaign, and so it is especially 
important to ensure their own honesty in performing official 
duties. The people's procuratorates at various levels should 
have a high sense of political responsibility and consciously 
and seriously take actions to prevent their own corruption. In 
the first half of last year, stress was laid on improving 
discipline and work style of cadres. In the second half of last 
year, people's procuratorates in the whole province considered 
the prevention of corruption of themselves as an important part 
in implementing the arrangements of the central authorities in 
fighting against corruption. The provincial people's 
procuratorate put forward specific opinions on how to strengthen 
people's procuratorates' own anticorruption struggle and 
formulated 10 measures to promote honesty in performing official 
duties. Leading cadres at and above department level were 
organized to check and examine themselves according to the 
requirements for self-discipline set by the central authorities, 
the provincial party committee, and the provincial people's 
procuratorate. The situation of wanton collection of fees by 
some procuratorates at the basic level was stopped. The 13 
cases of violation of discipline by procuratorial cadres were 
seriously handled one by one, and those who were involved in 
three serious cases were punished according to the Criminal Law. 
The provincial people's procuratorate also distributed a 
circular to various units to draw lessons from those cases and 
educate the broad masses of cadres. 
<H5>  3. We Strengthened Training on Professional Knowledge </H5>
  While promoting education on procuratorial work through 
television university and study for procurator's certificate, we 
strengthened professional trainining for all cadres. The 
provincial people's procuratorate held several short-term 
training classes for procuratorial cadres on hearing complaints 
and petitions and on civil administration. The provincial 
people's procuratorate also held competition in debates by 
public prosecutors and unfolded activities of evaluating 
outstanding public prosecutors for three times. Various local 
procuratorates also adopted various ways and forms to raise 
cadres' professional quality and ability. 
  Although people's procuratorates in the province made new 
achievements over the past year, there are still many problems 
and shortcomings. They mainly include the following: 1) 
Various people's procuratorates have made certain achievements 
in the anticorruption struggle; however, there is still quite a 
large gap between those achievements and the expections and 
demands of the party and people. The people's procuratorates 
are not strong enough in discovering and exposing crimes, 
especially major cases. 2) Legal supervision over execution of 
court judgments by law enforcement units is still a weak link. 
There are the problems of using fines to replace imprisonment 
or passing light sentences on serious crimes, and supervision 
over legal work is not effective in some localities. 3) Funds 
for handling legal cases are inadequate, and office facilities 
and equipment to handle criminal cases are simple and backward. 
Some improvements have been made with the support of 
governments at various levels, but funds and facilities still 
cannot meet the need of the situation and procuratorial tasks. 
4) The provincial people's procuratorate is still not strong 
enough in guiding the handling of various legal cases, 
especially major cases. We must look squarely at those problems 
and shortcomings, and seriously solve them in our future work. 
  We must continue to maintain the good trend in developing 
the 
national economy this year. The year 1994 is also a crucial 
year in promoting reform. The overall requirement of this year 
is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, 
promote development, and maintain stability. The people's 
procuratorates must be subordinate to and serve this overall 
requirement. The guiding ideology and main tasks of 
procuratorial work in the whole province are: Under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, we 
should implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, adhere to the policy of "doing two types of work at 
the same time and attach equal importance to both," further 
emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, enforce law in a 
strict manner, make greater and concentrated efforts to 
investigate and handle major and serious cases, crack down on 
various criminal activities, protect citizens' lawful rights, 
and make new contributions to accelerating the establishment of 
a socialist market economic structure, ensuring the sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, 
safeguarding social and political stability and promoting an 
all-round improvement of the society. We should lay stress on 
doing well the following tasks: 
  -- We Must Continue To Concentrate Our Efforts on 
Prosecuting Major and Important Cases, Especially Important 
Cases, So as To Deepen the Anticorruption Struggle 
  The struggle against corruption, bribery, and other decadent 
phenomena is a protracted mission. The cases that have been 
exposed show that corruption, bribery, and other economic crimes 
remain serious. We must never overestimate our success and 
underestimate the seriousness and the menace of these crimes, as 
well as the importance of deepening the struggle. In accordance 
with the consolidated plans drawn up by the Central Committee 
and the provincial party committee, procuratorial organs must 
carry out the policy of promoting material progress and 
socialist ethics at the same time, persist in waging a 
protracted struggle against crimes, work earnestly, and make 
constant efforts to deepen the struggle. This year's 
anticorruption struggle should focus on concentrating our 
efforts on prosecuting major and important cases, especially 
important cases involving leading cadres. Efforts should be 
made to achieve new breakthroughs. Criminal cases -- especially 
major and important cases -- taking place within leading party 
and government organs, judicial departments, law enforcing 
departments, and economic departments must be firmly handled 
according to law as soon as they are discovered. Meanwhile, in 
accordance with the policy that we must act firmly but 
cautiously and aim at the right targets, we must improve the 
quality of prosecution and make sure that cases are properly 
prosecuted so that our operations will yield even better 
political, economic, and social results. 
<H5>  -- We Must Uphold the "Crackdown" Principle and Come Down </H5>
Hard on Serious Crimes 
  We must be more politically sensitive and harshly and 
efficiently crack down on all types of serious crimes according 
to law. We must take active part in comprehensive management of 
public security, correctly handle the contradictions among the 
people, promptly eliminate factors that cause instability, and 
work hard to create a stable social environment facilitating 
reform, opening up, and economic construction. To ensure 
political stability, we must also intensify procuratorial 
operations to ensure state security and firmly strike at 
counterrevolutionary crimes as well as infiltration and 
subversive and sabotaging activities launched by hostile forces 
inside and outside Zhejiang. 
<H5>  -- We Must Continue To Intensify Supervision Over Law </H5>
Enforcement 
  We must attach special importance to prosecuting crimes 
committed by judicial personnel and law enforcers who abuse 
their authority for personal gains, accept bribes and bend the 
law, commit graft, and fail to enforce law strictly. We must 
dare to uphold principle and exercise legal supervision over law 
enforcing authorities' lawless conduct. To intensify 
supervision over law enforcement, procuratorial organs must be 
strong enough to accept challenge. To do an even better job in 
enforcing law in a civil manner, procuratorial organs must be 
strict in handling lawless conduct appearing in the prosecution 
of criminal cases. 
<H5>  -- We Must Exert Great Efforts in Building a Contingent of </H5>
Procuratorial Personnel 
  Procuratorial cadres must earnestly study Volume 3 of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," arm our minds with Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics so as to further heighten our awareness and 
firmness in implementing the party's basic line and in serving 
economic construction. Procuratorial cadres must strive to 
improve our political awareness and professional competence, and 
continue to intensify the anticorruption efforts among ourselves 
so that procuratorial operations can be expedited with the 
establishment of a contingent of procuratorial personnel who are 
politically strong, professionally keen, tough in work style, 
and strict in discipline.

  [Text] The Guangdong Public Security Department held a 
meeting for secretaries of discipline inspection committees of 
public security bureaus of all cities in the province from 26 to 
28 April to seriously sum up and exchange recent experiences 
among all public security organs in the province to launch an 
anticorruption drive and to make arrangements for work in this 
respect in the future. Chen Shaoji, a member of the Standing 
Committee of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee and director 
of the provincial public security department, emphasized at the 
closing session this afternoon that leading cadres in public 
security organs at all levels should take the lead in setting an 
example in diligently and honestly carrying out official duties. 
Chen Shaoji also urged leading cadres, especially the 
number-one men, in public security organs at all levels to 
strengthen their sense of democratic supervision and to 
consciously accept supervision from all quarters. They should 
strengthen their sense of organization and discipline and should 
strictly enforce orders and prohibitions so that the combat 
effectiveness of public security organs will be expressed among 
leading cadres first of all.

  [Text] The Guangdong Provincial Government held an 
emergency telephone meeting this afternoon. The meeting called 
for curbing indiscriminate fund-raising to ensure the 
fulfillment of the task of issuing treasury bonds as scheduled 
across the province. 
  The task of issuing treasury bonds assigned by the state to 
Guangdong this year involves 6.71 billion yuan. By the 25th of 
this month, the province had issued 12.13 and 18.84 percent of 
the two-year and three-year treasury bonds respectively, ranking 
last among the provinces. The major reason why Guangdong has 
been slow in issuing treasury bonds is that some localities have 
indiscriminately raised funds and raised interest rates. 
  The provincial government has demanded that the whole 
province take action to correct illegal activities of 
indiscriminately raising funds and that various localities 
complete the issuance of 50 percent of the two-year treasury 
bonds and more than one-third of the three-year bonds by the end 
of this month and to complete the issuance of all two-year 
treasury bonds by the end of May and all three-year treasury 
bonds by the end of June. This task should be grasped 
personally by the number-one men in party and government 
organizations in various localities and its fulfillment should 
be ensured by organizations at all levels. Responsibility shall 
be affixed to anyone who delays the fulfillment of this task. 
  The telephone meeting held this afternoon was chaired by 
Governor Zhu Senlin. Vice Governors Lu Ruihua and Ou Guangyuan 
also spoke at the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Special report": "Shenzhen Strengthens Management Over </F>
Military Vehicles"] 
  [Text] Shenzhen, 12 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- Some days ago, 
the Shenzhen Garrison issued a "Circular on Strengthening 
Management Over Military Vehicles in the Shenzhen Area" in order 
to straighten out the operational order of military vehicles in 
Shenzhen and to curb the illegal manufacture, selling, and use 
of military vehicle certificates by lawbreakers. 
  The purpose of the circular is to implement the relevant 
instructions of the Guangzhou Military Region and the Guangdong 
Provincial Military District. The circular demands that all 
military institutions stationed in Shenzhen should check their 
military vehicles before the end of April; those holding 
certificates at or above the division level should obtain a 
"military vehicle registration form" from the garrison and 
submit the filled-out form for verification. After verification 
that the military vehicle's license plate number conforms with 
the driving license number, the garrison will issue a "military 
vehicle registration certificate." On discovery, individuals 
using military vehicles in Shenzhen without registration 
certificates will be given severe punishments according to the 
relevant regulations. 
  Unqualified localities, units, or individuals illegally 
obtaining military vehicle certificates must stop using these 
certificates immediately, return them to the original users, or 
submit them to the garrison. Those who continue to use these 
certificates will be held responsible and will receive severe 
punishments according to the relevant regulations. 
  The circular points out that counterfeiting military vehicle 
certificates, and selling or using false certificates are 
illegal. Individuals involved in these activities must confess 
their offenses to the Shenzhen Garrison before 30 April to 
receive lenient treatment. Otherwise, public security 
departments will hold them responsible for the criminal offenses 
they have committed. 
  The circular stipulates: Military vehicles are not allowed 
to be used for production purposes, and buses with military 
license plate numbers are not allowed to be used for business 
purposes. Vehicles for construction and transportation use must 
observe the local government's relevant regulations, and are not 
allowed to operate in excess of their capacity or to pollute the 
city's environment. Military vehicles without rear mudguards, 
dirty vehicles, or vehicles in bad technical condition will not 
be issued "military registration certificates"; these vehicles 
are not allowed to operate. 
  The circular demands that military vehicle drivers strictly 
observe traffic rules, foster good professional ethics and 
driving habits, follow the instructions of traffic policemen, 
and consciously safeguard the Army's reputation.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 28 April, the Hubei Provincial 
Government sent six touring price inspection teams and a central 
inspection team to various localities to carry out price 
inspection and curb price increases in our province. 
  At a mobilization meeting for the general price inspection 
teams, Vice Governor Chen Shuiwen said: Considerable results 
have been obtained in the general price inspection, which 
started at the beginning of March. The illegal price-increasing 
activities of some enterprises, administrative and nongovernment 
institutions, and self-employed businessmen have been curbed to 
a certain extent, but the progress of the general price 
inspection has been uneven. Price increases in some localities 
have not yet been effectively controlled. The prices of a few 
commodities have even bounced up again. The phenomenon of 
raising prices and collecting fees at will has not been totally 
wiped out, so the provincial government has decided to organize 
touring teams consisting of comrades from the price, planning, 
supervision, finance, and taxation departments, as well as some 
representatives of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, so as to carry out price inspections in various 
localities. It hopes to obtain good results in this period as 
soon as possible. 
  According to the provincial general price inspection office, 
the work of the current general price inspection is focused on 
important means of production, especially rolled steel, 
electricity, coal, oil, and chemical fertilizers; on activities 
of monopolizing a trade so as to increase prices and thereby 
reap staggering profits; on various commodity prices and 
service charges listed as daily requirements of residents which 
fall within the scope for supervision and examination; on all 
enterprises, plants, and shops that do not put goods on sale 
with prices clearly marked; and on administrative and 
nongovernment institutions that abuse their power to collect 
fees at will, that is, to see whether or not the first list of 
75 items and the second list of 68 items published and abolished 
by the Ministry of Finance and the State Planning Commission, 
and the first list of 220 items and the second list of 250 items 
published and abolished by the provincial government really have 
been abolished. 
  The provincial government demanded that the prices of key 
commodities and services be inspected one by one at all levels 
and that violations of the regulations concerned should be dealt 
with severely. In particular, a small number of enterprises and 
establishments that do not enforce orders or prohibitions and 
that continue to raise prices should be inspected and punished 
severely and should be made known to the public.

  [Text] Wuhan, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei 
Province has simplified its enterprise registration system, 
following the example of Hainan Province and other Chinese 
regions. 
  Under the new system, enterprises need no longer get 
approval 
from government bodies other than the Industry and Commerce 
Administration to go into operation. 
  To start an enterprise, an investor need only submit three 
documents instead of the previous 11. 
  An eligible application will automatically be approved by 
the 
Industry and Commerce Administration, which will then issue the 
business permit and give public notice of the same, official 
sources said. 
  The new system also attaches no restrictions to an 
enterprise's business range, except where state monopoly, public 
security or health are involved. Therefore, no special licenses 
are necessary, the sources said. 
  They noted that the new system is not yet fully applicable 
to 
stock companies, solely state-owned companies or group 
companies, as it is still in the experimental stage.

  [Text] Wuhan, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The technology market is 
flourishing in this capital city of central China's Hubei 
Province. 
  Statistics reveal that the volume of business transactions 
at 
the city's technology market amounted to 1.088 billion yuan over 
the past three years. 
  According to local officials, large and medium-sized 
enterprises of the city have become the main clients of the 
technology market. 
  For instance, last year these enterprises took 61.4 percent 
of the city's total technology transactions, said the officials. 
  The wide application of new technology has helped many 
enterprises with bad economic records to tide over difficulties.

  [Excerpts] The 13th meeting of the planning and 
construction committee of the capital was held on 27 April. 
Chen Xitong, member of the political bureau of the CPC Central 
Committee, secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, and 
chairman of the planning and construction committee of the 
capital, stressed that we must strictly safeguard and implement 
the plan and resolutely wage the struggle against all the 
phenomena of violating and damaging the plan. 
  Li Qiyan, mayor of the municipality and first vice chairman 
of the planning and construction committee of the capital, said 
in his speech: In 1983, the party Central Committee and the 
State Council decided to set up the planning and construction 
committee of the capital to examine, work out, and implement 
short-term plans and annual plans for the overall urban 
construction of Beijing; to organize and formulate urban 
construction and management rules; and to coordinate the 
relations of all fronts. This is extremely necessary. [passage 
omitted] 
  Hou Jie, minister at the Ministry of Construction and vice 
chairman of the planning and construction committee of the 
capital, said in his speech: Big headway and great changes have 
been made in the urban construction of the capital. Both 
Chinese and foreign personages are satisfied at this. [passage 
omitted] 
  In his speech, Chen Xitong expressed his welcome to the 
members of the newly readjusted capital planning and 
construction committee. He said: Under the leadership of the 
party Central Committee and the State Council and with the 
support of all departments and commissions, the capital has made 
big headway in construction. However, it still far lags behind 
the requirements of the central authorities and the target of 
having the style and features of an ancient capital as well as a 
modern, international, large city. We should make efforts in 
the next decades in order to attain the target. This task is 
still arduous. The main tasks of the readjusted capital 
planning and construction committee are to implement the 
"overall urban construction plan of Beijing" and to fulfill the 
heavy trust of the party Central Committee, the State Council, 
and the people. 
  Chen Xitong stressed: We must strictly safeguard and enforce 
the plan and resolutely wage the struggle against all the 
phenomena of violating and damaging the plan. The current plan 
has richer contents than the previous ones. It is a blueprint 
for economic and social development as well as a program to 
guide construction and development. Without the plan, urban 
construction will become disorganized or disorderly. Beijing 
was the ancient capital of five dynasties. The predecessors' 
plans were good, so does the "overall plan" revised this time. 
Such a good plan in the world should fully be cherished. There 
are only reasons for safeguarding, perfecting, and developing it 
but no grounds for damaging or going against it. Beijing is the 
capital of our great socialist motherland as well as a 
shopwindow of China and reflects the image of China. So, 
cherishing and safeguarding the plan is cherishing the capital. 
This is the awareness of the capital. 
  Chen Xitong pointed out: The phenomena of going against and 
damaging the plan were very serious in the past. Great 
improvement has been made through the elimination of the 
disorderly, scattered, and weak situation over the past years. 
However, some phenomena of going against and damaging the plan 
still exist. If we do not resolutely wage a struggle against 
these phenomena, the fulfillment of the plan will become an 
empty talk. To ensure the smooth implementation of the plan, 
first of all, leaders should take the lead in strictly carrying 
out the plan. All the major issues, the issues going against 
the plan, or the issues concerning the necessity to 
appropriately readjust the plan according to the demands of the 
objective reality should be decided, according to different 
conditions, jointly by the chairman and vice chairmen of the 
planning and construction committee of the capital or by the 
plenary sessions of the committee. No individuals have the 
rights to making decisions. Second, construction units should 
consciously submit themselves to and implement the plan. They 
must not pay attention to only economic results to the neglect 
of the plan. Third, the planning departments should strictly 
make management, supervise the implementation of the plan, have 
the daring to make criticisms, not be afraid of giving offense, 
upgrade their quality, set strict demands on themselves, and 
realistically assume responsibility for the implementation of 
the plan.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730): "Strengthen </F>
Structural Readjustment, Optimize Distribution of Production 
Factors, and Strive To Halt Deficits and Maintain Stability"] 
  [Excerpts] A few days ago, Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
Beijing Municipal Party Committee, went to Beijing Copper Wire 
Plant to conduct investigations. He fully affirmed the new 
change taken place at the plant as a result of the efforts to 
halt deficits made by this plant and the nonferrous metal 
general company. He again stressed: In a certain sense, the 
endeavor in halting deficits and increasing profits is precisely 
aimed at ensuring stability and using the new opportunity 
brought about by the market economy to accelerate structural 
readjustment and optimize distribution of the production 
factors. [passage omitted] 
  With a history of 40 years, Beijing Copper Wire Plant is a 
small enterprise producing copper as well as copper alloy wire 
and strips. The plant now employs 348 workers. In recent years, 
its products have enjoyed good sales and have been exported to 
the United States, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions. 
It has earned over $1 million every year, and the demand of its 
products has exceeded the supply. However, owing to fund 
shortages, its output and performance have kept on declining 
since last year. In the first quarter of this year, it even 
suffered a loss for the first time. After allocating a certain 
amount of circulating funds to this plant through the full 
cooperation of departments concerned, output in April registered 
a 20 percent increase over the average month output in the first 
quarter. In addition, the morale of its staff and workers was 
stable and they were enthusiastic about production. [passage 
omitted] 
  Chen Xitong said in his speech: Today, after looking at the 
plant and hearing the report on the work of this general 
company, I have noticed the good spirits of workers and staff 
members. From the general company to its subordinate plant, 
staff and workers have all been vigorous in halting deficits, 
thus effecting an improvement in production and giving rise to a 
new atmosphere throughout the enterprise. This is the result of 
the concerted efforts of leaders and the working class of the 
general company and the plant. I hope that you will keep on 
working hard. Facts prove that it is completely necessary to 
support the enterprises and trades having good marketing and 
good performance, like the Beijing Nonferrous Metal General 
Company, by allocating appropriate amounts of circulating funds 
to them. 
  Chen Xitong pointed out: To rapidly popularize the 
experience 
in carrying out comprehensive reform gained by this first light 
industrial general company, the essential idea is to use the new 
opportunity and the favorable conditions brought about by the 
market economy to carry out structural readjustment and optimize 
the distribution of production factors. In the endeavor of 
halting deficits and carrying out structural readjustment, we 
should resolutely break with the idea of "brand, position, and 
face," the idea of "mine, yours, and his," and the idea of 
"waiting for higher levels' support, loans, and improved 
situation." If we fail to break with these three ideas, we will 
lose opportunity, efficiency, and popular support. We should 
make cadres more aware in submitting themselves to the central 
authorities' general task of "seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability." We should also clearly 
explain to workers that structural readjustment is in agreement 
with the essential interest and long-term interest of workers 
and staff members. He again stressed: In a certain sense, the 
endeavor of halting deficits and increasing profits is precisely 
aimed at ensuring stability. We should continue to carry out 
the method of resolving problems by looking into both its causes 
and signs. At the moment, the most urgent task is to make staff 
and workers have something to do, to make enterprises 
profitable, to make workers' lives ensured, and to make workers' 
income raised on the basis of developing production and 
improving efficiency. Otherwise, stability will be impaired and 
problems will be hard to be resolved thoroughly. 
  Then, Chen Xitong discussed with enterprise leaders on the 
cross-defaults owed between different enterprises. He also 
affirmed the measure adopted by the plant to withdraw loans.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Efforts should be 
made to strengthen regional co-operation to promote economic 
development along north China's Bohai Bay, an official said here 
today. 
  Chen Liyou, deputy governor of north China's Hebei Province, 
said that the Bohai economic rim is China's third economic 
booming area following the Zhujiang and Chang Jiang River Deltas. 
  Located at the center of the Bohai rim, Hebei should give 
top 
priority to the development of regional economic co-operation, 
he said. 
  He added that redoubled efforts should be made to strengthen 
infrastructure facilities such as highways and ports in the 
province to promote regional prosperity. 
  Hebei serves as a major gateway for the country's coal 
exports from inland provinces and also as a link for other 
provinces and cities within the economic rim, including 
Liaoning, Shanxi and Shandong Provinces, and Beijing and Tianjin 
Cities, the official said. 
  The province also boasts geographical advantages and rich 
natural resources. It has a coastline of 487 km. 
  He noted that the provincial government has decided to work 
hard to upgrade its numerous state-owned enterprises in the 
metallurgy, chemicals and building materials industries. 
  The province has also made great efforts to harness the 
Yanshan and Taihang Mountains to bolster economic development 
and social stability in the area of Beijing and Tianjin and on 
the north China plain. 
  In infrastructure construction the province has listed ten 
major projects to fit in the development of the Bohai economic 
rim, the official said. 
  Talking about railway construction, he said that emphasis 
will be placed on the building of the Shenmu-Huanghua Railway 
leading from northern Shaanxi Province to Bohai Bay, and the 
Handan-Jinan Railway from Handan City in Hebei Province to 
Jinan, capital of Shandong Province. 
  At the same time, he said, the construction of the northern 
section of the Beijing-Shenzhen and Beijing-Shanghai Expressways 
will also be accelerated this year. And the pace of building 
other expressways and highways in the province will be quickened. 
  He added that an expressway and highway network will soon be 
built in the ring area, including roads and highways for coal 
transportation. 
  In addition, construction of ports and airports in this area 
will be strengthened. The focus will be on building the 
Huanghua Port, the Jingtang Port at Tangshan City and the 
Shijiazhuang International Airport. 
  Speaking of energy resources, the deputy governor said that 
to ease the bottleneck in power supply in the area, the province 
will step up the building of its own power stations while 
importing electricity transmitted from Shanxi Province and the 
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  He said that in telecommunications construction nearly 20 
national and local optical fiber lines will be built within the 
province. 
  The official said that the focus of iron and steel 
industrial 
construction will be on the expansion and rebuilding of six 
major steel production bases to produce a total of more than 
five million tons a year. 
  The province will also channel more funds toward the 
development of several water-control projects to meet the demand 
for drinking water in the Beijing-Tianjin area.

  [Text] Hohhot, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
has reiterated here the principle of seizing the current 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside 
world, promoting development and maintaining stability. 
  He stressed that the principle, set by the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of China (CPC), should be conscientiously 
carried out and attention should be paid to the harmony of 
development speed and economic efficiency so as to further 
promote reform, opening and economic development. 
  Premier Li made these remarks during his April 30-May 3 
inspection tour of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on 
returning from a visit to four countries in Central Asia and 
Mongolia. 
  Accompanied by Wang Qun, secretary of the CPC Inner 
Mongolian 
Autonomous Regional Committee, and Ulgi, chairman of the 
regional government, Premier Li visited factories, enterprises, 
microwave telecommunications installations, construction site of 
a large thermal power station and homes of some herdsmen. 
  On May 3, Premier Li attended a presentation of the work 
report of the leading party and government officials of Inner 
Mongolia and delivered a speech. 
  He affirmed the great achievements in reform, opening up and 
economic development made by the people of various nationalities 
in Inner Mongolia under the guidance of the theory of Deng 
Xiaoping on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. He 
said he has been in Inner Mongolia six times since 1978 and has 
seen with his own eyes the great changes taking place there. 
  He noted that Inner Mongolia used to have shortages in grain 
supply, but has now managed to have surplus grain. "This is a 
great achievement," he stressed. 
  Meanwhile, he said, the animal husbandry of the region has 
also been developing rapidly and the annual steel output of 
Baotou Iron and Steel Company has been increased from one 
million tons to three million tons. 
  Premier Li said that by exploiting its rich coal resources, 
Inner Mongolia has built enough large power stations not only to 
be self-sufficient in power supply, but also to supply 
electricity to the areas of Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan. 
  Premier Li said that he was glad to see the political 
stability, ethnic unity, economic development and improvement of 
living standards of Inner Mongolia. 
  He urged local officials to pay even closer attention to 
production in agriculture and animal husbandry and make more 
efforts to run well numerous large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises in the region. 
  He pointed out that unity among various nationalities in 
Inner Mongolia is good and expressed hope that the region will 
further develop the good situation and realize common prospects 
among the people of all nationalities in the region.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Junjie (0491 0193 2638): "Wang Qun and Qian </F>
Fenyong Inspect Hulun Buir League"] 
  [Text] Further deepen reform, vigorously enliven 
enterprises, suit the development of the situation, and develop 
foreign economic relations and trade. This is what Wang Qun, 
secretary of the regional party committee, emphatically pointed 
out during his investigation and study activities in Hulun Buir 
a few days ago. 
  After inspecting the Honghuaerji fire-extinguishing scene 
and 
extending regards to the officers and men of the forest police 
forces and the staff and workers of the forestry bureau who 
fight fires, leading comrades, including Wang Qun, secretary of 
the regional party committee and chairman of the regional 
people's congress standing committee; and Qian Fenyong, deputy 
secretary of the regional party committee and chairman of the 
regional committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, jointly studied and discussed the 
issues on enterprise reform and foreign trade with the 
responsible comrades of Hulun Buir League, Hailar city, 
Manzhouli city, and Ergun Right Banner on 24-25 April in Hailar 
city. Wang Qun made an important speech during the talks. 
  In regard to the issue of enterprise reform, Wang Qun 
pointed 
out: Hulun Buir League has firmly attended to the enterprise 
reform. Its experience can be summarized as "great 
determination, powerful strength, accurate ways, meticulous 
work, and good results." Particularly, some good examples with 
outstanding achievements in reform have emerged. Hulun Buir 
League has made a good start in enterprise reform and should 
persist in its achievements. At present, we should further 
upgrade our understanding, enhance the sense of urgency and the 
sense of crisis, get rid of all difficulties, and make up our 
minds to accelerate the pace of enterprise reform. We must 
strengthen leadership and collective policy-decisions, and 
organize powerful forces to grasp the enterprise reform in the 
next few years. We should first make breakthroughs and then 
make improvements, conduct reform first among key enterprises 
and then among general ones, make overall plans and take all 
factors into consideration, and promote overall reform. Hulun 
Buir League's practice of organizing and sending more than 700 
cadres to enterprises to help conduct reform should be 
popularized. The fact that the party and government office 
cadres go deep to the grass roots to grasp the enterprise reform 
is conducive to changing the government functions and making the 
government work suit the socialist market economic system. To 
grasp the enterprise reform, we should grasp the buildup of 
leading bodies as well as the setup of mechanism and the 
upgrading of products. This is so-called auxiliary reform. 
Specific methods are to proceed from actual conditions; to seek 
truth from facts; to make different policies for different 
plants; to boldly conduct experiments; to make enterprises 
improve their quality, standing, and efficiency through reform; 
to conform to the "three-conducive" principle; and to avoid 
repetition of low quality. Through reform, we should enliven 
enterprises, turn deficits into profits, and increase efficiency 
and speed. We should have enterprise staff members and workers 
not only have meals to eat but also make contributions to the 
state. The more difficulties the enterprises have, the more 
necessary they should strengthen the ideological work and expand 
the dynamics of reform. Enterprises should first change their 
ideas to conduct reform. Like Hulun Buir League, all localities 
should organize groups and send them deep to the enterprises to 
disseminate the necessity of reform as well as the reform 
policies and measures, unify the thinking of the staff members 
and workers, and mobilize them to support and join reform. Only 
by so doing will we be able to ensure the smooth progress of 
enterprise reform. 
  In regard to the issue of foreign trade, Wang Qun pointed 
out: The Sino-Russian and Sino-Mongolian border trade, 
characterized by goods exchange, conforms to the needs of the 
peoples of both sides. Achievements have been made in this 
aspect. However, the border trade must not always stay at the 
level of goods exchange. We must develop border trade. Now, 
border trade is being changed into spot exchange trade. This is 
a trend of development as well as a new situation. Under the 
new situation, it is inevitable that temporary difficulties in 
border trade crop up. So, the foreign trade enterprises should 
study the new situation, resolve new problems, and upgrade to a 
new level. To this end, first, we should change ideas, reform 
simple foreign trade viewpoints, combine foreign economic 
relations and trade, link trade with industry and agriculture 
(animal husbandry), promote industry and agriculture (animal 
husbandry) with trade, and promote trade with industry and 
agriculture (animal husbandry,) develop general trade and 
multilateral trade, and expand foreign economic relations and 
trade. Second, the governments at various levels should regulate 
and control the macroeconomy, make unified plans in a coordinate 
manner, readjust the production of industrial enterprises and 
their product mixes according to the demands of the 
international market, and form economic and trade cohesive 
power. Third, we should expand the scale of opening up, bring 
in capital from all sides, and promote development through 
opening up. We should introduce foreign capital to conduct 
grafting transformation, develop production, increase the 
varieties of products, upgrade the quality, and enter the 
international market. 
  Qian Fenyong stressed in his speech during the talks: The 
key to conducting the enterprise reform is to mobilize the 
enthusiasm of staff members and workers. So long as the 
enthusiasm of the staff and workers is mobilized will 
enterprises be able to make good products and create good 
efficiency. He said: Hulun Buir League is an area 
experimenting with reform and opening up as defined by the 
state. So, the league should proceed from actual conditions, 
boldly make experiments, and have the courage to be the first to 
conduct enterprise reform and to develop foreign economic 
relations and trade.

<F P=106> [By Reporters Xu Dongyang (1776 2639 3152) and He Shumei </F>
(0149 3219 2734): "Accelerate Agricultural and Animal Husbandry 
Development and Strive To Enter a New Stage"] 
  [Excerpts] The regional party committee and government 
held a regional rural and pastoral work conference on 22 April, 
and clearly proposed that the time for Inner Mongolia Region to 
greatly develop agriculture and animal husbandry has arrived and 
that this region has every condition and ability to develop 
agriculture and animal husbandry in a quicker and better manner 
and to enter a new height on the present basis. [passage 
omitted] 
  Wang Qun and Wu Liji gave important speeches respectively. 
Qian Fengyong, Bai Enpei, Yi Junhua, Song Zhimin, and Wu 
Lunsai, and responsible comrades of various leagues, cities, 
regional departments concerned, and the regional rural and 
pastoral work leading group and units attended the conference. 
Bai Enpei presided over the conference. 
  In his speech, Wang Qun pointed out: While fully 
understanding the excellent situation, we should clearly 
recognize that we should set demands on ourselves in line with 
the high standards of modernizing agriculture and animal 
husbandry and the market economy. At present, our region's 
agricultural and animal husbandry production is still at a low 
development stage. The party Central Committee has stressed 
repeatedly that the issue on agriculture, animal husbandry, 
rural areas, and peasants is always a fundamental issue 
affecting the overall situation of our party and the state. 
Judging from our Inner Mongolia Region's situation, without the 
invigoration of agricultural and animal husbandry and the 
development of the rural and pastoral areas, there can be no 
economic invigoration and social development in Inner Mongolia, 
no social stability in the rural and pastoral areas, and no long 
period of order and security in the border areas. Therefore, we 
should conscientiously study, profoundly understand, and 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the central rural 
work conference, further understand the urgency of strengthening 
agriculture, animal husbandry, as well as rural and pastoral 
work from the overall situation of reform, development, and 
stability, firmly establish the ideology of regarding 
agriculture and animal husbandry as the foundation, unswervingly 
place agriculture and animal husbandry above all economic tasks 
at any time and under any circumstance, and uphold it for a long 
time with unremitting efforts. 
  Wang Qun said: The rural and pastoral works are numerous, 
and 
development is the essential criterion. Judging from the 
overall situation of the region, the current agricultural and 
animal husbandry development trend is good and the situation is 
gratifying. The broad masses of peasants and herdsmen have 
already seen the opportunity of having a good market for 
agricultural and livestock products and good prices and the 
local advantages and potential for developing agriculture and 
animal husbandry. Therefore, their enthusiasm in planting grain 
and raising livestock is unprecedentedly high and their desire 
to accelerate development is very strong. In the face of this 
situation, party leading cadres at all levels have the 
responsibility of protecting, guiding, and giving play to the 
enthusiasm and creativity of the masses; the responsibility of 
judging the hour and sizing up the situation, organizing leading 
peasants and herdsmen to advance on the crest of a victory, 
developing our region's agriculture and animal husbandry in a 
quicker and better manner, and entering a new stage on the 
present basis. The general objective of this new stage is to 
enable peasants to attain a better-off level of moderate 
prosperity on schedule by the end of this century which was once 
proposed by the regional party committee and the provincial 
government, to enable herdsmen to take the lead in becoming 
better-off, to basically realize the goal of developing 
modernized agriculture and animal husbandry with high yield, 
high quality, and high efficiency, to carry out all forms of 
integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture, to 
combine planting industry with breeding and processing 
industries, and to turn the region into an important base and 
market for brandname, quality, and special products, such as 
grain, oil-bearing crops, sugar, meat, milk, eggs, leather and 
fur products, fruits and medical herbs, in China's northern 
region. In line with this general objective, our region's 
agricultural and animal husbandry sectors must strengthen 
scientific and technological progress, raise the quality of 
personnel, strengthen the infrastructure facilities for 
agriculture and animal husbandry, mechanize agricultural and 
animal husbandry production, increase input, deepen reform, and 
carry out large-scale production and intensive operations. This 
year it is necessary to continuously increase the production of 
grain and animal husbandry on the basis of last year's 
production and strive to make the grain output reach 23 billion 
jin; the number of livestock reach 57 million during the animal 
husbandry fiscal year; the total revenue growth rate of township 
enterprises reach more than 50 percent; and the net income of 
peasants and herdsmen increase by 100 yuan after deducting the 
factor of price hikes. According to this demand, the higher and 
the lower levels across the region should adopt practical 
measures, make specific targets, and strive to attain the 
aforementioned objective. 
  After analyzing our region's possibility, necessity, and 
favorable conditions for accelerating the development of our 
region's agriculture and animal husbandry and entering a new 
stage, Wang Qun stressed: Our proposal of accelerating the 
development of agriculture and animal husbandry and entering a 
new stage on the present basis is in conformity with the 
guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee, the overall 
situation of reform, development, and stability, and the common 
interests and wish of the people of various nationalities across 
the region. The regional party committee has called on the 
broad masses of party-member members across the region, 
particularly the party's leading cadres at all levels, to 
further emancipate the mind, enhance understanding, 
realistically unite their ideology with the policy decision of 
the regional party committee, and guarantee the implementation 
of this policy decision with practical and effective deeds. 
Wang Qun pointed out: At present and for some time to come, 
the principle of deepening reform in the rural and pastoral 
areas is and will still be the four sentences proposed by the 
eighth plenary session of the 13th party Central committee, that 
is to stabilize and improve the responsibility system with the 
family-based output-related contract system as the mainstay, 
perfect the dual management system of centralized and 
decentralized management, actively develop various forms of 
socialized service system, and gradually expand the collective 
economic strength. The major content of reform is to take 
market cultivation as the mainstay, perfect the socialized 
comprehensive service system, strengthen macro regulation and 
control, and accelerate the establishment of economic 
operational mechanism and management system that suit the 
socialist market economic structure. First, we should further 
improve the rural and pastoral management system; second, 
organize and improve the township comprehensive service 
organizations; third, actively develop "dragon-typed economy"; 
fourth, strengthen macro regulation and control as well as 
protection in the agricultural and animal husbandry sectors; and 
fifth, deepen reform in rural and pastoral areas and in banners, 
counties, and organs, transfer personnel to all localities, and 
combine these two tasks together. 
  Wang Qun stressed: The objective of accelerating 
agricultural and animal husbandry development and entering a new 
height has set a higher demand on the party committees and 
governments at all levels, particularly the party's leading 
cadres at all levels. We must pay more attention to agriculture 
and animal husbandry and to the issues on peasants and herdsmen 
than at any time in the past, adopt practical and effective 
measures, and further strengthen and improve the party's 
leadership over rural and pastoral work. Party committees at 
all levels should realistically place rural and pastoral work 
above all economic tasks and further strengthen leadership. In 
the future, the work focus and main energy of the party 
committees of various leagues, cities, banners, and counties 
should be placed on agriculture, animal husbandry, and rural and 
pastoral work. It is necessary to continuously attend to 
building grass-roots organizations and ranks of cadres in the 
rural and pastoral areas. All banners and counties should be 
determined to select good quality cadres from all sectors and 
send them to work in townships, towns, and sumu and install good 
leading bodies in townships. We should realistically strengthen 
spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system in the 
rural and pastoral areas, and take a "two-handed approach in 
work and be tough with both." Through effective work, we may 
eliminate the destabilizing factors and create a good social 
environment for reform and development in the rural and pastoral 
areas. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On the evening of 4 May, Vice Governor Wang 
Zhongzhang met with a delegation from the Russian Maritime Kray 
Consumers Cooperative headed by (Dubining), first vice chairman 
of the Maritime Kray Soviet Executive Committee, at the Xinghe 
Hotel in Harbin. Both sides held talks in a cordial and friendly 
atmosphere. 
  Wang Zhongzhang said: Sino-Russian border trade is highly 
complementary. Our province has persistently regarded the 
Maritime Kray and the Far East Region as focal points in 
Sino-Russian trade. 
  Wang Zhongzhang expressed his satisfaction with the trade 
contacts between the Chinese and Russian sides during the past 
few years. He hoped that the governments of both sides will 
solve the existing problems with coordinated efforts, establish 
a joint committee, and develop mutual free trade. 
  (Dubining), head of the delegation from the Russian Maritime 
Kray Consumers Cooperative, said: Although some specific 
difficulties exist in the trade contacts between the two sides 
at present, these difficulties surely can be overcome as long as 
both sides make efforts.

  [Text] To encourage the province's construction enterprises 
and establishments as well as their staff and workers to 
energetically develop the export-oriented economy, the 
construction department, the foreign economic relations and 
trade department, the financial department, the personnel 
department, the foreign affairs office, the labor department, 
the tax affairs bureau, and the foreign exchange bureau of the 
province jointly issued, a few days ago, "several policies and 
regulations on encouraging construction departments in Liaoning 
Province to search for larger international markets and to open 
wider to the world." 
  These policies are mainly devoted to encouraging 
construction 
enterprises to seek contracts for foreign construction projects, 
to conduct labor service cooperation, and to engage in real 
estate business beyond the limitations of the countries and 
trade. Under these policies, enterprises that have appropriate 
conditions are encouraged to set up branch agencies and sales 
service centers abroad. For the staff and workers of these 
enterprises who have independently sought out foreign traders in 
an effort to work abroad, in accordance with employment 
contracts, their enterprises should keep them on the roster with 
no pay and should conduct exit formalities on their behalf by 
collecting a certain amount of expenses from them. For the 
staff and workers who engage in foreign labor or management 
service abroad with the approval of their original units and who 
have paid the old-age cash deposit to their units or to domestic 
labor insurance companies, their service abroad can be included 
in their length of service, and their wages on file can also be 
raised in accordance with the state unified wage readjustment. 
When these staff members and workers retire, they can enjoy the 
same treatment enjoyed by other staff members and workers. For 
personnel residing abroad, their spouses may also be sent abroad 
for employment or to accompany them. If responsible enterprise 
personnel located outside the territory have worked abroad for 
over a year, their spouses are allowed to accompany them and 
corresponding jobs for spouses should be arranged in line with 
the demands or spouse allowances should be given. The personnel 
residing abroad may enjoy one-month home leave every year. 
  The policies also stipulate: Enterprises should be 
vigorously encouraged to absorb foreign funds and to initiate 
Chinese-foreign joint ventures or cooperative enterprises. 
Enterprises should also be encouraged to use their existing 
sites, plant houses, equipment, property rights, and the 
self-owned funds to run joint ventures and cooperative 
enterprises and to carry out technological transformation of 
enterprises and to build urban infrastructure. Great efforts 
should be made to attract foreign investors to engage in real 
estate development. If it is demanded, enterprises are allowed 
to invite foreign specialists and scholars with high salaries. 
Those who have been able to bring in funds, projects, 
technologies, and professionals for their units and those who 
have offered good advice and suggestions for opening their units 
to the outside world should all be given cash awards, and those 
whose contributions are outstanding should be given handsome 
rewards. Those who are able to assist their units by obtaining 
project or scientific research results and well-trained, 
specialized personnel, including those studying abroad, can be 
transferred to construction units. Preferential treatment 
should be given to them in line with the regulations by cadre 
management authority.

  [Text] Taipei, May 5 (CNA) -- Three United States 
congressmen, concerned about Beijing's handling of the March 31 
murder and robbery of 24 Taiwan tourists, will meet with the 
victims' relatives to better understand the tragic incident, the 
Chinese association for human rights said Wednesday. 
  Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.), Rep. Dick Sweat (D-N.H.), and 
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) are expected to hold a 
Taipei-Washington, D.C., teleconference with the victims' 
relatives, an association spokesman said. 
  All three congressmen have previously expressed their 
concern 
about human rights conditions in Mainland China and are expected 
to ask the Taiwan relatives if Beijing's handling of the murders 
violated any human rights standards. 
  The spokesman said that the conference will probably take 
place on Saturday, one day before a Taiwan delegation is 
scheduled to leave for Mainland China for a two-week visit to 
find out more about the crime. 
  The spokesman said that the congressmen would ask questions 
about whether the relatives were under house arrests when they 
went to Zhejiang to identify the charred bodies, the facts about 
mainland authorities prohibiting newsmen from approaching the 
boat, and about the mainland performing autopsies before the 
arrival of the relatives.

  [Text] Taipei, May 5 (CNA) -- The manufacturing industry's 
investment willingness, a leading economic indicator, remained 
sluggish in the first quarter of 1994, the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said Thursday [5 
May]. 
  IDB statistics show that the number of newly established 
enterprises hit 1,413 during the period, up 1.9 percent over the 
same period last year. 
  The aggregate registered capital of these new companies, 
however, decreased 26.8 percent to NT [new Taiwan dollars] $18.6 
billion (US$701.88 million). 
  The figures pointed to a slowdown in the growth of 
large-size 
enterprises, officials said. 
  Meanwhile, a total of 1,505 companies increased their 
investment by NT$76 billion (US$2.86 billion) in the three-month 
period, down 60.3 percent from a year ago. 
  The officials noted that both new investments and capital 
increments have been on the decline since January 1993. The 
whole year of 1993 saw a 35.45 percent drop in manufacturing 
investment growth, they added. 
  Investment growth reached a peak of 40 percent in 1992 after 
four consecutive years of growth, they said. 
  IDB Director-General Yin Chi-ming pledged that the bureau 
will keep a close watch on the continued slump in domestic 
manufacturers' investment willingness.

<F P=106> ["Qiandao Lake Grim Murders Unfolded"] </F>
  [Text] The Zhejiang provincial prosecutor on April 19 
approved the arrest of three suspects involved in the March 31 
robbery and murder of 24 tourists, six crew members and two tour 
guides on March 31 on the province's Qiandao Lake. 
  Further investigations are under way, the provincial public 
security bureau said on April 22. 
  The criminals Wu Lihong, Yu Aijun and Hu Zhihan, all local 
residents, were friends and they shared the aim of making money 
without honest labor. 
  Wu Lihong first proposed robbing tourists on Qiandao Lake. 
When he discussed it with Hu and Yu, they immediately agreed to 
join him. They then planned the time, place and means to carry 
out the robbery, according to the three men's confessions. 
  In the early evening of March 31, the three took their motor 
boat out to the waters at Huangmiling, where they knew there 
would be few boats and ships at night. 
  At that time, two tourist boats, Qiandaohu No. 6 and 
Huangshan No. 3 passed by. The three did not dare to move for 
it was still dusk and there were a few other boats passing by. 
  When the tourist boat named Hairui came into the area, it 
was 
dark and raining, and there were no other boats in the vicinity. 
The three intercepted it. 
  As soon as they boarded the Hairui, they threatened the crew 
with hunting guns and an ax, forcing them to go down to the 
lower cabin of the boat. They then asked all the passengers to 
hand over their cameras, jewelry, watches and money, and forced 
them to move into the cabin, saying that they would not harm 
them. 
  After the robbery, the three attempted unsuccessfully to 
sink 
the boat by opening the water valve. They then set fire to the 
boat killing the tourists and the crew, and then fled. 
  Two hours later when the Hairui did not show up as 
scheduled, 
the local department concerned immediately sent out speed boats 
to look for it. Because there was a heavy fog, they were unable 
to find the boat until 0800 the next day. 
  They immediately reported to the local government, which 
organized people and boats to explore the area, since no 
survivors were found on the deck of the burning boat. 
  Firemen extinguished the flames and towed the boat to shore, 
where they found that all the tourists, guides and crew had died 
in the lower cabin. 
  After the incident, the Central Committee of the Chinese 
Communist Party and the State Council ordered the Zhejiang 
provincial authorities to deal promptly with the case and 
uncover the facts behind the incident. 
  The provincial government and Hangzhou city government 
formed 
a group to handle the matter. They took measures to help the 
relatives of the Taiwanese victims identify the remains and 
personal articles and arrange for mourning according to 
Taiwanese customs. 
  Proper arrangements were also made with regard to the crew 
and tourist guides who died in the incident. 
  Meanwhile, the Public Security Bureau of Zhejiang Province 
assigned more than 300 policemen to investigate the case. 
  After a 17-day investigation, they apprehended the three 
suspects. In their search of the three men's houses, the police 
recovered U.S.$5,250 and 154,620 new Taiwan dollars, seven 
cameras, eight rings, one jade bracelet and two watches. 
  They also tracked down the instruments used to commit the 
crime, such as the motor boat, hunting guns and an empty fuel 
can. 
  Sources said that the property and money will be returned to 
the relatives of the deceased.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin this afternoon 
categorically ruled out the possibility of setting up an 
information service in Tibet, as proposed by the U.S. Congress. 
  In reply to inquiries about this during a news conference, 
Wu 
Jianmin said: Tibet is an inalienable part of China's 
territory. Whatever the U.S. side intends to do there must be 
approved by China. China certainly will not agree to such 
doings by the United States. (Note: This refers to the U.S. 
Congress' decision to set up an information service in Tibet, as 
mentioned by reporters.) 
  Wu Jianmin continued by saying: I would like to take this 
opportunity to point out that Tibet has been an inalienable part 
of China's territory since the 13th century, and no country in 
this world recognizes Tibet as an independent state, neither 
does the United States. 
  Wu Jianmin said: In the recently adopted U.S. foreign 
relations authorization law for the 1994/95 fiscal year, the 
U.S. Congress undisguisedly called Tibet a country. It has gone 
surprisingly far, indeed, in despising the basic norms governing 
international relations, flagrantly infringing on China's 
sovereignty, and attempting to split China. 
  Wu Jianmin stressed that the Chinese people had engaged in 
bloody struggle over a long period of time to safeguard their 
nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Without 
exception, all the plots throughout history which aimed at 
separating Tibet from China have ended in shameful failure. 
Anyone who intends to slip back into the old rut certainly will 
come to no good. China demands that the U.S. Government 
strictly abide by its stance on Tibet as a part of China; 
scrupulously observe the basic principles prescribed by the 
three joint communiques signed between China and the United 
States, as well as codes of international relations; and remedy 
the faults it has committed.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- At a news 
conference this afternoon, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu 
Jianmin urged the U.S. Government to "act cautiously and make a 
wise decision on the issue of most-favored-nation [MFN] status." 
  Wu Jianmin made those remarks when answering a relevant 
question raised by a reporter. 
  When asked by a reporter if China is worried about the 
United 
States' partial abolition of MFN treatment, involving -- for 
example -- sanctions against state-owned enterprises, Wu Jianmin 
reiterated that the awarding of the MFN status to each other by 
China and the United States is a reciprocal, mutually beneficial 
arrangement and a basis for normal trade interaction between the 
two countries. He pointed out: "Any move made by the U.S. side 
to sabotage this basis will cause serious consequences."

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- China appreciates the 
remarks made by U.S. President Clinton that his government is 
willing to make efforts to develop and improve U.S.-China 
relations, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today. 
  The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, was commenting on the remarks 
made 
by Clinton when he was answering a question from a correspondent 
of the Cable News Network (CNN) here this afternoon at a weekly 
press conference. 
  Wu said that the Chinese side has already made tremendous 
efforts to improve and develop relations between the two 
countries, and that it is willing, together with the U.S. side, 
to make continuous efforts to this end. 
  China and the United States are two influential world 
powers, 
and the development of stable and constructive relations between 
them conforms with the fundamental interests of the two 
countries and their peoples, and also serves to promote peace 
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and in the world at 
large, he said. 
  Wu said that there exists broad common interests between 
China and the United States, and there are also some differences 
between them on certain issues. 
  The spokesman stressed that what is important at present is 
that the two countries should develop their common points and 
handle their differences properly, in strict accordance with the 
basic principles laid down in the three Sino-U.S. joint 
communiques and on the basis of mutual respect, non-interference 
in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutually 
beneficial cooperation.

  [Text] Beijing, 4 May (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman made the following statement in reply to 
questions raised by JIJI [JIJI PRESS] and AP [ASSOCIATED PRESS] 
correspondents stationed in Beijing in connection with Japanese 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remark on 3 May that the 
"Nanjing Massacre was fabricated": 
  The war of aggression launched by Japanese militarists in 
China in the past inflicted grave calamities to the Chinese 
people, and the Nanjing massacre was one of the heinous crimes 
committed by Japanese militarists. The international community 
has long drawn a conclusion on the aggressive nature of Japan's 
war against China and the historical facts surrounding the 
Nanjing massacre. 
  To correctly deal with historical questions is an important 
political foundation for developing friendly and cooperative 
relations between China and Japan. The Chinese Government has 
all along advocated the needs to adopt a forward-looking 
attitude regarding unfortunate segments of history and to draw 
lessons from history in jointly developing friendly and 
cooperative ties in the future. Such are also the common 
understandings and stance of many Japanese government leaders. 
Many of them have even expressed apologies and repentance for 
Japanese aggression abroad during World War II. 
  It has been nearly a half century since the war was ended. 
Today, as Sino-Japanese relations are entering a new stage of 
development, we are shocked and indignant that a Japanese 
cabinet member has gone so far as to openly tamper with history 
and deny facts to defend the aggressive act committed by 
Japanese militarists. We hoped that the Japanese Government 
will proceed from the overall interests of safeguarding 
bilateral relations in seriously handling this question.

  [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- China is shocked by and 
indignant at a statement by the Japanese Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano yesterday that the massacre in Nanjing during the 
Second World War is "a fabrication", a Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said today. 
  In response to questions by Beijing-based foreign 
correspondents regarding the Justice minister's remarks, the 
spokesman said that the aggression against China launched by the 
Japanese militarists in the past caused great sufferings for the 
Chinese people and the massacre in Nanjing was one of the 
serious crimes committed by the Japanese militarists. 
  He continued that the international community long ago 
reached conclusions on the nature of the war and the historical 
facts of the massacre in Nanjing. 
  He pointed out that the rightful treatment of the issues in 
history is an important political basis of the development of 
Sino-Japanese friendly relations of cooperation. 
  The spokesman noted that the Chinese Government has all 
along 
adhered to the principle of adopting a forward-looking attitude 
in treating that sad part of history and drawing lessons from 
history, so as to jointly develop friendly relations of 
cooperation facing the future. The principle has been shared by 
many Japanese Government leaders and persons of insight, the 
said. 
  He added that some Japanese statesmen also made apologies 
and 
introspection in the cabinet over the Japanese aggression during 
the Second World War. 
  "Now that nearly 50 years have passed since the end of the 
war and Sino-Japanese relations have entered a new stage," he 
said, "a Japanese cabinet member went so far as to publicly 
distort the history, deny the historical facts and defend the 
Japanese militarists' aggression. We are shocked by and 
indignant at this." 
  The spokesman hoped that the Japanese Government will 
earnestly and seriously treat the issue with a view to safeguard 
bilateral relations.

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (AFP)--China expressed "shock and 
indignation" Thursday at a Japanese minister's assertion that 
the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication but stopped short of 
demanding an official apology from the new adminstration in 
Tokyo. Despite the obvious anger generated in China by Justice 
Minister Shiheto Nagano's remarks, analysts here said Beijing 
clearly wanted to avoid an emotive row with the government of 
Tsutomo Hata, who was only elected Japanese prime minister last 
month. 
  "A cabinet member of the Japanese Government has openly 
distorted history and denied the facts to justify the (1937-45) 
war of aggression and we feel shock and indignation at that," 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said. 
  Nagano, who was appointed justice minister by Hata last 
week, 
said in an interview published Wednesday in a major Japanese 
daily, that the Nanjing Massacre was a "fabrication" and that it 
was "wrong to describe the war as a war of aggression." 
According to a Japanese source, the number two at the Japanese 
embassy here, Koichi Matsumoto, was summoned to the Foreign 
Ministry Thursday morning. "The representation made to Matsumoto 
was in line with the comments made by the ministry spokesman," 
the source said, adding that the Chinese side had asked the 
Japanese government to "deal seriously" with the matter. 
  Japanese troops occupied the eastern city of Nanjing in 1937 
and slaughtered citizens and prisoners of war. According to the 
Chinese authorities, some 300,000 people died in the massacre. 
  Hata, currently on a European tour, publicly criticised 
Nagano's remarks on Wednesday, caling them "inappropriate." "My 
view on the past history is that our past actions, including 
aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and 
sorrow for many people," Hata said. 
  Asked if Hata's remarks had sufficiently mollified the 
Chinese side, spokesman Wu said only: "We have taken note of 
Prime Minister Hata's attitude towards the history-distorting 
statement... and he also thinks it is inappropriate for the 
minister of justice to make such remarks."

  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said today that Japan should adopt a correct 
attitude toward its part in history of aggression and continue 
to seek development through peace.

conference when commenting on Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu

  [Text] Beijing, 4 May (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said today that the Chinese Government and people wish 
to express their warm congratulations over South Africa's first 
successful general election and the victory the African National 
Congress [ANC] has won in the election. 
  Preliminary results of South Africa's first multiracial 
general election have been announced. The ANC, led by chairman 
Mandela, has won the election and South Africa will form a 
government of national solidarity dominated by the ANC. 
  The spokesman said: The vast number of black people in South 
Africa have exercised their democratic rights for the first time 
in history during the general election. The birth of a new 
South Africa with racial equality is the beginning of a new era 
in South Africa. This victory is the result of the protracted 
struggle which the South African people have launched with 
support from the international community. The ANC and other 
liberation organizations of black people have played their key 
roles in bringing about this historic change in South Africa. 
  The spokesman added: "We also appreciate the positive 
contributions which the government of the Nationalist Party 
headed by President de Klerk has made through carrying out 
reforms to conform to the trend of the times." 
  The spokesman said: The Chinese Government and people 
wholeheartedly hope that, under the leadership of the government 
of national solidarity of South Africa, all parties will work 
together with greater unity and cooperation in building a 
stable, democratic, prosperous, and affluent new South Africa 
enjoying racial equality. 
  The spokesman pointed out: The Chinese Government and people 
have always firmly supported the South African people's just 
struggle against racism, and we are delighted with the South 
African people's historical victory. After the founding of the 
new South African Government, China is ready to establish and 
develop friendly relations and cooperation with South Africa on 
the basis of the five principles for peaceful coexistence. The 
spokesman expressed the belief that the traditional friendship 
forged between the Chinese and South African peoples during the 
protracted struggle certainly will be consolidated and developed 
on a new basis.

  [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
and people expressed congratulations to South Africa on the 
smooth progress of its first all-race election and to the 
African National Congress (ANC) for its election victory, a 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today. 
  Preliminary election results show that the ANC, led by 
Nelson 
Mandela, has built an insurmountable lead, which indicates that 
South Africa will form a new government of national unity 
centered around the ANC. 
  The election has provided South African black people their 
first chance to exercise democratic rights in the history of 
South Africa, the spokesman noted. 
  The birth of a new South Africa where all races are equal 
marks a new epoch in the country, he said. 
  The victory is the result of the hard, long-time struggle of 
the South African people, supported by the international 
community. The ANC and other black liberation organizations 
have played a crucial role in propelling South Africa toward 
this historic change, he said. 
  "We appreciate the positive contributions made by the 
National Party led by F.W. de Klerk, in moving with the tides 
and implementing reforms," he said. 
  The Chinese Government and people sincerely hope that under 
the leadership of the government of national unity, all parties 
there will strengthen unity and cooperation and make joint 
efforts in the building up of a new South Africa enjoying racial 
equality, stability, democracy and prosperity, he said. 
  The Chinese Government and people have firmly supported the 
just struggle of the South African people against apartheid and 
are proud of the historic victory of the South African people, 
he noted. 
  "China is willing to establish and develop friendly ties of 
cooperation with the new South African Government on the basis 
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence," he stated. 
  He expressed the belief that the traditional friendship of 
the Chinese and South African peoples will be consolidated and 
developed on a new basis.

<F P=106> [Article by Chen Shao-pin (7115 0783 6333): "Liu Huaqing </F>
Says China Will Oppose Hegemonism and Will Not Seek Hegemony"] 
  [Text] According to information from Beijing, at Beijing's 
Jingxi Hotel on 8 April, a number of leaders of the CPC Central 
Military Committee received outstanding officers and men from 
the three military services, as well as experts who had made 
inventions and creations on the national defense science, 
technology, and industry front. Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of 
the Central Military Commission and standing committee member of 
the CPC Political Bureau, made a speech on behalf of the CPC 
central leading body and the Central Military Commission. 
  Liu's speech emphasized two main points: First, accelerating 
the development of modern weaponry by relying mainly on China's 
own strength, and second, opposing hegemonism and power politics 
and promoting the establishment of the new international 
political and economic order. 
  Liu Huaqing said: Along with the increase in our economic 
strength, we must accelerate the modernization of the armed 
forces. Relying mainly on our own efforts, we should develop a 
number of deterrent weapons for the ground, naval, and air 
forces, including some modern weapons that even the Western 
countries do not possess. Our purpose is to defend ourselves 
more effectively, to resist the military threats from 
hegemonism, and to guarantee our socialist construction and our 
people's peaceful lives and work. Liu added: The experience of 
the Chinese people shows that a nation's independence is most 
valuable, but China will not be able to stand firm without the 
backing of modern military strength and may be bullied and 
pressured by hegemonism. China will always stand on the side of 
the Third World, and will never seek hegemony or world 
leadership [bu dang tou 0008 3981 7333]. However, we will play 
our role as we should in international affairs, and will 
actively promote the establishment of a new international 
political and economic order. We fear no one; neither will we 
offend anyone. First, we do not fear the interference of U.S. 
hegemonism and power politics in our internal affairs, and do 
not fear its intimidation [e zha 6073 6094] and sanctions. 
China will never yield to the hegemonist practice of the United 
States. Since its founding, the PRC -- growing from weakness to 
strength -- has never been daunted by any military threats, 
sanctions, isolation, or subversive plots, and has never 
bartered away its state sovereignty and national dignity in the 
face of hegemonism and power politics. 
  Liu Huaqing said: The whole Army is well aware that state 
sovereignty and national security are always of primary 
importance for us. U.S. hegemonism now takes China as its main 
enemy, and tries to interfere in China's internal affairs. Who 
has given them such power? Have the Chinese people and the 
Chinese People's Liberation Army ever yielded to hegemonism at 
any time? Hegemonism acts simply on the basis of its 
comparatively greater national and military strength. Today, 
however, in the 1990's, China has learned how to deal with the 
intimidation, bullying pressure, subversive attempts, and 
challenges from hegemonism and power politics. 
  Liu Huaqing further stated: The leaders of our party and 
state -- Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Vice Premier Qian 
Qichen -- have given explicit and firm messages to the United 
States: China will never tolerate foreign interference in its 
internal affairs and will never barter away its principles. 
China will not seek confrontation, but will not fear 
confrontation and will not evade any imposed confrontation. If 
the United States severs relations with China, China still will 
be able to develop further. 
  It also was said that Jiang Zemin, chairman of the CPC 
Central Military Commission, had issued orders to commend 58 
military and national defense scientific research and production 
units, as well as more than 250 individuals in the military and 
national defense scientific research units, who had made 
contributions to the successful development of some modern 
military equipment, 38 of which reached the contemporary 
advanced level in the world. Ten types of weapons were the most 
advanced in the world.

  [Text] Nice, France, May 4 (XINHUA) -- China has expressed 
reservation about linking policy issues to a capital increase of 
the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Chinese delegation to the 
ADB's 27th annual meeting said here today. 
  The vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, Zhou 
Zhengqing, heading his country's delegation to the ADB's annual 
board of governors meeting in Nice, outlined China's views on 
the bank's program and policies in the 1990s. 
  Zhou said that his government has always actively supported 
the ADB's capital increase and made unremitting efforts for its 
fourth general capital increase. 
  But China "has to express great regret over plans to link 
policy consideration to capital increase" which were raised 
during the ADB's recent talks, he added. 
  Zhou believed that as economic backwardness is the 
fundamental cause of poverty, environmental problems and sexual 
discrimination in the developing countries, the ADB should make 
economic development a top priority and gradually furnish these 
countries with the resources and capabilities to resolve these 
issues. 
  "Rigidly linking projects to solutions of some social 
problems is detrimental to supporting the economic growth of the 
ADB's member countries and eventually harmful to social 
progress," said Zhou. 
  Pointing out that China appreciates the ADB's efforts to 
improve the quality of loan projects, he noted that the key lies 
in increased cooperation between the ADB and those countries 
offered loans. 
  He declared that China would, as always, strengthen 
cooperation with the ADB and learn from other states who had 
loans from the bank. 
  "China also appreciates the ADB's efforts to push the 
economic development and social progress of its member 
countries," said Zhou. 
  However, he called for the ADB to heed the specific 
situations of its members in promoting its policies and 
strategies on poverty alleviation, environmental protection, 
raising women's status, populations and protecting forests. 
  He said that the ADB's policies and strategies in the above 
fields should be sufficiently adaptable and flexible and be easy 
to accept and implement. 
  Zhou also called on the ADB to make greater contributions to 
the economic boom and social development of the Asian-Pacific 
region. 
  In the last few years, he explained, loans and technical 
assistance from the ADB had supported China's reform, its 
opening up to the outside world and economic development, thus 
helping to ease the restrictions on China's economy from 
bottlenecks like energy, transportation and communication. 
  He said that with the global economy growing at a slow pace 
in the past year, the economic growth in the Asian-Pacific 
region had maintained a high speed increase of seven percent, 
accelerating global economic recovery and development. 
  "This is mainly a result of the reform, structural 
readjustment and open economic policies promoted by the 
Asian-Pacific countries and regions based on their own 
situations," he added. 
  The ADB's three-day meeting, which began yesterday, is 
scheduled to focus discussion on how to improve ADB-funded 
projects and properly handle the relationship between economic 
growth and social issues. 
  Founded in 1966 the ADB is a governmental international 
financial organization aimed at promoting Asian-Pacific economic 
development and cooperation. 
  So far, it has provided loans totaling 47.7 billion dollars 
for 1,179 projects.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 3 May (XINHUA)--That the political and 
economic ad hoc groups of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] Preparatory 
Committee have met for the first time in Hong Kong has become a 
topic of common concern among the Hong Kong people. The XINHUA 
News Agency Hong Kong branch invited approximately 500 public 
figures to attend a function tonight to extend a warm welcome to 
the PWC Vice Chairman Lu Ping and other mainland China PWC 
members who have made a special trip to Hong Kong to attend the 
ad hoc group meetings. 
  Zhou Nan, director of XINHUA's Hong Kong branch, addressed 
the reception, which was held on the 50th floor of the China 
Resources Building. He said that these ad hoc meetings have 
important significance. PWC members will take this opportunity 
to meet public figures from all walks of life in the Hong Kong 
community as well as the local people and will discuss with them 
matters of vital importance concerning Hong Kong's steady 
transition, stability, and prosperity. Zhou Nan stressed that 
the meetings seek to improve communication with all sectors of 
the Hong Kong community, to meet with grass-roots 
representatives from all social strata and geographic areas, and 
to widely solicit opinions on issues related to the preparations 
for the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR. 
  Zhou Nan said: In order to preserve long-term stability and 
prosperity in Hong Kong, one must closely rely on the vast 
number of Hong Kong people who love this country and Hong Kong, 
as well as on other members of the local public. One must do a 
solid job in preparing for the establishment of the Hong Kong 
SAR in all areas. To this end, he and all other PWC members 
alike sincerely and eagerly hope that Hong Kong people from all 
walks of life will show concern for and play a part in this task 
and will contribute and pool together their wisdom, talents, and 
efforts, thus making new contributions to achieving a smooth 
transition and to preserving Hong Kong's long-term stability and 
prosperity. 
  Henry Fok, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference National Committee, was present at 
today's reception.

on the Basic Law and the relevant decisions made by the National 
People's Congress and should reflect principles concerning 
national sovereignty and smooth transition. 
  This was the first meeting of the PWC's political affairs 
group since the PWC was founded last July. The two-day meeting 
was concluded early this evening. 
  Liang Zhenying, a leader of the political affairs group, 
said 
to this reporter: At this meeting, we concentrated on further 
discussions on the election and formation of the first 
legislative council of the future Hong Kong SAR and related 
issues. The participating members reached agreement on the 
principles concerning the formation of the first legislative 
council. He said: The formation of the first legislative 
council should reflect the executive-led principle; the 
principle that the executive and legislative organs should 
cooperate with each other and balance and check each other, with 
the emphasis on cooperation; the principle of balanced 
participation by people from all strata in Hong Kong society; 
and the principle of developing democracy in an orderly and 
gradual process. All these are guiding principles. 
  Liang Zhenying said: As to several specific arrangements, 
the members also reached a consensus. These arrangements 
include: That the voting age in elections should be lowered to 
18 and that, in terms of the functional constituency elections, 
the existing methods of functional constituency elections that 
have proved effective, as well as the current practices and 
principles, shall be retained. 
  Xiao Weiyun, another leader of the political affairs group, 
added: At the meeting, we also discussed the current situation 
and, in particular, analyzed the report presented recently by 
the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons of 
the British Parliament. The members' views can be summarized 
into the following two points: 1) Many of the things mentioned 
in the report are inconsistent with the facts; 2) the report 
reflects some change in the British Hong Kong authorities' 
attitude and policy toward the Basic Law. Many members took 
part in the drafting of the Basic Law and are very aware of 
where the report does not agree with the Basic Law. 
  He revealed that the political affairs group will hold 
another meeting in Beijing in June to discuss the report of the 
third meeting of the PWC and the arrangements for work in the 
second half of this year.

  [Text] The Beijing-appointed panel overseeing Hong Kong's 
transitional matters has ruled out the single-seat, single-vote 
system for the 1997 Legislative Council [Legco] direct 
elections. The Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) political 
sub-group prefers either a multi-seat, single-vote system, or 
proportional representation. 
  The Legislative Council has already enacted legislation to 
introduce a single-seat, single-vote system for the 1994/95 
district board municipal council and Legco polls. A revised 
report by the political sub-group will be tabled to the third 
plenary meeting of the PWC in July. 
  PWC member Professor Lau Siu-kai said scrapping the 
single-seat, single-vote system would not create great shock in 
the community. "The impact on society will be limited," he said. 
"Even if we adopt a different voting method, it will only have 
a limited effect on the result of the elections." 
  Professor Lau said China had always voiced opposition to the 
single-seat, single-vote method, but the PWC would try to gauge 
public opinion on the issue. 
  Another departure from the 1995 model will be the line-up 
for 
the nine new functional constituency seats. Hong Kong 
co-convenor of the political subgroup, Leung Chun-ying, said 
members agreed that the nine new seats should be created with a 
franchise similar to the existing functional seats. 
  Members also agreed to lowering the voting age from 21 to 
18, 
Mr. Leung said. 
  Another contentious issue was how to cope with the 
legislative vacuum following the disbanding and re-organisation 
of the legislature upon the change of sovereignty, according to 
Professor Lau. Members felt that it could be resolved either by 
forming a provisional lawmaking assembly or delegating the power 
to the chief executive, he said. 
  Ending a two-day session in Hong Kong, mainland members of 
the political sub-group will meet political parties in the local 
Xinhua (New China News Agency) Wan Chai headquarters today and 
tomorrow. 
  Meanwhile, Senior Executive Councillor Lady Dunn yesterday 
stressed that Hong Kong would remain under British rule until 
mid- 1997 despite the presence of the PWC in the territory. 
Speaking after yesterday's Executive Council meeting, Lady Dunn 
said: "It is clearly stated in the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration that Britain will rule Hong Kong until June 30 1997. 
I firmly believe that both the British and Chinese governments 
will uphold the Joint Declaration." 
  She said the PWC, which China claimed was only an advisory 
body, posed no threat to the Government. "The PWC is only an 
advisory body but not a power organ. Where they hold their 
meetings is no big deal. Given the fact that there are Hong 
Kong and mainland members, it is easy to understand why they 
want to meet in Hong Kong," she said.

<F P=106> [Report: "Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee Meets for </F>
First Time in Hong Kong; Lu Ping Presides Over Political Affairs 
Group Meeting"] 
  [Text] Yesterday (2 May), the Political and Economic 
Affairs Group of the Preliminary Working Committee of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region [SAR] began a four-day meeting in Hong Kong. 
  The Political Affairs Group had its first session yesterday, 
and it discussed the establishment of a SAR representative 
office on the mainland. Members also discussed a report by the 
British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 
Sino-British relations. Lu Ping, deputy chairman and secretary 
general of the Preliminary Working Committee, and relevant 
mainland members came to Hong Kong specially to attend the 
meeting. 
  The meeting was chaired by Lu Ping. Leung Chan-ying, leader 
of the Hong Kong side on the Political Affairs Group, described 
the group's first meeting in Hong Kong as having a good 
atmosphere and high efficiency. 
  Yesterday's meeting of the Political Affairs Group was held 
at XINHUA Hong Kong Branch's villa in Stanley. After the 
meeting, the two leaders briefed the press about their meeting. 
Xiao Weiyun, the Chinese side's team leader, said that as 
usual, the meeting had assessed the current situation. In 
addition, the group also discussed the establishment of the Hong 
Kong SAR's representative office in Beijing and reviewed issues 
mentioned in previous meetings in order to draft a work report 
for submission to the third plenary meeting of the Preliminary 
Working Committee. The group will continue to discuss these 
issues today. 
  Leung Chan-ying said that Article 22 of the Basic Law 
specifies the relationship between the Hong Kong SAR and the 
central and local governments, and the provision mentions that 
the SAR Government may set up a representative office in 
Beijing; at the same time, various central departments and 
various provinces or localities may also set up representative 
offices in Hong Kong. However, the discussion remains at an 
initial stage, and the final answer will be found in one to two 
years. 
  He added: Concrete operational forms to be further 
considered include future connections between the various 
departments of the SAR government and the central government. 
Will such connections be built between specific departments 
directly or effected through a unified channel? What will the 
rank of the representative office and its personnel be, and when 
is the right time to set up such an office? This will have 
close a relationship with the establishment of the SAR in the 
initial stage. He pointed out: In the future, the relationship 
between the SAR and the central government will not only be 
limited to the appointment of officials and certain political 
decisions; many economic issues will also be involved. For 
example, civilian aviation is one such issue. The handling of 
many affairs requires a close relationship between the SAR and 
the central government. However, the details have yet to be 
considered further. 
  Before the meeting, no member spoke to the press. Reporters 
were divided into two groups. One group were reporters from the 
electronic media, and the other were press reporters. They were 
allowed into the meeting room to take photographs for five 
minutes. 
  During the photo-session, some reporters asked Lu Ping why 
he 
did not talk with people on the spot in coming to Hong Kong, 
when he would speak publicly to Hong Kong people, and whether 
his refusal to meet the Hong Kong governor was against the 
Memorandum of Understanding on the airport. Lu Ping just smiled 
and did not say anything.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Civil servants now 
working for the Hong Kong Government may stay at their posts 
after 1997 in accordance with the Basic Law, said a high-ranking 
Chinese official here today. The official said that the 
Chinese side will firmly abide by the Basic Law provision 
regarding the issue, urging civil servants of the present local 
government to serve the Hong Kong people before and after 1997. 
Wang Fengchao, a member of the Political Affairs Panel of the 
Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee for 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), made the 
remarks after holding talks with two political parties in the 
territory. The political affairs panel of the Preliminary 
Working Committee (PWC) held separate talks here this morning 
with the Liberal Party of Hong Kong and the Liberal Democratic 
Federation of Hong Kong in order to solicit their opinions on 
PWC's work. Wang said that the Basic Law has clearly 
stipulated that civil servants in Hong Kong may stay at their 
posts after 1997, adding that they do not have to state their 
political stand. He said that if there were some servants who 
wanted to quit their jobs, they should make a notice in advance 
according to the present practices so that others could be 
arranged to replace them to fill the vacancy. Wang said that 
the Basic Law has also clearly stipulated that the senior 
officials in the future government of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region shall be nominated by the chief executive 
and appointed by the central government of China. Therefore, 
he continued that there does not exist the consultation with the 
British side in appointment of the senior officials in the 
future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
