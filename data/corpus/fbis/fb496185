  [Text] Hong Kong, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The political affairs 
panel of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) for the 
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) held talks here today with two political parties in 
the territory. During the separate talks held this morning, 
the political affairs panel solicited the opinions and 
suggestions from the two political parties on the work of the 
PWC. The two political parties are the Liberal Party of Hong 
Kong and the Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong. The 
two political groups voiced their views on a variety of issues 
concerning the political structure in Hong Kong after 1997. 
Issues touched upon during the talks included the stability of 
the civil servants and the formation of the first Legislative 
Council of the future SAR. They also made a number of 
enlightening suggestions to the PWC's political affairs panel. 
Wang Fengchao, a member of the political affairs panel, said 
after the talks that the views and suggestions put forward by 
the two political parties are very useful for the work of the 
PWC's political affairs panel, adding that PWC will take a 
serious study of them.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The political affairs 
panel for the Preliminary Working Committee for Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region (SAR) today held talks with 
representatives from the Democratic Alliance for Betterment of 
Hong Kong and Hong Kong Progressive Alliance. 
  The panel listened to their opinions and suggestions on the 
current political structure in Hong Kong and on the work of the 
committee. 
  Xiao Weiyun, head of the Chinese (mainland) side at the 
panel, told the press after the talks that the panel will make 
in-depth study of their opinions and suggestions. 
  He noted that the current three-tier political structure in 
Hong Kong will be terminated and re-organized after July 1, 
1997. These are two different matters and there is no way that 
one tier needs re-organization while two others need not, he 
said. 
  He said the SAR government and the first SAR Legislative 
Council will be set up after 1997 according to the Basic Law and 
relevant regulations of the Chinese National People's Congress 
so as to ensure a smooth transfer of power and maintain social 
stability and economic prosperity in Hong Kong. 
  "It is just in line with this spirit that our panel is 
holding discussions on various kinds of work," Xiao said. 
  Although the Sino-British talks on the political structure 
have broke down, Xiao said, the Chinese side hopes to continue 
cooperation with Britain in the fields of economy, culture and 
education. 
  He stressed that the guarantee for the smooth transition and 
maintenance of prosperity and stability is the Basic Law and 
Hong Kong residents' wish for such a transition. 
  Xiao said his panel will strive to implement the spirit of 
the Basic Law. 
  The two political organizations wished the preliminary 
committee strengthen communication with Hong Kong residents, 
Xiao said. 
  "We deem this opinion is right and will hand it over to the 
committee for discussion," he added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The meeting of the 
economic affairs panel of the Preliminary Working Committee for 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) ended here 
today after two days of practical discussions. 
  Coordination between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland on 
major infrastructure projects in the territory was the focus of 
today's discussions. 
  Panel members believed that following the economic 
development, contacts between Hong Kong and the mainland are on 
the rise and construction of major projects, including those of 
railway, aviation, highway and port, are directly linked with 
economic progress of the two places. 
  Thus, they said, further communication and coordination 
between the two parties is needed for this important and urgent 
issue. And the aim of the coordination is to promote the 
economic development of the mainland and Hong Kong. 
  The members said the infrastructure is beneficial to both 
sides and coordination is needed in both planning and 
organization. They suggest a high-level coordination group be 
set up. 
  On land fund, leaders of the panel reiterated that the fund 
belongs to the future SAR government which will then manage it. 
No other person should have the right to interfere in this 
matter. 
  During the meeting, the panel also reviewed its work in the 
past six months.

<F P=106> [By Wing Kay Po] </F>
  [Text] Legislators last night abandoned party rivalries to 
register an unprecedented vote of no confidence in the British 
and Chinese governments. In a rare show of unity, the Liberal 
Party gave its backing to a motion initiated by the United 
Democrats leader, Martin Lee, attacking the current and incoming 
sovereign powers for violating the Joint Declaration -- the 
agreement under which Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. 
Lee's motion was passed without opposition -- by 23 votes, but 
three government officials and a maverick legislator, Chim 
Pui-chung, abstained. Other members were absent. 
  Lee accused China of interfering in Hong Kong affairs ahead 
of 1997 and said Britain was "joining hands" with China in 
violating the Joint Declaration, signed in 1984. The leader of 
the Liberal Party, Allen Lee, said he did not believe Britain 
and China "deliberately went back on their word" to uphold the 
Joint Declaration, but he charged them with abandoning their 
promises to co-operate to achieve a smooth transition. 
  Martin Lee said the motion amounted to a vote of no 
confidence in the two powers. "My motion is effectively a vote 
of no confidence aimed at both Britain and China," Lee said 
outside the chamber. "It shows a profound concern among 
legislative councillors that Britain and China will not adhere 
to their obligations under the Joint Declaration." 
  During the debate his colleague, Szeto Wah, said: "We have 
reason to believe that the British and Chinese sides have ganged 
up to destroy the spirit of the Joint Declaration. We are being 
betrayed." Martin Lee said the Joint Declaration seems to have 
become "a declaration of joint destruction". He listed 10 
"incidents of violations of the Joint Declaration". Among them 
were the seven diplomatic letters exchanged between Britain and 
China in 1990 which showed a joint attempt to slow democratic 
development. He also quoted a secret Sino-British agreement on 
the composition of the Court of Final Appeal as an example of 
Britain's complicity in violating the Joint Declaration. 
  Martin Lee said the Basic Law, announced in 1990, violated 
the Joint Declaration, without protest from Britain. "If we 
don't defend the spirit of the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong will 
be ruled by a puppet regime from the north," Martin Lee said. 
  Christine Loh, an independent legislator, said Britain 
seemed 
resigned to letting China "re-interpret and redefine" the Joint 
Declaration. "Britain seems to take the view that it will have 
vacated Hong Kong by 1997, so that whatever happens here is not 
Britain's responsibility," she said. 
  The Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng, said 
it was "plainly untrue" that the Hong Kong-British government 
had failed to abide by the objectives of the Joint Declaration. 
Ng rejected criticisms that the government betrayed the 
aspirations of Hong Kong people for a legislature of more 
directly-elected seats. 
  "As a responsible government we have to strike the right 
balance between the expressed desire of the community for a 
greater say in running their own affairs on the one hand, and a 
form of government capable of transcending 1997. I believe 
we've struck the right balance," he said. Ng also defended the 
secret Sino-British agreement on the Court of Final Appeal.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Speaks on China's Consistent </F>
Implementation of the `One Country, Two Systems' Policy; Views 
Solution to the New Airport Issue"] 
  [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY Hong Kong Branch, yesterday said that there have been 
some contacts recently between China and Britain on the new 
airport issue. Some views are getting closer but it is hard to 
say if a final agreement can be reached, he added. In addition, 
he pointed out that China has never changed in implementing the 
"one country, two systems" policy; "one country, two systems" is 
a Chinese Government affair and China's policy and has nothing 
to do with the British side. 
  Zhang Junsheng made these remarks when asked by a reporter 
during a seminar to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the May 
4th Movement yesterday. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: How will the specific problems 
concerning the new airport be resolved? We will know this after 
the Provisional Airport Authority holds a meeting. But we can 
say that there have been some contacts recently between China 
and Britain on questions concerning the airport. Some views are 
getting closer to each other but it is still unclear if a final 
agreement can be reached. In other words, it is still unclear 
whether or not the program proposed by the British side will 
completely correspond with the Memorandum of Understanding on 
the new airport. 
  One reporter asked: "During a Legislative Council meeting, 
some legislative councilors raised a suggestion urging the 
Chinese and British Governments to earnestly implement the 'one 
country, two systems' policy. What is your opinion on this?" 
  Zhang Junsheng answered: "One country, two systems" is a 
policy proposed by the Chinese Government to resolve the Hong 
Kong issue; the principles and policies contained in the Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law have very explicitly established 
"one country, two systems." 
  He continued: "On China's part, the implementation of the 
'one country, two systems' policy has never been a problem. It 
has been nine years since the formal signing of the Joint 
Declaration and our principles and policies on Hong Kong have 
been arranged in accordance with the 'one country, two systems' 
formula. 'One country, two systems' is an affair of the Chinese 
Government affair and China's policy. How can the British 
exercise `one country, two systems'?"

<F P=106> [By Jason Gagliardi] </F>
  [Text] A family of five North Korean defectors spent 
almost two weeks in Hong Kong after an arduous journey across 
China before flying to a new life in Seoul at the weekend. 
  Ryo Man Chol, 48, a former police officer from Hamhung 
province, his wife and three children, were kept at a secret 
location in Hong Kong while applying for political asylum in 
South Korea. 
  The South Korean consulate is refusing to release details of 
where the family stayed in Hong Kong and it is not known how 
they managed to elude Chinese authorities for weeks while 
travelling by train from northern China to Hong Kong. 
  The Hong Kong government is not commenting on the Ryo 
family's ordeal, fearing that they could be the first trickle in 
a potential flood of refugees from hardship-stricken North Korea 
entering the territory via China. 
  A Security Branch spokesman said: "We cannot give out 
information on this sort of case because it is very sensitive 
and involves other countries." 
  The spokesman refused to detail how the Ryo family entered 
Hong Kong, saying the Government did not want to publicise how 
it was done for fear of encouraging other defectors -- including 
thousands already thought to be living in China -- to make Hong 
Kong a pipeline to a fresh start in South Korea. 
  At a press conference in Seoul yesterday, the Ryo family 
told 
of how they decided it was better to risk being killed while 
escaping than face slow starvation at home. 
  A spokesman for South Korea's National Security Planning 
Agency told Eastern Express that agency officers had spent the 
past two days questioning the Ryos to establish that they were 
genuine defectors and not spies. 
  Ryo said an ethnic Korean named Kim who helped them on 
arriving in China first suggested they go for help to the South 
Korean embassy in Beijing. 
  Deciding Beijing was too dangerous they fled into northern 
China across the frozen Yalu River and went to Shenyang, where 
they met Kim, before moving south by train. 
  Ryo, who said he was sacked from the police force for taking 
a bribe over a traffic violation, had been listening to banned 
South Korean broadcasts for several months before deciding to 
defect. 
  The family decided to steal across the river on the pretext 
of gathering food. Ryo's daughter Gum Ju, 20, and one of his 
sons, Gum Ryong, 18, went first to make sure the ice would hold. 
They made it and on March 16, sent a telegram saying all was 
well. Ryo, his wife, Li Ok Gum, 45, and their other son, Un 
Ryong, 16, followed. 
  Li, 45, a kindergarten teacher, cried as she told how her 
family had been forced to subsist on corn and pine-bark porridge 
since last August, when food rations ran out. 
  "We were so hungry that I had to go to the countryside and 
beg for grains," she said. 
  Ryo said revolution was imminent because the Kim Il Sung 
regime was unable to feed its people. 
  His account matches the tales of other northern defectors 
but 
has met with scepticism from some analysts in Seoul, who say the 
South has its own propaganda agenda. 
  Visitors to Pyongyang say they have not noticed food 
shortages. However, its government has admitted to "economic 
problems".

<F P=106> [Interview with Wang Qiren, chairman of the board of the </F>
Bank of China, by unidentified RENMIN RIBAO reporter; date, 
place not given: "Striving for Steady Development of Hong 
Kong's Banking Business -- Wang Qiren, Chairman of the Board of 
the Bank of China, Answers Staff Reporter's Questions on 
Issuance of Hong Kong Banknotes in Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] [RENMIN RIBAO] Please talk about the preparations 
for the Bank of China's [BOC] participation in issuing Hong Kong 
banknotes. 
  [Wang Qiren] The Hong Kong Branch of the BOC will issue Hong 
Kong banknotes in Hong Kong on 2 May this year. This is a major 
event in the history of the development of the BOC and is also a 
grand occasion in the issuance of Hong Kong banknotes. The 
BOC's preparations for its participation in issuing Hong Kong 
banknotes began in September 1992. It took 20 months to design 
the banknotes, complete the legal procedures, and print and 
issue the notes. During this period, the relevant Hong Kong and 
mainland departments assisted us effectively, and Hong Kong 
citizens also supported us. This enabled the preparatory work to 
proceed smoothly. Here, on behalf of the BOC and through your 
newspaper, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the 
relevant departments and friends who showed their concern for 
and supported the BOC's issuance of Hong Kong banknotes in Hong 
Kong. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] What are the main characteristics of the Hong 
Kong banknotes issued by the BOC? 
  [Wang] There are five face values. The design is based on 
Hong Kong scenery. The obverse is the BOC Building, accompanied 
by Eastern flowers and plants; the reverse depicts some unique 
Hong Kong buildings and scenery. With this design, we would 
like to portray Hong Kong's position as an international 
monetary, trade, tourist, and shipping center; to display Hong 
Kong's vigorous economic life and its style and features; and 
also to express our wish for common development and prosperity 
between the BOC and Hong Kong. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] As far as I know, a bank must conform with 
some strict conditions if it wants to become a note-issuing 
bank. What conditions and basis does the BOC possess? 
  [Wang] For a long period of time, the BOC Group in Hong Kong 
has abided by the principle of "basing itself in Hong Kong and 
serving Hong Kong." It has actively developed its business, 
loyally served its citizens, and supported local industrial and 
commercial development, thus enjoying the citizens' trust. In 
addition, it also has made marked development in all vocational 
fields. Last year, deposits in the BOC increased by 30 times 
over 1978 and the loans released increased by 46 times. Its 
commercial banking business also has developed rapidly. By the 
end of 1993, BOC assets amounted to 700 billion Hong Kong 
dollars; it had more than 350 branches on Hong Kong Island, as 
well as in Kowloon and the New Territories; and their employees 
numbered 18,000; making it one of the important monetary groups 
in Hong Kong. In the course of its development and growth, the 
BOC has regarded performing social duties and supporting public 
welfare activities as its unshirkable responsibility; has done 
its best for the steady and healthy development of Hong Kong's 
banking business; and has taken an active part in all kinds of 
activities that promote social progress. The BOC has always 
regarded preserving Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and 
maintaining its position as an international monetary center, as 
being where its fundamental interests lie. We may well say that 
the BOC's rich financial resources, steady style, and 
distinguished reputation are the basic conditions that have made 
us a note-issuing bank. These also serve as the basis for the 
Hong Kong citizens and people in all circles to trust the BOC to 
issue banknotes. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] What was the background for the BOC to 
participate in issuing banknotes? 
  [Wang] The BOC's participation in issuing Hong Kong 
banknotes 
before 1997 is the manifestation of our full confidence in Hong 
Kong's future. We are happy to see that the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law have resolved Hong Kong's future 
in a satisfactory way, under the principle of "one country, two 
systems" and "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong." In the 
economic field, China's reform and opening up in the last 15 
years have promoted sustained economic growth on the mainland. 
This has brought about many new development opportunities for 
Hong Kong's economy and has promoted economic links and 
cooperative relations between Hong Kong and the mainland. Now 
the "China factor" has become an important one for Hong Kong's 
economic development. In the future, China's economy can be 
expected to maintain rapid growth rates of 8 to 9 percent, and 
Hong Kong's economy will benefit from this for a long time. 
This will lay a reliable foundation for Hong Kong's post-1997 
prosperity and stability. Under these circumstances, the BOC 
has participated in issuing Hong Kong banknotes. Together with 
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Standard 
Chartered Bank, it will play a positive role in maintaining 
monetary stability. This also corresponds with the good wishes 
of people of various circles in Hong Kong. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] As requested by the existing arrangements, 
before issuing Hong Kong banknotes, the issuing bank should 
submit U.S. dollars to the foreign exchange fund to obtain a 
noninterest liabilities certificate as a preparation for issuing 
banknotes. This arrangement has made it impossible for the 
issuing bank to gain any profit from issuing banknotes. This 
being the case, as a commercial bank, how does the BOC view the 
significance of its participation in issuing Hong Kong banknotes? 
  [Wang] As you have said, under the existing arrangements, 
the 
BOC cannot derive any commercial benefit from issuing banknotes. 
Instead, it will have to bear the operational cost for issuing 
banknotes and undertake the risk of foreign exchange losses 
owing to fluctuations in the Hong Kong dollar. We participate 
in issuing banknotes out of consideration for the overall 
situation and with the fundamental target of helping to maintain 
Hong Kong's monetary stability. In the past, the BOC has played 
a positive role in cooperating with the Hong Kong Government's 
monetary management authorities in ensuring the steady operation 
and healthy development of the monetary system. After becoming 
a note-issuing bank, the BOC will help strengthen the Hong Kong 
money market. This will be beneficial to the prosperity and 
stability of Hong Kong banks and monetary business, to the 
consolidation and enhancement of Hong Kong's position as an 
international monetary center, and to a steady transition toward 
1997. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] As a note-issuing bank, will the BOC's 
relations with other banks in Hong Kong change? 
  [Wang] No. After becoming a note-issuing bank, the BOC will 
continue in its operations to abide strictly by Hong Kong's 
monetary laws and will continue to support the position of the 
Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Standard 
Chartered Bank as the main issuing banks in Hong Kong. As in 
the past and at present, we will be willing to engage in fair 
competition with Hong Kong- and foreign-funded banks in Hong 
Kong, to develop together, to cooperate with each other, and to 
create common prosperity. 
  [RENMIN RIBAO] After participating in issuing Hong Kong 
banknotes, what is your bank's great plan for development? 
  [Wang] The BOC's participation in issuing banknotes means 
that our social responsibility has become heavier. In the 
future, our bank will continue to display its strong points, 
advance with an enterprising spirit, carry out careful 
operations, and strengthen our service. As always, together 
with the other two issuing banks, we will make new contributions 
to the stability and development of the Hong Kong monetary 
system.

<F P=106> ["Feature" by Zhang Qi: "HK People Respond Warmly to New </F>
Banknotes"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The new banknotes, 
issued by the Bank of China (BOC) for the first time in Hong 
Kong [HK], together with the souvenirs to commemorate the 
historic event, have caused a frenzy among local residents in 
the territory. 
  On May 2, the first day when the new currency was put into 
circulation in the territory, more than 40,000 local residents 
had reportedly turned up in front of BOC's central headquarters 
and its 31 branches and 44 automatic teller machines throughout 
the territory in order to obtain the new banknotes. 
  "Some even stayed overnight outside our bank in order to get 
the new banknotes," said a clerk of a BOC's branch in Wanchai 
district. 
  A 63-old man, named Chan Cheung, had to dash back home to 
get 
more money as he did not bring enough with him. 
  He said, "I was late. But I was lucky and managed to join 
the last few customers in the queue to get a set of the new 
notes. I am fortunate that I live near the bank". 
  Not all people are as fortunate as Chan. Many felt 
disappointed as they were not able to get the new banknotes 
owing to the long queues. 
  At least 65.2 million Hong Kong dollars worth of new 
banknotes issued by BOC was withdrawn on the first day, said an 
official with BOC. 
  Besides, a total of 70,000 MTR [mass transit railway] 
tickets 
designed to commemorate the launch of the new banknotes, each at 
a price of 30 H.K. [Hong Kong] dollars, were sold out within 
just one hour at BOC's 31 branches yesterday. 
  Meanwhile, the 20,000 souvenir covers and postmarks were 
snapped up as hundreds of people queued up outside the general 
post office in central early yesterday and rushed in to buy the 
covers each worth of five H.K. dollars [as received]. 
  Another 130,000 commemorative MTR tickets with an encoded 
value of 20 H.K. dollars (2.5 U.S. dollars) each, had reportedly 
sold out at eight MTR counters on the first day of issue on 
Sunday [1 May]. 
  An official from the bank said that 100,000 H.K. dollars 
(13,000 U.S. dollars) raised from the sale would be donated to 
charity. 
  The banknotes initially issued by the Bank of China totalled 
3 billion H.K. dollars (385 million U.S. dollars) in value, 
which accounted for four percent of Hong Kong dollar banknotes 
in circulation. 
  By issuing the banknotes in Hong Kong, the Bank of China has 
become the third bank to issue currency in the territory. The 
other two banks are the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp and 
Standard Chartered Bank. 
  Analysts here said that the Bank of China's participation in 
the issue of Hong Kong dollar notes indicated the bank's 
commitment to the Hong Kong community for a smooth transition of 
Hong Kong's monetary system and for maintaining its stability 
and prosperity.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Analysis" page by Andy Ho: "Lu Ping </F>
Misses Chance To Win Over HK People"] 
  [Text] The recent showing off of the Red One Company, Bank 
of China's issuing of new banknotes, and Mr Lu Ping's current 
visit to Hong Kong could all have underlined China's growing 
intimacy with the territory. These events, however, have turned 
out to be a public relations fiasco for Beijing and failed to 
score any political points in the tussle with the British to win 
the hearts of the Hong Kong people. 
  Mr Lu, the director of the State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, led a delegation of almost 200 Beijing 
appointees in Hong Kong to visit the People's Liberation Army 
(PLA) stationed in Guangdong. This could have been an excellent 
occasion for the Chinese military to polish up its image, 
tarnished by its role in the crackdown of the pro-democracy 
movement in Tiananmen Square five years ago. 
  The audience was by and large a compliant one. Combat skills 
aside, the army could have easily left an impression that they 
were highly disciplined and civilised. But Xinhua chose to veto 
all applications by the Hong Kong media to cover the trip, the 
first of its kind focusing on the training of the PLA to be 
deployed in Hong Kong after 1997. The official reason for the 
news agency's ruling was that the tour would involve some 
military secrets. That feeble excuse was even challenged by 
some of the guests. 
  A delegate to the National People's Congress, Miss Liu 
Yiuchu, for instance, pointed out that there were foreign 
passport-holders among those advisers on the invitation list. 
She argued that there was no reason why foreign citizens should 
be allowed, while the Hong Kong press had to be denied access. 
Xinhua was unable to come up with a sensible explanation. 
  Given the significance of the event, Hong Kong journalists 
opted to neglect the reporting guidelines set by the State 
Council and tried their luck anyway. To their surprise, the two 
main pro-China dailies in Hong Kong and the Guangdong Television 
Station were permitted to cover the event. The television 
footage on the company's demonstration shown on the local 
channels was, in fact, copied from the Guangdong station. 
  Despite the reporters' technically illegal status, Mr Zhang 
Junsheng, the Xinhua spokesman, chose to make public comments 
about the merits of the PLA and their need for more contact with 
the public through the eager Hong Kong press. This makes a 
complete mockery of the Chinese authorities' rules on Hong Kong 
reporters' activities on the mainland. Only a few days before, 
other Chinese functionaries, such as Mr Wang Fengchao and Sun 
Nansheng, declared that it was necessary to weed out illegal 
reporting by the Hong Kong media. 
  The way the NCNA handled the tour has further alienated the 
local news media. This incident came within a couple of weeks 
of more than 1,300 journalists signing a petition, demanding 
China respect the freedom of the press. And another 130-odd 
reporters on the China beat further pledged to boycott freebies 
offered by official Chinese units for a month. 
  The display of the PLA's military might was followed by an 
auspicious ceremony to mark the Bank of China's admission to the 
exclusive club of banknote-issuing institutions in Hong Kong. 
The issuing of $3 billion worth of BOC notes does not carry 
substantial financial implications, but the move symbolises 
Beijing's increasing presence in the territory. It serves as 
the most visible reminder of the coming of China, before the 
five-star bauhinia flag for the future Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region is raised on July 1, 1997. 
  Many note collectors were disappointed when the bank 
announced that some of the new banknotes with lucky number 
sequences were withheld for a charity auction. A press release 
by the bank described the distribution of the new notes to its 
customers on the first day as orderly. However, it has emerged 
that only an estimated 500 of the 12,000 sets for collectors 
managed to reach the bank's branch offices for public 
consumption. Many of those with lucky sequence numbers had been 
reserved reportedly for the bank's own employees and its major 
accounts. This serves a reminder to residents of the prevalence 
of nepotism within the Chinese bureaucracy. 
  Mr Lu, who heads the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, 
attended both the occasions. It does not appear to be the case 
that he is insensitive to press coverage. He was seen reading a 
pile of local dailies, in both Chinese and English, before 
starting the proceedings of the economics sub-group of the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) yesterday. It has thus 
remained unexplained why he was so determined to dodge not only 
protesters but also the press, during the first two days of his 
visit. 
  It was only on his third day in the territory that he agreed 
to make a brief statement in front of the cameras, saying that 
the Hong Kong Government's unfriendly attitude towards the PWC 
was to blame for his refusal to meet the Governor. Public 
opinion is clearly sympathetic to the Governor, as residents are 
keen to see the two top officials resume direct dialogue. 
  Mr Lu was probably speaking the truth when he noted that it 
would not be productive even if he were to meet Mr Patten at 
this stage, while official Sino-British relations are so sour. 
Yet this has reflected badly on his colleagues, who earlier 
justified his snubbing the Governor on the grounds that Mr Lu 
was too busy and that he was not wearing his hat as the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office's director. His first few lines 
in Hong Kong reinforced the widespread impression that official 
Chinese spokesmen, including those from both the Foreign 
Ministry, Xinhua and Mr Lu's own office, cannot be taken too 
seriously.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The three tiers in the 
political structure in Hong Kong formed on the electoral methods 
passed by the present Legislative Council will all be terminated 
on June 30, 1997, said a senior Chinese official here today. 
  The official said that due to the breakdown of the 
Sino-British political talks, there will be no "through train" 
for the members of the present Legislative Council in Hong Kong. 
  Nor will there be "through train compartment" or "partial 
through train" for them, he added. 
  Wang Fengchao, a member of the Political Affairs Panel of 
the 
Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee for 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), made these 
remarks here today after holding separate talks with two 
political parties in the territory. 
  The so-called "through train" mainly means that members of 
Hong Kong's last Legislative Council may become, upon 
confirmation by the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee, members 
of the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR of the 
People's Republic of China upon China's resumption of the 
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. Wang 
said that starting from July 1, 1997, the regional organizations 
and the Legislative Council in Hong Kong shall be re- organized 
in accordance with the Basic Law and the provisions of the 
National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. 
He said that the fact that there will be no "through train" in 
political aspect does not mean that there will be no smooth 
transition in Hong Kong. "Under the situation where there is 
no cooperation on the British side, we hope to cooperate with 
British side in the fields concerning the economy and people's 
livelihood in Hong Kong," said Wang. However, he said that 
whether there will be cooperation or not in these fields mainly 
depends on the attitude taken by the British side. Wang said 
that the Chinese side sincerely hopes that the losses caused by 
the uncooperation of the British side in the political field 
could be reduced to minimum with the broad participation of Hong 
Kong people so that a smooth transfer could be ensured in 1997 
and the long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong could be 
maintained.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing and agencies] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Chinese Government marked yesterday's 75th 
anniversary of the May 4 Movement by placing one of the 
country's most prominent scientists and democracy activists 
under house arrest. Professor Xu Liangying, who for many people 
personifies the ideals of science and democracy first evoked 
during the 1919 May 4 Movement, said two police officers had 
been placed at the entrance to his apartment building yesterday 
morning, preventing him from leaving. 
  In Tiananmen Square, authorities hosted official functions 
to 
stop dissidents from holding pro-democracy activities at the 
scene of the June 4, 1989, massacre. In an early morning 
ceremony on the square's windy expanse, 10,000 youths, including 
middle school pupils, police cadets and workers, pledged 
allegiance to the party's Communist Youth League. They stood in 
formation behind leaders holding large red flags, and thrust 
their right fists into the air as they vowed to struggle for 
communism. Van-loads of plainclothes and uniformed police were 
posted on and around the square all day. 
  In a telephone interview yesterday, Professor Xu said: "It 
is very important that there be free and open discussion of 
science and democracy on this anniversary, but it is obvious 
they don't want me to talk about it." After being allowed a 
certain amount of freedom over the past few weeks, Professor Xu 
said it was ironic that the authorities should choose the 75th 
anniversary of a patriotic movement to restrict his movements 
once again. "They clearly still think it is a very sensitive 
date," he said. 
  The Government used the anniversary to urge the country's 
youth to uphold "the fine tradition of the May 4 Movement" and 
shoulder the "historic mission" to bring China into the 21st 
century. The official party newspaper, the People's Daily 
[RENMIN RIBAO], said the fundamental goal of that mission was to 
stress the study of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's theories on 
developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and adherence 
to the party's basic line. 
  Professor Xu, however, found the connection between Deng 
Xiaoping's theories and the spirit of May 4 a little hard to 
swallow. "That's ridiculous," he said. "What has Deng got to 
do with May 4?" Students at Beijing University, one of the most 
active colleges during the May 4 Movement, were equally 
doubtful. "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion," an 
economics research student at the university said of the 
editorial. Reading Mr Deng's works was useful in understanding 
modern society and the economy, he said, but there was no need 
to study the patriarch's theories religiously. 
  This year's anniversary celebrations have been kept 
relatively low key by the authorities in order to prevent 
China's youth from getting too carried away with the spirit of 
the May 4 Movement. But most students at Beijing University 
were not in a particularly festive mood anyway. There was no 
way for students to enjoy anniversary activities not sanctioned 
by the school authorities even if they wanted to, another 
student said. Likewise, he said, it would be virtually 
impossible for students in Beijing to be able to mark the fifth 
anniversary of the June 4 massacre. 
  Despite being downplayed by the authorities, most students 
interviewed at Beijing University yesterday said the May 4 
Movement was still of significance for today's younger 
generation. The spirit, idealism and patriotism of May 4 was 
still evident, it was just expressed in different ways, they 
said. 
  The ideals of "science and democracy" were still held by 
many 
students although the development of the legal system was 
equally important, the economics research student said. Most 
students, however, were more concerned with developing their own 
potential. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bonn, May 2 (XINHUA) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
said today that he believed the agreement on Palestinian 
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho could be signed on 
Wednesday [4 May]. 
  'Arafat made the remarks at a press conference at the 
headquarters of Daimler-Benz A.G. in Stuttgart, Germany. 
  Commenting on the planned signing of the self-rule agreement 
in Cairo Wednesday, the PLO leader said, "where there is will 
there is a way." 
  But he cautioned that one person cannot dance a tango and 
the 
success also depends on the other party. 
  He said his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
in Cairo tomorrow will be devoted to solving "some problems" and 
he hoped the meeting could "remove obstacles." 
  Asked when he would return to Jerusalem, Jericho or Gaza, 
'Arafat said this will depend on when Israel withdraws its 
troops from the occupied territories. 
  Israeli Army should have been pulled out of Gaza and the 
Jericho area before April 13 in accordance with an original plan. 
  'Arafat arrived in Stuttgart early today on a day-long visit 
at the invitation of the German automaker Daimler-Benz A.G. He 
met with company president Edzard Reuter on cooperation between 
Palestine and Germany. He also conferred with Erwin Teufel, 
minister-president of Baden- Wurttemberg.

<F P=106> [XINHUA "News Analysis" by Xia Haitao and Liu Shun: "Chances </F>
of Palestinian Self-Rule"] 
  [Text] Cairo, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Overlooked by two 
background statues of a young girl holding a peace dove, 
Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin today put seal to the Gaza-Jericho self-rule 
agreement which aims to bring peace to the two antagonistic 
peoples. 
  The historic scene, witnessed by more than 2,000 dignitaries 
and guests at the Cairo International Conference Center, marks a 
"new dawn" to the people in Gaza and Jericho, as chief PLO 
negotiator Nabil Shaath put it. It opens a new page in the 
Palestinian annals which up till now have been soaked in blood 
and tears. 
  For the Palestinians in the occupied land, what the 
self-rule 
agreement means most is that it gives them sovereignty symbols 
-- the power of legislation, their own passports, postage stamps 
and area code, their own airline, radio and TV stations, the 
right to fish freely in their own territorial seas and above 
all, they will see their own armed policemen patrolling the 
streets instead of facing the black barrels of Israeli guns. 
  To run the self-rule regions, the PLO Executive Committee 
has 
named a 25-member National Authority Council. It will be headed 
by 'Arafat, who is expected to enter into Gaza and Jericho in 
early June, and made up of 12 people from the occupied 
territories and the diaspora respectively, assuring a political 
leadership at long last to the Palestinians in the occupied 
territories. 
  Poor and neglected as it is in the occupied land, economic 
development occupies a top priority for the Palestinian autonomy 
government, and it has its chances. 
  Of the several joint PLO-Israeli coordination committees, 
the 
economic coordination committee has reaped good results in their 
negotiations. They signed an economic pact in Paris on April 
29. The self-rule authority will establish a monetary mechanism, 
manage foreign currency reserves, conduct its own direct tax 
policy and run its own import and export business. 
  Long sufferings of the Palestinians have drawn world-wide 
sympathy. More than 40 countries have offered to supply 2 
billion U.S. dollars to aid the self-rule which also provides 
good investment opportunities for the successful Palestinian 
financers and entrepreneurs in the diaspora. 
  With a level of self-controlled economic institutions at 
home 
and assistance offers worldwide, the self-rule authority could 
do something to the occupation-shattered economy. 
  From being occupied to self-rule is a drastic turn that 
unavoidably invites post-occupation frictions and uncertainties. 
Besides the continuing joint committees on liaison, security and 
civil affairs, two dispute committees and a trilateral 
cooperation and coordination mechanism set up by the self-rule 
agreement are meant to this rescue. 
  As 'Arafat put it Monday [2 May], the Gaza-Jericho self-rule 
agreement is an initial step toward the establishment of a 
Palestinian state and Israeli withdrawal from all occupied lands 
including Jerusalem. The more difficult negotiations on the 
final status of the occupied territories lie ahead and there is 
a long way to go to achieve a complete resolution of the 
Palestinian issue. 
  This initial step, which leads to partial Israeli withdrawal 
from the occupied land, will have political and psychological 
effects on the Palestinians and Arabs. It will enable the Arab 
parties concerned, Israel and world powers to focus their 
efforts on other tracks of Arab-Israeli negotiations, 
particularly the Syrian-Israeli track. 
  In two weeks time, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher 
will begin another diplomatic shuttle in the Middle East region. 
He said he would mainly push forward the Syrian-Israeli talks. 
The impetus the agreement on the implementation of the 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho gave to the whole Middle East 
peace process is obviously felt.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on Anhui CPC Secretary Lu Rongjing's </F>
anticorruption speech to the provincial disciplinary inspection 
committee meeting on 21 March] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 21 March, Lu Rongjing, secretary 
of the Anhui provincial CPC committee, delivered an important 
speech at the plenary session of the ninth provincial 
disciplinary inspection committee. He pointed out that as the 
anticorruption struggle is a long-term and arduous task, leaders 
at various levels of party committees and governments must take 
the overall situation into consideration; correctly handle the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability; be 
fully aware that economic construction is the central task; 
persist in carrying out the policy of promoting the reform and 
opening up drive with one hand and cracking down on severe 
crimes with the other, equally stressing both; integrate well 
the anticorruption struggle with the efforts to deepen reform 
measures, to open the province wider to the outside world, to 
promote development, and to maintain stability, so that the 
anticorruption struggle will be carried out in an in-depth, 
lasting, and more effective manner. 
  At the beginning of the speech, Lu Rongjing gave a positive 
appraisal to the results which Anhui has achieved in the earlier 
stage of the anticorruption drive. He said last year was a year 
in which the province witnessed a rapid progress in reform, 
opening up, and in economic construction as well as a year in 
which the province achieved great progress in the anticorruption 
drive. Particularly since the convening of the plenary session 
of the second meeting of the Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection, various levels of discipline inspection committees 
in the province, following the unified arrangement made by the 
CPC Central Committee and the provincial CPC committee, further 
enhanced anticorruption measures; applied greater energy on 
anticorruption work with special efforts concentrating on 
leading comrades' checking on their own honest performing of 
their official duties, on investigating and handling major and 
important cases, and on rectifying unhealthy tendencies among 
various trades and professions. The drive had been 
unprecedented in terms of propaganda drive, scale, and effect. 
The province's anticorruption momentum is excellent as a whole 
and its development is healthy. The province has scored 
results, though in varying degrees, in the three anticorruption 
tasks proposed by the CPC Central Committee; blunted the 
momentum of the spread of negative and corrupt phenomena; 
reduced the number of corruption cases that has long incurred 
the wrath of the masses; and further enhanced the enthusiasm and 
increased the confidence of the broad mass of cadres and the 
masses to take part in the anticorruption struggle. 
  Lu Rongjing pointed out the need for affirming the results 
scored in the earlier stage of the anticorruption drive from a 
spirit of seeking truth from facts. However, he cautioned 
against making an overestimation of the results. He said all 
must be aware of the fact that the province has only achieved 
initial anticorruption results and that the province might have 
solved some superficial corruption issues in the earlier stage 
of the anticorruption drive. However, some hidden and 
deep-seated problems have yet to be solved or even left 
untouched. Seen from the entire province's situation, the 
anticorruption work has also been uneven. Therefore, the 
anticorruption struggle's situation is still grim and the task 
ahead is still arduous. Leading comrades at various levels of 
party committees and governments and comrades at various levels 
of discipline inspection and supervision organs must remain 
sober- headed; must never become complacent and overly 
optimistic because of the initial results in the anticorruption 
drive; must not dismiss the existing problems as insignificant; 
and must not lower our guard. 
  Lu Rongjing added: To a great extend, whether the 
anticorruption struggle can proceed smoothly and successfully 
depends on the awareness of the people, especially the awareness 
of leading cadres at all levels. Only when we have a consensus 
of view can we have the initiative, the willingness, and the 
determination to fight corruption, otherwise we will approach 
the problem negatively and passively. The vast number of party 
member cadres, especially those in leading positions, must study 
the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council on fighting corruption and promoting work ethics, as 
well as the guidelines laid down by the second and third plenary 
sessions of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and 
Comrade Jiang Zemin's talks so that we can achieve greater 
consensus of view, clear up misunderstandings, do away with 
misgivings, and act even more positively, consciously, and 
earnestly while launching the anticorruption struggle -- and not 
do so negatively, positively, or perfunctorily -- so that we can 
seize victories at every stage, promote political and social 
stability throughout Anhui, and expedite the healthy development 
of reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  On what will be done next in fighting corruption, Lu 
Rongjing 
said: In real life, many phenomena of corruption have generated 
from going against the objective of serving the people 
wholeheartedly, or from failing to take the interests of the 
masses into account. Thus, the guideline for our fight against 
corruption is quite clear, namely we must take the masses' 
interests into account and consider forging stronger ties with 
the masses as an important job in fighting corruption. Leading 
cadres at all levels must start by dealing with problems to 
which the masses have responded strongly; earnestly deal with 
problems in their respective regions, departments, and units; 
and deal with major problems themselves. We must set examples 
in fighting corruption and promoting work ethics by taking the 
lead in carrying out the Central Committee's requirements for 
fighting corruption. We must be more aware of the need to take 
the masses interests into account, be concerned with the masses 
plight, and always bear in mind the masses' problems. Only by 
doing so can we have the trust of the people, enable the masses 
to see our determination to fight corruption and solve our own 
problems, mobilize the masses' initiative, and forge closer ties 
between the party and the people. 
  Lu Rongjing stressed: Whether or not the fight against 
corruption can proceed successfully rests primarily with 
leadership. Party committees and governments at all levels must 
consider the fight against corruption as one of their most 
important tasks, one that should be placed high on their agenda. 
We must earnestly assume leadership, act personally to deal 
with major issues, and mobilize all social quarters to fight 
corruption. Each and every party member must take part in the 
endeavor, and all party and government organizations must exert 
efforts together. Organizations of one level, after dealing 
with their own problems, must make sure that the work of 
organizations of the next level is properly accomplished. In 
addition to following through with the regulations set by the 
CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission for fighting corruption and 
promoting work ethics, all regions, departments, and units must 
proceed from their actual situations and come up with their own 
priorities; and then they must take stronger measures, set more 
effective rules, and establish more effective operating 
mechanisms to make sure that the fight against corruption can 
proceed with clear objectives and that there are requirements to 
fulfill and measures to take for attaining these objectives. 
Leading bodies of party and government organizations must 
regard improvement of party conduct and work ethics as well as 
fight against corruption as responsibilities to fulfill during 
their terms of office. Responsibilities governing leading party 
members' conduct and work ethics must be established and 
improved, and rules should be set to divide the responsibilities 
to make sure that all measures are implemented and all 
objectives attained. 
  Lu Rongjing continued: Under the new situation, the fight 
against corruption faces many new situations and new problems. 
This being the case, leading cadres at all levels must intensify 
their investigation and study so as to find ways to deal with 
problems and accumulate the needed experiences for expediting 
the fight against corruption. Owing to our imperfect laws and 
nonstandardized rules for government conduct and enterprises' 
market conduct at a time when the planned economy is being 
replaced by a market economy, our enterprises now face many 
formidable problems of various descriptions. In particular, 
leaders at all levels must intensify their investigation and 
study of enterprises, attach importance to resolving their 
existing problems, and firmly and strictly punish those who have 
seriously violated laws and discipline. If the mistakes made by 
persons in charge of enterprises have nothing to do with abusing 
authority for personal gains and have not violated the law, we 
need not demand them to be perfect, but should protect them and 
encourage them to explore and proceed with their reforms bravely 
after sincerely pointing out and criticizing their mistakes as 
well as helping and educating them so that they can make new 
contributions to the development of their enterprises. 
  Lu Rongjing pointed out: Because of the protracted nature 
and formidability of the fight against corruption, we must, 
during the fight against corruption, deal with the root causes 
and the symptoms and outstanding and routine problems at the 
same time. On the one hand, we must firmly punish all corrupt 
elements who have abused their authority for personal gains, 
bent the law, and accepted and given bribes. By no means should 
we be lenient to these elements and by no means should we let 
these corrupt elements do whatever they want and remain at 
large. On the other hand, while we fight against corruption, we 
should make corrections and proceed to build or improve 
mechanisms that can effectively restrain the generation and 
spreading of the corruption phenomena. To make sure that all 
measures for fighting corruption and promoting work ethics are 
followed through, we must continue to intensify our efforts in 
supervising the performance of leading cadres in examining 
themselves, in correcting their own mistakes, and in dealing 
with cases about irregularities. We must attach importance to 
supporting the operations of specialized organs so that 
discipline inspection, procuratorial, and supervisory organs can 
give full scope to their important roles in fighting corruption. 
  Lu Rongjing concluded: Ever since the party Central 
Committee issued the order to fight corruption and promote work 
ethics, the new outlook in many areas as well as the vivid facts 
about censuring corruption have increased the masses' confidence 
and enabled them to see a hopeful future. The macroclimate for 
fighting corruption and promoting work ethics has now appeared, 
specific assignments have been set, and measures have been drawn 
up. As long as we make genuine efforts to fight corruption and 
follow through with all measures, we certainly can succeed at 
various stages in deepening the fight against corruption. 
  Attending the meeting on the afternoon of 21 March were 
leading comrades of the provincial party committee standing 
committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee, 
and the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, as well as various provincial 
departments, committees, and bureaus.

<F P=106> [From the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] A provincial conference on urban vegetable work was 
held in Hefei from 2 to 3 April. It conveyed and implemented 
the guidelines of the two national meetings on vegetable basket 
work convened by the State Council, and drew up an overall plan 
for vegetable work this year. The conference called on 
governments at all levels, especially city governments, to 
strengthen leadership, see to it that the vegetable basket 
project is well carried out, and make unremitting efforts to 
ensure ample market supply, stabilize prices, and stabilize 
society. 
  Governor Fu Xishou and Vice Governor Zhang Runxia attended 
the conference. Each made an important speech. 
  In the past six years since the implementation of the 
vegetable basket project in Anhui, the provincial government has 
appropriated 17 million yuan to support and encourage cities to 
grow vegetables under the program of replacing subsidies with 
rewards. Marked results have been achieved thanks to the great 
deal of work done by the governments at all levels. At present, 
a large number of bases for growing vegetables have been 
established throughout the province. In 1993, the province's 
per capita consumption of vegetable, meat, and eggs approached 
the level of economically developed areas in the country, but 
some existing problems should not be overlooked. From the 
middle of November last year to the beginning of this year, the 
prices of major staple food such as popular vegetables and pork 
in urban areas rose considerably, thus pushing up the general 
price index. 
  Analyzing the causes for the price rises, Vice Governor 
Zhang 
Runxia said: The rise of vegetable prices at the end of last 
year was related to natural disasters, but it also exposed the 
problems in the areas of production and commodity circulation. 
The main problems are: In the past two years, the supply of 
vegetables and other nonstaple food has been relatively good. 
As a result, there has been a relaxation of investment in and 
service in connection with the vegetable basket project. 
Furthermore, as the pace of urban construction was accelerated, 
fine and high-yield vegetable- growing plots in suburban areas 
have been used for construction purposes. In the past two years 
urban vegetable-growing plots throughout the province decreased 
by 30,000 mu. The building of new vegetable-growing plots 
failed to meet demand due to a lack of investment. As there was 
a shortage of labor for growing vegetables in urban and suburban 
areas, some vegetable plots were abandoned or badly managed. 
  Vice Governor Zhang Runxia pointed out: We should 
conscientiously sum up experiences and lessons and carry out the 
vegetable basket project successfully with a high sense of 
responsibility to the people. 
  In his speech, after briefing the participants on the 
guidelines of the recently held central conference on rural 
work, Governor Fu Xishou stressed: Carrying out the vegetable 
basket project well is an important measure for checking 
inflation. This year is vital for us to establish a socialist 
market economic structure. If we fail to stabilize the supply 
of vegetables and rice and allow prices to rise considerably, 
social stability will be affected, and our reform and 
development will be affected. Therefore, it is the bounden duty 
of governments at all levels to solve the problem of vegetable 
supply. They should continue to implement the system of placing 
the responsibility on city mayors and make the vegetable basket 
work an important criterion for evaluating city mayors. Before 
its term expires, the provincial government will continue to 
pursue the policy of replacing subsidies with rewards. It has 
been decided at an executive meeting of the provincial 
government that this year the provincial government will 
appropriate a sum of fund to commend and reward cities that have 
done exceptionally well in carrying out the vegetable basket 
project. 
  Fu Xishou pointed out: At present, we should strive to solve 
the few outstanding problems regarding the vegetable basket 
project. First, we should stabilize the area for growing 
vegetables and strictly ban indiscriminate requisitioning of 
vegetable plots for use for other purposes. Second, we should 
establish markets for agricultural and sideline products. 
Third, we should grasp the means of macroeconomic regulation 
and control; establish a reserve system for meat, vegetables, 
sugar, and other major staple food; establish a risk fund for 
nonstaple food and a system for monitoring the prices of 
agricultural and sideline products. Fourth, we should 
effectively strengthen market management and concentrate on 
resolutely punishing such illegal acts as manipulating the 
markets, jacking up prices, producing and selling faked and 
shoddy goods, and swindling the masses so as to safeguard the 
interests of producers and consumers. Fifth, all departments 
should coordinate in carrying out the vegetable basket project 
well.

<F P=106> [Report by Zheng Yu (6774 3842): "Abulaiti Abudurexiti </F>
Stresses Strengthening the Construction of Infrastructures and 
Basic Industries"] 
  [Text] "To enhance the staying power of Xinjiang's economic 
development and to promote rapid and efficient economic growth, 
it is necessary to strengthen the construction of 
infrastructures and basic industries." This is what Abulaiti 
Abudurexiti, chairman of the Xinjiang autonomous regional 
government, pointed out at a regional work meeting on 
construction on 31 March. 
  After reviewing Xinjiang's capital construction last year, 
Abulaiti Abudurexiti pointed out: This year, while undertaking 
investment restructuring measures, our region will further 
expand key constructions and increase investment in a large 
group of key construction projects such as the second Lanxin 
railway line; the Xian-Lanzhou-Urumqi optical cable; the 
Duzishan ethylene project; the Urumqi airport expansion project; 
and the Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan high-quality road. At a stage 
when we have achieved overall progress and key breakthroughs in 
reform, the construction front must also actively implement 
reform measures in capital construction management systems as 
well as bring into full play the role of market mechanisms. For 
new construction projects, we must fully implement open-bidding 
and owners' responsibility systems. It is necessary to 
establish and improve the evaluation report system for 
construction projects as well as to strengthen the management of 
project contracting. The construction industry must actively 
explore the international construction market. Not only should 
the industry open up the markets of surrounding countries and 
Central Asia but also those of the East Asia, Southeast Asia, 
and other countries and regions. It is necessary to win more 
contracts for foreign construction projects and labor 
cooperation to spur exports of building materials and mechanical 
equipment. 
  Speaking on the specific issue of urban construction, 
Abulaiti Abudurexiti stressed: Currently, the primary task is 
to strengthen urban planning management. The wider we open up 
and the more vigorously we develop the economy, the tighter 
control on urban planning management should be exercised in 
accordance with the law. On the other hand, in urban planning 
management, we should strive to streamline our work and raise 
efficiency by reducing unnecessary jobs. Economic development 
zones, cooperation zones, and various ports must effectively 
tackle infrastructure construction. We should not place hopes on 
foreign investors to develop the region for us but rather should 
create conditions to attract their investment.

  [Text] The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative

The meeting of the political ad hoc group began on 2 May, and 
that of the economic ad hoc group will follow two days later. 
  Lu Ping, vice chairman and secretary of the PWC; PWC Vice 
Chairman Zhou Nan, and the mainland members of the two ad hoc 
groups will attend the group meetings to join other businessmen 
members from Hong Kong in discussing a series of important items 
on the agenda. 
  During the meetings, PWC members will hear Hong Kong 
compatriots' opinions on Hong Kong's smooth transition and on 
successfully carrying out the work of the PWC. 
  At the 2 May meeting of the political ad hoc group, the 
participants discussed issues on organs to be set up on the 
mainland by the SAR government. Some members strongly 
criticized the report on Sino-UK relations issued by the UK 
Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, pointing out that the 
report is trying to play the international card. It negates the 
articles of the Basic Law and supports Chris Patten's program. 
This shows that Britain is determined to continue its policy of 
confrontation with China on the Hong Kong issue. 
  Meanwhile, various newspapers published in Hong Kong on 2 
May 
carried news of the holding of the PWC group meetings in Hong 
Kong, and some of the newspapers published editorials welcoming 
the PWC's meeting in Hong Kong.

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Tian Zengpei, Chinese 
vice-minister of foreign affairs, summoned U.S. Ambassador 
Stapleton Roy here today, and lodged a strong protest with the 
United States against its Foreign Relations Authorization Act. 
  Tian said that on April 28, the United States Congress 
passed 
the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 1994 and 
1995, which was signed by the U.S. President on April 30. 
  When this bill was being discussed, the Chinese side 
expressed serious concern over the anti-China provisions and 
made several solemn representations with the U.S. side, Tian 
said, adding that "We pointed out to the U.S side that these 
provisions, which had severely infringed on China's sovereignty 
and constituted a gross interference in China's internal 
affairs, would cause serious damage to Sino-U.S. relations." 
  The U.S. side, however, in disregard of the Chinese side's 
strong opposition and representations, went ahead with the 
passage and signature of this bill that contains many provisions 
detrimental to China's fundamental interests. This can not but 
arouse great indignation of the Chinese people, the 
vice-minister said. 
  "I am hereby instructed to lodge a strong protest with the 
United States Government on this issue", Tian said. 
  It is known to all that there is only one China and that 
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, he said, and the 
government of the People's Republic of China, as the sole legal 
government representing the whole of China, is recognized by the 
United Nations and the international community. 
  With regard to the Taiwan question, Tian said, the U.S. 
Government has made unambiguous commitment in the three 
Sino-U.S. Joint communiques, and is therefore bound by its 
international obligations. But the authorization act states 
that "Section 3 of Taiwan Relations Act takes primacy over 
statements of government policies, including communiques, 
regulations, directives and policies based thereon", thus openly 
trampling on the communique of August 17, 1982 between the 
Chinese and American Governments and seriously undermining the 
basis of Sino-U.S. relations. 
  The vice-minister said that the act also advocates visits by 
American cabinet-level officials to Taiwan and calls on the 
American President to take steps to express clearly U.S. support 
to Taiwan in bilateral relations and multilateral organizations 
of which the United States is a member. 
  "This is a deliberate attempt to create `two Chinas', `one 
China and one Taiwan' in the international arena that completely 
contravenes the U.S. Government's commitment to pursue a `one 
China' policy," Tian said, and this attempt by the U.S. side to 
sabotage China's peaceful reunification and create tension in 
the Taiwan Straits will certainly meet with the resolute 
position of the Chinese people including our Taiwan compatriots, 
and is doomed to failure. 
  The vice foreign minister also said that Tibet has always 
been an inseparable part of China ever since the 13th century, 
and no country in the world, including the United States, 
recognizes Tibet as an independent country. But the act openly 
refers to Tibet as a "country", alleging that Tibet is an 
"occupied sovereign country" and "its true representatives are 
the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile", and even 
asks the United States Information Agency to establish an 
"office" in Lhasa for the development of educational and 
cultural exchanges with the "people of Tibet". 
  He said that it is indeed shocking to see such a contempt 
for 
the basic norms governing the international relations, such open 
infringement of China's sovereignty and attempt to split China. 
  The Chinese people waged protracted and arduous struggles to 
safeguard their state sovereignty and territorial integrity, 
Tian said, and all attempts to split Tibet from the Chinese 
territory have ended in total failure with no exception. 
  "Anyone who still wants to follow this beaten track today 
will certainly come to grief", Tian said, and "We appeal to the 
U.S. Government to strictly adhere to its openly-stated position 
that Tibet is part of China and undertake not to get involved in 
any activities aimed at splitting China. 
  On the "Radio Free Asia", Tian said, China and many other 
Asian countries have pointed out clearly on a number of 
occasions that the true intention of the United States in 
setting up this radio is to use mass media to interfere in the 
internal affairs of China and other Asian countries. This act, 
however, approves the setting up of such a radio. 
  Tian said that this action once again shows no regard for 
the 
universally acknowledged norms governing international relations 
and violates the principles enshrined in the three-joint 
communiques between China and the United States. It is bound to 
meet the resolute opposition from the Chinese people and the 
peoples of other Asian countries. 
  Tian pointed out that Sino-U.S. relations are at a crucial 
moment right now, and "We hope that they will move in a positive 
direction." 
  However, he said, it depends on the joint efforts of both 
sides to improve and develop the bilateral relations. 
  The above-mentioned contents of the foreign relations 
authorization act seriously undermines the basis of Sino-U.S. 
relations, runs counter to the fundamental interests of both 
countries and peoples, and are inconsistent with the statement 
by the U.S. Government that it wants to develop a positive and 
constructive relationship with China. 
  The vice-minister said that China hereby states in all 
seriousness that all the anti-China sections in this act are 
absolutely objectionable and unacceptable to the Chinese 
Government and people. And "We demand that the U.S. Government 
honor its words and adopt effective measures to reverse its 
wrong position and erroneous decision so as to strictly adhere 
to the principles enshrined in the three joint communiques 
between the two countries and the basic norms governing 
international relations." 
  Otherwise, he warned, the U.S. side shall be held 
responsible 
for all the consequences arising therefrom.

  [Text] Washington, 3 May (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Clinton said on the evening of 3 May that he hoped the United 
States and China would be able to reach agreement on the human 
rights issue so that he could make a decision in early June on 
extending most-favored-nation [MFN] status to China. 
  Clinton made the above statement at a news conference in 
Atlanta, Georgia, which was televised by CNN worldwide. 
  Clinton said: Judging from current actual conditions, China 
has made significant comprehensive progress in many areas. 
However, in order to work out the differences existing between 
the United States and China before the 3 June deadline, "we 
still have a way to go." 
  He added: I believe that if we were to withdraw China's MFN 
status, U.S.-Chinese relations would be undermined. He said he 
did not wish to see this happen.

  [Text] Washington, May 4 (XINHUA) -- A group of Chinese 
students and scholars in the United States and worldwide wrote 
recently to U.S. President Bill Clinton, appealing to him to 
extend the Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status to China. 
  722 Chinese students and scholars put their signatures to 
the 
letter released here today. 
  They said in the letter that "cancelling China's MFN status 
would hurt American business interests and opportunities in 
Chinese markets as well as American general interests in Asia." 
  They expressed their strong support for the unconditional 
renewal of MFN status to China and pointed out that the MFN 
should not be linked to human rights. 
  They said they have been very pleased to realize that the 
U.S. and China have been improving their cooperation and mutual 
understanding on many issues. 
  "We have been very proud to witness that China has been 
working with the U.S. on many of these issues and providing 
significant contributions to human civilization on this earth," 
they also said. 
  They noted that "we continue to believe a view, shared by 
many outstanding Americans, that a good relationship between the 
U.S. and China will continue to serve the best national 
interests of these two great countries."

  [Text] Washington, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States-China Business Council strongly supports extending the 
Most Favored Nation trading status to China without conditions, 
its president Robert Kapp said here today. 
  Kapp said at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee's subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs that the 
U.S. business arguments for maintaining normal and expanded 
economic relations with China are clear. 
  He said that the standard arguments in favor of MFN renewal 
are familiar: 
  -- Exports to China support hundreds of thousands of U.S. 
jobs and are rapidly expanding; 
  -- U.S. firms have large and growing investments in China 
that are at risk if trade relations collapse; 
  -- Unilateral U.S. sanctions unsupported by other major 
trading nations will not succeed but will turn over economic 
opportunities to our international competitors. 
  "The U.S.-China Business Council strongly supports the 
continuation of normal trade treatment for the People's Republic 
of China, through the renewal of China's MFN status without 
conditions," Kapp noted. 
  "We will commit a policy blunder of enormous magnitude if we 
rupture the economic and commercial links that our two countries 
have worked to build over the past fifteen years," he said. 
  "We must pursue full engagement for the long term with 
China," Kapp stressed.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Why Business Disagrees With </F>
Clinton on China Trade?"] 
  [Text] Washington, May 4 (XINHUA) -- In a month, a divided 
Washington is to decide whether to extend China's most favored 
nation (MFN) trade status. Now, U.S. businesses see ironies and 
want to be heard. 
  These companies, ranging from telephone system to airplanes 
and from paper to bulldozers, argue that MFN conveys no special 
trade privileges and revoking it will impact America's 
competitiveness abroad. 
  The White House must decide by June 3 whether to extend MFN 
to China, a decision that Congress, if it desires, has a chance 
to overturn. Without MFN, goods from China will be subject to 
the prohibitive tariffs of the 1930s. 
  "We believe the first to be hurt by a reduction in 
U.S.-China 
trade would be American companies and workers," said William 
Lane, government affairs manager in the Washington office of 
Caterpillar Inc. 
  Caterpillar, which sells heavy earth moving equipment to 
China, recently announced a joint venture with Shanghai Diesel 
Engine Co. More than 1,000 of its workers are involved in 
China-related businesses. 
  As China is engaged in more infrastructure projects, Lane 
said, "these projects are the natural markets for Caterpillar's 
products. China would well be our most important market in the 
next five to 10 years." 
  The Peoria, Illinois-based manufacturer is just one of the 
many U.S. businesses which have been opposing the stand of the 
administration and congress to link China's trade with its other 
behavior like human rights. 
  In fact, China, with the fastest growing economy, is helping 
to keep U.S. production lines running. The Commerce Department, 
in a standard analysis, estimates that 160,000 to 180,000 U.S. 
jobs depend on U.S. trade with China. 
  The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) finds the 
real figure may be larger. In a report released today, NAM said 
that some 1.3 million Americans work for firms for which the 
China market is important. 
  "It is fair to say that each of these jobs would be less 
secure if trade with China were further threatened or 
eliminated," said NAM, which has just completed a survey of 
China business among its 12,000 member companies. 
  Another observation of U.S. companies, explained John 
Hayden, 
vice president of the Boeing company's Washington office, is 
that access to the Chinese market is essential to America's 
efforts to retain industrial leadership. 
  Up to three billion dollars in China's plane orders for 
Boeing would be at risk if MFN is denied, Hayden said. "In the 
near term effect, this would give non-U.S. competitors a long 
term foothold in an important market." 
  In a recent survey of 82 member firms by NAM, the effects of 
commerce with China on the U.S. and on American firms are 
expressed in varying tones and cover a number of aspects of U.S. 
businesses. 
  It contains enthusiastic comments from the Procter and 
Gamble, producer of bar soaps, shampoos and skin care and which 
entered the Chinese market in 1988. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based 
company says, "there will never be a start up as big as China." 
  The Gillette Company, a razor blades producer, gets to the 
heart of the matter best. "Gillette is a global company, and 
its operations in China make it a stronger company," the company 
says in a statement. 
  Motorola, a leading provider of wireless communications, 
semiconductors and advanced electronic systems, underscores the 
nature of a global company by identifying technology it has 
developed in China and now uses elsewhere. 
  "A stronger competitor with access to the China market will 
have a major advantage over firms without comparable access," 
the Schaumburg, Illinois-based company says. 
  U.S. companies, meanwhile, stress that MFN is really a 
misnomer since it allows a country's product to enter the U.S. 
at the same tariff rates as most other countries. 
  With almost all of the more than 130 countries in the world 
enjoying MFN treatment in trading with the U.S., "MFN, in a 
fundamental sense, is the minimum requirement of meaningful 
economic exchanges between two countries," said Jerry 
Jasinowski, NAM's president. 
  Speaking at a press conference here today, he stressed that 
unilateral imposition of restraints on trade to convey concerns 
about other policy has historically been ineffective in 
achieving changes.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley in Guangzhou] </F>
  [Text] China is planning a wide range of retaliatory 
measures against the United States should Washington fail to 
renew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status next month, 
senior Chinese officials said yesterday. Selective trade 
sanctions against state sector enterprises -- a compromise 
solution that has been mooted in Washington -- would be 
"impossible" to implement, they said. 
  The retaliatory measures would apply mainly to trade, but 
would also include foreign investment and imports as well as 
other non- economic areas such as culture, said Jiao Sunfen, 
director-general of the foreign investment department of the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation. "The 
actual measures are still a secret, but you can be sure our 
retaliation will be no lighter than the US measures against 
China," she said. 
  In the area of foreign investment, restrictions would be 
placed on the mainland investments of US enterprises which 
approved of the cancellation of MFN, she said. "When approving 
projects, we will approve other (countries) first and then take 
differing treatment for different US companies," she said. "If 
the US company opposes (the cancellation of MFN) we will give 
them some encouragement," she said. "Others will face some 
restrictions." Asked whether every US company investing in 
China would have to state publicly its attitude on the issue, 
Jiao said her department would "investigate and learn about" 
each company instead. 
  The proposed countermeasure strategy is consistent with the 
Chinese Communist Party's "united front" approach to foreign 
affairs, in which friendly forces in foreign countries are 
invited to stand with Beijing in return for certain rewards. 
Jiao said every department of the Chinese government would be 
asked for suggestions on retaliatory measures. 
  Jiao had just returned from the US as a member of the 
delegation to New York and Los Angeles led by the Foreign Trade 
Minister, Wu Yi, to drum up support for MFN extension. She said 
most of the 750 companies that attended seminars in the two 
cities opposed the linking of trade and human rights. "This 
feeling is clearer this year than last. Even the US Treasury 
Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, said the two should not be linked," 
she said. 
  China's foreign investment -- about 7 per cent of which is 
from the US -- would feel "some effects" if MFN were denied, but 
the losses would mainly be felt by US companies already in China 
which exported mainly to the US. Jiao said steps to improve 
human rights in China were "necessary", but that this was a 
matter for senior leaders to decide. "But these steps are not 
to say the human rights situation in China was bad before, or 
that because of the unreasonable US pressure we are taking 
measures to improve human rights." 
  Also speaking in Guangzhou yesterday was the president of 
Citic Trading, Xu Shiwei. Xu said China's purchases of large 
high-technology items from the US including Boeing aircraft 
would be curtailed if MFN were not renewed. "We certainly would 
take this step. It would mean the US would lose the market" 
said Xu, who was formerly commercial counsellor to the European 
Community. 
  Xu said the proposed targeting of state-owned companies 
would 
be "impossible" to implement from a political and a practical 
point of view. "Not giving MFN to state enterprises is 
tantamount to saying no to China, because state enterprises are 
the mainstay of our economy," he said.

  [Text] Washington, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Air Force 
today sent a spy satellite into a temporary orbit aboard a Titan 
4 rocket -- the most powerful unmanned vehicle of the country. 
  The liftoff from the Cape Canaveral followed a number of 
delays because of technical problems and weather conditions. 
  The U.S. military refused to disclose details about the 
satellite, but an earlier NEW YORK TIMES report said the craft 
worth 1.5 billion dollars was the most expensive of the kind. 
  Weighed five tons and equipped with a 152-meter-wide dish 
antenna, its mission was to intercept the telecommunications of 
Russian military, intelligence and political officials. 
  The spy satellite was built and would be operated by the 
National Reconnaissance Office, the United States' largest and 
most secretive intelligence service, the TIMES report said. 
  Data collected would be analyzed by the National Security 
Agency using a global network of ground stations and an array of 
supercomputers.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Arms Exports: Gain or Drain </F>
on U.S. Economy?" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Washington, May 3 (XINHUA) -- To U.S. arms dealers, 
economics is increasingly a driving force for the country's 
booming weapons trade, disrupting the world peace for which 
Washington says it cherishes a deep love. 
  To the workers at St. Louis, Fort Worth and Boston, where 
major export items like F-15, F-18 aircraft, F-16 fighters and 
Patriot missiles are made, closing plants is the least they want 
from President Clinton. 
  Controlling 57 percent of the global weapons market, the 
U.S. 
sold 35 billion U.S. dollars of weapons last year to the world's 
volatile regions, 10 times greater than Russia and more than 100 
times greater than China. 
  "The real scandal at the heart of American foreign policy is 
that the U.S., the world's leading democracy, has become the 
world's number one arms dealer," said William Hartung, author of 
"And Weapons for All". 
  U.S. officials point to the commercial interests in such 
deals: weapon sales volume in 1993 is about one third of the 
U.S. merchandise trade deficit during the period, some 150,000 
jobs will be lost if arms sales are reduced. 
  A recent study by the New York-based World Policy Institute, 
however, finds that the preoccupation with the economics of arms 
trade is one-sided. Arms exports provide "marginal, short-term" 
gains for the economy. 
  Over the past 10 years, total U.S. arms exports averaged 19 
billion dollars a year. During the same time, government loans, 
grants, cash payments and other subsidies averaged over six 
billion dollars a year. 
  This figure includes the costs of security assistance 
programs that support arms exports, U.S. Government involvement 
in air and trade shows, the 20,000 U.S. Government personnel 
involved in arms exports and the costs of writing off bad 
foreign military sales loans. 
  "This seriously undercuts the net gains to the U.S. economy 
from foreign military sales," the study says. In fiscal 1994, 
arms export-related subsidies accounted for 43 percent of the 
entire U.S. foreign aid budget. 
  Once the impacts of arms sales in stimulating arms race and 
undermining the economic growth in developing countries are 
taken into account, arms sales may even be a net drain on the 
U.S. economy, observers say. 
  The International Monetary Fund, in a study released last 
month, says that if the world arms expenditure is cut by one 
fifth, the world's consumer market will be 190 billion dollars 
larger, which is about four times the revenue of global arms 
market. 
  On defense-related employment, a Congressional Budget Office 
study in 1992 estimates that a substantial cut in U.S. arms 
sales to the Middle East will affect less than two percent of 
all defense workers and less than one in every thousand workers 
across the country. 
  This is hardly a figure to cause serious damage to the 
overall economic growth of the U.S., especially when only five 
states -- Texas, California, Florida, Michigan and Massachusetts 
-- suffer the bulk of defense conversion, observers say. 
  However, despite of the promise to curtail world arms trade, 
the Clinton administration and congress have repeatedly passed 
up the moral, political and even economic concerns that such 
trade may raise, observers say. 
  The Commerce Department has taken a hands-on role in 
promoting arms exports even as the State Department has opposed 
an industry proposal to create a new one billion dollars 
guarantee fund for weapons exports. 
  Although a few deals have been scaled back or withdrawn 
under 
the threat of congressional action, the vast majority of 50 to 
100 major arms deals made by the U.S. each year sail through 
congress with little or no scrutiny. 
  "If last year is any indication, America's arms sales 
addiction is alive and well," said William Hartung. "A change 
in policy is possible, but it's not going to happen unless the 
public and congress demand it, loudly and clearly."

  [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- In the first four months 
of this year China took delivery of 11 new passenger planes, all 
of which are in the Boeing series. 
  These new U.S.-made planes include eight Boeing-737, one 
Boeing-747, one Boeing-757 and one Boeing-767. 
  An official from the China Aviation Suppliers Corporation 
said that in the past few years, while the world's civil 
aviation industry has experienced a sluggish market, the Chinese 
aviation industry has maintained a sustained high-speed increase 
of over 30 percent. 
  With the expansion of the country's air fleet, Boeing planes 
have become the first choice for the Chinese market. In 1993 
alone 47 Boeings were delivered to the Chinese mainland, 
constituting 14 percent of the Boeing company's output for the 
year. At present China is the biggest overseas buyer of Boeings. 
  The official said that the 12 major Chinese airlines use 164 
Boeing planes, ranging from Boeing 737-500s, with more than 100 
seats to Boeing 747-400s, with 420 seats. 
  Sources said that by the end of this year the number of 
Boeing planes used by Chinese airlines will exceed 200. In 1995 
China Southern Airlines will be the first to receive a 
Boeing-777, the latest product of the Boeing company. Last year 
China Southern Airlines ordered six Boeing-777 passenger planes.

Song Jian met here today with chairman of the Pittsburgh Plate 
Glass Corporation (PPG) of the United States Jerry E. Dempsey. 
  Song said that China is carrying out its modernization 
construction, which demands a large amount of construction

  He welcomed overseas enterprises to invest in China's 
construction materials industry, hoping that PPG can cooperate 
with China in the production of glass and glass fiber. 
  PPG, a world-renowned plate glass production corporation,

a 1993 sales volume of 5.8 billion U.S. dollars. 
  During the past few years, PPG has invested a total of 
nearly 
200 million U.S. dollars in China.

  [Text] New York, May 3 (XINHUA) -- U.S. express carrier 
United Parcel Service (UPS) today announced the opening of its 
own business development offices in three gateway cities of 
China: Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. 
  The move, as the first of a series of planned expansions in 
China, is an integral part of UPS's strategy to boost its 
presence in China and the Asia-Pacific region. It follows the 
opening of UPS service to Vietnam on April 1 and the addition of 
a direct UPS flight between the U.S. and China's Taiwan Island 
in March. 
  UPS, based in Atlanta, Georgia, first entered the China 
market in 1988 through a service partner agreement with 
Sinotrans, a China-based carrier also known as China National 
Foreign Trade Transportation Corporation. Since then, UPS has 
made significant inroads and is currently one of the leading 
international express carriers in the market, serving 57 cities 
in China. 
  "With the rapid rise in economic activities in China, we see 
tremendous growth in demand for integrated express service, 
especially in the major export cities and manufacturing centers 
within the mainland," said Ed Schroeder, UPS senior vice 
president in charge of international operations. 
  Schroeder said UPS has been closely monitoring the business 
and economic developments in China and sees great potential in 
the Chinese express distribution industry. 
  "With our new offices strategically located in the key 
export 
cities of China, we can stay close to our customers and gauge 
local customer requirements and the market situation. This can 
also allow us to better tailor our services to meet the 
transportation needs in China," he said. 
  UPS is a worldwide company serving more than 185 countries 
and territories. With revenues of 17.8 billion U.S. dollars and 
a volume of 2.9 billion packages and documents in 1993, UPS is 
the largest distribution company in the world.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li </F>
Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "The Chinese Military Meddles in 
Policy Toward United States"] 
  [Text] In the 1990's, the world has entered the post-Cold 
War period. 
  However, some people in the world constantly keep the Cold 
War in mind, because they enjoyed certain advantages during the 
Cold War. 
  They are none other than the CPC authorities. 
  Whenever a popularity crisis appeared, the CPC authorities 
certainly made full use of the Cold War. They found their 
number one enemy outside the country, and then solicited the 
people's support by resorting to nationalism in order to solve 
domestic crises. 
  At present, "mountains" of contradictions and difficulties 
are accumulating in mainland China, as Hu Yaobang noted many 
years ago. A major crisis has again appeared in terms of the 
people's trust and support for the government. 
  In June last year, CHENG MING published an article which 
said 
that a hundred generals had submitted a petition to Deng 
Xiaoping. It exclusively revealed that the CPC military required 
the party leadership to revise its policy toward the United 
States. After one year of preparation, the new policy option 
was eventually adopted. This is related to the crisis of trust 
and support for the regime among the people. 
  On 1 April this year, the CPC Central Committee Secretariat 
held an extremely important meeting at the Great Hall of the 
People in Beijing, which was attended by the secretaries and 
propaganda chiefs of the party committees of all ministries, 
state commissions, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous 
regions. The meeting was chaired by Hu Jintao. Ding Guangen 
announced the work arrangements. Zhang Wannian, chief of the 
general staff of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], also 
delivered a speech at the meeting. 
  Hu Jintao first gave an assessment of the current domestic 
and international situation on behalf of the Political Bureau. 
Part of the speech was entitled "Changes in Sino-U.S. 
Relations." Hu Jintao said: 
  The whole party and the whole Army should make full 
preparations and should be more profoundly aware that Sino-U.S. 
relations will not be in a normal state in the near future, in 
the next few years, and even for a longer period to come, and 
further worsening and confrontations may occur. According to 
the global hegemonist strategy of the United States, its main 
rival at present is the PRC. Interfering in China, subverting 
the Chinese Government, and strangling China's development are 
strategic principles pursued by the United States. While facing 
hegemonism, power politics, and the aggressive anti-China 
strategy pursued by the United States, we have no room for any 
choices. We must sternly and explicitly tell the United States, 
and declare to the world also, that the normalization and 
development of relations between China and the United States can 
only be made on the basis of the two joint communiques signed by 
the two governments. The Chinese Government and the Chinese 
people have not, do not, and will not tolerate any indiscreet 
criticism or the wanton interference of hegemonism and power 
politics in China's sovereignty and internal affairs. In the 
world today, even if there is an impasse in Sino-U.S. relations, 
China will still be able to develop further and enhance its 
national strength at a rather high speed. 
  Ding Guangen gave a speech on this subject, and arranged 
propaganda work around Sino-U.S. relations. His speech included 
eight main points: 
  1. The anti-China strategy of the United States is aimed 
at strangling China's socialism and reducing China to a vassal 
state of the United States. 
  2. The United States is carrying out a series of 
activities to interfere in, harass, and attack China in the 
political, economic, and ideological fields and also in various 
international organizations. 
  3. The United States is interfering in China's internal 
affairs under the pretext of human rights, and it makes 
judgments in terms of ideology. This is a subversive strategy. 
  4. The United States supports and uses hostile forces and 
elements in China to carry out subversive and seditious 
activities, create political incidents, and thus disrupt and 
undermine our country's construction, reform, and social 
stability. 
  5. The United States itself does not participate in 
international human rights conventions of great importance and 
does not implement relevant UN resolutions. 
  6. In the last 20 to 30 years, U.S. aggression against 
other countries has caused destruction and millions of 
casualties to the victim nations. 
  7. Racial discrimination, murder, violence, and drug 
trafficking inside the United States have become serious 
disasters for its own people, and all of these expose problems 
with its system. 
  8. International opposition to hegemonism and power 
politics has grown into a force. Safeguarding national 
independence and self- determination and opposing foreign 
interference and subversion has become an irresistible trend of 
social development. 
  Chief of the General Staff Zhang Wannian made a speech 
entitled, "Reinforcing the Army, Accelerating the Army's 
Modernization, Firmly Opposing Interference and Subversion From 
Hegemonism, and Defending the Motherland" on behalf of the Armed 
Forces. 
  Zhang Wannian said: When facing blatant interference by the 
U.S. hegemonists in our internal affairs and their open support 
for the debilitating activities of hostile elements inside our 
country and hostile forces outside the mainland and overseas 
opposing and subverting our socialist system, we must reinforce 
the Armed Forces more intensively by grasping the current 
opportunity and accelerating the modernization and reform of the 
three services according to Deng Xiaoping's line on 
army-building and Chairman Jiang's instructions on the work of 
the Central Military Commission. We should strengthen and 
develop relations with all friendly countries in the world and 
oppose international hegemonism and power politics. Any 
hegemonist attempt to interfere and meddle in our state 
sovereignty and the nation's internal affairs is intolerable, 
and our national dignity can never be harmed by hegemonism and 
colonialism. We shall not challenge other nations, but we must 
keep our strength in order to defeat the challenge from 
hegemonism and colonialism. 
  According to information from the General Office of the 
CPC's 
Central Military Commission [CMC], the General Staff 
Headquarters and the Policy Research Office of the CMC have 
worked out a plan to form a global anti-hegemonist, 
anti-interference, antisubversion, and anti-aggression united 
front to unite all countries and organizations willing to oppose 
hegemonism and power politics for a certain period of time, and 
the target is the United States. Reportedly, 23 to 25 countries 
have expressed support for the proposal, and nearly 40 countries 
have consented to a similar form of organization. The opinion 
of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Political Bureau is 
that China should not be the leader of such an organization, but 
should continue to promote the development of this trend, 
because this will be conducive to its work. China will support 
the idea in principle, but will wait for an opportune moment and 
mature conditions. 
  In fact, the CPC authorities have long been preparing for an 
adjustment in relations with the United States. As of last 
March, leaders of the economic, financial, and foreign trade 
departments of various provinces, and of some large 
export-oriented enterprises, were organized to study documents 
issued by the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, and 
the documents included: "Sino-U.S. Relations Remain Tense," 
"Developments and Problems in Sino-U.S. Relations," and "China's 
Principled Position Against the U.S. Policy of Interference and 
Subversion." The purpose is for dual preparations to be made 
against a worsening of Sino-U.S. relations and for the adoption 
of countermeasures against any rupture in Sino-U.S. relations. 
  It seems natural that such an important meeting should be 
chaired by Hu Jintao, a member of the Political Bureau Standing 
Committee and a member of the Central Secretariat in charge of 
day-to-day work. However, it seems somewhat unreasonable that 
the keynote speeches were given by Ding Guangen, the Political 
Bureau member in charge of ideology, and Zhang Wannian, chief of 
the general staff of the Armed Forces. Qian Qichen, the 
Political Bureau member in charge of foreign affairs and vice 
premier of the State Council, was excluded and did not attend 
the meeting. In addition, the organs which submitted the 
proposal to set up a global anti-hegemonist united front at an 
opportune moment were not those responsible for foreign affairs, 
but the General Staff Headquarters of the PLA and the CMC Policy 
Research Office. This is rather unusual. Although it is 
necessary to oppose interference from hegemonism in internal 
affairs, why did this allow the interference of the military in 
internal administrative affairs? All such "subtleties" remain 
unclear for the time being, and a clearer picture will appear 
after the further development of events. 
  Another noticeable point is that, at present, the CPC 
authorities are adopting highhanded methods to repress 
dissidents calling for political reforms, but this is not 
supported by the masses. The CPC authorities now call 
dissidents "hostile elements" who are supported by U.S. 
hegemonists. It seems that the CPC authorities are trying to 
link pro-democracy activists advocating political reforms with 
the number-one enemy, the U.S. hegemonists, so that such 
activities can be denounced as "traitorous" and the crisis of 
domestic trust can be resolved. This shows the sinister nature 
of their intentions. 
  It should also be mentioned here that in the current 
post-Cold War period, the attempt to create and use the "Cold 
War" to mitigate and divert the people's attention from domestic 
contradictions was not invented first by the CPC authorities, 
but by North Korea. Of course, relations between the CPC 
authorities and North Korea are not good, but they may come into 
good terms again in order to join hands to launch an anti-U.S. 
campaign. 
  What should the United States do in facing this readjustment 
of the CPC's U.S. policy? It would certainly be an unwise move 
if the United States showed weakness and made concessions, and 
it may also incur losses if it takes a hard-line policy against 
the hard-line policy of the CPC, because its rival does not play 
fairly according to the rules of the game. How they adjust 
their China policy appropriately will be a great challenge and 
test for the political wisdom of U.S. statesmen.

<F P=106> [By Wang Shu (3769 2992): "Is the U.S Strategic Focus </F>
Shifting Eastward?"] 
  [Text] There are different ideas on whether or not the 
United States is changing its strategic focus (some call it the 
diplomatic strategic focus). Some say its focus is still 
Europe, while others say its focus has already switched to the 
Asia-Pacific region (or East Asia), and still others say its 
focus is in the process of switching from Europe to the 
Asia-Pacific region. I would like to express my views on this. 
  Unquestionably, after Clinton assumed office, the U.S. 
Government laid more emphasis than in the past on strengthening 
its economic and trade relations with the Asia-Pacific region. 
To put it more accurately, it will, as some Western academics 
said, strengthen its economic and trade relations with the East 
Asian region, where "economic miracles have appeared." The 
United States has always maintained close relations with Japan, 
Austria, and Canada, and regarded Japan as an important pillar 
supporting its Asia policy. In the last few years, East Asia has 
made rapid economic development, expanded its market, and 
performed what many Western academics call "East Asian miracles." 
  According to an estimate, the Asian "four small dragons'" 
GNP's increased by 5.6 percent last year and are expected to 
increase by 6.5 percent this year; ASEAN's GNP increased by 6.4 
percent last year and is expected to increase by 7.2 percent 
this year. China became the "locomotive of the East Asian 
economy" and registered a 13.4 percent growth last year. Aiming 
to "invigorate the U.S economy," the Clinton administration is 
trying to cure its economic sickness, which has disturbed the 
United States for a long time, to cope with the 
ever-intensifying world competition and preserve its leading 
position in the world. This being the case, the United States 
of course wants to seize the so-called "newly emerging 
opportunity" to explore East Asia -- "a market full of vitality" 
-- and to compete against other developed nations for a 
favorable position in this market. 
  But in developing economic cooperation with the East Asian 
region and taking this region as a diplomatic focal point, the 
United States does not mean to switch its strategic focus from 
Europe to Asia. Similarly, the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico have signed the North American Free Trade Agreement and 
are trying to expand this plan to all of Latin America. This 
only indicates the U.S. effort to strengthen economic 
cooperation with American nations and does not mean that the 
United States wishes to switch its strategic focus from Europe 
to the American nations. Europe has always served as the corner 
stone for U.S. strategy. Despite the disintegration of the 
bi-polar pattern and the Soviet Union, Europe still remains 
unsettled. As many Western academics point out, Europe is the 
region with the most developed economic, scientific, and 
technological foundation in the world; the United States has 
major economic, political, and strategic security interests in 
Europe; and Europe is an important investment region for the 
United States; so to maintain its leading position in the world, 
the United States, as always, will need the support and 
cooperation of developed European nations. The end of the Cold 
War and East-West confrontation has not changed the fact that 
major U.S. interests are in Europe or that Europe is 
strategically important to the United States. Moreover, the 
change in the international situation has caused many new 
problems and contradictions to become more complicated. The 
United States and Russia are on guard against each other and 
suspicious about each other. Examples are a recent exposure of 
Russian spies in the United States and expulsions of one other's 
diplomats. A Russian leader said that Russia is a big country, 
not a small companion. The turbulent political situation in 
Russia, the deterioration of its economic difficulties, the 
fluctuations of its reform measures, and, particularly, the 
growth of extreme nationalists and rightist forces, have all 
made the United States uneasy. There are many economic, 
political, and social difficulties in republics of the former 
Soviet Union and conflicts are serious between these republics, 
as well as between these republics and Russia. Some of them 
have resorted to the use of arms. East European nations are 
facing great internal and external difficulties and unstable 
situations, fear the reemergence of Russian chauvinism, and are 
not sure how important the role of their "peaceful partnership" 
with NATO will be. 
  In addition, since the disappearance of the Soviet Union -- 
this common enemy -- the coherent force of Western nations, 
particularly that of NATO, has become tremendously lax, 
nationalist feelings and the wish for independence are 
escalating, and differences and conflicts between various NATO 
countries -- as well as between NATO and the United States -- 
are increasing along with frictions and contradictions in their 
economic and trade relations. And following the rapid 
development of information technology, Western developed 
countries are facing intense global competition in this field. 
  Following the disintegration of the bi-polar pattern and 
the emergence of a multipolar world, the previously suppressed 
and concealed nationalist and religious feelings have strongly 
risen, broken out, or aggravated ethnic conflicts and clashes, 
seriously affecting the stability of regional situations and 
social progress. The ethnic armed clashes in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the so-called "powder keg" of the Balkan peninsula, which is 
populated with many different nationalities, are particularly 
intense and cruel. Refugees are flooding developed European 
regions and are expanding to larger regions. In addition, there 
are many ethnic problems in Europe and other countries, and 
because of economic difficulties and serious unemployment, 
nationalism is rising and rightists' and new fascists' 
activities are increasing. This has found expression in 
Russian, German, and Italian elections. The deterioration of 
ethnic and religious disputes and armed conflicts in Europe's 
surrounding regions, such as the Middle East, North Africa, and 
west Asia, has also caused concern. Western newspapers pointed 
out that most of the explosive points and tense regions in the 
world are in Europe and its surrounding countries. 
  Viewing all these, we can say that the situation in Europe 
is 
not stable. In the present-day world, it is not easy for the 
United States to maintain a balance and stability between all 
forces in Europe or to preserve its leading position and 
strategic interests there. Such being the case, it is quite 
hard to presume that in the predictable future the United States 
will switch its strategic focus (including its diplomatic 
strategic focus) from the turbulent Europe to the comparatively 
stable Asia-Pacific region or East Asia. Of course, the view 
that the U.S. strategic focus is still in Europe does not hamper 
us from assuming that it values and is strengthening economic 
cooperation with Asia-Pacific or East Asian nations; developing 
economic cooperation with them will be favorable to 
strengthening its strategic position in Europe. Even during the 
previous period of U.S.-Soviet tense confrontation and 
contention the United States never overlooked the changes in 
other regions' situations. For the United States, Europe's 
strategic position is more important than Asia's. Although East 
Asia is making fast economic development, it is still far behind 
developed European regions in terms of economic and 
technological foundation, nor can its capital and personnel be 
compared with these regions'. For a long time to come, East 
Asia will not be able to surpass Europe. At present, the United 
States is strengthening its relations with the Asia-Pacific 
region, but it is impossible and unnecessary for the United 
States to switch its strategic focus from Europe to the Asia- 
Pacific region now. As President Clinton said not long ago, 
"Europe is still where U.S. interests lie" and the U.S. 
"security nucleus is still in Europe."

  [Text] Canadian officials have steered clear of clashing 
with Beijing over democratic development in Hong Kong. 
  The highest-level delegation from Ottawa since the 1989 
Tiananmen massacre avoided details of the Governor's political 
plans during talks in China, according to senior Canadian 
officials. 
  The subject of Hong Kong was brought up three times by the 
Canadian Governor-General, Ramon Hnatyshyn, but he went no 
further than expressing to Lu Ping, the top Chinese official in 
charge of affairs, the hope that the 1984 Sino-British Joint 
Declaration on the territory's future "would be respected". 
  In talks with the Governor, Chris Patten, in Hong Kong the 
Governor-General talked of the need for both the "letter and the 
spirit" of the Joint Declaration to be adhered to and said he 
hoped for negotiations between London and Beijing. 
  "We all very much hope for the resumption of dialogue and 
co-operation between China and Britain to give Hong Kong the 
future it deserves," one senior Canadian official said. 
  The message contrasts with that given to the Legislative 
Council last Friday when Hnatyshyn emphasised the need for 
"fairly contested and free elections" to buttress the rule of 
law. 
  But Ottawa officials denied that Canada was saying one thing 
to Hong Kong and giving a different message to Beijing. 
  While the Canadian delegation "did not specifically make the 
same comments to China" the message was the same, one official 
said. 
  The visit -- which concludes in Guangzhou today -- aimed to 
raise the profile of Canada, and discuss and develop economic 
and agricultural links. 
  Beijing was told of Canada's "concern" about human rights 
but 
was assured the issue would be kept separate from trade, the 
official said.

  [Text] Ottawa, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Bank of Montreal plans 
for an expansion in China to serve Canadian business there, the 
Canadian newspaper GLOBE AND MAIL said today. 
  Neil Tait, the bank's senior vice-president for Asian 
banking, was quoted as saying that the bank wants to upgrade its 
presence in China. It intends to convert the Guangzhou office 
into a full branch and to open a branch in Shanghai, he said. 
  "We would like to see more so that we can service the needs 
of Canadian businesses," Tait said, adding that "we believe that 
the Canadian banks have to be there on the ground in the market 
to allow Canadian business to enter China." 
  The bank's chairman and chief executive officer Matthew 
Barrett will meet Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji in Beijing 
this week to discuss the expansion plans. 
  Bank of Montreal is not the first Canadian financial 
institution to branch out in China. Last year, Royal Bank of 
Canada became the first Canadian Bank to open a full branch in 
the country. 
  Tait said it is mostly small and medium-sized businesses in 
Canada that have an interest in establishing a presence in 
China. "So the banking system has to be there as a leader as 
opposed to countries such as Europe or North America, where 
businesses are larger and can enter those markets more readily," 
he added. 
  He said, the branches will initially be offering trade 
financing services to stimulate trade between Canada and China. 
Money markets and project financing will also be offered, he 
said. 
  China has hinted at a greater role for foreign banks in its 
booming markets. Hong Kong Bank, with its affiliate Hang Seng 
Bank Ltd., has one of the largest networks among foreign banks 
in China, with 12 branches and four representative offices, 
while Standard Chartered Bank has 13 branches and offices. 
  U.S. and Japanese banks are also angling for a bigger 
presence in China.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin this afternoon expressed appreciation of 
President Clinton's willingness to improve and develop Sino-U.S. 
relations. 
  At a news conference, a reporter asked Wu Jianmin: "Do you 
have any comments on President Clinton's remarks on Sino-U.S. 
relations in response to a correspondent's question at his 3 May 
news conference on CNN?" 
  Wu Jianmin said: "China and the United States are two 
influential world powers, and the development of stable and 
healthy relations between them conforms with the fundamental 
interests of the two countries and their peoples; and also 
serves to promote peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region 
and in the world at large. There exists broad common interests 
between China and the United States, and there are also some 
differences betweEn them on certain issues. What is crucial is 
that the two countries should develop their common points and 
handle their differences properly, in strict accordance with the 
principles laid down in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques 
and on the basis of mutual respect, non-interference in each 
other's internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit." 
  He emphatically pointed out: "We appreciate President 
Clinton's expression of willingness to improve and develop 
Sino-U.S. relations. The Chinese side has already made 
tremendous efforts to improve and develop relations between the 
two countries, and it is willing, together with the U.S. side, 
to make continuous efforts to this end."

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (AFP)--China denounced Thursday U.S. 
plans to set up an information office in Tibet to promote 
discussion of human rights, caling them a blatant attempt to 
undermine Chinese sovereignty. "It is shocking for the US 
government to show contempt for the norms governing 
international relations and blatantly undermine the sovereignty 
of China and try to split China," foreign ministry spokesman Wu 
Jianmin told a weekly press briefing. 
  Provisions contained in the Foreign Relations Authorisation 
Act adopted by the U.S. Congress on April 28 instruct the 
director of the US Informations Agency "to seek to establish an 
office" in the Tibetan capital Lhasa. 
  The office would promote the discussion of human rights, 
promote U.S. private sector involvement in educational and 
cultural activities, advise Washington on Tibetan popular 
opinion and disseminate information on the United States. 
  "What the US government is going to do in this connection 
must have prior consent on the part of the Chinese Government," 
Wu said, adding: "We will definitely not agree." 
  Wu slammed the act for "even going so far as to name Tibet 
as 
a country" and demanded that Washington strictly abide by the 
principle that Tibet is an integral part of China. 
  While President Bill Clinton has agreed in principle with 
the 
sentiments contained in the relevant provisions, he has 
expressed reservations that their formulation may infringe on 
the president's prerogative in negotiations with foreign 
governments. 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific 
Affairs said Wednesday that Washington was keen to see more 
progress from Beijing on the question of Tibet, most notably on 
U.S. calls for a meeting between Tibet's exiled leader, the 
Dalai Lama, and Chinese officials.

  [Text] London, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. and Russia today 
called for a foreign ministerial meeting of the newly-formed 
contact group as soon as possible to give "a new powerful 
political impetus" to Bosnian peace negotiations. 
  The meeting of the U.S., Russian, French, British and German 
foreign ministers is expected to take place in Geneva on May 13, 
U.S. State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said in a statement 
after U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher met Russian 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in Cairo where they attended the 
signing ceremony of Israel-PLO peace agreement on Palestinian 
self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Christopher and Kozyrev "expressed serious concern over the 
continuing instability of the situation in Bosnia which could 
spark another dangerous point of conflict," McCurry said aboard 
Christopher's aircraft from Cairo to Washington, which stopped 
in Ireland to refuel. 
  The two ministers urged Bosnian Muslims and Serbs to cease 
hostilities and rEsume negotiations without preconditions on an 
overall peaceful settlement. 
  They also called for immediate steps to prevent offensive 
military action in the Serb-held Brcko area of northern Bosnia. 
  Christopher, aboard his aircraft, said he supported 
deployment of UN troops to Brcko to head off an impend)ng major 
battle between Muslim and Serb armies for a vital Serb supply 
corridor on which the town lies. 
  The contact group was established last month to put together 
diplomatic efforts of the U.S., Russia, the European Union and 
the United Nations to end the two-year-old Bosnian conflict.

  [Text] Geneva, May 5 (XINHUA) -- China joined the Nice 
agreement of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) 
on Thursday [5 May] to internationalize its trademark system. 
  The agreement, known as "The Agreement on the International 
Classification of Goods and Services for Trademark 
Registration," was first established in 1957 and is the major 
instrument of WIPO. 
  Tang Yufeng, deputy representative of the Chinese mission to 
the UN in Geneva, presented a protocol for entry to Arpad 
Bogsch, director-general of WIPO. 
  Since joining WIPO in 1980, China has signed nearly all 
international agreements protecting intellectual property rights. 
  Bogsch said that a special meeting will be held for the 
entry 
of Chinese products into international trademark registration. 
  The Nice agreement now has 36 signatory members.

established cooperative relations with more than 100 
friendship-with-China organizations all over the world since it 
was set up forty years ago. 
  He noted that CPAFFC, which is also in charge of 
coordinating 
the friendly bonding of Chinese cities with counterparts in 
other countries, has so far helped 531 pairs of friendship 
cities establish such a relationship. 
  "We have become more and more involved in economic work and

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- A reception marking the 
40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's 
Association for Friendship With Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) was 
held at the Great Hall of the People here this evening. 
  More than 800 people from all walks of life in the Chinese 
capital and all parts of the country as well as foreign friends 
attended the reception. 
  Chinese Communist Party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li 
Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan and Qian Qichen each wrote a few 
words of congratulations on the occasion. 
  Delivering a speech at the reception, Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen praised the CPAFFC for its 
important role in increasing Sino-foreign friendly contacts and 
cultural exchanges on a people-to-people basis over the past 40 
years. 
  "In the past four decades," he said, "the CPAFFC has won 
many 
sincere friends from various countries for our people and 
contributed its share to our national development and progress." 
  He continued that since the introduction of the reform and 
opening policy, China has enjoyed rapid economic growth, 
political stability, unity among the nationalities and social 
prosperity which "form the basis for our successes in foreign 
affairs." 
  In recent years, Qian noted, China's prestige and influence 
have steadily grown and countries around the world have attached 
importance to improving and developing relations with China. 
"This has provided a favorable international environment for us 
to build socialism with Chinese characteristics," he added. 
  Touching on the ongoing CPAFFC National Council meeting 
which 
convened here today, Qian pointed out that the CPAFFC has made a 
very good summing-up of its work done in the past four years. 
"Particularly, it has reaffirmed its experiences in enlarging 
the field of friendship work to cope with the changing 
international situation and in serving domestic economic 
construction," he added. 
  He said, "It is my sincere hope that the CPAFFC will 
maintain 
and carry forward its fine traditions fostered in the past 40 
years and achieve even greater results in making many friends, 
in expanding the field of and channels for non-governmental 
friendly contacts with other countries and in further exploring 
new ideas, methods and ways for the building of people's 
friendship in the new period." 
  President Han Xu of CPAFFC also spoke at the reception. 
  Among those present were Lei Jieqiong and Wang Guangying, 
vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee of China's National 
People's Congress (NPC), Huang Hua, former vice-chairman of the 
NPC Standing Committee, Gu Mu, former vice-chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the 
Foreign Affairs Office of the State Council. 
  Also present were leading members of the friendship 
associations of the U.S.-China, Bangladesh-China, 
Singapore-China, and Brazil-China, the Cote d'Ivoire-China 
Friendship Group, and Japanese friends as well as several 
diplomatic envoys stationed here.

<F P=106> [Article by Qiu Liangfa (6726 5328 4099): "General </F>
Description of Campaign Against Illegal Migration in Some 
Localities Along Fujian Coast"] 
  [Excerpts] Fuzhou West Lake Guest House, which is known 
for its scenic beauty, welcomed a number of visitors on 26 
January 1994. The 17-member U.S. State Department delegation, 
headed by Assistant Secretary Robert Gilbert, visited Fujian, 
accompanied by Dai Changshi, deputy director of the PRC Foreign 
Ministry's Consular Affairs Department. The U.S. delegation's 
China visit aimed chiefly at negotiating with the Chinese side a 
crackdown on illegal migration and migrant trafficking. The 
purpose of their trip to Fujian was to learn about the 
conditions of the campaign against illegal migration and migrant 
trafficking in the province. 
  Fujian Vice Governor Wang Jianshuan met with the U.S. 
delegation, while Ren Ziyu, director of the provincial 
government's office of foreign affairs, and Lin Minggui, 
director of the border bureau of the provincial public security 
office, participated in the talks with the U.S. delegation. A 
responsible person of the Fujian Provincial Government set out 
the Chinese Government's persistent position on the campaign 
against illegal migration and migrant trafficking, and briefed 
the delegation on the series of effective tasks and results in 
the campaign, while expressing hope for the augmenting of 
international cooperation, a crackdown on "snake heads" 
[organizers of illegal migration], and checking illegal 
migration. During the talks, members of the U.S. delegation 
expressed admiration for Fujian's work in the campaign against 
illegal migration and migrant trafficking, while saying that 
they would halt and fight against illegal migration and migrant 
trafficking through joint efforts. 
  Thus a conclusion was reached for this stage of the work on 
the issue of seething illegal emigration and migrant trafficking 
in some localities along the Fujian coast. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Marked Results in the Campaign Against Illegal Migration and </H5>
Migrant Trafficking 
  The Chinese Government has long given explicit instructions 
on the campaign against illegal migration and migrant 
trafficking. Governments at various levels in Fujian have 
attached great importance to this work, with various measures 
adopted in recent years. On several occasions, they have taken 
unified action to crack down on illegal migration and migrant 
trafficking. In June 1993, the Fujian provincial leadership 
went deep into the coastal countries to conduct investigation 
and study, and decided to unfold a special struggle to 
"investigate gangs, crack down on snake heads, uproot dens, and 
pursue criminals at large" along the Fujian coast. First, it was 
imperative to eliminate "snake heads" inside the territory and 
to mete out stern penalties; by no means should one rear a tiger 
to court calamity. Second, "snake heads" outside the border 
should be rounded up through the Interpol. Third, it was 
necessary to augment legislative work on the campaign against 
illegal migration and migrant trafficking, and to establish, 
complete and perfect various local decrees, and strengthen the 
practice of doing business according to the law. Fourth, it was 
imperative to reinforce the ability of public security and 
border personnel to fight illegal migration and migrant 
trafficking, encourage and reward relevant people who report 
illegal migration and migrant trafficking activities. Fifth, it 
was necessary to strengthen propaganda and education, publicize 
the danger of such law-breaking activities as illegal migration, 
and to educate the masses to fight illegal migration. These 
measures have scored sound results. Fuzhou -- which had a 
greater number of people engaged in illegal migration and 
migrant trafficking -- regarded the campaign against illegal 
migration and migrant trafficking as an important government 
task; set up a leading group and office dedicated to the 
campaign against illegal emigration; and transferred some 200 
cadres from city, county and prefectural organizations to 
organize some 50 work teams stationed in key villages to unfold 
this work, so as to further establish, complete, and perfect 
control and precaution measures and to implement all regulations 
in the campaign against illegal migration and migrant 
trafficking in a down-to-earth way. In 1993, Fujian uncovered 
138 cases of illegal migration and migrant trafficking, 
involving 1,499 persons; 12 batches of illegal migrants, 
totaling 2,355 in number were received and repatriated from 
Japan, Singapore, Mexico, the Marshall Islands, Honduras, 
Indonesia, Guatemala, and other regions; 303 illegal migration 
and trafficking organizers (namely "snake heads") were rounded 
up, of whom, 86 "snake heads" were given sentences, 39 were to 
undergo re-education through labor, and 109 were held in custody 
for interrogation. 
<H5>  The International Community Should Augment Cooperation </H5>
  Migrant trafficking is a kind of international illegal 
migration activity. Since reform and opening up, Fujian has 
entered a period of the most rapid economic growth in history. 
Owing to the effects of some international and domestic 
factors, however, an undercurrent of illegal migration and 
migrant trafficking surfaced along some coastal areas. It began 
in early 1989. At first, only some people along the coast 
secretly hired vessels heading for Taiwan. Then some people 
pretending to be Vietnamese refugees were trafficked to South 
Korea and Japan. Later, the practice gradually spread to 
Southeast Asia. Since 1990, illegal migration and migrant 
trafficking have targeted the United States. The chief 
characteristics of illegal migration activities were: First, 
illegal migration and migrant trafficking mainly took place in 
some localities along the Fujian coast, and in Fuzhou, focusing 
on the suburbs of Tingjiang and Langqi, as well as some coastal 
towns and townships, such as Tantou, Jingfeng, and Wu Hang, in 
Changle County and Guangtou, in Lianjiang County. Second, 
"snake heads" inside and outside the border tempted and colluded 
with each other to organize illegal migration and migrant 
trafficking. Third, the primary method of illegal migration was 
to board a vessel that sailed out to sea to rendezvous with a 
Taiwan or foreign vessel, then being trafficked to other 
countries and regions. Fourth, illegal migration methods have 
become increasingly surreptitious. Fifth, charges are reduced 
and ways of charging are changed so as to increase temptation, 
leading some of the masses to participate in illegal migration 
with the notion of trying their luck. 
  Take Fuzhou, for instance. The cases of illegal migration 
and migrant trafficking which the city has uncovered in recent 
years were organized primarily by international illegal 
migration and migrant trafficking groups and by triad 
organizations, and were manipulated by "snake heads." The 
behavior of these international illegal migration and migrant 
trafficking groups was operational, professional, secretive, and 
did international harm. The bases for organizing illegal 
migration and migrant trafficking were mostly outside the 
border, and such activities have become increasingly 
internationalized. Since 1993, the activities of a number of 
"snake heads" outside the border have been controlled by the 
Fuzhou public security and border departments, these snake 
heads included people from such countries and regions as the 
United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Most of the vessels 
intercepted while engaged in illegal migration and migrant 
trafficking were old freighters in camouflage. At the same time, 
the illegal migrants had been trained to supply seeking 
"political asylum" as the unified answer when they were likely 
to be apprehended by U.S. immigration service. All this showed 
that the solution to illegal migration and migrant trafficking 
would involve many issues, including foreign affairs, 
international cooperation, and judicial assistance. It is 
imperative for the international community to augment 
cooperation, clarify its responsibility, and crack down on 
illegal migration and migrant trafficking organizations from all 
directions. Only then will it be possible to solve the problem 
once and for all. [passage omitted]

"China, Russia Exchange Military Data on Areas Within 100 
Kilometers of the Border; China Stations Six Times More Troops 
Than Russia on Its Northern Border"] 
  [Text] New York, 4 May (LIEN HO PAO) -- On 3 May, military 
commentator Pinhov [1627 0668 1133] said (Andrey Rozykov) [5012 
5417 4430 1133], head of the Border Disarmament Negotiations 
Office, which is part of the Department of Chinese Affairs under 
the Russian Foreign Ministry, had revealed to him that Russia 
and China already had exchanged primitive military data on the 
areas within 100 km of their border, and will carry out 
disarmament work as the next stage, based on this information. 
  At the same time, Major General Anatoliy Varliya [3907 6849 
7161], a former deputy chief of the Bureau of Treaty and Law 
under the Russian Defense Ministry, revealed to Pinhov that in 
the rear areas along the border, the mainland's military 
strength is six times greater than Russia's military strength in 
the Far East, and the mainland also has three times more the 
fighter planes there, but there is no sign of major movement so 
far. 
  Pinhov said to this newspaper that Rozykov confirmed for the 
first time that within 100 km of the 4,000-km border in the 
east, the Russian side has deployed 150,000 troops, which 
include border defense forces that are not regular Russian 
military units, and that the mainland has only 50,000 armed 
personnel, made up primarily of the Armed Police, local militia, 
and some regular military units. However, in the rear areas, to 
a depth of about 300-400 km, the mainland side has concentrated 
a large number of troops. 
  Rozykov said that since 1990, the mainland has kept refusing 
the disarmament plans for cutting "military groups at the 
military region level," as proposed first by the Soviet Union 
and then by Russia, as well as the suggested "disarmament within 
25 km of the border." Even now, there are still technical 
difficulties during the disarmament negotiations, such as the 
way to distinguish regular units from other kinds of armed 
forces. He personally thought that as a compromise plan, both 
sides might cut 20-30 percent of the armed personnel currently 
deployed within 100 km of the border. 
  Varliya pointed out that the disarmament within 100 km of 
the 
border will not include the Russian garrisons in Khabarovsk and 
Vladivostok. According to him, what is important is that both 
sides have built up mutual trust, and do not view each other as 
enemies, while the direct links between the military regions of 
the two countries also have been strengthened as a result, 
whereas the first batch of Chinese military observers entered 
Russia last year.

  [Text] Moscow, May 4 (XINHUA) -- The chairman of the 
Interparliamentary Conference of the CIS, Vladimir Shumeyko, 
today suggested that Russia send peacekeeping forces to war-torn 
Nagorno-Karabakh to stop the fighting between Armenians and 
Azerbaijanis. 
  Shumeyko, who is also chairman of Russia's upper house of 
parliament, made his statement on television after a mediation 
meeting for Nagorno-Karabakh held in Kyrgyzstan. 
  Russia has already sent a peacekeeping force to Georgia, 
where Georgian government forces and Abkhazian separatists have 
been fighting. 
  Parliamentary leaders from Armenia, Azerbaijan, the 
self-styled Nagorno-Karabakh republic, and Kyrgyzstan, attended 
today's mediation meeting, sponsored by the Interparliamentary 
Conference of the CIS.

  [Text] Moscow, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Azerbaijan today rejected 
a peace plan on Nagorno-Karabakh made by the Interparliamentary 
Conference of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
  Russian media reports quoted Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of 
the CIS interparliamentary conference, as saying that Azerbaijan 
does not recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as one side of the conflict 
in that region. 
  He said that if Nagorno-Karabakh is not involved in signing 
a 
peace plan, no ceasefire will be guaranteed. 
  Parliament leaders of some CIS countries held a mediation 
meeting on Nagorno-Karabakh this week in the Central Asia 
republic of Kyrgyzstan. 
  Another side of the conflict, Armenia, has accepted the 
peace 
plan, which calls for the deployment of a CIS peacekeeping force 
in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the application by all sides of a 
ceasefire beginning on May 9. 
  Azerbaijan has also rejected a Russian plan to send a CIS 
peacekeeping force to the conflict region, and instead wants an 
international peacekeeping force. 
  Shumeyko, who is also chairman of the Russian upper house of 
parliament, said inviting an international peacekeeping force is 
not logically sound since Nagorno-Karabakh is situated within 
the CIS. Therefore, it is the CIS that should send peacekeepers, 
he said. 
  Azerbaijan regards Nagorno-Karabakh as a part of its 
sovereignty and insists that the region has been occupied by 
Armenia. 
  Nagorno-Karabakh used to be an autonomous region within 
Azerbaijan, and is largely populated by Armenians. 
  A separation movement began in 1988 and led to the 
declaration of an independent republic in the region in 
September 1991. 
  During four years of conflict in the region, an estimated 
3,000 Armenians and 4,700 Azerbaijanis were killed.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Fury Spreads Over Japanese Minister"] </F>
  [Text] China is demanding the Japanese Government treat 
with "all seriousness" the remarks made by Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano about the Japanese atrocities during their 
invasion of Nanjing. 
  The Foreign Ministry contacted the Japanese yesterday to 
express their concern over the remarks and open talks over the 
issue, spokesman Wu Jianmin said. 
  Wu said the Chinese were shocked and incensed by Nagano's 
distorted historical view of Japanese aggression. 
  Nagano told Tokyo reporters that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, 
which killed 300,000 civilians in the city that was then the 
Chinese capital, was a "fabrication." 
  Wu described the massacre as one of the most notorious 
atrocities committed by the Japanese military during their 
invasion from 1937 to 1945. 
  The international community has already reached consensus on 
the nature of the war and the massacre itself. 
  Nagano was trying to whitewash the militarism, Wu noted. 
  He said China has noted Japanese Prime Minister Hata's 
attitude toward this episode of history when he spoke in Paris 
yesterday. 
  Hata reiterated Japan's view on the history and said 
Nagano's 
remarks were "inappropriate." 
  Wu said it is in the Japanese people's interests and for 
peace and stability in Asia for Japan to adopt a correct 
attitude about its history of aggression. China always stands 
for a forward-looking approach to history and hopes Japan draw 
lessons from history, the spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, President Jiang Zemin said in Shanghai yesterday 
that Chinese and Japanese should live in friendship from 
generation to generation. 
  "Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide for the 
future," Jiang told Bunhei Hara, President of the House of 
Councillors of the Japanese Diet, the parliament. 
  He called the Japanese invasion the "unfortunate historical 
period" between the two countries.

  [Text] Seoul, May 6 (XINHUA) -- South Korea today urged 
Japan to clarify its justice minister's remarks related to World 
War II and take "appropriate" action. 
  It was nothing short of "throwing cold water on efforts by 
both countries to improve South Korea-Japanese relations for an 
incumbent cabinet minister to make such remarks," South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu told Japanese Ambassador Goto 
Toshio in a meeting here. 
  In an interview with the Japanese national newspaper 
MAINICHI 
Tuesday [2 May], Shigeto Nagano, Japan's newly-appointed justice 
minister, claimed that his country wanted to liberate Asian 
colonies from European imperialism during World War II. 
  He also dismissed the "rape of Nanjing," in which Japanese 
soldiers killed some 300,000 Chinese civilians in 1937, as "a 
hoax." 
  Nagano's remarks immediately raised anger in South Korea, a 
victim of three decades of Japanese colonial rule before its 
liberation at the end of World War II. 
  Han said Nagano's remarks have greatly shocked the South 
Korean Government and people. He added, "Such distorted 
historical perspective is very regrettable." 
  Demanding action on the incident, the South Korean foreign 
minister said that Tokyo should take "appropriate measures" for 
Nagano's remarks. 
  However, former Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
who 
left office last week, called World War II "a war of aggression" 
and said it was wrong. 
  On Wednesday, new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
described as "inappropriate" the remarks made by his justice 
minister about the killing of an estimated 300,000 Chinese 
civilians by Japanese troops. 
  "My view on the past history is that our past actions, 
including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable 
suffering and sorrow for many people," Hata said in a brief 
statement shortly after arriving in France for a two-day 
official visit.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano, who described days ago the 1937 Nanjing massacre as a 
"hoax," withdrew his remarks today in the face of mounting 
criticism both at home and abroad. 
  "My remarks on the historical incident (of the Nanjing 
massacre) which I made the other day were inappropriate, so I 
would like to retract them," he told a press conference in the 
Justice Ministry. 
  The newly appointed minister told the "MAINICHI SHIMBUN" in 
an interview Tuesday that he believed the Nanjing massacre "is a 
fabrication" and it was wrong to say "Japan's invasion of 
neighboring nations before and during the (Second World) War was 
an act of aggression." 
  The now-defunct Imperial Japanese Army troops killed more 
than 300,000 Chinese civilians in Nanjing City of Jiangsu 
Province in east China in December 1937, historians say. 
  Nagano's comment denying the historical facts sparked sharp 
criticism from other Asian countries, which suffered bitterly 
under Japan's military heels. 
  "Yesterday, Prime Minister (Tsutomu) Hata said in Paris 
regarding our country's history that our country's aggression 
and colonial rule (of its Asian neighbors) inflicted unbearable 
suffering and sorrow on many people," the minister said. 
  He acknowledged that the massacre is an "undeniable fact." 
  Nagano, who is a member of Hata's Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party), also said he "feels fully responsible" for the war 
remarks and was willing to accept Hata's decision over his 
future. 
  Hata, now on a four-nation European tour, criticized 
Nagano's 
remarks Wednesday as "inappropriate" and admitted Japan's 
wartime atrocities, saying the Japanese should not repeat such 
mistakes. 
  Earlier today, Japan's second largest opposition party, the 
Social Democratic Party, urged Hata to fire the justice minister 
for what he has said. 
  Nagano, 71,graduated in 1941 from a former elite Japanese 
military academy and took part in the 1937-1945 war of 
aggression against China as an Army officer. 
  He joined the Ground Self-Defense Force after the end of the 
war and moved up to the top rank of chief of staff before he 
retired from the military in 1980.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 3 (XINHUA) -- India is to send its 
first electronics delegation to China. 
  Organised under the aegis of the Electronic Component 
Industries Association (Elcina), the delegation is inspired by 
the soaring demand for components in the Chinese electronics 
industry and that China could be a future source for some 
critical components and inputs for the indian industry at very 
competitive prices. 
  The delegation will also explore business opportunities and 
study the sweeping changes in China's special economic zones. 
  It will also visit a number of factories and examine 
benchmark of infrastructure and cost, and compare the export and 
import policies and incentives of the two countries. [sentence 
as received] 
  Telecom is another area where the delegation will be doing a 
lot of exploration. 
  India and China are slated to contribute the maximum number 
of telephone lines in the world telecom network in the next six 
years and the delegation will be comparing notes with their 
Chinese counterparts.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 3 (XINHUA) -- India hopes the 
growing Sino-Indian relations would receive "a cultural thrust" 
with the first ever foreign cultural exposition opening in 
Beijing on May 9. 
  This was expressed by the Indian Human Resource Development 
Minister Arjun Singh last night when he was addressing a press 
conference here. 
  The minister will inaugurate the festival which opens with 
the performing arts components stringed together to play up the 
main theme of "harmony." 
  The festival would last for 51 days. It was devised by the 
Indian Council for Cultural Relations as a multi-discipline 
extravaganza covering fine arts and folk arts, handicrafts and 
textiles, a seminar on literary traditions with eminent writers 
participating and an exhibition on English books published in 
India. 
  A fashion show with emphasis on Indian motifs in 
contemporary 
garments and a film festival with eight feature films would also 
take place. 
  India and China can benefit through mutual cooperation as 
both the nations have deep cultural relations and common 
interests, the Chinese Ambassador to India Cheng Ruisheng said 
while addressing the Fifth National Conference of Indo-China 
Friendship Society here yesterday. 
  He welcomed the exchange of cultural and other delegations 
between the two countries for closer understanding. 
  India is the first country ever to make a major cultural 
appearance in China in its recent history.

  [Text] The opening ceremony for an exhibition on the facts 
of the Sino-U.S. Cooperation Institute concentration camp [a 
camp run by U.S. and Kuomintang forces for the imprisonment of 
political dissidents, including communists, during the late 
1940's] was held yesterday morning [4 May]. The exhibition was 
sponsored by such units as the provincial party committee's 
propaganda department, with the help of the provincial museum 
and Chongqing's Keleshan Cemetery for Revolutionary Martyrs. 
The exhibition displays 300 or so copies of photos, and close 
to 100 precious historical relics. These things left behind by 
history show the past facts of the heroic struggle carried out 
by the proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation in 
order to make the Chinese revolution a success, as well as the 
monstrous crimes committed by Chinese and foreign reactionaries 
in the concentration camp. These vivid, lively, and moving 
exhibits are lively material with which to conduct education in 
patriotism, and will play a positive role in training youngsters 
to love the motherland, will foster lofty ideals, and will 
enrich the building of socialist spiritual civilization. 
  At the ceremony, more than 4,000 persons viewed the 
exhibition, including party, government, and Army leaders from 
the province and cities; officers and men of the People's 
Liberation Army and armed police; and pupils from Xining's 
(Xiacheng) and (Beiguan) district primary schools.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Members of a United 
States expedition in search of the wreckage of an American B-25 
bomber met Wednesday [4 May] in Xiangshan County, Zhejiang 
Province, with Chinese citizens who rescued American pilots 52 
years ago. 
  The 19-member expedition, headed by Bryan Moon, former 
vice-president of Northwest Airlines of the United States, has 
ended its search of the wreckage of the No. 15 bomber in the 
Xiangshan Bay. 
  Commanded by General Doolittle, a squadron of U.S. bombers 
launched America's first air strike on Tokyo during World War II 
on April 18, 1942. 
  The bombers were scheduled to land at the airport in Quzhou, 
Zhejiang Province, but lost contact with the airport while 
returning from their mission. 
  The airmen had to parachute from their planes after they ran 
out of fuel. 
  It has been verified that six bombers crashed in Zhejiang 
Province and that 27 airmen were rescued by local residents and 
returned home, while three died. 
  Three bombers crashed in the sea off Xiangshan County near 
Ningbo city. Ten airmen in bombers No. 7 and No. 15 were 
rescued by local residents, and returned home. 
  Two airmen of No. 6 bomber were drowned and three others 
were 
rescued. While escorting the pilots to the rear, ten local 
residents were shot dead by Japanese soldiers. 
  Attending the meeting on May 4 were seven local residents 
participating in the rescue operation 52 years ago and three 
descendents of the rescuers. 
  Two of the seven rescuers are 82 years old and two are 
women. 
  Also attending was Henry Potter, 76, a pilot in the squadron 
commanded by General Doolittle. Potter is a member of the 
American expedition. 
  On behalf of the rescued pilots, their families and the 
American people, Moon extended sincere thanks to the Chinese 
rescuers and their descendents. 
  Two American expedition members read two letters of thanks 
on 
behalf of Ted Lawson, a crewman with the No. 7 bomber, and 
Griffith Williams, a crewman of the No. 15 bomber, respectively. 
  Other members gave the rescuers badges in commemoration of 
the friendship between the Chinese and American peoples. 
  The expedition members and rescuers vowed to carry forward 
the friendship cemented 52 years ago.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- Tian Zengpei, Chinese 
vice-minister of foreign affairs, summoned U.S. Ambassador 
Stapleton Roy here today, and lodged a strong protest with the 
United States against its Foreign Relations Authorization Act. 
  Tian said that on 28 April, the United States Congress 
passed 
the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 1994 and 
1995, which was signed by the U.S. President on 30 April. 
  When this bill was being discussed, the Chinese side 
expressed serious concern over the anti-China provisions and 
made several solemn representations with the U.S. side, Tian 
said, adding that "We pointed out to the U.S side that these 
provisions, which had severely infringed on China's sovereignty 
and constituted a gross interference in China's internal 
affairs, would cause serious damage to Sino-U.S. relations." 
  The U.S. side, however, in disregard of the Chinese side's 
strong opposition and representations, went ahead with the 
passage and signature of this bill that contains many provisions 
detrimental to China's fundamental interests. This can not but 
arouse great indignation of the Chinese people, the 
vice-minister said. 
  "I am hereby instructed to lodge a strong protest with the 
United States Government on this issue", Tian said. 
  It is known to all that there is only one China and that 
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, he said, and the 
government of the People's Republic of China, as the sole legal 
government representing the whole of China, is recognized by the 
United Nations and the international community. 
  With regard to the Taiwan question, Tian said, the U.S. 
Government has made unambiguous commitment in the three 
Sino-U.S. Joint communiques, and is therefore bound by its 
international obligations. But the authorization act states 
that "Section 3 of the Taiwan Relations Act takes primacy over 
statements of government policies, including communiques, 
regulations, directives and policies based thereon," thus openly 
trampling on the communique of 17 August 1982 between the 
Chinese and U.S. Governments and seriously undermining the basis 
of Sino-U.S. relations. 
  The vice-minister said that the act also advocates visits by 
U.S. cabinet-level officials to Taiwan and calls on the U.S. 
President to take steps to express clearly U.S. support to 
Taiwan in bilateral relations and multilateral organizations of 
which the United States is a member. 
  "This is a deliberate attempt to create `two Chinas,' `one 
China and one Taiwan' in the international arena that completely 
contravenes the U.S. Government's commitment to pursue a `one 
China' policy," Tian said, and this attempt by the U.S. side to 
sabotage China's peaceful reunification and create tension in 
the Taiwan Straits will certainly meet with the resolute 
position of the Chinese people including our Taiwan compatriots, 
and is doomed to failure. 
  The vice foreign minister also said that Tibet has always 
been an inseparable part of China ever since the 13th century, 
and no country in the world, including the United States, 
recognizes Tibet as an independent country. But the act openly 
refers to Tibet as a "country," alleging that Tibet is an 
"occupied sovereign country" and "its true representatives are 
the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile." 
  He said that it is indeed shocking to see such contempt for 
the basic norms governing international relations, such open 
infringement of China's sovereignty and such an attempt to split 
China. 
  The Chinese people waged protracted and arduous struggles to 
safeguard their state sovereignty and territorial integrity, 
Tian said, and all attempts to split Tibet from the Chinese 
territory have ended in total failure with no exception. 
  "Anyone who still wants to follow this beaten track today 
will certainly come to grief", Tian said, and "We appeal [yao 
qiu 6008 3061] to the U.S. Government to strictly adhere to its 
openly stated position that Tibet is part of China and undertake 
not to get involved in any activities aimed at splitting China. 
  On the "Radio Free Asia", Tian said, China and many other 
Asian countries, and to create confusion to undermine stability 
in these countries. This act, however, approves the setting up 
of such a radio. 
  Tian said that this action once again shows no regard for 
the 
universally acknowledged norms governing international relations 
and violates the principles enshrined in the three-joint 
communiques between China and the United States. It is bound to 
meet the resolute opposition from the Chinese people and the 
peoples of other Asian countries. 
  Tian pointed out that Sino-U.S. relations are at a crucial 
moment right now, and "We hope that they will move in a positive 
direction." 
  However, he said, it depends on the joint efforts of both 
sides to improve and develop the bilateral relations. 
  The above-mentioned contents of the foreign relations 
authorization act seriously undermines the basis of Sino-U.S. 
relations, runs counter to the fundamental interests of both 
countries and peoples, and are inconsistent with the statement 
by the U.S. Government that it wants to develop a positive and 
constructive relationship with China. 
  The vice-minister said that China hereby states in all 
seriousness that all the anti-China sections in this act are 
absolutely objectionable and unacceptable [jian jue fan dui he 
jue dui bu neng jie shou di 1017 0414 0646 1417 0735 4815 1417 
0008 5174 2234 0649 4104] to the Chinese Government and people. 
And "We demand that the U.S. Government honor its words and 
adopt effective measures to reverse its wrong position and 
erroneous decision [gai bian qi cuo wu li chang he jue ding 2395 
6239 0366 6934 6137 4539 1034 0735 0414 1353] so as to strictly 
adhere to the principles enshrined in the three joint 
communiques between the two countries and the basic norms 
governing international relations." 
  Otherwise, he warned, the U.S. side shall be held 
responsible 
for all the consequences arising therefrom.

  [Text] Washington, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
today unveiled a set of new guidelines on its selective 
participation in global peacekeeping missions that stresses U.S. 
command and improved UN peacekeeping capabilities. 
  The guidelines, product of a government policy review that 
started in the previous administration, was signed by President 
Bill Clinton earlier this week, National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake said. 
  "The central conclusion of the study is that properly 
conceived and well-executed peacekeeping can be a very important 
and useful tool of American foreign policy," Lake told a press 
briefing at the White House. 
  Under the guidelines, Lake said, Washington would seek to: 
  -- Ensure that the United States supports "the right 
operations." The U.S. would only support or take part in 
missions that advance U.S. interests and the operations should 
have clear mandate, objectives and with forces and funds 
available. 
  -- Reduce the cost of peacekeeping. The U.S. now pays for 
less than one-third of UN peacekeeping operations. Lake urged 
"other newly-rich countries" to "pay their fair share." 
  -- Improve UN peacekeeping capabilities, enhancing planning, 
logistics, procurement, command and control, public affairs, 
intelligence and civilian policing. 
  -- To ensure that there is effective command and control of 
American forces when they are engaged in peacekeeping operations. 
  "The President will never relinquish command of United 
States 
forces," said Lieutenant General Wesley Clark, director for 
strategic plans and policy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
  "That is inviolable" although U.S. troops could be under 
"operational control" of foreign commanders, Clark told the same 
press briefing. 
  "The larger the U.S. military role, the more likely that the 
operations involved entail combat, then the less likely we are 
to place those forces under foreign operational control," Clark 
said.

  [Text] Washington, May 5 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
Defense William Perry denied today that the Pentagon is planning 
to delay closure of some bases until after the 1996 elections. 
  "We plan to go ahead with a vigorous base closing in 1995. 
And we will propose to close as many bases as we can 
effectively and efficiently execute," Perry said in a radio 
interview. 
  There were reports in recent days that the Clinton 
administration is considering the move so as not to inflict 
economic pains to some of the communities and to alienate voters 
there in the 1996 elections. 
  Last year, Congress approved, and President Bill Clinton 
signed, recommendations to close 130 military bases and scale 
back 45 others around the United States. 
  According to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment 
Commission that made the recommendations, the base closures will 
save the U.S. Treasury about four billion dollars from fiscal 
1994 to 1999. 
  After the year 2000, the U.S. is expected to save about 2.3 
billion dollars each year as a result of the base closings.

  [Text] Washington, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Independent 
prosecutor Robert Fiske, who is investigating the Whitewater 
affair, today subpoenaed all White House documents relating to 
Vincent Foster, the White House deputy counsel who police say 
committed suicide last July 20. 
  "The White House will cooperate fully and promptly," White 
House special counsel Lloyd Cutler said. 
  The sweeping subpoena seemed aimed at determining if any 
documents were taken from Foster's White House office or 
concealed from investigators after his body was found last July 
20 in a park outside Washington. 
  U.S. President Clinton told reporters today that he did not 
know anything about the subpoena when asked if he would claim 
executive privilege to withhold any of the documents. 
  As part of his probe of financial and land dealings 
involving 
Clinton and his wife Hillary when the President was Arkansas 
governor, Fiske is looking into whether the White House 
interfered with authorities investigating the Foster tragedy. 
  Sources familiar with the case said Wednesday [4 May] that 
the independent prosecutor has concluded Foster did, in fact, 
commit suicide, and that Fiske would soon issue a report 
wrapping up that part of his probe. 
  U.S. Park police had previously determined that Foster, a 
long-time friend of the Clintons, shot himself last July 20 in 
the suburban park. Files were removed from his office in the 
White House shortly after his body was found, and Bernard 
Nussbaum, then White House counsel, reviewed other documents 
before they were given to police investigators. 
  It was disclosed last year that some of the documents taken 
from Foster's office concerned the Whitewater Development 
Corporation, a failed Arkansas real estate venture in which the 
Clintons held half interest. 
  White House deputy counsel Joel Klein said today that the 
Whitewater documents were initially turned over to Donald 
Kendall, the Clintons' personal lawyer, and that others had been 
given to foster's family lawyer. 
  Questions have also been raised about whether White House 
aides tried to conceal some of Foster's documents. 
  The White House sought to portray Fiske's latest demand as 
routine, but it appears to signal a widening of the 
investigation. 
  In the U.S. Senate, 40 republicans urged their leader Bob 
Dole to confront Democratic leader George Mitchell with the 
proposal that Whitewater hearings begin within 30 days. 
  Both the Senate and the House have passed resolutions 
calling 
for Whitewater hearings, leaving it up to the leaders of the two 
parties to decide when they can be held without interfering with 
Fiske's investigation.

  [Text] Singapore, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Singapore said today 
that it would be regrettable if the execution of caning on 
American teenage vandal Michael Fay were allowed to affect 
Singapore-U.S. relations. 
  "It world be regrettable if the actions of one individual, 
Michael Fay, who had transgressed Singapore law and been 
punished according to the law, were allowed to affect bilateral 
relations," a spokesman of the Foreign Ministry said. 
  Singapore had to enforce its laws impartially, whether 
Singaporeans, Americans or other foreigners were involved, he 
stressed. 
  The spokesman made the comments when responding to the 
statement by Christine Shelly, acting spokesperson for the U.S. 
State Department on Thursday [5 May]. 
  In her statement, Christine Shelly said that Assistant 
Secretary of State Winston Lord met with Singapore Ambassador to 
the United States S.R. Nathan on Thursday and informed the 
ambassador that President Bill Clinton "was very disappointed" 
by Singapore's decision to "deny clemency to Michael Fay". 
  Fay, 18, was caned at the Queenstown Remand Prison in 
Singapore on Thursday for vandalism. He was originally 
sentenced to six strokes of caning in early March. But the 
Singapore Government announced on Wednesday that the country 
decided exceptionally to reduce the punishment from six to four 
strokes of the cane to accommodate Clinton's concern over the 
case. 
  Clinton had written to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong, 
asking for commuting Fay's sentence of the cane and expressed 
his concerns over the case three times in the public. 
  In his meeting with Ambassador Nathan, which was described 
as 
"frank and candid", Lord also warned that this incident of Fay 
"will have to be taken into account in the overall relationship 
between the U.S. and Singapore," Shelly said. 
  The spokesman of Singapore Foreign Ministry said however 
that 
he believed that U.S.-Singapore ties "were robust enough to 
weather any difficulties caused by Michael Fay's caning." 
  "The U.S. and Singapore have always enjoyed a strong 
relationship, based on many common interests and shared 
strategic objectives," he said. 
  He said he hoped that "both sides would focus on their 
larger 
mutual interests and put this incident behind them".

  [Text] As of today, a five-day "Canada Week" is being 
observed simultaneously in the Guangdong cities of Guangzhou, 
Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. 
  This morning, accompanied by Vice Governor Zhong Qiquan, 
Canadian Governor-General Ramon John Hnatyshyn, who had arrived 
in Guangzhou especially to observe the "Canada Week," attended a 
symposium in Guangzhou on the development of relations between 
Canada and the Zhujiang Delta, as well as a ribbon-cutting 
ceremony marking the official commissioning of Guangdong's block 
code exchange system. 
  At the symposium on developing Canada-Zhujiang Delta 
relations, Hnatyshyn warmly praised the friendly relations 
between Canada and Guangdong, saying that a large number of 
Canadian Chinese who are natives of Guangdong Province have made 
enormous contributions to the development of Canada's highways 
and telecommunications, as well as its minerals prospecting. 
  The Canadian governor-general expressed his hope that Canada 
and Guangdong will take steps to strengthen academic exchanges 
so as to enhance mutual understanding and lay a solid foundation 
for continued cultural and economic exchanges. 
  Guangdong's block code exchange system was built with 
Canadian loans and with technology provided by Canada's North 
Electric Power Corporation.

  [Text] Singapore, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The Singapore 
Government and Singapore companies are optimistic about the 
economic outlook for China, and are "deeply impressed" by 
China's achievements, Ker Sin Tze, minister of state for 
information and the arts, said here today. 
  The Singapore Government and Singapore companies are also 
"confident that China's policies of modernisation and growth are 
irreversible," Ker, who is also the minister of state for 
education, said at the official launch of the manpower training 
programme for Shandong personnel. 
  Noting that the economic relations between China and 
Singapore have progressed steadily, Ker revealed that Singapore 
companies have invested nearly one billion U.S. dollars in 
China, cumulatively. 
  In 1993, bilateral trade expanded by 25 percent to reach a 
record of 4.3 billion U.S. dollars, he said, adding that in the 
first two months of this year, trade between the two countries 
had already exceeded 625 million U.S. dollars, or 30 percent 
more than the same period of 1993. 
  He also said that the cooperation between Singapore and 
China's Shandong Province created ample opportunities for trade 
and investments, not only for the two countries, but also for 
bringing in third countries like Germany into partnership to 
develop the potential of Shandong Province. 
  The German state of Bavaria has signed a letter of intent 
with Singapore and Shandong Province to explore possibilities 
for greater tripartite economic cooperation. 
  In regard to the manpower training programme for Shandong 
personnel, the minister said," It is an important component of 
Singapore's economic ties with Shandong," since Singapore is 
ready to share its know-how in economic management, urban 
planning and public administration with China. 
  "Singapore's experience may be relevant to China at its 
present stage of modernisation, if it is adapted to fit China's 
conditions and needs," he said.

  [Text] Jinan, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Economic and trade 
co-operation between east China's Shandong Province and 
Singapore is booming. 
  By the end of last year the economically-developed province 
had approved the establishment of 230 enterprises funded by 
Singapore business people. 
  The first such enterprise was set up in 1985. 
  A provincial official in charge of foreign investment said 
that Singapore-funded projects are on a large scale, with the 
contracted investment averaging 2.6 million U.S. dollars. 
  Of the projects concluded last year, the official noted, 123 
were Sino-Singapore joint ventures and 27 were solely funded by 
the Singapore side. 
  These projects are distributed in 16 prefectures and cities, 
with the coastal cities of Qingdao, Yantai and Weihai being the 
main locations. They are involved in the fields of food 
processing, textiles, building materials, electronics, real 
estate, tourism and information consultancy. 
  Last year saw Shandong's foreign trade with Singapore total 
220 million U.S. dollars, accounting for three percent of the 
province's total.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Li Lanqing 
said at a recent work meeting of the China Import Automobile 
Trade Center: While China permits multichannel import of 
automobiles, an important category of important goods, we should 
have a main channel for the import. In this way, it will 
benefit both our macroeconomic management and the healthy 
development of the automobile industry. 
  Li Lanqing said: In our automobile industry, the development 
of medium-sized cars is quite healthy and the production of 
heavy vehicles has no big problem either. The production of 
light cars has many problems. There are 125 light automobile 
plants in China. They are too dispersed in production, using 
only a small proportion of Chinese-made parts, and they are 
disorderly in operation, low in technological level, and poor in 
quality. They have taken a great deal of investment, but they 
have not yet been able to engage in large-scale production. Had 
the investment been made in a more concentrated way, we could 
have built some very good large automobile production bases. 
  Li Lanqing said: Automobile industry is a pillar industry 
and China attaches high priority to its development. Since the 
departments concerned have already formulated the policy for the 
development of the automobile industry, we should promote its 
healthy development with the policy henceforth. Since imported 
cars are just a supplementary to Chinese-made cars, we should 
pay attention to import of technologies. The China Import 
Automobile Trade Center, as the main channel of our country's 
automobile import, should offer a good service. Its business 
policy should be one of earning small profits, not big profits. 
It should avoid bureaucratic ways in business operation and 
should create the image of an honest and reliable enterprise. 
  The China Import Automobile Trade Center is an economic 
entity with a legal person's status, set up with the approval of 
the State Council. Its main tasks are to participate in market 
regulation, stabilize automobile prices, import both technology 
and automobiles, and promote the healthy development of 
automobile industry. Since its establishment in June 1993, it 
has handled the marketing of 14,000 automobiles which the 
Chinese Government bought from the United States. It has helped 
the government departments concerned in the sale and management 
of confiscated smuggled automobiles and in formulating relevant 
procedures for the sale and management. It also conducts 
legitimate bonded car import and barter trade. Vice Premier Li 
Lanqing affirmed its business achievements.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- Agriculture Minister Liu 
Jiang said: The current overall situation in agriculture and the 
rural economy is good. It should be soberly noted, however, 
that there are problems in further development. The stress of 
our future rural work is to be put on deepening rural reform, 
effectively developing the rural economy, raising peasants' 
incomes, and maintaining social stability. 
  Liu Jiang today made a report on the current situation in 
agriculture and the rural economy at a reporting meeting 
sponsored by the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central 
Committee, the Work Committee for Organs Under the CPC Central 
Committee, the Work Committee for Organs Under the State 
Council, the General Political Department of the People's 
Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee. He 
said: With the implementation of policy measures taken by the 
party Central Committee and the State Council to support 
agricultural production and protect peasants' interests in the 
past year, the rural economy maintained a good momentum of 
development; grain output has topped 450 billion jin, an 
all-time high; the output of most cash crops, except cotton and 
oil-bearing crops, went up; products related to the "vegetable 
basket" project continue to increase; village and town 
enterprises developed rapidly, with better economic performance; 
peasants's incomes continue to rise, and their burdens were 
reduced to some extent; and rural reform continued to deepen, 
and market forces played an increasingly important role in the 
rural economy. 
  On problems in the development of agriculture and the rural 
economy, Liu Jiang considered the following to be major 
problems: 1) The effective supply of farm products is not stable 
enough. With scarcity of land and a large population, our 
country's increased agricultural production is offset by an 
increase in the population. The average per capita consumption 
of farm products is low, and the distribution of farm products 
in areas and the structure of their varieties are uneven. Prices 
sometimes fluctuate rather sharply. 2) The increase of 
peasants'incomes has been slow in the past few years, which has 
affected their input into agricultural production and the 
expansion of rural markets. 3) The pressure of rural surplus 
manpower for employment has increased. He said: Conscientious 
efforts should be made to solve institutional or deep-seated 
problems in the development of the rural economy, such as 
insufficient investment, the increasing disparity in prices 
between industrial goods and agricultural produce, backward 
scientific and technological education, and unsound rural 
management and operation systems. 
  Liu Jiang stressed: The major tasks in future rural work are 
to deepen rural reform, effectively develop the rural economy, 
raise peasants' incomes, and maintain social stability. He 
said: To effectively develop the economy, it is necessary, first 
of all, to do a good job in cotton production, make the 
"vegetable basket" project a success, stabilize grain 
production, and ensure the effective supply of farm products. 
Peasants' incomes are one of the crucial issues in rural work 
in the 1990's. Without a steady increase in peasants' incomes, 
their input into agriculture cannot possibly increase, nor can 
rural markets expand. The basic way to raise peasants' incomes 
is to deepen reform, accelerate the development of the rural 
economy, and increase their incomes with increased production. 
He emphasized: For rural areas, it is essential to lighten 
peasants' burdens, help them free themselves from poverty, 
vigorously rectify various unhealthy trends about which people 
have a lot of complaints, strengthen the building of basic-level 
rural organizations, and gradually narrow the gap between the 
eastern and western regions of the country in order to maintain 
social stability. 
  Liu Jiang: We should step up our work in five aspects to 
develop agriculture and the rural economy: 1) We should further 
improve our policies to protect and support agriculture. 2) 
Keeping in mind the goal of establishing a socialist market 
economic structure, we should further deepen rural reform, 
particularly improve the grain purchasing and selling policies 
and the basic rural management system, guide the sound 
development of the cooperative share holding system, and deepen 
the reform of the rural banking system. 3) We should promote 
scientific and technological progress in rural areas and develop 
agriculture through the development of science, technology, and 
education. 4) We should clearly define our responsibilities and 
vigorously implement policies. 5) The whole party should pay 
close attention to agriculture, and society as a whole should 
concern itself with it.

  [Text] Nice, France, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The Asian 
Development Bank is close to doubling the amount of capital it 
will make available in loans in the 1994-1999 period to 48 
billion U.S. dollars, according to the bank's 27th annual 
meeting held May 2-5 here. 
  However, the plan is overshadowed by disputes between some 
Asian countries and the United States over whether some policy 
preconditions should be linked to loan provisions. 
  The United States also wants to see more money entEr social 
projects, such as anti-poverty programs, improvement of women's 
status, environment protection and family planning. 
  This position was disputed by India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, 
Thailand, Laos, the Philippines, and China. 
  These countries insist that loan provisions should not be 
linked with policy preconditions. 
  Bank president Mitsuo Sato said the bank would try to help 
solve the dispute. 
  The bank's board of governors will vote on May 22 on the 
capital boost plan. 
  The meeting was attended by 225 delegates from the bank's 55 
member nations. Economic reconstruction, approaches to economic 
expansion, and challenges facing Asian nations were the topics 
which dominated the discussions. 
  A consensus at the gathering is that the Asian-Pacific 
region 
has made a large contribution to global economic recovery. 
  The Asian countries realized an average rise of 7 percent in 
their gross domestic production (GDP) despite a world-wide 
recession in 1993. 
  The meeting also called on member states to settle problems 
challenging economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region where 
unbalanced economic development, a shortage of capital, poverty, 
a deteriorating environment, and population pressure are serious 
obstacles to further growth. 
  Some representatives have asked for lower interest on loans, 
an augmented capital flow, and greater help for those countries 
which are lagging behind. 
  Zhou Shengqing, deputy governor of the People's Bank of 
China, also attended the meeting.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 5 (XINHUA) -- A symposium on 
Intellectual Property Rights Protection (IPR) is to be held in 
Beijing on May 20 and 21, one of the event's leading organizers, 
Intel-Property Protect Services (China) Ltd., announced here 
today. The 1994 symposium on intellectual property protection 
will cover a range of issues dealing with patent, trademark and 
copyright protection in China, Vice Chairperson of the company 
Ms. Maria Tam Wai Chu said at a press conference this afternoon. 
Speakers at the symposium include representatives from 
Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Coudert Brothers, the World Intellectual

<F P=106> [Article by Chang Mu (1728 3092): "CPC Redefines Positions </F>
of Political and Economic Reforms; Reform and Opening Will Make 
Moderate Progress"] 
  [Excerpt] At present, economic operations and structural 
reforms in Mainland China have come to a point of stagnation. 
The comprehensive reform program adopted earlier this year, and 
aimed at making major breakthroughs in shifting from the planned 
to the market economy, is now facing a range of difficulties. 
It is believed that, after tiding over mountains of 
difficulties, the situation will become bright again. The 
difficulties are mainly reflected in the following: Prices are 
increasing by too big a margin and state-owned enterprises are 
operating under more difficult conditions (because their 
economic results are getting even worse, their business losses 
are increasing, their debt chains are accumulating, the income 
of their workers is decreasing, and there are great difficulties 
in their social insurance arrangements). A potential crisis 
exists in agricultural production, which is vitally important to 
the people's livelihood, because it is affected by market 
competition. In addition, sensitive and unstable factors exist 
in the months of April, May, and June. The CPC top leadership 
thus emphasized the need to advance reform in an orderly way and 
coordinate reform with development and stability under the 
precondition of maintaining the current political framework. 
  In such circumstances, the CPC authorities have obviously 
replaced the previous guideline of laying equal stress on 
economic and political reforms with the general policy decision 
of taking economic construction as the central task and making 
everything suit the needs of the economic structural reform, to 
implement Deng Xiaoping's line and accelerate the establishment 
of the socialist market economic structure. Qian Qichen, vice 
premier of the State Council and foreign minister, announced 
that without continuous economic growth, it is difficult to 
develop democracy. This precisely reflected the policy 
orientation of the third-generation CPC leading body. 
  Premier Li Peng said recently: In the course of gradually 
establishing the socialist market economic structure, China also 
attaches great importance to developing democracy and the legal 
system and boosting spiritual civilization. China pays 
attention to adopting and assimilating advanced scientific and 
technological achievements, management expertise, and cultural 
achievements from foreign countries; at the same time, it also 
pays attention to resisting decadent things. In particular, 
China pays attention to maintaining its fine national tradition 
and the cream of its national culture. This can be viewed as an 
explicit definition of the contents and orientation of the 
political structural reform, as well its position of being 
subordinate to and guaranteeing the economic reform. Therefore, 
Li Peng pointed out that the CPC's plan was to basically 
establish the new economic structure in the 1990's and then 
further build up a set of mature and fixed systems in various 
aspects through efforts over the following 20 years. 
  In a previous period, the opinions about "greatly developing 
the nonpublic economy" and establishing "a new type of mixed 
economy" prevailed. Some people even advocated that like 
planning and market, the system of ownership is also a means and 
that only economic development is the end. They called for 
respecting the independent status and interests of commodity 
producers and dealers, arguing that the market economy is in 
essence linked only with private ownership. At a theoretical 
symposium on the private economy, a private entrepreneur read an 
essay entitled "Keep Wealth in the Hands of the People--the Only 
Way To Make a Country Prosperous and Powerful." He asserted 
that "China is now undergoing the process of relative 
privatization." This is characterized by the fact that "the 
proportion of the private economy among other economic elements 
in society is increasing and private enterprises are becoming 
main pay contributors in the country" and "an increasing number 
of individuals have, and will, become shareholders or owners of 
former state-owned enterprises." As a result, "private property 
is dramatically increasing" in society. He also held that the 
countryside is the "source of privatization" and "the adoption 
of the production responsibility system based on output 
contracts has become the prelude to the process of 
privatization." "As a result of the reforms, private 
enterprises appeared on the Chinese mainland, a group of native 
capitalists were fostered, and foreign capitalists were brought 
in together with their investments." The essay said: "By the 
end of this century, with the return of Hong Kong and Macao, the 
private economy in the mainland will gain a natural ally and the 
unexpected convergence will make the number of China's national 
capitalists more impressive." 
  Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "We allow the individual 
economy to develop and also allow Sino-foreign joint ventures 
and the enterprises solely owned by foreign investors to develop 
but socialist public ownership should always be the mainstay of 
the economy." He stressed that "in the course of reform, we 
should always adhere to basic principles: One is to keep the 
dominant position of the public economy and the other is to seek 
common affluence." Therefore, the 14th CPC National 
Congress drew a particularly explicit conclusion: "In the 
ownership structure, public ownership, including the economy 
under whole people ownership and collective ownership, will be 
the mainstay and the individual economy, the private economy, 
the foreign-funded economy will be supplementary, and a variety 
of economic elements will develop, side by side, over a long 
period of time." 
  In fact, the state-owned economy remains the main source of 
tax revenue for the state, accounting for about 60 to 70 percent 
of the total. The private economy is still far from being the 
main taxpayer. Some experts hold that the fact that the 
economic results in some state-owned enterprises are poor and 
some even incur serious business losses is caused, to a large 
extent, by the unfair competition. It is a biased opinion to 
say that state-owned enterprises cannot match collective 
enterprises, that collective enterprises cannot match private 
enterprises, that private enterprises cannot match 
foreign-funded enterprises, and that private ownership is 
superior to public ownership. A large part of state-owned 
enterprises are concentrated in the basic industries. They 
require high investments and are slow to yield returns, their 
products and services are sold at low prices, and thus their 
profit margins are lower than the average level in society. In 
fact, part of their economic results are transferred to private 
enterprises and their low economic efficiency guarantees the 
high efficiency of the national economy as a whole, including 
that of the private economy. State-owned enterprises employ 20 
to 30 percent more workers than they actually need. They also 
have to bear the wages and welfare benefits paid to an 
increasing number of retired personnel and the load is getting 
increasingly heavy. On the other hand, the township and town 
enterprises, private enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises 
only need to pay the labor costs and they shift the welfare 
burdens onto society. In the process of accelerating the 
establishment of the market economic structure, the state-owned 
enterprises have lost their advantages in raw materials and in 
production costs but they still have to shoulder heavy burdens. 
On the other hand, the township and town enterprises, private 
enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises can enjoy various 
preferential tax terms. More importantly, although the 
management and operation mechanisms of the state-owned 
enterprises have been transformed somewhat, they are still 
subject to administrative interference and it is still hard for 
them to actually exercise independent decisionmaking power in 
investment, production distribution, personnel appointment, and 
price-fixing. Naturally, they cannot adapt themselves flexibly 
to the market economy. 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, who is now in charge of the reform 
oriented to the establishment of the modern enterprise system, 
said that as long as the management and operation mechanisms of 
the state-owned enterprises have been thoroughly changed, such 
enterprises are given independent decisionmaking power for 
business operations; their property rights are explicitly 
defined; a reasonable internal organizational structure, the 
stimulating and self-control mechanisms, and the environment for 
fair competition are set up; and then they will also be able to 
achieve high economic efficiency. Privatization is never the 
only way out. Public ownership is not the cause of the poor 
economic results. The current economic difficulties in Western 
countries also proves this. 
  With the in-depth development of the economy, individual 
investment in state-owned enterprises will increase and 
individual investors will become shareholders in such 
enterprises. Moreover, some small- and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises will be sold to individuals by auction. The CPC 
authorities stress that this does not mean any privatization of 
state-owned enterprises; instead, this is just a measure for 
deepening the enterprise reform and invigorating the economy. 
According to the relevant state regulations, the proportion of 
shares held by individuals is limited and public ownership will 
remain predominant. Deng Xiaoping said: "According to the 
current practice of opening, there will not be a newborn 
bourgeois class when our country's per capita GNP increases to 
several thousand dollars." "If there is a newborn bourgeois 
class then we will have really gone astray." 
  Among CPC cadres at all levels, there are many different 
opinions about the country's development orientation and about 
the contents and intensity of the reforms; there are also 
differences in the implementation of the established policies. 
Many cadres only stress the need to quicken development and do 
not pay attention to various new economic phenomena and the 
implementation of various reform measures. Some of them are 
even tired of so many "twists and turns." 
  CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin particularly instructed 
the 
State Council's Development Research Center, headed by Ma Hong 
and Sun Shangqing, to organize some experts in compiling 
textbooks for provincial, prefectural, city, township, and 
enterprises leaders to popularize knowledge about the socialist 
market economy among them. In early April, Jiang Zemin 
telephoned Ma Hong and said: The ongoing transformation from a 
traditional planned economic structure to a socialist market 
economic structure is a great historical change but leading 
cadres at all levels are still unclear about the basic facts and 
the basic concepts of the market economy. It is now urgently 
necessary to popularize the ABC's of the market economy, such as 
basic knowledge about stocks, bonds, real estate, and futures. 
In the past, our cadres learned little about such things while 
working under the planned economy structure but now, they must 
have knowledge about the market economy to develop the socialist 
market economy and must be familiar with the market and 
understand the contents and operation of the market economy in 
order to do a good job. 
  Since the beginning of this year, principal provincial-level 
leading cadres have received training in turn at the CPC 
High-Level Party School led by Hu Jintao. They mainly studied 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and 
the major principles and policies for establishing the socialist 
market economy and the reform arrangements. In particular, 
stress was laid on the need to unify thinking, to coordinate the 
steps, to act in accordance with the overall interests of the 
whole nation, and to safeguard the authority of the central 
leadership. As a result, such things as ignoring central 
instructions, working out "countermeasures" against central 
policies, taking advantage of loopholes in the policies, and 
going one's own way have been seen to decrease. 
  After the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress, the CPC leaders inspected various localities to see 
how the reform measures were being implemented. Zhu Rongji's 
inspection of Heilongjiang was most impressive in terms of size 
and influence. He led 10 principal State Council ministry and 
state commission leaders to "work on the spot," dealing mainly 
with difficult issues in the economic layout and in large 
state-owned enterprises (including those in the war industry). 
Some enterprises were forced to suspend operations and 
production because of the industrial restructuring and 
enterprise mergers. Some workers gathered to protest and this 
caused a bad atmosphere. Zhu Rongji announced that he 
visited Heilongjiang in accordance with the instructions of 
Jiang Zemin and Li Peng. Thus, he brought with him the supreme 
policy decisions. At the end of the inspection, on 17 
April, he openly announced that Sun Weiben, secretary of the 
provincial party committee was relieved of office and would be 
succeeded by Yue Qifeng, former governor of Liaoning Province. 
This showed that Zhu Rongji was resolute in making decisions as 
a troubleshooter and could seize the crux of the problem. 
  Whether or not the CPC's reform measures for improving 
macrocontrol will achieve the expected results is contingent on 
whether or not social and economic operations can be kept in a 
healthy and stable condition during the first half of this year. 
Although the results of production, sales, tax revenue, and 
foreign trade in the first quarter of 1994 show that the 
economic conditions can basically meet the macrocontrol targets, 
retail prices still increased by 20.1 percent, much higher than 
Li Peng's target of keeping the margin of price increase within 
10 percent for the whole year. Chen Jihua, minister of the 
State Planning Commission, said that in order to curb inflation 
and guarantee the smooth implementation of various reform 
measures, it is necessary to effect the following: 
  First, maintaining the balance between gross supply and 
demand. In normal conditions, the difference should not be 
larger than 5 percent. At present, the difference is 7 percent. 
The investment-led demand is too great and supply is relatively 
insufficient and, if this situation continues, inflation will 
appear. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly control the 
amount of investment in fixed assets. 
  Second, attaching importance to agriculture and guaranteeing 
the supply of vegetables, eggs, meat, and other foodstuffs. 
Workers in the middle and lower income groups are strongly 
discontented with the fact that food prices are increasing by 
too wide a margin and this is greatly unfavorable to social 
stability. 
  Third, properly handling the intensity of the price reform 
and selecting the right time for the adoption of the reform 
measures. That is, the reform measures should be adopted when 
the economic environment is relatively relaxed and the masses 
can endure higher prices. Public opinion should help adjust the 
psychological condition of the masses for inflation. 
  Fourth, the government should be exercising management and 
interfering in market prices. At present, in such countries as 
the United States and Japan, which pursue typical free market 
economies, the commodity prices and service charges subject to 
government management account for 5 to 10 percent, or even 20 
percent, of the gross volume of retail sales in society and the 
proportions there are even higher than those in China. 
Therefore, macrocontrol over the conditions of a market economy 
is still indispensable. 
  Since Ding Guangen, CPC Central Political Bureau member, 
took charge of the party's ideological work, he has pointed out 
more explicitly the position of ideological and propaganda work 
as subordinate to the central task of economic construction and 
reforms. The position and role of opinion orientation is being 
strengthened and has become the important nerve of social 
stability. The CPC top leadership stressed that factors 
which may cause social instability must be wiped out when they 
are still in the embryonic stage to prevent them from causing 
major trouble. This is in fact the extensive application of 
Deng Xiaoping's idea about "no controversy." News reports, the 
arts, and other forms of propaganda should serve the central 
task, playing an assistant role, and must not add trouble to the 
situation. They should play the main theme and not add noise. 
This is the most important function of the propaganda methods. 
They must not create any unnecessary controversy or even sing 
an opposing tune to divert people's attention from economic 
construction. Stopping beauty pageants, stopping performers 
from moving all over to put on shows, checking young people's 
crazy admiration for some singing stars, clamping down on the 
illegal sale of book registration numbers and illegal 
publications, including pornographic publications, were all 
measures adopted by the CPC authorities to remove the unstable 
factors and resist the influence of the decadent Western 
lifestyle. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out that the first thing in 
building spiritual civilization is to cause creations to 
flourish and these works should play the main theme. The 
works should give expression to Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's 
basic line, and the spirit of patriotism, socialism, and 
collectivism. Literature and arts should follow the principle 
of "serving socialism" and "serving the people." In short, they 
should arouse the entire people's enthusiasm for socialist 
construction and should encourage them to make progress. The 
main theme must be played in the works being supported as key 
projects, in the main pages and columns of newspapers and 
magazines, and in the golden hours of television broadcasts. 
The main theme should be combined with a variety of vivid 
forms. The main theme is the ideological requirement for 
the works but the works giving expression to the main theme need 
not be serious or highly aesthetic in their style. Some works 
may be very easy to understand and should be popular with the 
masses. As long as they give a healthy feeling to the people, 
then they are works playing the main theme. We cannot demand 
that all works repeat the same thing and follow the same pattern 
while stressing the need to play the main theme. We should 
still let a hundred flowers blossom. We should also allow the 
existence of some works which are somewhat vulgar in style but 
are harmless in their contents. Jiang Zemin also said: We 
must boost spiritual civilization; otherwise, people at home and 
abroad can complain bitterly. For example, karaoke bars in some 
places hire young ladies to entertain customers by drinking, 
singing, and dancing with them. If there are additional 
services, things will become serious. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Sweeping away pornographic things is a 
popular action supported by the people, so we should go all out 
to do this boldly. Of course, this is also a long-term task 
that cannot be finished in one single move. It is necessary to 
mobilize all quarters of society to sweep away pornographic 
things, just like the tasks being assigned to all units in 
public sanitary work. The tasks of eliminating pornographic 
things should also be assigned to all institutions, schools, and 
enterprises and routine management should be combined with 
sudden inspections. Unremitting efforts should be made and 
actions should be taken repeatedly. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Special article" by intern reporter Chang Chun (1728 </F>
6511): "How Beijing Regulates and Controls Commodity Prices"] 
  [Text] As the number of marketization elements of the 
price formation mechanism continuously increases, 95 percent of 
the prices of commodities and charges for business services on 
the Chinese mainland have been liberalized and subjected to 
regulation by market mechanism. Since the second half of last 
year, prices of agricultural and sideline products, which have a 
bearing on residents' immediate interests, have been on the 
rise. In March this year, the prices of vegetables rose by 31 
percent over the same period last year. The top echelons of 
central leadership and local governments were very much 
concerned about residents' "shopping baskets." In an interview 
with this reporter, an official from the Beijing Municipal 
Commodity Price Bureau stressed: In the socialist market 
economy, the government interferes in market prices by 
comprehensively using economic and legal means as well as 
necessary administrative fiats. At the same time, he pointed 
out: The upward spiral of the prices of agricultural and 
sideline products is now slowing down. 
<H5>  Price Rises in the South Are Spreading to the North </H5>
  The prices of meat (pork, beef, and mutton), eggs, 
vegetables, grain, and edible oils were liberalized at the end 
of 1992 and on 5 March 1993. Overall price reform has promoted 
production growth, market circulation, and relative market 
stability. The masses of people are comparatively satisfied 
with the reform. Regulation of prices of agricultural and 
sideline products by the market is, in fact, the inevitable 
outcome of the price reform which has been introduced since 1979. 
  In late November and early December last year, prices of 
agricultural and sideline products represented by grain suddenly 
went up as a bumper grain harvest was reaped and grain in stock 
was abundant. This phenomenon, which started in the coastal 
areas of south China, spread to the northern regions of the 
country. In the first ten-day period of December, prices of 
grain and edible oils in Beijing were as follows: The price of 
high-quality wheat flour rose from seven jiao [one jiao=1/10 of 
a yuan] to more than 0.9 yuan or an increase of 30 percent, and 
that of edible oils rose from 3 yuan to 4.5 yuan a jin. The 
prices of pork and eggs saw relatively stable rises. 
  Zhao Chongjie, head of the Comprehensive Management Section 
under the Beijing Municipal Commodity Price Bureau and senior 
economist, maintained: There are three reasons behind the 
current price rises: 1) In November, grain-producing provinces 
gave advance warning that purchase prices of grain and edible 
oils would increase, with a view to guiding peasant enthusiasm 
for grain cultivation. However, as a result, grain and edible 
oils were sold grudgingly. 2) Departments engaged in the 
circulation sector lacked adaptive measures and necessary mental 
preparation for the readjustment of purchasing prices. 3) 
Consumers were apprehensive of the reform measures to be taken 
in the new year. For example, they thought that the additional 
collection of consumption tax would lead to a big rise in 
commodity prices. 
<H5>  The Municipal Government Strengthens Macroregulation and </H5>
Control 
  In view of this situation, the municipal government set up a 
market price monitoring and control system to forecast trends of 
price changes and promptly study measures to cope with the 
changed situation. On 19 December last year, after the 
government exercised macro-regulation and control on the 
limited-price management of 21 varieties of grain, edible oils, 
meat, eggs, and vegetables, market prices dropped quickly. The 
price of high-quality wheat flour dropped to 0.78 yuan per jin 
while that of edible oils steadied below the four-yuan level. 
Thanks to the imposition of price limits on the sale of grain, 
edible oils, meat, eggs, and vegetables, prices of agricultural 
and sideline products were brought under control, and the 
residents' inflation expectation mentality was alleviated 
considerably. Later on, after summing up the current management 
based on limited prices, the municipal government held: This 
was a successful practical exercise for the government to 
regulate and control prices by using economic means. 
  Mr. Zhao Chongjie said: It is believed that in the socialist 
market economy, commodity price departments are not essential. 
Through the imposition in December last year of management based 
on limited prices, importance was attached to the work of the 
commodity price bureau. It was universally held that even in 
market economy, the government also could not abandon an 
intervention role in prices. 

<H5>    Three Funds Function as Expected </H5>
  To coordinate with price reform, stabilize production, 
enliven circulation, and protect consumption, the municipal 
government set up three funds: Agricultural production, market 
risk, and commodity reserve funds. The agricultural production 
fund is used to protect agricultural production. When prices of 
agricultural products are on the low side and agriculture is 
beset with difficulties, the government will use the fund to 
reduce producers' losses. The market risk fund is used to curb 
commodity prices when prices undergo a sudden change. Last 
year, the Beijing municipal government used the market risk fund 
three times. One occasion was to ensure supplies during the 
Spring Festival holidays; another occasion were in August and 
September when vegetables were in the off season; the third 
occasion was the 15 million yuan used to cope with the sudden 
rise in grain prices. The third fund is a commodity reserve 
fund under which the government entrusts operating departments 
with responsibility for building up supplies of commodities to 
ensure them for the Beijing municipal population of 10 million 
people for a certain period. 
<H5>  This Year's Price Rises Are Expected Not to Exceed Last </H5>
Year's Levels 
  Mr. Zhao remarked: On the question of commodity prices, all 
sides concerned and opinion makers have basically reached a 
consensus on three aspects: 1) In the socialist market 
economy, price fluctuations are normal. As such, one should not 
be surprised so long as they are kept within a rational scope 
and are conducive to production, enhancement of national 
strength, and improvement of the national economy and the 
people's livelihood. 2) Government regulation and control of 
market prices is necessary. 3) So long as the relationship 
between price rises and improvement of the people's living 
standards is handled well and the residents' income growth is 
kept higher than the price rise levels, this will help stimulate 
the economy. He contended: The main reason prices of 
agricultural and sideline products rose significantly last year 
was that the previous base figures were relatively low. Now 
prices have been stabilizing. 
  Commodity prices in Beijing went up by 16.9 percent last 
year. This growth rate was higher than the nation's 16.4 percent 
level, but was considered low compared with that of the 35 large 
cities. As for the residents' consumption index and retail price 
index last month, they rose by 25 percent and 21 percent 
respectively. According to the estimate of the official from the 
commodity price bureau, this year's price-rise rate is not 
expected to exceed last year's level.

  [Text] Hefei, May 6 (XINHUA) -- China's rapid economic 
development and political and social stability have attracted 
strong foreign investment. 
  A recent national working meeting on the registration of 
foreign-funded enterprises here disclosed that foreign 
investment is expanding from the coastal areas to interior parts 
of the country. 
  A survey shows that China had 25,389 registered 
foreign-funded enterprises in 1990. Included were only 333, 
accounting for 1.3 percent of the total, in central and western 
parts of the country, and the Tibet Autonomous Region was a 
virtual blank check regarding foreign investment. 
  By the end of 1993, however, the number of foreign-funded 
enterprises in central and western China had climbed to 4,913, 
accounting for 2.9 percent of the total. 
  More and more large foreign-funded projects were begun in 
China starting from 1991. 
  At present, China has more than 7,000 large projects each 
with an investment of at least 10 million U.S. dollars. 
Included are about 4,000 set up last year. 
  These projects are mainly involved in the fields of real 
estate development, communications, telecommunications, basic 
industries and high-tech projects. 
  According to the meeting, the proportion of enterprises 
solely funded by foreign business people in the foreign-funded 
sector has risen remarkably since 1991. 
  By the end of last year, China had 20,047 registered 
enterprises solely funded by foreign business people, accounting 
for 24 percent of all foreign-funded enterprises registered on 
the Chinese mainland. 
  According to the meeting, foreign business people have 
widened their business scope over the past 14 years from hotels, 
electronics, building materials, machinery, textiles, light and 
textile industries, medicine and agriculture to energy 
development, transportation and telecommunications, basic 
industries, science and education, the arts, banking and 
insurance. 
  In the past three years, the volume of foreign investment in 
service industries has increased remarkably. 
  Most of the foreign-funded projects are productive 
industrial 
enterprises. 
  A survey shows that foreign-funded enterprises had an 
average 
investment of 2.28 million U.S. dollars each by the end of 1993, 
and 92 percent of the 167,000 enterprises had an investment of 
less than five million U.S. dollars each. 
  To better draw foreign investment, the Chinese Government 
has 
approved the establishment of 54 economic and technology 
development zones and 13 bonded parks. Recently it permitted 
Singapore to set up an eight-square-kilometer science and 
industry park in Suzhou, an economically-booming city in east 
China's Jiangsu Province. 
  While improving investment conditions, the Chinese 
Government 
has paid attention to the formulation of laws and regulations, 
thus enhancing the confidence of foreign business people in 
making investment in the country. 
  In addition, China's abundant labor and technical forces, 
the 
improved industrial foundation and the vast domestic market have 
drawn the interest of foreign business people.

  [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Beijing has attracted a 
steady flow of investment from major trans-national companies 
over the past few years, according to the municipal economic 
commission. 
  A commission official said that by the end of 1993 Beijing's 
manufacturing industry had launched 40 joint ventures with 
trans-national companies, each with an investment of at least 10 
million U.S. dollars. 
  The ventures involve 2.08 billion dollars in total 
investment, he added. 
  Joint ventures have been set up with the Matsushita Company 
of Japan, the Chrysler Company of the United States, the Philips 
Company of the Netherlands and the ABB Company of Switzerland. 
  These ventures are all being run at a profit, the official 
said. 
  For example, the Beijing Jeep Company, a joint venture 
between the Beijing Motor Vehicle Plant and the Chrysler 
Company, has generated four billion yuan in profits and tax 
payment since it started operation ten years ago. 
  The company, the first Sino-foreign joint venture in 
Beijing, 
has also increased the value of its fixed assets 10 times since 
1984. 
  The Matsushita Company has launched a number of joint 
ventures with manufacturers in Beijing, including the 
Beijing-Matsushita Color TV Tube Company, the Beijing-Matsushita 
Electrical Appliances Company, the Beijing-Matsushita 
Electronics Company and the Beijing- Matsushita Control Device 
Company. 
  In addition, the Siemens company of Germany, the Pepsi-Cola 
company of the United States and the ABB Company of Switzerland 
are expanding their investments in Beijing, the official said. 
  Gao Zuozhi, director of the commission, said that joint 
ventures with a turnover of one billion yuan in 1993 were all 
ventures between manufacturers attached to the commission and 
overseas businesses. 
  "This shows that there are bright prospects for 
trans-national companies investing in Beijing's manufacturing 
industry," he said. 
  "It alsO indicates that major state-owned enterprises in 
Beijing can enter into successful co-operation with 
trans-national companies," he added. 
  He said that in the future Beijing will give priority to the 
growth of 12 industries, including automobiles, electronics, 
meters and instruments, new chemicals, building materials and 
pharmaceuticals. 
  He pledged more efforts to expanding co-operation with 
trans-national companies in order to spur the growth of 
Beijing's industry as a whole.

<F P=106> ["Procedures for Appraising Foreign-Invested Property" </F>
issued on 18 March 1994 by the State Administration for Import 
and Export Inspection and the Ministry of Finance] 
  [Text] Chapter One -- General Rules 
  Article 1. These procedures were drafted according to 
Article 33 of the "PRC Rules for Implementation of Inspection 
Laws on Imports and Exports" (hereafter shortened as "import and 
export inspection rules"); Article 29 of the "PRC Rules for 
Implementation of Foreign-Capital Enterprises"; and the 
provisions of relevant laws and administrative rules and 
regulations for the purpose of properly appraising 
foreign-invested property, achieving the goal of attracting 
foreign capital, and safeguarding the legitimate rights and 
interests of all investing parties. 
  Article 2. These procedures apply to the appraisal of 
property of foreign-invested enterprises and various forms of 
foreign compensatory trade established within Chinese borders by 
foreign (including the Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan regions) 
companies, enterprises, and other forms of economic 
organizations or individuals (hereafter shortened as foreign 
businesses); of property put into their investments by foreign 
investors; and of property purchased from outside Chinese 
borders on behalf of foreign investing enterprises. 
  Article 3. The PRC State Administration for Import and 
Export Inspection (hereafter shortened as Inspection 
Administration) is charged with appraising property invested by 
foreign businesses across the country. The Import and Export 
Inspection Bureaus (hereafter shortened as local inspection 
bureaus) opened in various localities by the Inspection 
Administration are in charge of managing and handling the 
appraisal of invested property by foreign businesses within 
their jurisdictions. The Property Appraisal Agency and its 
Assets Assessment Office, the latter being financed and run 
jointly with foreign partners, (the two hereafter shortened as 
other appraisal agencies), established by local inspection 
bureaus in accordance with Article 8 of these procedures, are 
the two organs appraising foreign businesses' invested property. 
  Article 4. The PRC Ministry of Finance is responsible for 
managing and assessing nationwide the invested property of 
foreign businesses and related financial work. Local financial 
departments are responsible for assessing the invested property 
of foreign businesses and related financial work in their 
jurisdictions. Accounting firms certified by the Ministry of 
Finance and its departments in localities are responsible for 
handling the actual assessment of foreign businesses' invested 
property. 
  Article 5. The appraisal of foreign-invested property must 
observe the principles of authenticity, equity, scientificity, 
and feasibility, and is conducted according to methods and 
standards in line with international conventions and as laid 
down by the state. 
  Article 6. The appraisal of foreign-invested property 
includes appraisal of the types, quality, quantity, value, and 
damage of foreign-invested property, which targets type names, 
model numbers, quality, quantity, specifications, trademarks, 
degree of newness, date of production, manufacturing country, 
and name of makers. Value appraisal is aimed at determining the 
current value of foreign-invested property. Damage appraisal 
determines the causes, extent, and cost of damage and cleanup, 
and residual value of foreign-invested property damaged by 
natural disasters and accidents. 
  Article 7. Local inspection bureaus and other appraisal 
agencies handle the appraisal of foreign-invested property and 
provide an appraisal certificate as required by provisions. 
Value appraisal certificates issued by them are valid proof of 
the value of property contributed by investing parties. 
  Accounting firms must base their capital assessment work of 
foreign-invested property upon value appraisal certificates 
issued by local inspection bureaus and other appraisal agencies. 
<H5>  Chapter Two -- Organization Management </H5>
  Article 8. Property appraisal offices and assets assessment 
agencies set up by local inspection bureaus, the latter being 
jointly financed and run with foreign partners, must be 
scrutinized and approved by the Inspection Administration and 
the Ministry of Finance before conducting appraisals specified 
in these procedures; such scrutiny and approval must be conveyed 
to accounting firms and concerned departments. 
  Article 9. Foreign-invested property appraisers must go 
through special training provided by the Inspection 
Administration, pass examinations, and obtain a "qualification 
certificate" issued by the Inspection Administration before 
conducting appraisals of foreign- invested property. 
<H5>  Chapter Three -- Appraisal Methods and Procedures </H5>
  Article 10. The appraisal of foreign-invested property must 
be based on the actual condition, degree of newness, function 
indicators, technical parameters, replacement cost, and 
profitability of the property in question, and are done 
according to the appraisal methods and relevant provisions 
specified in these procedures. 

    Article 11. Methods for appraising foreign-invested property 
include the field survey, technical inspection, and value 
appraisal methods. The value appraisal method includes also the 
following methods: 
  1. Market method; 
  2. Cost method; 
  3. Revenue method; 
  4. Other methods approved by the Ministry of Finance and 
Inspection Administration. 
  Article 12. Appraisals of the value of foreign-invested 
property using the market method should take the current market 
value of identical or similar assets as reference. 
  Article 13. In appraising foreign-invested property using 
the cost method, first we must deduct the aggregate depreciation 
amount, itself obtained from the replacement cost, from the 
replacement cost of the property in brand-new condition, and 
take into account its production capacity variations, 
cost-conversion rate [cheng xin lu 2052 2450 3764], and other 
factors, before we can arrive at the revalorization of the 
property being appraised. Or we can determine anew its 
cost-conversion rate and thereby obtain its revalorization on 
the basis of its actual condition and its serviceable life 
length, again taking into consideration changes in functions. 
  Article 14. In appraising foreign-invested property using 
the revenue method, we should arrive at the current value of 
property being appraised on the basis of projected profitability 
of the property and a reasonable discount rate. 
  Article 15. The appraisal of foreign-invested property 
should be conducted in the following way: 
  1. Applicant applies for an appraisal; 
  2. Initial scrutiny by an appraisal agency; application 
accepted; 
  3. Appraisers draw up an appraisal plan; 
  4. Verification of bills and documentation provided by 
the applicant; investigation of domestic and foreign markets; 
  5. Field surveys; 
  6. Selection of a suitable appraisal method for the 
appraisal; 
  7. Issuance of appraisal certificate. 
  Article 16. In applying for a foreign-invested property 
appraisal, applicants should fill out an application form, 
listing in it the reason, object, and requirements for appraisal 
and providing a property index, customs declarations, contracts, 
invoices, insurance policies, maintenance fees and bills, and 
documents on equipment and technology. 
  Article 17. When accepting an application for 
foreign-invested property appraisal, local inspection bureaus 
and other appraisal agencies must check to ascertain that the 
applicant has submitted complete application forms and related 
information, and, in case the status quo of the property in 
question needs to be preserved, demand that property be sealed 
and placed in custody. 
  Article 18. Appraisers should appraise according to 
provisions. When doing field surveys and appraisals, they must 
verify each of the items appraised. When necessary, they can 
demand additional information from persons concerned with the 
property. They should issue an appraisal certificate in a 
timely fashion when the appraisal is finished. 
  Article 19. If the applicant dissents from the appraisal 
result, he can apply for a re-appraisal to the local inspection 
bureau which made the appraisal, or to any which is higher in 
level than the original inspection bureau; he can go as high as 
the Inspection Administration. Specific steps for the 
re-appraisal application follow the provisions in the 
"procedures for re-appraising imports and exports." 
<H5>  Chapter Four -- Legal Responsibility </H5>

notice of punishment. If the accused objects to the result of 
the review, he can file a lawsuit with a people's court within 
30 days after he has received the review result. 
  The concerned local inspection bureau or financial 
department

<F P=106> [Article by Liu Rixin (0491 2480 2450) of the Economics </F>
Research Center of the State Planning Commission: "Views on 
Scale of Investment in Fixed Assets"] 
  [Text] During the 
period in which our country is shifting toward the socialist 
market economy structure, theoretical circles and comrades in 
the departments in charge of macro-economic management actually 
hold different views on the matter of the present scale of 
investment in fixed assets. To summarize, their controversy 
focuses on two questions: First, is the present scale of 
investment in fixed assets too big or not? Second, how should 
the state control the scale of investment under present specific 
conditions? The following are my own viewpoints on these two 
questions. 
  The question of whether or not the present scale of 
investment in fixed assets is too big involves the means and 
standard for measuring the scale of investment. 
  One way is to use comparable prices to compare the 
investment 
scale of one year with that of the previous year; that is, we 
can get the investment scale and its growth rate after allowing 
for price rises in the scale of investment of the year. We can 
accordingly judge if the investment scale is proper. Some 
economists favor this method, and the State Statistics Bureau 
has also compiled price indexes of investment in fixed assets. 
The statistical communique of 1993 indicated the society-wide 
investment in fixed assets was 1,182.9 billion yuan. Although 
it increased by 50.6 percent over the previous year, it actually 
increased by 22 percent over the previous year with the 
deduction of the price index of investment in fixed assets 
(which stood at 23.4 percent). The growth rate was lower than 
that of 1992, which stood at 23.7 percent. So it is impossible 
to come to the conclusion that the scale of investment for the 
year is too high. Nor did the statistical communique of 1993 
mention that the investment scale of the year was too high. 
Instead, it only said that "the total scale of investment in 
fixed assests of construction projects in progress was too 
high." However, scale of investment and scale of construction 
projects in progress are two different concepts. The communique 
of 1993 indicated that the total scale of investment in fixed 
assets of construction projects in progress for state-owned 
units was 2,327.1 billion yuan. With the deduction of projects 
that were completed by the end of the year, the volume of 
unfinished projects amounted to 1,320 billion yuan; given that 
the amount of investment of the state-owned units completed in 
fixed assets stood at 832.1 billion yuan for the year, the 
unfinished projects could be completed within one year and seven 
months. It was major progress as compared with the fact that 
the construction projects in progress needed two or three or 
more years to be completed in recent years. So we cannot say 
that the scale of construction projects in progress at the end 
of 1993 was too big either. 
  Another way is to get the proportion of investment in fixed 
assets in the GDP by comparing the investment scale of the year 
with the GDP based on current prices. When we view investment 
in connection with the economic strength of the state, we can 
see if the investment scale is in proportion to the state 
economic strength. 
  According to the statistic data, the proportions of the last 
three years are listed in the following table:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  In 1993, the society-wide fixed assets investment accounted 
for 37.7 percent of the GDP, while investment of the state-owned 
units in fixed assets accounted for 26.5 percent of the GDP. In 
my opinion, this indicates that the investment scale was too 
big. The reasons are as follows: 
  First, in view of the historical experience of 
investment rates in fixed assets, the current scale of 
investment has broken through the rational limit. The 
practice of reform and opening to the world for fifteen years 
indicates that once the proportion of society-wide investment in 
fixed assets in the GDP exceeds 30 percent, and the proportion 
of investment of state-owned units in fixed assets in the GDP 
exceeds 20 percent, the relations in various aspects of the 
national economy will become strained and even out of 
proportion. The present relations of all aspects of the 
national economy has already been very strained. The reason is 
no other than this. 
  Second, compared with the planned arrangement for 1993, 
the original scale of investment was much exceeded. The 
first plenary session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
adopted the plan for 1993. It arranged that the total scale of 
society-wide investment in fixed assets to be 800 billion yuan, 
the investment rate being controlled within 30 percent. 
Investment in state-owned units took up 565 billion yuan of it 
while that of collective-owned units and invididuals accounted 
for 235 billion. Now the society- wide investment in fixed 
assets has exceeded the planned amount by 382.9 billion yuan, 
the excess rate being 47.9 percent. Investment in state-owned 
units is 267.1 billion more than the planned amount, the excess 
rate being 47.3 percent, while investment by collective- owned 
units and individuals has exceeded the planned amount by 115.8 
billion yuan, the excess rate being 49.3%. According to 
the 
1993 plan, the arranged investment rate was controlled within 30 
percent, that is, the proportion of the society-wide investment 
in fixed assets in the national income. According to 
statistics, the rate of society-wide investment in fixed assets 
in 1992 was 39.5%. It is estimated that it rose to around 
42 
percent in 1993, exceeding that in the period of "the Great Leap 
Forward." This was unusual since the founding of the PRC. 
  Third, last year's currency supply hit a record 
high, reflecting an excessive scale in investment. In 
1993, the GDP rose by 30.6 percent according to current price 
calculation, while the society-wide investment in fixed assets 
rose by 50.6 percent. That is an important reason why the demand 
for currency grew. The situation of rapid increase in 
investment causing an abrupt increase in currency supply is as 
follows: On the basis of a large supply of 115.8 billion in 
1992, a record high supply of 152.9 billion yuan was made in 
1993. It was more than the total supply of the latter five 
years in the 1980s (a total supply of 115.3 billion yuan from 
1985 to 1989). By the end of 1993, currency in circulation 
reached 586.5 billion. It rose by 35.3 percent compared to an 
increase of 36.5 percent in the previous year. This was 
exceeded only in 1988 (an increase of 46.7 percent), reaching 
another height. 
  Fourth, the state of inflation also reflects an 
excessive scale of investment. The increase of currency 
supply caused by inflationary investment resulted in price 
hikes. In 1993, the price index of the residents living cost 
expenses (including commodity and service prices, i.e., the 
consumer price index in the West) rose by 14.7 percent compared 
to an increase of 6.4 percent in 1992, while the retail price 
index rose by 13 percent compared to an increase of 5.4 percent 
in 1992. The inflation rate last year exceeded two digits, for 
the fourth time in over four decades after the founding of the 
PRC. Great attention should be paid to it. As the effect of 
money supply on prices has a lag period, the big increase of 
money supply in 1993 will play a role in commodity price hikes 
in 1994. So this year our economy will continue to face a severe 
inflation situation. 
  Fifth, compared with foreign countries, the investment 
scale of our country is relatively large. At present, the 
proportion of investment in fixed assets in the GDP usually 
stands around 15 to 20 percent in developed countries. Japan 
stood around 30 percent at the highest. Of course, this 
proportion has to do with the stage of economic development. 
Take the ROK, a newly emerging industrialized country, for 
example. When its economy took off in the 1970s, the highest 
proportion was only around 33 percent. At that time, that of 
Taiwan was only around 28 percent (22.8 percent in 1992). 
  How the country should control the scale of investment is a 
problem that has not been settled properly under the new 
situation in which macro-economic regulation and control is 
being implemented. 
  One opinion holds it unnecessary for the state to control 
the 
investment scale and that it cannot be controlled either. 
However, I think it is necessary to control it. I can only put 
forward some opinion about principles as I have not studied a 
lot about concrete steps. 
<H5>  First, It Should Be Made Clear that the State Maintains the </H5>
Principle of Guiding the Scale of Investment Through Planning 
Under the System of Market Economy 
  Drawing on the experience of the market economy practiced by 
Western countries (regions), in its plan the state can set an 
absolute investment amount (including investment in fixed assets 
and the amount of additional circulating funds) as well as the 
total investment rate, i.e. the proportion of the total 
investment (separating fixed assets investment and the amount of 
additional circulating funds) in the GNP. In this way, the 
investment scale will be more or less in keeping with the 
economic strength of the country. With the reform of planning, 
it is required that statistics move a step ahead to work out the 
relevant indexes of the base period. 
<H5>  Second, the State Should Formulate a Comparatively Detailed </H5>
Industrial Policy To Guide Investment Direction 
  An industrial policy should be implemented in various 
localities. We should combine readjustment of economic levers 
with implementation of an industrial policy to promote 
realization of the state investment plan. 
<H5>  Third, the Central Bank Should Strengthen Its Control Over </H5>
Fixed Asset Loans 
  The central bank should strictly control the plan for fixed 
asset loans transmitted by the state. It should be included in 
both the state investment plan and the credit plan of the bank. 
It should be strictly carried out with no excess allowed. 
Financial institutions of all kinds should not give fixed 
assets loans at random. Localities and departments cannot issue 
bonds, launch pilot projects of adopting the share-holding 
system, and illegally raise funds for construction. We should 
work according to the state plan while exploiting foreign 
capital. We should strengthen guidance and practice of 
standardized management in those construction projects in which 
foreign businessmen have invested directly. 
<H5>  Fourth, Use Different Means to Control Investments for </H5>
Different Investors 
  The present macro-management of investment actually still 
focuses on the management of investments by state-owned units, 
failing to see investors of various economic elements newly 
emerged since reform and opening up started, such as those of 
the private economy, individual economy, township and town 
enterprises, Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign 
cooperation enterprises, enterprises solely run by foreign 
businessmen, and enterprises run jointly by the state and 
collectives, by the state and individuals, and by collectives 
and individuals. The main efforts of our reform of the economic 
management structure should be shifted to these practical 
affairs to earnestly strengthen macro-management of investment.

<F P=106> [By Tian Ying: "Inspectors Seek Overseas Ties"] </F>
  [Text] Trade inspectors hope to increase ties with foreign 
counterparts, officials said yesterday at a national conference 
in Beijing. 
  As a first step, more inspection joint ventures will be set 
up nationwide this year, said Tian Runzhi, newly-appointed 
director of the State Administration of Import and Export 
Commodities Inspection. 
  This will provide valuable experience and teach management 
methods to Chinese inspectors, he said. 
  The administration also plans to invite foreign experts to 
open courses and send Chinese abroad for training. 
  In addition, more laboratories are to work closer with 
Chinese commodity inspection officials to check imported goods. 
<H5>  Plans </H5>
  Plans also include signing an agreement with Israel and 
Russia and a letter-of-intent with UL [Underwriters' 
Laboratory], the top inspection body in the United States. 
  Contacts will also be strengthened with Singapore, the 
Republic of Korea, Australia, Japan, Britain, Italy and the 
European Community. 
  Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan are also seeking to strengthen 
links with the mainland. 
  Tian said at the conference that Chinese inspection 
organizations must continue to reform their operations. 
  One step will turn several modern labs and research 
institutes into independent facilities to check goods and the 
property of foreign-funded enterprises. 
  New inspection sites will also be built in cities and ports 
where foreign trade has soared, Tian said. 
  Inspectors will particularly focus on high-volume export 
commodities that cover safety, hygiene and environmental 
protection. 
  And both central and local administrations will continue to 
issue licences and hygiene certificates. 
  According to the Measures for Management of Foreign 
Investment and Property Evaluation that went into effect on May 
1, officials are required to make objective and accurate 
appraisals. 
  According to Tian, Chinese inspection bureaus last year 
inspected 1.37 million import and export shipments valued at 
$75.2 billion. About 24,000 were found to be subpar, about half 
of which were for export. 
  The bureau said raw oil, steel, iron, digital watches, 
computers and cameras exported by Chinese companies passed 
inspection. 
  Among imports, all toys, washing-machines, edible oil and 
vacuum cleaners passed quality checks.

<F P=106> [By reporters Hsu Yun-teng (1776 0061 7506) and Chang Cheng </F>
(1728 2973): "Zhou Zhengqing Says Hong Kong Currency and Other 
Foreign Currencies Will Gradually Be Banned From Circulation on 
the Mainland"] 
  [Text] In a special interview with these staff reporters 
today, Zhou Zhengqing, executive vice governor of Mainland 
China's People's Bank of China, said: The New Taiwan dollar, 
the Hong Kong dollar, and other foreign currencies will 
gradually be banned from circulation and use or as fiduciary 
units on the mainland. These currencies must not be used on the 
mainland, unless they have been changed into renminbi at 
designated exchange points. 
  As for when foreign businesses and foreign banks can begin 
the renminbi business, Zhou Zhengqing said: "It is not time 
yet. I think it is impossible even by the end of this year. 
This policy will not be pursued until the tax rates for 
mainland banks and foreign banks are the same." 
  In light of the mainland's current economic situation and 
inflationary pressures, he stressed: There is no such thing as 
an overheated economy in mainland China, although a few real 
estate markets are overheated because of speculation. However, 
it is now completely under control. In particular, the new 
anti-inflation measures introduced recently have worked more 
effectively. 
  Wang Xuebing, president of the Bank of China, also told 
these 
reporters: The Hong Kong dollar will gradually be banned from 
use and circulation in the Zhujiang Delta. Travelers from 
outside China must change their Hong Kong dollars into renminbi 
for use, that is to say, the Hong Kong dollar will be allowed to 
be changed at exchange points in stores on a basis of "immediate 
exchange and immediate use." 
  Wang Xuebing said that the number of these money exchange 
points will gradually be increased to meet the needs of 
travelers from outside the borders to reduce the inconvenience 
brought about by the ban of the circulation of the Hong Kong 
dollar.

  [Text] Beijing, May 4 (CNS) -- Inflation in China has now 
reached the limit of urban residents' tolerance with market 
prices tending to continue upwards, a market researcher with the 
Ministry of Internal Trade, Mr. Xu Rongchang, said. He added 
that the authorities should strengthen control on prices. 
  Mr. Xu Rongchang said that the marcoeconomic situation was 
generally sound during the first quarter of this year but the 
prices growth continued to climb based on a rather high figure 
of last year. National retail prices rose by 20.1 percent 
during the first quarter over the same period last year, a gain 
exceeding the prices growth registered in 1988. 
  Mr. Xu said he was convinced that inflation had just about 
reached the limits of endurance for a large number of residents. 
In rural areas, gains in income earned by peasants was lower 
than that by urban workers for the sixth consecutive year. The 
endurance of peasants has become so fragile when taking into 
consideration a total of 85 million people who have not yet 
solved their food and clothing problems, in addition to peasants 
in disaster areas. In urban areas, with the problems of 
inflation and unfair distribution prevailing, an increasing 
number of workers have seen their income cut and they have 
tended to have a strong response to the price hikes. 
  The researcher called for an immediate strengthening of 
macroeconomic regulation to prevent economic overheating. He 
also appealed for the making use of a prime chance to push 
forward price reform. The food package project should be 
properly carried out while at the same time prices should be put 
under control in order to keep prices growth at the set target 
of not more than 10 percent.

  [Text] Beijing, may 5 (XINHUA) -- China has seen marked 
improvement in the quality of its import and export commodities 
in the first three months of this year, with the disqualified 
rate dropping to 2.16 percent. 
  The figure was much lower than that in the corresponding 
period of last year, said Tian Runzhi, the newly-appointed head 
of the state administration for the inspection of import and 
export commodities. 
  According to Tian, the inspection departments nationwide 
examined in total 373,000 groups of import and export 
commodities in the first quarter of the year, which were valued 
at 21.2 billion yuan. 
  Judging from the main export commodities, the quality of 
machinery products was the best, with a disqualified quality 
rate of 0.29 percent. Then came light industrial products with 
the disqualified rate standing at 0.45 percent. 
  The disqualified rate for chemical products remained the 
highest, to the tune of 1.59 percent, which however was also 
lower than the figure recorded for the same period last year, 
according to the official. 
  Significantly, some 20 items of main export commodities 
showed zero disqualified rates, including crude oil, rolled 
steel and iron products, electronic watches, electronic 
computers and cameras. 
  Of the import commodities, according to Tian, the 
disqualified rates of textiles, light industrial and machinery 
products dropped respectively to 3.8 percent, 2.74 percent and 
2.51 percent, much lower than the figures recorded for the same 
period last year. 
  The imported commodities of jute, toys, household washing 
machines, edible vegetable oil and vacuum cleaners showed zero 
disqualified rates.

  [Text] Wuhan, May 6 (XINHUA) -- The Wuhan Iron and Steel 
Company, one of China's leading producers of steel, has been 
making active efforts to improve its efficiency since late 1992. 
  The company, which was founded in the 1950s, now has key 
production plants such as a blast furnace, a steel plant and a 
rolling mill, and auxiliary plants for making machinery, and 
providing electricity and water. It also has a construction 
team, as well as a hospital, schools and a food-processing 
factory. 
  The production efficiency of the company has long been 
hindered to some degree by this complicated network of 
installations, and the per capita output of steel of the workers 
in the company is around 40 tons a year, equal to only one fifth 
of that of the Baoshan Iron and Steel Company based in Shanghai. 
  Beginning in August 1992, the company has attached great 
importance to the improvement of its efficiency and worked out 
concrete measures to achieve this goal. 
  The measures include reducing surplus labor from the 
production line and diverting it to other work, and separating 
steel production from other departments. 
  Now, the company's team engaged in the production of iron 
and 
steel has been reduced from the former 120,000 to the present 
50,000. 
  The endeavor has begun to pay off. Last year, the company 
produced 5.234 million tons of steel, an increase of 5.35 
percent compared with the previous year, and the per capita 
production of steel of the company rose to 100 tons. It also 
produced 5.4 million tons of pig iron last year, up 6.6 percent 
compared with the corresponding figure for 1992, according to 
company officials. 
  In the first four months of this year the company turned out 
1.7 million tons of steel and 1.8 million tons of pig iron, both 
showing sharp increases compared with the related figures for 
the same period of last year.

  [Text] The Ministry of Radio, Film and Television of China 
has signed an agreement with Asia Satellite Telecommunications 
Co (AsiaSat) to buy two Ku-band transponders on AsiaSat-2 
satellite. 
  With the latest purchase the ministry is committed to buy 
three Ku-band transponders on the satellite. 
  The ministry also signed two five-year lease agreements with 
AsiaSat for the renewal of two C-band transponders on AsiaSat-1 
satellite. 
  Peter Jackson, chief executive of AsiaSat, said: "AsiaSat 
has established a wide customer base in China, and we believe 
the reason is our reputation for quality in the marketplace. 
  "We are proud of our association with China and that we are 
able to provide our services to its people. Our cooperation 
will be further strengthened with this commitment from the 
Ministry of Radio, Film and Television." 
  AsiaSat-2 is set for launch in the first quarter of next 
year. It has 24 C-band transponders and nine Ku-band 
transponders. 
  C-band transponders' coverage stretches from Turkey to Japan 
and from the Commonwealth of Independent States to Australia and 
New Zealand. Ku-band transponders cover mainly China and its 
neighbouring countries. 
  China now leases 6-1/2 transponders on AsiaSat-1 to 16 
customers. 
  AsiaSat's applications in China range from television 
broadcasting to public and private networks, used by 
high-profile industry leaders and ministries. 
  The PEOPLE'S DAILY newspaper is using AsiaSat 1 for its 
distribution in China, the People's Bank of China for its 
national clearance system and Civil Aviation Administration of 
China for air ticket reservations network.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- The State Council today 
submitted two proposals to the Seventh Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, requesting 
it to examine the draft PRC Law Governing the Management of 
Urban Real Estate, and the draft supplementary regulations to 
the PRC Regulations for Controlling and Punishing Public 
Offenses. 
  In the proposal requesting the session to examine the draft 
law governing the management of urban real estate, Premier Li 
Peng said the objectives of this law are to improve the 
management of urban real estate, maintain the real estate 
market's order, protect the legitimate rights and interests of 
real estate owners, and bring about a healthy development in the 
real estate business. 
  In the motion requesting the session to examine the 
supplementary regulations to the PRC Regulations for Controlling 
and Punishing Public Offenses, Li Peng says that, since their 
promulgation on 1 January 1987, the regulations have played an 
important role in maintaining public order and safeguarding 
social stability. However, because of the changes in public 
order and the appearance of certain new situations and problems, 
the regulations should be supplemented. 
  Premier Li Peng added that the State Council's executive 
meetings have discussed and adopted the two drafts. 
  At this morning's session, Vice Construction Minister Ye 
Rutang and Public Security Minister Tao Siju respectively 
explained these two drafts at the State Council's request. 
  Ye Rutang said: The real estate business is a basic business 
preceding economic development, and it is one of the national 
economy's pillar industries. The real estate business' 
development not only provides the basic material foundation and 
precondition for economic development, but also can help improve 
city dwellers' living conditions and create an important avenue 
of financial resources for the state. Because of the important 
role the real estate business plays in the national economic and 
social development, it is objectively essential to regulate, 
guide, promote, and protect it by law. 
  He said: China's real estate business has been developing 
rapidly since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, and especially since the systems governing the 
compensatory use of state-owned urban land and the comprehensive 
development and construction of real estate. In 1992 after 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave his important talks during his 
inspection in southern China and after the 14th CPC Congress was 
convened, both reform and construction have expedited, and 
development of the real estate business entered a new stage. 
Meanwhile, following the rapid development of the real estate 
business, certain problems badly needing a solution have 
appeared. The main problems are: loss of control in the total 
supply of construction land and loss of the state's land 
resources as a result of the craze in leasing land and building 
development zones; irrational investment in real estate 
development and excessive establishment of real estate 
developing businesses; and unregulated trade, chaotic prices, 
serious land and real estate speculation, and loss of incomes 
from state-owned land as result of defective mechanisms 
governing the real estate market. Fundamental solutions to 
these problems lie in codifying real estate management. 
  On the guidelines for drawing up the law governing urban 
real estate management, Ye Rutang said: 1) In accordance with 
the decision made by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, the law should provide that the state will 
monopolize the primary market of urban land so as to prevent the 
loss of land resources; and that mechanisms ensuring a normal 
real estate market should be established so that real estate 
development and trade can be managed more efficiently. 2) 
Attention should be paid to establishing a basic system for 
managing real estate, to coordinating the relationship between 
this law and other relevant laws and administrative regulations, 
and to reflecting the principle that the subjects [zhu ti 0031 
7555] having the right to use state-owned land in cities and the 
right to own the houses on the land should be the same [yi zhi 
0001 5268]. 3) The law's scientific attributes and its 
practicality should be integrated. On the basis of reviewing 
the experiences and lessons gained and learned from recent 
years' real estate development, we have codified the experiences 
of success and measures that can be put into practice with some 
efforts; deferred writing into the law those measures which are 
unlikely to be carried out today and in the time to come; and 
stipulated in principle those measures which conform to the 
policy for reform and development, but which cannot be carried 
out now owing to a lack of experience. In such a way we will 
have room for change and these principles can be reinforced and 
improved when conditions are ripe. 
  Ye Rutang also elaborated on what and where the law will 
make 
adjustments, land for real estate development, real estate 
development businesses, regulation in the real estate market, 
and real estate registration and licensing. 
  Tao Siju said in his explanation that the Regulations for 
Controlling and Punishing Public Offenses have played an 
important role in maintaining social security and order and 
safeguarding social stability since they became effective. 
However, he said, owing to changes in public security and the 
appearance of certain new situations and problems, certain acts 
that disturb social order, jeopardize public safety, and are 
detrimental to public interests cannot be handled because the 
regulations have no provisions for handling these acts. He 
said: The draft supplementary regulations have prescribed 18 
additional punishable public offenses. The types of these 
offenses and the principles for punishing them are the same as 
those in the original regulations. Punishing these offenses 
which exist in real life and which jeopardize social security 
are absolutely essential for intensifying control of public 
order; for safeguarding social order, public safety, and public 
interests; for protecting citizens' legitimate rights and 
interests; and for safeguarding the progress of reform, opening 
up, and socialist modernization.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- China regards serious 
copyright infringement as a felony subject to criminal 
punishment. The National People's Congress [NPC] Standing 
Committee Legislative Affairs Committee today submitted its 
draft decision on punishing copyright infringements to the 
Seventh Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee for 
examination. 
  At the request of the meeting of the NPC Standing Committee 
chairman and vice chairmen, Gu Angran, chairman of the NPC 
Standing Committee Legislative Affairs Committee, explained the 
draft decision at the session today. 
  Gu Angran said: Ever since the Copyright Law was drawn up in 
1990, it has played an important role in protecting authors' 
copyrights and their copyright-related interests, in promoting 
the development of socialist culture and science, and in 
promoting socialist ethics and material progress. However, 
certain lawless elements, in order to reap huge profits, have 
acted rampantly in pirating books, audio and videocassette 
tapes, and computer software. Their piracy not only has 
seriously infringed on the rights and interests of the authors 
and copyright holders but also has upset the normal order of the 
market of socialist culture and economic activities and has 
disturbed the development of the nation's economic relations and 
trade, as well as cultural and scientific exchange and 
cooperation with other countries. Such serious copyright 
infringements must be punished as a crime. GATT also demands 
that domestic laws must have provisions for punishing 
infringements of intellectual property rights. 
  Gu Angran said: Under this draft law, the following serious 
copyright infringements are considered as crimes: First, they 
fall under any one of the following copyright infringements for 
purposes of making profits, and the amounts of unlawful income 
are quite substantial, or the case is serious in some other 
respects: 1) reproducing the copyright holders' works without 
their permission; 2) publishing others' copyrighted books; and 
3) reproducing audio and video products without their producers' 
permission. Second, marketing apparently pirated products 
mentioned above for purposes of making profits, and the amounts 
of unlawful incomes are quite substantial. This includes 
exporting or importing and marketing apparently pirated products 
mentioned above, and the amounts of unlawful incomes are quite 
substantial. 
  As for penalties for copyright infringements, Gu Angran 
said: 
Because copyright infringements are primarily for unlawful 
economic interests, the infringers, in addition to being 
deprived of their personal freedom, must also be harshly 
penalized economically. Based on Chinese law's penalty for the 
infringement of industrial property rights as well as foreign 
countries' criminal sanctions against copyright infringements, 
the draft decision provides that infringers shall be sentenced 
to prison for up to five years, criminal detention, and/or fines 
according to the amounts of their unlawful incomes or the 
seriousness of their cases. The draft decision also provides 
that all the pirated products, unlawful incomes, materials, 
tools, equipment, and other assets used by units or individuals 
for copyright infringements shall be confiscated. If a unit has 
been found guilty, the unit shall be fined and its 
administrators and other personnel directly responsible for the 
crime shall be punished according to the aforementioned 
regulations.

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese copyright 
violators will henceforth be faced with imprisonment of up to 
five years, detention, and/or fines. 
  This has been provided in a draft decision on punishing 
criminals who violate copyrights submitted to the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's 
legislature, for deliberation today. 
  The draft decision also designated that all reproductions 
that violate copyrights, illegal income from them, and 
materials, tools, facilities and other property used for this 
purpose will be confiscated no matter whether they belong to an 
individual person or a work unit. 
  Director of the Legislative Affairs Work Committee of the 
NPC 
Standing Committee Gu Angran explained to the legislators that 
piracy of books, audio and video tapes, and computer software 
has become quite rampant in recent years, in illegal attempts to 
reap huge profits. 
  "This has infringed upon the rights of the authors and 
destroyed the normal order of the socialist cultural market and 
economic activities," said the director. 
  "It has also affected foreign trade of the country and its 
cultural and scientific exchanges and cooperation with foreign 
countries," he said, adding that perpetrators of this kind of 
activity should be severely punished. 
  The legal expert stressed that the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) also demands judicial punishment in 
domestic laws for such crimes violating intellectual property 
rights. 
  The draft decision also provides that those who sell illegal 
reproductions with clear knowledge of their origin and have 
illegally reaped large sums of money will be punished with two 
years' imprisonment, detention and/or fines; if their illegal 
profits are especially big, they will be punished with two to 
five years' imprisonment, together with fines.

<F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Gong Yongquan (7895 3057 </F>
3123) and XINHUA reporters Yuan Yanghe (5913 7402 0735) and Zhou 
Zhenfeng (0719 2182 0023): "A New Song of Yitao"] 
  [Excerpts] Nanjing, 4 May (XINHUA) -- XINHUA editor's 
note: Yitao Township, Jiangsu's "number one poor township," has 
greatly improved its situation in two years. The peasants there 
have written a "New Song of Yitao" and sing it everywhere. "New 
Song of Yitao," praising the blood-and-flesh ties between our 
party and the people, is both thought-provoking and inspiring. 
  The rural primary party organizations are the party's 
important foundation for accomplishing its rural work. The 
great changes of Yitao Township have shown to people that the 
party's rural principles and policies are in line with the 
people's aspirations. So long as there is a leader who is 
ideologically correct, displays a good work style, and has the 
courage to pioneer, the enthusiasm of the masses will be 
aroused, their strength will be pooled, and a poor village can 
quickly improve its situation. (end of editor's note) [passage 
omitted] 
  Yitao is an old revolutionary base area on the lower reaches 
of the Yishu He and it is named after Zhu Yitao who was a native 
here and a revolutionary martyr. After liberation, the cadres 
and people here made great efforts to develop production and 
Yitao was once very famous in the Chang Jiang and Huai He 
region. However, some cadres here changed their work style 
several years ago. They indulged in eating and drinking 
extravagantly and squandering pbulic funds. They also wantonly 
collected fees and fines and wantonly apportioned expenses and 
work among the people. There was a strong resentment among the 
people. During a visit here two years ago, the reporters heard 
the villagers sing a song: "Yitao peasants oppose 'three wanton 
practices'" [passage omitted] 
  The lyrics of the song was written by Sun Zhonghua, a 
villager of Wandui Village of Yitao Township. [passage omitted] 
  The reporters visited all villages in the township and saw 
that many villagers were living in shabby thatched huts and some 
of them did not even have food in their home. So, the reporters 
truthfully reported to the departments concerned Yitao's serious 
problem, the peasants' plight, and their song. 
  After General Secretary Jiang Zemin heard about the song, he 
issued an important instruction on improving the situation of 
Yitao. The Jiangsu Provincial CPC Committee was determined to 
solve problem for the "number one poor township." [passage 
omitted] 
  In 1992 spring, the Shuyang County CPC Committee appointed 
Chen Xueping, a young cadre, to serve as the secretary of the 
Yitao Township Party Committee. Chen Xueping is a 
"trouble-shooter." [passage omitted] 
  The township party committee deems it an important task to 
reduce the peasants' burden. In 1993, the peasants' burden was 
reduced by 710,000 yuan. [passage omitted] 
  The party committee also helped raise funds, successfully 
built 10 electric pumping stations and 500 auxiliary projects, 
and turned 35,000 mu of dry land into rice paddies which ensure 
stable yields despite droughts or excessive rains. [passage 
omitted] 
  In 1993, Yitao Township, with industrial and agricultural 
output value exceeding 120 million yuan, became the first 
township of the "100-million-yuan category" in the county.

  [Text] Beijing, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said here 
today that Chinese youngsters should adhere to the basic line of 
the Communist Party of China (CPC) and shoulder the historic 
responsibilities of promoting the country's development. 
  Today is China's "May 4th" Youth Day. It is also the 75th 
anniversary of China's "May 4th Movement" of 1919, an 
anti-imperialist, anti-feudal political and cultural movement 
led by intellectuals imbued with the rudiments of communist 
ideology. 
  Qiao Shi, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of 
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, presented a 
"Chinese youth volunteers" flag to eight young volunteer service 
teams at the Great Hall of the People this morning. 
  At the flag presentation ceremony, Qiao said that China now 
is in a critical period of historical development. The 
realization of the great goal of the country's development 
depends on youngsters' hard work, he said. 
  He expressed the hope that organizations of the Chinese 
Communist Youth League (CCYL) will further develop youngsters' 
voluntary service activities and make more contributions to 
China's socialist construction. 
  He also urged Chinese young people to carry forward the 
spirit of patriotism and collectivism and train themselves to be 
qualified personnel for the next century. 
  The young volunteer activities were sponsored by the CCYL 
Central Committee last December. The eight volunteer service 
teams will go to poor areas in the country to help develop local 
economies, eliminate illiteracy and provide health services. 
  Vice-Premier Li Lanqing also conferred "youth civilization 
models" plaques on six exemplary youth groups from China's 
public transportation departments here today. 
  Some 10,000 Beijing young people took the CCYL oath on 
joining the organization at Tiananmen Square today. More than 
one million new Youth League members also took the oath in other 
parts of the country.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- After being briefed on 
the preparations of the fourth Chinese art festival, Li Tieying, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and state 
councillor, pointed out recently that the art festival must be 
brilliant but economical, and that it must have special 
characteristics. He said the spirit of reform should be 
displayed in finding a way to make the festival a success, to 
promote culture and art, and to expedite economic development 
and social progress in all fields. 
  Chairing a meeting held on 21 March to study and coordinate 
preparations for the fourth Chinese art festival, Li Tieying was 
briefed by the Ministry of Culture and the Gansu Provincial 
People's Government on the preparations for the festival. Li 
Tieying said: Each and every art festival must have its special 
characteristics, otherwise it will be dull. While we have 
national sports meets, we also should have art festivals. Both 
are important, and the two are similar in terms of sizes and the 
ways they are held. While proceeding with economic 
modernization, we must also expedite cultural and art 
development. We must attach importance to achieving a unity 
between artistic effects and economic results, making sure that 
the festival will help local economic development. While there 
should be performances staged by professional artists, there 
should also be cultural and art activities of the masses, as 
well as popular shows, so that the involvement of the masses 
will inspire them and boost their morale. While emphasizing 
Chinese culture, the festival should also pay attention to 
promoting international exchange so that the festival will 
become an arena for promoting friendship and contacts between 
China and the rest of the world, and so that the festival will 
reflect its objectives of promoting prosperity, solidarity, and 
progress. 
  Li Tieying stressed: We should sum up our previous 
experiences in holding festivals and sports meets, such as the 
good experiences which Guangxi and Yunnan have respectively 
gained in holding the sports meet of minority people and the 
third Chinese art festival. We can also follow the experiences 
of foreign countries. Anything we do today needs money, but we 
cannot count on the state to take care of everything. Thrift is 
one principle we must follow in carrying any public projects. 
We cannot afford not to economize when holding nationwide 
projects. We cannot go on to launch these projects if they have 
become increasingly expensive. We must encourage people to work 
as volunteers. Only when more people are involved will there be 
greater social results. Li Tieying hoped the art festival will 
be held more successfully on the basis of summing up previous 
experiences. 
  Li Tieying urged relevant departments of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council to work with greater 
coordination, support all festival projects, and help solve 
problems so that the art festival not only will be a success 
itself, but will also expedite reforms and development in Gansu 
and northwest China. 
  The fourth Chinese art festival, which is scheduled to take 
place in Lanzhou, capital of Gansu, from 18 to 28 August 1994, 
will be sponsored by the Ministry of Culture with support from 
the Gansu Provincial People's Government and the Foundation for 
Chinese Art Festival. The theme of the forthcoming art festival 
is: Solidarity, Reform, Prosperity; Bringing Together the Best 
of Art, and Fostering the National Culture. The general 
guideline for the art festival and its specific projects have 
been basically determined, and all preparations have started. 
  Chen Changben, vice minister of culture; Sun Ying, deputy 
secretary of the Gansu Provinciall Party Committee; and Chen 
Yiling, vice governor of Gansu, briefed Li Tieying on the 
preparations for the fourth Chinese art festival. Comrades in 
charge of relevant departments under central and state organs 
were present at the meeting. 
  The meeting also studed the problems encountered during the 
preparations and came up with some solutions.

<F P=106> [By HEBEI RIBAO reporter Kang Enhua (1660 1869 5478) and </F>
XINHUA reporter (0719 0679 0112)] 
  [Text] Shijiazhuang, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- During his recent 
trip to rural Hebei to inspect spring plowing and production, 
Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and member of the CPC Central Committee 
Secretariat, stated: Spring plowing and production is now the 
leading task in agriculture and rural work. All localities 
should take effective measures to ensure bumper summer grain 
harvests and to lay a solid foundation for bumper harvests 
throughout the year. 
  From 4 to 6 April, Wen Jiabao visited Xushui, Rongcheng, and 
Dingxing in Hebei to assess the growth of wheat crops, as well 
as preparations for plowing and sowing on cotton fields. He 
also visited peasants' households, and held informal discussions 
with grass-roots cadres, peasants, and people. He carried out 
investigations and studies on such matters as spring plowing and 
production, as well as the supply of agricultural means of 
production. 
  Wen Jiabao said: The overall situation of reform, 
development, and stability is contingent on accomplishing this 
year's rural work; on bringing about quite favorable 
developments in agriculture and the rural economy; and on 
ensuring the production and supply of grain, cotton, cooking 
oil, and nonstaple foodstuffs in the "shopping basket." All 
localities should seriously implement the guidelines of the 
central rural work conference, earnestly give priority to 
agriculture and rural work, complete all tasks related to 
agriculture and rural areas for this year, and create a good 
economic environment and a stable social environment for the 
smooth implementation of major state reform measures and for the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy. 
  Wen Jiabao said emphatically: To accomplish this year's 
rural work, the most important task of the moment is to carry 
out spring plowing. He said: Ensuring bumper summer grain 
harvests as an initial step for the rest of the year could lay a 
good foundation for this year's bumper harvests. To this end, 
we must accomplish the following tasks: 1) Making overall plans 
for spring plowing and production, especially effectively 
implementing measures for increasing grain and cotton acreage 
and output, allocating seeds, and supplying agricultural means 
of production; 2) concentrating on field management for summer 
crops, popularizing crucial measures for increasing output, and 
raising unit yield; 3) providing materials, as well as technical 
and information services, for spring plowing and production, and 
tightening supervision and management over the market for 
agricultural means of production; and 4) improving disaster 
prevention and relief work, and ensuring spring sowing and 
summer harvesting through drought relief measures. He urged 
leading cadres at all levels to go into the thick of reality, 
work in a down-to-earth manner, unearth problems on a timely 
basis, solve problems, and accomplish this year's agricultural 
production and rural work. 
  Li Bingliang, deputy secretary of the Hebei Provincial CPC 
Committee, accompanied him during the trip.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhaoguo, chief of the United Front Work </F>
Department: "An Outstanding Achievement" -- first paragraph is 
editor's note] 
  [Text] To give publicity to the CPC-led multiparty 
cooperative and political consultative system, the relevant 
department recently compiled the large picture album: "Famous 
Democratic Party and Nonparty Personalities of China." For the 
first time in China, this picture album comprehensively displays 
the features of Chinese democratic party and nonparty 
personalities, thereby portraying an angle of the success of 
cooperation between our party and personalities outside the 
party. Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chief 
of the CPC Central Committee's United Front Work Department, 
wrote the preface to the picture album. 
  The pace of history is advancing speedily toward the 21st 
century. A review of this century makes us understand that the 
main factors that have brought about profound changes in Chinese 
society are reform and revolution. Hearing the clarion call of 
the revolution, the predecessors and progressive forces of the 
Chinese revolution, represented by Sun Yat-sen, overthrew the 
reactionary rule of the Qing Dynasty, thus ending some 2,000 
years of the feudal autocratic system in China. The Chinese 
communists, represented by Mao Zedong, led the Chinese people in 
overthrowing the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, 
and bureaucrat capitalism, thus making China arise in the East. 
  In the historic choice for reform, the Chinese communists, 
represented by Deng Xiaoping, have sought truth from facts, 
emancipated their minds, unswervingly taken the road of 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and made world-renowned 
achievements. 
  One of the most outstanding achievements in this great, epic 
practice is the CPC-led multiparty cooperative and political 
consultative system. 
  This achievement has enabled the CPC to unite with all 
forces 
that can be united and to enjoy the broadest possible sympathy 
and support. This achievement has enabled a large number of 
Chinese with lofty ideals to find the glorious path to serving 
the motherland; participating in decisions on China's future and 
in the formulation of major state policies; and contributing 
their wisdom and efforts to the motherland's independence, 
freedom, democracy, and prosperity. 
  A philosopher once said that history will not forget those 
who created history. By providing pictures and explanations, 
this large picture album being presented to readers has 
collected for the first time the exploits of fanous Chinese 
democratic party and nonparty personalities who have 
participated in creating this glorious history, so as to display 
their features to the whole country and the world. Without 
question, this achievement will become richer and more 
developed, and will shine with even more splendor in the 
historic course of peacefully reunifying the motherland and 
achieving the Chinese nation's great revitalization under the 
leadership of the CPC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core.

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Punishments will now be 
handed out for transporting, selling, storing and using poppy 
capsules illegally; disturbing public order and damaging 
people's health through religious activities; and stirring up 
conflicts between nationalities, hurting unity of nationalities 
and inciting separation of nationalities. 
  These are three of the 18 new offenses which have been 
included in the draft supplementary provisions to the 
regulations governing offenses against public order, which was 
submitted to the current session of the Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislative body, 
for deliberation this morning. 
  Minister of public security, Tao Siju, explained to the 
session that along with the present changing social order, some 
new problems and offenses have occurred which have disturbed the 
social order and public security and hurt public interests. 
  "However, the original regulations had made no provisions 
about these activities and it has become difficult to handle 
these cases according to law," said the minister. 
  The existing regulation was put into effect on January 1, 
1987. 
  Other newly prescribed offenses include: 
  -- disobeying the provisions on the management of social 
organizations, and carrying out activities under the name of a 
social organization without registration; or to keep on working 
under the name of social organization after its registration was 
revoked, it has been ordered to disband, or simply banned; 
  -- organizing activities of superstitious sects and secret 
societies to disrupt public order, do harm to the public 
interest, or damage people's health through feudal superstition; 
  -- disobeying supervisory provisions while undergoing a 
period of being put under surveillance, or deprivation of 
political rights, probation with suspended prison sentence or 
being paroled. 
  Those who commit such offenses, but not to the extent to be 
punished according to criminal law, will be put under 15 days 
detention, with fines of up to 200 yuan or a warning. 
  Meanwhile, those fabricating or distorting facts, spreading 
rumors or otherwise disrupting public order, or doing harm to 
the public interest through other means, will be put under 15 
days detention and ordered to write a confession or warning, if 
the offenses are still not severe enough for criminal punishment.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Sun Chunying (1327 2504 5391): "A </F>
Comprehensive View of Public Order in Rural Areas"] 
  [Text] I. 
  What is the present situation of public order in rural areas 
after all? This is an issue about which people are universally 
concerned. 
  Since reform and opening up, party committees, governments, 
and functional departments in various localities have focused 
closely on economic construction as the central task, persisted 
in building the material and spiritual civilizations 
simultaneously, and put into comprehensive effect various 
measures for the overall control of social security, so that the 
public order situation in rural areas is generally stable. 
People longing for stability and good order are the mainstream 
of rural society at present. 
  It is also necessary, however, to note calmly that the 
public 
order problem remains comparatively conspicuous in some rural 
areas. A small number of places are in a state of chaos, and the 
situation in a few places -- where peasants have expressed 
strong feelings of dissatisfaction -- is relatively serious. 
  What are the manifestations of prominent problems concerning 
social security in rural areas at present? 
  In recent years, crime has increased continuously in rural 
areas. In a few places, serious cases of violence -- including 
murders, explosions, injuries, and other incidents -- have 
increased by a larger margin than in cities. According to 
statistics, there were more than 1.61 million cases of crime 
throughout the country in 1993. Of this total, serious offenses 
exceeded 530,000. In rural areas, the total number of cases 
exceeded 750,000, and serious cases numbered more than 160,000. 
  Various kinds of evil forces -- including "village tyrants 
[ba 7218]," "land tyrants," "water tyrants," "grain tyrants," 
and so -- on have emerged in a small number of rural areas and 
become a ferocious force that has jeopardized social security. 
Some of them have even become gangs of an underworld nature. 
According to the study and analysis of these gangs, it has been 
discovered that a great majority of them are composed primarily 
of former criminals who were released after having served their 
prison terms, but who refuse to mend their evil ways. They have 
rounded up groups of rural hooligans who were idling about and 
doing indecent things. These groups have gathered together, 
acting like overlords [ba 7218] and endangering public order in 
rural areas. Some gangs have engaged in frenzied criminal 
activities, such as theft, robbery, rape, blackmail, and so on. 
  "Train robbers and highwaymen" have run rampant, darting 
here 
and there to commit crimes, and seriously affecting rural 
economic development. Criminals have conducted their evil 
activities unscrupulously and in broad daylight, which has made 
passengers and drivers tremble with fear. 
  The problem of lawbreaking activities conducted by people 
from other localities is particularly conspicuous in those areas 
that are relatively developed economically. It has been learned 
that in the river valley areas of northern and southern Jiangsu, 
the alien population accounted for more that 60 percent of the 
crimes committed, and for more than 80 percent in some areas. 
As "nowhere under the sun is a better place to make money than 
Guangdong," in a large number of cities and counties in the 
economically developed Zhu Jiang Delta area, convicts on the run 
and the alien population accounted for more than 70 percent of 
the crimes committed, with the figure reaching 95 percent in 
some localities. 
  Activities aimed at seizing properties, which include 
stealing or looting the facilities of state key construction 
projects, oil fields, power stations, waterworks, and other 
installations, as well as railroad and highway materials, are 
extremely serious. 
  Incidents of armed fighting by the masses, which were 
triggered by disputes over land, forests, irrigation, roads, 
clans, and other causes, have increased. According to 
statistics from the public security departments or bureaus in 24 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, there were 
more than 600 cases of mass armed fighting in rural areas in 
1993, which caused some 100 deaths, approximately 1,000 inuries, 
and direct economic losses amounting to more than 6 million yuan. 
  The forces of rural patriarchal clans have revived in some 
areas, and activities related to feudal superstition and 
reactionary secret societies have gained ground to some extent. 
In a small number of areas, there emerged a situation in which 
clan forces even stood up as equals to grass-roots party and 
government organs, in a vain attempt to take their places. 
  The ugly social phenomena of practicing prostitution, 
patronizing prostitutes, and gambling -- among others -- are 
spreading in rural areas, and such lawbreaking activities as 
abducting and selling women and children are very serious 
too. 

<H8>    II. </H8>
  In the course of covering news at the grass-roots level, 
this 
reporter has learned that the increase in law-and-order problems 
in the countryside was brought about by complicated factors, but 
the primary reason was the ineffectiveness of leading bodies. 
In some localities, rural cadres paid attention only to 
economic work, while neglecting public order and the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization in the rural areas. As a 
result, law and order in some rural areas is out of control. In 
particular, some grass-roots party branches and village 
committees were not well-organized, were weak and loose, or even 
were paralyzed. This resulted in a situation in which no one 
was responsible for the maintenance of law and order. In some 
places, there was no village committee or village party branch 
at all, still less any organizations for public security and 
order. Some local public security committees existed in name 
only, and did not perform any function. As some people 
described the situation: "Good guys dissolved their 
organizations, and bad guys ganged up to do evil." 
  In the second place, the actual input of human and material 
resources into the maintenance of law and order in rural areas 
was far insufficient as compared with actual needs. This found 
expression in the fact that social management and public 
security functions were weakened; the comprehensive measures for 
the maintenance of law and order were not implemented 
effectively; the forces for guaranteeing public security in 
rural areas were insufficient, their organization was loose, and 
their management and operation were disorderly; and insufficient 
attention was paid to security work, the means were ineffective, 
and input was insufficient. 
  The large population and insufficient land caused a large 
number of surplus rural laborers, and the ineffective management 
of this population was also a major factor in the chaotic 
law-and-order situation. Although the surplus labor force was 
somewhat reduced -- thanks to employment offerred by town and 
township enterprises and by laborers traveling away from their 
homes to do business and seek work -- many people in the 
countryside remained idle and were apt to become lawbreakers. 
Some of these people ganged up to do evil and harm the security 
of local communities. There are signs that crimes committed by 
peasants account for an increasing proportion of urban crime, 
and a large number of jobless peasants make up the "reserve 
force" for urban crime. 
  The rapid expansion of people's desire for consumer goods 
and 
their relatively low income formed a sharp contrast, and this 
also made some people lose their psychological balance and 
degenerate into lawbreakers. This tendency was particularly 
obvious among some peasants who had a weak sense of morals and 
the law. They tended to fulfill their desires for getting rich 
by means of breaking the law. In addition, although the peasant 
masses -- as compared with urban residents -- gained real 
benefits from the adoption in the countryside of the contract 
responsibility system with remuneration linked to output, most 
peasants were still short of money. This was a deep-level 
problem that affected rural stability. 
  As for public security work, although great efforts have 
been 
made in recent years to consolidate law and order in rural 
areas, and a great deal of work has been done, this was still 
unsuited to the developing law-and-order situation in the 
countryside. In most places, there were only two or three 
people per rural police station, and there were even one-person 
stations. In some towns and townships there was no police 
station set up. Policemen have been working in difficult 
conditions. The insufficient numbers, shortage of operating 
funds, backward equipment, and other difficulties in police work 
also constrained the effective operation of law enforcement 
organs in the countryside. 
<H8>  III. </H8>
  Effectively maintaining law and order in the countryside is 
an important condition for developing the rural economy. The 
central rural work conferences in 1993 and 1994 both set out 
strict requirements for the rectification of law and order in 
the countryside. In order to implement the central instructions 
properly, the Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of 
Public Security decided to focus efforts on solving problems in 
rural areas, where the incidence of crime was serious, and to 
strive to meet the peasants' expectations for solid results in 
improving the law-and-order situation. 
  Mou Xinsheng, vice minister of public security in charge of 
community law-and-order affairs, recently told this reporter: 
"The law-and-order problems in the countryside have occurred 
against the background of some major changes in people's 
thinking and mentality, and in the forms of economic and social 
organization in rural communities. Such problems are related to 
the situation in which organizational and management work was 
not suited to the rural work as a whole. Therefore, in the new 
situation we should actively study and explore new ways to 
strengthen rural public security work and to consolidate law and 
order in the countryside." 
  Some people of insight have said: In view of the current 
public order problems in rural areas and the fact that the 
proportion of crimes among peasants is rising, the public 
security organs should adopt measures more pertinent to this 
situation. The party committees and local governments at all 
levels should attach importance to guiding the rural public 
security work, and should increase actual manpower, material, 
and financial investment in rural public security work so as to 
meet the needs in the arduous public security tasks in rural 
areas. 

    Efforts should be focused on more sternly cracking down 
on the conspicuous criminal activities in the countryside, such 
as theft, robbery, murder, assault and battery, and the 
abduction of women and children. Anticrime campaigns should be 
launched in good time, on various scales, and in flexible forms 
so as to crack down on certain sensational crimes. In 
particular, the crackdown should be focused on criminal 
syndicates and evildoing forces that endanger law and order in 
certain areas. At the same time, it is necessary to explore 
more effective ways of solving criminal cases and to enhance 
efficiency in the solution of cases. 
  Of course, the settlement of the existing problems in rural 
public order cannot rely only on the isolated work of the public 
security organs, but also must rely on the joint efforts of all 
circles in society and on the adoption of comprehensive measures. 
  When talking about this, Chen Jiping, member of the Central 
Committee for Comprehensive Management of Public Security and 
director of the committee's General Office, said: The primary 
issue is that party and government leaders at all levels must 
really shoulder political responsibility for ensuring the public 
security of local communities, actually strengthen leadership 
over the work of exercising comprehensive public security 
management, and support law enforcement departments in sternly 
cracking down on criminal activities that seriously harm law and 
order in rural areas. Second, it is necessary to actually 
consolidate the grass-roots party and government organizations 
in the countryside, and to restore and reinvigorate the 
paralyzed and semiparalyzed village organizations through 
comprehensive rectification in terms of ideology, work style, 
and organization. Third, the mass organizations for maintaining 
law and order should be strengthened, and the mechanisms for 
cooperation between local residents and the police also should 
be consolidated. In particular, the rural public security 
committees and the civil mediation committees should be 
organized properly. Fourth, legal education should be conducted 
for grass-roots cadres and the masses so that they will better 
understand the law, and will carry out activities to maintain 
law and order in their own communities according to the law. 
Fifth, attention should be paid to making good use of the 
surplus labor force in the countryside and to doing something 
effective to help peasants overcome poverty and get rich. 
Sixth, it is necessary to further improve relations between 
cadres and peasants, correctly handle various contradictions 
among the people, and prevent the intensification of such 
contradictions as may affect social stability. 
  Public security and order in the countryside are an 
important 
issue China faces in the late 20th century. As long as we do 
down-to-earth work with a realistic attitude, take effective 
measures, and mobilize the joint efforts of all quarters for 
comprehensive management, then we will change the worrisome 
situation in this regard into a gratifying one, and will bring 
order out of chaos. The successful settlement of this issue will 
have a decisive impact on the vigorous and momentous process of 
modernization in our country, which has a large rural 
population, on into the 21st century.

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The eight-day Seventh 
Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National 
People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, opened here today. 
  The participants first heard reports on the examination on 
the draft laws on foreign trade and state compensation, and a 
draft decision on punishing violators in the management of 
companies and enterprises. 
  The reports held that the two draft laws and the draft 
decision, after repeated examination and revision, are generally 
feasible. They therefore proposed that the drafts be adopted by 
the Standing Committee of the NPC. 
  Tao Siju, minister of public security, read to the 
legislators draft supplementary provisions to regulations 
governing offenses against public order which, targeted at 
newly-emerging problems and phenomena, define 18 new offenses. 
  Yu Yongbo, director of the General Political Department, 
explained the draft amendments to the regulations on active 
service and rank of military officers of the People's Liberation 
Army. 
  He said that the revision of the two regulations was meant 
to 
meet increasing needs of the reform and construction drive of 
both the nation and the armed forces. 
  The revised draft amendment to the regulations on military 
rank spell out the disestablishment of first-class (highest 
rank) general. It also stipulates that no military rank will be 
granted to the chairman of the Central Military Commission, and 
the rank for vice chairmen of the commission is that of general. 
  The draft amendment to the regulations on active service 
takes two to three years off the ceiling age for officers of 
deputy-army level, officers at the level of deputy 
commander-in-chief for the greater military areas and officers 
with elementary professional posts. 
  According to a report on the draft Law on Management of 
Urban 
Real Estate, delivered by Vice Minister of Construction Ye 
Rutang, the development of the real estate industry will on the 
one hand provide the basic material foundation for urban 
economic growth, and on the other hand help improve the living 
standards of urban residents. 
  The minister said that the position of the real estate 
industry in the national economy and its role in social progress 
have obliged it to be standardized, guided, promoted and secured 
by law. 
  The draft decision on punishing criminals violating 
copyrights stipulates that copyright violators can meet with 
punishment ranging from five years in prison to detention and 
fines. 
  The legislators also heard explanations on the draft laws on 
judges and prosecutors made respectively by Supreme People's 
Court President Ren Jianxin and Procurator-General of the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate Zhang Siqing. 
  Ren said that for more than four decades China has not had a 
law on judges, who are both state functionaries and 
professionals. Legislation in the field is very necessary for 
the scientific and standardized management of custodians of the 
law, he said. 
  Zhang said the law on prosecutors is aimed at establishing a 
mechanism to restrict the behavior of prosecutors. 
  Today's meeting was presided over by Qiao Shi, chairman of 
the NPC Standing Committee.

DACIDIAN' is an very influential set of books both at home and 
abroad. Its publication is of great significance. This sort of 
encyclopedia is an agglomeration of a country's national 
language, embodying the traditional culture of the country and 
its people, and it is usually regarded as a symbol of national 
honor and national independence. For this reason, the 
government and the people of any country always attach 
importance to such an encyclopedia. China is a great country 
with 5,000 years of history and splendid culture. The Chinese 
nation is a great nation which has contributed to civilization 
of the world. Besides, the Chinese language is used by more 
than one billion people in the world. We should have an 
encyclopedia which can reflect the whole picture of the Chinese 
language." (Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese 0426 GMT

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- A draft law on China's 
emerging real estate business was submitted to the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation 
today. 
  The Law on Urban Real Estate Management (draft), on which 
officials and experts have worked for six years, is expected to 
provide the legal basis for real estate development and make it 
a pillar of the national economy. 
  The draft contains 79 articles in seven chapters governing 
use of land for real estate development, housing property 
development, real estate trading, registration of real estate 
property rights and other subjects. 
  In explaining the draft to the NPC Standing Committee, Vice 
Minister of Construction Ye Rutang noted the rapid expansion of 
real estate development in recent years. 
  "But a host of problems cry for resolution, and provision of 
a legal base is the fundamental solution," the official said. 
  According to the draft, transfer of land shall, in most 
cases, be executed through auction or bidding. 
  Under specific circumstances, however, land may be 
transferred through negotiated agreement with approval of the 
State Council or a higher level authority of the local 
government with the power to approve such matters. 
  The draft specifies that land for construction of 
commercial, 
tourist and reactional facilities as well as villas shall be 
transferred through auction or bidding. 
  According to statistics available to XINHUA, of the total 
amount of land obtained for construction between early 1992 and 
July 1993, bidding was employed for only 0.78 percent and 
auction for another 0.32 percent. 
  The rest was obtained either by administrative allocations 
or 
through negotiated agreement. 
  To uphold the state monopoly over urban land, the draft 
stipulates that transfer of land shall conform to the overall 
planning for use of land and urban development and be 
incorporated with the construction of specific projects. 
  The land developer, says the draft, must abide by the 
contractual terms for the development project on the land and 
within the contractual period for the development. 
  With regard to advance sales of housing property, the draft, 
apparently to prevent profiteering speculation, prohibits 
transfer of housing already sold but not yet finished and 
occupied.

  [Text] Beijing has put pressure on a group of liberal 
intellectuals to stop publishing an avant-garde journal. The 
authorities have also tried to boost the sales and influence of 
the People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO] by launching several regional 
editions. 
  Chinese sources said yesterday the editors of the magazine 
JINGPIN (ELITE) could not find an official book registration 
number to publish its third edition. The two previous editions 
had been published earlier this year under a temporary 
registration number, which had expired. 
  The editors and contributors of JINGPIN are influential 
intellectuals and ex-officials associated with the former party 
chiefs Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. They include former PEOPLE'S 
DAILY editor Qin Chuan, former culture minister Wang Meng, and 
liberal economist Yu Guangyuan. While this group did not openly 
support the 1989 democracy movement, it is understood that the 
authorities fear the liberal intellectuals might give "spiritual 
support" to the underground dissident movement. 
  "All the articles for the third edition are ready," a source 
close to the magazine said. "Our failure to get a registration 
number is a sign the authorities are getting tough with dissent." 
  Meanwhile, the Propaganda Department of the party is anxious 
to reverse the decline in the sales of a large number of 
official mouthpieces, including the PEOPLE'S DAILY, whose 
circulation last year reportedly dropped by almost 20 percent. 
Media analysts in Beijing said the party had given the green 
light for the paper to launch several regional editions, the 
first of which will appear in the East China area. 
  Cadres on the People's Daily said they hoped the new 
editions, which will have more local content, would help to stem 
the decline in circulation. It will be the first launch of 
regional editions by a national paper. 
  Sources in the paper said the editorial policy remained 
"rigid and doctrinaire" despite the appointment in the past year 
of two moderates, Fan Jingyi and Zhou Ruijin, as chief editor 
and vice- chief editor. Mr Zhou, considered a protege of 
President Jiang Zemin, sat at the same table as Mr Jiang when 
the latter hosted a Lunar New Year banquet for the leaders of 
the Beijing media. 
  While the authorities are clamping down on liberal journals, 
they have not stopped efforts by the Maoist ideologues to 
discredit the reform policy. Chinese sources said commissars 
led by Deng Liqun, a former head of propaganda, had started 
writing a series of articles on how patriarch Deng Xiaoping's 
open-door policy could encourage the growth of capitalism and a 
"new class of exploiters". These articles are to be published 
after the death of Mr Deng. 
  The sources said Mr Deng and his family were aware of the 
"anti-reform articles," but they had decided not to take action. 
Moreover, the remnant Maoists still have a stranglehold over 
many departments within the Central Committee. The sources 
added that to ensure his predominant position in the post-Deng 
era, Mr Jiang had formed alliances with the ideologues.

<F P=106> ["It Seems to Me" column by Kang Bing from the "Opinion" </F>
page: "Dear Leaders: `We Have To Stop Meeting This Way'"] 
  [Text] "I'd like to talk with you, but I'm sorry, I have 
meetings all day today." This is the answer we reporters often 
receive when trying to arrange interviews. 
  Even if we manage to see the VIPs, they tend to glance 
continually at their watches. Some even cut the interviews 
short because of the ubiquitous meeting. 
  There are reports about a governor who was so tied-up with 
meetings that he was unable to go to his office for a month. 
Some work institutions even select leaders whose responsibility 
is simply to attend various meetings. 
  The government has made persevering efforts to decrease the 
number of meetings. Still, meetings go on in profusion, all 
claiming to have good reasons for their existence. 
  A round-the-year meeting calendar goes like this: A meeting 
must be held at the beginning of the year to discuss and set 
down work plans. A year-end meeting is naturally convened for 
summarizing the plans. In between the kick-off and close, there 
are the inevitable meetings to exchange experiences, read 
documents and award prizes. And many others. 
  Ironically, an important part of the year-end meeting is to 
report on the number of meetings that have been held over the 
year. 
  To maintain good relations with various departments, work 
institutions have to give a nod to meeting invitations from 
almost all sources, including their superior organizations, 
friendly counterparts and the local public service bodies. 
  To pass up an invitation is considered an insult. If the 
local traffic control office is unhappy, all your vehicles may 
be accused of being in poor condition and be ordered off the 
road; if the local neighbourhood committee is displeased, you 
might be fined for "failing to keep the environment clean 
enough." Reject an invitation -- and you will be rejected. 
  Of course, many people are only too pleased to be invited to 
meetings and harvest all the freebies--free trips, big feasts 
and souvenirs. 
  Though I have been to too many meetings--quite often 
reluctantly--I am not totally against them. What I hate are the 
meaningless and long ones. 
  The Chinese Communists have been known for their talent in 
mobilizing people to rise up against practices left over from 
the old feudal society. Such mobilizations were often done 
through meetings in which revolutionary principles were 
explained and problems concerning the interests of the 
participants were discussed. People were enthusiastic about 
going to such meetings. 
  But since the establishment of the People's Republic, this 
once-effective weapon has been excessively used. As a result, 
it has lost its power. Most meetings are met with a 
"never-again" attitude. Few are interested in what's discussed 
in the meetings. Moreover, I doubt if the attendants are really 
able to carry out what's assigned to them at the meetings. 
  The number of meetings held around the country is not 
available, but I believe the figure could run in the millions. 
  As far as I know, most government organizations and 
enterprises still have Wednesday afternoons off for so-called 
"political study" meetings. 
  I believe most people are bored with such routine meetings, 
in which newspaper articles are read by a responsible leader 
while the participants busily engage in chatting, dozing or 
knitting. 
  Having such weekly meetings might be a decades-old practice 
and there might be some argument to keep them going, but I would 
advise meeting organizers to cancel them if they want to improve 
the unit's efficiency and productivity. 
  It is a waste of time and money to hold these meetings if 
they achieve nothing. 
  Billions of yuan must be needed to organize these millions 
of 
meetings. I am no expert on this affair, but friends tell me 
that, in organizing a meeting, the budget ranges from a few 
thousand yuan to half a million. It's time that we dampened the 
meeting fever of both organizers and participants. 
  They should be reminded that, if a meeting has to be held, 
something concrete should be discussed, and decisions should be 
made. Empty talk has no value. 
  Now that the management mechanism is being reformed in 
enterprises, managers should be accountable for their own 
actions. They should decide things for themselves and not 
involve half the factory. If they do, it only shows their sense 
of insecurity and lack of business confidence. 
  Traditionally, in appraising an organization's performance, 
the number of meetings it held was regarded as a standard of its 
achievements. But the new concept should be: The fewer 
meetings held, the better. 
  The best and most efficient way to cut down on the number of 
meetings, it seems to me, is to slash the meeting budget 
drastically. Who would attend if there were no banquets or 
carrier bags full of goodies? Who would organize if they had to 
reach into their own pockets? The money saved could be put to 
good use in an infinite number of ways--such as paying the 
teachers who have been given IOUs instead of their salaries. 
  It requires great determination and a new way of thinking to 
bid farewell to meetings. 
  The Hebei provincial government has set a good example. It 
decided to have no meetings in the entire month of April. The 
leaders, liberated from meeting engagements, could head to all 
corners of the province during that month for on-the-spot 
investigations, which helped their decision making far more than 
meetings ever would. 
  When this directive was issued in March, many people were 
skeptical that, without meetings, things in the province would 
fall apart into a real mess. 
  Now the month has passed, and we can see that the sky did 
not 
fall. 
  I hope other provinces and organizations will follow the 
Hebei example, and I also hope Hebei's no-meeting period will be 
prolonged from the present one month to two months -- or longer.

<F P=106> [Interview by staff reporter Zhou Qing (0719 1987) with </F>
Liang Heng, Deputy Director of the State Press and Publications 
Administration; date, place not given: "A Common Problem For 
Almost 10,000 Kinds of Newspapers and Publications Is To Improve 
Quality -- Liang Heng, Deputy Director of the State Press and 
Publications Administration, Answers This Reporter's Questions"] 
  [Text] [Zhou] There are now 2,040 kinds of newspapers and 
7,596 kinds of magazines in China, totaling 9,636 kinds. The 
increase in their numbers is astonishing. These almost 10,000 
kinds of publications are important weapons in fostering 
socialist spiritual civilization. They are busily providing 
readers with spiritual food and are greatly affecting all of 
society. Facing this unprecedented situation, what are the main 
guiding principles of the State Press and Publications 
Administration in its management over publications? 
  [Liang] There is a need to change two concepts in 
publications management at present. First, attention should be 
switched from increasing the quantity to improving the quality. 
As Comrade Ding Guangen [chief of the Propaganda Department] 
has pointed out: Macromanagement over propaganda and culture 
should be strengthened, with attention paid to providing 
guidance, controlling the total amount, improving the 
composition, and producing better results. This is also an 
important task of the State Press and Publications 
Administration. Of course, we can discuss whether these almost 
10,000 kinds are adequate or not. As a matter of fact, they 
will increase in the future. The most urgent problem at 
present, however, is to review their quality, whether their 
composition is rational or not, and how their results are. For 
a time in the past, the department in charge focused its 
attention on running new publications and did not care much 
about problems emerging in publications. As a result, a 
situation arose in which "new publications were increasing" and 
"the bad coexisted with the good." This situation must be 
changed. The existing publications should be managed and run 
well before running new publications. At least, there should be 
basically no approval for new publications in the near future. 
  Second, tough criteria should be set for management. There 
are two criteria in press and publications management. One is 
the minimum criterion, which means that a publication must meet 
publication standards, its contents must not violate state law, 
and its publication procedures must not go against publication 
regulations. Some of the publications that have met this 
criterion are neither good nor bad; others are borderline cases; 
still others are like certain industrial enterprises -- 
consuming much, but producing low economic results. It will not 
do to maintain our management at this level. The other 
criterior is the maximum, which requires publications to be 
first-rate in all aspects. Requiring every issue of a 
publication to be problem-free may be a little excessive, but 
this can be achieved if efforts are made. This criterion is 
determined by the particularity of publications. For example, 
management over material products is like filling a bamboo 
basket with bricks; it does not matter if the basket is woven 
tightly, or a little loosely. Management over spiritual 
products is like filling a pail with water, allowing no leakage. 
Let us compare management over material products to repairing a 
highway; if there is a hole on the highway, a car can still 
skirt it. Management over spiritual products is like repairing 
an aqueduct; if there is a breach in one of the dikes, the 
aqueduct will leak. 
  This high criterion is for the sake of the people, the 
reader, and the next generation. A manager should be very 
careful, as careful as walking on a thin ice; on the other hand, 
he should be brave and firm, and try to achieve the best results. 
  [Zhou] On publications' quality criteria, what specific 
management requirements do you have in mind? 
  [Liang] Whether or not a publication is run well depends, 
generally speaking, on whether or not it can fulfill the main 
task set by General Secretary Jiang Zemin for current propaganda 
and ideological work. This main task is to hold firm to the 
fundamental principle of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, to arm the people with scientific 
theory, to guide the people with correct public opinion, to 
create good images with a noble spirit for the people, and to 
encourage the people with fine works. There are six primary 
aspects of quality in terms of what can be seen in the layout 
(there is also personnel quality and operational situation 
relating to the layout): 
  1. Political quality -- Unquestionably, the first demand on 
newspapers and publications is a correct and firm political 
orientation. On the one hand, this is because newspapers and 
publications are spiritual food, and rotten food should not be 
given to others; as mass media, newspapers and publications 
should not mislead the country by providing wrong guidance. On 
the other hand, newspapers and publications have a commercial 
nature, and publishers frequently overlook social effects out of 
commercial motives. The political quality of newspapers and 
publications is sometimes like a boat sailing against the 
current: A slight absence of mind could weaken their political 
quality. 
  2. Information quality -- As we are focusing on economic 
construction and on developing the socialist market economy, we 
should particularly stress the importance of information. This 
is the main function of newspapers and publications in serving 
the four modernizations. For periodicals, information quality 
alone is not adequate, there also should be academic quality. 
  3. Cultural quality -- Newspapers and publications fall into 
the category of culture. Their cultural quality has a direct 
impact on readers' sentiments. 
  4. Publishing quality -- This refers to the quality of 
editing, proofreading, composition, printing, and binding. 
  5. Advertising quality -- The development of the socialist 
market economy has brought about the great development of the 
advertising business. Publishing advertisements has become 
another main function of newspapers and publications in serving 
society. In particular, advertisements have occupied large 
spaces in newspapers. Whether an advertisement is true or false, 
poorly or beautifully printed, directly affects the newspaper's 
quality. 
  6. Circulation quality -- All the functions of newspapers 
and publications finally manifest themselves when they reach the 
reader. No matter how much a newspaper contains, it must have a 
certain quantity. Under the socialist market economy structure, 
in which efficiency and results are valued highly, the amount in 
circulation should be taken as the basic factor in assessing the 
quality of newspapers and publications and as a necessary 
assessment criterion. 
  For newspapers and publications in open circulation, none of 
these six aspects of quality are dispensable. 
  [Zhou] What is the management policy to ensure the 
fulfillment of these requirements? 
  [Liang] First, we should control the quantity and improve 
the 
quality, with the focus on two procedures -- one being an 
approval procedure and the other being a routine management 
procedure. 
  1. "Three principles" on management over approval. 
  This year three principles on approval have been 
implemented: 
Basically no approval is granted; approval is granted after an 
adjustment; and approval is decided on improvement in 
management. After a large increase in newspapers and 
publications over the last few years, they basically have coped 
with economic construction and the people's cultural needs. 
Therefore, approval for new newspapers and publications 
basically has stopped this year. If provinces and units wish to 
run new newspapers and publications, they should reduce the 
original newspapers and publications. The number of new 
newspapers and publications to be approved depends on the number 
of old newspapers and publications reduced. No approval will be 
granted to new newspapers and publications if the old newspapers 
and publications are not reduced, the purpose being to promote 
the good and eliminate the bad. In addition, management quality 
will be taken into account; no approval will be granted if 
management does not improve. This will be taken as a condition 
so as to improve management. 
  2. "Three measures" for daily management. 
  Daily management gradually should take on a procedural 
nature 
and should proceed in a scientific way, with the aim of 
establishing a normal and effective mechanism. First, we should 
pay attention to assessment. An annual assessment of newspapers 
and publications will be carried out so as to make them meet 
minimum criteria. After an assessment, bad-quality newspapers 
and publications with a low circulation must be eliminated 
resolutely. Second, we should pay attention to appraising the 
good so that the good will meet the maximum criteria. This was 
begun many years ago, and the results were very good. In a 
region and a department, there is a need to establish several 
influential newspapers and publications to promote the rest. 
Third, we should pay attention to grading. After fulling the 
first and second measures, scientific grading gradually will be 
introduced to all newspapers and publications to form a rational 
management mechanism. After grading, different management will 
be exercised over advertisements, distribution, operations, and 
position titles. The grades of newspapers and publications will 
be adjusted according to the annual assessment and appraisal, 
forming a normal, self-restrictive, and stimulative mechanism. 
  To summarize, there are two transformations, six criteria, 
three principles, and three measures. In the past, our main 
efforts were devoted to increasing the number of newspapers and 
publications. Now efforts should be switched to improving 
quality. This is a difficult change, but we are confident of 
carrying out this task.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Strive To Put on First-Rate Work </F>
Performance for the Motherland"] 
  [Text] The divine flame of the 17th winter Olympics has 
gone out, but the heroism of Ye Qiaobo -- a worthy daughter of 
the Chinese nation, who fought indomitably to enable the 
five-starred flag to be hoisted up the pole, despite injuries to 
her legs and other parts of her body -- still stirs the heart of 
every Chinese citizen. Ye has composed a magnificent song of 
youth with her blood, sweat, and tears, and has set a brilliant 
example of patriotism to a generation of youth. 
  A feeble girl, who made light of her major injury and 
refused 
to be outdone by her strong rivals, made amazing achievements in 
the world-level competition. Where did her strength come from? 
Ye answered: "What I have done is done for my beloved 
motherland." What a noble heart she has! She consciously 
regarded rendering service to her motherland as her highest 
ambition, and was ready to exchange her youth for her 
motherland's honor and her nation's dignity. It was her 
passionate patriotism that constituted the abundant source of 
her heroism. 
  Patriotism has always been a spiritual prop for a strong and 
prosperous country and a rising nation. The implications of 
patriotism vary from nation to nation. For the younger 
generation of the Chinese nation, loving their country has the 
particular meaning of loving socialism. Historical experience 
and the reality of reform and opening up to the outside world 
have told us that socialism cannot only save, but also develop 
China. Ye has been to a dozen countries and regions, and has 
witnessed Western societies of every description. While abroad, 
she did not improperly belittle herself, worship and have blind 
faith in everything foreign, and still less shake her 
conviction. Instead, she bore in mind "I am my motherland's 
loyal daughter," took pride in it, and displayed a national 
integrity that was neither arrogant nor obsequious, and "made 
one above the power of poverty and mean conditions to cause a 
deviation from principle, one who could not be subdued by force." 
  Loving one's country means linking one's career and future 
with one's motherland, and changing fervent patriotism into the 
real action of dedicating oneself to the service of one's 
country. Ye dedicated herself to the service of her country by 
applying herself to sports -- her career -- and by trying hard 
to win a "gold medal" for her country. She has worked hard and 
dauntlessly on speed skating -- her difficult and glorious 
career -- for 20 years, and has made great achievements time and 
again in scaling new heights in speed skating. People work at 
different posts, but they can have the same wish to render 
service to their motherland despite the fact that they will 
carry out the wish on different occasions and in different ways. 
To carry out the wish, one must base oneself on one's work post 
and start with little things so as to make outstanding 
achievements at one's ordinary work post. 
  Loving one's country means rendering great service to reform 
and the opening up. Ye always cherished a high aspiration for 
winning honor for her motherland and set the highest target for 
herself. After winning honor for her motherland on many 
occasions and becoming a glorious sportswoman in the sports 
field, many people told her to resolutely retire at the height 
of her career, but Ye declined their advice. She felt she had 
not realized her ambition and wanted to convert her dream of 
obtaining a gold medal for her motherland into reality -- a 
dream, in fact, of turning China into a prosperous country. How 
striking a contrast she brought out between herself and those 
who pride themselves on their merits or are content with small 
achievements! 
  Being patriotic means combating decadent ideas, such as 
individualism and money worship. To render service to repay her 
motherland's kindness, Ye bore hardships unbearable for ordinary 
people and buried the happiness ordinary people deserve. She 
regarded her motherland's honor as a weight like unto Mount Tai, 
and her own interests weighing as lightly as a goose feather. 
Such a noble virtue, which "enables a patriot to dash ahead 
regardless of his own safety," is all the more precious in the 
current period when a new system is replacing the old. 
  "One must not forget one's duty to take care of the 
country's 
interests, no matter how insignificant one may be." Youth 
represent the future of the country and are to bring the 
country's major plans to fruition. Ye's heroism has shown the 
broad masses of young people a correct and glorious way for them 
to render loyal service to the motherland. This is the great 
trust history has placed in them and also what the current 
reform era expects of them. Like Ye, we should keep the 
motherland's interests at heart, carry forward the revolutionary 
cause pioneered by our predecessors, forge ahead into the 
future, and participate in the country's great reform and 
development plans with enormous enthusiasm and creativity. We 
should work hard to make progress and achievements at our own 
posts. We should inject our precious youth into the motherland's 
great cause of reform and development to put on a first-rate 
work performance!

<F P=106> [By Chang Hong: "NPC Plans To Reshuffle Top Military </F>
Rankings"] 
  [Text] The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is set to do 
away with its highest ranking position--a post no one has ever 
held. 
  The Central Military Commission (CMC) yesterday proposed 
eliminating the status of `first-grade general,' theoretically 
the highest ranking official in the armed forces. 
  The commission also recommended the Standing Committee of 
the 
National People's Congress [NPC] give officers regular salary 
raises and cut the retirement age of senior commanders by two 
years--all under a package of amendments to existing military 
service regulations. 
  The `first-grade' general position has remained vacant since 
it was adopted in 1988. The Chinese president, a civilian, is 
the commander of the armed forces and serves as CMC chairman. 
  Under the amendments, the CMC chairman will not be conferred 
with any military ranks. This will be in line with the 
tradition of the Chinese military and the general practice in 
the world, said General Yu Yongbo, a CMC member and director of 
the PLA General Political Department. 
  Yu said the decision to remove the first-grade general from 
the military ladder was based on the fact that no one ever held 
the title. 
  The post-Cold War era of peace also prompted the proposal, 
he 
said. 
  The current military rank system divides officers in active 
service into 11 grades, from generals and field officers to 
junior officers. 
  Ten grades will be retained: general, lieutenant general, 
major general, senior colonel, colonel, lieutenant colonel, 
major, captain, lieutenant and second lieutenant. 
  Amendments to the retirement age mainly affect deputy army 
commanders and deputy commanders of greater military areas, 
according to Yu. 
  The maximum retirement age will be reduced from 60 to 58 for 
deputy army commanders and 65 to 63 for deputy commander of 
greater military command regions. 
  This would accelerate the normal succession of officers. 
  Yu said the proposal for regular pay hikes for officers is 
intended to boost military morale. 
  Other legislation under review at the current NPC Standing 
Committee session includes the Foreign Trade Law, the draft 
State Compensation Law and measures to punish offenders 
disturbing public order. 
  The first two bills are ready to be approved during the 
current session, which runs until Thursday. 
  For the first time, a law governing the real estate market 
has been submitted to the NPC Standing Committee for 
consideration. 
  The law aims to tighten government control over the industry 
and prevent the loss of State property. 
  Its provisions focus on the supply of land for urban real 
estate development, real estate transactions and property 
registration. 
  Legislators also heard a report on introducing sterner 
penalties on copyright infringements. 
  Two draft laws governing the service of judges and 
prosecutors were also submitted for review. 
  Under the laws, ranking systems will be introduced to

  [Excerpts] Last evening, the provincial government held an 
urgent teleconference on production safety in order to circulate 
information on the serious gas explosion accident that took 
place on 1 May in the Pingku coal mine under the (Fengchang) 
Mining Bureau, as well as the workplace injury incident that 
took place at the (Xingyi) power station construction site. The 
government urged that earnest lessons be drawn, which have been 
paid for with blood, and that powerful measures be adopted to 
effectively ensure safety in production. At the teleconference, 
which was presided over by Vice Governor Shu Shengyou, Governor 
Wu Guanzheng and Vice Governor Zhang Yunchuan delivered 
important speeches. The meeting urged that All localities 
should uphold the idea of safety first and of putting prevention 
first, and effectively strengthen leadership over production 
safety work. The leading comrades of various localities, 
departments, and enterprises should learn these lessons, which 
have been paid for in blood from these two malignant accidents, 
which caused injuries and deaths; further understand the 
importance and urgency of strengthening production safety from 
the heights of maintaining stability and accelerating 
development; and enhance the sense of responsibility and urgency 
in doing a good job in production safety in the spirit of being 
highly responsible to the party and the people. Efforts should 
be made to conduct thoroughgoing education in production safety 
and to comprehensively enhance the sense of production safety 
among the broad masses of employees. [passage omitted] 
  The principal leaders of administrative bodies in various 
localities and departments, as well as representatives of 
enterprise legal persons, are those who assume principal 
responsibility for production safety in their own departments 
and units. They should personally take up and check production 
safety work. [passage omitted] 
  The production safety work in key trades, enterprises, and 
units should be effectively strengthened. All departments -- 
particularly coal, chemical industrial, and metallurgical 
production enterprises; inflammable and explosive goods 
production, warehousing, and transport units; the building 
industry; and the communications and transportation sector -- 
should further strengthen safety management in key enterprises 
in line with the principle of paying simultaneous attention to 
both production and safety. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting urged the launching of a mass production-safety 
survey throughout the province. Effective measures should be 
taken to earnestly handle hidden safety problems, if discovered.

  [Text] Jiangsu Province, which captures one-fifth of 
China's market of audio and video products, consolidated its 
audio and video market by cracking down on piracy of compact 
discs. It confiscated over 10,000 pirated compact discs in 
April. Early this year, first of all, Jiangsu consolidated 
units producing compact discs in the province, sternly 
investigated and dealt with manufacturers engaged in piracy 
reproduction, established a system for the reproduction 
processing manufacturers to report their products to the 
authorities for examination, and, meanwhile, publicized the 
copyright law by explaining to the masses the knowledge of how 
to identify pirated, counterfeit audio and video products. In 
early April, Jiangsu conducted a general inspection of the audio 
and video market in the whole province. Audio and video 
administrative departmeNts in all areas coordinated with 
departments in charge of industry and commerce, as well as 
public security departments, to repeatedly crack down on piracy 
reproduction of compact discs, thereby effectively dealing a 
blow to their illegal distribution and sales. An inspection team 
formed by relevant state departments praised Jiangsu's audio and 
video market, saying it maintained good order while enjoying 
brisk sales.

<F P=106> ["Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission issues circular </F>
in connection with the bribery case of Yao Guitao and Ju Peijin, 
calling for thorough investigation and handling of embezzlement 
and bribery cases in order to remove corrupt elements from the 
party"] 
  [Text] The Shanghai Municipal CPC Discipline Inspection 
Commission recently issued a circular, which stressed: Party 
and government organizations and leading cadres at all levels 
should realize, from the perspective of reform, development, and 
stability, the importance of the fight against corruption and 
strictly investigate and handle embezzlement and bribery cases 
in order to remove corrupt elements from the party. This is an 
important content of the anticorruption struggle and is also a 
means of removing obstacles to reform and opening to the outside 
world. 
  The circular said: Yao Guitao, former secretary of the party 
committee of Xinjing Township in Changning District (member of 
the district party committee) and chairman of the board of 
directors of the Shanghai Meilian Real Estate Development and 
Enterprising Company, and Ju Peijin, former vice president of 
the Shanghai Municipal Gas Company and deputy chairman of the 
broad of directors of the Shanghai Meilian Real Estate 
Development and Enterprising Company, unscrupulously accepted 
bribes in the first half of 1993 when they participated in a 
joint real estate development project with foreign businessmen. 
It has been verified by a preliminary investigation that Yao 
Guitao accepted a bribe of over 300,000 yuan, and Ju Peijin 
accepted over 400,000 yuan. Their acts have caused serious 
losses to state and collective interests. With the approval of 
the municipal party committee, the Changning District Party 
Committee, the district government, and the municipal public 
utilities bureau decided to expell Yao Guitao and Ju Peijin from 
the party and remove them from their posts. 
  The circular pointed out: Our cadres wield some power 
because they bear the responsibility for reform, opening to the 
outside world, and economic development. This being so, some 
lawbreakers have often made use of the party's cadres in 
achieving their objectives. All cadres should maintain a high 
degree of vigilance against this. In the new historical 
condition, every communist party member is faced with the 
serious challenge of fighting against being corroded. This 
challenge is in no way second to the life-and- death test during 
the war years. Promoting the healthy development of the 
socialist market economy by proceeding from the interests of the 
people and observing honesty and self-discipline -- this 
constitutes one of the codes of conduct all party member cadres 
must follow in the new period. If they go against this norm, 
they will harm the fundamental interests of the state and 
people. If they don't promptly check this trend but allow it to 
develop, it is possible that they will violate law and 
discipline and even commit crime. Party member cadres must 
guard against money temptation, discipline themselves, remain 
honest, and be able to withstand the test of reform, opening to 
the outside world, and of being part of the ruling party.

<F P=106> [By reporters Wang Yunfeng (3769 0061 1496) and Shi Meisi </F>
(0670 5019 3128)] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 4 May (XINHUA) -- During his 29 April-3 
May inspection tour of Guangdong Province, Li Lanqing, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council 
vice premier, pointed out: Foreign trade enjoys good prospects 
this year, but what deserves our attention is the fact that 
costs of producing export-oriented goods are increasing fairly 
rapidly. It is necessary to take severe measures to ban the 
practices of rushing for raw materials at high prices and 
competing for market share by lowering commodity prices; 
otherwise, such practices will severely affect the sustained 
power of our exports. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation has achieved very good results in inviting 
bids for 10 or more export commodities this year, which helps 
curb such ill practices. It is necessary to sum up these 
experiences and spread them as soon as possible. Meanwhile, it 
is imperative to take effective measures to prevent the loss, 
especially the nonnoticeable loss, of the property of 
state-owned foreign trade enterprises. It is necessary to 
invigorate them through reform and to ensure that state-owned 
property maintains and increases its value. The key to 
achieving this goal lies in changing enterprises' management 
mechanism. He expressed his hope that the banking sector will 
provide the necessary circulating funds for those foreign trade 
enterprises with good export earnings and economic performances. 
The areas with good achievements in carrying out the policy of 
reform and opening should take active measures to further 
improve the investment environment, particularly the intangible 
environment, so as to explore new ways to develop foreign trade 
and to attract foreign funds. 
  Accompanied by Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and secretary of Guangdong Province; Guangdong 
Provincial Governor Zhu Senlin; and Wu Yi, minister of the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation; and relevant 
leaders of the State Economic and Trade Commission, Li Lanqing 
inspected the 75th Guangzhou Trade Fair, the Huangpu customs 
office, and the Huangpu bonded zone. He heard reports made by 
responsible comrades of Zhuhai and Zhongshan cities on the work 
of improving foreign trade and attracting foreign funds. He 
inspected the new airport in Zhongshan city. In addition, he 
conducted a comprehensive study of some reform measures to be 
carried out this year. 
  Li Lanqing said: To build a basic framework for our 
socialist market economy, the central authorities have come up 
with many major measures for reforming the systems governing 
fiscal affairs, taxation, banking operations, modern business 
operations, investment, foreign trade, and foreign exchange. 
The performance in the first four months shows that the 
implementation of these measures has been quite stable. The 
problems we have encountered today are not caused by reforms but 
rather are the old system's defects that have been exposed by 
reforms. To deal with these problems, we must count on 
deepening reforms and replacing the operating mechanisms, and 
not by retreating, which has no way out. Leading authorities at 
all levels must consider how to reinvigorate state-owned 
enterprises as an important issue and place it high on their 
agendas. Li Lanqing listened attentively to everybody's ideas 
for reinvigorating state-owned enterprises, especially 
state-owned foreign trade enterprises, and he discussed the 
ideas with them. 
  On special economic zones' future development, Li Lanqing 
pointed out: After 15 years, special economic zones have 
undergone major changes from enjoying preferential treatment and 
flexible measures -- such as paying lower taxes but retaining 
more profits -- to improving their own operating mechanisms and 
accumulating more capital for development. In order to remain 
special, our special economic zones must continue to improve 
their investment environment, especially the intangibles 
environment, in accordance with international norms. To attract 
more investment from large consortia and transnational companies 
in accordance with China's development strategy and industrial 
policy, special zones must use foreign capital more efficiently 
and on more technologically advanced projects. Meanwhile, 
special economic zones should take the lead in launching pilot 
reform projects and adopting good foreign experiences useful for 
China. 
  Li Lanqing was highly interested in educational investment 
and teachers' pay, especially their housing situation. Passing 
through a residential housing area in Zhongshan city, he 
demanded to visit the home of a retired teacher. He was glad to 
see that because of the government's preferential treatment, the 
teacher had living quarters in which each member of his family 
had on average more than 13 square meters of floor space. He 
fully acknowledged the city's experiences in solving teachers' 
housing problems. At a meeting with leaders of Jinan 
University, Li Lanqing stressed that universities should proceed 
with reforms with the objective of achieving higher academic 
quality and better educational results. He said that 
universities should explore a new way to arouse the enthusiasm 
of all quarters and promote educational cooperation at home and 
abroad, and universities should make greater efforts to train 
versatile personnel useful for the development of the market 
economy -- personnel who are knowledgeable about the economy as 
well as about industrial technologies. While the government is 
increasing investment in education, he said, schools must also 
speed up their reforms. Li Lanqing praised Guangdong for its 
attention to education in recent years. 
  Li Lanqing also mentioned that smuggling activities must be 
cracked down on with protracted efforts and on a regular basis, 
and that bonded zones must do a good job in providing storage 
service, handling indirect trade, and processing supplied 
materials according to international norms.

<F P=106> [By Dai Yaping (2071 0068 1627)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 17 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Lu Ruihua, 
executive vice governor of Guangdong Province, said that in the 
first quarter of this year, while actively carrying out fiscal, 
foreign trade, banking, and investment reform, Guangdong 
continued to grasp the opportunity for accelerating development 
and maintained the momentum of economic growth. 
  At a recent meeting in Guangzhou, the provincial government 
analyzed some prominent problems in economic operations and 
worked out solutions. 
  According to Lu Ruihua, in the first quarter, the gross 
industrial output value produced by enterprises at and above 
township level in Guangdong reached 105.1 billion yuan, an 
increase of 21 percent over the same period last year; sales 
reached 96.7 billion yuan, an increase of 18 percent; exports 
reached $7.555 billion, an increase of 16.1 percent; and the 
amount of foreign funds actually used reached $2.196 billion, an 
increase of 48.8 percent. 
  Prominent problems in economic operations at present include 
a high rate of price increases, a serious shortage of working 
funds, a hidden crisis in grain production, and a lack of 
coordination between some reform measures. 
  Lu Ruihua said: The Guangdong government is soberly aware of 
the current situation, and realizes the necessity of strictly 
controlling the scale of investment while facing a stern 
monetary situation, stabilizing and developing grain production 
and preventing grain production from declining, and 
conscientiously carrying out fiscal reform and guaranteeing 
stable increases in fiscal revenue. 
  He said: Local governments at all levels in the province 
must attach great importance to keeping prices of daily 
necessities stable, strictly control the adoption of price 
reform measures without going their own way, intensify 
government control over market prices, establish food price 
regulation funds more quickly, establish a reserve system for 
major commodities, and resolutely check various practices which 
are contrary to price control regulations.

<F P=106> [By China Editor Cary Huang] </F>
  [Text] More than 70 percent of overseas-funded enterprises 
in Guangdong province have abused workers' rights or violated 
Chinese labour laws and regulations, an official survey has 
found. 
  Seventy-one of 100 foreign ventures surveyed in the province 
were found to be in breach of the labour rights protection law, 
Chinese sources quoted a provincial labour authority's report as 
saying. 
  Guangdong is home to about two-thirds of more than 200,000 
foreign-funded enterprises in China, of which about two-thirds 
are owned by Hong Kong businessmen. 
  There has been an increasing number of labour rights abuse 
cases in China recently, and the issue has become a matter of 
concern for labour authorities and trade unions. 
  The survey, by the Guangdong Provincial Labour Bureau and 
the 
Provincial Association of Trade Unions, found many company 
regulations in the foreign-funded, labour-intensive 
manufacturing sector were not in line with Chinese laws 
regarding workers' rights. 
  The report says many factory rules and disciplinary actions 
imposed by employers violated China's Enterprises Law and the 
Regulations on Award and Punishment of Enterprise Employees 
stipulated by the State Council, China's cabinet. 
  The survey of foreign-funded ventures in the Pearl River 
delta area, including Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Dongguan, and 
Baoan county, was prepared for the provincial legislature to 
devise concrete and specific regulations for the administration 
of foreign-funded ventures and for the protection of workers' 
rights. 
  The survey found that a large proportion of ventures 
required 
workers to work much longer hours than was stipulated in the law. 
  Many firms fined workers if they were found to be in 
violation of company rules. Some foreign employers required 
workers to surrender their identity cards on arrival at work and 
that cards were returned only when workers were allowed to leave 
work, having fulfilled the required work quota. 
  Some factory rules stipulated physical punishment for 
workers 
if they were found to be seriously defying factory rules. 
  "Workers are required to sign a contract that includes terms 
to accept such illegal and inhuman factory rules before they are 
hired," the report says.

  [Text] Shenzhen, 14 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- A 
responsible official of the Shenzhen Special Economic Region 
[SER] Branch of the People's Bank of China [PBC] recently 
revealed that the monetary situation in Shenzhen was stern, and 
that solutions had to be found so as to overcome difficulties. 
  The stern monetary situation was reflected primarily in 
three 
facts: First, it was very difficult to achieve the task of 
increasing bank deposits this year in Shenzhen. In the first 
two months of 1994, bank deposits of all types decreased 
sharply. Although there was a rapid rebound in March, the net 
increase in the first quarter was only 2.2 billion yuan, against 
the year's target of increasing deposits by 18 billion yuan. 
This means that deposits will have to increase by 1.8 billion 
yuan every month for the rest of the year, but Shenzhen has 
never recorded such a rate of increase. 
  Second, there was a marked outflow of funds from Shenzhen to 
other domestic areas because some large enterprises in Shenzhen 
now are expanding their operations into other domestic areas, 
and their deposits in Shenzhen are decreasing. 
  Third, the Shenzhen stock market has remained at a low level 
for a long time, and the reform of the foreign exchange 
management system and the opening of all localities in the 
country has made it hard to attract Renminbi funds into Shenzhen. 
  The bank official said that the PBC branch is trying 
actively 
and by every possible means to overcome these difficulties. The 
bank has laid down monetary control targets for various 
financial institutions. Beginning in May, the whole city will 
begin to operate according to the risk control model. This is 
an item in the in-depth reform of the banking institutions, and 
it is expected that the new mechanism will bring greater vigor 
to the banks. 
  Major breakthroughs will be made in the construction of the 
financial market in Shenzhen. The foreign exchange transfer 
center will be linked with the nationwide network. Efforts will 
be made to create conditions for putting the foreign exchange 
brokerage center and the gold trading center into operation at 
an earlier date. The construction of these markets will enhance 
Shenzhen's finance and fund-raising functions.

  [Text] The 31st provincial government executive meeting 
was convened yesterday morning [25 April]. It was presided over 
by Governor Ruan Chongwu and attended by Executive Vice Governor 
Wang Xiaofeng; Vice Governors Chen Suhou and Liu Mingqi; Liu 
Xuebin, special assistant to the governor; and government 
Secretary General Cui Zhongjun. The leaders of relevant 
provincial departments attended the meeting as guests. 
  The participants analyzed and discussed the province's 
economic situation in the first quarter of 1994. The meeting 
stated that by and large, the province's national economy grew 
steadily and normally in the first quarter of this year, with 
the province's total accumulated industrial output value 
reaching 2.089 billion yuan, representing a 3 percent increase 
over the corresponding period last year. The province's early 
wheat, tropical fruits, and aquatic products grew rapidly and 
well, and registered substantial output increases. The 
province's town and township enterprises also registered dynamic 
growth, with their output value registering a 120 percent 
increase over the same period last year. The province's 
investment structure underwent drastic readjustments, with the 
result that the province's total fixed-asset investment reached 
1.922 billion yuan, up by 68.4 percent over the same period last 
year, and the province's total investment in key projects 
reached 887 million yuan, up by 177 percent over the same period 
last year. 
  The meeting noted that since last year, the province has 
made 
unreserved efforts to develop commodity housing. As a result, 
the province's total area of commodity housing in the first 
quarter of this year registered an 81.8 percent increase over 
the corresponding period last year. In the first quarter of 
this year, the province's sales and area of commodity housing 
increased by 260 percent and 140 percent, respectively, compared 
with the corresponding period last year. The province's total 
foreign trade volume, including both import and export trade 
volumes, reached 538 million yuan, representing a 25.5 percent 
increase over the same period last year. The province's social 
commodity retail volume reached 2.249 billion yuan, up by 39 
percent over the same period last year. In the first quarter of 
this year, the province actually used a total of $1.4 billion in 
foreign funds, representing a 34.7 percent increase over the 
same period last year. Moreover, the province maintained a 
balance between revenue and expenditure, and enjoyed a basically 
stable financial situation. 
  The meeting also pinpointed a series of problems plaguing 
the 
province's economic operations, including a drastic drop in 
grain- and sugarcane-growing areas, an excessive slowdown in 
industrial growth, a rapid drop in the output value of large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, slow light industrial 
growth, a slight drop in export volume, and a sustained shortage 
of funds, as well as a drastic drop in revenue and soaring 
prices on the part of some cities and counties. 
  The meeting held that the province's difficulties have 
resulted from a multitude of contradictions. Given the current 
nationwide macroeconomic retrenchment, the province should make 
more energetic efforts to press ahead with all sorts of reforms, 
optimize the economic structure, raise economic efficiency, and 
maintain sustained economic growth in hopes of eventually 
bringing the province's economy back into a benign cycle. 
  The meeting emphatically called for enhancing the province's 
economic work in the months ahead by improving macroeconomic 
supervision and control; speeding up readjustment of the 
industrial structural and the product mix; further developing 
production; bringing about sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic growth; increasing effective investment in both 
agriculture and the construction of key projects; guaranteeing 
sufficient funds for the production of readily marketable 
products; continually and vigorously quickening the pace of 
reforms; stepping up price control and market building; and 
energetically improving the investment environment.

<F P=106> [By reporter Gu Shihong (7357 2514 1347): "Hainan </F>
Implements Preferential Policies for Exit and Entry on Personal 
Reasons"] 
  [Text] Haikou, 8 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- This reporter 
learned from today's news briefing by the Hainan Provincial 
Public Security Department that, as ordered by the Ministry of 
Public Security, Hainan Province had implemented a series of 
preferential exit and entry policies. 
  Peng Xiaomin, of the Exit and Entry Administrative Section 
of 
the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department, said that the 
policy toward exit and entry for personal reasons--which are 
more preferential than those of other localities in China--are 
as follows: 
  First, the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department can 
issue visas directly to Taiwan residents upon arrival at the 
Haikou and Sanya ports. In accordance with the policy of 
"issuing visas on landing," Taiwan residents need not go through 
any formalities before they come to Hainan. With valid 
documents, they can fly from Taiwan to Hong Kong, change planes 
there, and come to Hainan. In addition, if compatriots from 
Taiwan wish to go to any open city on the mainland, but do not 
want to stay in Hong Kong or Macao to go through formalities, 
they also can come to Hainan first, obtain an "Entry and Exit 
Permit for Taiwan Resident Visiting the Mainland," then take a 
plane from Hainan to the hinterland. They can leave the 
mainland via any open port and without restriction. The Exit 
and Entry Administrative Section of the Hainan Provincial Public 
Security Department has set up visa offices at the airports and 
wharves of the Haikou and Sanya ports where incoming compatriots 
from Taiwan can obtain an "Entry and Exit Permit for Taiwan 
Resident Visiting the Mainland" immediately after showing valid 
documents, filling in a form, and submitting two photos. The 
formalities are very simple. 
  Second, it will not only be easy to enter Hainan, but 
convenient to leave it as well. In accordance with Hainan's 
policy on formalities connected with the "Application for Exit 
Permit With a Certificate of Temporary Residence"--which has 
been approved by the Ministry of Public Security--working 
personnel who have lived in Hainan for more than six months and 
who have registered their residence outside Hainan may apply in 
Hainan for travel documents to visit other countries and Hong 
Kong. Working personnel who have lived in Hainan for more than 
one year not only can travel to other countries, but also can 
apply for passports for personal reasons, such as work, visits 
to relatives and friends, or for training abroad. In 
particular, Chinese citizens can go by sea to Vietnam following 
the Sanya-Da Nang sea route, and foreigners and compatriots from 
Taiwan can come directly from Vietnam to Hainan. It is said 
that this is China's only exit and entry sea link with Vietnam. 
  In addition, the Ministry of Public Security and the Hong 
Kong Immigration Department have agreed that beginning 1 January 
this year, the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department may 
issue "Multiple Entry and Exit Permit for Visitors to Hong Kong 
and Macao" for personal reasons. This will be convenient for 
individuals engaged in trade, economic, and science and 
technology activities in Hainan who want to go to Hong Kong. 
  The statistics indicate that the number of foreigners who 
came to Hainan for a short stay last year amounted to 22,887 -- 
an increase of 5.8 percent over the previous year. Last year, 
the number of Taiwan residents who came to Haikou by plane or by 
sea directly from Taiwan via Hong Kong amounted to 4,348.

  [Excerpts] On the morning of 29 April, the provincial 
party committee and government held a meeting on coal 
production. Provincial party Secretary Li Changchun; Vice 
Governor Fan Qinchen, member of the provincial party committee 
standing committee; and Vice Governor Yu Jiahua; as well as 
responsible comrades of the relevant departments directly under 
provincial authorities; worked together to make an in-depth 
analysis of the difficulties facing coal industry, and ways to 
overcome these difficulties and to turn the corner. 
  Li Changchun pointed out that the basic solution to coal 
industry lies in emancipating our minds, changing our ideass, 
deepening the reform, and establishing the socialist market 
economy system as early as possible. Coal was one of the 
industries that followed the planned economy system rigidly. It 
also is one of those industries facing great difficulties in its 
transition to the socialist market economy system. Therefore, 
it is necessary for us to emancipate our minds as early as 
possible, change our ideas, and study well the theory of the 
socialist market economy by combining theory with practice to 
accelerate the pace of reform. [passage omitted including 
indistinct portion] 
  Li Changchun stressed: At present, we must do well the work 
of stabilizing enterprises that face difficulties. Enterprise 
party organizations at all levels must truly play their key 
role, and communist party members must play their vanguard and 
exemplary role to unite with and guide workers and staff members 
to deepen reforms, and overcome difficulties. They must pay 
attention to solving practical problems for the masses. They 
must show consideration for workers and staff members who have 
difficulties. Some workers and staff members may have 
complaints about certain problems; for the moment, however, 
these problems cannot be solved under the present conditions. 
We must talk to them patiently so as to bring them around. 
  Li Changchun urged relevant quarters to show concern for and 
support the coal industry. Local governments at all levels must 
bring diversified operations of coal industry into their plans, 
and actively support them. Li Changchun hoped that the coal 
industry, after exerting its efforts for several years, would 
succeed in putting an end to the passive state of affairs, take 
on a benign cycle, and become an important new force for 
invigorating Henan.

<F P=106> [Hubei Provincial Government Work Report Delivered by Hubei </F>
Governor Jia Zhijie Before the Second Session of the Eighth 
Provincial People's Congress on 26 February: "Government Work 
Report"] 
  [Text] Fellow Deputies: 
  On behalf of the provincial people's government, I now 
submit 
the report on the work of the government for your examination 
and approval, and also for suggestions and comments from members 
of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and other observers. 
<H5>  I. A Review of Our Work in 1993 </H5>
  The year 1993 was one in which this session of the 
provincial 
government started its work, and also one in which the people of 
the entire province strived to overfulfill tasks for national 
economic development and advanced on the road of building 
socialism with the Chinese characteristics. During the year, 
under the leadership of the provincial party committee and with 
the supervision and support of the provincial people's congress 
and the provincial CPPCC, we conscientiously implemented the 
spirit of the 14th party congress, put into practice all major 
policy decisions made by the central authorities on 
strengthening macroeconomic control and regulation in the light 
of Hubei's realistic conditions, constantly deepened reform, 
expanded the scale of opening up, seized favorable 
opportunities, accelerated development, and attained encouraging 
new achievements in reform, opening up, and the modernization 
drive. The province's GDP was 108.1 billion yuan, representing a 
record increase for the past eight years of 12.7 percent; the 
total industrial and agricultural output value stood at 213.2 
billion yuan, an increase of 17.8 percent; and financial revenue 
amounted to 11.47 billion yuan, a 21.8-percent increase. The 
per capita income used by urban dwellers for living expenses was 
2,191 yuan, up by 516 yuan; while the per capita net income of 
peasants increased by 105 yuan to 783 yuan. Our targets of 
"three surpasses and one enhancement" set at the beginning of 
the year were all fulfilled. A review of our work of the past 
year shows that we focused our attention on the following major 
issues, which has successfully brought along the development of 
the whole province: 
  1. Vigorous efforts made on structural readjustment 
helped enhance economic development and efficiency. To 
achieve the goal of high yield, fine quality, and high 
efficiency, the agricultural sector stepped up the intensity of 
structural readjustment. As a result, the production of grain, 
cotton and cooking oil remained basically stable, while the 
development of the diversified economy was clearly expedited. 
The total agricultural output value for the year reached 46.7 
billion yuan, up by 6.7 percent, of which the output value of 
the nonfarming sectors was up by 4 percentage points, accounting 
for 39.7 percent of the total agricultural output value. New 
strides were taken in readjusting the industrial product mix and 
the enterprise structure. Our plan for new product development 
was fulfilled in a comprehensive way, and 800 enterprises 
adopted the share-holding system. The industrial output value 
for the year amounted to 166.5 billion yuan, up by 21.3 percent. 
The investment structure was further optimized. The 
fixed-asset investment for the year stood at 34.88 billion yuan, 
up by 44.9 percent, while investment in agriculture, energy, 
transport, and telecommunications went up steadily. 
  2. Close attention was paid to the development of 
township and town enterprises and the development of the 
individual and private economies, and major breakthroughs were 
made in cultivating new economic growth points. The 
provincial party committee and government called separate 
meetings on the work of township and town enterprises and the 
work of the individual and private economies with a view to 
improving and perfecting policies in these fields. A campaign 
of emulating, learning from, catching up with, helping and in 
turn surpassing each other was set off in all localities, giving 
a great impetus to the development of township and town 
enterprises and the development of the individual and private 
economies. The total output value of the province's township 
and town enterprises reached 90.8 billion yuan, while the sales 
volume of the individual and private economies totaled 13.82 
billion yuan, up by 68.8 and 71.1 percent respectively. 
  3. Efforts were made to step up the development of 
energy, communications, and other basic industries and 
facilities, thus easing "bottleneck restrictions" to a certain 
extent. Encouraged by the provincial meeting on the power 
industry, all localities tried to pool funds to accelerate power 
construction. During the year, generating capacity increased by 
1.45 million kw, thus easing the tightness of supply of 
electricity. Basic transportation facilities were being 
constantly improved and special attention was paid to the 
construction of a number of projects, including the Yihuang 
Highway, the Wuhan Tianhe Airport, the Chang Jiang Highway 
Bridge, and Enshi Airport. 
  4. We seized the favorable opportunity of opening up 
the Chang Jiang to the outside world, and further expanded and 
deepened opening up. With the implementation of the 
state's strategy on opening up and developing the Chang Jiang, 
more foreign investors began to show interest in Hubei. In 
order to seize this favorable opportunity, the provincial 
government successfully held a large-scale economic and trade 
fair in Hong Kong, at which a large number of contracts on 
cooperative projects were signed. Meanwhile, large-scale 
activities aimed at attracting foreign investment were also 
carried out in all localities, thus opening up a new situation 
in Hubei's introduction of foreign investment. Cities like 
Wuhan and Yichang in particular have become hot investment spots 
for major companies and financial groups based in foreign 
countries as well as in Hong Kong and Macao. The number of 
newly approved foreign- invested enterprises across the province 
was 2,188, 943 more than the previous year. The total 
investment amount entailed by all projects stood at $4.84 
billion, up by 190 percent, of which foreign investment totaled 
$1.94 billion, with $530 million already put into use, 
registering a 160-percent increase. Remarkable results were 
attained in foreign trade and export. The total export volume 
reached $1.686 billion, representing an increase of 22 percent. 
  5. Strides were taken to implement major policy 
decisions of the central authorities on strengthening 
macroeconomic control and regulation in the light of Hubei's 
realistic conditions, thus ensuring normal national economic 
operation. Shortly after the central authorities issued 
the No. 6 Document, the provincial party and government promptly 
called a provincial meeting on financial and monetary work, at 
which the guiding principle of two "unswervings" was defined and 
a "Suggestion on Implementation of the No. 6 Document of the 
Central Authorities to Improve and Strengthen Macroeconomic 
Control and Regulation" was issued. As a result, the arbitrary 
practices of granting loans, raising funds, and establishing 
monetary institutions were effectively stopped. With a view to 
making flexible use of capital which was already in short supply 
and attaining greater progress under difficult situations, 
governments and monetary departments at all levels worked in 
close coordination, strengthened the collection and regulation 
of funds, satisfied the demands for purchasing agricultural 
products, and put an end to the practice of issuing IOUs. 
Remarkable results were attained in mobilizing the masses to 
deposit more savings in banks. By the end of December, the 
savings deposits balance across the province reached 79.852 
billion yuan, an increase of 18.042 billion yuan over the same 
period of the previous year, of which the savings deposits newly 
added during a four-month period from August to December 
accounted for 56 percent of the total, registering an increase 
of 6.573 billion yuan over the same period of the previous year. 
The year-end loans balance was 116.261 billion yuan, 17.9 
billion yuan more than the end of the previous year. 
  6. A well-coordinated development was brought to the 
economy and social undertakings, and the living standards of the 
people were further improved. Great headway was made in 
applying scientific and technological achievements to economic 
development. Of the province's 550 scientific and technological 
achievements at the provincial level and above, 39 were given 
national awards and the utilization rate stood at 80 percent. 
Education developed in a comprehensive way. Elementary 
education was further stepped up, while vocational and higher 
education constantly improved. Sports were further developed. 
Nine athletes from Hubei won world championships at 
international meets during the year, while another three broke 
world records on six occasions. Progress was also registered in 
the fields of literature and art; the press and publishing; 
radio, film and television; the social sciences; public health; 
family planning; and environmental protection. Alongside the 
development of our economy, markets flourished, enjoying brisk 
buying and selling. The volume of retail sales for the year 
amounted to 55.654 billion yuan, registering an increase of 21.1 
percent. 
  7. Simultaneous attention was paid to "two types of 
work" with a view to reinforcing the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization, socialist democracy, and the legal 
system. Education was carried out in depth on the party's 
basic line, patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; while 
activities were launched with the aim of cultivating new 
practices in trades, emulating Lei Feng at various working 
posts, and building "two civilizations" units as well as 
civilized households. As a result, the ideological and ethical 
qualities of the vast numbers of masses were enhanced. Through 
their study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" 
in particular, the people of the entire province further 
strengthened their consciousness and confidence in taking the 
road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Governments at all levels submitted regular work reports to the 
standing committee of the provincial people's congress, briefed 
the provincial CPPCC on recent developments, solicited opinions 
of all sides on major issues, and thus further reinforced 
democratic supervision and decisionmaking procedures. The 
campaign of "cracking down on crime" continued. Heavy 
punishments were swiftly handed down to a number of major 
criminals according to the law, thus bringing a favorable turn 
to social order. Strides were made in lightening the heavy 
burden of peasants and protecting their legitimate interests and 
rights. The anticorruption struggle was carried out in depth, 
and a number of large and serious cases were cracked, bringing 
about new breakthroughs in the building of clean government. 
  Fellow Deputies, 
  We attained tremendous accomplishments last year. It is the 
people of all nationalities of our province who, through their 
hard work and concerted efforts, have made all these 
achievements possible. On behalf of the provincial people's 
government, I wish to express heartfelt gratitude to the vast 
numbers of cadres and masses working on all fronts across the 
province as well as to the officers and men of the People's 
Liberation Army and the Armed Police stationed in Hubei. I also 
wish to express our sincere thanks to our compatriots in Taiwan, 
Hong Kong and Macao and those residing abroad and to all our 
international friends who care about and support Hubei's 
construction! 
  While affirming our achievements, we must also recognize 
with a sober mind that there have been failings and mistakes in 
the work of the government and that there are still problems and 
difficulties in our way ahead. These are chiefly the following: 
Capital supply and demand remain imbalanced, and a considerable 
number of medium-sized and small enterprises are faced with 
great difficulties in their operation and plagued by heavy 
losses; commodity prices have increased by a large margin, 
making life more difficult for workers in enterprises in which 
production has been totally or partially suspended, and also for 
peasants in certain mountain areas; social order was not as good 
as expected; the situation in family planning still remains 
grim; and corrupt practices, formalism, and bureaucracy existing 
among a minority of state workers have impaired the close ties 
between the government and the masses. We need to pay close 
attention to and to adopt effective measures to solve all these 
problems. In reviewing our work in the past year, we believe 
that earnest efforts need to be made in the following fields 
this year in order to consolidate and develop the present sound 
situation in reform and opening up: 
  First, to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy, it is imperative to regard 
development as the last word. At present, Hubei is enjoying 
favorable opportunities and conditions for further development. 
We must seize these favorable opportunities and go all out to 
accelerate economic development. We should give vigorous 
support to those localities which have the conditions to speed 
up construction and which have the capability to expedite 
construction through arduous efforts. With a view to creating a 
sound social environment wherein development is justified and 
commendable, a policy should be adopted toward localities, 
enterprises, and individuals of remuneration for their 
outstanding contributions to economic development, thus giving 
form to a unifying force in our effort to speed up economic 
reform. 
  Second, it is necessary to continuously deepen reform 
and expand opening up, and bring about a faster and better 
development of the economy. Since reform and opening up 
are a strong motive force to push forward economic development, 
we need to step up the intensity of reform, and rely on reform 
to bring along the whole situation. We must integrate economic 
development with reform and opening up in an organic way, focus 
our efforts on reinvigorating state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises, deepen reform in all sectors, speed up the 
development pace of an export-oriented economy, and inject 
greater vigor into our economy. 
  Third, we must put the enhancement of economic 
efficiency in first place, and seek unity between speed, 
efficiency, and development potential. We must put an end 
to practices such as blindly seeking high output values, 
engaging in overlapping construction of poor quality, and 
extensive management; exert great efforts to optimize the 
economic structure, push forward technological progress, and 
improve operational management; and regard, in real terms, the 
enhancement of economic efficiency as the focus of our economic 
development. 
  Fourth, we must correctly handle relations between 
reform, development, and social stability. Reform is a 
motive force of development while development is the goal, and 
social stability is the prerequisite for both. 
  Under the present situation wherein reform is intensified 
and 
development accelerated, we must take into consideration the 
endurance capacity of all social sectors, and correctly handle 
relations between reform, development, and social stability. We 
should not stress stability to the neglect of reform and 
development, nor can we only emphasize reform and development to 
the neglect of social stability. What we should do is integrate 
the three in an organic way and make them complementary to each 
other. 
  Fifth, we should "pay simultaneous attention to two 
types of work," attaching equal importance to both. 
Efforts to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization, 
socialist democracy, and the legal system with a view to 
maintaining political and social stability are a fundamental 
guarantee for pushing forward the building of material 
civilization. To ensure smooth progress in all fields of 
endeavor, we should unswervingly pay simultaneous attention to 
the building of material and spiritual civilization, attaching 
equal importance to reform and opening up on the one hand and to 
the building of clean government and the crackdown on all crime 
on the other. 
<H5>  II. The Goal of Struggle and Major Tasks in Economic </H5>
Development in 1994 
  The year 1994 is vital not only to Hubei's plan to push the 
national economy onto the first new step in the nineties, but 
also to our efforts to promote reform. At present, our province 
is enjoying favorable opportunities and a sound situation for 
further development. The national economy has joined an 
"express line" of development; following Wuhan and Huangshi, 
Yichang has become another open city, thus bringing a major 
change to the overall setup of opening up; and preparations for 
the Three Gorges project are well under way. Meanwhile, the 
state has readjusted the setup of the automobile industry and 
speeded up the 10-million-tonne transformation of the Wuhan Iron 
and Steel Plant, thus providing us with more new opportunities. 
In fact, Hubei has been pushed to the forefront of reform and 
opening up in the central and western regions. The development 
of the situation has set objective requirements for Hubei to 
speed up its reform and construction and to play a greater role 
in the country's overall economic setup. The whole province 
should have a greater sense of historical responsibility and 
mission as well as the sense of urgency in accelerating reform; 
seize the present favorable opportunities; step up the intensity 
of reform, opening up, development, and implementation; and 
attain greater accomplishments in the new year. The 
following is the general guiding ideology for our future 
economic work: We should unswervingly follow the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as well as the party's basic line, 
conscientiously implement the spirits of the 14th party congress 
and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
act in accordance with the requirements raised by the sixth 
provincial party congress, seize the present favorable 
opportunities, expand the scale of opening up, consolidate the 
basic position of agriculture, bring into full play the pillar 
role of large and medium-sized enterprises, pay close attention 
to major economic growth points, do a good job in strengthening 
such weak links as the light and textile industries, step up the 
building of infrastructural facilities and basic industries, 
promote scientific and technological progress and carry out 
structural readjustment, strive to enhance the efficiency and 
quality of the economy, and bring about a sustained, high-speed, 
and healthy development to Hubei's national economy. The 
overall goal of struggle is to "overfulfill plans, catch up with 
other parts of China, mount a new step, and bring about new 
breakthroughs to all industries and trades." In other 
words, Hubei should overfulfill one year ahead of schedule all 
tasks set out in the Eighth Five-Year Plan, strive to keep pace 
with the country's average national economic growth rate, and 
successfully mount its first new step in the nineties. The 
following are some major targets for this year's national 
economic development: GDP is expected to reach 118.4 billion 
yuan, up by 9.5 percent, of which primary industry will gain an 
increase of 5 percent; secondary industry, 12 percent, and 
tertiary industry, 11 percent. The total industrial and 
agricultural output value is forecast to be 241 billion yuan, 
registering a 13.1-percent increase; and total financial revenue 
to be 13.1 billion, up by 8.84 percent if calculated in terms of 
comparable items. The income of workers and staff in 
state-owned enterprises and the per capita net income of 
peasants are expected to increase by 15 percent and 100 yuan 
respectively. The total volume of retail sales will be 
controlled at below the country's average level. 
  To fulfill or overfulfill this year's tasks of national 
economic development, we must break with conventional practices, 
work out new ideas and adopt new measures, and bring about new 
breakthroughs. First of all, we need to have new ideas in 
developing our economy. Fundamentally speaking, this means that 
we should transform the economic operation from extensive 
management to intensive management, and open up a development 
road characterized by less input, more output, good quality, 
high efficiency, and fast accumulation. Second, we need to make 
new breakthroughs in policies. The most urgent task for the 
time being is, in line with the usual practices of the market 
economy, to promptly work out a number of concrete policies and 
methods on enlivening the economy; and to give a free hand to 
and encourage grass-roots units, enterprises, and the masses to 
try their best to boost the economy. Third, new moves and 
measures should be taken in our work. That is to say, we need 
to accomplish a number of major tasks in order to bring along 
the whole situation, and to base the high-speed economic 
development on a solid foundation. The focus of this year's 
economic work is to grasp one key issue, bring about five 
large- scale breakthroughs, start three major motivation 
projects, and alleviate four conspicuous contradictions. 
This means that we should focus our efforts on state-owned large 
and medium-sized enterprises; bring about breakthroughs in the 
development of the diversified economy, township and town 
enterprises, tertiary industry, the individual and private 
economies, and the export-oriented economy; start as soon as 
possible a number of major projects, including the 1-million 
vehicle project, the 10-million-tonne steel transformation 
project of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, as well as auxiliary 
projects serving the Three Gorges project; and ease the tight 
supply of capital and remove bottleneck restrictions in the 
fields of energy, transportation, and telecommunications. 
  In line with the above goals of struggle and development 
plans, our economic work this year will be focused mainly on the 
following issues: 
  1. With the aim of increasing the income of peasants, 
we should stabilize the production of grain, cotton, and cooking 
oil; bring about breakthroughs in the development of a 
diversified economy and the development of township and town 
enterprises; and enliven the rural economy in a comprehensive 
way. 
  Since agriculture has the power to bring great order across 
the land, we need to put agriculture in a primary position in 
our economic work. This year's total grain and cotton outputs 
are expected to reach 23.5 million and 500,000 tonnes 
respectively. The total agricultural value is forecast to be 
49.5 billion yuan, representing an increase of 6 percent. In 
view of market demand, we will make vigorous efforts to boost 
the production of fine-quality grain and cotton, as well as side 
crops in high demand, such as soya beans and corn; and continue 
to guide agriculture along the development road characterized by 
high yields, fine quality, and high efficiency. Continued 
efforts will be made to build a number of counties into major 
production bases of commodity grain and cotton, as well as to 
set up agricultural demonstration zones of "two highs and one 
excellence"; to open up more "grain fields with a yield of one 
tonne per mu," "cotton fields with a yield of 200 kg per mu," 
and "farm fields which can produce an output value of 1,000 yuan 
per mu"; to vigorously spread the use of high-yielding and 
highly efficient crop-raising patterns; and to enhance the 
plantation efficiency of grain and cotton. We will 
conscientiously implement the series of preferential policies 
extended to agriculture by the party, protect the enthusiasm of 
peasants in production, firmly establish the concept of fighting 
natural disasters and striving for harvests, make careful 
preparations for the prevention and control of all kinds of 
natural disasters, and strive to reap an overall agricultural 
harvest this year. 
  Breakthroughs should be made in the development of a 
diversified economy, for it is a fundamental way for peasants to 
increase their income, to get rich, and to lead a fairly 
comfortable life. Efforts will be made to increase the output 
value of diversifying operations to 31 billion yuan, accounting 
for over 62 percent of the total agricultural output value; and 
to increase the per capita net income of peasants from 
diversification by more than 60 yuan. We will bring into full 
play Hubei's advantages in mountain and water resources; focus 
our efforts on cultivating pillar industries; and accelerate the 
production of products in high demand in both the domestic and 
overseas markets, including livestock and poultry, aquatic 
products, tea, mulberries, Chinese medicinal herbs, and fruits. 
Continued efforts will be made to tap the potential of the 
aquatic industry and gain a newly increased output value of 1 
billion yuan, which makes up 10 percent of the total 
agricultural output value. It is necessary to expedite the 
development of animal husbandry, forestry, fruits, and special 
local products; and turn them into highly competitive sectors in 
the shortest possible time. All localities should act in the 
light of local conditions, increase input in agriculture, set up 
production bases which can make use of local natural resources, 
step up the processing industry in light of market demand, 
develop a number of pillar industries and fist products, and 
gradually achieve the goal of every township and village having 
its own highly competitive industry or product. Mountain areas 
are required to successfully put into effect the practice 
whereby each person is responsible for one mu of cash forest. 
We should take further steps to motivate the enthusiasm of all 
rural households in developing a diversified economy, expand the 
scale of the courtyard economy, enhance the development level, 
and engage ourselves in running green enterprises. 
  It is imperative to make breakthroughs in the development of 
township and town enterprises by reinforcing relevant measures. 
This year's output value of township and town enterprises is 
forecast to be 125 billion yuan, registering an increase of 37.7 
percent. We should implement in a thoroughgoing way all 
preferential policies which are designed to support the 
development of township and town enterprises, continue to 
increase input in such enterprises, raise funds through various 
channels, and strive to input an additional amount of 4.5 
billion yuan into township and town enterprises this year. 
Vigorous efforts will be made to acquire the state's 
special-purpose loans earmarked for the development of township 
and town enterprises in central and western regions. We will 
continue to implement the policy of providing support in terms 
of working capital and loans at discount interest, and give a 
stronger backing to those township and town enterprises which 
enjoy "three highs" and which are engaged in earning foreign 
exchange through exports and producing substitutes for imported 
goods. Efforts will be accelerated to set up master files for 
projects carried out by township and town enterprises, as well 
as for highly competitive products; to attract more foreign 
investment; and to enhance the grade and level of township and 
town enterprises. It is necessary to continue deepening the 
reform of township and town enterprises; vigorously develop 
share-holding cooperative enterprises; facilitate the 
integration of trade, industry, and agriculture; strengthen 
enterprise management; and enhance the economic efficiency of 
enterprises. This year, we plan to give form to a number of new 
enterprises which enjoy an output value of 1 billion yuan, 
organize a number of enterprise groups, build a number of small 
industrial zones, and develop a number of leading enterprises in 
agricultural and sideline production. Strides will be made in 
closely integrating the development of township and town 
enterprises with urban construction with a view to speeding up 
the process of urbanization of rural areas. 
  It is imperative to pay simultaneous attention to the 
practice of selecting the best qualified and to the work of 
giving assistance to the poor, and to successfully fulfill the 
"eight-seven" aid-the-poor campaign [a national campaign aimed 
at giving great support to poor areas, especially old 
revolutionary areas, areas inhabited by minority nationalities, 
and remote border areas; helping them extricate themselves from 
poverty and get rich; and providing 80 million people across the 
country with sufficient food and clothing within the seven years 
from the present to the year 2000]. We will conscientiously 
carry out all preferential policies designed to support the 
development of poor areas, continue doing a good job of the 
project of "providing sufficient food and clothing," help poor 
areas develop a diversified economy, and assist them in finding 
more ways to get rich. Meanwhile, we will also encourage all 
sectors of society to give unit-to-unit support to key areas, 
thus accelerating the pace of poor areas extricating themselves 
from poverty and getting rich. 
  2. A high-speed growth will be maintained in 
industrial production on the basis of enhancing efficiency. 
  This year's provincial industrial output value is planned to 
grow by 15 percent, with a production to sales rate of over 95 
percent. To fulfill this arduous task, we must adopt powerful 
and effective measures to ensure a high-speed industrial growth. 
  First, we should exert great efforts to run well state-owned 
large and medium-sized enterprises. Because Hubei's stable 
economic growth mainly relies on large and medium-sized 
enterprises, we must regard the work of running well state-owned 
large and medium-sized enterprises as the central issue of this 
year's work: 1) Preferential measures will be adopted in 
capital supply to satisfy the rational needs of large and 
medium-sized enterprises in production and operation; 2) we will 
step up the intensity of reform and enliven various kinds of 
enterprises in different sectors. We are planning to revitalize 
enterprises by transforming them into share-holding cooperative 
enterprises and by shifting their production to tertiary 
industry, or through introduction of foreign funds, organization 
of enterprise groups, and leases and auctions; 3) with the aim 
of lightening the burden of enterprises, all their irrational 
burdens should be thoroughly screened. Efforts will be made to 
absolutely reduce the irrational burdens of enterprises, thus 
creating a sound external environment for enterprises. 
  Second, with a view to expanding the operational scale, we 
will accelerate the building of the "giant project." To enable 
key means of production to flow toward highly competitive 
industries, enterprises, and products, we will mainly rely on 
large and medium-sized enterprises, on joint property rights, 
and on readjustment of product mix to integrate technological 
transformation and development with enterprise reform; 
accelerate the development of a large number of economically 
strong major enterprises, companies, and groups; and greatly 
enhance the level of Hubei's scale operation and improve its 
competitiveness as a whole. This year, while continuing to 
consolidate and improving existing enterprise groups, we will 
step up our efforts to organize a number of large and 
medium-sized enterprise groups which have output values 
exceeding 500 million, 1 billion, and 1.5 billion yuan. We will 
unremittingly carry out a product strategy, continue to do a 
good job in the development of both 100 key products and 4,000 
new products, and strive to push the fund rate of output value 
of new products to 13 percent. 
  Third, we will intensify technological transformation, and 
rejuvenate the light and textile industries. At present, with 
relatively large stocks and a large number of employees, the 
light and textile industries are generally plagued by outdated 
equipment, backward technologies, products of inferior quality, 
and poor competitiveness. In view of this situation, we must 
regard the transformation of the light and textile industries as 
a major issue in our efforts to save enterprises, stabilize 
society, and bring into play Hubei's advantages in stocks. 
Through updating and upgrading the light and textile 
industries, we can successfully bring improvement to and enliven 
industry. This year, we should put the focus of technological 
transformation on motivation for the "plan to rejuvenate the 
light and textile industries" and, based on highly competitive 
products, select a number of state-owned enterprises to carry 
out technological transformation with a high starting point. 
The provincial authorities have decided to raise funds, 
totaling 1 billion yuan, to set up a foundation for the 
rejuvenation of the light and textile industries within this 
year. All localities are also required to squeeze out more 
technological transformation funds to step up the intensity of 
transformation of the light and textile industries. 
  Fourth, we will pay close attention to newly started major 
development projects with the aim of bringing about a sustained 
growth in the industrial economy. For a certain period in the 
future, we will focus our efforts on the following major 
projects which can bring along the whole situation: We should 
seize the favorable opportunity as the state is readjusting the 
setup of and issuing policies on the automobile industry, and 
rely on the Dongfeng Automobile Company to accelerate the 
development of Hubei's automobile industry, striving to turn 
Hubei within the coming decade into a major automobile-producing 
province with an annual output of 1 million automobiles; based 
on the "10-million-tonne" transformation project of the Wuhan 
Iron and Steel Plant, we will promote joint operation and 
cooperation among iron and steel plants within the province with 
a view to building Hubei into a first-class major 
steel-producing province; seizing opportunities provided by the 
Three Gorges project, we plan to vigorously develop industries 
as well as products related to the project, and bring about 
greater development to a number of related industries, including 
metallurgy, machinery, and building materials. 
  Fifth, it is imperative to reinforce the management and 
enhance the economic efficiency of enterprises. Based on the 
implementation of the "Law on Product Quality," we will 
reinforce the basic management of enterprises in a comprehensive 
way. Activities aimed at "transforming the mechanism, paying 
attention to management, improving internal training, and 
enhancing efficiency" will be launched in all industrial 
enterprises, with a view to enabling enterprises to concentrate 
their attention on their own operation and development; to 
improving their economic results; to attaching equal importance 
to strengthening management and to making up deficits and 
increasing profits; and to striving to reduce the number of 
loss-making enterprises and the total amount of losses by 10 and 
15 percent respectively within this year. 
  3. Efforts will be made to step up the intensity of 
investment, optimize the investment pattern, and pay close 
attention to key construction. 
  This year, Hubei's society-wide fixed-asset investment will 
be 45 billion yuan, an increase of 29 percent; while the 
investment rate will stand at 30 percent. To optimize the 
structure of fixed-asset investment, we will increase input into 
technological transformation; use a small increment to 
revitalize a huge stock; and strive, through several years of 
hard work, to bring about a fundamental change to the 
technological quality of Hubei's traditional pillar industries, 
such as the light and textile industries as well as the 
engineering industry. The focus of basic construction is to 
continue reinforcing the building of basic industries and 
facilities, including agriculture, energy, transportation, and 
telecommunications; give full support to the Three Gorges 
project and do a good job in the resettlement of residents in 
the dam area; pay close attention to the implementation of 21 
major system projects; and strive to start 54 and complete or 
initially complete 19 projects within this year. To step up the 
intensity of investment, we must try to raise funds through 
various channels. We should seize the present opportunity as 
the state is reforming its investment and fund-raising 
structure; help large and medium-sized projects prepare for 
state investment which the state earlier promised to inject; and 
make first-phase preparations for construction projects which 
plan to acquire state investment. We will try to introduce more 
direct foreign funds for such large-scale projects as the Second 
Phase of the Hanchuan Power Plant, the Huanglongshi Airport, the 
Yihuang Highway, the Fufa Glassware Plant, and the 400,000-tonne 
wax-splitting project; try hard to issue 1.3 billion yuan worth 
of securities in Hubei, a task assigned by the state; and 
earnestly work out measures to ensure the auxiliary supply of 
local funds for key projects. 
  4. Breakthroughs need to be made in the development 
of tertiary industry, thus giving shape to a new setup of 
industrial growth. 
  The stagnant development of Hubei's tertiary industry is a 
major factor restricting the economic development of the 
province; on the other hand, it is also a field in which we can 
tap potentials to accelerate economic development. Therefore, we 
must adopt effective measures, and strive to bring about 
breakthroughs in the development of tertiary industry. We 
should focus our efforts on the development of industries and 
trades which need less investment, enjoy faster returns and 
better efficiency, have a capacity for absorbing more labor 
power, and are closely linked with economic development and the 
livelihood of the people. Moreover, we will also speed up the 
development of such industries as commercial services, monetary 
information, communications and telecommunications, real estate, 
and tourism. Further steps will be taken to make more flexible 
use of policies. The examination and approval system will be 
turned into a registration system, and all social sectors will 
be urged to make greater investment in and run tertiary 
industries in various ways. Meanwhile, we should encourage 
governmental workers as well as surplus staff of enterprises, 
who are the subject of reductions during structural 
readjustments, to engage themselves in tertiary industries; 
encourage enterprises of tertiary industries to merge with 
industrial enterprises which are closing down; support 
industrial enterprises in running tertiary industries; 
accelerate the development of the first batch of tertiary 
industrial groups; further relax control over tertiary industry 
prices, grant more loans to tertiary industries, and extend 
preferential policies to newly established tertiary industries. 
  Breakthroughs need to be made in the development of the 
individual and private economies, for they constitute a major 
force for the development of tertiary industry. We will 
conscientiously carry out the decision of the provincial party 
and government on accelerating the development of the individual 
and private economies, and take more steps to mobilize the 
enthusiasm of all sides in bringing about further development. 
This year, we will strive to reach the development goal of 
"taking three big strides in three years" one year ahead of 
schedule, pushing the total sales volume of the individual and 
private economies to 30 billion yuan and the total number of 
persons engaged to 2 million. 
  5. Efforts will be focused on key issues so as to 
speed up the pace of market building. 
  To develop a socialist market economy, we need to have a 
perfect market system and smooth circulation channels. We 
should act in accordance with the requirements for the building 
of general markets and circulation; continue to set up and 
perfect more marketing and circulation networks; and focus our 
efforts on building, in major agricultural production zones as 
well as in large and medium-sized cities, a number of markets 
for bulk agricultural products and wholesale markets for means 
of production which enjoy effective functions and have an 
influence on the entire country. We will try to set up grain 
and cotton futures trading markets in Wuhan; a number of 
large-scale trading markets for means of production, mainly 
steel sheets, automobiles, and cement, in places like Wuhan, 
Huangshi, Ezhou, Shiyan, and Xiangfan; and a number of border 
trade markets in border townships and towns including Jinzhou, 
Enshi, Yunyang, Xiangfan, Huanggang, and Xianning. 
  It is imperative to accelerate the cultivation of the 
monetary market, and gradually build Hubei into a regional 
monetary center. While continuing to expand the operational 
scale of banks and to open more banking credit businesses, we 
will expedite the development of trusted investment companies, 
professional insurance companies, and urban and rural 
cooperative banks; try to persuade three newly organized state 
policy banks to set up representative offices in Hubei; try to 
organize and build Hubei's own regional development bank; expand 
international monetary business and try to have more overseas 
and foreign monetary institutions set up monetary organs in 
cities such as Wuhan; expand the trading scale of all kinds of 
securities, and support large enterprises, including the Dongqi 
Company, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Plant, and the Geheyan Power 
Station, in listing in stock exchanges to raise funds in huge 
amounts; and try to have the state set up a securities exchange 
in Wuhan as soon as possible so that Hubei can become a 
securities exchange center and a "pool" for capital in the 
central and western regions. 
  Vigorous efforts will be made to develop the labor, 
personnel, and technology markets with a view to rationalizing 
the circulation and optimizing the allocation of means of 
production. We will allow non-labor departments to set up labor 
markets, accelerate the establishment of a number of 
standardized and perfect employment service centers and 
agencies, and open up step by step a number of windows for the 
labor market in coastal areas, border areas, and areas outside 
China. It is important to expedite the cultivation of the 
technology and personnel markets. We will encourage all major 
technology development bodies to enter the market in various 
forms, build up unified and open technology information systems 
and propagation networks across the province, and set up markets 
for technology, patents, and personnel in a number of cities, 
including Wuhan. 
  6. It is important to implement the strategy of 
"rejuvenating Hubei through the application of science and 
education," and enhance the overall quality of both the national 
economy and laborers. 
  Conscientious efforts will be made to carry out the "Law on 
Scientific and Technological Progress" with a view to closely 
integrating science and technology with the economy. On the 
basis of continuing to strengthen basic research and develop 
high and new technologies, we will focus on spreading the use of 
applied research as well as scientific and technological 
results, and on accelerating the process of turning scientific 
and technological results into real productive power. We will 
continue to bring up leading figures in rural areas who can 
guide peasants to get rich through the application of science 
and technology. Efforts will be made to center scientific 
research and development around pillar industries and industrial 
products, and to expand channels for integrating science and 
technology with economic development by using methods of the 
market economy. In line with the principle of "stabilizing one 
field while a giving free hand to others," we will further relax 
control over the work of scientific research institutions and 
personnel, so that more scientific and technological forces can 
be directed toward the main battlefield of economic development. 
A technological progress mechanism combining market, scientific 
research, and production will be gradually set up in enterprises 
with a view to turning enterprises into main bodies of 
scientific and technological development. 
  To enhance the quality of laborers, the most essential 
factor 
is education. We will carry out in depth the "Outline on the 
Reform and Development of China's Education," put education in a 
strategic position and give priority to its development, 
increase input, deepen reform, and vigorously promote the cause 
of education. It is imperative to continuously readjust and 
optimize the structure of education, conscientiously implement 
the "Law on Compulsory Education," reinforce elementary 
education, vigorously promote vocational and adult education, 
steadily develop higher education, and try hard to improve 
school-running conditions. It is important to conscientiously 
carry out the "Law on Teachers," earnestly protect the 
legitimate interests and rights of teachers, and reinforce the 
building of the contingent of teachers. We will also grant 
greater autonomy to schools in handling school-running affairs, 
develop school-run industries, and encourage and support all 
social sectors in making donations to schools and in running 
nongovernmental teaching institutions. 
  Intellectuals are playing a specially important role in the 
modernization drive. We should have full confidence in the vast 
numbers of intellectuals politically, give them a free hand in 
their work, take good care of their lives, cultivate in the 
entire society a sound social practice of respecting knowledge 
and qualified personnel, and create a favorable social 
environment for intellectuals to display intelligence and wisdom 
in work. Handsome rewards should be given to intellectuals who 
have made outstanding contributions. We sincerely welcome 
people who have studied abroad to take part in Hubei's 
construction in various ways, assuring them of preferential 
treatment and allowing them to come and go freely. 
  The final goal of economic development is to constantly 
improve the material and cultural lives of the masses of people. 
This year, thanks to the salary reform, workers and staff of 
administrative organs have seen increases in their income, while 
the income of those working in enterprises will also increase 
with the development of production. Moreover, the income of 
peasants has also increased as a result of the growing rural 
economy and increases in the purchase prices of agricultural 
products. While trying to increase incomes, we will continue to 
improve the living standards of urban and rural residents, pay 
attention to the "shopping basket" project and the construction 
of urban facilities, accelerate the development of public 
health, improve the prevention and treatment of local diseases 
such as snail fever and Keding disease, vigorously promote 
cultural undertakings, and bring about a fairly great 
improvement to the quality of people's lives. What merits 
special notice is the relatively difficult situation of the 
masses who live in poor areas as well as workers working in 
enterprises which are plagued by poor economic results and which 
have suspended production entirely or partially. Governments at 
all levels should adopt positive measures to help them solve 
difficulties. 
  Family planning, land management, and environmental 
protection are China's basic national policies. We must 
conscientiously implement these policies and try to achieve 
outstanding results in the work. The birth rate in our province 
has exceeded the country's average level in recent years; 
therefore, we must adopt effective measures to put an end to 
this situation. Results in population control will constitute 
an important part of the appraisal of the work results of party 
and government leaders at all levels. It is imperative to 
strictly implement laws, rules, and regulations on family 
planning, to focus the family planning work on rural and urban 
floating populations, and to firmly control the birth rate 
within the scope specified by the state. We will value land 
highly, strictly control land earmarked for basic construction, 
put into practice the system for the basic protection of 
farmland, build up a farmland compensation mechanism, and 
enhance the utilization rate of land. We will unswervingly 
fulfill the strategic task of "afforesting Hubei within 10 
years," and basically open up all uncultivated mountains this 
year. Continued efforts will be made to protect all kinds of 
natural resources, prevent industrial pollution, and bring about 
a well-coordinated development to environmental protection and 
the economy. 
  III. Speed Up the Pace of Reform and Carefully Carry 
Out Reform in All Fields 
  This year is a crucial one for making key breakthroughs in 
reform and pushing forward reform as a whole. The state has 
promulgated reform measures one after another on the management 
structures of finance and taxation, the monetary industry, 
investment, planning, and foreign trade, as well as on the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system. Successful 
implementation of all these reforms are of vital importance to 
the establishment of the framework of a socialist market 
economy. Governments at all levels should earnestly strengthen 
leadership over reform, carefully organize reform in different 
fields, and ensure that all reform measures put forward by the 
central authorities can be smoothly carried out in Hubei. 
  1. Efforts will be made to actively and steadily push 
forward the structural reform of macrolevel management. 
  First, the fiscal and taxation reform. This reform consists 
of three parts, namely, reform of the taxation system, the 
system whereby tax revenues are shared by central and local 
authorities, and the system of enterprise profit distribution. 
Reform in the above three fields is the most difficult and most 
important part of the entire reform, for it has a great bearing 
on the setup of interest distribution. Therefore, in order to 
succeed in all these reforms, we need to make careful plans. 
The general principle of the structural reform of tax division 
designed for all prefectures, cities, and autonomous prefectures 
by the provincial authorities is: Rationally divide revenues and 
expenditures in accordance with the principle and goal set by 
the central authorities concerning the local system of tax 
division and in line with the principle of seeking unity between 
administrative and financial powers; pay persistent attention to 
both overall design and phased implementation; successfully 
dovetail new structures with old ones; and gradually put the new 
into effect. After the system of tax division is adopted, the 
original financial structure will remain functional in 
principle, with a view to safeguarding the immediate interests 
of all localities. While doing a good job in the reform of the 
financial and taxation structure, we need to pay close attention 
to this year's financial work, ease contradictions between 
revenue and expenditure, and create conditions for a smooth 
implementation of other reforms. We will conscientiously carry 
out the new taxation system, strengthen the collection and 
management of taxes, and submit tax revenues to the state 
treasury in strict accordance with the stipulations of the tax 
division system. We should adhere to the principle of 
restraining all financial expenditures, and strictly observe 
restrictions set out in the budget. Financial departments at 
all levels should be responsible for balanced revenue and 
expenditure and none is allowed to go into the red. 
  Second, reform of the financial structure. The main tasks of 
financial reform are: Further transform the functions of the 
People's Bank; pay close attention to the establishment of 
policy banks, and transform existing specialized banks according 
to the general principles of commercial banks; actively and 
steadily develop the system of cooperative banks; make 
preparations for the open market operations of state treasury 
bonds and foreign exchanges; do a better job in running existing 
capital, securities, and foreign exchange swap markets; and 
conscientiously accomplish all work relating to the adoption of 
unified exchange rates. The tight supply of capital still 
remains a conspicuous contradiction in Hubei's economic 
development this year. Therefore, we must adopt effective 
measures to ease the situation. While continuously doing a good 
job in attracting savings deposits of all kinds, we will try 
hard to expand bond and insurance business, run well the money- 
lending market, expand sources of capital, and pool more funds 
for economic development. Further efforts will be made to make 
flexible use of capital in stock, accelerate the circulation of 
funds, and enhance the utilization efficiency of funds. It is 
necessary to continue to readjust and optimize the credit 
structure; try to satisfy rational demands for the purchase of 
agricultural and sideline products as well as the production and 
operation of state and provincial key construction projects, 
foreign trade operations, and trades and enterprises which enjoy 
sound economic efficiency; and ensure the normal operation of 
the national economy. 
  Third, reform of the investment structure. The focus of this 
year's reform is: Grant greater decisionmaking power on 
investment projects, and gradually build up risk 
responsibilities for legal person investments and bank loans. 
Enterprises are granted autonomy in making decisions concerning 
competitive project investments, and are responsible for all 
potential risks. Banks have the decisionmaking power on 
granting loans and are responsible for their own profits and 
losses. By using economic methods, we will improve control and 
regulation over the overall scale and the structure of 
investment; perfect the fund management of welfare investment 
and set up a provincial-level welfare investment contract 
system; expand the fund-raising channels as well as the 
operational scope of provincial-level investment companies, and 
increase their financial strength in operation; and improve the 
government's financial investment methods, and turn 
nonreimburasable investment into compensatory share-holding 
investment. 
  Fourth, reform of commodity prices. This year, the state 
is to appropriately readjust the prices of energy, grain, and 
cotton. With the addition of the impact produced by last year's 
price rises, it is an arduous task to keep price rises under 
control. Governments at all levels should earnestly strengthen 
leadership over price control, carefully organize the 
implementation of reform measures, and strive to bring price 
rises below the country's average level. To alleviate pressure 
produced by price rises, we should, on the one hand, try hard to 
increase effective social supply, especially the supply of 
agricultural and sideline products; on the other hand, adapt 
ourselves to the new situation resulting from changes in the 
mechanism of price formation, set up a reserves system for a 
number of consumer goods which are closely related to the basic 
needs of the masses, such as grain, pork, eggs, and sugar, as 
well as key means of agricultural production; and use economic 
means to make timely readjustments to market prices. 
  2. Focus will be placed on the establishment of a 
modern enterprise system, and enterprise reform will be deepened 
in a comprehensive way. 
  Establishing a modern economic system is the goal of 
enterprise reform and a fundamental method for revitalizing 
state-owned enterprises. We should seize the present favorable 
opportunities in reform; continue implementing the "Enterprise 
Law" and "Regulations on Changing the Operational Mechanism of 
State-Owned Enterprises"; do a good job in three internal 
reforms on the labor, personnel, and distribution of 
enterprises; have the courage to explore effective ways to 
establish a modern enterprise system, and provide the high- 
speed economic growth with a strong motive force. The 
provincial authorities plan to carry out experiments with the 
modern enterprise system in 50 selected large and medium-sized 
industrial and commercial enterprises, including the Wuhan Iron 
and Steel Plant, the Dongqi Company, the Jinmen 400,000-tonne 
wax-splitting project, the Qingjiang Development Company, and 
the Houwang Group; and allow about 10 qualified enterprises to 
list on stock exchanges or to issue stocks outside China. These 
influential enterprise experiments will surely bring along the 
development of related enterprises. We will continue to 
transform enterprises into share-holding cooperative 
enterprises, and try to push the number of share-holding 
enterprises to 1,000 this year, thus laying the foundation for 
the adoption of the modern enterprise system in state-owned 
enterprises. It is imperative to vigorously push forward the 
structural reform of property rights, pay close attention to 
appraising properties and funds as well as defining property 
rights, settle claims and clear up debts, accelerate the 
establishment of the property rights exchange market, trade-in 
idle assets of state-owned enterprises and auction off 
enterprises, and standardize trading behavior. The provincial 
authorities will set up a supervisory committee on state-owned 
assets, and experiment with the practice in 40 assigned pillar 
enterprises with a view to reinforcing supervision over 
state-owned assets. 
  3. Vigorous efforts need to be made to push forward 
reforms in the social guarantee and housing systems. 
  The focus of reform in the social guarantee system is to 
further expand the coverage of pension and medical insurance. 
The pension and medical insurance of urban workers and staff 
should be jointly borne by units and individuals, combining 
overall social arrangements with individual accounts; while in 
rural areas where conditions allow, a pension and insurance 
system based on individual savings accumulations will be carried 
out on the basis of the peasants' own will. It is imperative to 
develop and perfect the rural cooperative medical care system; 
expand the coverage of job-awaiting insurance; gradually set up 
a unified job-awaiting insurance system covering workers and 
staff of state-owned, collective, and private enterprises, as 
well as Chinese staff in foreign-invested enterprises; improve 
management services over the social insurance of retired and 
job-awaiting personnel of enterprises; and gradually reach the 
goal that enterprises are engaged in providing social welfare. 
  It is important to conscientiously implement the "Decision 
of 
the State Council on Accelerating Reform of the Urban Housing 
System," and speed up the pace of urban housing reform. We will 
adhere to the principle of "paying simultaneous attention to the 
sale, lease, and construction of residential houses"; and focus 
our efforts on the sales of houses, mainly public ones, in an 
active and steady way. We will step up efforts in fulfilling 
Hubei's housing program as part of its efforts to attain a 
fairly comfortable life, expedite the construction of urban 
residential houses, alleviate the tight supply of residential 
houses in urban areas, and put into practice a housing provident 
fund system in a comprehensive way. Housing reform is expected 
to be unfolded in all counties (cities) across the province this 
year. 
  4. Efforts will be made to speed up the pace of 
institutional reform. 
  We should speed up the pace of institutional reform in order 
to suit the needs of the economic structural reform. In line 
with the general arrangements of the State Council, the 
provincial authorities have put forward the general guiding 
ideology and requirements for Hubei's institutional reform: In 
line with the principle of separating the functions of the 
government from those of an enterprise as well as the principle 
of simplification, uniformity, and high efficiency, we will 
focus our attention on changing the functions of the government, 
strengthen the work of comprehensive departments, abolish or 
merge certain specialized economic departments or organs with 
overlapping functions and duties, cut down the staff and 
structural levels of administrative organs, and turn them into 
highly capable and highly efficient organs. In line with this 
requirement, all administrative organs across the province are 
expected to start the institutional reform this year and ensure 
that the work can be totally accomplished next year. 
  IV. Step Up the Intensity of Opening Up, and 
Increase the Proportion of the Export-Oriented Economy in the 
Entire National Economy 
  The goal of struggle for Hubei this year is to realize "two 
surpasses" and "four breakthroughs"; in other words, we plan to 
overfulfill the task for foreign exports set out in the Eighth 
Five- Year Plan one year ahead of schedule; attain a growth rate 
that is higher than the country's average; earn a total of $2 
billion of foreign exchange from exports, registering an 
increase of 18.6 percent; set up 1,500 new foreign-invested 
enterprises, pushing the total number to 5,500; utilize $1 
billion of foreign investment; and attain a total output value 
and sales revenue of over 4 billion yuan in foreign-invested 
enterprises. To realize the above goals, we should pay special 
attention to work in the following fields: 
  First, we should strengthen the building of export-oriented 
industries and their production bases, and further arouse the 
enthusiasm of all sides in developing an export-oriented 
economy. 1) We are determined to develop in the coming several 
years three to five major fist products which can bring about a 
total export volume of over 100 million yuan, thus upgrading and 
increasing the batch production of exported products. The 
provincial authorities will set up a special fund for 
technological renovation to give key support to the development 
of export-oriented industries. 2) Relying on pillar export 
enterprises, we will break barriers between regions and trades; 
organize and set up a number of large-scale industry-trade, 
agriculture-trade, and technology-trade enterprise groups which 
are economically strong and are under intensive management; 
grant them autonomy in handling foreign-related operations; and 
push them directly into international markets. 3) We will 
strive to persuade the state Import-Export Credit Bank to set up 
a representative office in Hubei, try our best to establish 
financial companies specialized in import and export businesses, 
and provide powerful financial support for the development of 
the export-oriented economy. 4) It is necessary to give full 
play to the enthusiasm of "five contingents," vigorously open up 
diversified international markets, inject greater vigor into 
exports, and give shape to a setup of large-scale foreign trade 
and opening up. 5) Further efforts will be made to run well 
exchange-earning foreign-invested enterprises, support 
state-owned and collective enterprises in developing 
exchange-earning products, try hard to enable township and town 
enterprises to open wider to the outside world, develop an 
exchange-earning agriculture, and give shape to a number of new 
exchange-earning contingents. 6) Strides will be made in 
further expanding economic and technological cooperation with 
foreign countries, thus bringing along Hubei's export of 
complete sets of equipment, technology, and related products. 
7) It is necessary to continue opening Wuhan and Huangshi Port 
to foreign vessels; open ports in Yichang, Shashi, and Xiangfan 
as soon as possible; and provide better services for the 
development of the export-oriented economy. 
  Second, we will intensify the utilization of foreign 
investment; and make better and greater use of foreign 
resources, technologies, and markets. We will bring into full 
play the leading role of Wuhan as well as the favorable 
conditions of open cities including Wuhan, Huangshi, and 
Yichang; make good, flexible, and sufficient use of preferential 
policies specially designed for open cities; attract more 
foreign businessmen to invest in our province; and bring along 
the exploration and development of the Chang Jiang economic 
belt. We will adapt ourselves to new situations resulting from 
the taxation reform; and, based on the total capital investment 
laid down in previously promulgated policies, step up efforts to 
amend, perfect, and reiterate preferential policies which aim to 
encourage foreign businessmen to invest in Hubei, thus setting 
their minds at ease. It is necessary to introduce more foreign 
investment for development zones of all kinds at different 
levels, attract foreign businessmen to make concentrated 
investment in large-scale development projects, establish small 
development zones with various features, and develop a number of 
large-scale, highly efficient, high-tech projects which can 
produce foreign exchange in large amounts. Further efforts will 
be made to expand the cooperative fields in which foreign 
investment is utilized, guide foreign businessmen to participate 
in the construction of infrastructural facilities and basic 
industries, and engage ourselves in a number of large-scale 
projects. We will select a number of our best enterprises and 
best products to set up joint ventures with foreign investors, 
and speed up the pace of utilizing foreign funds to transform 
and "graft" state-owned enterprises. Vigorous efforts will be 
made to consolidate already attained results in opening up, pay 
close attention to the implementation of projects which use 
loans of foreign governments, and do a good job in the follow-up 
of contracts which were signed at the economic and trade talks 
held in Hong Kong last year. Earnest efforts will be made to 
run well existing foreign-invested enterprises, appropriately 
solve problems cropping up during the development of 
foreign-invested enterprises, and make a success of every 
foreign-invested enterprise we have set up. It is necessary to 
further consolidate cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Taiwan; vigorously open markets in Europe, the United States, 
and Japan; and expand the scope of introduction of foreign 
investment. This year, the provincial authorities are planning 
to again hold large-scale economic and trade talks in France 
with a view to promoting Hubei's cooperation with West European 
countries. It is imperative to strengthen the building of open 
windows; set up more open windows in foreign countries, areas 
outside the Chinese mainland, and China's coastal areas; and 
expand the development channels of the export-oriented economy. 
We will give full play to the role of foreign-related 
departments, such as foreign affairs offices, overseas Chinese 
affairs offices, tourist agencies, and foreign-related 
propaganda departments, with the aim of giving form to a unified 
force for the development of the export-oriented economy. We 
will step up efforts in formulating remuneration policies which 
are aimed at encouraging the development of the export-oriented 
economy; and give encouragement and rewards politically and 
economically to individuals who have made contributions in 
introducing foreign investment, to units which can earn large 
amounts of foreign exchange through exports, and to foreign 
trade companies and localities which have attained outstanding 
results in exports. We will set up authoritative leading groups 
for the work in different fields, headed by vice governors in 
charge and attended by principal leaders of all relevant 
departments; establish work organs to strengthen the 
coordination and management of foreign-related economic and 
trade work; simplify the examination and approval procedures on 
foreign investment projects by adopting the practice of "one 
joint office using only one chop"; and provide the development 
of the export- oriented economy with a powerful organizational 
guarantee. 
<H5>  V. Simultaneous Attention Should Be Paid to Two Types of </H5>
Work With a View To Further Strengthening the Building of 
Socialist Spiritual Civilization, Democracy, and the Legal System 
  Strengthening the building of spiritual civilization, 
democracy, and the legal system is an essential requirement for 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. During the 
process of reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, we 
must consistently uphold the principle of "paying simultaneous 
attention to two types of work, attaching equal importance to 
both," and strive to enhance the building of spiritual 
civilization, democracy, and the legal system to a new level. 
  Vigorous efforts will be made to promote the building of 
spiritual civilization. An important task in the building of 
spiritual civilization is to arm the people with scientific 
theories, guide them with correct publicity, mold them with a 
noble spirit, encourage them with fine works of literature and 
art, and bring up generations of well-educated and 
well-disciplined socialist new people who have high ideals and 
high moral standards. To attain this goal, we need to 
strengthen ideological and ethical education on patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism; vigorously advocate social and 
professional ethics; and continue to carry out in-depth 
activities including establishing and advocating new practices 
in industries and trades, emulating Lei Feng at work posts, and 
becoming advanced units and outstanding households in building 
two civilizations. It is imperative to further strengthen 
ideological and political work; guide the people, especially the 
young people and children, to establish the correct ideals, 
beliefs, outlook on life and values; advocate a healthy and 
civilized lifestyle; and try hard to establish a sound general 
mood in society. Cultural workers should uphold the principle 
of "two serves" and the principle of "letting a hundred flowers 
blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," vigorously 
promote the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation, 
actively use for reference civilization results of foreign 
countries, create more fine works which have both a rich flavor 
of our times and special features of Hubei, and enrich and 
enliven the cultural life of the masses. To promote sports, we 
should bring about a coordinated development between athletic 
and mass sports, and strive to enhance the physical fitness of 
the people of Hubei through sports. The press and publishing 
and radio and television departments should uphold the principle 
of unity, stability, and encouragement; engage mainly in 
positive propaganda; strengthen propagation and coverage of 
reform and construction, and provide the people with a correct 
guide to opinion. Centering around the establishment of a 
socialist economic structure, we will strengthen social 
scientific research, and provide a smooth progress of reform 
with a theoretical guarantee. To promote spiritual 
civilization, we should concentrate our efforts on the building 
of it. We will conscientiously implement cultural and economic 
policies; strengthen the building of cultural, sports, radio and 
television, publishing, and audiovisual facilities; and pay 
special attention to the construction of a diving pool and a 
satellite up- link station. 
  Earnest efforts will be made to strengthen the building of 
socialist democracy and the legal system. Governments at all 
levels should conscientiously carry out resolutions adopted by 
the people's congresses and their standing committees at the 
same level, voluntarily subject themselves to supervision, give 
full play to the role of the people's consultative conferences 
in providing political consultation and democratic supervision, 
and give rein to the bridging functions of a number of mass 
organizations, such as trade unions, youth leagues, and women's 
federations. Efforts should be made to open up more channels 
for the people to express their views and opinions, give play to 
the roles of experts and policymaking consultative organs of all 
kinds, and make policy decisions in a democratic and scientific 
way. Further efforts will be made to strengthen the building of 
the legal system; formulate and perfect administrative rules and 
regulations which aim to protect reform and opening up, 
strengthen macroeconomic control and regulation, and standardize 
microeconomic behavior; and work out laws and regulations for 
major economic activities to follow. It is important to further 
perfect the administrative system of law enforcement and 
supervision; carry out official duties according to the law, and 
firmly put an end to failure to act according to the law, 
failure to strictly enforce the law, and failure to affix 
responsibility to violators of the law. 
  Great efforts need to be made to improve all facets of 
public security, strictly combat all kinds of criminal 
activities and economic crimes according to law, and continue to 
carry out the campaign of "eliminating pornographic activities" 
and "stamping out six evils." Efforts will be made to launch 
concentrated campaigns and special-purpose struggles on 
different scales to crack down on crimes and social evils that 
the masses particularly resent. We will continue to uphold the 
principle of "paying simultaneous attention to cracking down on 
and preventing crimes, taking both stopgap and radical measures, 
and putting stress on effecting a permanent cure," strictly 
implement a responsibility system among leading cares for the 
comprehensive improvement of public security, mobilize the 
masses to effect prevention and solving of crimes, carry through 
to the grass-roots level all measures for improving public 
security, and create a sound social environment for the masses 
of people in which they can live and work in peace and 
contentment. Meanwhile, to safeguard the stability of society, 
we should attach great importance to mediating and handling 
contradictions among the people, and settle problems before they 
get out of hand. 
  Strides will be made to conduct extensive education on the 
importance of national defense, increase public awareness of the 
need for it, and make a success of the work with regard to the 
militia and the reserve service. Continued efforts will be made 
to strengthen the building of the Armed Police and public 
security contingents. It is important that the Army supports 
and cherishes the people while the government supports the Army 
and gives preferential treatment to families of servicemen and 
martyrs, with a view to consolidating unity between the Army and 
the government and between the Army and the people. We should 
consistently show concern for and support the building of our 
Army. Efforts will be made to bring into full play the 
important roles of the People's Liberation Army, the Armed 
Police, the public security forces, and the vast numbers of 
militiamen in maintaining social stability and promoting the 
modernization drive. 
  It is the common responsibility of the people of the whole 
province to consolidate and strengthen unity between 
nationalities. We should carry out nationality policies in a 
comprehensive way, uphold and perfect the regional autonomy of 
minority nationalities, grant more support to areas inhabited by 
minority nationalities, and bring about a common prosperity 
among all nationalities. 
<H5>  VI. Further Emancipate the Mind, Improve the Work Style, </H5>
Pay Close Attention to Implementation, and Ensure Comprehensive 
Fulfillment of This Year's Tasks of National Economic and Social 
Development 
  This year, we are faced with arduous tasks and work in 
reform. To ensure a comprehensive fulfillment of all tasks, we 
must further emancipate the mind, forge ahead and open up new 
paths, improve our work style, and make a success of the work in 
all fields of endeavor in a creative way. 
  Ideology leads to action. Without emancipation of the mind, 
there will not be any new ideas, new moves, or new 
breakthroughs. Under the present new situation in particular, in 
which the economy is being accelerated and reform is being 
deepened comprehensively, there is a greater need for freeing 
the mind. First, we should conscientiously study the "Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping," arm leading cadres at all levels with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, and seek unity of understanding and 
action in the entire province. Through the practice of "study, 
practice, restudy, and more practice," we can master the spirit 
and essence of the theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, constantly acquire more knowledge about the 
market economy, enhance our ability to keep a rein on the whole 
situation, and improve the standards and work efficiency of the 
leadership. Second, we need to firmly establish the concept of 
centering around economic construction, and enhance public 
awareness of the need for development. It is necessary to urge 
all localities and departments to earnestly proceed in their 
work with the grand goal of catching up with and surpassing the 
country's average level and bringing about greater economic 
development; and to encourage them to translate the goal into 
their practical work by working out new ideas, arrangements, and 
measures, with a view to combining the efforts of all sectors of 
our province to accelerate economic development. Third, we 
should further increase public awareness of the need for reform 
and opening up as well as the spirit of having the initiative to 
open new paths; earnestly act in line with the principle of 
"three beneficials" raised by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and use it 
as a standard to check and guide our ideology and actions; break 
through old conventions and barriers; create a more relaxed 
environment for grass-roots units and the masses to carry out 
reform and development; and encourage and guide the masses to 
have the courage to open up new paths, to experiment with new 
ideas, and to do what our ancestors never did. Meanwhile, we 
also need to be good at protecting the enthusiasm of grass-roots 
units and the masses in reform and opening up, and respect the 
spirit of initiative of the masses. 
  To fulfill all development goals set for this year, it is 
vitally important to earnestly improve our work style and bring 
about real improvement to our work in a down-to-earth manner. 
We will continue to conduct and perfect all good practices 
carried out last year, namely "the year of implementation"; and 
turn them into a common practice and common system with a view 
to achieving more practical results in our work. To accomplish 
all major tasks in this year's reform and construction, the 
provincial government has worked out a concrete work schedule, 
and the governor and vice governors are to take charge of and be 
personally responsible for work in different fields. All 
localities and relevant departments are required to work in 
close coordination, assign leading cadres to take personal 
charge of specific tasks with feasible measures, check out their 
work results at the end of every year, and not stop until our 
goal is reached. We will reward those who have successfully 
accomplished their tasks, and punish those who fail. Facing all 
these arduous tasks, complicated situations, and numerous 
difficulties in this year's reform and construction, leaders 
must go down and carry out their work at the grass-roots in 
order to make a success of it. Leaders at all levels should 
take the lead to improve their work style, extricate themselves 
from numerous meetings and piles of documents, reduce 
unnecessary social entertainment, concentrate their attention on 
handling major issues and solving practical problems, take the 
initiative to go down and carry out official business in 
grass-roots units and among the masses, energetically encourage 
the practice of conducting investigations and studies, watch out 
for and promptly discover symptoms of unhealthy tendencies, make 
policy decisions in a decisive manner, and gain the initiative 
over the whole situation. 
  It is necessary to change the functions of the government in 
line with the institutional reform, simplify procedures for 
handling affairs, and enhance work efficiency. It is imperative 
to further straighten out administrative discipline and improve 
the work style of the government, put an absolute end to 
violations of previously issued orders and bans, and ensure the 
smooth implementation of government decrees. 
  A deepened reform and opening up needs greater efforts to 
combat corruption and advocate clean administration. The 
provincial party committee has named this year "the year of 
building clean administration," in which new clean and honest 
practices are expected to be introduced. All government 
workers, especially cadres at the county (department) level and 
above, should be clean and well-disciplined, and act strictly in 
accordance with all stipulations on maintaining clean 
government. We should strengthen auditing work, give play to 
supervisory functions, continue to investigate and crack serious 
cases, and make public a number of typical cases so as to show 
our people the determination of the party and the government and 
gain their confidence. Continued efforts will be made to 
absolutely put an end to unhealthy trends, such as arbitrarily 
raising funds and collecting fees, traveling overseas at the 
expense of the state, and purchasing luxury limousines and 
building luxury houses against relevant regulations. Organs 
directly affiliated to the provincial authorities should play an 
exemplary role in the campaign of combating corruption and 
advocating clean administration. Principal provincial leaders 
and cadres in charge of organs directly under the provincial 
authorities should take the lead in accomplishing whatever they 
demand that their subordinates accomplish. The anticorruption 
campaign is a long-term struggle, and leading cadres at all 
levels must have the courage to take personal charge of this 
struggle, pay consistent attention to it, and carry out the 
struggle in a down-to-earth manner. We are determined to 
achieve real results and make substantive headway in this 
struggle this year. 
  Fellow Deputies, 
  Now is an excellent time for our province to catch up with 
and surpass the country's average development level. Our 
national economy has joined the "express line" of development, 
and we are faced with many major opportunities to expedite 
economic development. The constant deepening of reform and 
opening up, in particular, will surely inject greater vigor and 
life into future economic development. It is totally possible, 
as well as justified, that we should and can attain major 
breakthroughs in development, and we are fully confident of 
realizing this goal. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and under the leadership of the provincial party 
committee, let us closely rally around the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, emancipate our 
minds, work with one heart and one mind, forge ahead to open up 
new paths, carry out our work in real earnest, and strive to 
achieve this year's grand goal of "overfulfilling the plan, 
catching up with other parts of the country, mounting a new 
step, and attaining new breakthroughs in all industries and 
trades"!

  [Text] The Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee held a 
Standing Committee meeting yesterday morning to listen to a 
report on the implementation of the comprehensive plan for the 
opening up to the outside world of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong 
Nationalities Autonomous Prefecture. Standing Committee members 
of the provincial party committee, such as [provincial party 
Secretary ] Liu Fangren, Wang Siqi, (Wang Guanxian), Yuan 
Ronggui, (Li Wanru), (Wang Shouqi), Xia Guohua, (Huang Yao), and 
(Hu Jiansheng) attended the meeting. Attending the meeting as 
nonvoting delegates were Long Zhiyi, chairman of the provincial 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, Yu Zhonggui, political commissar of the provincial 
military command, Vice Governors (Gong Xianrong) and (Mo 
Shiren), and persons in charge of the provincial planning 
commission, the provincial nationalities affairs commission, the 
provincial science and technology commission, the provincial 
commission for restructuring the economy, and other departments 
for overall management. 
  In January, approved by the State Nationalities Affairs 
Commission and the State Commission for Restructuring Economy, 
the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Nationalities Autonomous 
Prefecture was slated as the nation's first national autonomous 
region experimental zone for reform and opening up to the 
outside world to probe the path of accelerating national 
autonomous region reform, opening up to the outside world, and 
economic development, and of being the first to establish a 
socialist market economic structure. 
  Prefectural Chief (Yao Maosen) briefed the meeting on the 
guiding ideology, line of thinking, goal, steps, and substance 
of the construction of the experimental zone for reform and 
opening up, on the short-term breakthroughs and long-term reform 
and development of zone's construction, and on the organization 
of plan for implementation centering on state policy. After the 
report, Wang Siqi, (Wang Guangxian), Long Zhiyi, and persons in 
charge of the provincial planning commission, the provincial 
education commission, the provincial department of 
communications, and the provincial department of forestry 
offered many good opinions and suggestions for the zone's plan 
of implementation. They expressed willingness to actively 
support the Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture in running the 
experimental zone well. The meeting adopted the experimental 
zone's plan of implementation. 
  Liu Fangren, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
said: The national autonomous region's experimental zone for 
reform and opening up of the Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture 
was the outcome of everybody's hard work. Departments concerned 
should give energetic support to the zone and make concerted 
efforts to run it well. The zone's plan of implementation is 
feasible as I see it. However, its specific measures should be 
further improved. He urged the prefecture to seize this 
opportunity, universally mobilize the broad masses of cadres and 
people, further emancipate the mind, pluck up confidence, rely 
on its own efforts, do solid work, and accelerate its own 
development.

  [Excerpts] At the provincial meeting on help-the-poor work 
and development, which was held yesterday [27 April], Liu 
Fangren, secretary of the provincial party committee, urged all 
sides concerned at various levels to emancipate their minds, 
seize opportunities, and make concerted herculean efforts to do 
a good job in work to help the poor. 
  In his speech, Li Fangren expounded in detail on the 
objective and significance of the province's work to help the 
poor and carry out development, approaching the subject through 
many methods and angles. He set clear and definite demands, 
remarking: Marked results have been achieved in our province's 
work to help the poor and carry out development, but compared 
with other parts of the country, our task remains a very arduous 
one of steadily solving the problem of sufficient food and 
clothing and of achieving a well-to- do standard of living. In 
terms of the overall situation, the country's rural economy at 
present has developed to the stage of moving from having 
sufficient food and clothing to striving for a well-to-do 
standard of living. Many areas in our province are still very 
poor, so the task of helping the poor remains very arduous. 
Therefore we must make great efforts to carry out our duties so 
as to enable all members of society to do a good job in work to 
help the poor. In accordance with the requirements of the 
state's program to help the poor, which requires that the 
problem of sufficient food and clothing for 80 million people be 
solved within seven years, and in light of the realities in our 
province, the overall goal of the work to help the poor, 
beginning in 1994 and continuing to the year 2000, is to help 10 
million people basically shake off absolute poverty. Focusing 
on this goal, the basic line of thinking in the work to help the 
poor and carry out development, both at present and for a 
continuing period of time, is to uphold as the guide Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, to emancipate our 
minds, to seek truth from facts, to deepen reform, to explore 
new paths in the work to help the poor and carry out 
development, to develop the spirit of self-reliance and hard 
work, to adhere to the development-oriented principle guiding 
work to help the poor, and to accelerate the pace of economic 
development and the construction of infrastructures. We should 
strive to improve the efficiency of the work to help the poor 
and carry out development by orienting our efforts toward market 
needs, exploiting natural resources, and relying on scientific 
and technological advances. Energetically developing the 
productive forces, continuously increasing poor peasants' 
household incomes, steadily solving the problem of sufficient 
food and clothing, and eliminating absolute poverty should be 
taken as the basic starting points and goals of the work to help 
the poor. 
  Liu Fangren said: By carrying out the development-oriented 
work to help the poor, we mean encouraging the broad masses of 
cadres and people in poverty-stricken areas to maintain the 
spirit of self-reliance and hard work, exploit and utilize local 
natural resources, and develop the production of commodities 
with state support and by gearing themselves to market needs and 
relying on scientific and technological advances. [passage 
omitted] 
  Liu Fangren stated: To do a good job in the work to help the 
poor, we should foster the ideas of the market economy, 
development-oriented work to help the poor, comprehensive 
development, and efficiency. [passage omitted] 
  All units and departments, as well as trades and 
professions, 
must work out their own plans for work to help the poor and 
carry out development, based on the Help-the-Poor Program. 
[passage omitted] 
  Liu Fangren urged: Party committees and governments at all 
levels should genuinely put the work to help the poor and carry 
out development in a position of importance and place this work 
at the top of their agendas. All poverty-stricken counties 
should regard it as a central task to help the poor through 
development and solve the problem of sufficient food and 
clothing for the masses of people. Principal leaders of party 
committees and governments at all levels must take up the work 
personally, and must pursue not only a system under which the 
governor or magistrates of poverty-stricken counties is or are 
responsible for the work, but also a system under which party 
committee secretaries are responsible for the job. [passage 
omitted] 
  The meeting was presided over by Wang Siqi, deputy secretary 
of the provincial party committee. Vice Governor Yuan Ronggui, 
member of the provincial party committee's standing committee, 
conveyed the spirit of the national conference on work to help 
the poor and carry out development. The other party, 
government, and Army leaders attending the meeting were Long 
Zhiyi, Liang Mingde, (Wang Guangxun), Li Wanlu, Wang Shouting, 
Xia Guohua, (Huang Yao), (Hu Jiansheng), (Wang Anze), (Zhang 
Weiqing), (Meng Shusheng), and Deng Guoyong.

  [Text] In accordance with the method of managing the 
accreditation of foreign businessmen's investment assets, which 
was issued jointly by the State Commodity Inspection Bureau and 
the Ministry of Finance, foreign businessmen investing in our 
province should apply with the provincial commodity inspection 
bureau for asset accreditation certificates as of 1 May. 
  As our province opens wider to the outside world, the number 
of foreign businessmen investing in our province has increased. 
They have played a positive role in promoting our province's 
economic development. As far as their investment assets are 
concerned, however, as in other parts of the country, there are 
such problems as reporting low-priced goods as high-priced ones 
and substituting good-quality goods with substandard ones. 
According to an assessment of the assets of 82 foreign 
businesses which was conducted last year by the provincial 
commodity inspection bureau, of assets reported as being worth 
$11.68 million, after inspection and verification, were found to 
be worth $9.97 million, with the gap amounting to $1.71 million. 
For various reasons, 90 percent of the current assets of 
foreign businessmen investing in our province have not been 
assessed and verified by any commodity inspection organ. There 
is no way to calculate the losses inflicted on the Chinese side. 
  To safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of 
investors 
and to establish a normal investment order, the State Commodity 
Inspection Bureau and the Ministry of Finance promulgated the 
method of managing the accreditation of foreign businessmen's 
investment assets. To implement the method effectively, the 
provincial commodity inspection bureau set up an accreditation 
office at the beginning of this year and provided it with 
professionals so as to make it easier for the office to carry 
out its work.

  [Text] At the Lianyun Guesthouse in Kunming yesterday 
afternoon and this morning, the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee 
held a meeting of the CPC Committee secretaries of prefectures, 
autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties to discuss how to 
deepen reform and accelerate economic development. Pu Chaozhu, 
secretary of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee, chaired the 
meeting. To deepen reform and develop the economy, he stressed, 
are our central tasks at present. All our work should focus on 
and serve this work. 
  After listening to experience-exchange speeches by Li 
Zhenghuang, secretary of the Yiliang County CPC Committee, on 
gearing the use of barren hills to the market and on the 
compensated transfer of land use rights; Zhu Peifu, secretary of 
Yuxi City CPC Committee, on implementing the share-holding 
system in town and township enterprises; Liu Yiping, secretary 
of Luxi County CPC Committee, on making great efforts to develop 
the individual and private economy; and Hou Chengming, secretary 
of Chengjiang County CPC Committee, on small state-owned 
commercial enterprises run by local people; Pu Chaozhu made a 
comprehensive and systematic speech, mainly on what issues 
should be grasped in deepening reform at and below the county 
level. The focus of deepening reform below the county level, he 
stressed, is to accurately discover where lies the potential of 
the productive forces and where such potential can be released. 
It is necessary to concentrate efforts on three aspects of 
work. The first is to readjust the single-product economic 
structure and the ownership structure. The second is to change 
ways of production and operation in rural areas and to develop 
socialized large-scale production. The third is to change the 
management structure in rural areas and spread the experience of 
the three combination-one system. 
  Pu Chaozhu elaborated primarily on readjusting the 
single-product economic structure and the ownership structure. 
Major measures to be taken are: First, to turn small 
state-owned enterprises into private or collective enterprises 
through auctioning, leasing, or other ways, and to invigorate 
small enterprises; second, to energetically develop individual 
economy and private enterprises; third, to carry out the auction 
or compensated transfer to individuals or collectives the 
management and use rights of barren hills and land in a bid to 
develop and make use of barren hills; fourth, to energetically 
spread the share-holding cooperation system and go all-out to 
develop town and township enterprises. 
  Pu Chaozhu urged various localities to further emancipate 
their minds; update concepts; adhere to the principle of putting 
practice first; take part in practice; in light of local 
realities to seriously use as reference the good experiences of 
Yiliang, Yuxi, Luxi, Chengjiang, and other localities; 
accelerate the pace of reform; and promote comprehensive 
economic development. 
  Zhao Shumin, member of the Standing Committee of the Yunnan 
Provincial CPC Committee; Bao Yongkang, vice chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial People's Congress; 
and Vice Governor Yang Jianqiang also spoke at the meeting. 
  Liang Jinquan, deputy secretary of the Yunnan Provincial CPC 
Committee, and Zhang Baosan, Meng Jiyao, and Wang Tianxi, 
members of the Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial CPC 
Committee, also attended.

  [Text] Governor He Zhiqiang, who is now studying at the 
Central Party School, sent a written address entitled "Opening 
Up, Forge Ahead, and Score New Brilliant Achievements" to the 
Provincial Propaganda and Ideological Work Meeting. In this 
speech, He Zhiqiang recalled the remarkable achievements scored 
on all fronts in reform and opening up in our province over the 
past 15 years. He emphasized that to achieve the strategic 
second-step goal under the new situation, we must pay great 
attention to the party's propaganda and ideological work; 
constantly raise the level of ethics and political consciousness 
of the masses of people of various nationalities; and form a 
powerful ideological propelling force and a spiritual force of 
unity among the people in the course of reform, opening up, and 
modernization. It is not only party committees that should 
grasp propaganda and ideological work, but governments as well. 
It is not only propaganda departments that should grasp 
propaganda and ideological work, but economic departments, as 
well. The leadership and the rank and file, and various trades 
and professions should make concerted efforts to carry out work 
in this regard. Only in this way will a new situation emerge in 
propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological 
work should focus closely on the main theme of reform, 
development, and stability; take economic construction as the 
center; and uphold unity, stability, and promotion. It is 
necessary to more widely publicize the study of the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics; by publicizing 
theories on the socialist market economy, to enable the cadres 
and the people to establish a sense of the socialist market 
economy and concentrate their attention on the four 
modernizations so that the economy will grow further; and to lay 
a foundation for social progress and social stability. 
  Propaganda and ideological work should regard as its 
objective the training of four have's new people, should uphold 
the standard of three beneficial's, should have clearer targets, 
and should encourage and carry forward the pioneering spirit. 
Through propaganda and education, propaganda and ideological 
work should integrate new concepts that are in line with the 
market economy with traditional fine values of the Chinese 
nation, and should develop the spirit of hard work and selfless 
dedication so that the dynamic role of the pioneering spirit in 
the new period can be brought into full play in the practice of 
reform and construction. 
  Propaganda and ideological work should energetically explore 
new ways and new methods; improve operational mechanisms; 
develop various carriers; and make use of modern transmitting 
devices so that propaganda and ideological work can change from 
something invisible into something visible, thus increasing its 
impact and effectiveness. It should fully arouse the enthusiasm 
of cadres, workers, and staff members concerning the promotion 
of progress and the development of various trades, professions, 
and undertakings, Governor He Zhiqiang said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [By reporters Sun Benyao (1327 2609 1031) and Qian Yonghong </F>
(6929 0737 5725)] 
  [Text] Hohhot, 4 May (XINHUA) -- When State Council Premier 
Li Peng inspected work in Inner Mongolia, he stressed that it is 
necessary to conscientiously implement the central authorities' 
policy on seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up 
wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability; to 
attach importance to integrating the growth rate with 
efficiency; and to promote reform, opening up, and economic 
construction more successfully. 
  After satisfactorily concluding his visit to four countries 
in Central Asia and Mongolia, Premier Li Peng conducted a work 
inspection of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region from 30 
April to 3 May. Accompanied by Wang Qun, autonomous regional 
party committee secretary, and Wuliji, autonomous regional 
people's government chairman, Premier Li Peng zestfully 
inspected factories, enterprises, microwave communications 
equipment, and a large power plant under construction in the 
vicinity of a coal pit; visited the mausoleum of Chengjisihan 
[Genghis Khan] despite rains; and called on herdsmen at their 
homes. 
  Li Peng inspected the Qingsong Garment Co., Ltd. He was very 
pleased when he learned that the Western-style clothing produced 
by the company had won a leading place in a contest between 
China's top 10 famous brands of Western-style clothing held in 
April 1994 and that it had been exported in large quantities. 
He said: "The fact that the Qingsong Garment Co., Ltd. can 
produce such good Western-style clothing shows that remote, 
border areas, like those in the hinterland, are capable of 
turning out first-rate products as long as they gear their 
production to the needs of the market at home and abroad and as 
long as they adopt advanced technology and management." 
  Li Peng also inspected the Hohhot Machine Tool Accessories 
Plant. It is an old state-owned enterprise and is currently 
China's largest chuck-producing plant and largest chuck research 
and development center. The annual output of the Huanqiu- 
[universal] brand chuck with three and four claws and various 
power-driven chucks in the high- and medium-price r!nges 
accounts for 60 percent of the total chuck output in China; 
their products are sold to over 40 countries and regions of the 
world and have won several awards at home and abroad. After 
inspecting the plant's workshop, Li Peng said: "Why can the 
plant always maintain very good economic efficiency? The key 
lies in a good mechanism, specialized mass production, strict 
management, paying attention to quality, and establishing a 
business reputation on the market at home and abroad. It shows 
we also can successfully run the large and medium old 
enterprises owned by the state." He expressed the hope that the 
Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region can successfully sum up the 
experiences gained by the plant. 
  At a television conference room of the Inner Mongolia Radio 
and Television Station, Premier Li Peng had a teleconference 
meeting with leading comrades of 12 leagues and cities and 
listened to the work reports made by some leagues and cities. 
Li Peng affirmed the tremendous progress made by the Inner 
Mongolian Autonomous Region in all fields of endeavor and 
conveyed his warm regards to the broad masses of servicemen and 
people who had recently put out a forest fire. He praised the 
teleconference, saying: Holding a teleconference not only saves 
time and money but also improves work efficiency. It marks a 
big step toward the modernization of office work. 
  On the morning of 3 May, Li Peng listened to work reports by 
leading comrades of the autonomous regional party committee and 
government. First of all, he affirmed the important successes 
attained by the people of all nationalities in the Inner 
Mongolian Autonomous Region in promoting reform, opening up, and 
economic construction under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Li Peng said: I have visited Inner Mongolia 
six times and have witnessed the tremendous changes taking place 
in the region since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee. Inner Mongolia faced grain shortage in the 
past; now it is more than self-sufficient in its grain supply. 
This represents a remarkable success. Its animal husbandry has 
also enjoyed very great development. The Baotou Steel and Iron 
Corporation steel works has increased its annual output of steel 
from 1 million-plus tonnes in 1989 to 3 million tonnes now. 
Taking advantage of its abundant coal resources to build large 
power plants in the vicinity of coal pits, Inner Mongolia not 
only solved the problem of an electricity shortage but also 
supplied greater amounts of electricity to the power grid for 
Beijing, Tianjin, and Tanggu. He pointed out: Changing coal 
deliveries to electricity transmission is a strategic shift in 
Inner Mongolia's economy. Li Peng said he was very pleased to 
see that Inner Mongolia is enjoying political stability, unity 
between nationalities, and economic development, and that these 
have improved the people's living standards. 
  Touching on Inner Mongolia's economic work, Li Peng stressed 
that it is necessary to further do a good job of promoting 
agricultural and animal husbandry production. As China's 
population grows, its demand for grain will further increase. 
First, we must transform medium- and low-yield farmland to 
increase the per mu yield; and, second, we must expand the area 
of cultivated land in areas where conditions permit. Inner 
Mongolia has potential in this field. It is hoped that Inner 
Mongolia will become a base for the commercial production of 
agriculture and animal husbandry. Because Inner Mongolia boasts 
a relatively large proportion of state-owned heavy industries, 
his speech required that vigorous efforts be made to 
successfully run the large and medium enterprises owned by the 
state, to conscientiously analyze their situations, and to find 
concrete solutions to their existing problems. We must be 
confident that we are capable of managing well medium and large 
state-owned enterprises. In fact, many medium and large 
state-owned enterprises in Inner Mongolia are functioning quite 
well, and we need to summarize and popularize these enterprises' 
experiences. However, for various reasons, quite a few 
enterprises in Inner Mongolia are encountering difficulties in 
their operations. The autonomous regional government is 
responsible for helping them. Enterprises must depend on 
themselves as well and make efforts to transform their operating 
mechanisms to gradually extricate themselves from their 
predicaments. Inner Mongolia is blessed with rich natural 
resources. As Inner Mongolia's economy develops, its strong 
point in natural resources is playing a more and more important 
role in economic development. Under the leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and with 
the concerted efforts of ethnic cadres and masses, there is a 
great hope that Inner Mongolia will vigorously develop its 
economy. 
  Li Peng stressed: People of various nationalities in Inner 
Mongolia are united. China is a multinational country, and 
unity between all nationalities is a very important prerequisite 
for our efforts in all fields. I hope that the Inner Mongolian 
Autonomous Region will further cultivate the favorable state of 
unity between nationalities to make all peoples prosperous. 
  In accompanying Premier Li Peng in inspecting Inner 
Mongolia, 
Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister in charge of the 
State Nationalities Affairs Commission, said after hearing the 
work reports: People of all nationalities in China are equal 
and united. They cooperate with one another and make progress 
together. In view of the protracted and complicated nature of 
ethnic problems, we must always attach great importance to 
maintaining unity between all nationalities to create favorable 
social environment for China's reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. He added emphatically: To strengthen national 
unity, we must fully depend on cadres and masses of all 
nationalities. People of all nationalities must consider 
safeguarding the reunification of the motherland and national 
unity as citizens' legal and moral duty. We must promptly and 
efficiently resolve inner contradictions between people of all 
nat)onalities accordi.g to the law. Cadres of all nationalities 
at various levels must take the lead in safeguarding the 
reunification of the motherland and unity between all 
nationalities. We must vigorously develop the economy and 
social undertakings in regions inhabited by minority peoples to 
continuously strengthen the economic foundation for unity of all 
nationalities. 
  While inspecting Inner Mongolia, Premier Li Peng was also 
accompanied by Ye Qing, Han Shubin, Yao Zhenyan, Wang Mengkui, 
and Jiang Yunbao, who are responsible persons from relevant 
departments of the State Council.

  [Text] Managua, May 4 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
President Li Teng-hui said here Wednesday [4 May] that his 
country will continue helping Nicaragua in its push for economic 
development. 
  Li made the pledge when meeting his Nicaraguan counterpart, 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, shortly after Li's arrival in 
Nicaragua Wednesday afternoon for a two-day official visit. 
  Chamorro expressed her heartfelt thanks to Li for Taiwan's 
assistance in Nicaragua's economic reconstruction. In return, 
Li thanked Chamorro for Nicaraguan support of the ROC's bid to 
gain a seat in the United Nations. 
  Nicaragua is one of Taiwan's seven Latin American allies 
that 
together submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, asking the United Nations to put the ROC's UN bid 
on the agenda for the 48th General Assembly last September. The 
request was voted down. 
  Li and Chamorro also exchanged a wide range of views on 
issues of mutual concern. Raymond Tai, spokesman for the 
Presidential Office, said the meeting was held in a "friendly 
atmosphere." 
  Li stressed in a welcoming reception held in his honor later 
in the day that the ROC is willing to share its successful 
"Taiwan experience" with Nicaragua. 
  The first ROC-Nicaraguan ministerial meeting was also held 
Wednesday, during which Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal 
Sanchez vowed to continue to support the ROC politically, saying 
there is no reason to continue keeping Taiwan and the 21 million 
people in Taiwan out of the UN. 
  Attending the meeting on Taiwan's side were Foreign Affairs 
Minister Chien Fu, Central Bank of China Governor Samuel C. 
Shieh, council for economic planning and development chairman 
Hsiao Wan-chang, Executive Yuan adviser Jeffrey Koo, and Tai, 
who is also vice presidential secretary-general. 
  The second ministerial meeting will be held Thursday, during 
which an extradition treaty, bilateral economic cooperation and 
Taiwan investment in Nicaragua will be discussed. 
  A joint communique will be issued on Thursday before Li 
leaves Managua for Costa Rica, where he will attend the 
inaugural ceremony for Costa Rican President-Elect Jose Maria 
Figueres on Sunday.

  [Text] Managua, May 5 (CNA) -- Jose Evenor Taboada, 
governor of the Nicaraguan Central Bank said Thursday [5 May] 
that the Taiwan experience serves as a strong model for 
Nicaragua to follow. Evenor made the comment after meeting with 
Central Bank of China Governor Samuel Shieh. 
  During the meeting, Shieh briefed Evenor and other 
Nicaraguan 
officials on Taiwan's economic development over the past four 
decades. 
  Shieh said Taiwan has developed from an agricultural economy 
with a per capita income of US$100 to a high-tech, export 
oriented economy with per capita income topping US$10,000. He 
added that Taiwan performed its "economic miracle" by 
concentrating on the development of labor-intensive light 
industry, and switching to technology-intensive industries once 
a strong industrial base had been built. 
  Shieh advised Evenor to take economic development slowly and 
stressed the importance of education in making the transition 
from an agricultural to industrial economy.

  [Text] Managua, Nicaragua, May 5 (CNA) -- Republic of 
China [ROC] President Li Teng-hui and Nicaraguan President 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro signed a joint communique here 
Thursday [5 May] reaffirming their determination to promote 
bilateral cooperation. 
  Chamorro said in the communique that President Li's visit 
has 
ushered in a new era in relations between the Republic of China 
and Nicaragua. Li is the first ROC president to visit Nicaragua 
and Latin America. 
  Chamorro said she appreciates the assistance the ROC has 
given to her country over the past years. "We hope the ROC will 
continue encouraging its businessmen to invest in Nicaragua to 
help boost our economic development," Chamorro said. 
  She also pledged continued Nicaraguan support for the ROC's 
bid to join the United Nations. "The 21 million residents of 
Taiwan are entitled to be represented in the world body," 
Chamorro said. Moreover, she added, Taiwan's economic strength 
should not be ignored. 
  President Li lauded Chamorro for her outstanding 
achievements 
in leading Nicaragua towards a stable, reliable environment for 
economic development. 
  Li also thanked Chamorro for her firm support for the ROC's 
UN bid. Chamorro twice spoke in the UN General Assembly in 1992 
and 1993 to support Taiwan's entry to the world body. 
  Li said the ROC will continue collaborating with 
international financial organizations to provide financing for 
major Nicaraguan economic development projects. In 1993, the 
ROC and the Inter-American Development Bank offered a US$30 
million syndicated loan to assist Nicaragua's agricultural 
reforms. 
  Li said the ROC will encourage its state-run and 
privately-owned enterprises to invest in Nicaragua and help 
boost the development of small and medium-sized industries in 
the Central American country. 
  Earlier in the day, the Nicaraguan National Assembly 
conferred on Li the Order of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro with Grand 
Cross in recognition of his contributions in producing 
understanding and friendship between the two countries. 
  Luis Humberto Guzman, president of the Nicaraguan Assembly, 
said Li was the fourth recipient of the honor. President 
Chamorro was the first recipient of the order, which was named 
after her late husband. Spanish King Juan Carlos and former 
Venezuelan President Carlos Andrez Perez also received the order. 
  Following the decoration ceremony, Li delivered a speech to 
the Nicaraguan congress. Li said he noticed that the people in 
Nicaragua are friendly and kind and live in a society full of 
vitality. He also lauded the Assembly for its role in promoting 
reforms and development in Nicaragua. 
  Li arrived in Managua Wednesday for a three-day state visit. 
Nicaragua is the first leg of Li's two-week four-country tour 
which will also take him to Costa Rica, South Africa and 
Swaziland. Li will leave here Friday for Costa Rica, where he 
will attend the inauguration of president-elect Jose Maria 
Figueres scheduled for Sunday.

  [Text] Taipei, May 5 (CNA) -- The remarks by a Japanese 
cabinet member that the "rape of Nanking" was a "fabrication" 
and that Japan was not an aggressor in World War II triggered 
indignation and protests across Taiwan Thursday [5 May]. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commenting on Japanese 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remarks made in an interview 
published in the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Wednesday, said the Republic 
of China [ROC] Government "feels sorry and is indignant" about 
the remarks. 
  "We strongly protest against what Nagano said about the 
massacre in Nanking, which is an apparent distortion of history 
and has abused the feelings of all Chinese," the ministry said 
in a statement. 
  In the quoted remarks, Nagano said Japan's aim during the 
war 
was to free Asian nations from European colonialism. "It is 
wrong to say the war was a war of aggression," he was quoted as 
saying. "We thought seriously about the liberation of colonies, 
to liberate a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." 
  Li Shou-kong, a retired professor in contemporary history at 
National Taiwan University, said the 1937 Nanjing massacre, in 
which at least 300,000 residents in the southern Chinese city 
were slaughtered, was a fact that could not be denied or 
whitewashed. "The only part of the tragedy that remains open to 
speculation is the number of the residents actually killed," Li 
added. 
  "As a matter of fact, the Japanese militarists killed and 
sexually abused the innocent victims in China not only in 
Nanking but widely and predatorily in many parts of the 
country," he said. 
  Japan whipped up a wave of anger in Taiwan, Mainland China, 
Korea, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia some 10 years ago by 
whitewashing in student textbooks its aggression in World War 
II. After that incident, the Japanese Education Ministry sent 
two officials to Taiwan to make apologies, Li said. 
  Meanwhile, Kuomintang [KMT] legislators, at an emergency 
interpellation session, demanded that Japan make public once 
again the truths surrounding the massacre in Nanking and Japan's 
behavior in Mainland China and other parts of Asia during the 
war. They also demanded an explanation for Nagano's remarks. 
  KMT legislator Wei Young called for close attention to be 
paid to the positions of new-generation Japanese politicians and 
their attempts at historical revisionism. He claimed that 
Nagano's statement on the issue was not an isolated incident. 
  Wei refuted Nagano's remarks about Japan's intention to 
liberate a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as "absolutely 
unjustifiable." 
  He said Taiwan should demand across-the-board war 
reparations 
from Japan.

  [Text] Taipei, May 6 (CNA) -- The rubber and plastics 
industry tops the list of Taiwan industries which have relocated 
to Mainland China, followed by the electrical and electronic 
equipment industry, according to Ministry of Economic Affairs 
statistics. 
  The statistics showed that total rubber and plastics 
industry 
investment in Mainland China hit US$613.73 million in March, 
accounting for 16 percent of the total value of all relocated 
industries. 
  The electrical and electronic equipment industry ranked 
second with US$537 million, or 14 percent, and the food and 
beverage industry came in third with US$421 million, or 11 
percent, the statistics showed. 
  The metal industry came in fourth with 9 percent, and the 
chemical and textile industries tied for fifth with 6 percent 
each. The wood products industry had 4 percent, the fashion and 
paper industries each recorded 3 percent and machine and leather 
goods each accounted for 2 percent of total investment, the 
statistics showed. 
  The industrial value of products produced in Mainland China 
by Taiwan manufacturers has posted an average 8-12 fold growth 
since 1993, that statistics showed. Taiwan industries began a 
mass relocation to the mainland in the same year. 
  Taiwan's labor-intensive industries began a relocation to 
Mainland China in 1987 due to rising labor and land costs here.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Xia Yuhua (1115 0060 5478)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 6 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The Foreign 
Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament recommended 
in a report released last month, that a human rights commission 
be set up in Hong Kong. Lu Ping, vice chairman and secretary 
general of the Preliminary Work Committee and director of the 
State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, pointed out 
here today that setting up a human rights commission clashes 
with the Basic Law. 
  In a discussion meeting with National People's Congress Hong 
Kong deputies and Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference Hong Kong members, Lu Ping said: This commission, as 
they see it, will not be a normal consultative body but a body 
of power. Yet it is neither an executive, or legislative, or a 
judiciary organ as laid down in the Basic Law. Setting up such 
a human rights commission obviously clashes with the Basic Law 
and will undermine the power structure established by the Basic 
Law. 
  Lu Ping believed that the people recommending such a human 
rights commission "had some other things in mind." As a power 
body, the human rights commission is bound to weaken and affect 
the powers of other bodies and destabilize Hong Kong society. 
  As regards the proposition that after 1997 the Chinese 
Government should report periodically to the UN Human Rights 
Commission on the human rights situation in Hong Kong, Lu Ping 
said: As China did not join either of the two international 
human rights conventions, it does not have any responsibility or 
obligation to report to the UN Human Rights Commission on human 
rights in Hong Kong. 
  Lu Ping said: Hong Kong is not a polity and does not have 
the authority to make reports to the UN Human Rights Commission. 
The Basic Law states very clearly: The parts in the two human 
rights conventions that have been applicable to Hong Kong in the 
past must, after 1997, be implemented through the local laws of 
Hong Kong. In other words, the two human rights conventions 
cannot be directly applied to Hong Kong. There was consensus on 
this point when the Basic Law was drafted. 
  Lu Ping said that Hong Kong people will enjoy extensive 
rights after 1997 and the Basic Law provides full legal 
safeguards in this respect. 
  During the discussion, Lu Ping characterized the Foreign 
Affairs Select Committee's report as "very good teaching 
material" because it bluntly admitted a fundamental change in 
Britain's 1989 policy on the problem of Hong Kong from 
cooperating with to confronting the Chinese Government.

  [Text] Good evening. China's top official dealing with 
Hong Kong affairs has been offering reassuring words about the 
future to local businessmen. But Lu Ping also says that the 
territory is only a value to China if it doesn't become too 
political. That message has not gone down well in some 
quarters, as Linda Lee reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Lee] Addressing some 500 local 
businessmen over lunch today, Lu Ping stressed that the value of 
Hong Kong to China has been and will be economic. 
  [Lu Ping] Of course, there are always a handful who are so 
naive as to think that they can turn Hong Kong into a political 
city in order to influence the mainland in the sense of 
politics. If that were the case, Hong Kong would be of negative 
value instead of positive value to China. 
  [Patten] I don't think that you can treat Hong Kong as 
though 
it were just an economic laboratory. It is a living and 
thriving community with all sorts of social and political 
aspirations. [end recording] 
  [Lee] Governor Patten had made himself readily available to 
respond to any comment from Lu Ping by scheduling a visit to 
Tsing Yi this afternoon. He reminded the Chinese officials that 
they were party to a promise to give Hong Kong greater democracy. 
  [Patten] China itself has signed up in the Joint Declaration 
and in the Basic Law to a process of political development in 
Hong Kong, which recognizes the modest but growing aspirations 
of the people of the community. 
  [Lee] But Lu Ping pointed out that the principles of One 
Country, Two Systems and Hong Kong People Ruling Hong Kong were 
designed to meet the aspirations of the community. Lu assured 
his audience that the territory will enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Zhang Junsheng Suggests Three Ways To </F>
Increase Hong Kong People's Understanding of PLA"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 1 May (TA KUNG PAO)--Zhang Junsheng, 
deputy director of XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, said here today that 
increasing mutual understanding between Hong Kong people in all 
walks of life and the People's Liberation Army [PLA] will be 
conducive to communication between PLA troops stationed in Hong 
Kong after 1997 and local residents. 
  Zhang joined a number of Hong Kong deputies to the National 
People's Congress [NPC] and other Hong Kong celebrities in 
visiting the troops of Guangzhou Military Region. When asked by 
reporters after the visit, Zhang expressed the following opinion. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: This visit to the Guangzhou Military 
Region was an activity enabling the residents of Hong Kong to 
know the PLA better. Today's military show was superb. This 
time, the leaders, officers, and soldiers of the Guangzhou unit 
very warmly and thoughtfully received the visiting NPC deputiess 
and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference National Committee from Hong Kong, members of the 
Preparatory Working Committee, and Hong Kong affairs advisers. 
  A reporter asked: Will the press be able to cover this type 
of news in the future? Zhang Junsheng said: "We shall try by 
every possible means to enable Hong Kong people from all walks 
of life to come into contact with the PLA and understand the 
PLA, and this will include our friends in the mass media. 
However, it is not easy to arrange such visits." 
  Another reporter asked: Will visits to the PLA barracks help 
remove Hong Kong people's misgivings about the PLA? Zhang 
Junsheng said: "If Hong Kong people have misgivings, this is 
just a misunderstanding. The people's Army is a strong force 
for defending our country. Without the PLA, how could we be 
able to conduct national reconstruction in a peaceful 
environment, and how could we live peacefully?" 
  He stressed: If there is such a misunderstanding, then it is 
necessary to remove it by increasing understanding of the PLA. 
First, it is necessary to know about the fine traditions and 
history of the PLA. Second, there are many news reports about 
the PLA on the mainland. Third, in the future, more Hong Kong 
people from various social circles, including journalists, will 
be organized to come into contact with the PLA. This will all 
be conducive to communication between PLA troops stationed in 
Hong Kong after 1997 and local residents.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] It is difficult to escape the conclusion that a 
major reason for the display of military prowess in Guangzhou 
last weekend was to strike fear into the hearts of "anti-Chinese 
elements" in Hong Kong. The demonstration of daredevil combat 
skills by the crack Red One Brigade before a select Hong Kong 
audience was a show of force by the sovereign power just a 
little shy of three years before takeover. 
  Xinhua and the pro-Beijing press claimed the parade would 
enable Hong Kong citizens to know more about the People's 
Liberation Army (PLA). As the propagandists put it: "It was 
the first time since nation building that Hong Kong compatriots 
took a close look at PLA troops in an organised and large-scale 
fashion." 
  Not highlighted was the fact that the exhibition was open to 
only 216 of the faithful: Beijing-appointed legislators and 
advisers as well as members of the "shadow Government". The 
press were barred, as were Hong Kong's elected legislators. 
  More important, however, is the fact that Hong Kong has 
prospered precisely because its residents have not needed to be 
anywhere near the PLA. At the height of the 1967 
"disturbances", the Hong Kong Government kept a fleet of 
airplanes at Kai Tak on a 24-hour standby basis. An emergency 
airlift would take place the moment the PLA crossed the border. 
  Even for moderate cadres of the Chinese Communist Party 
(CCP), however, the stationing of the PLA in Hong Kong -- not to 
mention holding periodic war games to scare "domestic and 
foreign hostile elements" in the territory -- makes little 
sense. The Special Administrative Region (SAR) is exposed to no 
danger of foreign invasion. 
  The late premier Zhou Enlai and politburo member Liao 
Chengzhi who held the Hong Kong portfolio in the 60s and 70s -- 
did not favour posting troops to Hong Kong. Messrs Zhou and 
Liao's idea about the change of sovereignty was as minimalist as 
it was liberal: Just change the governor and the flag. 
  Former defence minister Geng Biao and former foreign 
minister 
Huang Hua also opposed billeting soldiers here. After they told 
the press about it, however, the two were in 1983 given a public 
scolding by patriarch Deng Xiaoping for "mouthing nonsense". 
  Yet even Mr. Deng envisaged no more than a token PLA 
presence. 
  With the onset of the moral equivalent of war between 
Beijing 
and Governor Chris Patten and the "neo-imperialists", however, 
the 8,000 to 10,000 soldiers who will call Hong Kong home after 
July 1997 have much more than symbolic significance. 
  Top brass briefing the Hong Kong dignitaries last weekend 
reiterated that the troops would not interfere with SAR affairs. 
Xinhua Vice-Director Zhang Junsheng made much of the fact that 
since "the PLA are the people's army, the sons and brothers of 
the people, Hong Kong compatriots have nothing to fear". 
  Almost the same words were used to assure Beijing residents 
as the CCP's Central Military Commission (CMC) moved troops into 
the capital in May 1989. During last weekend's exercise, the 
216 luminaries were so awestruck by the display of brawn and 
electronic wizardry they did nothing other than sing praises 
over "this civilised battalion, this glorious battalion." 
  Cooler heads, however, should ask themselves -- and the PLA 
-- the following questions. 
  First, on the issue of loyalty. The troops to be quartered 
here will be under the "absolute leadership" of the CCP and the 
CMC. 
  There have been no fully-fledged coups d'etat in Communist- 
Chinese history. But during the Cultural Revolution and the 
"turmoil" in the spring of 1989, the PLA responded with alacrity 
to calls by the CMC to "restore order". 
  It is not very likely that the SAR -- or a "destabilising" 
political force within the Region -- will lock horns with the 
CCP administration. 
  Hong Kong, however, has been characterised by Chinese cadres 
as a "base of subversion". Should an ugly confrontation shape 
up, Beijing would no doubt ensure that, to use PLA lingo, "the 
guns of the soldiers (here) will be pointed in the right 
direction". 
  Then there is the degree of effectiveness with which the CMC 
can control troops in Guangdong and in the SAR in the post-Deng 
era. 
  It is a reflection of Beijing's concern for "warlordism" 
that, to quell the 1989 "rebellion", the CMC mobilised divisions 
to the capital from all the military regions. Likewise, the 
soldiers destined to "guard" Hong Kong will come from different 
parts of the nation. 
  Should CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin fail to hold together the 
army after Mr. Deng's demise, officers in the Guangzhou and the 
Hong Kong command might not heed the centre's instructions about 
what not to do to the SAR. 
  Because Hong Kong is such a fat piece of meat, ferocious 
argument has also broken out within the top brass over which PLA 
unit and faction should have the choicest parts of the spoils. 
  It is understood that the CMC had to invoke Mr. Deng's 
authority to shoot down a proposal by the navy that it erect 
major installations in the SAR. The leadership was worried that 
the business viability of the SAR would be hurt if a chunk of it 
became a naval base. 
  The power struggle within the CCP and the CMC, however, is a 
never-ending game. The PLA faction that comes out on top two 
years after Mr. Deng's death may have a radically different idea 
not only on troop deployment here, but on other aspects in which 
Hong Kong can serve the motherland's Great Wall of Steel. 
  The Basic Law notwithstanding, the SAR will not be able to 
say "no" to the propositions of the single most powerful 
institution in China. 
  Then there is the question of the PLA's mushrooming business 
empire. Hong Kong has resigned itself to the fact that the PLA 
will reap billions of dollars from developing the huge plots of 
land which will be turned over to them by the departing British 
garrison. 
  Much more disturbing is the phenomenon of PLA companies 
using 
their unbeatable clout to muscle into -- and corner parts of -- 
the Hong Kong market. 
  Quite a number of generals tipped for the Hong Kong Command, 
including the Head of the Political Department of the Guangzhou 
Military Region, Lei Mingqiu, are accomplished military 
entrepreneurs. 
  On the mainland, PLA companies wheel and deal outside the 
law 
because, in most instances, they are outside the purview of 
civilian departments in areas such as customs, auditing, 
taxation and anticorruption. 
  There is no suggestion that army businesses operating in 
Hong 
Kong after 1997 will make a point of breaking SAR laws. Yet 
given the feverish anxiety with which political and business 
circles in Hong Kong are currying favour with power sects from 
up north, it would be that much easier for errant PLA executives 
to get away with shady transactions.

  [Text] Yesterday morning, nearly 300 Hong Kong-based 
National People's Congress [NPC] deputies, Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference National Committee members, 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Preliminary Work 
Committee members, and Hong Kong affairs advisers, as well as 
some other patriotic figures -- including Henry Fok Ying-tung, 
Lu Ping, Zhou Nan, Li Chushan, and Yang Yanying -- arrived at a 
certain barracks of the Guangzhou Military Region [GMR], where 
they watched a drill staged by the GMR Reconnaissance Unit. 
They were accompanied by GMR Political Commissar Shi Yuxiao, 
and some other officers. 
  The Hong Kong compatriots warmly applauded the officers and 
soldiers, who staged excellent performances for them. They 
praised the People's Liberation Army [PLA] as a strong and 
civilized army that is politically qualified and militarily 
competent, as an army with a fine style and a strong sense of 
discipline, and as an army with effective logistical support. 
They praised the officers and soldiers, who staged excellent 
performances for them, as officers and soldiers of iron and 
steel. The Hong Kong compatriots said: After seeing the PLA, we 
now can set our minds at rest. 
  When the military drill was over, Mr Henry Fok Ying-tung, on 
behalf of the nearly 300 compatriots who had watched the 
military drill, presented a souvenir to the reconnaissance unit. 
Mr Henry Fok Ying-tung also wrote the following inscription for 
the reconnaissance unit: "Soldiers of Iron and Steel."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Lu's Visit Need Not Be a Waste"] </F>
  [Text] Let's face it, the visit to Hong Kong by Lu Ping, 
director of China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, has been 
a public relations disaster. We can all live with public 
relations disasters, but it is more difficult to live with the 
underlying cause of the problem. 
  There are no prizes for identifying the source of this 
problem. It lies in the paralysis of leadership which afflicts 
China as the leaders of the Communist Party mount their morbid 
deathbed watch over paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. 
  In these circumstances no one aspiring to high office in 
China dares put a toe out of place. They are all waiting and 
watching to see what will happen in the post-Deng era. Not 
surprisingly, Lu Ping is also affected by this climate of 
uncertainty and probably assumes that a low profile is the only 
profile worth adopting. 
  Chinese bureaucrats are rarely punished for doing nothing, 
but any positive action carries the risk of retribution. Were 
Lu to take the relatively bold step of publicly restoring 
relations with Governor Chris Patten, he may well expose himself 
to all manner of criticism. Far safer is the option of never 
venturing beyond the walls of Chinese-owned premises and never 
meeting anyone likely to say anything critical about Chinese 
government policy. 
  We have a sneaking suspicion this must be extremely 
frustrating for an intelligent man like Lu Ping, who is well 
aware of the limitations of his current position but is 
seemingly incapable of doing anything about it. It is too much 
to expect Lu to suddenly perform an about-face and trot along to 
Government House for tea, biscuits and a chat with the Governor. 
Even less likely is the prospect of a quick yum cha [tea and 
dim sum] with Martin Lee and his fellow democrats. 
  Yet there is an opportunity to snatch victory from the jaws 
of defeat. Lu can use his presence in Hong Kong to work behind 
the scenes and give a much-needed kick up the backside to the 
many matters stuck in the logjam of stalled Sino-British 
negotiations. 
  Where to start? There is so much to be done. Maybe it would 
be best to focus on the obvious. Shrieking out loud is the need 
for an agreement on financing for the new airport. This could 
literally be settled in a day of talks, given goodwill on both 
sides and bearing in mind the issue has been so comprehensively 
discussed. Neither side has an excuse for holding out for more 
information. 
  Then there is the equally pressing matter of the ninth 
container terminal which appears to have retreated entirely from 
the public view. 
  Also on the wish list of things which need to be done 
urgently are arrangements for the future of the civil service. 
There is nothing so demoralising as uncertainty. So, if the 
Special Administrative Region wishes to inherit a demoralised 
civil service, they are doing everything in their power to 
guarantee such an eventuality. 
  Uncertainty also hangs heavily over the future of the legal 
system, given the lack of agreement on the formation of the 
Court of Final Appeal. Everyone says Hong Kong's legal system 
underpins the stability of our society. This, then, is clearly 
a matter of some importance and should not be allowed to fester. 
  Aside from specific things which need to be done, the very 
least Lu can do is ensure the orderly resumption of regular 
meetings between representatives of the Chinese and British 
governments. The brutal fact of the matter is that for the past 
five years these meetings have been erratic and largely 
unproductive. 
  In the unlikely event that Lu could secure progress on all 
these fronts, he would be doing no more than ensuring the 
progress of business as usual. In other words, these are modest 
aspirations, delivered in circumstances where even modest 
expectations remain unfulfilled. 
  Patten, for his part, has something important to contribute 
to the process of removing the logjam. He should immediately 
lift the ban on civil servants having dealings with China's 
Preliminary Working Committee. This may well be emerging as a 
pale imitation of a shadow government and may also be designed 
to undermine the authority of the current administration, but it 
is a reality in Hong Kong's emerging power structure. No harm 
can be done by recognising this and providing its members with 
full access to the civil service. Once the ban is removed China 
will be deprived of yet another excuse for not re-establishing 
normal relations with the Hong Kong government. 
  Waiting two years before returning to Hong Kong, Lu Ping has 
only himself to blame for creating exaggerated expectations of 
what his visit can achieve. Were he to be a regular visitor to 
the territory, his presence would cause less of a stir. It 
would be so easy to throw away every opportunity to make 
progress on the arrangements for Hong Kong's transfer to Chinese 
sovereignty. It would come as more than just a pleasant 
surprise if the temptation to throw away yet another opportunity 
was resisted.

  [Text] Deng Xiaoping may not live to fulfil his wish to 
visit Hong Kong after 1997, but his younger brother, Deng Ken, 
86, will have a glimpse of the territory well before the 
handover of sovereignty. Deng Ken will visit Hong Kong on 
Sunday for five days at the invitation of Lo Yuk-sui, the 
chairman of the Paliburg Group. Deng Ken's visit will be private 
and low-profile. 
  Guided by Lo, he will visit the Po Lin Buddha on Lantau 
Island, the Peak, Ocean Park, the Bank of China headquarters and 
a few tourist spots in the New Territories. He will stay in a 
VIP room at the Regal Hotel in Causeway Bay, which is controlled 
by Paliburg. He will also pay a courtesy call on local New China 
News Agency (Xinhua) officials. 
  No politics will be discussed and he will not meet any 
members of the Preliminary Working Group, Hong Kong affairs 
advisers or Hong Kong delegates to the National People's 
Congress. Nor will he meet the Governor, Chris Patten. Lo is 
arranging a dinner in Deng Ken's honour for a number of 
prominent local personalities. 
  Considerably taller than his brother, the younger Deng has a 
much lower profile in China. A former reporter and former 
vice-governor of Hubei province, Deng Ken is regarded as the 
most intellectual of Deng Xiaoping's seven brothers and sisters. 
  His stopover in Hong Kong will come after a tour of 
Singapore. 
  It is understood that he is being accompanied by a close - 
associate, Yu Zhian, the general director of China Chang Jiang 
Energy Group, which has an association with Lo's Paliburg. 
Paliburg signed an agreement with Chang Jiang Power in March 
this year to pursue an electricity generating joint venture. 
The agreement has paved the way for further investment 
opportunities for Lo's group in China. 
  Unlike Deng Xiaoping's off-spring, Deng Ken has not visited 
Hong Kong before. Deng Xiaoping's three daughters and two sons 
have been frequent visitors to Hong Kong. Deng Rong, one of 
Deng's daughters, came to Hong Kong last September.

Commentary on Report by the British Foreign Affairs Select 
Committee"] 
  [Text] Perhaps because the British Foreign Affairs Select 
Committee had defended and commended him in its report, "Chris 
Patten is very satisfied with his job as governor of Hong Kong" 
and claims that he "will continue to be the governor of Hong 
Kong until 30 June 1997." 
  The report, which runs into tens of thousands of words, 
devotes a large portion to the defense of Chris Patten's 
erroneous policy, praising him for "correctly choosing a path 
which seeks to satisfy the demands of Hong Kong people" and 
indicating its full support for him. The authors of the report 
can be said to be Chris Patten's defense counsels. 
  The report describes the "assumption of the post of governor 
of Hong Kong by Chris Patten, a former government minister with 
cabinet duties" as a "most significant change in Hong Kong." 
  What have been the "changes" since Chris Patten arrived in 
Hong Kong? The following, briefly stated, are some of the 
notable changes: From the outset, he refused to discuss and 
cooperate with China and took a course of confrontation--this 
was the first change. He initiated great changes to the 
political system, produced a political reform package in 
contravention of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 
principle of corresponding to the Basic Law, and agreements and 
understandings between China and Britain--this was the second 
change. Throughout the negotiations, he kept on disrupting and 
undermining the talks between China and Britain on Hong Kong's 
1994/95 electoral arrangements with a double-faced 
approach--this was the third change. He spoke of Hong Kong as 
an "international asset" and visited the United States, Canada, 
Australia, Japan, and Western Europe to beg the international 
community for intervention in Hong Kong's affairs--this was the 
fourth change. He supported legal revisions and formulated new 
policies in order to sow dissension between civil servants and 
Hong Kong citizens, divide the Hong Kong people, and create 
disturbances--this was the fifth change. He distorted some 
criminal cases which China has handled according to law in an 
attempt to arouse discontent with the Chinese Government and 
foster "anxiety" about the future in the people--this was the 
sixth change. 
  That such changes could be lauded by the report as "most 
significant changes" indicates well how much Britain's policy 
has changed toward China. 
  As is well known, over the last few years, the British 
Government has changed its China policy on the basis of a 
completely erroneous assessment of the situation in China. It 
is against this background that Chris Patten came to Hong Kong 
to carry out Britain's mistaken policy. His point of departure, 
therefore, was "change," turning cooperation into confrontation 
and stability into turmoil. The core of his actions were 
"unilateral moves" to make key changes to the current political 
system in order to prolong Britain's control over Hong Kong 
after 1997. 
  All of the changes made by Chris Patten in Hong Kong have 
violated agreements between China and Britain, worked against 
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and impeded Hong Kong's 
steady transition. But the report tried its best to look for 
"grounds" for Chris Patten's "changes." 
  "Ground" one: "The Joint Declaration does not require that 
all things remain unchanged between 1984 and 1997." 
  Here, let us pose a question to the authors of the report: 
Does the Joint Declaration demand that Britain change the 
current political system during the transition? Nowhere in the 
Joint Declaration and its annexes is Britain given the power to 
greatly change the political system. The theme running through 
the document is one of "keeping unchanged." There are more than 
20 instances of "retain," "maintain," "continue," and so on, 
which are all aimed at safeguarding Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity and a smooth transition. It is also a responsibility 
placed by the Joint Declaration on China and Britain. This 
defense by the report is obviously awkward. 
  "Ground" two: "The provisions of the Basic Law are at 
present not legally binding on the Hong Kong Government." 
  This statement is clear in its connotation, namely, that 
there is no need to take the Basic Law into account in actions 
taken by Chris Patten before 1997 to change the political 
system. But since the British Hong Kong government is not bound 
by the Basic Law, why does Chris Patten keep explaining that his 
"political reform package" corresponds with and does not violate 
the Basic Law? Why did the report, following Chris Patten, say 
that "our legally sworn witnesses, our governor, and the British 
Government hold that absolutely nothing in the proposals made by 
the Hong Kong governor is inconsistent with the provisions of 
the Basic Law?" It is cheating to say that Chris Patten's 
package "corresponds with the Basic Law" and "is absolutely not 
inconsistent with the provisions of the Basic Law." The truth 
is that the package violated the principle of corresponding with 
the Basic Law. Because Chris Patten never wanted to be "bound" 
by the Basic Law and was willing to work only under the "Letters 
Patent" and the "Royal Instructions." Unexpectedly, the report 
revealed the truth. 
  "Ground" three: "The British government and the Hong Kong 
authorities are not legally obliged to stop Chris Patten's 
proposals from being implemented before 1997." 
  This gives them away again. Chris Patten is above the 
British Hong Kong Government and is in a supreme position, which 
is a power given by the British Queen. Therefore, the Hong Kong 
authorities have no means (or it should be said "have no 
intention") of stopping him from carrying out his package. It 
is easy to understand. And it shows that there is only 
dictatorship and no genuine democracy in Hong Kong at the 
present time. What we do not understand is who is commanding 
who -- the British Government or Chris Patten? Can it be Chris 
Patten who is commanding the British Government? The "Letters 
Patent" expressly stipulate that the "governor obeys the rules, 
ordinances, and rulings in the Letters Patent in making laws." 
Since Chris Patten's package received the "full support" of the 
British Government, why did the report say that the British 
Government is not legally obliged to stop Chris Patten from 
carrying out his package? Are they not shooting themselves in 
the foot? 
  This was a slick move that backfired! The authors of the 
report, in intending to prove the correctness of Chris Patten 
with these "grounds," end up showing that his policy is wrong. 
This is something they probably did not expect!

<F P=106> ["Random Notes on Hong Kong" column article by Lian Tian </F>
(6647 1131): "Joining Efforts To Make a Bigger Cake"] 
  [Text] Through painstaking preparations, the new Hong Kong 
banknotes issued by the Bank of China [BOC] are now available to 
Hong Kong inhabitants. This is a major event in Hong Kong 
economic circles. 
  According to an authoritative figure from the BOC, as a 
commercial bank, the BOC has issued Hong Kong banknotes in an 
orderly way according to local laws and current Hong Kong 
regulations for issuing currency. Moreover, after becoming a 
banknote issuer, the BOC will continue its operation in light of 
Hong Kong's financial laws, continue to support the status of 
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard 
Chartered Bank as Hong Kong's major banknote issuers. The BOC 
intends to enter into fair competition with other banks in Hong 
Kong and seek common development rather than replace them. Hong 
Kong people should set their minds at ease. As stated by an 
official in charge of the BOC: "We do not intend to take a 
larger share of the cake. Instead, we want to join others in 
making a bigger cake." As the second largest bank group in Hong 
Kong, the BOC in Hong Kong has always regarded the maintenance 
of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and Hong Kong's status 
as an international financial center as its fundamental 
interests. 
  From the BOC's issuance of banknotes in Hong Kong, we can 
see 
the great significance of the move in Hong Kong's economy. 
Apart from consolidating Hong Kong's status as an international 
financial center, it will also be conducive to the continuity 
and smooth transition of Hong Kong's currency system. Hong Kong 
is one of the limited number of regions in the world where 
banknotes are issued by commercial banks, where there is no 
central bank, and where the functions of the central bank are 
jointly performed by the government departments, the Hong Kong 
and Shanghai Banking Corporation, and other commercial banks. 
Following the issuance of its banknotes, the BOC will become a 
member of these commercial banks. The move itself shows that 
the system of commercial banks issuing banknotes, which has 
prevailed in Hong Kong over the years, will smoothly continue 
after 1997. It also indicates the policy of the Chinese 
Government toward Hong Kong, that is, keeping prevailing 
practice unchanged. 
  Second, it will be conducive to stability of the value and 
credibility of Hong Kong currency. The BOC is one of the large 
banks which ranks in the front of the list of world banks. With 
a solid foundation, the move of the BOC in issuing Hong Kong 
banknotes will be conducive to maintaining a strong Hong Kong 
dollar. The system of pegging Hong Kong dollar to the 
greenback, aimed at stabilizing Hong Kong's financial market and 
the economy as a whole, has played an important role. After 
becoming a banknote issuer, the BOC will show more concern for 
the system than in the past and make vigorous efforts to 
consciously maintain it. 
  The BOC cannot make any commercial benefit from issuing 
banknotes in Hong Kong. Conversely, it has to undertake for the 
cost of the operation. Proceeding from the overall situation of 
maintaining Hong Kong's financial stability, the BOC, in 
compliance with the request of Hong Kong society, has vigorously 
undertaken a greater responsibility and issued Hong Kong 
banknotes. We hope that the BOC will seek practical results 
rather than undeserved reputation, carefully manage its 
business, and join Hong Kong banks in making a bigger "cake."

June 1994"] 
  [Text] At a meeting of the general managers of the Bank of 
China [BOC] Group on 3 May in Hong Kong, BOC Board Chairman Wang 
Qiren announced on behalf of the general headquarters that Yang 
Ziling has been appointed director of the BOC Hong Kong and 
Macao Administration and that Huang Diyan is longer director of 
the administration. After completing hand-over procedures in 
May between the old and new directors, Yang Zilin will formally 
assume office on 1 June. 
  After announcing this appointment and dismissal circular,

Group's business have speedily developed under the leadership of 
the general headquarters, its institutions and employees have 
continuously increased, its management level has improved, and 
it has achieved good results and made remarkable achievements. 
The BOC Group has established a good image and reputation in 
society, its position has improved, and its influence is 
expanding. Huang Diyan will withdraw from the director's post 
because of age and will continue to work in Hong Kong as BOC 
deputy board chairman and as adviser to the BOC Hong Kong and 
Macao Administration so that he will make new contributions to 
the Hong Kong and Macao BOC Group's future development. 
  Yang Zilin, 49, graduated from university in July 1968. He 
joined the BOC in March 1972. He has been a researcher in the 
BOC International Financial Research Office, a representative of 
the BOC Representative Office in Tokyo, chief representative, 
deputy director, and director of this office, and general 
manager of the BOC Tokyo Branch. In August 1992 he was 
appointed BOC director and assistant to the BOC president. 
Since December 1993 he has been BOC managing director and 
assistant to the BOC president. An informed BOC source 
disclosed that Yang Zilin is familiar with international 
financial business, has rich experience in banking, and is in 
the prime of life. Under his leadership, the BOC Group will 
continue to show its vitality and thrive.

<F P=106> ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "The Xi Yang </F>
Case Should Not Be Linked With Politics"] 
  [Text] Dear Brother, 
  On 15 April, the Beijing Higher People's Court made a final 
judgment in the case of Hong Kong's MING PAO reporter Xi Yang 
stealing and spying on the state's banking and economic secrets, 
rejected Xi Yang's appeal, and maintained the 28 March verdict 
by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court, which sentenced Xi 
to 12 years imprisonment and deprived him of political rights 
for 2 years. In my opinion, the verdict is legal and just, and 
the penalty is accurately meted out. 
  Xi Yang was involved in a criminal case, which was not 
complicated. Regarding those who do not know the truth or the 
procedure of trial by the judicial departments, questions of one 
kind or the other are understandable. However, some people are 
trying to seize upon the incident to exaggerate matters and to 
link this purely criminal case to politics in an attempt to 
throw mud at China's judicial departments. They are confusing 
right and wrong by saying that the sentence meted out by China's 
judicial departments on Xi Yang according to law runs counter to 
the principle of freedom of the press. 
  As a matter of fact, punishing the crime of stealing secrets 
and protecting the freedom of reporters in gathering news are 
two things entirely different in nature. News, news gathering, 
and legality are entirely different from secrets, stealing, and 
illegality. We can judge this point from the crime committed by 
Xi Yang. During June and July of 1993, Xi Yang came to Beijing 
in the name of covering the Sino-British talks and the 
establishment of the Preliminary Work Committee for the 
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. People in this circle all know that Hong Kong reporters 
should first submit an application for gathering news on the 
mainland. As far as I know, neither the XINHUA Hong Kong branch 
nor the People's Bank of China [PBC] received any application 
from Xi Yang to cover news about the PBC. Neither did the bank 
assign its staffer, Tian Ye, to receive Xi Yang. When Xi Yang 
arrived in Beijing, he was not interested at all in the news he 
was allowed to cover. Instead, in light of the request of the 
person in charge of MING PAO, he instigated Tian Ye, deputy 
director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the PBC, to steal the 
state's banking and economic secrets, which included the sample 
of banknotes to be printed by China, the decision of the bank on 
bullion trading in the international market, and the plan of the 
bank on interest rate changes which had not yet been published. 
The document entitled "Explanations on Provisional Method for 
Foreign- Funded Financial Organizations To Engage in Renminbi 
Businesses" was labeled "confidential." Did Xi and Tian not 
know they were violating the law? "Did they 'trespass the 
forbidden zone' by mistake while covering news?" No. I learned 
from relevant departments that Xi and Tian were surreptitious 
during their involvement in these activities. They dared not 
meet at Tian Ye's office or at the Jianguo Hotel, where Xi Yang 
was staying. Instead, they met on street corners. To avoid 
public attention, they neither shook hands on meeting nor bid 
farewell on parting. If this was normal news coverage, why were 
they so furtive? Obviously, they had guilty consciences. 
Regarding this, Xi Yang admitted that "he knowingly violated 
the law." While engaged in these activities, he also said, he 
"only received instructions from MING PAO, but never got any 
approval from the departments concerned." "His lawless behavior 
has caused unnecessary losses to the country's economy and has 
interfered in the country's policy of macroeconomic regulation 
and control. As a Chinese citizen who had lived and worked in 
the country for years, he knew that the nature of his case was 
serious, as his lawless behavior incurred enormous losses to the 
state's interests." When the PBC was investigating the case of 
China's financial and economic secrets published in MING PAO, 
the newspaper urged Xi Yang on numerous occasions to return to 
Hong Kong as quickly as possible. This also proved that the 
official responsible for the newspaper clearly knew the nature 
of the case. Since Xi Yang and Tian Ye have violated the law, 
incurring serious economic losses to the state, it is absolutely 
necessary to mete out punishment against them according to the 
law. They deserve this punishment. Otherwise, how can we guard 
the sanctity of the law? 
  Since reform and opening up, China's relevant departments 
have enthusiastically welcomed news coverage by reporters from 
overseas -- including those from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao -- 
and have provided convenience and created conditions for their 
normal coverage. In 1993 alone, Hong Kong reporters came to 
China to cover news on more than 1,000 occasions. However, if a 
person violates the law, he must be punished according to the 
law, regardless of his status. As Xi Yang stole and spied on 
the state's financial and economic secrets, violating China's 
law, China's judicial organs have meted out his punishment 
according to the law. This is entirely a matter within China's 
sovereignty. 
  [Signed] Bao Xin, 18 April

  [Text] Hong Kong, 5 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Today, 
some media organizations received a notice from the Information 
Office of the mainland government, passed on by the personnel of 
the XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong Branch, which politely refused 
to grant some Hong Kong reporters who had "boycotted" 
news-gathering invitations permission to cover stories in 
Zhejiang this time. However, the notice also stated that the 
media organizations may send different reporters. Our reporter 
interviewed on this matter a staff member of the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch in charge of transmitting news-gathering 
applications to higher authorities. 
  The person interviewed said: In the past, local reporters 
accepted invitations or sponsorships from mainland officials for 
gathering news in China on a voluntary basis and it was 
perfectly all right for them to decline the invitations. But 
this time, the problem is not just rejecting invitations, but 
also that they publicly "boycotted" the invitations and sent a 
signed statement to several departments of the Chinese 
Government. Under such circumstances, it would be very hard for 
the mainland authorities to give the green light to those who 
took part in the "boycott" to gather news wherever they want as 
if nothing had happened. 
  Xi Yang was convicted according to law by the mainland 
judicial authorities for violation of the criminal law, which 
had absolutely nothing to do with normal news gathering in the 
mainland. It is inappropriate for some people to politicize 
what was obviously a legal issue, show no respect for facts or 
law, and "boycott" all kinds of news gathering in the mainland 
that they consider to be of a propaganda nature. The mainland 
Information Office made it clear that as you may "boycott" the 
invitations extended by some local authorities to gather news 
there, the local authorities can also reject your application 
for a news-gathering permit for the time being.

<F P=106> [By Chan Wai-Fong and Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has retaliated against Hong Kong 
journalists who signed a statement in support of jailed reporter 
Xi Yang. 
  It has rejected their applications to cover next week's 
visit 
by a Taiwanese delegation to the site of the Qiandao Lake 
boating tragedy. 
  At least seven media organisations were told by the local 
Xinhua (New China News Agency) office yesterday that if they 
wanted to cover the event they had to send journalists who had 
not signed the petition. 
  The Hong Kong Journalists' Association (HKJA) yesterday 
expressed regret at Beijing's move and said it was retaliatory 
and penalising. 
  Last month 117 journalists from 23 media organisations 
endorsed a statement expressing their concern and anger at the 
12-year jail sentence imposed on Ming Pao reporter Xi for 
"spying and stealing state secrets". 
  They also decided to boycott media invitations from China 
which they believe to be propagandist until the end of this 
month. 
  Chinese officials sent the journalists' statement and copies 
of their signatures to the Propaganda Department of the Chinese 
Communist Party, the All-China Journalists' Association, the 
State Council's Information Office, and the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office in Beijing. 
  In Hong Kong, the local Xinhua office, the Hong Kong 
Government, the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong and the News 
Executives Association also received copies. 
  Yesterday an official from the State Council's Information 
Office told the South China Morning Post that since its 
applicant was one of the signatories she was denied permission 
to cover the Taiwanese delegation's visit. 
  An official at the local Xinhua office also told the Post 
that if it wanted to cover the event it had to send another 
reporter who had not joined the boycott. 
  Ming Pao's application was also rejected, because the State 
Council's Taiwan office said it had no authority to handle Ming 
Pao's application. 
  Ming Pao had wanted to send its Taiwan correspondent. 
  Sun Nansheng, director of the propaganda department of the 
local Xinhua, said that it was "normal" that the applications 
were turned down since the journalists had openly declared a 
boycott. 
  Since the boycott has a time limit, the ban would probably 
be 
temporary, he said. 
  The HKJA said yesterday the ban was proof that China's 
existing rules on Hong Kong reporters was a mechanism to 
"screen" and control reporting. 
  It was also contrary to Beijing's statement that Xi's case 
was an individual one with nothing to do with normal reporting, 
the HKJA said. 
  A local member of the Preliminary Working Committee, Tam 
Yiu- 
chung, said yesterday it was reasonable for reporters to show 
their concern for a fellow reporter who had been jailed. 
  "They should not be punished just because of this," he said. 
  National People's Congress delegate Liu Yiu-chu also said 
China should not discriminate against reporters who had signed 
petition letters to express their personal views. 
  The tourist boat fire on Qiandao Lake killed 32 people, 
including a 24-member Taiwan tour group, last month. 
  The delegation consists of members of the Straits Exchange 
Foundation.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The Preliminary Working 
Committee for the Preparatory Committee of Hong Kong Special 
Adminstrative Region (SAR) will further strengthen contacts with 
Hong Kong residents and collaborate with them to prepare 
formation of the SAR government. Wang Fengchao, member of the 
political affairs panel of the committee, made the remarks here 
today during talks with leaders of the Democratic Alliance for 
Betterment of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Progressive Alliance. 
Wang said in the past few days, the political and economic 
panels of the committee met representatives from some political 
organizations and grass-roots bodies and listened to their 
opinions on the political structure, the economy and the 
people's livelihood in Hong Kong beyond 1997. Some of these 
opinions, he said, are very constructive and he believed the 
committee will do a better job together with the support and 
participation of Hong Kong people. He hoped various 
organizations, through communication with Hong Kong residents, 
will jointly take part in formation of the SAR and in preparing 
"Hong Kong people manage Hong Kong" after 1997. There will be 
no "through train" as the Sino-British talks has broken down, 
Wang said, adding the Chinese side still hopes to cooperate with 
the British side in fields of the economy and the people's 
livelihood. However, this cooperation depends on the attitude 
taken by the British side, he said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, may 4 (XINHUA) -- More than 100 young 
people from all walks of life gathered at a seminar here this 
afternoon to mark the 75th anniversary of the May 4th Movement. 
  The May 4th Movement in 1919 was an anti-imperialist, 
anti-feudal political and cultural movement. After the founding 
of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the day was 
established as the youth day in China. 
  A guest speaker at the seminar sponsored by the Hong Kong 
United Youth Association Limited (HKUYA), Zhang Junsheng, deputy 
director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch, urged the Hong 
Kong youth carry on the May 4th spirit and make more 
contributions to the realization of Hong Kong's smooth transfer 
of power in 1997 and prosperity of the motherland. 
  Zhang described the young people as "the masters of the next 
century" and hoped that they help maintain prosperity and 
stability in Hong Kong and facilitate China's reform and opening 
to the outside world. 
  Speaking at the senior [as received], Peter M.K. Wong, 
chairman of the HKUYA, said the Hong Kong young people are the 
masters of future Hong Kong. "It is of great significance for 
Hong Kong youth to review the May 4th Movement and carry on the 
May 4th tradition in the runup to 1997," he said. Giving 
lectures on the May 4th Movement and its significance at the 
seminar were Chow Kai-wing, senior lecturer of Department of 
History of the Hong Kong Baptist College, Ng Hong Mun, deputy to 
the Chinese National People's Congress, and legislator Li 
Ka-cheung.

<F P=106> [Report from Beijing by special correspondent: "T.K. Ann </F>
Resigns His Post as CPPCC Vice Chairman"] 
  [Text] An informed source here disclosed that T.K. Ann, an 
incumbent vice chairman of the mainland's Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, 
recently tendered a verbal resignation to the higher leadership 
in Beijing, asking to be discharged from the post of vice 
chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. 
  It is said that the reason he gave in support of his 
resignation is that he is too old and his health is not good 
enough to allow him to perform his duties competently in such an 
important position as CPPCC vice chairman. Therefore he hopes 
that the position can be given to someone younger. 
  However, his request was rejected at once by the ranking 
mainland Chinese official concerned, who urged him to keep the 
post and promised him that all he needs to do as vice chairman 
is to attend a few important meetings of the CPPCC or other 
organizations in Beijing and to show up at some major functions 
in Hong Kong. 
  T.K. Ann, now 82 years old, is not merely an entrepreneur, 
but also a linguist of rather high standing. His extensive 
knowledge and ability were appreciated by Deng Xiaoping, who 
therefore nominated him as vice chairman of the CPPCC National 
Committee. 
  Taking up the post as chairman of the Hong Kong Textile 
Industry Federation in the 1950's, T.K. Ann later held a series 
of other posts: member of the Hong Kong Legislative and 
Executive Councils, and chairman of the Trade Development 
Council. In the 1980's, he was appointed by the Chinese side to 
be member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC National 
Committee. At the same time, he held such important posts as 
vice chairman of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee and 
member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee, 
playing an influential political role in both China and Hong 
Kong. 
  In March 1993, T.K. Ann was further elected vice chairman of 
the CPPCC National Committee, thus reaching the peak of his 
political career. Only one year later, however, he unexpectedly 
tendered his resignation. 
  T.K. Ann has always deliberately maintained a low political 
profile in his different positions. Seldom has he readily 
stated his stance on public occasions. He has always tried to 
decline interviews by reporters, and if he could no longer 
decline, he would confine the interview to a discussion on 
academic matters or to chats on personal affairs; never would he 
touch on sensitive political issues. 
  Business figures very close to T.K. Ann said advanced age 
and 
poor health are certainly reasons for his resignation, but the 
fact that he is indifferent to and tired of politics -- as he 
often has said in private -- could possibly be another reason. 
  It is said that in recent years T.K. Ann has had to devote 
much of his time and energy to the management and operation of 
the Winsor Industrial Group, a company listed on the Hong Kong 
stock market with him as group chairman. This is perhaps 
another reason why he is tired of the official post.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" by Tonny Chan] </F>
  [Text] The government has brought in a senior Australian 
official in what is being seen as an attempt to bolster the 
traditional British style of the civil service against the 
influence of China. 
  Australian civil servant John Hamilton is taking part in a 
far-reaching overhaul of the bureaucracy. 
  His arrival comes as a battle rages between Britain and 
China 
over the loyalty of the territory's 180,000 civil servants in 
the runup to China's takeover in 1997. 
  The overhaul, known as the Public Sector Reform (PSR) 
program, will particularly affect civil servants with the 
calibre to rise to the top of the service. 
  The government's top brass is said to be anxious that 
mainland ethics and practices could become influential in the 
civil service and take the place of the administrative culture 
that is being built up to carry on after 1997. 
  The government has confirmed Mr Hamilton's appointment. 
  Before beginning his 13-month secondment on 10 January, Mr 
Hamilton was assistant commissioner of the Australian Public 
Service Commission for human resources management. 
  A government spokesman said Mr Hamilton was responsible for 
"developing a systematic approach to performance appraisal, 
training and career development" within the civil service and 
was seconded for his solid human resource management background. 
  "Staff of the Civil Service Branch have previously visited 
the Australian Public Service Commission," he said. 
  "(It was) considered the Australian experience in human 
resource management would be a useful reference for Hong Kong in 
the implementation of the PSR program." 
  A theme of the PSR is to recommend a civil service mechanism 
that would uphold "human rights, openness and fairness". 
  A distinctive difference between Australia's public service 
and that in Britain and Hong Kong is that in Australia, top 
policy secretaries are employed on five-year contracts. 
  The [preceding word as published] enables them to forcefully 
confront outside political pressure. 
  The Australian Consulate-General in Hong Kong said its 
diplomats here were aware of Mr Hamilton's secondment, but its 
press officer said she was unable to provide The Hongkong 
Standard with further information. 
  The Australia Public Service Commission said simply that Mr 
Hamilton's assignment was to look at Hong Kong's public service. 
  The Secretary for the Civil Service Michael Sze returned 
from 
a two-week visit to Australia on Sunday. 
  A local political columnist quoted sources as saying that he 
had focused on how "fairness" was upheld in Australia's civil 
service. 
  The theme of openness and fairness had been emphasised by 
Governor Chris Patten in his rows with China. 
  A British parliamentary report recently called on the 
government to form a human rights commission to keep a permanent 
watch on human rights in the territory. 
  Beijing is worried Britain may use human rights to 
internationalise Hong Kong after 1997. Members of the 
Preliminary Working Committee sounded just such a warning on 
Monday. 
  The territory's government vehemently denied the present 
promotion mechanism in the civil service is unfair despite the 
fact that Mr Hamilton has been asked to carry out a review. 
  A civil service spokesman also rejected the idea that 
personal influence dominates the civil service promotion system. 
  He said there were clear guidelines including promotion 
criteria specified in the civil service regulation which 
promotion boards had to follow. 
  He said the boards comprised enough members from different 
ranks to ensure that they fully understood the job requirement 
and the candidates performance. 
  In cases within the jurisdiction of the Public Service 
Commission, the boards recommendations had to be referred to the 
commission for advice before they could be approved, he added. 
  "The system is a fair one and has adequate checks and 
balances," the spokesman said. 
  He said the PSR program was aimed at improving the civil 
service's efficiency and quality.

  [Text] A senior Chinese official has given an assurance 
that civil servants who hold British citizenship under the 
British Nationality Scheme will not be discriminated against in 
their careers with the Special Administrative Region (SAR) 
government. Speaking at a meeting with the New Hong Kong 
Alliance yesterday, visiting Deputy Director of the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO), Wang Fengchao, said the civil 
servants should not be afraid of revealing their British 
citizenship. 
  The chairman of the Hong Kong Civil Servants' Association, 
Peter Wong Hyo, last night welcomed the clarification. He said 
it was a good thing for the Chinese Government to clear the 
doubts of civil servants. 
  "The Chinese Government will not discriminate against civil 
servants who have obtained British citizenship through the 
British Nationality Scheme," Mr Wang was quoted by Pao 
Ping-wing, of the Alliance, as saying. 
  Yesterday's assurance cleared up fears about China's 
attitude 
towards the nationality scheme, which was introduced to tackle 
the confidence crisis following the Tiananmen Square crackdown 
in 1989. It grants full British citizenship to 25,000 families 
in phases. China's refusal to recognise the scheme has created 
uncertainty over whether civil servants who obtained the right 
of abode in Britain would be victimised. 
  Mr Wang said: "Holders of the citizenship have no reason to 
worry about the exposure of their status." The nationality 
factor would only carry weight in the promotion of civil 
servants to secretary and deputy secretary levels, he added. 
Article 101 of the Basic Law stipulates that government posts 
at the rank of policy secretaries and deputy secretaries should 
be held by Chinese citizens with no right of abode in other 
countries.

<F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung and Fung Wai-Kong] </F>
  [Text] A senior Chinese official yesterday ruled out the 
possibility that some legislators sitting on the 1995 
Legislative Council [Legco] might not have to seek re-election 
in 1997. The clear message from the Deputy Director of the 
State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Wang 
Fengchao, dashed hopes that legislators representing the 
existing functional constituencies would survive the disbanding 
of the legislature at the changeover. Asked if there were a 
chance for a partial through-train arrangement, Mr Wang said: 
"There is no such possibility. 
  "According to the decision of the National People's 
Congress, 
the last legislature in Hong Kong must be formed in accordance 
with the Basic Law. 
  "The composition of the Legislative Council should be taken 
as a whole, including members returned through geographical 
election, functional constituency election or the Election 
Committee. 
  "Both the number of legislators in each category and the 
details of the election method should abide by the provisions in 
the Basic Law. There is no partial through-train arrangement," 
he said. 
  Speaking after meeting Mr Wang, Liberal Party chairman Allen 
Lee Peng-fei quoted the deputy director as saying all 60 seats 
in the law-making assembly would be up for re-election in 1997. 
Though it was likely the 21 existing functional constituency 
seats would remain after 1997, Chinese officials told Mr Lee 
they must be re-elected. 
  Despite the comments, legislators formally tabled their 
amendments yesterday to the electoral bill on the functional 
constituency seats, and the composition of the Election 
Committee. The United Democrats amendment demands that half of 
the Legislative Council be directly elected. It also includes 
the abolition of the Legco seats for the Urban Council, Regional 
Council and Heung Yee Kuk, to be replaced with three new 
functional constituencies covering retired people, housewives 
and students. The four Meeting Point legislators have indicated 
support. 
  Another vocal supporter of democracy, Emily Lau Wai-hing, 
put 
forward an even more ambitious amendment which demanded a 100 
per cent directly elected legislature. The Liberal Party has 
yet to decide whether to table its own amendment or support 
other similar ones. 
  A group of independent legislators is working on a more 
conservative proposal which seeks to scale down the number of 
voters in the functional constituencies. Eric Li Ka-cheung, an 
independent legislator, has been liaising with several other 
independent legislators and the Liberal Party to formulate an 
amendment based on the compromise package proposed by the 
British side during negotiations with China last year which 
reduces the number of voters in the functional constituencies 
from 2.5 million to less than 650,000.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "HK's Interests Neglected"] </F>
  [Text] It is rare for Hong Kong to speak out with such 
passion against both its present and future sovereign nations 
simultaneously. Yet the motion passed in the Legislative 
Council on Wednesday calling on both Britain and China to stop 
violating the Joint Declaration bore the support of all the main 
parties and the majority of independents into the bargain. 
  Neither London nor Beijing should be under any illusion that 
the criticism was not deeply felt. The vote was an important 
message to both sides to remember that the point of the Joint 
Declaration was more than just the transfer of sovereignty. 
What was at stake was the maintenance of the welfare and the 
freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. There have been times as 
the two distant capitals have confronted each other over recent 
years when that commitment to the people of the territory has 
been forgotten. And the feeling of resentment at that obvious 
neglect of Hong Kong's interest has rarely been stronger than 
today, when the two sides refuse to talk to each other in public. 
  No doubt those at whom the motion is mainly addressed will 
attempt to fob off critics with the observation that different 
legislators had widely differing reasons for supporting the 
censure. The democratic parties are incensed at the lack of 
democratic reform, British acquiescence in China's position on 
the Court of Final Appeal and the apparent threat to Hong Kong's 
rights and freedoms. The Liberals fear the lack of convergence 
and cooperation for a smooth transition. 
  But the criticisms from both sides are valid. And while 
Chris Patten plays political games to keep himself in the public 
eye and upstage Lu Ping, the majority wish he would buckle down 
to practical governing instead. 
  Legislators have echoed Shakespeare's wish for "a plague on 
both your houses", rejecting both sides' unconvincing excuses 
for the neglect of their obligations to the people of Hong Kong. 
In that they will enjoy the public's full support.

  [Text] The European Union (EU) will not review quotas 
imposed on 15 March this year on selected consumer goods made in 
China until December, when the present quota scheme lapses. 
  Etienne Reuter, head of the Hong Kong office of the European 
Union (EU), told the Financial Review that the December review 
would only look into a modification of the scheme, which would 
probably be reimposed next year. 
  This was certain unless a strong lobby "provoked" a review 
for its removal, Mr Reuter said. The quota scheme was nothing 
new... it merely simplified similar schemes imposed by countries 
in the EU, he said. 
  EU members had imposed 4,700 notional restrictions on 
imported goods which were simplified into the quota scheme. 
  Items covered under the quota scheme are toys, footwear, 
gloves, porcelain kitchen and tableware, ceramic kitchen and 
tableware, glassware and radios. 
  The imposition of the scheme brought howls of protests from 
Hong Kong manufacturers. Many have based their operations in 
China. 
  Meanwhile, Luis Larroque, executive vice-president of the 
Spanish Foreign Trade Institute, said Spain had opposed the 
quota scheme and was supporting limited barriers against Chinese 
goods. 
  However, the quota scheme was "provisional only" and would 
be 
lifted when "some part of the EU industries have adjusted to the 
world market", Mr Larroque said. 
  Mr Reuter also gave an assurance that the 20 China-made 
products placed under surveillance for possible import quotas 
would not mean the EU would necessarily restrict these products 
soon. 
  "They are just being monitored and there are no indications 
that trade (of these goods) will be restricted," he said. 
  Trade groups in Hong Kong and the EU are protesting against 
the imposition of the quota scheme and have petitioned the 
Chinese government to push for its removal. 
  The quotas would mean substantial cuts in their export 
receipts, which could reach more than $3 billion by year's end, 
local groups said. 
  Europe's Foreign Trade Association (FTA) -- which groups big 
importers of Chinese consumer goods, including department stores 
-- have written to the Chinese government. 
  These groups want the import restrictions to be delayed at 
least until next year because orders have already been placed 
with firms in China. 
  Local and EU trade groups have also complained that the 
quota 
scheme was complicated and will result in uncertainties in the 
planning of purchases. 
  Other groups complained that the scheme would increase 
bureaucracy and thus add to operating costs.

  [Text] Macao, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Twenty-eight youth 
organizations in Macao took part in a gathering Wednesday [4 
May] evening to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the May 4, 
1919, movement. 
  Guo Dongpo, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Macao branch, 
said at the gathering that the May 4 movement was of great 
significance, calling on Macao youths to learn from and carry 
forward the patriotic spirit of the May 4 movement, to foster a 
belief of loving the motherland and loving Macao. 
  He also encouraged local youth organizations to play an 
active role in publicizing the Macao Basic Law and expressed the 
hope that Macao youths would become more concerned with matters 
in the transitional period, to guarantee that these matters be 
handled in convergency with the basic law. 
  Also in Wednesday evening, XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Macao branch 
and Macao university [University of East Asia] held another art 
performance to mark the 75th anniversary of the May 4, 1919, 
movement . 
  A group of retired cultural workers gathered together, 
singing patriotic songs during the war of resistance against 
Japan (1937-1945) and those popular in the 1950s, to commemorate 
this historical incident. Many of these retired workers 
participated in the anti-Japanese war and national salvation 
movement.

  [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese top judge said 
here today that China has basically completed the legal system 
for the protection of intellectual property and other invisible 
property. 
  Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, made 
the remark at the opening ceremony of the Licensing Executives 
Society (LES) International Conference '94, with businessmen, 
jurists and scholars from some 30 countries and representatives 
from international organizations in attendance. 
  Ren congratulated the opening session on behalf of the 
Chinese Government and the Supreme People's Court and 
appreciated LES' contribution to the dissemination of licensing 
knowledge, the exchange of licensing information, the 
enhancement of the working skills of licensing executives and 
the promotion of international licensing. 
  The president said that China has finished the amendments to 
the patent law and the trademark law, which have further 
enlarged and strengthened the protection of patent and trademark 
rights. 
  China has also joined the Berne Convention and the World 
Copyright Convention, he said, and therefore, copyright 
protection has basically met the requirements of international 
practice. 
  Ren said that the protection of trade secrets has been 
stipulated in the anti-unfair competition ruling enacted last 
December. 
  According to him, intellectual property tribunals have been 
set up within provincial or municipal courts of Guangdong, 
Hainan, Fujian, Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. 
  Ren said that China is willing to strengthen international 
exchanges and cooperation and to introduce and study all the 
useful advanced technology and experiences of foreign countries 
in order to push the country's national economy and society 
towards modernization. 
  Oliver Axster, president of LES International, said that 
holding his society's conference in China shows the technology 
transfer and licensing in Asia, including China, shall have 
promising prospects.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing said here today that a complete legal system for the 
protection of intellectual property rights in China has provided 
a legal safeguard for the country's development of licensing 
trade. 
  Li made the remark when meeting with representatives to a 
conference of the Licensing Executives Society (LES) 
International, which was opened here Friday [6 May] with 
businessmen, jurists and scholars from some 30 countries and 
representatives from international organizations in attendance. 
  Li said that China will make greater efforts to transfer 
technology abroad while introducing more technologies from 
foreign countries. 
  China's legal system for the protection of intellectual 
property has been improved, Li said, and the country's 
new-amendment to the Patent Law and the Trademark Law have 
strengthened the protection of patent and trademark rights. 
  The vice-premier said that China's participation in the Bern 
Convention and the World Copyright Convention has basically made 
its copyright protection meet the requirements of international 
practice. 
  The country's protection of trade secrets has been 
stipulated 
in the Anti-Unfair Competition Law enacted last December, he 
added. 
  Li congratulated the opening of the conference on behalf of 
the Chinese Government and appreciated LES's contribution to the 
dissemination of licensing knowledge in China, the exchange of 
licensing information and enhancement of the working skills of 
licensing executives. 
  Li said that as China is accelerating its pace of 
establishment of a socialist market economy and maintaining a 
sustained and healthy economic development, the country has seen 
a speedy development of technology transfer. 
  Statistics show that China has signed a total of 7,000 
contracts of technology import and export with a contractual 
value totalling 48 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Li said that China is to import more advanced and useful 
technology from foreign countries to update the present 
enterprises at home. 
  Meanwhile, the country will spare no effort in exporting 
technology abroad, the vice-premier said. 
  Oliver Axster, president of LES International, was present 
at 
the meeting in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of the State Council 
and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing met with participants to the 1994 Scola world conference 
here today. 
  Scola, based in McClelland, Iowa, U.S.A., is a global 
language- teaching TV station. Its programs cover North and 
South Americas and other countries and regions. 
  Since 1991, China's Yellow River TV station has been 
providing the Scola station with news program and features about 
China. 
  During today's meeting, Li congratulated the opening of 
Scola's annual conference in China, saying he was pleased to 
learn that Yellow River TV station's programs are welcome in the 
U.S. 
  Describing Scola's teaching-language via satellite TV as "a 
great cause", Li said foreign-language teaching enhances mutual 
understanding, promotes friendship and cooperation as well as 
economic and cultural exchanges among different countries and 
peoples. 
  Scola President Lee Lubbers said he was proud that his TV 
station beams Chinese news programs to North America. 
  It is important to let U.S. students to know about China and 
spread Chinese language in that country, he said. 
  On May 2, Scola convened its annual meeting in Taiyuan, 
capital of Shanxi Province, where the Yellow River TV station is 
headquartered. Television and educational experts and scholars 
from the U.S., Germany, France, Japan and China's 15 provinces 
and municipalities attended the conference. 
  Zeng Jianhui, director of the State Council's Information 
Office, and Zhang Weiqing, vice governor of Shanxi Province, 
were present at today's meeting.

  [Text] Vienna, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) said today it will not send an inspection 
team to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to 
observe the refueling of the country's main nuclear reactor. 
  "We received a letter from the DPRK a short while ago, but 
it 
does not constitute the basis for sending an inspection team to 
the DPRK," a spokesman for the Vienna-based agency said. 
  Therefore, the spokesman said, "The IAEA will not send an 
inspection team." 
  The DPRK's letter was a reply to one sent Tuesday [3 May] by 
the IAEA to the DPRK's Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam insisting 
that its inspectors carry out safeguard tests during the 
refueling. 
  Earlier, the DPRK had invited the IAEA to send inspectors to 
watch the replacement of spent uranium fuel rods at its main 
five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, but stressed the IAEA could 
only observe the operation. 
  But the IAEA insisted that its inspectors make tests at the 
reactor to ensure that no radioactive fuel had been diverted 
into the making of nuclear weapons, as suspected by Western 
countries. 
  The DPRK says its nuclear facilities are for peaceful 
purposes only. 
  The IAEA spokesman also said that "Refueling the reactor 
without IAEA inspectors and permission for them to carry out 
safeguard inspections constitutes a serious violation of the 
safeguard agreement."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Japan and the United States 
have agreed to form a new framework to promote their exchange of 
defense technology, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported today. 
  Under the new framework, the defense departments of the two 
countries will promote specific projects to develop new defense 
systems and improve existing defense techniques, the leading 
business daily said. 
  Tokyo and Washington will call on their respective 
businesses 
concerned to exchange views on the issue, it said. 
  In addition, the two sides will speed up technological 
interchanges by undertaking joint research. 
  The agreement was reached after the United States voiced its 
strong discontent about lopsided transfers of defense 
technologies to Japan, the paper said. 
  It is also in line with Tokyo's desire to expand 
technological exchange with the United States to strengthen the 
Japan-U.S. Security setup.

  [Text] Vienna, May 8 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Muslims and Croats 
and the Croatian Republic reached agreement in principle on the 
borders of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation here today. 
  They agreed to use the results of a census conducted in 1991 
and give all cities and towns where Croats and Muslims 
constitute the majority to the Muslim-Croat Federation, the 
Croatian news agency HINA quoted Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir 
Zubak as saying. 
  Bosnian Foreign Minister Ifran Ljubijankic said the 
federation will have more than 51 percent of Bosnia's territory. 
  U.S. Special Envoy Charles Redman said the round of 
negotiation was held in a "friendly atmosphere" and made certain 
achievement. But he added that Muslims and Croats could reach 
final agreement on borders only after the Bosnian issue is 
solved comprehensively. 
  Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic both showed some optimism about the 
negotiation. 
  The negotiation is being conducted in two separate working 
groups, one of which is focusing on the border issue.

  [Text] San Jose (California), 6 May (XINHUA) -- State 
Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua has successfully concluded his 
nine-day official visit to the United States, and he left here 
on the afternoon of 6 May for home via Hawaii. 
  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua issued a statement on the eve of his 
departure, saying that his U.S. visit was successful, that he 
was very satisfied with the outcome of the visit, and that the 
visit fulfilled the purpose of "enhancing mutual understanding, 
promoting Sino-U.S. friendship, and developing mutually 
beneficial cooperation." 
  Zou Jiahua was the highest-ranking Chinese leader to pay an 
official visit to the United States in the last five years. 
During his visit, he met with President Clinton at the White 
House. Clinton said that both the U.S. Government and himself 
were willing to make common efforts with China to settle the 
differences between the two countries to further develop 
Sino-U.S. relations. Zou Jiahua stressed that the two countries 
should focus on seeking common ground, settle past disputes as 
quickly as possible, and restore and increase exchange and 
cooperation in all fields between the two countries. 
  Zou Jiahua also exchanged views frankly, sincerely, and in a 
friendly manner with the U.S. secretary of commerce, secretary 
of energy, secretary of the Treasury, and the acting secretary 
of state on furthering Sino-U.S. cooperation in all fields. 
  Zou Jiahua also visited a few large U.S. companies which 
have 
economic and trade relations with China, and he learned directly 
that a large number of people from U.S. business and enterprise 
circles have a strong hope for and interest in developing 
economic, trade, and technical cooperation with China. China 
also signed more than 10 cooperation agreements and letters of 
intent with the U.S. AT&amp;T Corporation, ARCO Corporation, 
Amaco 
Corporation, and Exxon Corporation.

<F P=106> [Report: "Gao Shangquan Says Renewal of China's MFN Trading </F>
Status is Important to Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Gao Shangquan, head of the mainland's Preliminary 
Working Committee's economics sub-group, maintained: It is 
unwise for the United States to apply pressure against China and 
set all kinds of conditions on the issue of most-favored-nation 
[MFN] treatment. Yu Xiaosong, vice minister of the State 
Economic and Trade Commission and a mainland member of the 
economic sub-group, stated: If the United States takes measures 
against China's state- owned enterprises, this will mean 
creating new contradictions in Sino-U.S. economic development. 
  After visiting the One Country, Two Systems Research Center 
on 2 May, when asked about the question of the U.S. extension of 
MFN treatment to China, Gao Shangquan said: Whether or not the 
United States grants China MFN is also extremely important to 
Hong Kong. If China's MFN treatment is not renewed, Hong Kong's 
interests will suffer. Moreover, not only does the issue have a 
bearing on Hong Kong, but it is also very important to the 
United States itself. It is thought that entrepreneurs and 
ordinary people in the United State all hope that China will 
have MFN renewed. 
  He criticized the United States for always setting all sorts 
of conditions every time the MFN question is discussed. This 
has also been the case in the past. It applied pressure against 
China on the issue. 
  In regard to a report that the United States will take 
measures against China's state-owned enterprises and levy heavy 
tariffs on their products, Gao Shangquan said: State-owned 
enterprises constitute a very big part of China's national 
economy. Reforming state-owned enterprises is the focal point 
of economic reform. What is detrimental to China's state-owned 
enterprises will also be detrimental to U.S. enterprises, 
because China's state-owned enterprises are involved in all 
cooperation and trade activities between China and the United 
States. Moreover, Hong Kong will also be affected as a result. 
  Prior to the visit, Yu Xiaosong remarked: The United States 
should not take measures against China's state-owned 
enterprises, otherwise, it will create new contradiction in 
Sino-U.S. economic development. This will have very bad effects 
on both sides. If the United States take measures against 
state-owned enterprises, this will affect other fields in its 
economic ties with China. 
  He did not think that current Sino-U.S. relations had become 
quite tense because of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan or a meeting 
with the Dalai Lama by American leaders. He maintained that 
these issues had nothing to do with the economy. When asked of 
his confidence in MFN renewal, he stated: This is a matter for 
the Americans. You must ask U.S. President Bill Clinton or the 
secretary of state.

  [Text] Washington, May 6 (XINHUA) -- About 800 American 
companies, trade associations, farm organizations and consumer 
groups wrote Thursday [5 May] to U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
urging him to extend the most favored nations (MFN) trading 
status to China. 
  The business coalition for U.S.-China trade released the 
letter today and stated that not renewing China's MFN status 
would jeopardize the over 180,000 high-wage American jobs 
dependent upon the over 9 billion worth of U.S. goods and 
service exported to China last year. 
  In the letter which about 800 American businesses put their 
signatures to, the coalition said that "our companies are 
engaged in diverse businesses, ranging from manufacturing, 
farming, and retailing to financial and entertainment services, 
but we share a common conviction that trade with China is vital 
to America's future." 
  "We are deeply concerned that initiating economic conflict 
through MFN revocation or other sanctions, such as denying MFN 
for state-owned companies, would put American jobs and exports 
at risk, cede the Chinese market to Europe and Japan," it noted. 
  John McDonnell, chairman of McDonnell-Douglas, explained in 
a 
news release by the coalition that "China represents an 
incredible market opportunity which will create thousands of 
additional U.S. jobs and further improve the U.S. economy as the 
Chinese demand more American products and service." 
  "If we let this opportunity slip away, our global 
competitors 
will take over where we leave off and it will be nearly 
impossible to recover a competitive position in that area of the 
world," McDonnell said. 
  The business leaders highlighted the important role that 
Chinese market has for the American consumer. 
  "Loss of MFN or any form of trade sanctions will have a 
direct cost for American consumers," said Myron Ullman, chairman 
of R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc. "Low- and middle-income American 
families will face higher prices and shortages of many familiar 
items." 
  Maurice Greenberg, chairman of American International Group, 
said the United States ought to view its relationship with China 
"in a broader, strategic context and not have a single issue 
foreign policy." 
  "Massive change is occurring in China, bringing with it 
improvements in living conditions for the Chinese people that 
would have been impossible to envision even a few years ago," 
Greenberg added. 
  The business leaders urged Clinton to support continued U.S. 
trade with China by extending MFN and to devise a U.S. policy 
that de-links trade sanction and human rights.

  [Text] Washington, 6 May (XINHUA) -- A six-member 
delegation headed by Zhang Dengyi, secretary general of the 
State Science and Technology Commission, yesterday held a report 
meeting at the Chinese Embassy in Washington to brief U.S. 
Government officials and people from U.S. enterprise and 
environmental protection circles on the contents of the "China 
21st Century Agenda." 
  The agenda, which was recently approved by the State 
Council, 
is a detailed program of action prepared by the Chinese 
Government for implementing the strategy of sustained 
development decided on in June 1992 by the UN Conference on the 
Environment and Development. It is the first document submitted 
in response to the "21st Century Agenda" adopted by the UN 
conference. 
  In his speech, Zhang Dengyi said: The central idea of the 
"China 21st Century Agenda" is to carry through the strategy of 
sustained development, and, in light of China's reality, to 
establish unified policies on economic construction, social 
work, environmental protection, natural resources utilization, 
human resources development, and other important issues, in 
order to achieve comprehensive results in every aspect and to 
attain the most desirable objectives. 
  Zhang Dengyi added: China has decided to inject the 
substance 
of the agenda, especially the important principles in it, into 
actual practices in all sectors. In particular, we will 
incorporate some key programs outlined in the agenda in the 
Ninth "Five-Year Plan for Economic Development" and in other 
plans whose duration is longer. 
  He stressed: China has determined to take concrete measures 
in the hope that it will become the first country to fulfill the 
"21st Century Agenda." To fulfill this hope, we must cooperate 
with other countries. 
  He said that China welcomes the more than 30 attendees of 
the 
report meeting to attend a high-level roundtable meeting on the 
"China 21st Century Agenda" -- to be held in Beijing on 9 July 
-- to discuss ways to carry out the strategy of sustained 
development and to study the possibility of international 
cooperation in this field with broad prospects. 
  The delegation arrived in Washington on 4 May at the 
invitation of the U.S. Presidential Committee on Sustained 
Development. The delegation yesterday called on host officials 
and visited the World Bank and the World Resources Study Center. 
While in New York, the delegation called on three UN deputy 
secretaries general and other UN officials, in winning some 
international organs' support for carrying out the "China 21st 
Century Agenda." 
  After its U.S. visit, the delegation will fly to Ottawa, the 
capital of Canada, on 8 May.

  [Text] Washington, 4 May (XINHUA) -- More than 700 
Chinese students and scholars studying in the United States and 
other countries recently wrote a joint letter to U.S. President 
Bill Clinton, appealing to him to unconditionally extend the 
Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status to China. At a hearing 
held by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, the 
students made their letter public. 
  In their letter, these students and scholars said: 
Withdrawing China's MFN status would not only hurt the Chinese 
people's interests but also American enterprises' business 
interests and opportunities in Chinese markets as well as 
American general interests in Asia. 
  They "firmly support the unconditional renewal of China's 
MFN 
status" and held that "the MFN should not be linked to human 
rights." 
  A total of 722 Chinese students and scholars signed their 
names on the letter. They are mainly from several universities 
in the United States. Some students and scholars are studying 
in other foreign countries.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 7 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong, one of the 
most economically developed provinces in China, will encourage 
its enterprises to expand economic cooperation with overseas 
countries and regions, including the United States, according to 
an authoritative official of the province. 
  Addressing a special meeting on the environment for 
investment in the United States, Liao Guoji, deputy director of 
the Guangdong provincial committee of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, said yesterday that enterprises in the province 
will be encouraged to be export-oriented, to open more 
international markets and to invest abroad. 
  He noted that the United States is the biggest 
industrialized 
country, which has a long history of frequent economic and trade 
ties with Guangdong Province and it hopes to have more economic 
exchanges with the U.S. 
  By the end of last year, deputy director Liao said, 
Guangdong 
had signed over 140,000 contracts involving overseas investment 
with 70 countries and regions and had actually utilized 29.45 
billion U.S. dollars in overseas funds. There are 45,074 
overseas-funded enterprises in the province, over 400 of which 
are U.S.-funded enterprises involving nearly one billion U.S. 
dollars in funds. 
  Meanwhile, Liao said, Guangdong Province has set up over 50 
enterprises abroad and many enterprises plan to invest in the 
United States. 
  U.S. diplomats in the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong gave 
briefings to the meeting about their country's environment for 
investment, including introduction to a number of U.S. laws and 
regulations.

  [Text] Beijing, May 6 KYODO -- A group of Japanese lawyers 
lodged a formal protest with the Japanese Embassy in Beijing on 
Friday [6 May] demanding the resignation of Japanese Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano over his remarks on World War II. 
  The delegation led by Shigemitsu Oda protested Nagano's 
statement published Wednesday in the MAINICHI SHIMBUN newspaper 
that Japan's involvement in World War II was "not a war of 
aggression" and the Nanjing massacre was a "fabrication." 
  The lawyers are on a mission to investigate Chinese war 
victims and the human rights situation in China. 
  Nagano retracted his remarks at a press conference Friday.

  [Text] Beijing, May 8 KYODO -- Some two dozen Chinese 
wartime victims will start besieging the Japanese Embassy in 
Beijing with telephone calls for five days from Monday to 
protest former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's denial of the 
1937 Nanjing massacre, Chinese sources said Sunday [8 May]. 
  The sources said the angry Chinese are not satisfied with 
Nagano's resignation and are demanding an official apology from 
the Japanese Government. 
  The Chinese are also seeking a specific guarantee from Tokyo 
to avoid a repetition of such remarks questioning Japan's 
wartime aggression, the sources said. 
  The sources said the war victims have decided to employ the 
telephone tactic because it is difficult for Chinese to stage 
demonstrations. 
  The sources were alluding to the arrests of over 100 Chinese 
for trying to demonstrate near the Japanese Embassy at the time 
of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to Beijing in 
March.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 KYODO -- Japanese Ambassador to 
China Michihiko Kunihiro visited the Chinese Foreign Ministry on 
Saturday [7 May] to clarify his government's position on the 
Nagano affair, a Japanese official said. 
  Kunihiro told Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan that the 
basic stand of Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa would be "to make great efforts for 
future-oriented relations between Japan and China," an embassy 
spokesman said. 
  Tang said the Chinese Government "was reacting with 
restraint" over the Nagano affair, but seeing the enormous 
political repercussions the issue has aroused, they "felt 
indignant and very concerned," the spokesman said. 
  The Chinese vice minister said his government will pay great 
attention "to the manner in which Japan deals with Nagano." 
  Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano caused an uproar Wednesday 
when he denied that Japan waged a war of aggression in Asia 
during the 1930s and World War II and massacred hundreds of 
thousands of Chinese in Nanjing in 1937. 
  Chinese newspapers Saturday reported Nagano's public 
retraction of his remarks and apology on Friday and also the 
possibility of his resignation after Hata's return from a trip 
to Europe. 
  Tang told the Japanese ambassador to convey to the Japanese 
Government that Nagano's statements "greatly hurt and angered 
the people of China," the spokesman said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 KYODO -- Japan has notified China of 
the resignation of Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, the Japanese 
Embassy said in a statement Monday [9 May]. 
  Japanese consular official Yasuyoshi Ichihashi notified 
Chinese Foreign Ministry official Qian Xianglin on Sunday of 
Nagano's resignation and the appointment of Hiroshi Nakai as new 
justice minister, the statement said. 
  Ichihashi also conveyed the stance of Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata concerning Japan's involvement in World War II. 
  "Our past action, including aggression and colonial rule, 
caused unbearable suffering and sorrow. It is essential for 
each one of us to face history squarely and to share in 
determination not to repeat it," Hata was quoted as saying. 
  Qian was quoted as responding, "I appreciate your 
notification and will soon report it to my superior." 
  Nagano resigned Saturday after causing an uproar over his 
comments denying Japan's aggression during World War II and 
calling the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Chinese in 
Nanjing a "fabrication."

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 5 May (XINHUA) -- The 5 May issue of 
the "UNEN" Mongolian newspaper carries a commentary on the 
important significance of the just-concluded visit by Li Peng, 
premier of China's State Council, to Mongolia. 
  The commentary, which is entitled "The Most Honorable Guest 
From the Great Southern Neighboring Country," declares that 
thanks to a change in the international political climate, the 
tortuous history of Mongolian-Chinese relations is a thing of 
the past. The newspaper added that the visit of the most 
honorable guest from China to Mongolia at this juncture in which 
the bilateral relationship is moving ahead in line with the new 
era and the new concept has contributed greatly to enhancing the 
friendly and cooperative relationship between the countries. 
  The commentary notes that because China has been 
accelerating 
the pace of its development and expanding its scale of 
development in recent years, it is playing an increasingly 
larger role in international politics and in the world's 
economic life. 
  The commentary points out that during his visit to Mongolia, 
Premier Li Peng stressed that the Chinese Government has always 
attached importance to Sino-Mongolian ties, that China will not 
interfere in Mongolia's internal affairs, and that China is 
willing to work together with the Mongolian Government to 
develop lasting good-neighbor, friendly, and cooperative 
relations which look to the 21st century. This will undoubtedly 
have an important impact on increasing trust in the bilateral 
friendly and cooperative relationship.

led by He Zhiqiang arrived here on Friday [6 May] for a five-day 
goodwill visit to the country. This has been the second 
provincial delegation, following Guangdong Province, to visit 
Cambodia since the royal government was founded last October. 
  He Zhiqiang and the delegation called on Co-Prime Ministers 
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen on the day of their arrival and 
visited the port city of Sihanouk on Saturday. 
  On the rebuilding of Cambodia, Sihanouk said that the 
Cambodian economy in the 1950s and 1960s was better than that at 
present. After the 20-year-long war, Cambodia is poor and needs 
economic and technical assistance from foreign countries, he 
said. 
  "I am so happy that Cambodia and Yunnan Province will 
develop 
economic cooperation, particularly cooperation in agricultural 
technology," the king said. 
  He called on all parties in Cambodia to do their best to 
maintain peace and stability in Cambodia, without which foreign 
investors will hesitate to invest in the country. 
  He Zhiqiang, who is accompanied by 15 businessmen, agreed 
with what the king said and appreciated his efforts to rebuild 
Cambodia. He said his province will do its best to help Cambodia 
in its reconstruction. 
  Cambodia is the first leg of the delegation's 
three-nation-tour in Southeast Asia. The Chinese guests are 
scheduled to leave here on Wednesday for Thailand and Burma.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, 
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, today 
expressed the hope that the mutually trusted ties and 
cooperation between China and Laos will be developed in a 
long-term way. 
  This will be beneficial to both, said Liu at a meeting with 
a 
senior delegation from the Laotian Ministry of National Defence 
led by its minister Choummali Sai-gnason in the Diaoyutai State 
Guesthouse here this afternoon. 
  Their friendly conversation mainly centered on the further 
development of Sino-Lao relations and other issues. 
  Liu said China and Laos have enjoyed a long history of 
friendly contacts. At present bilateral ties have grown well 
and personnel exchanges between the two countries are increasing. 
  "It is our hope that such mutually trusted friendly ties 
will 
develop for a long time, which is beneficial to both," he said. 
  During the meeting Liu also briefed the visitors on China's 
reform and opening to the outside world. 
  Liu noted China has made great achievements in its reform 
and 
opening to the outside world over the past 15 years, adding that 
China is now in the best period since its founding in 1949. 
  Facts prove that a series of principles and policies that 
China is implementing are really effective, he said. 
  Of course, he said, since China is a very large country, its 
development is unbalanced. This requires us to continuously 
explore, take a positive attitude, and overcome difficulties so 
as to promote its economic development. 
  Choummali said the Laotian Government, Army and people will 
never forget the help that the Chinese Government, Army and 
people have offered to them. 
  "It is our resolute conviction to further consolidate and 
develop ties between the two governments, armed forces and 
peoples. The changing world situation will strengthen our 
resolve to this conviction," he said. 
  Choummali said: "We will do our best to promote bilateral 
friendly ties and cooperation in depth and in an all-round way." 
  The delegation arrived here on May 6 for an official 
goodwill 
visit to China at the invitation of State Councillor and 
Minister of National Defence Chi Haotian. Before their arrival 
here they visited Chengdu of Sichuan Province. 
  This morning, Chi hosted a welcoming ceremony on the square 
in front of the Military Museum of the Chinese People's 
Revolution here for Choummali and his party. Then the two 
ministers held talks and exchanged views on the development of 
the relations between the two countries and the two armed forces 
and international issues of common concern. 
  This evening, Chi gave a dinner in honor of Choummali and 
his 
party.

  [Text] Beijing, may 7 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the problems 
left over from the 1991 Gulf war should be peacefully solved on 
the basis of the total implementation of the resolution of the

the Middle East region. 
  Qian said that China was sympathetic to the difficult 
situation of the Iraqi people, and advocated that the 
international community should objectively comment on Iraq's

humanitarian considerations, to ease the sufferings of the Iraqi 
people, Qian said.

minister, introduced Iraq's implementation of the U.N. Security 
Council resolution, and its stand on issues such as the

  [Text] Beijing, may 7 (XINHUA) -- One experience 
attributing to the achievements China has made over the past 15 
years is that the government has always paid attention to the 
correct handling of the relations between reform, development 
and maintaining stability. 
  This was stated by Premier Li Peng at a meeting with Kenyan 
President Daniel T. arap Moi here today. 
  Reform can be deepened and economic and social development 
promoted only under the conditions of stability, Li said. 
  In the process of the reform, Li noted, the government 
encourages the spirit of making bold explorations and summing up 
experience constantly, and all reform measures should be tested 
in practice. A measure will be persisted in and perfected so 
long as it is beneficial to developing productivity, to 
strengthening the comprehensive national power and to raising 
the people's living standards, the premier added. 
  Since reform policies were carried out under the guidance of 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
Li said, great changes have taken place in China. But there is 
a long way to go before China becomes a strong and prosperous 
country and dozens of years of more efforts are still needed, he 
added. 
  During the meeting, Li told Arap Moi that the Chinese 
Government attaches great importance to its relations with 
Kenya. Thanks to the joint efforts, the relations have been 
developing smoothly and will be consolidated and developed in 
the future. 
  Li described Kenya as a country of important influence in 
Africa, praising the Kenyan Government for its achievements in 
safeguarding state sovereignty, maintaining national unity and 
developing the national economy. China also appreciates Kenya's 
foreign policy of non-alignment and keeping friendly relations 
with its neighboring countries. The policy has contributed to 
the stability in East Africa, Li said. 
  Arap Moi said that his visit to China has served to further 
strengthen and develop bilateral relations, trade and economic 
links in particular. The president also expressed agreement 
with what Li Peng said that all countries should choose their 
own roads of development in line with their own conditions. 
  Present at the meeting were Chen Changben, chairman of the 
Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice-minister of 
culture, Wang Changyi, assistant to the foreign minister, and 
Chen Pingchu, Chinese ambassador to Kenya. On the Kenyan side 
were S.K. Musyoka, minister of foreign affairs and international 
cooperation, J.J. Kamotho, minister of education, K. Kones, 
minister of state in the president's office, and P.L. Lotodo, 
minister of home affairs and national heritage. 
  President arap Moi is to leave here this evening for India.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 May (XINHUA) -- Premier of the State 
Council Li Peng met with Kenyan President T. arap Moi today at 
the Diaoyutai State Guest House and held warm and friendly talks 
with him. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, Li Peng welcomed President 
Moi's third visit to China on behalf of the Chinese Government, 
saying the Chinese Government and people attach great importance 
to the Sino-Kenyan relationship and to the friendship between 
the two peoples. He thanked their joint efforts and was pleased 
to see the smooth development of their bilateral relationship. 
China will continue to work together with Kenya to consolidate 
and develop bilateral ties. 
  Li Peng said Kenya is an important country of influence in 
Africa. The Kenyan Government and people, under the leadership 
of President Moi, have experienced gratifying achievements in 
safeguarding state sovereignty, maintaining national unity, and 
developing the national economy. China appreciates Kenya's 
foreign policy of peace and non-alignment, and of maintaining 
friendly relations with its neighboring countries. China also 
appreciates Kenya's positive contribution to safeguarding 
stability and development in East Africa. 
  Turning to China's reform and construction, Li Peng said 
China, a developing country with a large population, needs 
decades of more effort to become strong and prosperous. 
Therefore, the tasks ahead are arduous, and there is still a 
long way to go. China has undergone great changes following 15 
years of reform in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. One important 
experience China has gained over the past 15 years which needs 
to be emphasized is China has always paid attention to the 
correct handling of relations between reform, development, and 
maintaining stability. Li Peng continued, saying reform can be 
deepened and economic and social development promoted only under 
stable conditions. In the course of reform, China encourages 
the spirit of making bold exploration and constantly summing up 
experience. All reform measures should be tested in practice. 
A measure will be persisted in and perfected so long as it is 
beneficial to developing productivity, to strengthening the 
comprehensive national power, and to raising the people's living 
standards. 
  Moi said he would leave China for home with a full memory of 
goodwill from the Chinese Government and people. The president 
added that he witnessed the great development of the Chinese 
economy during his visit. Moi said he wanted to congratulate 
the Chinese people for their achievements, and added he has 
achieved his goal of further enhancing and developing the 
friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries, 
particularly economic and trade relations. Moi also said he 
completely agreed with Li Peng's view on "the need for each 
country to choose its own path of development in line with its 
circumstances." 
  Present at the meeting were Chen Changben, chairman of the 
Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice minister of 
culture; Wang Changyi, assistant to the foreign minister; and 
Chen Pingchu, Chinese ambassador to Kenya. On the Kenyan side 
were S.K. Musyoka, minister of foreign affairs and international 
cooperation; J.J. Kamotho, minister of education; K. Kones, 
minister of state in the president's office; P.L. Lotodo, 
minister of home affairs and national heritage; and James 
Simani, Kenyan ambassador to China. 
  This morning, President Moi toured the new technology and 
industry development and experimental zone as well as village 
and township enterprises in Beijing's Haidian District. The 
President and his party left here this evening for India after 
concluding their five-day state visit to China.

  [Text] Gothenburg, Sweden, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Lars-Ake 
Skager, mayor of Gothenburg, and Li Ruihuan, visiting chairman 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
(CPPCC) on Friday [6 May] spoke highly of the friendship and 
cooperation between Shanghai and the Swedish city. 
  They made their remarks at a banquet hosted in Gothenburg by 
the local mayor in honor of Li and attended by his entourage and 
senior local figures from the political and business fields. 
  Skager pointed out that Sweden and China had been conducting 
trade and economic exchange for many centuries and that the 
friendship between them had a long history. 
  Gothenburg was an important meeting point in their business 
activities and had established sisterly ties with Shanghai, the 
biggest city and an economic center of China, said the mayor. 
  He added that as a result, cooperation between the two 
cities 
in various fields had developed quickly. 
  In his turn, Li commented that as early as 250 years ago, a 
Swedish cargo ship had set sail from Gothenburg for the first 
voyage to China and that later from Gothenburg Chinese goods had 
been delivered to other parts of Sweden. 
  Currently, based on its high level of technical development, 
Gothenburg was making fresh advances in its cooperation with 
China in trade and the economy, said the CPPCC leader. 
  Before the banquet, the mayor briefed Li on the joint 
efforts 
being made by the two cities in environmental protection and Li 
expressed his appreciation for their increasing cooperation in 
various fields.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhang Zhipeng (1728 1807 7720) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zheng Jian (6774 1017)] 
  [Text] Bucharest, 4 May (XINHUA) -- When Romanian Prime 
Minister Vacaroiu met with General Zhang Wannian, member of the 
Central Military Commission and chief of the People's Liberation 
Army of China General Staff, and his party on the afternoon of 4 
May, he said that the Romanian Government is sincerely pleased 
with the tremendous achievements scored by China in economic and 
social development and that it is determined to further develop 
and expand its friendly cooperation with China. 
  Vacaroiu said: A traditional friendship exists between 
Romania and China; they share identical or similar views on 
major international issues, and their government departments 
have been holding contacts with each other at regular intervals. 
He expressed the hope that the meeting to be held by the mixed 
committee of the two governments soon will further promote the 
vigorous development of trade and economic relations between the 
two countries. 
  During the meeting, Zhang Wannian stressed that China and 
Romania are good and old friends. He focused his briefing on 
China's political stability, economic development, national 
unity, and social progress. 
  This morning, Lieutenant General (Chevlin), state secretary 
of Romania's Ministry of National Defense and chief of the 
Romanian armed forces joint staff, held formal talks with Zhang 
Wannian. Both sides unanimously expressed their belief that 
great changes have taken place in the two countries in recent 
years but that these have not affected Sino-Romanian friendship. 
The friendly relations between the two countries, between their 
peoples, and between their armies have enjoyed further 
development under the new historical condition. At the end of 
their talks, Romanian Defense Minister Tinca met with Zhang 
Wannian and his party. 
  Zhang Wannian and his party arrived here on the afternoon of 
3 May for a four-day goodwill visit.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic and UN Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi today met 
in Pale to discuss how to prevent an outbreak of violence in 
another hot spot in Bosnia -- Brcko. 
  Karadzic said that he had proposed a ceasefire between Serbs 
and Muslims in the area, and the deployment of an Unprofor force 
there. He also claimed that the Serbs would arrange a unilateral 
ceasefire if the Muslims would not agree to one. 
  While saying that the meeting had been helpful in promoting 
the peace process, Akashi would only promise more UN military 
observers for Brcko. 
  Brcko is a key strategic town bordering Serbia, the Serb- 
controlled area of Bosnia and the Serb-controlled part of 
Croatia. 
  The Bosnian Muslim government is reportedly preparing to 
launch a "war of liberation" in the area. 
  The Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, while inspecting 
the 
Muslim military front line near Brcko yesterday, said that the 
Muslims were ready for a decisive battle with the Serbs there. 
  Serb sources claim that the United States has promised to 
"take tough action" against the Serbs once the Muslim attack 
begins.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin conducted an investigation tour here, soliciting opinions 
from all walks of life on the reform and opening up, economic 
development and social stability. 
  On April 26-May 6, Jiang, also general secretary of the 
Communist Party Central Committee, visited local state-owned 
enterprises, where he had discussions with a number of 
enterprise managers on the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system in China. 
  He stressed the important role that large state enterprises 
play in establishing and developing a socialist market economic 
system, pointing out that the basic way out for state-owned 
enterprises lies in the further deepening of reforms. 
  Conditions are good in Shanghai for carrying out a modern 
enterprise system on a trial basis, said Jiang. 
  He urged the municipal party committee and the local 
government to continue to create a favorable environment and 
conditions for the reform of enterprises by conducting active 
explorations in readjusting the government's functions, 
improving the management of state-owned assets, perfecting the 
management inside enterprises, establishing a social security 
system, perfecting the market system and relieving the 
enterprises of excessive burdens. 
  The work should be well organized and done step by step, he 
said. 
  He called on party committees at various levels to earnestly 
study Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and better put it to practice. 
  In response to the demand of developing a socialist market 
economy, Jiang said, great efforts must be placed on the 
building of socialist ethics to improve the quality of the 
people at large and advance the development of the society on 
the whole. 
  He fully confirmed the achievements of local authorities in 
carrying out the national economic guidelines and ensuring good 
momentum in the economic development. 
  Jiang noted that the central authorities will persist firmly 
in the policy of opening up and developing Shanghai's Pudong New 
Area, the largest economic development zone in China. 
  The Pudong New Area not only concerns the development of 
Shanghai but also is an important symbol of China's reform and 
opening policy, Jiang said. 
  He asked local officials to insist on emancipating their 
minds and seeking truth from facts, to maintain and push the 
good momentum forward and do better work in the future.

<F P=106> [Dispatch from New York: "Shanghai Pro-Democracy Activist </F>
Lin Muchen [2651 3668 2525] Detained While Checking In at 
Airport"] 
  [Text] Lin Muchen, one of the drafters of the "19 Articles 
on 1994 Charter of Political Democratization," which was 
initiated by 54 people, including Bao Ge [7637 2047], Yang Zhou 
[2799 0719], and so on, had originally planned to leave Shanghai 
by Korean Air last Friday morning [6 May] for the United States 
to further his education at his own expense. Unexpectedly, when 
he checked in at the airport, he was detained by the 
authorities. By late Friday night there had been no news about 
him, and his family also knows nothing of his whereabouts 
despite inquiries through many channels. 
  As disclosed by a friend of Lin Muchen in New York, Lin was 
approved and issued with a student visa by the U.S. Consulate 
General in Shanghai to further his studies at his own expense. 
  Lin's friend pointed out that the Chinese authorities had 
approved allowing him to leave the country, but suddenly went 
back on their word and detained him. Obviously, this action is 
unwise as it happens on the eve of when U.S. President Clinton 
is about to announce whether he will extend most-favored-nation 
treatment to China on 3 June. 
  Lin Muchen is an "old line" pro-democracy activist. He was 
one of the organizers of the "Shanghai Spring" during the period 
of the "Xidan Democracy Wall" movement in Beijing as early as 
the late 1970's. Later, he was thrown into prison for his 
active participation in the pro-democracy movement in 1989. 
  Meanwhile, last Saturday [7 May] marked two years' of 
detention without trial for another Chinese dissident, Kang 
Yuchun [1660 3768 2504], who is being kept in the heavily 
guarded Beijing Banbuqiao Detention Center, and whose relatives

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (AFP) -- Zhai Weimin, a former 
student leader in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was arrested 
here last month, a friend of Zhai's said Monday. "Zhai Weimin 
was detained by police on April 23, and we have had no word of 
him since then," the source said. 
  Zhai had been arrested in Beijing in early March, and was 
then imprisoned in his home province of Henan, in central China. 
He had returned to Beijing in late March. He is the fifth 
Chinese dissident to be rounded up by police in less than a 
month. Four pro-democracy activists have been arrested in 
Shanghai since April 14. 
  Zhai, 23, was jailed for three and a half years for his role 
in the pro-democracy movement, which was crushed by the People's 
Liberation Army on June 4 1989. He was freed last September 13.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (AFP)--Chinese police arrested three 
more dissidents in Shanghai last week, including a painter, Lin 
Muchen, who was about to board a plane for the United States, a 
spokesman said. 
  Yang Zhou, who is spokesman of the Chinese Association for 
Human Rights, said Lin was detained at the airport on Friday. 
  "We understand that he was stopped by border police as he 
was 
about to board a flight to Seoul, where he was going to change 
planes for the U.S.," a spokeswoman at the U.S. consulate in 
Shanghai said. "He had been issued with a student visa for the 
U.S." 
  The other two were Li Guotao, the association's president, 
who was detained on May 2, and Dai Xuezhong, another association 
member, who was arrested the following day. The association's 
secretary-general, Wang Fucheng, has been in custody since April 
14. 
  The detentions come in the runup to the fifth anniversary of 
the Tiananmen Square killings, when the People's Liberation Army 
crushed a pro-democracy movement in the heart of Beijing in 
1989. "The June 4 commemoration is approaching, and (Chinese 
leader) Deng Xiaoping is in poor health," Yang said. "Party 
conservatives want to show that they have the situation under 
control." Several dissidents have been told to quit Shanghai by 
the end of May, diplomats there added. 
  In another development, Yan Huili, the wife of the 
well-known 
Shanghai dissident Zhang Xianliang, who was sentenced last 
August to three years' labour in a re-education camp, said she 
had been unable to visit her husband for three months.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 7 KYODO -- Four leading members of 
the Shanghai Association for Human Rights have apparently been 
arrested this week and their whereabouts remain unknown, 
pro-democracy activists said here Saturday [7 May]. 
  Detained are Association President Li Guotao, 40, Secretary 
General Wang Fuchen, 38, painter Lin Muchen, 46, a member of the 
board of directors, and another board member who was not 
identified. 
  The activists said the clampdown on the association may aim 
at curbing dissident activities ahead of the fifth anniversary 
of the suppression of pro-democracy demonstration at Tiananmen 
Square in Beijing on June 4, 1989. 
  Wang left for the southern island of Hainan on Wednesday and 
nothing was heard of him since. Li disappeared Monday, while the 
unnamed board member was arrested Tuesday, the activists said. 
  Painter Lin was arrested at Shanghai Airport Tuesday before 
leaving for the United States, where the artist planned to study. 
  Only a month ago, police in Shanghai temporarily detained a 
number of activists including Wang in advance of the arrival of 
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to the city. 
  Wang was also detained during the visit to China by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in March. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has said unless China makes 
substantial progress in human rights records, he will not extend 
China's most-favored-nation trade status in the U.S., which 
guarantees Chinese goods access to U.S. markets at lowest 
tariffs, when it comes up for renewal in June.

  [Excerpt] A wedding banquet for a dissident couple in 
Beijing earlier this week was cancelled due to the escalating 
security surveillance in the capital city. 
  Meanwhile, authorities announced yesterday a set of 
regulations designed to silence the vocal dissident community. 
In the runup to the fifth anniversary of the 4 June military 
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement police have stepped up 
close surveillance on dissidents. 
  The ninth student leader on the wanted list for the 1989 
protests, Zheng Xuguang, married recently in Xian and the couple 
had their honeymoon in Beijing earlier this week. 
  Mr. Zheng had planned to hold a wedding banquet on Thursday 
night in the capital, however he and his wife were ordered to 
return to Xian on Thursday by his parents-in-law, who were 
believed to be under pressure by police authorities, sources 
said. At least 10 guests invited to the banquet were from the 
dissident community. 
  Mr. Zheng was arrested in Beijing in January following his 
meeting with the pro-democracy Peace Charter campaigners. Due 
to close surveillance dissidents in Beijing said they found it 
difficult to move within the city. 
  Apart from the 4 June anniversary, the tightened security is 
also meant to keep dissidents quiet and avoid detention which 
may cause complications to the Sino-United States row over human 
rights. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- China today published a 
namelist of more than 60,000 correspondents from about 1,300 
media organizations. 
  This is the first time for the country to provide reporters' 
names to the public en masse. 
  The namelist was carried in a handbook entitled "Namelist of 
China's News Organizations and Reporters", edited by the 
PEOPLE'S DAILY, the Communist Party's official newspaper. 
  Editors said that the publication benefits "the 
reinforcement 
of the relationship between media and the people, the 
improvement of social supervision on the news circle," and is 
"an action that holds responsibility to readers." 
  An intensified information flow is pushing different walks 
of 
life to make frequent use of the media. 
  The selected media include the most authoritative and 
influential newspapers, radio and television stations, and news 
agencies in modern China. 
  China now has more than 2,000 newspapers and about 1,600 
radio and television stations. "The publication helps us to 
know the basic situation of the media and improve management and 
morality in the media circle," said Liang Heng, vice-director of 
the Press and Publication Administration. 
  The handbook lists the reporter's name, professional title, 
working department and reporting field. Photos were added for 
the leaders of certain news organizations. 
  These names were provided to the editors by the personnel 
departments of news entities without informing the concerned 
correspondents beforehand.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- The National People's 
Congress [NPC] Law Committee submitted three reports to the 
seventh meeting of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee that opened 
today. The reports disclosed the results of the committee's 
deliberations of the draft Foreign Trade Law, the draft State 
Compensation Law, and a draft decision on meting out punishment 
for offenses in connection with company and enterprise 
management. 
  The Law Committee states: Following the preliminary 
deliberations of these three draft bills by the fourth and fifth 
meetings of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee, the Law Committee 
distributed copies of the drafts to all provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities directly under the central 
government, as well as to relevant central departments. It also 
held informal discussions with relevant central departments, 
specialists, and foreign trade enterprises to canvass their 
opinions. The committee amended the drafts in accordance with 
the views of NPC Standing Committee members as a result of 
deliberations, as well as the views of people in other sectors. 
Believing that formulation of the three statutes was necessary 
and the drafts were basically feasible, the Law Committee would 
like to propose the NPC Standing Committee examine and approve 
them. 
  Xiang Chunyi, Cai Cheng, and Wang Shuwen, vice chairmen of 
the NPC Law Committee, today submitted three separate reports to 
the Standing Committee on the results of their deliberations. 
The reports contained the Law Committee's suggestions for 
amendments. 
  On the draft Foreign Trade Law, Xiang Chunyi said: The NPC 
Financial and Economic Committee and some localities have called 
for encouraging localities to engage in foreign trade, saying 
the law may not provide for such issues as not exercising 
management through mandatory planning, integrating industry with 
trade, and implementing the agency system. To this end, we 
would like to propose the draft be amended to read: "The state 
shall implement a unified foreign trade system, safeguard the 
order of free and fair foreign trade in accordance with the law, 
inspire local governments' enthusiasm, protect the operational 
autonomy of foreign trade operators, and promote the development 
of foreign trade." Some departments have expressed the hope the 
draft will be amended to reflect the fact that economic 
organizations are not the only units engaged in foreign trading 
activities in our country but quite a few scientific research 
institutes have been granted the right to engage in foreign 
trade pursuant to relevant state provisions. To this end, we 
would like to propose the draft be amended to read: "The 
foreign trade operators referred to in this law are legal 
entities and other organizations engaged in foreign trading 
activities in accordance with the provisions of this law." 
  Xiang Chunyi said: The NPC Financial and Economic Committee 
and some localities have noted that although the requirement for 
obtaining the permission of competent departments before 
securing the right to engage in foreign trade confirms the 
practice currently in effect, a registration system should be 
established in light of the long-term demand for reforming the 
foreign trade system. Also, we would like to propose the law 
specify the qualifications of foreign trade operators in order 
to increase its own transparency. Some members and localities 
prefer the draft's provisions on obtaining the permission of 
competent departments before securing the right to engage in 
foreign trade. After canvassing the views of relevant 
departments, the Law Committee concluded that more provisions 
should be introduced regarding the qualifications of foreign 
trade operators. However, considering our country's reality, we 
would like to propose retaining the provisions in the State 
Council's draft regarding the licensing system, and amending the 
draft to read: "A foreign trade operator engaged in the export 
and import of goods and technologies must possess the following 
qualifications, and may only engage in foreign trading 
activities with the permission of the authorities under the 
State Council in charge of foreign economics and trade: 1) 
having its own name and organizational setup; 2) having a 
clearly defined operational scope within which to conduct 
foreign trade; 3) having the premises and funds for carrying out 
its foreign trading business; 4) having professional personnel 
needed for its foreign trading business; 5) possessing actual 
export and import credentials or sources of export and import 
goods; and 6) other qualifications as specified by law and 
administrative rule." "The State Council shall enact 
implementation measures provided for in the preceding 
paragraph." 
  Speaking on the views about amending the draft 
State Compensation Law, Cai Cheng said: Certain departments 
pointed out that, for administrative compensation, there should 
be a specific clause noting that the state shall bear the 
responsibility of compensating for the damage caused by unlawful 
compulsory measures taken on property. We propose this clause 
be added: "When compulsory administrative measures were taken 
to seal, withhold, or freeze property and damage has been made," 
the victim is entitled to compensation. Some Standing Committee 
members noted the draft should have the specific clause that 
authorities obligated to make the compensation should take the 
initiative to pay the victim according to this law. Thus we 
propose a clause should be added to each of the relevant 
articles. Cai Cheng said: Some Standing Committee members 
pointed out that it is not enough simply to make state organs 
personnel -- whose wrongdoings were intentional and serious -- 
bear economic liabilities, but that they must also have their 
administrative and criminal responsibilities investigated. We 
propose, therefore, that this clause be added to the draft law: 
"Relevant authorities shall discipline these personnel 
according to law; and if their wrongdoings constitute a crime, 
their criminal responsibilities shall be investigated according 
to law." 
  Cai Cheng said: Some departments pointed out that 
compensation for detainees, whose legitimate rights and 
interests have been violated as result of the lawless exercise 
of power by authorities in charge of prisons, should also be 
specified in the part about criminal compensation. Some 
departments pointed out that the part about criminal 
compensation should have provisions governing the power of the 
People's Liberation Army's security departments to investigate 
criminal cases in the military. We propose these words in the 
draft law -- "public security organs, security organs, and 
procuratorial organs as well as their personnel" -- be amended 
to read: "Organs exercising investigating, prosecuting, trying 
powers as well as their personnel." 
  Cai Cheng said: Some Standing Committee members and some 
departments pointed out that more flexible rates should be set 
so that they can adapt to wage and price changes in the future. 
We propose the draft version be amended to read: "When a 
citizen's personal freedom has been violated, the daily 
compensation shall be calculated according to the average daily 
wage the state paid him in the preceding year." Many experts 
and local people's congresses and departments pointed out that, 
to facilitate operations, a ceiling should be set for state 
compensation. Some comrades pointed out that the ceiling should 
be set in such a way that it can adapt to future changes. On 
the basis of these views, we propose that a ceiling of 
compensation should be set. The ceiling should be assessed 
according to the state's average wage for workers during the 
preceding year as announced by the State Statistics Bureau. 
Specific rates can be set according to three kinds of 
situations: The reduced amount of income as result of physical 
injury "shall be calculated according to the average annual wage 
which the state paid the worker in the preceding year, and the 
ceiling should be five times the worker's average annual wage 
in the preceding year"; compensation for physical disability 
"should be set according to how much the working capability is 
lost, and the ceiling should be 10 times the worker's average 
annual wage in the preceding year; and in the case of death, the 
total compensation, including funeral expenses, should be 20 
times the average annual wage of the worker in the preceding 
year." Some Standing Committee members, legal experts, and 
departments proposed that the reputation of those whose 
reputation and honor have been infringed upon should be 
reinstated. We propose this clause be added: "When a person's 
reputation and honor has been infringed upon, the organ liable 
for compensation shall, within the area in which the conduct of 
infringement has produced influence, remove the influence on the 
victim, reinstate his honor, and apologize to him." 
  Wang Shuwen reported on the NPC Law Committee's views about 
amending the draft decision on punishing offenses in connection 
with company and enterprise management. He said: In addition 
to prescribing punishments for the offenders -- such as fixed 
prison terms, criminal detention, and deprivation of personal 
freedom -- the draft also provides that "fines may also be 
imposed." Some departments and local authorities pointed out 
that punishments should be based on the offenses' 
characteristics, and the offenders should be deprived of their 
personal freedom and penalized economically. Certain offenders 
may only be fined. Thus, we propose the phrase be amended to 
read: "Fines may be imposed together or separately." 
  Wang Shuwen said: Some members, local authorities, and units 
pointed out that the Company Law's Article 214 provides that 
when a company's directors, supervisors, or managers accept 
bribes, or seize or misappropriate the company's assets, and 
that their acts have constituted a crime, their criminal 
responsibilities shall be investigated according to the law. 
Since the draft decision has no provisions governing bribery, 
it should be supplemented. Thus, we propose this provision be 
added: "When a board director, supervisor, or worker of a 
company uses the convenience of his office to solicit or accept 
bribes, and the amount is quite substantial, he shall be 
sentenced to prison, or criminal detention, of up to five years; 
and if the amount is enormous, he shall be sentenced to prison 
for longer than five years and also have his property 
confiscated. If state functionaries, workers of collective 
economic organizations, or other personnel performing public 
duties commit the aforementioned crime, they shall be punished 
according to the Supplementary Regulations For Punishing 
Corruption and Bribery." 
  He said: Some local authorities and units pointed out that 
the criminal elements stated in this law should not only be 
punished in terms of their personal freedom and economic 
interests, but their credentials for continuing to assume the 
company's leading offices should be restricted. Thus we propose 
this clause be added: "For those who have committed the crimes 
stated in this decision, the people's court may also impose on 
them the additional sentence that they may not assume offices as 
the company's directors, supervisors, or managers, as well as 
other senior supervisory offices for a period from three to five 
years."

  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- The Supreme People's 
Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate separately 
submitted two bills to the seventh meeting of the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC], which opened 
here today, asking it to examine the Draft Law of the People's 
Republic of China on Judges and the Draft Law of the People's 
Republic of China on Prosecutors. 
  In the bill he submitted and in the explanation he made to 
the NPC Standing Committee today, Ren Jianxin, president of the 
Supreme People's Court, said: The purpose of enacting a law on 
judges is to meet the requirements for improving the socialist 
legal system and accelerating the building of a socialist market 
economic structure, to establish a socialist judicial system 
with Chinese characteristics, and to administer judges on a 
scientific and legal basis so as to ensure and upgrade the 
quality of judges and to guarantee that judges exercise their 
trial functions according to law. 
  On the drafting of the law on judges, Ren Jianxin said: The 
Supreme People's Court began drafting the law in 1986, and at 
the end of 1988 the NPC Standing Committee listed the law in its 
legislative plan. In the past few years, the Supreme People's 
Court has conducted extensive investigations and studies, summed 
upexperiences in administering judges since the founding of New 
China, collected data on the relevant judicial systems of 
foreign countries and of Taiwan and the Hong Kong and Macao 
regions, and has sent delegations to study the judicial systems 
in a number of countries. In drafting the law, the Supreme 
People's Court took the Constitution as the foundation, carried 
out the guidelines of the CPC Central Committee on building a 
scientific administrative system that suits the characteristics 
of various units and an effective and encouraging mechanism, 
proceeded from the actual condition in China, took into account 
the future and the current situation, and also studied the 
useful experiences of other countries, in a bid to draw up a 
socialist law on judges with Chinese characteristics. 
  Ren Jianxin said: In China judges are judicial personnel who 
specifically exercise the trial function of the state. They are 
state functionaries as well as professional people. However, 
over the past 40 years, no law has been enacted that reflects 
the dual characteristics of judges, and they have always been 
administered as administrative personnel. Therefore, it is very 
important to enact a law that clearly defines the 
qualifications, responsibilities, rights and obligations, 
selection and appointment, training, evaluation, and 
administration of judges, and rewards and punishment for judges, 
so as to create a system by which judges will be administered on 
a scientific and legal basis. 
  Ren Jianxin also made explanations on establishing a system 
on qualifications of judges, a system on ranks of judges, on 
establishing a judges committee, and establishing a system of 
insurance for judges. 
  In the bill he submitted, and in his explanations to the NPC 
Standing Committee regarding the draft law on prosecutors, Zhang 
Siqing, chief procurator of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, 
said: The purpose of enacting a law on prosecutors is to 
administer prosecutors on a scientific and legal basis, improve 
the quality of prosecutors, and ensure that people's 
procuratorates independently exercise their functions according 
to law. Zhang Siqing said: For a long time people's 
procuratorates' law-supervising function has been affected to a 
certain degree because of the lack of a complete law for 
administering prosecutors. Also, there has been a lack of 
necessary legal guarantees for prosecutors to exercise their 
powers and functions. Therefore, it is necessary to establish, 
through legislation, an administrative system compatible with 
the nature of procuratorial organs and the characteristics of 
their work, such as a system governing the qualifications of 
prosecutors, a system for evaluating prosecutors, and a system 
governing their ranks, wages, insurance, and benefits, so as to 
improve administration of prosecutors on a scientific basis. 
  He said: Enacting a law on prosecutors is necessary for 
ensuring and improving the quality of prosecutors. As 
prosecutors are state judicial personnel exercising the function 
of supervising the law of the country, they must be proficient 
politically and professionally. Therefore, it is necessary, 
through legislation, to make strict stipulations governing the 
qualifications, selection, evaluation, and training of 
prosecutors, so as to facilitate the building of a contingent of 
prosecutors who are fair and honest, and who carry out their 
legal duties according to law. At the same time, the enactment 
of a law on prosecutors is necessary to ensure that prosecutors 
exercise their functions according to law; it is also needed to 
standardize and restrict prosecutors' act of exercising their 
duties. 
  Zhang Siqing also explained the duties of prosecutors, the 
system on qualifications of prosecutors, and the system 
governing the ranks of prosecutors.

  [Text] Beijing, 7 May (XINHUA) -- The Seventh Session of 
the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee 
held successive group discussions over the past few days. 
Standing Committee members present at the meetings examined and 
discussed six draft laws submitted to the current session for 
its consideration. 
  While examining and discussing a draft law on foreign trade, 
most members expressed their opinion that the current draft law 
is relatively complete because it has gone through revisions. 
They expressed their belief that it has the characteristic of 
internationalization; focuses on the implementation of a system 
for unified foreign trade as well as arousing the enthusiasm of 
localities; pays attention to encouraging developed areas' 
foreign trade while stressing the need to support areas 
inhabited by minority nationalities to develop foreign trade; 
and embodies the characteristic of looking after the interests 
of other countries. Therefore, it is conducive to establishing 
China's international prestige and has very important 
significance for the reinstatement of China as a signatory to 
GATT. 
  Members also put forward some opinions concerning revisions 
during their deliberations. Some members expressed their belief 
that the current draft law does not adequately reflect the need 
for deepening the reform of the foreign trade system. Some 
members said that the centralized management of foreign trade by 
the central government is not conducive to bringing into play 
the initiative of localities and enterprises, and that it is 
necessary to appropriately delegate some powers to them. Some 
members expressed the hope that a transition from the permit 
system now in force to a registration system will be completed 
as quickly as possible. Some members stressed: The law 
contains more restrictive and prohibitive provisions; it lacks 
provisions on the development of and a strategy for foreign 
trade. The law should contain specific provisions on 
encouragement and development. 
  As for the draft law on compensation by the state, members 
expressed their belief that the formulation of the law has 
important significance for China to build its socialist 
democracy and legal system; to further protect the legitimate 
rights and interests of its citizens, legal persons, and other 
organizations; to facilitate the performance of duties by state 
organs and their working personnel in accordance with the laws; 
to promote the drive to build a clean and honest government; and 
to develop a socialist market economy. 
  During deliberations, members also put forward their 
opinions 
on revisions of the draft law. Some members pointed out: In 
the realities of life, some victims claimed there were mistakes 
in the handling of their cases and demanded compensation, 
whereas there were many occurrences of organs entrusted with the 
compensation obligation which claimed that no mistake was made 
in the handling of such cases; some cases have dragged on for 
years without a settlement. Therefore, to settle the issue of 
compensation, we need a just and authoritative arbitration organ 
to judge the rights and wrongs of a case. Many members 
expressed different views on the standards of compensation set 
by the current draft law. They expressed their belief that the 
standards of compensation are too low and that the standards of 
computation are unreasonable. Meanwhile, some members maintained 
that economic compensation should be provided for damage to 
one's reputation. There were also some members who stressed: 
The formulation of the law constitutes only one aspect of the 
work. What is more important is that there must be a practical 
guarantee for the enforcement of the law after it goes into 
effect and for the supervision of its enforcement. 
  While examining and discussing a draft resolution on 
punishing criminal activities that violate the management of 
companies and enterprises, draft supplemental provisions to the 
regulations governing penalties for offenses against public 
security, draft revisions of the regulations on military service 
by officers on the active list of the People's Liberation Army 
[PLA] of China, and draft revisions of the regulations on 
military ranks of PLA officers, most members adopted a positive 
attitude toward the need to formulate or revise these laws. 
Meanwhile, they expressed their views and made suggestions on 
some specific provisions contained in these draft laws.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- China's judges launched 
their own forums here today with the establishment of the China 
Association of Judges (CAJ) and the China Association of Women 
Judges (CAWJ). 
  President of the Supreme People's Court Ren Jianxin was 
elected the CAJ chairman and the court's Vice-President Ma Yuan 
heads the CAWJ. 
  China now has over 156,000 judges, including 23,000 women 
judges. 
  The two associations will carry out theoretical research, 
and 
facilitate exchanges and co-operation among judges from all 
parts of the country and at various levels. 
  They will also act as a bridge between judges on the Chinese 
mainland and their counterparts in foreign countries as well as 
in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao.

<F P=106> [By special reporter Ting Yu (3060 7183)] </F>
  [Text] A recent sample survey in Qingdao showed that 
although 86 percent of the respondents were full of confidence 
in the prospects of China's reform and opening up, the support 
of the general public for some policies which are in force or 
will be adopted declined. In the survey items reflecting the 
current conditions of social life, the decline in people's 
satisfaction mainly concentrated in the fields representing the 
costs of economic development and in the fields covered by the 
reform measures to be adopted. This was regarded as a warning 
about rising discontent in society. Over 70 percent of the 
respondents supported greater the political structural reform. 
  The results of the survey, which was conducted by the public 
opinion research institute of the Chinese People's University, 
were made public yesterday. The opinion survey was mainly 
carried out among 1,200 residents of Qingdao at and above 14 
years of age. It was said that the degree of accuracy for the 
survey was 95 percent, and the margin of error was under 3 
percent. 
  The survey showed that as reforms were more intensively 
carried out and the inflation pressure remained high, the living 
conditions of the general public continued to improve in 1993. 
Of all respondents, 71.9 percent expressed satisfaction at the 
current social and political situation; 70.9 percent and 67.8 
percent expressed satisfaction at the economic situation and the 
conditions of cultural life. However, people were deeply 
dissatisfied with public conduct, interpersonal relationships, 
and the relationship between cadres and ordinary people. 
Respondents showing discontent in these areas accounted for 44 
percent, 45.1 percent, and 45.8 percent respectively. The rates 
marked a new high in the relevant opinion polls in recent years. 
Many people were also discontented with price levels and 
product quality. 
  The survey showed that, because some policies being adopted 
recently were not well-coordinated, people's concern became 
deeper and people showed stronger reliance on the state and 
their work units. People generally hoped that they would get 
help in the aspects of retirement insurance, medical insurance, 
and housing. Although people still generally agreed that the 
policies that had been adopted and would soon be adopted were 
"basically feasible" as a whole, the degree of support obviously 
declined. In particular, the degree of support for the price 
policy declined by the biggest margin: People regarding it as 
feasible accounted for only 13.8 percent; those regarding it as 
basically feasible accounted for 43 percent; those regarding it 
as not quite feasible accounted for 16.9 percent; those 
regarding it as infeasible accounted for 10.7 percent; and those 
saying unknown to this question accounted for 15.7 percent. The 
support index declined by 0.45. The support indices of the 
housing reform policy and the public-funded medical service 
policy decreased separately by 0.23 and 0.21. The labor and 
employment policy and the retirement welfare system that have 
not been reformed fully recorded the smallest margins of decline 
of the support indices. 
  Most people hoped that vulgar competition and corruption 
arising in the process of developing the market economy would be 
brought under control. Sixty-five percent of respondents said 
that they were not happy although their living standards were 
enhanced these years. Eighty percent of respondents expressed 
concern over the mainland society's future development. People 
expressing concern over continuing price hikes accounted for 
78.6 percent; those expressing worry about an out-of-control 
economic situation accounted for 64.6 percent; people expressing 
worry about worsening corruption accounted for 63 percent; and 
people expressing certain concern and deep concern over 
aggravated polarization between the rich and the poor accounted 
for 62.5 percent. On the other hand, 73.5 percent of the 
respondents expressed support for pushing the political 
structural reform forward at an opportune moment. 
  Among the indices of people's satisfaction in various 
aspects 
of social life, those related to entertainment and market supply 
slightly increased as compared with the same period of last 
year, but those related to local transportation, environmental 
protection, working conditions, public sanitation and health 
care, and housing conditions all declined somewhat. Statistics 
also showed that older people and poorly educated people were 
comparatively more satisfied with the current conditions. The 
index of satisfaction in the group of illiterate or 
semi-illiterate people was 0.49, but that in the group of people 
having received tertiary education was -0.3. The assessment 
made by soldiers, retired personnel, workers, and self- employed 
laborers was higher the overall assessment level, but that by 
college students, government functionaries, and professionals 
engaged in scientific research, education, and medical services 
was lower than the overall level.

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- China has mapped out an 
ambitious plan to build its own information superhighway with a 
focus on an information application system, a nationwide public 
data service network and an advanced telecommunications network. 
  In a recent symposium on the wide use of information in the 
national economy and China's information superhighway, Wu 
Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications, said China 
will watch closely the world's latest development of the 
information superhighway construction and carry out its own in a 
planned and step-by-step manner. 
  He said China will expand the application of computers in 
digital exchanges and accelerate the construction of optical 
fibers and build an internet by developing a network 
telecommunications platform based on the country's public 
telecommunications network. 
  The symposium, attended by China's senior officials and 
information experts, exchanged information on the world's 
current trend of information superhighway construction, its 
definition and its social economic significance. China's 
demands for such a highway and its potentials were widely 
discussed in the symposium, the first of its kind in China. 
  As part of the effort to cope with the world's new 
information revolution, China is busy building 22 national-level 
optical fiber trunk lines to connect all the provincial 
capitals, 20 digital microwave trunk lines, and large and 
medium-sized satellite telecommunications ground stations. 
  According to government sources, the large capacity digital 
transmission network connecting the country's major provincial 
capital cities will be completed early next year. First phase 
construction of a nationwide digital exchange network was 
completed last September. 
  At present, the network extends to 267 of China's major 
cities and has started to exchange information with 37 centers 
in 20 countries and regions. 
  Meanwhile, the first phase project of the high speed digital 
trunk line connecting 21 provinces and municipalities will be 
put into operation this July. A cellular phone network has 
covered the coastal provinces in the southeast and some central 
provinces. 
  Viewing the current level of information modernization, 
experts said that the 700,000 mobile telephones will be linked 
by a nationwide network soon. China's seven million radio 
pagers have made the country one of the world's largest paging 
markets. Computers have been widely used in banking, customs 
clearance, railway transportation and civil aviation and weather 
forecasting. These, in all, will contribute to China's 
information modernization, experts commented. 
  As another major step in the construction of the information 
superhighway, China plans to accelerate hi-tech research 
concerned with information modernization, especially advanced 
remote sensing, surveying, computers, automation facilities and 
modern telecommunications technologies. 
  The construction of the information superhighway is a 
systematic project which will involve different fields of work, 
said Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications. He 
called on the joint efforts of participating departments to work 
toward erecting the modern information network.

  [Text] Nanjing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- China's first 
environmental protection technology fair opened in Yixing, 
Jiangsu Province, today. 
  The National Environmental Protection Technology Market, 
located in the city's environmental protection science and 
technology park, also opened today. 
  On display during the five-day fair are 500 new materials 
and 
new products from manufacturers across the country. The fair is 
being sponsored jointly by the State Science and Technology 
Commission, the China Environmental Protection Industry 
Association and the Yixing City Government. 
  Included are equipment for treating waste water, purifying 
waste gas and controlling noise, meters and instruments, and 
both Chinese and foreign environmental protection techniques and 
information. 
  Yixing furnishes 15 percent of the annual output value of 
China's environmental protection industry. In 1992 it set up a 
national high- and new-technology industrial development zone -- 
the Yixing Environmental Protection Industrial Park. 
  The National Environmental Protection Technology Market in 
the park serves as a bridge between research institutes, 
manufacturers and dealers.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Gatt Chief's Visit May Open Doors"] </F>
  [Text] Peter Sutherland, who deftly wound up the prolonged 
Uruguay Round of Gatt talks in Morocco last month, is taking on 
what might be another historic task as he undertakes his first 
trip to China this week. 
  As director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (Gatt), Sutherland's impending visit could well be a 
stimulus to China's access to the World Trade Organization, said 
a senior Chinese official. 
  "Although he may not produce a breakthrough in the process 
(of China's re-entry into Gatt), his visit is important in 
itself," Long Yongtu, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), said in an 
interview with Business Weekly. 
  Sutherland was invited by Moftec Minister Wu Yi, and in 
Beijing will attend a high-profile international seminar on 
China's foreign trade development, which runs from Monday to 
Friday. 
  "We attach great importance to Sutherland's visit and regard 
him as a senior adviser to China in its earnest efforts to 
rejoin Gatt," Long said. 
  Although he did not venture to guess what advice Sutherland 
would provide to China, Long said it will be certainly 
"constructive and revealing ones" because Sutherland is a 
seasoned negotiator who has clear understanding of both the 
latest international trade rules and China's particular 
situation. 
  Sutherland's visit comes one and a half months before a new 
round of the Gatt Working Party on China is to be held in Geneva 
and meetings between China and the United States, as well as 
European Community on China's access to Gatt. 
  At the international seminar in Beijing, former U.S. 
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger will lecture on China's trade 
development and on Sino-American relations. 
  "As a mastermind of the establishment of Sino-U.S. 
diplomatic 
relations Kissinger will deliver important speeches which would 
be beneficial to both countries, which are endeavouring to come 
up with a proper pattern of bilateral relations," Long said. 
  Long will be visiting Washington early next month to 
negotiate the terms of China's re-entry into Gatt "We're ready 
to work very hard with our U.S. colleagues, but we do hope they 
will be as practical and realistic as the European Union. 
  "China's priority is to ensure social stability and economic 
development. It will never sacrifice this prerequisite for 
access to Gatt," Long said. 
  The European Union (EU) has recognized that China, with a 
population of 1.1 billion and more than 40 years of a planned 
economy, can not become a market economy overnight. So it has 
agreed to allow China a transitional period following its access 
to Gatt to gradually meet all Gatt rules. 
  He urged all Gatt members to support and facilitate this 
historical transition. 
  "If China undergoes a smooth transition from a planned 
economy to a market one, it will be a great contribution to the 
world in terms of both economic theory and practice," he said. 
  "China has been relentless in its pursuit of economic 
reforms, and has adopted an earnest and down-to-earth attitude 
in its Gatt negotiations," he added. 
  "The fact that China has signed the final act of the Uruguay 
Round of Gatt talks speaks volumes about China's commitment to 
the new multilateral trade rules." 
  Long said that signing the final act "created an important 
condition for China to become a founding member of the World 
Trade Organization." The WTO is to replace Gatt next year. 
  But Long pointed out that China is under no illusions that 
trade protectionism would fade with the new multilateral trade 
regime in place. 
  "We hope the major Gatt contracting parties will commit 
themselves to the new rules and honour fair play," Long said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (CNS) -- The State Council recently 
decided that in the case of Sino-foreign jointly-funded power 
plants, the foreign side is not allowed to ask for a return 
higher than 12 percent for their investment and that excessive 
demands will not be accepted by the Chinese side. 
  Some provinces and municipalities had in the past agreed to 
the demand of too high a rate of return on investment and other 
harsh terms in order to seek an early success for negotiated 
items, such a phenomenon causing the great concern of the State 
Council. 
  The State Council has in principle fixed a rate of return at 
between 11 percent and 12 percent. Demands higher than this 
will not be accepted by the Chinese side. 
  China last year saw RMB 52.2 billion [renminbi] investment 
in 
power construction with newly installed capacity put at 12 
million kilowatts. Some RMB 60 billion capital will be put into 
this sector this year and the newly installed capacity is 
expected to be little bit higher than last year. 
  China now has a per capita provision of 600 kilowatts-hour 
(kwh) while that in the United States is over 5,000 kwh and that 
in Hong Kong, Japan and Britain is more than 2,000 kwhs. China 
is determined to increase its total installed capacity to 1.2 
billion kilowatts in a bid to catch up with the level in medium 
developed countries. 
  Coal-fired, hydroelectric and nuclear power will be 
constructed simultaneously and foreign investment in this sector 
is welcome.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 April (XINHUA) -- The State Council's 
General Office recently issued a circular prohibiting the use of 
renminbi and treasury bond designs on publicity articles, 
publications, and other commodities. 
  The circular says: In March 1991, the People's Bank of 
China, 
the Public Security Ministry, the State Administration for 
Industry and Commerce, the Press and Publications 
Administration, and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television 
jointly issued a "circular concerning the use of the renminbi, 
foreign currency, and treasury bond designs on publicity 
articles, publications, and relevant commodities." This 
circular played an active role in strengthening the management 
of the renminbi and treasury bonds. But the use of the renminbi 
and treasury bond designs on publicity articles, publications, 
and commodities occurs frequently, providing opportunities for 
criminal elements to cheat and disturb financial order. 
  To safeguard the reputation and dignity of the renminbi and 
treasury bonds, the newly issued circular says: Without the 
approval of the People's Bank of China, no units or individuals 
are allowed to print, in any form, certificate or notes 
imitating the renminbi. Nor are they allowed to print renminbi 
and treasury bond designs on publicity articles, publications, 
and other commodities. It is necessary to strengthen the 
supervision and management of printing, publication, movies, 
television, and advertisement units, as well as other commodity 
manufacturers. If publicity articles, publications, and other 
commodities are found to be printed with such designs without 
the approval of the People's Bank of China, they should be 
confiscated immediately and destroyed on the spot. For those 
which have been sold, the illegal income from the sales shall be 
confiscated and a fine of no more than the sale income shall be 
imposed. Personnel directly in charge of this activity or 
involved in this activity shall be investigated. 
  The circular urges that all localities and departments 
should 
conscientiously organize inspections, that press units should 
conduct propaganda campaigns, and relevant units should 
strengthen their supervision and management so as to stop the 
misuse of such designs.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (CNS) -- Conditions are not mature 
enough for foreign-funded banks to run renminbi business at the 
present stage considering that the commercial banking system had 
not yet been set up, the Deputy Director of the Securities 
Committee under the State Council and Vice Chairman of the 
Securities Supervisory Commission Mr. Tong Zengyin said. 
  With China now engaged in restructuring of the banking 
system, it will take time for the state-owned professional banks 
to switch to state-owned commercial ones. Unfair competition 
would result from letting foreign-funded banks undertake the 
renminbi business at a time when the commercial banking system 
had not yet been established. The way in which foreign-funded 
banks ran their business and the taxation rate for these banks 
were different from those for domestic banks at the present 
stage. 
  Mr. Tong said that the opening of banking business to 
foreign- funded banks had to be in line with the national 
situation. China employed the practice of letting 
foreign-funded banks undertake foreign currency business first 
and then went step by step to have them involved in the renminbi 
business. He added that there would not be an overall opening 
in such sector. Some areas including Shenzhen and Xiamen can 
take the lead in opening themselves to the outside world. The 
number of state-owned medium- and large-sized enterprises is 
relatively small in these places where the market economy system 
plays a dominant role and most banks operating there are 
commercial ones. They are therefore qualified for opening the 
banking business to the outside world to a greater extent. The 
time, however, is not ripe for the running of the renminbi 
business by foreign-funded banks at the present stage until the 
banking system is well established.

  [Text] Beijing, May 6 (CNS) -- China will find it much 
more difficult in getting rid of its foreign trade deficit this 
year, according to a projection made by the member of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference and head of the study group for 
restructuring the foreign trade system Mr. Wei Yuming. 
  Mr. Wei pointed out that some factors would have an effect 
on 
export growth in foreign trade this year. 
  First, the shortage of capital places foreign trade 
enterprises in a difficult position while they will also find it 
rather difficult in obtaining loans from banks. Capital for the 
purchasing of export commodities is inadequate. 
  Second, domestic prices are going upwards leading to a rise 
in prices for export commodities, a phenomenon also affecting 
overseas businessmen's confidence in China's commodities. 
  Third, the world economy is seeing a slump and the overseas 
market is not brisk. 
  Following the release of rights to foreign trade to a lower 
level since last year, according to Mr. Wei, relevant work has 
been done in the wake of necessary adjustments during the past 
year. Banks have also tried their best to lend support to such 
trade. China is ready to set up import and export banks which 
will be advantageous to the foreign trade target set for this 
year. 
  The most difficult period in the course of the restructuring 
of the foreign trade system is something of the past, Mr. Wei 
said. The new problem, according to Mr. Wei, mainly lies in the 
exploitation of a diversified market in a bid to let foreign 
trade enterprises develop into large groups as well as 
preventing the drainage of talented personnel from this sector.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (CNS) -- Vice President of the 
People's Bank of China, Mr. Yin Jieyan, disclosed at a national 
working meeting on laws and regulations recently held by the 
People's Bank of China in Nanning at four financial laws such as 
the law of the People's Bank of China would be implemented. 
  Mr. Yin said that the four draft laws drawn up by the bank 
had been submitted to the State Council for discussion and 
examination last year and were expected to come into effect in 
the latter half of this year. They are "Law of the People's 
Bank of China", namely the Law of the Central Bank, the "Banking 
Law of the People's Republic of China", namely the Law of 
Commercial Banks, the Law on Insurance" and the Law on Bills". 
  Mr. Yin said that with the rapid development of China's 
economy and the implementation of reform measures regarding the 
financial system, financial legislation had been put on the 
agenda. Among the four laws, the "Law of the People's Bank of 
China" was aimed at upholding stability of the value of the 
renminbi and the smooth operation of the financial market and 
financial business as well as improving the financial system to 
promote economic development. The law provides for the People's 
Bank of China to set up a currency policy committee to stabilize 
the value of the renminbi and prevent inflation. The "Banking 
Law of the People's Republic of China" was created with the aim 
of regularizing the conduct of commercial banks.

<F P=106> ["Economic Reference Forum" article: "Steadily Push Forward </F>
Banking Reform"] 
  [Text] The risks of banking reform are not as great as 
those involved in fiscal reform and can be pushed steadily 
ahead. The guideline for banking work this year remains: 
"Continuing to rectify the banking order, steadily advancing 
banking reform, strictly controlling the gross amount of credit, 
and effectively strengthening banking supervision and 
management." The regulations laid down last year have achieved 
great results, but should be further implemented this year, 
because many things have not been completed and have not been 
thoroughly solved. In addition, three requirements have been 
set for work this year. 
  First, control the scale of investment in fixed assets by 
all 
possible means. In order to control the overall scale of 
investment, we must control the amount of bank credit offered to 
fixed-assets investment projects. Solid results must be 
achieved in this regard. The State Planning Commission will lay 
down an overall quota, and bank branches in every province must 
be subject to such quantitative limitations. The overall 
quantitative limit must not be exceeded by even one yuan, 
because this has a bearing on the national economy and the 
destiny of the nation. The scale of investment is already very 
large, and has gone beyond the capacity of our national 
strength. Therefore, the task for the banks this year is to 
tightly control the scale of fixed-assets investment. If they 
fail to do this, there will be big trouble in the overall 
situation of the national economy. 
  Second, our specialized banks should be turned into 
commercial banks, and the first step will be taken this year. 
This will just be one step in the long process and is not a 
step which will complete the whole process. If no further loans 
are given to enterprises which operate in the red and fail to 
repay their debts, there could be unrest in society. There are 
still many such problems. Therefore, banking reform this year 
will only take a first step. We can consider how to run 
commercial banks in such circumstances. In general, however, 
the supply of working capital may be loosened, but lending for 
fixed assets must be strictly controlled. Loans for working 
capital may be arranged more flexibly and financial support 
should still be given to enterprises which can achieve 
satisfactory economic results. Some enterprises that cannot 
achieve good economic results still cannot be allowed to go 
bankrupt immediately, and appropriate financial support should 
still be given to them according to the opinions of local 
governments. However, products cannot be just stockpiled in 
warehouses. This year, pilot schemes should be carried out in a 
number of provinces, and bankruptcy experiments can be carried 
out first in a number of enterprises in every province. 
Bankruptcy should be arranged for enterprises that have been 
operating in the red for a long time and cannot stop incurring 
losses after full preparations have been made, because if more 
loans are given to them, this will just increase their unpaid 
debts. After bankruptcy, their assets can be auctioned and the 
enterprises reorganized. 
  Third, the People's Bank of China should actually transform 
its functions and should really exercise banking supervision. 
The functions of the bank must be changed, and this was the aim 
of the reform we carried out last year. In the past, the 
People's Bank was keen to directly arrange loans. Loans 
throughout whole provinces were distributed by the People's 
Bank. This confused the functions of the central bank and those 
of the commercial banks. At present, the People's Bank no 
longer performs such a function, because it has to perform a 
more important function. It is not responsible for arranging 
even a small percentage of credit and does not involve itself in 
the distribution of credit-making quotas. It just plays its 
role as the central bank in exercising overall banking 
supervision and in keeping overall monetary order in every 
locality. 
  At present, it is necessary to pay attention to preventing 
some people's irregular fund-raising activities after credit has 
been brought under strict control. Irregular fund-raising 
activities and the irregular setting up of financial 
institutions cause high interest rates and disruption to the 
monetary order. Thus, the People's Bank is responsible for 
carrying out inspections. Problems discovered should be checked 
immediately and made known to all banks in the country. No 
loopholes can be left in this field; otherwise, things could go 
out of control. At present, some people just think that a 
modern enterprise system can only be the joint-stock system 
established through internal fund-raising means, with bank loans 
withdrawn. Then, what should the banks do? If all enterprises 
distributed large amounts of dividends to their workers or keep 
the profits in their hands own rather than depositing them with 
the banks, the banks will have no deposits and the state will 
have no money to arrange necessary capital construction. 
Therefore, it is necessary to organize and increase deposits. 
The People's Bank must change its functions and must 
impartially fulfill its supervisory task by checking 
interest-rate battles, savings battles, and irregular 
fund-raising activities based on high interest rates as soon as 
these things are discovered.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Foreign Exchange Deposits Up"] </F>
  [Text] Individual foreign exchange savings in the Bank of 
China (BOC) have surpassed $10 billion. 
  Although specific figures are not available, an official 
with 
the bank said BOC depositors usually account for about 65 per 
cent of the country's total individual foreign exchange savings. 
  The official said bigger foreign exchange savings give the 
bank more capital for supporting domestic and foreign-funded 
ventures. 
  The official said the bank's individual savings have been 
accelerating since the beginning of last year. 
  In the past 16 months, deposits have risen by $4 billion, an 
average of $250 million a month. 
  The official attributed the high growth to the country's 
opening to the outside world, which has given Chinese more 
access to foreign exchange. 
  Domestic institutions and firms have assigned more people to 
work in overseas affiliates, and more labourers have been sent 
abroad on engineering projects. 
  Meanwhile, more Chinese residents have gone abroad to study 
or tour the official said. 
  The foreign exchange they bring back is the major source of 
the Bank of China's individual savings. 
  The official noted that more foreigners and residents of 
Hong 
Kong, Macao and Taiwan have entered the Chinese mainland. Part 
of their foreign exchange usually flows to relatives and friends 
in the mainland. 
  Furthermore, Chinese self-employed businessmen usually put 
their money in banks in the name of individuals instead of firms. 
  All these have created wider sources of foreign exchange. At 
the same time, though, limits remain on how foreign exchange can 
be spent, thus ensuring healthy bank deposits. 
  Although the China Investment Bank has permission to sell 
$50 
million worth of foreign-currency bonds to individual Chinese, 
these bonds have not yet been issued. 
  With few alternatives for spending their foreign currency, 
many Chinese prefer to put the money in banks even though the 
interest rate is relatively low compared with renminbi deposits. 
  Although the bank has raised the interest rate for foreign 
exchange accounts three times this year, the rate for one-year 
fixed-term savings in U.S. dollars is still only 4.3125 per 
cent, compared with 10.98 per cent for renminbi. 
  The official said the devaluation of the renminbi has also 
induced Chinese to put their foreign exchange in banks to 
protect its value. 
  The Bank of China started its individual foreign exchange 
savings in 1984. Its more than 8,000 outlets accept savings in 
six currencies: U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar, British pound, 
Deutsche mark, Japanese yen and French franc.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The Bank of China (BOC) 
announced here today that private savings in foreign exchange in 
the bank exceeded 10 billion U.S. dollars by the end of April 
this year. 
  The figure is a net increase of four billion U.S. dollars 
over the end of 1992, when the total personal foreign exchange 
deposits in the bank totaled 6.09 billion U.S. dollars. 
  According to BOC spokesman Zhu Chi, the increase in private 
hard currency savings has averaged 250 million U.S. dollars per 
month since 1993, compared with an annual growth of one billion 
U.S. dollars between 1990 and 1991, and 1.4 billion U.S. dollars 
in 1992. 
  Zhu attributed the eye-catching growth to the increased 
entry 
and exit of citizens resulting from the country's expanded 
policy of opening to the outside world. 
  Remittances from residents' overseas relatives constitute 
another rich source of foreign money held by those residents on 
the mainland. 
  However, Zhu noted, the BOC's deposit policies play a 
positive role in attracting hard currency savings. 
  When the bank began to accept personal deposits in 1984, 
depositors could not withdraw their money at will. The 
restriction was removed in 1985, and a 100-percent increase in 
deposits was witnessed the following year. 
  To encourage personal savings, the bank grants preferential 
rates for big sums and long-term foreign exchange deposits. 
  As a state bank specializing in foreign currency and foreign 
trade, the BOC now sets the deposit interest rates on behalf of 
the People's Bank of China, the central bank. The interest 
rates closely follow the rates on the international financial 
market. 
  With the recent rise in the interest rates on the U.S. 
dollar 
in world capital markets, the bank has raised the rates 
accordingly eight times in a row since the start of 1994. 
  At a result, the one-year deposit interest rate for U.S. 
dollars now stands at 4.3125 percent, as compared with 2.75 
percent at the end of last year.

  [Text] Beijing, May 6 (CNS) -- According to statistics 
from an authoritative department, by the end of last March, the 
individual savings deposits of both urban and rural residents 
reached RMB [Renminbi] 1662.7 billion, bringing individual 
capital assets in the country to over RMB 2,700 billion. 
  Other than savings deposits, individual capital assets also 
include cash owned by residents of over RMB 460 billion which 
makes up 80 percent of the renminbi currency in circulation in 
addition to cash of over US$13 billion, national debts of nearly 
RMB 100 billion and several hundred billion renminbi of various 
kinds of internal money-raising, stocks and bonds. 
  Financial experts here held that the big growth of 
individual 
capital assets indicated the gradual enrichment of varieties of 
monetary items, the continuous increase of channels for 
investment and the flourishing trend of the financial industry.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Hongyang (3076 3163 3152)] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- In issuing an 
announcement here on 18 April regarding the official 
establishment of the China Foreign Exchange Trading Center, Zhu 
Xiaohua, vice president of the People's Bank of China and 
director of the State Administration of Exchange Control, said: 
Our country's foreign exchange reserves have increased 
substantially this year. 
  Speaking at a no-frills opening ceremony, he said: Since 1 
January, our country has implemented a new foreign exchange 
control system. People in all circles at home and abroad have 
fully affirmed this practice. Over the past three months or so, 
we have successfully unified exchange rates, keeping the 
renminbi's exchange rates generally stable throughout and 
striking a basic balance between supply and demand on the 
foreign exchange market. We have kept foreign exchange trading 
conduits relatively free for all types of enterprises, thereby 
basically guaranteeing enterprises' reasonable demands for 
foreign exchange. 
  He said emphatically: Because of the influx of foreign 
capital, the growth of imports, and the expansion of foreign 
exchange receipts from nontrading sources such as tourism over 
the past three months, our country's foreign exchange reserves 
have grown by a record margin in both absolute and relative 
terms compared to the corresponding periods in past years. 
  On the significance of establishing the China Foreign 
Exchange Trading Center, Zhu Xiaohua said: The official 
operations of this establishment will serve Chinese- and 
foreign-funded banking institutions, as well as banking 
institutions funded jointly by Chinese and foreign investors, in 
balancing their surpluses and deficits in foreign exchange, and 
they will provide a reliable guarantee for the nationwide 
circulation of foreign currencies and for foreign exchange 
settlements in banks; they will also provide an effective market 
facility for improving the mechanism for shaping exchange rates, 
for implementing a unified and managed floating rate system 
based on market supply and demand, and for gradually making the 
renminbi freely convertible. 
  According to the relevant experts, foreign exchange trading 
and clearing on this unified national foreign exchange trading 
market, which formally went into operation on 4 April, has been 
basically normal over the past two weeks.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (CNS) -- The State Administration 
Bureau for Industry and Commerce has decided to further open its 
businesses in seven ways: 
  -- Financial enterprises having the needed requirements are, 
with prior approval, allowed to run non-financial enterprises 
with their own capital and to invest in other industries. 
  -- Non-production and diversified companies with capital of 
RMB 200 million [renminbi] or more and trust and investment 
companies as well as companies engaging in project construction 
with capital of RMB 100 million are permitted to engage in real 
estate development and management. 
  -- Management of commercial enterprises and goods and 
materials supply and marketing enterprises will further open and 
such enterprises will be allowed to do wholesale, retail, 
purchase and sale on commission business. 
  -- Information and consultancy companies which are related 
to 
scientific and technological advancement and run or jointly run 
by scientific and technological personnel and various kinds of 
collectively-run technological services enterprises will be 
allowed to be registered. 
  -- Economic entities run by redundant staff of party and 
government organs, who have cut off their connections such as 
names, financial and personnel affairs with such organs, can 
apply for registration. The redundant staff involved in these 
entities are not allowed to retain their posts in the 
above-mentioned organs, nor to use the names of their original 
units or to engage in businesses in the capacity of party or 
governmental cadres. 
  -- Grass-roots institutions such as agricultural technology 
stations and medical stations for farm animals are allowed to be 
registered after examination. Their businesses can be managed 
in the way of enterprises and are allowed to run production, 
processing and consultancy service entitles. 
  -- Foreign capital is encouraged in setting up tertiary 
industry and those businesses banned in the past will be, 
through trial, gradually opened like land development, 
large-sized retail industries, transportation, finance and 
tourism. In addition, the procedures set for registration 
approval for foreign investment enterprises will be further 
simplified and unnecessary approval set for special items will 
be canceled.

  [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Making good use of the 
international equity market is China's long-term strategy and 
more Chinese firms can expect to go public on overseas stock 
markets in the future. 
  "Overseas listing will become one of the main vehicles for 
China to attract foreign capital in the years to come," said Nie 
Weiping, deputy director of the Overseas Department under the 
China Securities Regulatory Committee, the country's top 
securities administrative body, at a symposium on public 
relations for China's overseas listings. 
  He said that investors from the developed countries have 
begun to actively participate in trading Chinese or 
China-related equities after years of watching and pondering. 
  "Their enthusiasm is a great help to us in entering the 
international capital market," said Nie, adding that the 
securities authorities are seriously considering expanding 
Chinese firms' presence on the world financial market to seek 
more foreign investment via such means as launching China funds 
as well as issuing convertible bonds. 
  The significance of overseas listing, however, lies in 
accelerating the process of enterprise reform which aims to 
enhance productivity and make these firms consistently 
profitable. 
  According to Nie, the seven Chinese firms already listed on 
the Hong Kong market have all reported remarkable improvements 
in management and economic efficiency. 
  They have expanded production as they used the funds raised 
through stock issues to purchase advanced technology and 
equipment. 
  The fund raised by the seven firms totals an estimated 10.5 
billion H.K. [Hong Kong] dollars. 
  And the yearly profits of these firms have all exceeded the 
projected figures in their statements for public stock offering, 
said Nie. 
  The symposium, co-sponsored by the China Securities 
Regulatory Commission and Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, 
features presentations on listing mechanisms and public 
relations support for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the New York 
Stock Exchange, and European investor roadshows and discussions 
on ADRS [expansion unknown]. 
  Experts from major world banks, investment corporations, 
auditing firms and public relations companies will have detailed 
exchanges with the 40-odd Chinese firms seeking overseas 
listings.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The China National 
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) has worked out a new strategy 
to build itself into an international conglomerate in the near 
future. 
  A CNOOC official today revealed that under the new strategy 
the corporation is to develop itself into an international 
conglomerate with multinational oil companies as its backbone, 
within a time span of five years. 
  The future conglomerate will also embrace a series of 
solely-funded subordinates with limited responsibility and a 
number of share-holding companies, he said. 
  This marks a big step for CNOOC, the only state firm in 
charge of China's offshore oil and gas exploration and 
development, to rid itself of the drawbacks of the planned 
economy and get used to the fledgling market economy. 
  The official said CNOOC will continue to expand co-operation 
with the outside world and seek more domestic investment in the 
exploration and development of offshore oil and gas. 
  Meanwhile, he said, the corporation will speed up the 
expansion of its overseas business and activities, adjust its 
industrial structure and incorporate upstream and downstream 
operations. 
  Multiplying the trades and the sources of investment will 
surely speed up as well as upgrade the development of the 
corporation, he asserted. 
  Founded in 1982, CNOOC has, over the past 13 years, 
attracted 
about 3.8 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment and signed 
94 contracts with 55 companies from 15 countries. 
  By the end of last year, the corporation, together with 
foreign partners, had proved 1.2 billion tons of oil in place 
and developed and built 11 oil and gas fields. 
  It is expected to produce 12 million tons of crude oil and 
four billion cu m [cubic meters] of natural gas in 1997, 
according to the estimation of experts. 
  However, CNOOC, which now has 12 subordinates, believes that 
bank loans being the only source of investment has caused a 
chronic short supply of exploration funding. 
  It also blamed the static industrial structure for the 
corporation's incompetency in dealing with possible risks. 
  In addition, the changes in China's macro-economic climate, 
with the reform of the systems of taxation, foreign exchange and 
investment in particular, have weaned the company from most of 
the state's preferential treatment it used to enjoy. 
  Wan Yan, president of CNOOC, said: "We must find a good way 
out to complete the transition from the planned economic system 
to the market economic system so that we are able to achieve new 
and even greater developments, from a new starting point."

<F P=106> [From "Chinese Economic News" Column: "Regulations on </F>
Responding to Foreign Accusations About Dumping"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Corporation promulgated the "Regulations on Responding to 
Foreign Accusations About Dumping" not long ago to resolve the 
issue of weak responses to the implementation of anti-dumping 
cases overseas, protection of legitimate rights of Chinese 
production and export enterprises, and maintenance of exports 
market. 
  Based on the regulations, when Chinese products are accused 
of having been dumped, the respondant should be 1) the 
enterprise who has the right to operate in foreign trade, whose 
products are being targeted in dumping cases and exported to the 
country or region that lodges the accusation during the period 
of investigation; and 2) the enterprise that manufactures the 
exports referred to in the aforesaid clause. It is stipulated 
that all export-and-import chambers of commerce and associations 
for foreign-funded enterprises are to be in charge of organizing 
and coordinating the response to foreign accusations about 
dumping; at the same time, special persons should be appointed 
to take charge of such cases. Under specific conditions, local 
commissions for foreign economic relations and trade, when 
authorized, may be in charge of organizing the response to 
foreign accusations about dumping, too.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "GE to Invest $500m in New Projects in </F>
China"] 
  [Text] General Electric Company (GE), a U.S.-based 
multinational industrial giant, is planning to take a bigger 
slice of the Chinese market for its twelve major business units. 
  "We will invest approximately $500 million more in China 
over 
the next three to five years," said Jeffrey Gannon, President 
and CEO of GE China in an exclusive interview with CHINA DAILY 
over the weekend. 
  The figure excludes investment by GE Capital, a specialized 
investment arm of the company, which has total assets of more 
than $211 billion. 
  GE Capital has over $1 billion invested in Chinese aircraft 
and container leasing operations, which it has run for several 
years. It is planning to upgrade its representative office into 
a wholly owned branch later this year, Gannon said. 
  GE plans to set up seven major new enterprises in China, 
either wholly owned or in joint ventures, by 1996. 
  They will be in the areas of lighting, plastics, 
locomotives, 
hydropower, gas and steam turbine generators, appliances, and 
financial services. 
  "We are planning for the next 100 years in China, and we 
want 
to be a Chinese company, an insider of the Chinese economy," 
Gannon said. 
  The best way to achieve that goal is to localize GE's 
business in China, he explained. 
  Despite the dispute between China and the United States over 
the most favoured-nation (MFN) issue Gannon said GE has decided 
to increase its presence in China "without hesitation. 
  "We have confidence in this country and, even without MFN, 
there will be significant trade flow between GE and China." he 
said. 
  According to him, the withdrawal of MFN will have a 
short-term impact on GE's business in China, but the company is 
looking at the Chinese market on its own merits. 
  GE has reached final agreement with a partner in Shanghai 
and 
is awaiting approval to set up what will be China's largest 
lighting manufacturing plant. GE will hold the majority 
interest. 
  Gannon said a certain part of the joint venture's products 
will be exported to balance its foreign exchanges. 
  GE has also set up a wholly owned plant in Guangdong 
Province. The construction of the facility started 1 April. 
  The plant, which involves a $50 million investment from GE, 
will be the first to produce hi-tech engineered plastics in 
China when it comes on line . 
  GE is also negotiating to form a joint venture for local 
service and training for its aircraft engines sold in China. 
  To date, GE has captured about one-third of the Chinese 
aircraft engine market. Gannon predicted that the share could 
increase to more than a half in the near term. 
  As for the power sector, GE is planning to localize the 
production of gas and steam turbine generators, as well as hydro 
equipment. 
  "We expect GE's annual sales (plus orders) in China to reach 
more than $2 billion by 1996 or 1997, up from $1.1 billion last 
year," he forecast.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Capital Spending Speeds Up"] </F>
  [Text] China's fixed assets investment might grow faster 
than the government's target this year of nearly 10 percent, the 
State Information Centre said. 
  Xu Hongyuan, an official with the centre's economic 
forecasting department, predicted that investment in fixed 
assets this year might hit 1,500 billion yuan ($172.4 billion), 
up nearly 27 percent from a year ago. Last year, capital 
spending grew by 50.6 percent from 1992. 
  Xu believes the higher level is needed because the current 
market demand is very much related to fixed assets investment, 
which is also a major factor in maintaining high economic growth 
in the future, as the government has envisaged. 
  After a careful study of economic developments and in light 
of growing confidence that inflation will be kept at bay, 
economists now believe that demand should be spurred a little 
bit more than what was targeted at the beginning of this year. 
  The centre, an arm of the State Planning Commission, 
believes 
this could be done through larger fixed assets investment. 
  By doing so, Xu said, the gross national product (GNP) could 
expand by 11 percent this year, 2 percentage points higher than 
what was envisaged at the start of 1994. 
  The latest statistics show that while inflation and fixed 
assets investment are moderating, personal savings and official 
revenues are growing rapidly. 
  The year-on-year increase in fixed assets investment was 
36.2 
per cent in March, down 34.5 percentage points from a year 
earlier. 
  The yearly growth in capital spending is expected to subside 
to about 32 per cent by June, down 29 percentage points from a 
year earlier. 
  Individual savings in the country's banks are currently 
186.2 
billion yuan ($21.4 billion) higher than last year. 
  In addition, the government had already withdrawn 3 billion 
yuan ($345 million) in currency during the first quarter of this 
year. 
  The growing savings and the government's active money 
withdrawal have helped curtail inflation, which slipped 1.4 
percentage points from March to April. Xu said he believed that 
despite the rising prices of some agricultural products, the 
current market demand is generally weakening compared with the 
growing supply of goods, which may dampen factory production as 
well as economic performance. 
  He also explained that the inflationary pressures that have 
cast a pall over the economy are mainly side-effects of the 
price and tax reforms of last year, and should gradually fade in 
the months to come. 
  As a result, the State Information Centre believes that the 
growth in fixed assets investment is reaching an acceptable 
level because consumer spending relies on the stimulus of fixed 
assets investment. 
  But, he added that the government should keep a watchful eye 
on the growth in fixed assets investment, which customarily 
peaks in the fourth quarter.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "CNPC Looks Abroad for Oil Business"] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese petroleum industry is broadening its 
global business horizons by consolidating old footholds in some 
countries and establishing new ones elsewhere. 
  The China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) says its overseas 
operations are advancing as scheduled. 
  In the meantime, it says, conditions are suitable for 
opening 
new areas for petroleum exploration and development. 
  In an interview with Business Weekly, Zhang Yongyi, CNPC's 
vice-president, cited the example of old oil wells in Peru that 
have been upgraded by Chinese technicians and are now producing 
more oil. 
  CNPC signed a contract with Petrol Peru last year for 
further 
development of a 182-square-kilometre block in an old oilfield. 
Production at the oilfield, which was discovered in 1874, has 
declined after more than 100 years of exploitation. 
  CNPC, which produces some 140 million tons of crude oil a 
year, has mature technology and enough equipment for enhancing 
oil recovery, Zhang said. 
  In a couple of North and Latin American nations, CNPC is 
conducting seismic work, Zhang revealed. 
  In Thailand, CNPC has made progress in developing oil. 
Another CNPC official said Chinese are doing preparatory work 
for constructing an oilfield. 
  In Papua New Guinea, CNPC will explore for oil in one block 
code- named 160 and another named Kamusi. CNPC is teaming up 
with companies from Japan and Hong Kong in the exploration. 
  After leading a business group to the Central Asian nations 
of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan last 
month, Zhang said new fields for cooperation will be opened 
there. Zhang was travelling with a Chinese Government 
delegation headed by Premier Li Peng. 
  Zhang believes prospects for Chinese co-operation with the 
four republics are good since the needs of all five countries 
are complementary. 
  Two letters of intent for closer ties were signed by CNPC 
and 
the petroleum sectors of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. 
  More co-operation is expected in the exploration, 
development 
and trade of crude oil and natural gas. 
  According to the letters of intent, technical exchanges and 
visits to oilfields will be more frequent than before. 
  CNPC and Turkmenistan reaffirmed their desires to work 
together, along with the Japanese industrial conglomerate 
Mitsubishi, to develop natural gas. 
  Construction of a pipeline is being considered to carry 
natural gas from Turkmenistan to Japan by way of China. Gas 
resources in Turkmenistan are estimated at 20,000 billion cubic 
metres. 
  Zhang cited several advantages for CNPC in improving 
petroleum cooperation with Central Asia: 
  -- Proximity, which ensures convenience in co-operative 
exploration, development and trade; 
  -- Chinese technology, engineering and experience, which 
suit 
the needs of the four nations; 
  -- Similar economic and social conditions, which enhance 
mutual understanding as the five countries make the transition 
from rigid central planning to market economies.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "Forums Set To Drum Up Investment"] </F>
  [Text] In the next few months China is to launch a series 
of high-profile trade forums overseas to attract investment 
worldwide. 
  These forums, mostly organized by the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec), are the Chinese 
Government's latest response to foreign investors gripped by 
"China mania." Late this month, Moftec will orchestrate a 
massive trade delegation that will visit Hong Kong to promote 
investment. 
  The promotional trip will be the first to Hong Kong 
organized 
by Moftec. 
  But officials declined to give details about the Hong Kong 
forum. 
  Local analysts said the trade forum takes on added 
significance as it follows the issuance of HK$3 billion (US$380 
million) in Hong Kong bank notes by the Bank of China. 
  From June 1 to 9, Moftec Vice-Minister Gu Yongjiang will 
head 
another big delegation to Australia to promote trade and 
investment. The delegation, of around 200 people from 20 
provinces and cities, will leave on May 30 and return on June 11. 
  "More than 500 Chinese projects (seeking Australian 
investment) will be announced in Melbourne from June 1-3 and 
Sidney from June 7- 9," said an official with the foreign 
investment administration of Moftec. 
  Of the projects, 53 involve infrastructure; 428 are in 
manufacturing; 18 in agriculture, forestry and husbandry; 17 in 
services; three in science; and one in research. 
  Australia hopes to be further integrated into the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  Through last year, Australia had pledged some $1.3 billion 
to 
1,310 projects in China. The actual input was $338 million. 
  This makes Australia one of the top 10 overseas investors in 
China. During the Australian visit, the China National 
Technical Import and Export Corp and the China National 
Machinery Import and Export Corp will seek to facilitate imports 
and exports, Moftec officials said. 
  From late May to early June, Moftec Minister Wu Yi will lead 
a delegation to Japan to discuss bilateral trade and investment 
opportunities. 
  Besides attending a meeting with the Japanese Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, Wu will attend a conference in 
the capacity of Chairperson of the China-Japan Investment 
Promotion Committee. 
  Wu's visit comes at a time when more Japanese companies, 
such 
as NEC, Mitsubishi and C. Itoh, are seeking more business with 
China. 
  Last year alone China approved 3,488 projects involving 
$2.96 
billion worth of pledged Japanese investment. The actual input 
was $1.32 billion. 
  By 1993 Japan's total promised investment in China was $8.86 
billion in 7,182 projects. The actual input was $5.17 billion. 
  Moftec will also organize a large trade and investment 
delegation to Italy and France late next month, officials 
revealed. 
  Altogether 100 people from 14 provinces and cities will 
offer 
330 projects for investment. The projects mainly cover 
chemicals, foodstuffs, machinery, leather, light industry, 
textiles, building materials and medicine.

  [Text] The nation's top securities regulator has urged 
listed companies to standardize their operations in accordance 
with national regulations and laws. 
  Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory 
Commission, said that as the country's stock market matures the 
role of public companies in the development of the securities 
industry gains importance. 
  He said the companies, which are pioneers in China's 
shareholding reform and the establishment of a modern corporate 
system, must strictly obey regulations because their every 
action can arouse great attention from the public. 
  "Standardized operation of the listed companies is the 
foundation for a stable and healthy development of the stock 
market," he said. 
  Liu said that if a stock market pays little attention to 
companies' illegal practices, serious speculation will appear 
and endanger the stability of the market. 
  "To a certain degree, the quality of the public companies is 
of vital importance to the future of China's stock market and to 
the confidence of shareholders," he said. 
  Meanwhile, Liu pointed out that standardizing the operations 
of public companies is also a prerequisite for access to the 
international securities markets. 
  With more international financial institutions shifting 
attention to China, there are more opportunities for Chinese 
enterprises to enter the international securities markets. 
  But this also requires companies to improve their 
performance 
and bring their operations in line with international practices, 
he said. 
  In addition, Liu said standardized operations also represent 
a basic way for listed companies to establish a good image among 
shareholders, raise their credibility and improve market 
competitiveness. 
  He said that although listed companies have done much 
already, many problems persist, such as: 
  -- Rights and responsibilities among companies' 
shareholders, 
directors and senior managers are not defined clearly; 
  -- Some companies blindly expand their shares and capital to 
mask poor management; 
  -- Some companies, unaware of disclosure requirements, don't 
release information properly; 
  -- Some even make major decisions without authorization.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 8 (XINHUA) -- China's securities 
business is expanding along with the country's rapid economic 
growth. 
  According to preliminary statistics, employees in government 
securities administrative, business and service departments top 
50,000 at present. 
  The State Council's Securities Committee, the China 
Securities Regulatory Commission and provincial securities 
administration departments have at least 1,000 staff members 
each. 
  They have drafted a package of securities laws and 
regulations in coordination with legislatures to ensure the 
healthy development of China's securities markets. 
  Opened to service since 1990, the Shenzhen and Shanghai 
Stock 
Exchanges have continuously upgraded their telecommunications 
and technology facilities to boost their business. 
  So far the two exchanges have issued 250 types of A-shares 
and 50 B-shares. 
  They have about 1,000 members, who have opened some 2,000 
securities business departments in more than 300 cities. These 
departments employ at least 40,000 people. 
  In addition, China has ten newspapers and magazines 
specializing in securities, and over 1,000 newspapers, and radio 
and television stations which carry columns or programs on 
securities. 
  Consultancy services, and computer and software companies 
specializing in securities are mushrooming across the country. 
  A survey report shows that the transactional volume on 
China's securities markets last year amounted to 374 billion 
yuan. They delivered one billion yuan in profits to the state 
last year.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Technology Transfer Increasingly Sought"] </F>
  [Text] China, stands poised to enter the global economy by 
exchanging more technology with foreign companies. 
  This aspiration was expressed in Beijing yesterday by Ren 
Jianxin president of the Supreme People's Court, in his speech 
to 400 participants of the Licensing Executives Society (LES) 
International Conference. 
  LES International, established in 1974 in San Francisco, is 
a 
global non-governmental body specialized in the study and 
promotion of technology trade that covers the transfer of 
copyrights, trademarks, patents, know-how and trade secrets. 
  United Nations estimates predict the world's technology 
trade 
will hit $230 billion in 1995, compared with $50 billion 10 
years ago. 
  "The world's economic trend has provided many Asian 
countries, including China, with an excellent opportunity to 
develop their own national economies," Ren said. 
  "Technology transfer and licensing, closely linked with 
economic development, shall have broad prospects in a region 
with great vitality." 
  Between 1979 and 1993, China struck over 7,000 technology 
trade contracts with foreign countries valued at almost $48 
billion, according to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Co-operation. 
  Last year alone saw 493 technology import deals worth $6.11 
billion and 141 technology export deals worth $2.15 billion. 
  The imports included large equipment, licensing, technical 
services and consultancy for product design, technique and 
manufacturing know-how. 
  Ren also noted that China has developed a sound legal system 
for protecting intellectual property rights. 
  China's rewritten Patent Law and Trademark Law has offered 
extended protection. Copyright protection has also been brought 
into line with international norms, and the security of trade 
secrets has been stipulated in the Anti-Unethical Competition 
Law enforced in December 1993.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Si Liang (2448 5328): "The Results of </F>
Implementing the Mainland Enterprise Bankruptcy Law Are Not 
Satisfactory Enough"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 18 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the 
"PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy Law" came into force in 1988, it has 
created the conditions for setting up the legal framework of 
enterprise management and the new enterprise system. However, 
the results of implementing the bankruptcy law in the last five 
to six years have not been satisfactory enough. Some contents 
of the law are now unsuited to the situation whereby the 
structure has been changing into the market economy in recent 
years and different ownership forms are coexisting. It is said 
that the authorities are now considering a substantial revision 
of the bankruptcy law. 
  According to incomplete statistics, in the five to six years 
of implementing the bankruptcy law, only some 1,000 enterprises 
applied for bankruptcy. A large number of these enterprises 
were under collective ownership, state-owned enterprises only 
accounting for a small proportion. In addition to such 
objective factors as changes in market conditions, the 
enterprises went bankrupt mainly because of problems in their 
internal management. For example, their self-control mechanisms 
were not working; their accounts were not in order; they were 
short of working funds; their products were of inferior quality; 
they concealed business losses or incurred losses through lack 
of experience or being taken in; and they had been running in 
the red for a long time through poor management and had failed 
to repay their debts. 
  What has perplexed people is the fact that many state-owned 
enterprises which were running in the red for a long time, and 
living solely on state financial subsidies, did not apply for 
bankruptcy. Reportedly, this year, one-third of several hundred 
million state-owned enterprises will incur overt business losses 
[ming kui 2494 5719]; another one-third will incur covert 
business losses [qian kui 3383 5719]; and only the remaining 
one-third will show small profits. The mainland department 
concerned recently investigated some state-owned enterprises 
which were running in the red in six provinces and reached the 
conclusion that at least 30 percent of state-owned enterprises 
should go bankrupt. In fact, the number of enterprises having 
applied for bankruptcy accounted for just 0.001 percent of the 
total number of enterprises on the mainland. This shows that 
the results of the bankruptcy law's enforcement were not 
satisfactory enough. As a rule in market competition, 
enterprises having lost their vitality and failing to survive 
should be eliminated; however, a large number of enterprises 
which have been running in the red for a long time are now 
unwilling to apply for bankruptcy and still rely on government 
subsidies for their continuing existence. This is indeed a big 
problem. In fact, the implementation of the "PRC Enterprise 
Bankruptcy Law" has encountered many difficulties. First, some 
government departments were worried that, beacuse the social 
insurance system was not perfect enough, if a large number of 
enterprises were allowed to go bankrupt then a large number of 
workers would become jobless and it would be hard to arrange new 
jobs for them, adding an unstable factor to society. Second, 
most of the loss-making enterprises were floated by bank loans, 
so the banks did not want to see that their loans would never be 
recovered if the enterprises went bankrupt, because, as the 
banks said: "Bankruptcy will just shift the losses onto the 
banks." As the money loaned by the banks came mainly from 
ordinary people's deposits, if a bank also goes bankrupt, 
society would experience major turmoil. Therefore, the banks 
would rather see the enterprises indefinitely in arrears with 
debt payments than having the debtors go bankrupt. Third, the 
bankruptcy of a large number of enterprises will inevitably 
bring about a chain reaction because debt chains exist among all 
enterprises. If one enterprise goes bankrupt, other enterprises 
with business relations will suffer serious losses. In 
addition, as some enterprises play a major role in processing 
local resources, if they go bankrupt the development of local 
resources will be seriously affected. 
  All this shows that the implementation of the bankruptcy 
law, 
especially for state-owned enterprises, is facing mountains of 
difficulties. However, if the bankruptcy law cannot be 
implemented smoothly, the situation will be unfavorable to the 
new round of enterprise property rights reform beginning this 
year to establish the modern enterprise system and aslo to the 
further development of the market economy. 
  In order to force more state-owned enterprises which have 
been running in the red and failing to repay debts go bankrupt 
as they should do, the authorities are adopting some measures to 
deal with the difficult points. One of the measure was to set 
up a system of keeping tens of billions of yuan in reserve funds 
in the banks to cope with bad debts and make up for the losses 
caused by enterprise bankruptcies. This year, 7 to 8 billion 
yuan will be assigned to 15 cities, including Shanghai and 
Shenyang, to offset bad debts appearing in pilot schemes of 
enterprise bankruptcy. Another measure was to set up a 
foundation for workers losing their jobs in enterprise 
bankruptcies. Each worker will be given about 20,000 yuan as 
redundancy compensation so that they can pay the living costs 
while remaining jobless. It is expected that a new breakthrough 
may be made this year in the number of bankruptcy application 
cases among loss-making enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing, May 6 (CNS) -- Minister of the State 
Planning Commission, Mr. Chen Jinhua said at a forum on 
macro-economy in China that marked achievements had been made in 
the process of strengthening and improving decisions for 
macro-control and adjustment but tasks in this sector still 
remained arduous. 
  Mr. Chen said that a series of policies regarding the 
strengthening and improving of decisions for macro-control and 
adjustment adopted by the party central committee and the State 
Council last June had effectively curbed the overheated and 
disordered economy in the country, creating better conditions 
for reform and opening to the outside world as well as for 
economic development. In the first quarter of this year, the 
investment growth of state-owned units dropped to 37.2 percent 
from 57 percent in the same period last year. The financial 
situation in the country had also shown a favorable turn with a 
turn of net cash withdrawal in the first quarter of this year 
from the net cash input in the same period last year. Financial 
confusion such as rampant money collecting and illegal issuance 
of inter-bank loans had been basically curbed and the national 
economy continued a better momentum of increase. 
  Mr. Chen said that certain marked problems existing in 
economic operations had not yet been thoroughly solved and the 
strengthening and improvement of macro-control and adjustment 
remained an arduous task. The serious problems facing the 
present economy was the soaring inflation. [as received] 
  The reasons for such inflation could be analyzed from 
various 
angles, Mr. Chen said. The main reason was too much social 
demand and overly big investment scale exceeding the national 
power in particularly. At present the local authorities planned 
to further expand their investment scale with the expectancy 
that macro-control measures would be relaxed in the latter half 
of this year. 
  Mr. Chen said that it was very necessary to further unify 
ideas and increase consciousness to carry out macro-control and 
adjustment measures.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- China has made 
substantial progress in construction of the "pillar industries", 
which have been designated to promote a high-speed, steady and 
healthy economic development. 
  In the beginning of the 1990s, the Chinese Government worked 
out a plan to vitalize the industries of machinery, electronics, 
petrochemical industry, automobile and construction, and 
gradually make them pillar industries capable of driving the 
development of the whole economy. 
  Sources from related departments show that in the past few 
years, these industries have generally maintained fairly high 
development speed, with their output value constituting a 
considerable part in the gross national product. They have also 
made significant breakthroughs in technical advancement, scale 
economy and some other aspects. 
  An official from the Ministry of Machinery said that in 1993 
the machinery industry finished a total output value of 360 
billion yuan, an increase of 24 percent over the previous year. 
  The output of mechanical equipment needed by the state's key 
construction projects has been largely increased, the research 
of key technical equipment has made smooth progress, such as the 
home- made 300,000-kw and 600,000-kw thermo power generating 
units, the cold and heat continuous rolling mills and blast 
furnace of the second-phase project of Baoshan Iron and Steel 
Company, which have reached the internationally advanced level. 
  The country's electronics industry has begun its effort to 
organize large enterprise groups, in a bid to develop new and 
high- tech products with joint investment. In this aspect the 
ministry has already experienced success in building "Hualu" -- 
an ambitious video-corder production base, of which the 
first-phase project, capable of producing 1.5 million sets of 
key parts, became operational at the end of last year. 
  So far, computers have been used in more than 20 industries 
including banking, railways, civil aviation, building materials, 
metallurgy, commerce and tourism, and the number of computers 
being used has exceeded 1.5 million. 
  China's auto industry has been taking shape in recent years, 
with construction of the state's eight key production bases 
going smoothly and the output capacity rising fast. In 1993 the 
country's total auto output reached 1.28 million, up 20 percent 
from the previous year. 
  The auto industry has introduced more than 200 items of 
technology in recent years, while at the same time making active 
efforts to increase the proportion of home-made parts. To date 
the proportion of home-made parts in "Santana" produced in 
Shanghai has exceeded 80 percent, while that of "Cherokee Jeep" 
in Beijing, "Peugeot" in Guangzhou and "Xiali (Charade)" in 
Tianjin have all exceeded 50 percent. 
  As a result of improved quality, some China-made auto parts 
have already been exported. 
  To make sure that the plan of "pillar industries" 
construction be fulfilled, the related ministries have all 
drafted special industrial policies to define the key points to 
be developed. 
  For machinery industry, the key points are complete sets of 
equipment for transportation and energy, and basic machinery 
parts; for the electronics industry, they are integrated 
circuits, computers, telecommunications equipment and modern 
domestic appliances. 
  The key parts for the construction industry are residential 
houses, public facilities and industrial buildings, while that 
for the auto industry are sedan cars, light trucks and auto 
parts.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by correspondent Zhong Min (6988 2404) ] </F>
  [Text] Retail prices in the first quarter of this year 
rose 21 percent from the same period last year, eight percentage 
points higher than last year's average increase of 13 percent 
and far higher than the hoped-for "10 percent rise in annual 
retail price increases" the State Council vowed to achieve early 
this year. Although market supply in the mainland remains 
stable, inflation will become this year's greatest problem, 
slowing down various reforms and economic development. 
  Figures from the State Statistics Bureau show an average of 
more than 25 percent price increases from the same period last 
year in the first quarter in 35 cities across the country, with 
Haikou (34 percent), Urumqi (30.6 percent), and Nanjing (30.1 
percent) as the top three. Even Beijing's 24 percent, 
Shanghai's 23.3 percent, and Guangzhou's 24.3 percent, which are 
lower than average, are higher than the national average. 
  In general, when the inflation rate in a country rises 
higher 
than 20 percent, dire consequences inevitably follow: economic 
recession, serious losses and factory shutdowns, massive 
unemployment, panic buying in the market, and other such chaotic 
phenomena. But Western experts are surprised to find that none 
of the above have happened in mainland China, where market 
supply has remained normal. 
  The truth is, incomes in the mainland rose even higher 
during 
the steep price hikes. Figures provided by the State Statistics 
Bureau show that the income of township and town residents in 
the first quarter of this year rose an average of 31.1 percent 
from the same period last year, a net growth of 9.3 percent 
allowing for price increases. Another survey showed that 
increases in urban residents' income came mostly from bonuses, 
allowances, part-time jobs, and extra money from odd jobs. This 
explains why people have been able to withstand soaring price 
increases. 
  However, constraints and the negative impact of inflation 
are 
being felt in various areas in the mainland. Mainland experts 
pointed out: First-quarter GDP grew 12.7 percent from the same 
period last year, of which total industrial output value grew 16 
percent from the same period last year. A large increase in 
fixed- assets investment was the primary engine of economic 
growth, of which fixed-asset investment by state-owned 
enterprises alone increased 36 percent from the same period last 
year. This, plus the 50 percent or more increase in 
fixed-assets investment last year, was a massive dose of new 
investment which generated a tremendous pull on goods, and, in 
turn, social demand and supply, forcing up prices for raw 
materials, energy, and transport and, therefore, enterprises' 
production costs, which in turn raised prices for daily 
necessities. Experts estimate that fixed-assets investment this 
year will rise by about 25 percent to 1,500 billion yuan, higher 
than the State Council's projected 1,300 billion. Inflation 
will inevitably worsen if fixed-assets investment runs beyond 
the scale set by macroregulation and control. 
  According to official announcements, increased bank lending 
in the first quarter amounted to 35.1 billion yuan and was 
mainly fueled by increased lending for working capital and 
fixed-assets investment. Expansion of the credit scale has 
undoubtedly been one of the causes of deteriorating inflation. 
  What merits attention is the continued drop in production 
efficiency among state-owned enterprises in the first quarter of 
this year. Close to 50 percent of these enterprises are losing 
money, and they absorbed 15.7 billion yuan of government 
subsidies. Because these loss-sustaining enterprises will not go 
bankrupt, all wages, bonuses, and allowances were paid as usual, 
in effect turning government subsidies to these enterprises into 
bank loans and bonds, while there was no respite in social 
consumption power. Such a situation only drives inflation ever 
higher. 
  Price deregulation, rising procurement prices for 
agricultural products, and adjustments in petroleum and coal 
prices since last year, together with price increases by shops 
taking advantage of tax reform, are no doubt related to the 
price hikes. The recent tightening of price management by 
provinces and cities might cool things down to some extent. 
However, if we cannot maintain control over the two big valves 
of fixed-asset investment and the scale of credit, it will 
continue to be difficult to curb rising prices and the 
inflationary trend.

<F P=106> [By Guan Anping, director of the Beijing-based Anpingcheng </F>
Law Firm: "Old Contract Laws Need Repair To Fit Into New 
Reality"] 
  [Text] China needs to work out a new set of contract laws 
compatible with international practice so as to better serve the 
market economy. 
  China's contract laws, written during the years of a planned 
economy, cannot meet the new demands. Under changed realities, 
many articles contradict each other. 
  And China has different contract laws for domestic and 
foreign trades, as well as for different businesses. This no 
longer complies with the demand of a unified domestic market, 
which will become an integral part of the world market. 
  Different economic contract laws for domestic and foreign 
trades are designed by developing countries to protect their 
weak industries. 
  But as China is now preparing to re-enter the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and to fully participate 
in international business activities, the dual-standards are 
apparently out of date and detrimental to the establishment of 
the market economy. 
  Overseas investors find these dual-standards increasingly 
troublesome. When they co-operate with Chinese partners in 
export and import, they are to abide by a foreign contact law; 
when they establish joint ventures with Chinese firms, they have 
to abide by domestic contract law. 
  This creates much inconvenience for foreigners wishing to 
trade and invest in China. 
  The same is true with the technological contract laws. 
  The overseas technological contract law applies to domestic 
business people that import overseas technologies and their 
foreign suppliers, while the domestic technological contract law 
concerns deals between domestic business people. Due to the 
inconsistency of the two laws, the role of science and 
technology in promoting productivity has been limited. 
  Besides even now China does not have a law stipulating the 
export of technologies. 
  Also the contract laws and regulations in various areas -- 
such as civil engineering, property insurance, sales of 
agricultural and industrial products -- have mainly been drafted 
by different departments who follow significantly different 
principles. As a result, they can hardly form a coherent system. 
  In another respect, as the laws tend to deal with 
principles, 
they are not easy to be implemented. They need to be more 
detailed. 
  The inconsistency and administrative nature of the country's 
old contract laws will surely reduce the vitality of enterprises 
and hinder the competition between them. 
  Contracts play a vital role in the market economy. The 
allocation of resources, such as commodities services funds 
human resources and information, are all realized through 
contacts. Contract laws are fundamental to business dealings. 
  To ensure the role of contracts in resource allocation and 
the country's smooth re-entry into Gatt, China must work out a 
new set of contract laws. 
  To draft the new laws, China should follow the principles of 
the contract laws of Britain and the United States, the Gatt, 
the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
Goods (1980), the Principle for International Commercial 
Contracts and other international codes on foreign trade. 
  Britain and the United States have accumulated rich 
experience in this field. Also as a commercial language, 
English and its legal terms have been very popular in the world 
business community. 
  If China refers to the contract laws of the two countries, 
its contract laws will be more detailed and much closer to 
international standards. 
  Amended contract laws are likely to be convenient for 
overseas business people and reduce business disputes. 
  China should study the demands of the Gatt and make the new 
contract laws comply with the Gatt's basic principles of free 
trade, eliminate trade barriers and improve the protection of 
intellectual property rights. 
  China's new set of contract laws can be written into a 
statute book composed of general principles and specialized 
contract laws. 
  The general principles should be based upon the general rule 
of the civil law, economic contract law and the overseas 
economic contract law and the above-mentioned foreign contract 
laws. 
  The specialized laws should also reflect the spirit of the 
various foreign laws. For example, the drafting of the new 
regulations concerning the contract guarantee should refer to 
the Uniform Rules for Contract Guarantees Publication. 
  If China can adopt the advanced achievements of other 
countries in formulating the new set of contract laws and forge 
a strict logical link between the general rules and the specific 
articles, its competitiveness in the international market could 
be strengthened and its legislative level will be greatly 
upgraded.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- China produced 210.9 
billion kwh [kilowatt hours] of electricity in the first quarter 
of this year, about 10 percent more than the same period of last 
year. 
  According to the Ministry of the Power Industry, this figure 
is 24 percent of the planned annual target of 890 billion kwh. 
  Of the total, 183.4 billion kwh were produced by thermal 
power plants and 27.5 billion kwh by hydroelectric power 
stations. 
  An official from the ministry said eight power grids along 
the coast produced more electricity than the six others in the 
interior. 
  Despite the increase, the power supply is still far short of 
demand. 
  By the end of last year China's power generating capacity 
had 
reached 181 million kw and another 12 million kw will be added 
this year. 
  China plans to add 16 million kw of generating capacity 
every 
year from 1995-2000 so as to bring the country's total 
generating capacity up to some 300 million kw by the turn of the 
century. 
  The Ministry of Power Industry expects another ten percent 
increase in power production in the second quarter.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhu Jianhong (2612 0494 5725) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Tang Hong (0781 5725)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- Since China started the 
production permit system 10 years ago, the system has fully 
played its role of ensuring good quality products and helping to 
implement industrial policies. Li Chuanqing, State Bureau of 
Technological Supervision director, announced recently: In the 
future, the production permit system will be applicable to fewer 
products -- only the products which are subject to government 
policy restrictions --, and the number of restricted products 
will be reduced to around 100 from more than 280 at present. 
  With the brisk market in China in the early eighties, a 
large 
number of poorly equipped, poorly staffed, and poorly managed 
enterprises emerged in China. Their products were inferior, 
frequently causing bad accidents. In April 1984, the State 
Council promulgated the "Interim Regulations on Production 
Permits for Industrial Products" which is applicable to 
important industrial products. 
  Over last 10 years, the enterprises operating with a 
production permit have generally raised their awareness of 
quality, improved basic work, and effectively ensured good 
quality of their products. According to incomplete statistics, 
enterprises in Shanghai's electronics industry alone had to 
invest a total of nearly 10 million yuan in buying production 
and testing instruments and improving the production environment 
before they were given a production permit. Better technology 
remarkably improves the quality of products. For instance, 
motor-driven threshers and fire extinguishers caused many deaths 
and injuries before the start of the production permit system, 
and much less accidents have been caused by them since the start 
of the system. According to State Bureau of Technological 
Supervision statistics , the up-to-standard ratio of products 
subject to the production permit control averaged approximately 
50 percent before an enterprise obtained a production permit, 
and the ratio has increased by 30 percentage points after the 
enterprise obtained the permit. The production permit system 
has effectively improved the management of various trades. For 
instance, the issuance of production permits has enabled the 
cement industry to know more about its enterprises. While more 
than 6,000 cement enterprises have obtained production permits, 
some 1,000 small plants have been eliminated due to poor 
production conditions. So, the overall technological level of 
the cement industry has been raised. 
  While practicing the production permit system, the State 
Bureau of Technological Supervision and other departments 
investigate and punish the controlled products produced without 
a permit, so as to protect the consumers' interests. For 
instance, disposable syringes are a product concerning human 
life. More than 2,000 households in a Jinxian County town in 
Jiangxi Province, were aroused to produce them, and most of them 
did not have the necessary technology, equipment, or test 
instruments. Their substandard products caused many bad medical 
accidents. Working together, the State Bureau of Technological 
Supervision, the State Pharmaceutical Administration, and 
departments concerned with Jiangxi Province have destroyed 600 
sets of inferior products, closed down more than 300 factories 
which operated without a permit, and have begun to stop the 
trend of production without a permit.

  [Text] Beijing, 6 Apr (XINHUA) -- Our country has made new 
headway in judicial administrative work. Last year, it achieved 
new results in improving legal and legal protection services, as 
well as in serving the needs for deepening reform, opening wider 
to the outside world, and developing the socialist market 
economy. 
  It has been disclosed that by the end of 1993, more than 
66,700 people were engaged in law-related work across the 
nation, up 46.3 percent from 1992. Of these, more than 30,400 
were full-time lawyers, a 37.4-percent increase over 1992 which 
represented the fastest growth since the counsel system was 
reinstituted in 1980. Law organizations have also proliferated. 
By the end of 1993, the number of law offices across the 
country exceeded 5,100, a 22.8- percent increase over 1992 which 
represented the largest growth in years. Of these, 502 law 
offices were not covered by state staffing and funding plans, a 
150-percent increase over 1992. 
  Lawyers' workload in providing legal services to clients and 
in serving as intermediaries in the market also increased 
significantly in 1993. By the end of 1993, lawyers across the 
country served as regular legal consultants to more than 185,800 
organizations, enterprises, institutions, and citizens, up 22.6 
percent from 1992. Lawyers represented their clients in more 
than 483,300 civil and commercial cases, up 21.9 percent from 
1992, and handled more than 18,400 law cases involving 
foreigners, up 25.2 percent from 1992. 
  It has been disclosed that new progress was also made in 
notarial service across the country in 1993. By the end of 
1993, the number of notarial offices totaled 3,066 nationwide, 
85 more than in 1992. Notarial offices or their representative 
offices were set up in some bonded zones and economic 
development zones. There were 167,000 notaries public of all 
types. Notarial cases of all types concluded throughout the 
year totaled 7.96 million, 3.42 million of which were related to 
the economy. 
  It has been disclosed that prisons and reform-through-labor 
institutions across the country held more than 1.244 million 
criminals by the end of 1993. More than 247,000 criminals had 
their sentences reduced in the same year because they showed 
concrete signs of repentance and performed meritorial services 
while serving their terms; more than 33,000 criminals were 
released on parole and another 34,000 or more were freed on 
medical parole. In the same year, more than 301,000 people were 
released upon completing their prison terms.

  [Text] Yinchuan, May 7 (XINHUA) -- China has started its 
two-year-long nationwide survey and supervision of desert lands. 
  This was released today by officials attending an on-going 
national desertification meeting in this capital city of 
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. 
  During the past few years, China has made progress in 
bringing some desert areas under control. However, deserts 
still keeps expanding, Zhu Guangyao, vice-minister of forestry, 
said at the meeting. 
  Zhu attributed the problem to the fact that the state has 
not 
gotten hold of the overall situation of the country's 
desertification conditions and on-going treatment of desert 
lands. 
  As a result, the state cannot make corresponding decisions 
immediately and correctly, the vice-minister said. 
  He said that this will be the first time for China to 
conduct 
such a comprehensive and detailed survey and supervision on the 
desert areas across the country. 
  Using scientific analysis, experts will first ascertain the 
shrinking and expanding situations of deserts comprehensively, 
correctly and immediately. 
  The campaign will be carried out in all the mainland's 30 
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, including 680 
counties and 7,630 townships in total. 
  Charts and data will be made at the levels of townships, 
counties and provinces to illustrate the contemporary 
desertification conditions. 
  The central government has put much emphasis on the survey 
and supervision of desert lands ever since 1990 when China began 
preparatory and pilot work in desert treatment, the 
vice-minister said.

<F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "State To Focus on Rural Water Projects"] </F>
  [Text] The government will accelerate efforts to ensure 
clean drinking water in rural areas, a State official said 
yesterday. 
  Better water should improve health standards and boost 
economic development, experts say. 
  Zhou Wenzhi, Vice-Minister of Water Resources, said 300 
million yuan ($34.5 million) has been invested this year in 
water works projects, aiding 200 million people in 40,000 rural 
townships nationwide. 
  And the amount of money, including 200 million yuan ($23 
million) in bank credits and 100 million yuan ($11.5 million) in 
subsidized loans, will increase, he said. 
  In the next few years, special funds are to be earmarhed for 
large scale water projects and overseas investment is to be 
sought. 
  The move is needed to meet the needs of growing townships. 
  Over the years the number of farmer-run rural enterprises 
has 
skyrocketed, attracting millions of surplus labour [as 
published] and causing such problems as air and water pollution. 
  It is estimated the population in such towns will reach 250 
to 300 million by the end of the century. 
  The ministry has completed more than 7,000 water supply 
projects in the last few years, improving the quality of life 
for more than 15 million people and accelerating economic growth 
in rural areas, Zhou said. 
  Projects this year, an expert said, will provide one ton of 
clean running water per month to farmers in areas with polluted 
water supply. [sentence as published] 
  This is vital because polluted water has been directly 
linked 
to poor health standards and slow economic development. 
  According to Zhou, many young people from the countryside 
fail militaly checkups due to having drunk polluted water. 
  "It is of vital importance to the government's efforts to 
improve the health of the Chinese people," he said. 
  Over 200 million of China's 900 million people in rural 
areas 
live in more than 2,000 counties and 40,000 townships. 
  But only a minority have access to running water. Many must 
fetch water from nearby rivers, small reservoirs, ponds and 
wells. 
  Nevertheless, these townships have developed into economic, 
political and cultural centres since China's reforms began in 
the late 1970s. 
  Official statistics show the gross value of industrial 
output 
in rural township enterprises hit a record 1.3 trillion yuan 
($150 billion) in 1992, a third of the country's total. 
  And the figure has increased 30 times the amount in 1978, 
Zhou said. 
  With such continual development, more water supply projects 
for rural residents are needed, Zhou said.

  [Text] Nanjing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- A publicity drive in 
China's economically advanced province of Jiangsu has helped 
enhance local people's sense of protecting patent rights. 
  An official of the provincial patent administration said the 
number of people who applied for patent rights has increased at 
an average of 20 percent a year over the past decade. 
  To ensure the healthy development of patent application and 
protection, Jiangsu has worked out more than 20 local 
regulations and rules on patent rights. 
  In addition, it has carried out patent implementation in 793 
enterprises on a trial basis and set up a specialized research 
institute. 
  The official noted that the administration had received 
21,918 patent applications by the end of last year, and approved 
11,456.

  [Text] Beijing, May 8 (AFP) -- An explosion at a coal mine 
in southeastern China has claimed 38 lives, marking the gravest 
accident so far in what is fast becoming the worst safety year 
on record for China's coal industry, the Legal Daily said Sunday. 
  The accident occurred May 1, when a gas explosion ripped 
through a mine in Jiangxi province, killing 38 miners instantly, 
the newspaper said, adding that initial investigations had 
attributed the disaster to poor management and sub-standard 
safety procedures. 
  Following the blast, the Ministry of Coal convened an 
emergency meeting May 5 to discuss the recent series of 
disasters that has afflicted the industry and issued an urgent 
call for stricter adherence to safety regulations. 
  A total of 724 miners have died in accidents in the first 
three months of this year alone, compared with 1,058 for the 
whole of 1993. 
  Following an emergency meeting of labour and coal officials 
in February, nearly 2,000 mines in the northeastern province of 
Heilongjiang were closed to allow for the upgrading of safety 
equipment and the replacement of inadequately trained safety 
staff. 
  A recent government circular accused local authorities of 
being soft on officials found responsible for mining accidents. 
Failure to give "harsh and timely" punishments was one of the 
main reasons for the alarming rise in the number of deaths and 
injuries, the circular said.

  [Text] Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, convened a forum in Jinan on 5 May with the 
participation of factory directors and managers of 12 
enterprises from across the province to commonly discuss how to 
successfully invigorate large and medium-sized, state-owned 
enterprises. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: All levels of party committees and 
governments should truly pay attention to invigorating large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises by putting the endeavor in 
this regard in an even more important and conspicuous position. 
Such enterprises should depend on in-depth reform and greater 
vitality to forge ahead continuously with a view to again 
creating brilliant achievements. 
  Recently, Jiang Chunyun has convened forums one after 
another 
on the issue of invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises and has gone deep into enterprises to conduct 
investigations many times. The 5-May forum was held amid a warm 
atmosphere. At that forum, factory directors and managers of 12 
enterprises introduced their experiences and methods and offered 
some good opinions and suggestions for successfully running 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. 
  At that forum, Jiang Chunyun pointed out: For a long time, 
our large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises have made 
tremendous contributions to developing the province's national 
economy and have vigorously supported the progress of reform and 
opening up as well as the modernization drive, thus becoming a 
major and key force on which the province has depended to 
maintain stability and promote development. In establishing the 
socialist market economic structure, the foundation lies in the 
modern enterprise system with public ownership as the mainstay. 
In developing the socialist market economy, the main force lies 
in large and medium-sized state- owned enterprises. The success 
in invigorating large and medium- sized state-owned enterprises 
has a bearing on the overall situation of the entire party and 
the whole country and on the superiority of the socialist system 
where public ownership is the mainstay, thus is very important 
both in the economy and politics. Leaders at all levels must 
list the endeavor of invigorating large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises as a major item on their daily agenda 
and actually pay attention to this work until results are 
achieved. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The current situation in the 
province's large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises can be 
summarized as follows: Achievements are great, problems are 
numerous, and the future is bright. At present, the state is 
adopting a series of measures to invigorate large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and such enterprises 
themselves also have the superiority of being furnished with 
good technological equipment and high-quality cadres, staff, and 
workers. Therefore, we should not only face up to unfavorable 
factors but also catch sight of favorable factors and 
conditions, enhance confidence, and carry forward the spirit of 
advancing despite difficulties in an effort to walk out of the 
plight as quickly as possible. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: The fundamental way to invigorate 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises lies in the 
efforts to further deepen enterprise reform, accelerate the 
establishment of the modern enterprise system, and change from 
the planned economic structure to the socialist market economic 
structure. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: To invigorate large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we should pay attention to 
renewing and upgrading their products, increasing the content of 
science and technology of products, and enhancing the 
competitiveness of their products on markets. In addition, we 
should pay attention to following the road of integration to 
develop a number of transregional and transprofessional large 
enterprise groups, with large and mediums-sized state-owned 
enterprises as the mainstay, and with integrated property rights 
as the main link. We should pay attention to improving 
management, enhancing internal skills, tapping our potentials, 
and foster the idea of quality first, beneficial results first, 
and efficiency first. We should also pay attention to building 
the ranks of workers and wholeheartedly depend on the working 
class.

  [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- A recent opinion poll 
shows that most Chinese urban residents are satisfied with the 
country's current political, economic and cultural conditions. 
  The results of the opinion poll, which were released here 
today, also show that most city people agree that "building a 
socialist market economy has brought benefits to the Chinese 
people". 
  The poll was conducted by the research institute of public 
opinion of Beijing's People's University last December among 
1,200 families in Qingdao, a coastal city in east China's 
Shandong Province. 
  Among the 2,795 people who answered the questionnaires, 75 
percent said that their diet had "improved" or "improved 
obviously"; 71 percent said their clothing and daily necessities 
had improved. 
  Some 89.9 percent said they were "satisfied" or "rather 
satisfied" with market supplies; 60.9 percent said the same 
thing about their recreational life; 61 percent were happy with 
middle and primary school education; 50.5 percent were pleased 
with the public health situation; and 76.5 percent were 
satisfied with the state of power and water supplies. 
  About the current political, economic and cultural 
conditions, 84.2 percent agreed that "the socialist market 
economy has instilled vitality into society and brought benefits 
to the people". 
  Some 86.4 percent said they were "full of confidence about 
the country's reform and opening to the outside world". 
  The poll also indicates that many urban residents are not 
satisfied with housing, prices, services, product quality and 
urban transportation. 
  A total of 51.2 percent said they were "dissatisfied" or 
"rather dissatisfied" with their housing conditions; 62.4 
percent said the same about the current level of prices; 64.4 
percent were not satisfied with product quality; 51.4 percent 
expressed dissatisfaction with services; and 55.3 percent were 
unhappy with urban transportation. 
  The people who answered the questionnaires included Army 
officers, retired people, factory workers, private businessmen, 
government officials, university and middle school students and 
housewives. 
  Looking ahead to the next five years, 71.7 percent said that 
they were "optimistic" or "rather optimistic" about the 
improvement of their diet; 47.8 percent were "optimistic" or 
"rather optimistic" about improvements in housing. 
  The poll also shows that 61.6 percent of Chinese people have 
become tolerant about the widening gap between the poor and the 
rich. 
  Some 69.7 percent said that they no longer have to behave 
"very carefully" when they want to change their way of life.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Maodi (7115 3029 1717)] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, 6 May (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, president of China, and 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, inspected work in 
Shanghai from 26 April to 6 May. He went deep to grass-roots 
units to conduct investigations and studies on issues concerning 
reform, opening up, economic development, and social stability, 
and to seek opinions on a wide range of issues from people from 
various sectors. 
  Accompanied by Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai 
Municipal CPC Committee; and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, Jiang 
Zemin inspected some large and medium state-owned enterprises 
and met with some enterprises' factory managers (managers) to 
discuss issues concerning establishing a modern enterprise 
system on a trial basis. Jiang Zemin stressed large and medium 
state-owned enterprises' important position and role in building 
and developing a socialist market economy, pointing out that the 
underlying way to improve large and medium state-owned 
enterprises is to further deepen reform, transform enterprises' 
operating mechanisms, and build a modern enterprise system. He 
said that Shanghai was in a good position to establish a modern 
enterprise system on a trial basis. He urged the Shanghai 
Municipal CPC Committee and government to continue to create a 
good environment and conditions for enterprise reform, and to 
make positive efforts to study ways to transform government 
functions, improve the management of state assets, improve 
enterprises' internal management, build a social insurance 
system, refine the market system, and reduce enterprises' 
excessive burden so that work on establishing a modern 
enterprise system on a trial basis can be carried out in an 
organized and systematic manner. 
  At a meeting with leading cadres of some districts, 
counties, 
bureaus, and enterprises of Shanghai to discuss issues on 
strengthening party building, Jiang Zemin said that we should 
pay great attention to strengthening party building and 
improving the party's leadership throughout the process of 
reform, opening up, and modernization. He urged party 
committees at all levels to earnestly study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and to further ensure that this fundamental 
ideological work is carried out properly. He said: We should 
uphold and refine the party's system of democratic centralism, 
pay attention to selecting and educating young cadres, reinforce 
and improve the building of grass-roots party organizations, and 
increase the party's rallying power and combat capabilities. To 
suit the new situation of developing a socialist market economy, 
we should forcefully promote socialist spiritual civilization, 
raise the people's overall educational level, and advance 
development in all social sectors. 
  During his stay in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin also heard reports 
by concerned departments on local economic construction, the 
state of reform and opening up, development in Pudong, 
Shanghai's urban construction, the "vegetable basket" project, 
party building, and the promotion of spiritual civilization. He 
fully affirmed the Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and 
government's achievements in resolutely complying with the 
nation's general work demand for this year and in carrying out 
the principle on economic work which were set forth by the 
central authorities; in properly handling the relationships 
between reform, development, and maintaining stability; and in 
maintaining the good development trend of reform, opening up, 
and economic construction. He said: The party Central Committee 
and State Council's policy on developing and opening up Pudong 
is firmly established and will not change. Developing and 
opening up Pudong not only affects Shanghai's development but 
also is an important symbol of China's reform and opening up. 
The development and opening up of Pudong over the last four 
years has forcefully boosted Shanghai's economic construction 
and has served as a locomotive in developing the economy of the 
entire Chang Jiang Valley. Practice shows that the central 
authorities' decision to develop and open up Pudong is 
completely correct. We must follow Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
instruction that "We should ensure Pudong's development; we must 
not waver and must see to it that the work is completed," and 
ensure that this transcentury great project is properly carried 
out. Jiang Zemin expressed his hope that the comrades in 
Shanghai will persist in emancipating their minds and in seeking 
truth from facts, and, in light of the new situation concerning 
reform, development, and social stability, that they will 
maintain and develop the good situation and do their work in all 
areas even better. 
  Those accompanying General Secretary Jiang Zemin during his 
inspection tour included Zeng Qinghong, director of the General 
Office of the CPC Central Committee.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Foreign direct 
investment continued to increase in this largest economic and 
financial center of Shanghai in the first four months of this 
year following the record year of 1993. 
  According to the latest statistics provided by the municipal 
commission of foreign trade and economic cooperation, Shanghai 
concluded 1,256 agreements on foreign investment projects in the 
first four months of this year, three less than in the same 
period of last year. The projects involved a sum of 2.89 
billion U.S. dollars, up five percent. 
  1993 was a record year for Shanghai when it approved 3,650 
foreign investment projects, involving a total of 7 billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  The fresh wave of foreign direct investment was marked by 
more industrial projects and the involvement of more 
transnational corporations, according to an official from the 
municipal commission of foreign trade and economic cooperation. 
  During this period, the municipality approved 938 industrial 
projects, with a total contractual investment of 1.2 billion 
U.S. dollars, following by property and public utilities 
projects. 
  Of these projects, 16 were financed by 12 transnational 
corporations. This has brought the total number of 
transnational corporations investing in Shanghai up to 130. 
  Hong Kong still remains the biggest source of direct 
investment in Shanghai, with a record 1.88 billion U.S. dollars 
in the first four months of this year. It is followed by the

  [Text] Shanghai, May 9 (XINHUA) -- China's leading 
industrial center has made progress in industrial technology. 
  A municipal official in charge of industry said that 
Shanghai's pillar industries are burgeoning. 
  The city recorded a motor vehicle sales volume of 30.6 
billion yuan-worth last year, and its telecommunications 
services generated 1.667 billion yuan in profits and taxes. 
  Last year Shanghai produced power station equipment 
totalling 
three million kw. 
  While developing new- and high-tech products, enterprises 
speeded up the pace of their technical transformation.

was 73 percent more than in the previous year. 
  The upgraded projects generated an additional of 585 million 
yuan in output value and 100 million yuan in profits and taxes 
and helped save foreign exchange worth 6.65 million U.S. dollars.

  [Excerpts] To implement the guidelines of the central 
rural work conference, take even better charge of spring 
farming, and ensure proper plantation of sufficient early rice, 
the provincial party committee and government held another 
teleconference this afternoon. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Li Zemin delivered an 
important speech at the meeting. He said: The party Central 
Committee recently issued a series of instructions concerning 
the overall situation in safeguarding reform and furthering 
stability. The provincial party committee standing committee and 
secretaries earnestly studied the instructions during their 
administrative meetings. Today's teleconference on early rice 
production is a major step in implementing the party Central 
Committee's instructions. All party committees and governments 
at or above the county level across the province should 
earnestly study General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li 
Peng's important speeches at the central rural work conference 
and, in connection with local realities, put forward ideas for 
implementing their instructions in this year's rural work, which 
includes stabilizing grain production and promoting all-around 
development of the rural economy. 
  At the teleconference, provincial party committee Deputy 
Secretary and Executive Vice Governor Chai Songyue analyzed the 
current situation in preparing for and carrying out spring 
farming across the province, and gave important instructions on 
properly planting sufficient early rice by every possible means 
and on strengthening leadership over early rice production. He 
said: There are three particular problems in the current 
spring-farming preparations and production: 1. There remains a 
certain disparity between grain production and fulfillment of 
the procurement task; 2. the price of goods, materials, and 
electricity for agricultural use have risen too sharply; 3. too 
much land has been requisitioned for development and industrial 
zones which actually make use of only a small portion. There 
are many instances where land is fenced up with no actual 
construction being carried out. [passage omitted] 
  To mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm in grain farming, on 
behalf of the provincial party committee and government Chai 
Songyue reiterated three policies on grain production and 
marketing: 1. To guarantee procurement. Grain departments 
should procure in an open manner all early paddy handed in by 
the peasants regardless of whether or not it is covered by a 
procurement contract and whether or not it is new harvest; that 
is to say, they must not refuse the grain or impose a 
procurement limit. 2. To guarantee preset prices. They should, 
under all circumstances, firmly and fully honor early paddy 
procurement prices and extra-price policy already announced by 
the provincial government. 3. To guarantee the non-issue of IOU 
notes. In procuring grain, grain departments should manage to 
pay cash at the time they procure the grain. It is also 
necessary to ensure the honoring of all supportive policies 
formulated by individual localities. Various localities and 
departments must resolutely implement these policies and should 
never break their promise and hurt the peasants' enthusiasm.

  [Excerpts] The Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee today 
called a meeting to learn from Comrade Liu Lingying. Liu Feng, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party, chaired the meeting, 
at which Deputy Secretary Lu Zhangong of the provincial party 
committee read out a decision by the committee to carry out 
activities in learning from Comrade Liu Lingying. 
  On behalf of the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee, 
Secretary 
of the provincial party committee Li Zemin presented Liu 
Lingying with a horizontal board on which the following words 
are inscribed: Dedicated to her work, selfless and dauntless. 
  In his important speech at the meeting, Comrade Li Zemin 
highly praised Comrade Liu Lingying's deeds, saying: Comrade 
Liu Lingying is an outstanding representative of our province's 
many advanced people and model workers in the new period; a fine 
daughter of the party and people; and an example for the people 
of the province to learn from. 
  Comrade Li Zemin stressed: In learning from Comrade Liu 
Lingying's advanced deeds and ideas, first, we should learn from 
her in putting the interests of the state and people above 
everything else, and in creating an atmosphere in which everyone 
should subordinates their own interests to those of the whole 
and protect and contribute to the latter. Second, we should 
learn from her in being highly responsible for her work, being 
willing to work at an ordinary post, being selfless and 
dedicated to her work, being cautious and conscientious, and 
working hard in a down-to-earth manner. Third, we should learn 
from Comrade Liu in having firm faith in socialism and a lofty 
outlook on life. Fourth, we should learn from Comrade Liu 
Lingying in being ready to take up the cudgel for a just cause, 
being selfless and dauntless, and daring to firmly fight against 
a criminal. Fifth, we should learn from Comrade Liu Lingying in 
always upholding principles, handling matters impartially, being 
content with a plain or even poor life, being scrupulous in 
separating public from private interest, and never abusing her 
power to seek personal gain. Her ideas, values, moral 
character, and work style are good, indeed. [passage omitted] 
  Prior to the meeting, Li Zemin, Liu Feng, Chai Songyue, Lu 
Zhangong, Liang Pingbo, Chen Yuexing, and other leaders of the 
provincial party and government organizations met cordially with 
Liu Lingying and her husband. They also asked with concern 
about her recovery and living conditions. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Macao, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The economic and trade 
cooperation between Guangdong Province, south China, and Macao 
has developed smoothly and steadily in tandem with the rapid 
economic development in the two places in recent years. 
  Guangdong, one of the economic giants of China, has reported 
year-on-year increase in absorbing foreign investments, which 
reached 9.65 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, with a large part 
coming from Hong Kong and Macao. 
  Statistics show that Macao's investment in China's mainland 
totalled 4.3 billion U.S. dollars and Macao-funded enterprises 
reached 2,300, most of them are located in Guangdong Province, 
especially the Pearl River Delta area. 
  As of the first quarter of 1994, Macao businessmen have set 
up more than 780 joint or solely-funded firms in the neighboring 
Zhuhai special economic zone. These firms are mainly involved 
in textile, electronics, medicines, food production, 
cloth-making and real estate industry. 
  Meanwhile, there are also a great number of enterprises from 
Guangdong which have invested in Macao to set up enterprises, 
contract projects, run real estate or export and import 
businesses. Their total investment in Macao stands at about 1.5 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  Moreover, trade between Macao and Guangdong has also 
developed rapidly in recent years. In 1982, some 40 percent of 
Macao's exports to China's mainland went to Guangdong Province, 
while the figure increased to 80 percent in 1992. Additionally, 
some 40 percent of Macao's imports from China's mainland came 
from Guangdong.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 8 (XINHUA) -- South China's Guangdong 
Province recently passed a new forest law, which is to come into 
effect soon. 
  The forest protection and management regulations, a revision 
of 1987 regulations, divides Guangdong's forests into ecological 
and public forests and commercial forests, to which different 
rules will apply. 
  The ecological and public forests include those for wind 
shelter, water and soil conservation, recreation and 
sightseeing, and protection of plants and animals. 
  This area of forest land must account for no less than 30 
percent of the total forest area and will be maintained under 
the government budget. It will be free from commercial felling, 
the new law reads. 
  Forest resources, including timber, fuel and economic 
forests, fall under the category of commercial forests. 
  According to the new regulations, the felling of commercial 
trees will be controlled by quotas and a licensing system. 
Commercial forests could be subject to rent, transfer and 
mortgage. 
  The new law encourages the development of forests through 
means other than governmental investment, such as the use of 
overseas funds or stock companies. 
  The publishing of the new law was preceded by the province's 
announcement last year that its forest coverage had reached 53.7 
percent. 
  Forest officials said the new law is aimed at consolidating 
and expanding the province's achievement in afforestation, and 
establishing a new forest management system that fits with a 
market economy. 
  The new law stipulates that the province will keep its 
forest 
coverage above 50 percent and that all cities and towns allow 
for 30 percent of urban areas to remain green land. 
  The new law also contains detailed articles on punishment 
for 
offenses.

  [Text] Shenzhen, China's most economically dynamic city, 
has vowed to tighten ideological control in its bold drive to 
catch up with the "little dragons" in the regions. Plans for 
the strengthening of ideological work were laid down by its 
municipal Communist Party Secretary Li Youwei in a speech 
delivered at a municipal work conference last week. 
  According to his speech published by Shenzhen's official 
media, Mr. Li said ideological work in the border city could 
only be boosted -- not weakened -- in the course of seeking 
economic prosperity. He hinted that the closeness of Shenzhen 
to Hong Kong made it more vulnerable to bad influences. 
  "We should have a sober mind to see that thoughts of 
money-worshipping, hedonism and extreme individualism have been 
prevalent among some people," said Mr. Li. This, he said, had 
given rise to malpractices including trading power for gains. 
  He pointed to the grassroots sector of villages and 
townships, where political indoctrination was weak and lax. 
  Mr. Li also accused some cadres of paying lip-service to 
ideological work, and others of downgrading its significance. 
"We must grasp with both hands our economic construction and 
ideological work," he said. 
  Mr. Li called on party cells at all levels to take the lead 
in learning Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on socialism. They should 
take forceful measures to enhance the ideological education and 
quality of the 93,000-strong party members in the city he said 
in a Shenzhen Special Zone Daily report. 
  Government cadres above the division level should return to 
party school in the next two years to be educated on the 
socialist dogmas, said Mr. Li. He singled out management cadres 
in enterprises as important targets. 
  "They should consciously resist the infiltration of thoughts 
of 'money goes first' and decadent lifestyles....They should 
handle well the proper relationship between public interest and 
individual interest," he said. 
  Mr. Li urged cadres to widen their prospective and abandoned 
outdated thoughts. He admitted reforms had hit a snag where 
cadres considered their own interests first, and warned this 
would "obstruct or delay" reform. 
  Mr. Li said propaganda officials should constantly spot 
problems facing the people and take prompt measures to deal with 
disputes.

  [Text] Tarnished by planning chaos, Shenzhen has vowed to 
improve long-term city planning and turn the border city into a 
regional "cosmopolis". Shenzhen's Communist Party chief, Li 
Youwei said planning should have the aim of turning the city 
into a metropolis. "We have to take into account the 
convergence of the city with the neighbouring regions," he said. 
He was addressing a municipal conference on city planning and 
management last week. 
  Mr Li said the Shenzhen planned to increase ties with Hong 
Kong to help elevate it into another "little dragon" in the 
Asia-Pacific region. However, the lack of planning and 
supervision over city management in the 16-year-old Special 
Economic Zone had resulted in chronic problems such as 
industrial hazards and backward infrastructure facilities. 
According to the SHENZHEN SPECIAL ZONE DAILY, Mr Li urged 
municipal officials to try to "converge with Hong Kong and adopt 
international practices" when mapping out the city plans and 
management regulations. He said: "We should establish a new 
city concept under which the economies of Shenzhen and Hong Kong 
will be integrated." Mr Li, also the municipal Mayor, said the 
Special Economic Zone should be integrated also with the Pearl 
River Delta region. He called for innovative thought in 
planning developments, and successful experience to be borrowed 
from the mainland and abroad. 
  Mr Li said the "authority" of city planning should be 
upheld, 
saying the city would oppose sternly any "anarchism and 
separatism" and violations of laws. Any violators of laws must 
be severely dealt with, he said. To strengthen leadership in 
city planning, regulations should establish the task of 
planning, construction and supervision in development. 
  Vice-mayor Li Chuan-fang called for infrastructure planning 
and relevant reforms to be speeded up to help the social and 
economic development of the country. He said also municipal 
authorities would clamp down on malpractice such as unlawful 
occupation of land and change of land use. 
  According to the China News Service, the Shenzhen 
authorities 
will adopt a series of measures to improve traffic problems. 
Traffic lights at 118 road junctions will be automated and 
traffic flow at major roads and the first and second borders of 
the city will be monitored by closed-circuit television, the 
report said. New buildings must have their own car parks, and 
vehicle buyers will be required to produce proof of purchase of 
a parking lot. Vehicles from outside the city which will be 
used in the region for more than three months will have to be 
licensed. Mini-bus numbers will be curbed, and mass-transport 
facilities, such as buses, will be given priority on roads, it 
said.

  [Text] Wuhan, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The Hubei Provincial 
Government has decided to do everything within its power to 
assist the Dongfeng Automobile Company in becoming an auto giant 
capable of building one million units annually. 
  The company, based in Shiyan in northwestern Hubei, is one 
of 
the three car manufacturers designated by the Chinese Government. 
  A provincial government official said that the company plans 
to build 800,600 motor vehicles a year by the year 2000, 
including 360,000 passenger cars. 
  Its annual production will rise to 1.16 million units by 
2005, including 620,000 cars, the official said. 
  He said he believed that the implementation of the company's 
development plan would enable Hubei's economy to take off. 
  A committee for invigorating Hubei's automobile industry has 
been set up, with provincial Governor Jia Zhijie serving as its 
head, he said. 
  It will mobilize local governments and departments to aid 
the 
company in carrying out its development plan. 
  To this end, the provincial planning commission has decided 
to gear the company's production plan with the plan for the 
growth of Hubei's economy as a whole, he said. 
  Relevant provincial departments have been requested to 
include production of metals, machinery, electronic products, 
rubber, engineering plastics, textiles, glass and other 
auto-related goods into their long-term production plans, he 
added. 
  In addition, provincial departments in charge of 
environmental protection, taxation, land administration, urban 
construction and transportation have been mandated to formulate 
preferential policies in support of the company in implementing 
its production plan. 
  Local manufacturers are being encouraged to co-operate with 
the company, he said, adding that the company can become a 
principal shareholder in these manufacturers. 
  To meet its production target for the year 2000 the company 
will require 34 billion yuan in investment, the official said. 
  The provincial financial department has decided to allocate 
one billion yuan in bank loans annually over the next five years 
to help local manufacturers modernize the production of auto 
parts and accessories, he said, adding that banks will increase 
loans to the company. 
  Moreover, businesses manufacturing auto parts for the 
company 
will issue shares in China in a move to raise money, he said. 
  Economists in Hubei agreed that government backing is 
essential for the takeoff of the automobile industry, as shown 
in Germany, Japan and the Republic of Korea. 
  Hubei has good conditions for expanding the auto industry, 
with a whole range of well-developed related industries, such as 
metallurgy, chemicals, rubber, plastics and electric power, one 
economist noted.
