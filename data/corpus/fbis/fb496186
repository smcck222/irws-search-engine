  [Text] Lhasa, May 7 (XINHUA) -- The Standing Committee of 
China's Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress adopted 
today "The Rules on Administration of Foreigners' Mountaineering 
in Tibet," which will go into effect as of July 1, this year. 
  The rules are the first of its kind drawn up by the people's

  Tibet is rich in mountaineering resources. Among the 14 
mountain peaks with an elevation of more than 8,000 meters in 
the world, four are located at the border of Tibet region and 
Nepal and one is within Tibet. Besides, there are thousands of 
peaks over 7,000 meters above the sea level. 
  Since 1980, Tibet has opened 44 mountain peaks to foreigners 
and received nearly 6,000 mountaineers from 26 countries and 
regions. 
  All those who come for mountain-climbing, expedition, 
skiing, 
gliding or rock-climbing at a mountain peak over 5,500 meters 
above the sea level in Tibet or at the border of Tibet should 
abide by the rules. 
  According to the rules, any foreigner going to mountaineer 
in 
Tibet should present an written application to Tibet 
Mountaineering Association for approval. Besides, foreign 
mountaineering groups or individuals going to mountaineer in 
Tibet should apply for the entrance of their means of 
communications, telecommunication and photographical equipment

Yesterday Held Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony; Regional Leaders Basang, 
Danzim, Lieque, Puqung, Laba Pingcuo, and Ga Gin, Deputy 
Political Commissar of the Tibet Regional People's Armed Police 
Corps; and Wang Yuchuan, Vice Chairman of the Beida and 
Fangzheng Groups, Attended"] 
  [Text] Amid crackling firecrackers, Basang, deputy 
chairman of the Xizang Regional Party Committee and vice 
chairman of the regional committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference; Laba Pingcuo, vice chairman 
of the regional people's government; and Wang Yuchuan, vice 
chairman of the Bada and Fangzheng Groups and general manager of 
the Chengdu Fangzheng Corp. Ltd., took up their scissors. Soon, 
three red flowers dropped onto a platter. After 38 years of 
unremitting efforts, XIZANG RIBAO, while marking its founding 
anniversary on 22 April, also said goodbye to its "lead and 
fire" history and ushered in a "light and electricity" era. 
From now on, both the Chinese and Tibetan editions of the 
XIZANG RIBAO will be typeset by laser, and the paper, like all 
other provincial-level papers in the country, has upgraded its 
typesetting with new technology. 
  Danzim, a veteran XIZANG RIBAO newsman and deputy secretary 
of the regional party committee, expressed what was in the 
hearts of the entire XIZANG RIBAO staff. He said: "With the 
use of laser typesetting technology, the long-cherished dream of 
veteran newsmen has been realized, and the frontier areas' 
journalistic development has made one step forward." 
Representing the regional party committee and the regional 
people's government, Danzim warmly congratulated the entire 
XIZANG RIBAO staff and thanked the Beida and Fangzheng Groups 
for their unselfish assistance and energetic support. 
  Lie Que, member of the regional party committee standing 
committee and secretary of the Lhasa Municipal Party Committee; 
Pucung, vice chairman of the regional people's congress standing 
committee; and Ga Jin, deputy political commissar of the Tibet 
Regional People's Armed Police Corps; as well as persons in 
charge of relevant departments, bureaus, committees, and offices 
in Tibet, leaders in charge of propaganda in various 
prefectures; and journalists of various news units in Lhasa, 
also came to XIZANG RIBAO to extend their congratulations. 
  Gao Yanxiang, XIZANG RIBAO editor-in-chief, said excitedly: 
Although XIZANG RIBAO is the last newspaper in the country to 
begin using laser typesetting technology, the use of this 
technology has great significance. It represents a leap forward 
and a revolution in Tibet's newspaper publishing history. He 
added: The regional party committee and government set strict 
requirements for the laser typesetting project and always 
expressed interests in its progress. Despite financial 
restraints, planning, financial, banking, designing, and 
construction departments made sure that special funds for the 
project were available and the project was meticulously designed 
and installed. Postal, telecommunications, and power 
departments made positive efforts in coordinating our paper's 
normal publishing and distribution; civil air transport and the 
Lhasa Air Command [kong zhi 4500 2172] airlifted the machinery 
to Lhasa safely and in the quickest way possible; and newspapers 
and publishing units of central authorities and all provinces 
and municipalities gave us their warm encouragement and support. 
All this reflected the great importance which people of all 
walks of life inside and outside Tibet attached to XIZANG 
RIBAO's news reporting and propaganda; reflected the spirit of 
unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance; and reflected the 
warmth of our Motherland as a big family and the fraternal ties 
among people of all nationalities. Speaking on behalf of the 
entire XIZANG RIBAO staff, Gao Yanxiang pledged that the entire 
XIZANG RIBAO staff would continue to carry forward the spirit of 
waging arduous struggle, being ready to dedicate themselves, and 
working hard in unity in operating the newspaper. He said the 
XIZANG RIBAO staff will continue to emancipate their minds, 
press forward, and bring forth new ideas to create a good and 
stable environment for Xizang's spiritual and material 
construction. 
  At yesterday's ribbon-cutting ceremony, Du Tai, deputy head 
of the regional party committee propaganda department; and Wang 
Yuchuan, vice chairman of the Beida and Fangzheng Groups and 
president of the Chengdu Fangzheng Electronics Corp. Ltd., also 
gave warm speeches. 
  Following the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the leaders and 
visitors toured the laser typesetting room with great interest.

  [Text] The Tibet Autonomous Region has achieved results in 
reforming its cultural system, resulting in increased cultural 
and art activities. In the past few years, Tibet's literary and 
art workers have stressed the importance of the people's 
cultural life. Last year, despite a shortage of funds, Tibet 
built six county cultural halls, outlined the "Dandelion Plan," 
formed a regional cultural and art committee for young children, 
and actively conducted training for budding talents in 
literature and art. 
  The autonomous region reformed the movie-screening system, 
consolidated movie-screening teams in rural and pastoral 
regions, and screened 100 films on patriotism in the entire 
region. 
  After a year's work, Tibet made further progress in its 
concept of the reform of the cultural system. Last year, 
various professional art groups produced 98 scripts and held 435 
performances which a total of 350,000 people attended.

  [Excerpts] The enlarged standing committee meeting of the 
Liaoning Provincial Party Committee was held in Shenyang on 7 
May. Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
first reported on the changes of principal leaders of the 
provincial government. Yue Qifeng, former deputy secretary of 
the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee and vice governor of 
Liaoning Province and currently secretary of the Heilongjiang 
Provincial Party Committee, made an impromptu speech. 
  At the meeting, Wen Shizhen, deputy secretary of the 
Liaoning 
Provincial Party Committee and vice governor of the province, 
made an overall arrangement for the current economic work. He 
said: At the moment, we should pay attention to the following 
tasks: First, the entire society should show concern and all 
the people in the province should participate in the endeavor of 
invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. 
The present situation in the province's large and medium-sized 
enterprises is grim. The task in the second quarter is to 
reverse the situation of suffering losses. The range of 
deficits in the second quarter should be reduced to 14 percent. 
The provincial government will adopt measures to help 
enterprises reverse their deficits and resolve major problems 
that hamper industrial production. [passage indistinct] 
Second, we should pay attention to agriculture in an effort to 
promote the all-around development of the rural economy. At 
present, we should ensure the fulfillment of two objectives: to 
keep grain output at (?15 million) tonnes or more and to keep 
the per capita income at about 1,300 yuan. [passage omitted] 
  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
stressed three tasks at the meeting. He said: First, we should 
change ideas and deepen reform. Specifically speaking, we 
should appropriately handle the relations in five aspects, 
namely, the relations between cities and the countryside, the 
relations between industry and agriculture, the relations 
between large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and 
township and town enterprises, the relations between the 
state-owned economy and the non-state-owned economy, and the 
relations between high and new technology and traditional 
industries. Second, we should seek unity of understanding, 
strengthen leadership, and make concerted efforts to safeguard 
social order. Third, we should pay attention to party building, 
oppose corruption and encourage integrity and honesty, and 
change the style of work.

  [Text] During his recent inspection of some mountainous 
areas in southern Gansu, provincial party committee Secretary 
Yan Haiwang conducted on-site investigations and study. He 
stated emphatically: We should make every possible endeavor to 
steadily develop agriculture, successfully build 
vegetable-basket projects, and show more concern for people's 
livelihood. 
  From 20 April to 25 April, Secretary Yan Haiwang and his 
entourage went deep into seven counties in southern Gansu to 
inspect town and township enterprises and vegetable production 
bases. They also visited some peasant households; inquired 
about the situation in the implementation of central policies, 
the building of vegetable-basket projects, and arrangements for 
people's livelihood; and helped local areas tackle economic 
problems. 
  After being briefed on the situation in building 
vegetable-basket projects in these counties, Secretary Yan 
Haiwang noted that the supply and prices of vegetables now have 
become a pressing issue for urban residents. This is why 
vegetable-basket projects have a crucial bearing on the overall 
situation. 
  During his investigations and study, Secretary Yan Haiwang 
fully affirmed the achievements scored in economic development 
by the seven counties, saying: Now that the seven counties have 
made excellent development plans, they should strive to 
implement their respective plans to the letter in the months 
ahead, make redoubled efforts to emancipate their minds, push 
ahead with opening up and exploitation, become bold in trying 
out new methods, firmly implement new methods proven successful 
in practice, vigorously further reforms, develop a series of new 
trains of thought to guide local economic development, carry 
forward a self-reliance spirit, and work in a down-to-earth 
manner. 
  Secretary Yan Haiwang also called for making sound 
arrangements for people's livelihood and for solving the problem 
of sufficient food for poor peasant households in the province's 
mountainous and disaster areas, in batches and stages. He urged 
leaders at all levels across the province, and especially 
principal leaders, to attach great importance to and assume 
personal responsibility for work in this regard. 
  Those accompanying Secretary Yan Haiwang during his recent 
investigations and study were Song Zhaosu, secretary general and 
member of the provincial party committee standing committee; Mu 
Wenli, member of the provincial party committee standing 
committee and secretary of the Zhangye City CPC Committee; Han 
Zhengfu, vice chairman of the provincial committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; as well as 
some other provincial leaders.

  [Text] From 27 to 29 April, Liu Ronghui, deputy secretary 
of the provincial party committee, went to a series of rural 
areas and factories in Anzhai and Xian, and in the (Yancheng) 
oil deposit administration to conduct investigations and study. 
On the afternoon of 29 April, after hearing the report 
submitted by the Yanan Prefectural CPC Committee and 
administrative office, Liu Ronghui said: The ongoing fiscal and 
tax reform touches on a wide range of endeavors. We should 
strive to meet the requirements of the reform, seek new tax 
funds in line with the new requirements, and properly handle the 
relationship between the state, the local enterprises, and the 
individuals, with the stress on the active disposition of new 
tax funds. State income tax comes mainly from state-owned and 
individual enterprises. We should pay close attention to the 
collection of the business tax from tertiary industrial 
undertakings and [words indistinct] tax. We should approach tax 
collection from a strategic prospective. We should carry out 
tax collection work efficiently and at an early date, otherwise 
we will fall behind and suffer great losses. In this regard, we 
should place great stress on the smooth transition of the new 
taxation system and should institute and improve tax collection 
work at the departmental level as soon as possible. On one 
hand, we should upgrade and readjust tax collection and 
management, and on the other hand, [words indistinct]. 
  When discussing Yanan's oil exploitation, Liu Ronghui said: 
One should not think that one will make a name for himself as 
long as he has resources or the one will have nothing to do as 
long as the state takes care of his resources. Both unrealistic 
optimism and pessimism are wrong. We should take the road of 
developing the oil industry by exploiting oil through reliance 
on the policy set by the provincial authorities. In light of 
Yanan's actual conditions, we should consider the development 
orientation of oil from the angle of the market economy, promote 
the transformation from commodity type to commodity-operation 
type and from fuel type to fuel [words indistinct] type. In 
refining, we should coordinate with colleges and universities, 
large enterprises, and scientific research institutes. 
  As for the issue of coal, when put on the market, coal 
should 
be priced appropriately. If we set too high a price, we will be 
unable to sell it, but if we set too low a price for coal, we 
will suffer losses in operation. We should energetically 
develop a diversified economy and [words indistinct].

  [Text] On 14 April, Kashi Prefecture cracked down on a 
number of criminals, thus contributing to efforts to maintain 
social order and to deter lawless elements. 
  In view of the fact that the felony crime rate has been on 
the rise in the last few years, courts at all levels of Kashi 
Prefecture have been resolute and have shown no mercy in 
clamping down on crime. On 14 April, a total of 47 criminals 
involved in 34 cases that have taken place since 1993 were 
sentenced in Kashi city, Shufu County, Jiashi County, Markit 
County, Shache County, and Yecheng County. Eleven criminals, 
including Abudu Kelimu, Abuli Miti, and Aishan Tuoxun, were 
executed for intended manslaughter or for robbing taxis, acts 
which had a very bad social influence. Another 36 criminals 
were sentenced to various prison terms of at least one year for 
rape, stealing, swindling, intentionally causing injuries to 
others, kidnapping, or illegally detaining other persons.

  [Text] Urumqi, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang 
Uygur Autonomous Region has built 14 quality cotton production 
bases in a bid to boost its cotton industry. 
  According to local officials, the bases, which are scattered 
across both sides of the Tianshan Mountains, have a total cotton 
growing area of 200,000 ha, accounting for one third of the 
autonomous region's total cotton growing acreage. 
  The production capacity of the bases has been greatly 
enhanced thanks to the establishment of comprehensive services 
concerning operation and management, technology application, the 
breeding of good strains, purchase and processing, coupled with 
increased investment from the central government. 
  Last year Xinjiang earned 7.2 billion yuan from sales of 
commodity cotton, accounting for more than half of the earnings 
from the marketing of produce from the region's farming sector. 
  Local farmers also netted an increase of 80 yuan in their 
per 
capita income from the growing of cotton alone. 
  The officials said that this year the growing area of cotton 
in Xinjiang is expected to surpass 733,333 ha, compared to 
644,666 ha in 1993. 
  They pledged to redouble their efforts to boost cotton 
production and make the region's total output of cotton reach 
one million tons by 1996.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 8 (XINHUA) -- Hsu Hui-yu, deputy 
secretary-general of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF), and his party arrived in Hangzhou, capital of 
Zhejiang Province, this afternoon. 
  At the invitation of the mainland's Association for 
Relations 
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), Hsu and his party, including 
some experts, have come to Zhejiang to inquire into the Qiandao 
Lake incident. They were met by ARATS officials at the airport. 
  The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Chunan 
County 
on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat and the 
robbery and murder of 32 tourists from Taiwan and the mainland. 
Of the dead, 24 were from Taiwan. 
  The 21-member SEF party has nine SEF officials, six experts, 
five relatives of the victims and one travel agency official. 
  Li Yafei, deputy secretary-general of ARATS, will preside 
over a meeting to invite mainland inspectors handling the case 
to inform the SEF party of the case. 
  Arrangements will be made for the SEF party to join an 
investigation tour on Qiandao Lake and visit relatives of 
mainland victims of the crime. 
  The appropriate departments of Zhejiang Province will also 
listen to comments from relatives of the Taiwan victims. 
  At the airport, Hsu Hui-yu stressed that the purpose of his 
party's trip to Zhejiang is to learn about the progress of the 
mainland's handling of the case. 
  He said, "We will raise our questions from an objective, 
rational and professional angle." 
  He said that the tragedy shocked the people across the 
straits and only by healing the wound promptly can the relations 
across the straits be promoted. 
  The SEF party will leave Hangzhou for Taiwan on May 14.

  [Text] A 21-member delegation of the Strait Exchange 
Foundation [SEF] of Taiwan, led by its head, Xu Huiyou [Hsu 
Hui-yu], arrived in Hangzhou by a Dongfang Airlines flight from 
Hong Kong this afternoon. They will hear a report by experts of 
Zhejiang's relevant departments in connection with the Qiandao 
tourist boat incident and will make an on-the-spot survey of the 
incident to collect evidence. 
  (Qiao Feng), vice chairman of the mainland's Secretariat of 
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]; 
(Zhou Ming), deputy director of ARATS' Administrative 
Department; and (Qiu Mingfa), deputy director of Zhejiang's 
Taiwan Affairs Office, greeted the delegation at the airport. 
  At the airport, when interviewed by a reporter, delegation 
head Xu Huiyou admitted that up to now the Taiwan side has 
possessed only fragmentary knowledge of the Qiandao Lake 
incident. Therefore, he said it is hoped that the Taiwan side 
will gain a comprehensive understanding of the case through an 
on-the-spot investigation.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Leaders Vow To Tighten Airline Security"] </F>
  [Text] Aviation leaders have vowed to tighten airline 
security and prevent hijackings by urging staff to take all 
possible safety measures. 
  "It is a must to strictly enforce rules for air 
security--from ticket sales, passenger and luggage check-in, 
boarding, on-board inspection--to deal with air piracy," said 
Chen Guangyi, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China 
(CAAC). 
  CAAC will resolutely probe hijacking cases, punish those 
responsible and take swift counter-measures. Chen told a 
conference in Fuzhou, provincial capital of Fujian. 
  The city sits directly across the straits from Taiwan, where 
many hijackers have attempted to force planes to land. 
  Chen also expressed hope that Taiwan authorities would 
co-operate with the mainland to crack down on air piracy. 
  "We are awaiting a treaty between the mainland's Association 
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and the Taiwan's Straits 
Exchanges Foundation on repatriation of hijackers" he said. 
  "Once both sides can join hands in the war against air 
piracy 
and force hijackers back to where they flew from, we can root 
out these crimes for the safety of the travelling public." 
  CAAC's anti-hijacking campaign had a direct impact last year 
when officials issued a series of rules on tightening air 
defence, expanded air security employment and installed more 
safety check devices. 
  Security departments foiled six hijacking attempts, detected 
45 suspects with concealed firearms or knives, and confiscated 
contraband and other dangerous articles. 
  In a letter to the meeting, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua 
cautioned 
that air security should do its utmost to prevent hijackings.

<F P=106> ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Maintain a </F>
Consensus, Push Forward the Development of Cross-Strait 
Relations"] 
  [Text] My brothers, 
  The fourth round of working talks between the Association 
for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] and the Straits 
Exchange Foundation [SEF] is to be held in Beijing late this 
month. Much attention has been given to the talks on both sides 
of the Taiwan Straits, because the goal is to reach a mutually 
agreed- upon draft agreement, based on the consensus reached in 
Beijing early last month between the persons-in-charge of ARATS 
and SEF. These talks will play an important role of continuing 
the process already begun and paving the way for future 
development in pushing forward the growth of cross-strait ties. 
  Whether the task shouldered by the fourth round of working 
talks can be smoothly carried out or not depends on the joint 
efforts of both sides. What is pleasant and encouraging is that 
both sides have given very high credence to the consensus 
reached in the Tang [Shubei]-Chiao [Jen-ho] talks in Beijing in 
early February, and both have taken an active and optimistic 
attitude towards translating such views into an agreed-upon 
text. Tang Shubei, executive vice chairman of ARATS, observed 
that in the February talks between Mr. Chiao Jen-ho and himself, 
three issues existing in the working talks had been settled in 
terms of overall direction, and the wording of a document had 
been informally put forward by both sides. Both sides have the 
willingness and confidence to fix, in the fourth talks, a draft 
agreement on the three issues. Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the 
board of SEF, commented that it was not easy to gain in five 
days the achievements of the third round of talks held in early 
February, proving the influence and importance of high-level 
dialogue. Chiao Jen-ho, vice-chairman and secretary general of 
SEF, hoped that the results of his talks with Tang Shubei would 
cause a consensus to be reached as swiftly as possible in the 
fourth round of working talks so that final preparation for 
signing an agreement could be completed. 
  Admittedly, there will be difficulties in translating the 
consensus achieved into the concrete articles of the agreement, 
and disagreements do need to be overcome. However, with the 
consensus reached last time as the basis, it is presumed those 
problems will not be difficult to resolve. What needs to be 
mentioned in particular is that the first point of the 5-point 
consensus expressed in the joint press release is: "Both sides 
hold that in the working talks between ARATS and SEF, political 
issues should be avoided with an attitude of pragmatism." It is 
an important sign that progress has been made in the working 
talks between the two associations. People believe that as long 
as both sides make joint efforts and maintain and keep to the 
consensus, instead of damaging and diverging from the consensus, 
they will be able to overcome disagreements and finalize the 
drafting of the agreement articles. 
  In the first point of the five-point consensus of the joint 
press release of the Tang-Chiao talks, it was stipulated that in 
the fourth round of working talks -- to be held in late March -- 
opinions would be exchanged or discussions conducted on several 
economic and scientific and technological issues cited in the 
"Joint Agreement of the Wang-Koo Talks". An important 
achievement of the Wang-Koo talks was that economic, scientific, 
and technological topics should be included on the agenda of the 
cross-strait working talks as soon as possible. Only because of 
the Taiwan side was that important topic not fixed until the 
February Tang-Chiao talks as one of the contents of the next 
talks. Although the wording in this paragraph was determined 
through modification just before the release of news of the 
talks and therefore economic, scientific, and technological 
topics were not formally included on the agenda, it does show, 
all the same, that both sides have reached a certain degree of 
consensus on this issue. 
  As a matter of fact, it is in the interest of the people on 
both sides to strengthen cross-strait economic and trade 
exchange and cooperation, whether in terms of the current 
realities of the relationship between the two sides of the 
Taiwan Straits, or in terms of looking into the vast prospects 
of cross-strait economic and trade cooperation. In this 
respect, we should not avoid general problems that await both 
sides to settle through discussion and coordination, nor is it 
proper to procrastinate. As authorized nongovernmental bodies, 
ARATS and SEF should shoulder the task of promoting economic and 
scientific and technological exchange and cooperation between 
the two sides. 
  At this moment, it is very difficult to soften and 
eliminate, 
in a short period of time, political disagreements formed 
because of the long-time estrangement between the two sides of 
the Taiwan Straits. Yet complementary and mutually beneficial 
economic and trade exchange and cooperation between the two 
sides can build closer cross-strait relations. The progress in 
cross-strait relations in recent years demonstrates that among 
nongovernmental contacts and exchanges between the two sides, 
the most dynamic factor is economic and trade cooperation and 
exchange, which not only plays a positive role in promoting the 
economic prosperity of the two sides, but also promotes the 
healthy, mutually driving development of cross-strait relations. 
It can be said that, with the two sides having more common 
economic interests, it will be beneficial in greatly increasing 
the mutual trust and consensus between both sides. 
  The mainland side has made unceasing efforts to promote 
economic and trade exchange and cooperation between the two 
sides of the straits. Not long ago, the Law of the People's 
Republic of China on Protecting the Investments of Taiwan 
Compatriots was examined and approved during the Sixth Session 
of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's 
Congress. The law provides the highest level and fullest legal 
protection of investments in the mainland by Taiwan compatriots. 
Its promulgation and execution will certainly promote 
cross-strait economic and trade exchange and cooperation. 
Meanwhile, it will create the favorable conditions for ARATS and 
SEF to jointly discuss topics on cross-strait economic 
cooperation. 
  May the fourth round of working talks between ARATS and SEF 
be a complete success! 
  Sincerely, 
  [Signed] Bao Xin 
  [Dated] 13 March

  [Text] Taipei, May 7 (CNA) -- Beijing has agreed to allow 
40 Taiwan reporters to visit Mainland China to cover an 
investigation into the March 31 murder and robbery of 24 Taiwan 
tourists on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province. 
  "We were told that two or three more applications could be 
available if needed," Li Ching-ping, deputy secretary-general of 
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), told newsmen Saturday [7 
May] morning. 
  Li said he received a phone call from Liu Gangqi, deputy 
secretary-general of the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), saying Beijing has approved the entry of 
40 Taiwan reporters, up from the previous quota of 30. 
  SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations authorized by 
the two sides to handle private exchanges in the absence of 
official contacts. 
  Liu was quoted as saying that the mainland authorities are 
limiting the number of reporters because of transportation 
difficulties. 
  The increase in the number of reporters has been perceived 
as 
a concession by Beijing to improve its image following a protest 
by Taipei on Friday. 
  Mainland security authorities have accused three suspects of 
arson, robbery and murder in the March 31 crime and arrested a 
fourth suspect. 
  Meanwhile, H.Y. Hsu, SEF deputy secretary-general, is 
scheduled to lead a 22-member delegation to Hangzhou on Sunday. 
The group will comprise the victims' relatives, forensic 
experts, and SEF staffers.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, May 6 (CNA) -- Taiwan on Friday [6 May] 
protested to Mainland China over its restriction on the number 
of Taiwan reporters that will be allowed by Beijing to cover the 
trial of the four men charged with robbing and killing 24 Taiwan 
tourists and eight mainland guides and crew members on Qiandao 
Lake. 
  "It simply doesn't make any sense to impose such 
restrictions," Yeh Chin-feng, vice chairwoman of the Mainland 
Affairs Council, said one day after mainland authorities made 
the decision to allow only 30 Taiwan journalists to cover the 
case. 
  The four men charged in the crime -- three for murder, 
arson, 
and robbery and one for complicity -- will stand trial on 
Tuesday. 
  Li Ching-ping, deputy secretary-general of the Straits 
Exchange Foundation, said SEF had conveyed a complaint to its 
mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Straits (ARATS). 
  SEF and ARATS are semi-official organizations authorized by 
the two sides to handle private exchanges in the absence of 
official contacts. 
  In the complaint, Li pointed out, SEF said it could not 
figure out why the mainland wants to restrict the number of 
Taiwan journalists when it had previously indicated Taiwan 
journalists would be freely allowed to cover the case. 
  "That abrupt change has caused extreme discontent among the 
local mass media," Li said. SEF Deputy Secretary General H. Y. 
Hsu is scheduled to lead a 22-member delegation to Mainland 
China on Sunday to look into the mainland's investigation into 
the incident. The group will comprise relatives of the victims, 
lawyers and forensic experts. 
  Hsu also called on the mainland to re-think its restrictions 
on news coverage, saying that only by clarifying the lingering 
doubts surrounding the deaths can fragile cross-strait ties be 
patched up. 
  Beijing at first insisted that the tourists were killed in 
an 
accident, and refused to allow the victims' relatives to board 
the pleasure boat on which the tourists perished. Taiwan 
reporters were also barred from the scene. 
  Mainland authorities did an about-face on the issue, 
however, 
after Taiwan threatened to put a stop to private exchanges 
between the two sides, which began in 1989. Beijing's handling 
of the case touched off an uproar here, and led President Li 
Teng-hui, in an unusually strongly worded statement, to call the 
Beijing regime a group of "bandits," who should have been 
overthrown by the people a long time ago.

  [Text] To speed up our country's entry into GATT, a senior 
Council of Agriculture official disclosed yesterday [6 May]: 
Our country may offer a concrete response at the Sino-U.S. 
consultations scheduled for 12 May on lifting controls on 21 
sensitive agricultural products, including chicken, chopped 
cooked animal entrails, red beans, and peanuts. Moreover, our 
country does not exclude the possibility of promising to further 
adjust the size of tariff reductions, with which the U.S. side 
is dissatisfied. 
  Our country's delegation to GATT consultations will leave by 
plane for the United States next Tuesday [10 May] to begin the 
second round of bilateral GATT consultations with the U.S. side. 
Meanwhile, the Board of Foreign Trade has completed the plan for 
categorizing import goods, which will go into effect on 1 July. 
On that day, 92 percent of the goods on our country's import 
categorization list will be allowed into the country without 
licenses, bringing to 2 percent the proportion of goods subject 
to import restrictions. By taking this action, Taiwan will 
truly move toward export and import liberalization.

  [Text] Taipei, May 7 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
and the United States will hold another round of tariff talks 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
framework in Washington, D.C., next week. 
  "The coming negotiations are expected to focus on more than 
1,200 agricultural products," said Chen Wu-hsiung, director of 
economics and planning development for the Council of 
Agriculture's [as received]. Chen added that the talks may also 
cover non- agriculture products. 
  Chen, who will participate in the talks slated to begin May 
12, said Taiwan will make some concessions in the consultations, 
but he declined to elaborate. The ROC delegation will be led by 
Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng. 
  The US is expected to ask Taiwan to lift its existing import 
bans and control measures, Chen said, but the Taiwan Government 
will insist on some sort of protection for local farmers. For 
instance, he said, import controls on citrus fruits, apples, and 
pears will not be eased until after the year 2000. 
  The US first asked Taiwan to cut tariffs on 8,048 products 
last November as a condition for Taiwan to enter the 
Geneva-based world trade body. It demanded Taiwan lower tariff 
rates on industrial products to below 10 percent and on 
agricultural goods to below 20 percent. 
  The two sides failed to reach agreement in the first round 
of 
formal consultations held here in February. The talks failed 
after the US demanded a 50 percent tariff cut on all 
agricultural products, which was 20 percent higher than Taiwan's 
offer. 
  Taiwan applied to join GATT in 1990 under the name "Customs 
territory of Taiwan, Kinmen and Matsu," and is expected to be 
admitted before the end of this year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 7 (CNA) -- Taiwan will further 
liberalize import trade in July in preparation for its entry to 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Board of 
Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Saturday [7 May]. 
  Beginning July 1, more than 90 percent of all imports will 
be 
allowed to enter Taiwan freely, the board said. 
  The board has drafted a "negative list" which will go into 
force July 1. Products on the list will either be prohibited 
from entering Taiwan or need import permits. 
  With the exception of those on the list, all other products, 
accounting for 92.4 percent of the 9,305 items covered in the 
BOFT- compiled product catalog, can be imported into Taiwan 
freely, BOFT officials said. 
  Products on the "negative list" make up only 7.6 percent of 
the total number of items covered in the official catalog, the 
officials noted, adding the list was designed mainly to protect 
some local industries, national security, public health and the 
environment. 
  The "negative list" comprises 227 items which are totally 
banned from importation and 479 other items which can be 
imported with BOFT permission. 
  Those items prohibited include intestines, rice, chickens, 
mushrooms and sugar, while those which need government 
permission before being imported include red beans, peanuts, 
[words indistinct], fruits, compact cars and motorcycles. 
  At present, 2.4 percent of products are prohibited from 
import, 6.3 percent need BOFT permission, 9.5 percent require 
import licenses issued by banks authorized by the BOFT, and 81.6 
percent can be imported freely. 
  After July 1, importers of 764 items which are not on the 
negative list must still present certificates issued by relevant 
government agencies, the officials said. Those products include 
medicines, animal feed, pesticides, medical equipment and 
publications. 
  Taiwan applied to join GATT in 1990 as a separate customs 
territory and is expected to become a full member by the end of 
this year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 6 (CNA) -- Taiwan companies will be 
allowed to manufacture 633 more products in Mainland China, 
Director-General Yin Chi-ming of the Industrial Development 
Bureau reported Friday [6 May]. 
  The green light brings the total number of industrial items 
allowed to be manufactured in the mainland to 4,444, or 70 
percent of the 6,771 industrial goods Taiwan companies currently 
manufacture, Yin noted. 
  The government made the decision following 29 rounds of 
talks 
with representatives of 12 key industries, including the 
information, consumer electronics, machinery, steelmaking, 
petrochemical, [word indistinct] and telecommunication 
industries, he said. 
  Of the new products allowed to be manufactured in Mainland 
China, 196 and 188 are textile and machinery products, 
respectively. 
  Even the automobile and information industries, both of 
which 
are considered vital to Taiwan's economy, have been approved to 
manufacture 18 and 16 items, respectively, in Mainland China, he 
pointed out. 
  Information products getting the go-ahead for mainland 
production include the 486 personal computer, he added. 
  Yin said the further relaxation of restrictions on 
investment 
in Mainland China will help create win-win opportunities on both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait.

  [Text] Nicaragua, May 5 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] has tentatively agreed to cancel 75 percent of the debt 
owed it by Nicaragua on a US$10 million loan, the ROC embassy 
announced Thursday [5 May]. 
  The ROC gave the Nicaraguan Sandanista Government the loan 
in 
the 1980s to help Nicaraguan cotton farmers, but the loan was 
not paid back in time and interest accumulated has pushed the 
amount of the loan to US$22 million.

  [Text] Taipei, May 7 (CNA) -- Loic Bouvard, chairman of the 
North Atlantic Assembly (NAA), said here Friday [6 May] that the 
Republic of China has made exceptional achievements in economic 
development ad political reform during the past years, paving 
the way for Taiwan's re-entry into international organizations. 
  Bouvard, who led a five-member NAA delegation to visit 
Taipei 
recently, said at a news conference before his departure that 
the NAA, an affiliated forum of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO), supports the Republic of China's [ROC] bid 
to join the United Nations, the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) and other world organizations. 
  The NAA chairman, who is also vice president of the National 
Assembly of France, singled out Taiwan's efforts in removing 
trade barriers as "commendable," and its economic performance 
"enviable." 
  Bouvard said he would be pleased to let Taiwan into the 
Brussels- based forum as an observer. Japan and Australia are 
also observers in the organization. 
  Jose Lello, a parliamentarian from Portugal, gave a positive 
account of Taiwan's protection of human rights and speech 
freedoms, saying that Mainland China lags far behind Taiwan in 
these two areas. 
  Taiwan's achievement in upholding human rights and speech 
freedoms will be salutary factors supporting the island's bid to 
join the international community, including the UN, GATT, and 
the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarian Forum, Lello maintained. 
  The NAA parliamentarians concluded their six-day visit in 
Taiwan and left Saturday. 
  During their stay, the delegation met with ROC Government 
officials, lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition 
parties, civic leaders and scholars. 
  Other members of the delegation included Peter Corterier, 
NAA 
secretary-general and vice foreign minister of the former West 
Germany; Janusz Onyszkiewicz, a polish parliamentarian; and 
Anders Sjaastad, a Norwegian lawmaker.

  [Text] Taipei, May 6 (CNA) -- Vice Transportation and 
Communications Minister Mao Chih-kuo was appointed acting 
director- general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) 
Friday [6 May]. 
  The appointment came after Transportation and Communications 
Minister Liu Chao-shuan approved the resignation of CAA 
Director- General Sun Chao-liang. 
  Sun submitted his resignation in the wake of the April 26 
China Airlines' Airbus crash at Nagoya, Japan. The crash, the 
worst in China Airlines' history, killed 264 of the 271 
passengers and crew aboard the plane. 
  Mao will assume his new post pending approval by Premier 
Lien 
Chan, Liu said. He will serve as acting CAA chief until the 
ministry finds a suitable replacement for sun. Mao will also 
keep his ministry post. 
  Mao said his first priority as director will be to reform 
Taiwan's air safety practices. He also plans to renovate air 
control systems, overhaul airport buildings and facilities and 
increase the number and improve the quality of air transport 
personnel, he added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- The basic policies 
taken by the Chinese Government towards the Hong Kong issue are 
not the result of the Sino-British talks, said a senior Chinese 
official here today. 
  "They were, as a matter of fact, laid on the negotiating 
table by the Chinese Government right from the beginning," the 
official said. 
  Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office 
of the State Council, made these remarks in a speech delivered 
here today at a luncheon given in his honor by several local 
organizations. 
  He said that before the Sino-British negotiation on the Hong 
Kong issue, the Chinese Government had worked out a 12-point 
policy regarding the Hong Kong issue under the instructions of 
the then top Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. 
  The 12-point policy, which was later laid down in the 
Sino-British joint declaration and in the Basic Law, is the 
basic policy of the Chinese Government regarding Hong Kong, he 
said. 
  According to Lu, before the Sino-British negotiation on the 
Hong Kong issue, Deng Xiaoping personally held talks with people 
from Hong Kong and sent people to Hong Kong for many times to 
make field studies. 
  A special team was then set up to look into this question, 
said Lu Ping. 
  As a member of the team himself, Lu said that the team first 
analysed the factors leading to the economic success in Hong 
Kong and the conditions under which they were formed. 
  He said that the 12-point policy was formulated following 
the 
positive answer that the team had got after studying whether 
these factors could continue after 1997. 
  Lu Ping quoted Deng Xiaoping's speech in 1984 while meeting 
with the then British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe as 
saying that "Hong Kong's prosperity and stability cannot be 
maintained without a guarantee on its continued capitalist 
system." 
  "I am confident that the principle of `one country, two 
systems' is workable," Deng Xiaoping was quoted as saying.

  [Text]Hong Kong, may 6 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese official 
reiterated here today that no matter what happens the principle 
of "one country, two systems" will not change for at least 50 
years. "I foresee that the principle of 'one country, two 
systems' will not change not only within 50 years, but much 
longer," said Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office of the State Council, at a luncheon given in his honor. 
"The obvious reason is that we are still in the primary stage 
of socialism. We need hundreds of years to build China into a 
strong socialist state. In this whole course of building 
socialism, Hong Kong will continue to play its important role as 
a bridge between China and the Western world," Lu said. "It is 
a correct policy, it is good for Hong Kong, good for the country 
and good for the rest of the world. It is also acceptable to 
all. Why would China want to change it?" he asked. The 
director said, "it is the responsibility of the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office to see that the principle of 'one country, 
two systems' as well as all the basic policies laid down in the 
joint declaration and the Basic Law are being fully carried 
out." The principle of "one country, two systems" is embodied 
in all the articles of the Basic Law, which was adopted by the 
National People's Congress and has become a national law, he 
said, adding that it has to be observed not only by Hong Kong 
but also by the rest of China for matters relating to Hong Kong. 
Noting that it took four years and eight months to work out 
the Basic Law, he said "if we are not serious in carrying out 
the principle of 'one country, two systems', why on earth should 
we spend such a lot of time, money and energy to put it into 
law?" "I wish to repeat that the principle of 'one country, 
two systems' is guaranteed by law," the director said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, may 6 (XINHUA) -- The "one country, two 
systems" policy is by no means a transient or an off-hand 
policy, nor is it a maneuver, said a senior Chinese official 
here today. 
  "It is truly China's long-term policy," said the official. 
  Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
of the State Council, made these remarks while delivering a 
speech at a luncheon jointly given by several local 
organizations. 
  In his speech, Lu elaborated on the reasons why China 
decided 
to adopt the "one country, two systems" principle to settle the 
Hong Kong issue. 
  Firstly, he said that the principle is the best and the only 
solution to maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong 
Kong. 
  "To look for a solution, we took into consideration the 
historical factor as well as the current status quo of Hong 
Kong," he said. 
  He said that "the solution will not only have to be 
acceptable to China, but also to Hong Kong and to the British 
side as well. There should be as little changes and 
disturbances as possible in 1997". 
  Secondly, the top official in charge of the Hong Kong 
affairs 
said that the principle is good for the country as a whole. 
  "For the four modernizations to succeed, we need a bridge to 
carry us to the Western world, and for the Western world to come 
to the China market," Lu said. 
  He said that Hong Kong hasbeen playing this role all along, 
and China wants it to continue to do so by retaining its 
capitalistic characteristics. 
  "We believe that a socialist mainland and a capitalist Hong 
Kong can co-exist in harmony in such a way that they can 
supplement each other instead of confronting each other," he 
said. 
  He pointed out that cities like Shanghai can never take the 
place of Hong Kong because no matter how developed Shanghai 
becomes, it will remain socialist. 
  "Shanghai will serve the country as a socialist metropolis, 
while Hong Kong will play a different role in its capacity as a 
capitalist special administrative region," he said. 
  Thirdly, Lu Ping said that the "one country, two systems" 
principle is a big move in the course of reunification of China. 
  "By offering Hong Kong as a blueprint to the settlement of 
the questions of Macao and Taiwan, China sets an example to the 
world that it can settle disputes in a peaceful way through 
mutual accommodation," Lu said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- In order to maintain 
the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, it is of vital 
importance to maintain the stability of the Chinese mainland, 
without which, the principle of "one country, two systems" will 
be built on sand, a Chinese official said. 
  "By `one country, two systems' we mean that the main body of 
the country practices socialism, which is the fundamental system 
of China, while as a supplement to the socialist state, Hong 
Kong continues to practice capitalism," said Lu Ping, director 
of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, at a 
luncheon given in his honor here today. 
  "When we say there will be no change in the principle of 
'one 
country, two systems', there are actually two aspects: the 
capitalist system of Hong Kong will remain unchanged, and the 
fundamental socialist system of the country will also not 
change," he said. 
  "Otherwise, it will be 'one country, one system', instead of 
'one country, two systems'," he said. 
  Lu said that some people believe that only when China turns 
capitalist, can Hong Kong's capitalism be guaranteed. "This is 
an entirely wrong concept," he said. 
  "If in case (which is an impossible supposition) China turns 
capitalist as some people wishfully think, where will Hong Kong 
stand? Can Hong Kong continue to play its role as a bridge, 
which contributes as a major factor to Hong Kong's prosperity 
and stability?" Lu asked. 
  He said that Chinese leaders are determined to build a 
strong 
socialist China and any movement or action to change this 
direction may cause chaos and disruption to the Chinese economy. 
Any foreign government or anyone in Hong Kong trying to exert 
pressure on the Chinese Government will not succeed. China 
would not want itself to be rampant with chaos, he said. 
  "Furthermore, can Hong Kong continue to prosper with a 
turbulent mainland at its back? During the Cultural Revolution 
(1966-1976), which was purely an internal conflict, Mao Zedong 
and Zhou Enlai to some extent, could still exercise some control 
over the 'Red Guards'. Do you know that in 1967 it was Premier 
Zhou Enlai who at the very last minute stopped the 'gang of 
four' to send troops to Hong Kong? 
  "Do you know that in order to maintain the prosperity and 
stability of Hong Kong, China has been imposing strict 
self-control on the exodus of immigrants to Hong Kong? 
  "It has been and still is, the People's Liberation Army 
which, under the strict orders of the central government, has 
been guarding the Hong Kong borders and maintaining the 
stability in Hong Kong," he added.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Every penny of the 
income from the land sales, which is kept by the Land Fund on 
behalf of the Chinese side of the Sino-British Land Commission, 
belongs to the Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government of 
Hong Kong, a Chinese official said here today. Lu Ping, 
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State 
Council, was speaking at a discussion with members of the 
preliminary working committee for the preparatory committee of 
the future SAR, deputies to the Chinese National People's 
Congress and members of the national committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference from the Hong Kong 
region. The annex 3 to the Sino-British Joint Declaration says 
that from the entry into force of the joint declaration until 
June 30, 1997, premium income obtained by the British-Hong Kong 
Government from land transactions shall, after deduction of the 
average cost of land production, be shared equally between the 
British-Hong Kong Government and the future SAR government. As 
the future SAR government has not come into being, the share 
belonging to the SAR Government is temporarily kept by the Land 
Fund entrusted by the Chinese side of the Sino-British Land 
Commission, Lu said. After the transfer of power in 1997, the 
Sino-British Land Commission will be dismissed and the land 
income kept by the Land Fund for the Chinese side will all be 
immediately handed over and subject to the disposal to the SAR 
government.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese top official on 
Hong Kong affairs Lu Ping said here today that Hong Kong's last 
Legislative Council and district boards will not be passed 
through 1997 and China will not compromise on this matter of 
principle. Lu Ping, deputy director and secretary-general of 
the preliminary working committee for the Preparatory Committee 
for Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said this 
during a meeting between the Chinese mainland members at the 
committee and Hong Kong deputies to the Chinese National 
People's Congress and local members of the national committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Lu 
said his committee will take into full consideration opinions 
from all walks of life in Hong Kong in order to ensure a smooth 
transfer of power in 1997. He stated that China originally 
hoped to solve the "through train" for the last Legislative 
Council in the territory, but the British side closed the door 
of cooperation. Thus, the Sino-British talks on arrangements 
for the 1994/95 elections broke down and there would be no 
"through train", Lu said. "But Governor Chris Patten does not 
believe there would be no through train. So I sincerely hope he 
would not cherish any illusion on that," Lu said. By July 1, 
1997, he continued, the first SAR Legislative Council will be 
produced in the territory according to the Basic Law and 
relevant regulations of the Chinese National People's Congress. 
At that time, all members of the last Legislative Council 
should step down the "train" and this is definite, Lu added. 
He noted that his committee will listen to various opinions on 
formation of the first SAR Legislative Council and of the 
district boards and ensure a smooth transition.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese official in 
charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs Lu Ping said here today 
that there is no atmosphere for him to meet Governor Chris 
Patten at present. 
  Lu Ping said that a meeting between him and Mr. Patten 
should 
be intended to produce results instead of making show. He added 
that a meeting without results would mean nothing but make 
people in Hong Kong more disappointed. 
  Lu Ping was speaking at a discussion with PWC [preliminary 
working committee] members, deputies to the Chinese National 
People's Congress and members of the national committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference here today. 
  Lu said that he had come here in the capacity of the deputy 
director and secretary-general of the PWC to attend meetings of 
political and economic affairs panels of the PWC. So he had no 
time to meet the governor because he had a full schedule here 
and he had to return to Beijing ahead of schedule to take care 
of business there. 
  "The British Hong Kong Government resists the PWC by not 
allowing civil servants to contact the PWC, however, the 
governor, as the top leader of the civil servants, asked to meet 
me. Isn't he contradicting himself?" Lu asked. 
  Lu held that the PWC and the civil servants should contact 
each other through different channels to lay down a foundation 
and create a satisfactory atmosphere in which he could meet the 
governor and the meeting could turn out results. 
  The British Hong Kong authorities expressed that they want 
to 
cooperate with the Chinese side in other fields, but people are 
judged by their deeds, not just by their words as Chinese 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said. 
  He said that the report of the House of Commons of Britain 
on 
the Sino-British relations acknowledged Britain's policies 
including those towards China had changed fundamentally from 
cooperation to confrontation. "The British side has shown no 
sign of sincerity to cooperate with China," he said. 
  "We want to cooperate with the British Hong Kong authorities 
in other fields but we will not compromise on matters of 
principle. The British Hong Kong authorities should show its 
sincerity," he added.

  [Text] China's top official on Hong Kong affairs, Lu Ping, 
yesterday launched his first attack on the Governor, Chris 
Patten, since arriving in the territory. 
  As Mr. Patten disappeared from sight, after a hectic week of 
high-profile activity, Mr. Lu accused him of only wanting to put 
on a political show, rather than sincerely engaging in talks, 
according to newly appointed District Affairs Adviser Leung 
Kwong-cheung, who attended a two-hour meeting with the visiting 
mainland official. 
  Mr. Lu insisted he would only meet the Governor if it was 
likely to be fruitful. "How could I meet Mr. Patten, he 
performs a show but I don't. His attitude towards the 
Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] is not only unfriendly but 
amounts to a boycott of us," the visiting mainland official was 
quoted as saying at a meeting with the district advisers. 
  "As secretary-general of the PWC, if I enter the room by the 
red carpet, then walk out along the red carpet, without making 
any progress, this would only disappoint the six million people 
in Hong Kong." 
  Mr. Lu also attacked the Kowloon Canton Railway Corporation 
for allegedly snubbing the PWC by failing to send its chairman 
Kevin Hyde to a meeting with the economic sub-group yesterday. 
The KCRC sent a consultant as its representative instead, and 
Mr. Lu said this was further evidence of the British side's lack 
of sincerity. 
  "Many of the PWC mainland members are department heads (in 
the Chinese Government). Is our meeting with the KCRC chairman 
downgrading his status?" Mr. Lu was reported as saying. 
  Secretary of Transport Haider Barma last night denied the 
Government had played any role in the KCRC's decision. "As far 
as I know, we did not have any role in this case. It (the 
decision) is entirely up to the KCRC, the board is independent 
from the Government. I only learned of their meeting and 
cancellation of the appointment from the newspapers," Mr. Barma 
said. 
  After a meeting with the specialist group on infrastructure 
of the Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong, head 
of the PWC economic sub-group Gao Shang-quan expressed his 
disappointment at the absence of Mr. Hyde. He said: "We, with 
four ministerial level officials, came to this meeting with 
tremendous sincerity and ambitions because this question 
(railway transportation) has to be solved very urgently." 
  According to sub-group member Tam Yiu-Chung, yesterday's 
meeting was originally arranged as a discussion with the KCRC 
only. But the PWC re-scheduled it to meet the infrastructure 
experts after receiving a negative reply from the KCRC. 
  A newly built Beijing-Kowloon railway will come into service 
in late 1995, and China wants to discuss with the KCRC the 
connection of the proposed railway to the western New 
Territories. 
  "If the question cannot be solved, it will cause economic 
loss to Hong Kong. And of course, it will cause economic loss 
to China also," Mr. Gao said. 
  Mr. Lu had earlier yesterday sought to ease the anxiety of 
civil servants by assuring them their future would not be 
affected by the Sino-British row. 
  Representatives from seven civil servant associations held 
almost three hours of talks with Mr. Lu and members of the PWC 
political subgroup.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Chengbin (1327 2110 2430)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 6 May (XINHUA) -- During a forum this 
morning between mainland-based members of the Preliminary 
Working Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee for the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR], and local 
deputies to the National People's Congress [NPC] and local 
members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, Lu Ping, PWC vice chairman 
and secretary general, delivered an important speech on several 
current issues which are being universally followed by the Hong 
Kong people and deliberately misguided by the British Hong Kong 
authorities. 
  Speaking of the "through train" issue, Lu Ping said: We had 
originally hoped to solve the "through train" issue for members 
of the last British Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] 
through negotiations in accordance with relevant NPC provisions. 
Because the British side has shut the door tight, Sino-British 
talks on arrangements for the 1994/95 elections have broken 
down, making it impossible to realize the "through train" 
concept; this is certainly not what we had hoped for. However, 
Mr. Chris Patten does not believe that there will be no "through 
train" after 1997. I would like to advise him not to cherish 
any illusion about that. By 1 July 1997, we will form anew the 
first SAR legislature according to the Basic Law and relevant 
NPC provisions. 
  Lu Ping said: The relevant NPC decision explicitly states 
that the last Legco should be constituted in conformity with the 
Basic Law and the provisions of the decision if it is directly 
to become the first SAR legislature; otherwise, there will be no 
premise for a direct transition. Also, the NPC decision 
authorizes the SAR Preparatory Committee to draw up specific 
methods for constituting the first SAR legislature in accordance 
with the Basic Law. The methods encompass such issues as how to 
delineate electoral districts for direct elections along 
geographical lines, what election methods will be adopted, what 
new functional constituencies will be introduced, and how to 
constitute the election committee. 
  Lu Ping said: The British Hong Kong authorities proposed the 
"constitutional reform package" in 1992, and are now proposing 
another amendment plan. The Chinese side was never consulted on 
the amendment plan, which is simply unacceptable. In the 
future, we will surely act in accordance with the Basic Law and 
the NPC decision. We believe that this will by no means cause a 
stir in Hong Kong, and will surely facilitate the realization of 
smooth transition. 
  Lu Ping went on: The "through train" is a single unit; there 
is no question of a through "carriage." No illusion should be 
cherished about this. On 1 July 1997, all members of the last 
British Hong Kong Legco will get off the train. This is for 
sure, and there is no doubt about that. 
  On district organizations, Lu Ping stated emphatically: 
Neither the NPC decision nor the Basic Law provides for 
allowing the British Hong Kong district organizations to make 
the transition beyond 1997. To be sure, we are hopeful that the 
British side will cooperate with us so that the district 
organizations will also make the transition beyond 1997. 
Unfortunately, the British side has shut the door tight in this 
respect, causing a breakdown of Sino-British talks on the 1994 
elections for district organizations. Therefore, there is also 
no question of a "through train" in this matter. 
  Lu Ping said: The last British Hong Kong Legco can only be 
a short-lived one, with just another 22 months to live. When 
considering the methods for forming the first SAR legislature 
and district organizations, the PWC will certainly listen fully 
to the opinions of various sectors in Hong Kong and make every 
effort to ensure a smooth transition. Nevertheless, we cannot 
compromise on matters of principle. The principle is: Given 
the breakdown of Sino-British talks, the last British Hong Kong 
Legco cannot become the first SAR legislature and the British 
Hong Kong district organizations cannot become district 
organizations in the SAR. 
  Lu Ping said: The PWC invited relevant civil servants from 
the British Hong Kong Government to this forum in Hong Kong for 
a briefing; this was a good thing because it could help solve 
some problems. However, the British Hong Kong Government 
boycotted the PWC by not allowing the civil servants to come in 
contact with the PWC. This shows a lack of sincerity on the 
part of the British Hong Kong Government to cooperate with the 
Chinese side in other fields. 
  Lu Ping reiterated: The PWC's door of contact and 
cooperation with Hong Kong's civil servants is always open, and 
our invitation remains valid. 
  Lu Ping said: The British Hong Kong Government has signaled 
its intention to cooperate with the Chinese side in other 
fields. However, in the words of Vice Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen, verbal statements offer no guarantees. 
Practical actions should be taken, and we should "listen to 
what a person says and watch what he does." Lu Ping stated: 
The Foreign Affairs Committee of the British Parliament, in its 
report, recognizes in no uncertain terms that Britain's policy 
toward China, Hong Kong included, has undergone fundamental 
changes; this means moving from cooperation to confrontation. 
We have not yet detected any sign of sincerity about 
cooperation or any gesture of cooperation on the British side. 
While the Chinese side is willing to cooperate with the British 
Hong Kong Government in other fields, it cannot compromise on 
matters of principle. The British Hong Kong Government must 
show genuine sincerity about cooperation. 
  Someone asked: Some people have called for the creation of a 
human rights commission in Hong Kong. What comment does the 
Chinese side have on this proposal? Lu Ping replied: According 
to the concept of these people, the commission will be an organ 
of power. However, it will not be part of the executive organ 
prescribed in the Basic Law, a legislative organ, or a judicial 
organ. According to the Basic Law, Hong Kong's executive organ 
includes the Audit Department and the Independent Commission 
Against Corruption. The Basic Law also contains explicit 
provisions concerning the legislative and judicial organs. 
Hence, the creation of a human rights commission will obviously 
contradict the Basic Law and destroy the entire framework 
established by the Basic Law. 
  Lu Ping said: Since the human rights commission will be an 
organ of power, it will necessarily erode the power of other 
organs and cause instability in Hong Kong. He asked in return: 
Will there be no guarantees for human rights in the absence of 
a human rights commission? Britain does not have a human rights 
commission; it does not even have a human rights law. Are there 
no human rights in Britain? Proponents of a human rights 
commission are like "drinkers whose intentions lie not in the 
wine" [people with ulterior motives]. 
  In response to a demand that the Chinese Government 
regularly 
report to the UN Human Rights Commission on the situation of 
human rights in Hong Kong after 1997, Lu Ping said: China is 
not a party to the two human rights conventions and has no 
responsibilities or obligations whatsoever to report to the UN 
Human Rights Commission. Hong Kong is not a political entity, 
and it is not qualified to report to the UN Human Rights 
Commission. The Basic Law explicitly states that those parts of 
the two human rights conventions that apply to Hong Kong will be 
implemented through Hong Kong's local laws after 1997. In other 
words, the two human rights conventions cannot be applied to 
Hong Kong directly. A consensus was reached on this point when 
the Basic Law was drafted. 
  Lu Ping said: Hong Kong citizens will enjoy broad-based 
rights after 1997, for which the Basic Law provides full legal 
guarantees. 
  Replying to a question on the SAR Government's land fund, Lu 
Ping stated: Every cent of the land fund belongs to the future 
SAR Government. Chinese representatives to the Sino-British 
Land Commission, acting in accordance with the mandate given by 
the PRC Government, is responsible for the fund's collection and 
safekeeping, as well as for the preservation of its value, in 
their capacity as trustees. After 1997, the SAR Government will 
administer the fund. 
  Lu Ping said: Annex III of the Joint Declaration explicitly 
states that upon the entry into force of the Joint Declaration, 
half of the income earned by the British Hong Kong Government 
from land transactions shall be left to the future SAR 
Government. Because the SAR Government will not be established 
before 1997, Chinese representatives to the Sino-British Land 
Commission, in their capacity as trustees, are now responsible 
for the collection and safekeeping of this portion of income, as 
well as for preserving its value. The Sino-British Land 
Commission will be abolished after 1997. Hence, the PWC's 
economic affairs panel has suggested transferring the land fund 
to the SAR Government after 1 July 1997. The SAR Government will 
decide which organization will receive and take care of the fund.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Sun Chengbin (1327 2110 2430)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 7 May (XINHUA) -- Lu Ping, vice chairman 
and secretary general of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] of 
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [HKSAR], said today: The disputes over 
political structure between China and Britain will definitely 
not affect China's policy toward Hong Kong's public servants. 
We hope Hong Kong's public servants will continue to work for 
the HKSAR Government after 1997. The HKSAR Government will 
certainly act according to the Basic Law, and the interests of 
the public servants are protected by law. 
  This morning, mainland members of the PWC held a discussion 
with the principal responsible persons of seven Hong Kong public 
servants' organizations, hearing their opinions and suggestions 
on matters related to public servants. The seven organizations 
are (?the Association of Hong Kong Government Employees of 
Chinese Descent, Hong Kong Retired Public Servants Welfare 
Society, Hong Kong Public Servants Federation, Hong Kong 
Government Employees Association, Hong Kong Federation of Public 
Servant Unions, Hong Kong Retired Public Servants Association, 
and Hong Kong Local Public Servants Association.) 
  After attentively listening to the views of the responsible 
persons of these seven organizations, Lu Ping said: The current 
disputes between China and Britain will definitely not affect 
China's policy towards public servants. In other words, the 
articles in the Basic Law concerning public servants will 
definitely not be affected and will be carried out as they are 
currently stipulated. Hong Kong public servants may rest 
assured in this. He urged those responsible persons present at 
the meeting to publicize his reassurance among the members of 
their organizations. 
  Lu Ping stated: According to the Basic Law, the principal 
officials of the HKSAR Government shall be Chinese citizens who 
are permanent residents of the region, and who shall be 
nominated by the chief executive and appointed by the central 
government. Besides the principal officials, we hope all other 
public servants will remain and continue to work at their 
present posts after 1 July 1997. He reassured the public 
servants that the break of the Sino- British talks will 
definitely not affect their future, although the two countries 
could no longer cooperate in Hong Kong's political structure. 
  Lu Ping said: Some people are worried whether the financial 
strains of the HKSAR Government will affect the public servants' 
retirement pensions after 1 July 1997. I would like to reassure 
you we have already taken the matter into account. Besides, 
according to the Basic Law, the HKSAR Government shall strive to 
achieve fiscal balance and "keep expenditures within the limits 
of revenues." However, the budgeted expenditures must include 
the retirement pensions of public servants. 
  He emphasized: The retirement pensions of public servants 
after 1997 are clearly stipulated in the Basic Law and are 
protected by that law; they will not be affected by the 
Sino-British disputes. 
  Lu Ping added: Of course we also support your proposal on 
establishing a pension fund before 1997. The British Hong Kong 
Government has proposed to establish a HK$7-billion pension 
fund. The amount is of course far from sufficient. However, 
even if the pension fund is not established, the HKSAR 
Government will surely pay your retirement pensions, and those 
pensions are guaranteed. Please rest assured in this regard. 
This is Chinese Government policy and has been stipulated in 
the Basic Law. We will certainly act according to the law. 
  Lu Ping said: Some people have suggested that a consultancy 
group for public servant issues be established within the PWC's 
Political Affairs Subcommittee. This is a good suggestion. It 
is important to establish a formal channel of communications, 
constantly exchange views, and avoid unnecessary 
misunderstandings between the PWC and public servants. He said 
the PWC would study the suggestion. 
  Lu Ping also stated: Besides the PWC, there are many other 
channels of communication available. For instance, within the 
Hong Kong branch of the XINHUA News Agency there is a special 
department handling public servant issues. He hoped Hong Kong 
public servants will not hesitate to bring their questions to 
that department. 
  According to Lu Ping, the British Hong Kong Government is 
not very enthusiastic about contacts between the public servants 
and the PWC, and sometimes purposefully creates obstacles. 
Citing an example, he said: The PWC has extended an invitation 
to officials of the departments concerned within the British 
Hong Kong Government to come and explain the draft regulations 
for the new airport administration. It is a simple matter, but 
the British Hong Kong Government issued an order prohibiting 
them from contact with us. To facilitate coordination over 
railroad construction and connection, responsible persons of the 
Guangzhou-Jiulong Railroad Company were supposed to attend a 
discussion with members of the PWC's Economic Affairs 
Subcommittee this morning. The meeting is for a good purpose, 
and both the time and place have been set, but they changed 
their mind at the last minute. Lu Ping stated: These tricks 
are completely unnecessary. We are very willing to establish a 
constant channel of communication between us and the public 
servants. For the sake of a smooth transition and to reassure 
public servants, and for the sake of normal operations of the 
HKSAR Government in the future, we still hope you will keep in 
touch with us, despite the British Hong Kong Government's 
deliberate obstruction. 
  Lu Ping added: After 1997, public servants will not be 
required to express their political attitude. The suggestion 
made earlier by the PWC's Political Affairs Subcommittee is 
merely for the purpose of reminding any public servant who does 
not want to stay and work for the HKSAR Government in 1997 to 
give the government notice beforehand so that a replacement can 
be found to facilitate normal operation of the HKSAR Government. 
  In the afternoon, the members of the PWC's Political Affairs 
and Economic Affairs Subcommittees held a discussion with more 
than 20 district advisers.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 8 May (XINHUA) -- On 8 May, mainland 
members of the political and economic groups of the Preliminary 
Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region took part in a discussion meeting 
with people from various social organizations at the grassroots 
level in Hong Kong to extensively hear their opinions and 
suggestions on matters related to Hong Kong's transition, the 
work of the Preliminary Working Committee, and issues concerning 
the living conditions in Hong Kong, which are things of great 
interest to Hong Kong residents. 
  Zheng Guoxiong, XINHUA Hong Kong Branch deputy director, 
presided over the discussion meeting. Groups taking part in the 
discussion meeting included the Hong Kong Educational Workers' 
Association, the New Territory Social Groups Association, the 
Housing Occupants Association, the Hong Kong Friends of Study 
Society, and the Hong Kong Association of Chinese for Reform. 
  At the discussion meeting, participants fully expressed 
their 
opinions. Members of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions 
and the Hong Kong Housing Occupants Association expressed their 
opinions and put forward a lot of constructive suggestions on 
social securities for retired workers and the "three highs" 
situation, namely "high land prices, high apartment prices, and 
high rent." The Hong Kong Educational Workers' Association 
suggested holding a joint meeting with the participation of Hong 
Kong's educational workers to strengthen contacts and relations 
with the cultural group of the Preliminary Working Committee and 
reflect the views and wishes of the educational circles on Hong 
Kong affairs during the transitional period. They also 
suggested further popularizing Hong Kong Basic Law at middle and 
primary schools in Hong Kong and strengthening relations between 
educational circles in Hong Kong and Mainland China. The New 
Territory Social Groups Association put forward suggestions on 
speeding up the harnessing of the Shenzhen River, making an 
overall plan for transportation between Hong Kong and Guangdong, 
and simplifying customs inspection procedures and ensuring the 
smooth passage of people and vehicles through Shenzhen. The Hong 
Kong Friends of Study Society also put forward some suggestions 
on youth work in Hong Kong. 
  Lu Ping, vice chairman and concurrently secretary general of 
the Preliminary Working Committee seriously heard their remarks 
and said: The masses at the grassroots level in Hong Kong are 
the rudiments of Hong Kong's foundation and are Hong Kong's 
roots. The so-called "governing Hong Kong by people in Hong 
Kong" [gang ren zhi gang 3263 0086 3112 3263] must not be 
narrowly interpreted as governing Hong Kong by the small number 
of people from government departments. The connotation of 
"governing Hong Kong by people in Hong Kong" is quite extensive. 
First, we should let the broad masses of residents at the 
grassroots level govern Hong Kong. We will realize Hong Kong's 
stability and prosperity in the future through "governing Hong 
Kong by people in Hong Kong." Lu Ping said: He hope that you 
will give full play to the power of Hong Kong residents and 
everyone should join efforts to realize "governing Hong Kong by 
people in Hong Kong." 
  Lu Ping said: I earlier said that Hong Kong is an economic 
city and we hope that it will not be changed into a political 
city. I said this with Hong Kong's special characteristics in 
mind [wo zhe mo jiang shi you zhen dui xing di 2053 6638 8010 
6199 2508 2589 6859 1417 1840 4104]. He hoped that everyone 
would show solicitude to the transitional work in Hong Kong and 
care for political affairs and the future of Hong Kong. 
  Lu Ping reiterated that the Chinese side is willing to 
cooperate with the British side in other fields. He said: 
However, cooperation is a two-way thing. The key to whether 
the cooperation can be successful or not lies in whether the 
British side has sincerity or not. We have not seen any such 
signs at present. 
  Zhang Junsheng, XINHUA Hong Kong Branch deputy director, 
also 
attended today's discussion meeting.

  [Text] Beijing's top official on Hong Kong affairs, Lu 
Ping, is backing the creation of a group to improve 
communications between civil servants and China during the 
transitional period of power. 
  Mr. Lu and Preliminary Working Committee members met 
representatives of seven local civil servants' unions yesterday 
for two-and-a-half hours. Unions included the Hong Kong Chinese 
Civil Servants Association and the Senior Non-Expatriate 
Officers Association. The Association for Expatriate Civil 
Servants was excluded from the meeting. 
  Last year the government issued a directive asking civil 
servants to turn down invitations from the Preliminary Working 
Committee to discuss transitional matters. Leader of the 
Government Employees Association Cheng Chung-wai proposed that 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) members and civil servant 
unions form a group despite the government directive. 
  Senior Non-Expatriate Officers Association deputy chairman 
Alex Au said his union would welcome the move as it would 
improve the transparency of the group which advises China on 
transitional matters, but it depended on the composition. "We 
would know what's happening about transitional matters relating 
to the civil service," he said. 
  Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants Association chairman Peter 
Wong said he hoped the PWC would consult the unions before 
announcing or disclosing its proposals. "It would make their 
recommendations more credible," Mr. Wong said. 
  A government spokesman, however, reiterated the 
administration's stance, saying there were enough channels of 
communication to deal with transition matters. They should only 
be dealt with by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. 
  Local unions also secured assurances from Mr. Lu that 
China's 
policy towards Hong Kong would not be affected by the continuing 
row between Britain and China. 
  Mr. Lu told the unions he hoped all civil servants could 
remain in their posts, apart from those in the directorate, 
which would be appointed by the Chief Executive of the Special 
Administrative Region. 
  He also backed calls by the unions for more cash to be put 
into the pension reserve fund, but refused to disclose how much. 
Governor Chris Patten announced in his policy speech last 
October that $7 billion would be injected into the fund over a 
two-year period. 
  The Association of Expatriate Civil Servants vice-chairman 
Allan Roger said his group met Mr. Lu in 1986 and had been 
assured China was happy to have expatriates in the civil service 
after 1997. 
  "We basically wanted China's public reassurance that they 
still want expats in government. At that time the expat 
population was 3.2 per cent of the civil service, and Mr. Lu 
said that was fine. Now it is down to 1.2 per cent and it is 
clear what the government here is trying to do. Frankly, we 
don't place a great deal of store in what they (China) are going 
to say one way or the other, because we are convinced it is not 
a Beijing driven scheme anyway. It is definitely a local 
government move."

  [Text] Hong Kong, 6 May (XINHUA) -- An economic panel of 
the Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] for the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [HKSAR] 
held the sixth meeting in Hong Kong from 4 to 5 May. PWC deputy 
director Henry Fok Ying-Tung and Lu Ping, PWC deputy director 
and secretary-general, attended the meeting. 
  The meeting discussed a study report on the handing over and 
post-1997 management of the HKSAR's land funds, pointing out 
that the land funds are important financial reserves for the 
future HKSAR government and suggesting that, as of 1 July 1997, 
all of the land funds be handed over and subject to the disposal 
to the HKSAR government. To better handle the handing over, it 
is necessary to make preparations in advance. 
  The meeting again discussed the coordination of large-scale 
capital construction in Hong Kong and Guangdong Province and 
held that the two localities both face the problem to coordinate 
management over railway, highway, land transportation ports, 
harbors, and air transportation. If the problem is not resolved 
soon, it will affect Hong Kong's longterm development and 
exchanges between the two localities. The meeting called on the 
British-Hong Kong Government and the departments concerned in 
the hinterland to set up a planning organ soon, so as to discuss 
and resolve relevant issues. 
  This meeting also heard and discussed a report by a study 
group on Hong Kong's land and housing policies under the 
economic panel on its work since March. The meeting held that 
the rising of real estate prices in Hong Kong has drawn Hong 
Kong residents' and investors' attention. This problem has a 
bearing on the people's livelihood and social stability; on Hong 
Kong's competitiveness as an international banking and trading 
center; and on its smooth transition. They said they will 
earnestly study the current state and longterm development plan 
for Hong Kong's land and housing policies; and will make 
opinions and suggestions for relevant parties' reference. 
  At the meeting, members heard a briefing by Huang Diyan, 
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Administration, Bank of 
China, on the bank's Hong Kong branch participating in issuing 
the Hong Kong currency; and a midterm work report by a study 
group on security for the retired under the economic panel. 
  The economic panel will hold the 7th meeting in Beijing from 
8 to 9 June.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese official in 
charge of Hong Kong and Macao affairs Lu Ping here today 
encouraged women and other people here to make contributions to 
the smooth transfer of power of Hong Kong in 1997. 
  During his visit to Hong Kong Federation of Women here this 
afternoon, Lu Ping, deputy director and secretary-general of the 
preliminary working committee (PWC) of the Preparatory Committee 
of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, urged the 
organization to unite more women to work for the transition, 
including publicizing the principle of "one country, two 
systems" and the Basic Law. 
  The establishment of the PWC provides opportunities for Hong 
Kong people to do their shares in this regards, he said. 
  Lu Ping completed a busy schedule today after attending the

  [Text] Lu Ping's official remarks that late premier Zhou 
Enlai intervened to stop the Gang of Four sending troops to Hong 
Kong in 1967 was received by veteran left-wingers with surprise. 
  "I've never heard that before," a senior mainland cadre 
involved with Hong Kong affairs said. 
  Another left-winger who was involved in the 1967 riots said 
he had been told "internally" that "we must stop the military 
confrontation with the British colonial authorities". 
  "We understand that the order came from Chairman Mao Zedong 
and premier Zhou Enlai at that time. But I don't think that has 
been mentioned in official media," he recalled. 
  Mr. Lu said in his speech yesterday: "Back in 1967, it was 
Premier Zhou Enlai who at the very last minute stopped the 'Gang 
of Four' sending troops to Hong Kong."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Lu Ping's Speech Stands to Reason"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office under the State Council, made a splendid 
speech at a luncheon jointly held by five major chamber of 
commerce organizations in Hong Kong. The speech elicited 
enthusiastic applause. 
  The subject Lu Ping dealt with was familiar to every Hong 
Kong resident: The implementation of the principle of "one 
country, two systems." Lu covered the background against which 
the principle was formed, the Chinese Government's determination 
to maintain the principle, the close relations characterized by 
coexistence in harmony and supplementing each other between Hong 
Kong and the mainland, and the central government's policy of 
allowing Hong Kong people to enjoy a high degree of autonomy and 
to administer Hong Kong, ending his speech with "all of you 
present here today will be given the chance to further Fat Choy 
[make money]." Lu's speech stands to reason, engenders a 
feeling of freshness, and is cordial and touching. We would 
like to suggest to people in all walks of life that they should 
carefully read the speech. 
  In his speech, Lu analyzed the value of Hong Kong to China 
from the high plane of the principle of "one country, two 
systems." He stressed: "The value of Hong Kong to China has 
been, and will be, its economic value. Hong Kong has always 
been an economic city, never a political city." "It is 
precisely on the basis of Hong Kong's economic value that China 
formulates its present policy towards Hong Kong." "In the whole 
course of building socialism, Hong Kong will continue to play 
its important role as a bridge between China and the Western 
world." Lu made a practical assessment of Hong Kong's role, an 
assessment which conforms with the interests and aspirations of 
the six million Hong Kong people. Every Hong Kong resident hopes 
that Hong Kong will always be a prosperous and stable economic 
city and does not want to see Hong Kong change into a site where 
various political forces wrestle with one another. 
  Just as Lu Ping pointed out, some people do wishfully plan 
to 
turn Hong Kong into a political city in order to influence the 
mainland in the sense of politics. 
  In response to Lu's speech, Chris Patten said: "I do not 
believe that Hong Kong can only be taken as a economic 
laboratory," "it is a society full of various types of political 
ambitions." What he meant was quite clear. The British side 
does hope that Hong Kong will become a "political city." In 
July last year British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said: 
China must acknowledge Hong Kong's "political reality." Hong 
Kong "is continuing to evolve." "It is now a political city as 
well as an international city." 
  These are not only their "words" but also their "deeds." 
Since he came to Hong Kong, Patten has not been interested in 
Hong Kong's economic development or the people's livelihood; 
instead, he devoted all his energy to challenging China and 
pursuing his "three violations" constitutional reform package in 
order to, in Hurd's words, change Hong Kong into a "political 
city" and "to establish a long-term political electoral system 
before 1997." 
  In its recent report, the British Parliament Foreign Affairs 
Committee summarized Britain's duties to Hong Kong as follows: 
"Our duties will include setting up a legislative structure and 
safeguarding Hong Kong's freedom through improving the 
regulations on guaranteeing human rights." The committee also 
claimed that it will urge the government to see to it that the 
international community will continue its support for 
safeguarding Hong Kong's human rights and rule of law." 
  It is clear that Britain is taking political action 
characterized by "grasping two links at the same time," namely, 
keeping tabs on both the political system and human rights. 
While trying to set up a set of organizations which can 
manipulate the political situation through "taking independent 
action," they are planning to protect those elements who are 
hostile to China and ready to create trouble or even turmoil by 
setting up a human rights committee and working out or amending 
several so-called laws and ordinances safeguarding human rights. 
Patten is probably planning to turn Hong Kong into a "political 
laboratory," which can influence and change the mainland in the 
sense of politics. The British side has kept saying it will put 
into effect the principle of "one country, two systems," but 
they only pay lip service and actually undermine the principle 
instead. 
  When we say there will be no change in the principle of "one 
country, two systems," there are actually two aspects: The 
capitalist system of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan will remain 
unchanged, but the socialist system of the main body of the 
country will also not change, Deng Xiaoping once said. Only 
when the socialism on the mainland prospers, can Hong Kong play 
its role as a bridge between China and the Western world and 
maintain its long- term prosperity and stability. Of course, 
with Hong Kong playing the role as a bridge, the mainland will 
do a better job in socialist modernizations. Therefore, nobody 
is allowed to change the capitalist system practiced in Hong 
Kong or the socialist system practiced on the mainland. We must 
especially watch out for those who try to change Hong Kong into 
a base hostile to the mainland under the pretext of "expanding 
democracy." 
  The Chinese Government has made great efforts to maintain 
Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. In his speech, Lu cited 
many examples. Back in 1967, when the Cultural Revolution was 
still in progress, it was Premier Zhou Enlai who at the very 
last minute stopped the "Gang of Four" from sending troops to 
Hong Kong. It has been, and still is, the People's Liberation 
Army, under the strict orders of the central government, who 
have been guarding the Hong Kong borders. In the transitional 
period, the Chinese Government has handled major Hong Kong 
issues in the interest of Hong Kong people. State leaders have 
repeatedly warned that no departments shall deal with Hong Kong 
as they did with Shanghai; that no departments, provinces, or 
municipalities are allowed to interfere in the internal affairs 
of the Hong Kong SAR; and that Hong Kong people must be allowed 
to administer Hong Kong and be given a high degree of autonomy 
as stipulated, and so on. Hong Kong people should have full 
confidence in Hong Kong's and their own future and also support 
socialism on the mainland by building up a better Hong Kong so 
that under the PRC flag the two systems will stand side by side 
for a long time and the two places, Hong Kong and the mainland, 
will enjoy long-term prosperity.

  [Text] Beijing, May 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin stressed during his talks with Kenyan President Daniel T. 
Arap Moi that China is willing to further the friendly 
cooperation with Kenya and strengthen the bilateral coordination 
and discussion of international affairs. 
  During the talks lasting over one hour here this afternoon, 
the two sides exchanged views on bilateral ties and African and 
international issues. 
  Both of them expressed satisfaction with the smooth 
development of Sino-Kenyan ties and shared the views that the 
two countries, as developing ones, face the same tasks of 
safeguarding peace and seeking development and that improving 
bilateral relations is in the interest of the two peoples. 
  Jiang said that Moi, who had visited China twice, was an old 
friend well-known and respected by the Chinese people. 
  He pointed out that China attached great importance to its 
relations with Kenya and would like to consistently strengthen 
and develop the cooperative ties in various fields on the basis 
of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. 
  Jiang expressed his appreciation for Kenya's one-China 
policy 
and extended his thanks for Kenya's support of China to resume 
its signatory status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. 
  The two countries have supported and cooperated with each 
other on the human rights issue, he said, adding that China 
would like to further its cooperation and discussions with Kenya 
on other international issues. 
  On bilateral economic and technological cooperation, Jiang 
said that the Chinese Government encourages its companies to 
conduct business abroad, and he hoped that the two countries 
would carry out various people-to-people economic exchanges as 
well as governmental cooperation. 
  Jiang also spoke highly of Moi's stand for Africans handling 
African affairs by themselves, opposing foreign interference, 
establishing a political and economic system according to each 
country's own situation, and strengthening unity of the nations. 
  He gave a briefing to the guests on China's reform and 
opening and the idea of implementing a socialist market economy, 
as well as on China's independent foreign policy. 
  Moi said that the aim of the visit is to meet with the 
Chinese leaders and acquaint himself with China's economy in an 
effort to learn from each other and seek common development. 
  He said that the two countries had many common views on such 
international issues as human rights, and no country should 
impose its human rights conception on others since the domestic 
situations were different. 
  He reaffirmed Kenya's one-China stand and warmly invited 
Jiang to visit Kenya. 
  After the talks, the two presidents participated in the 
signing ceremony of the bilateral agreement on economic and 
technological cooperation, agreement on culture between 1994 and 
1996, and protocol on educational exchanges. 
  Among those present at the talks were Qian Qichen, Chinese 
vice- premier and foreign minister, Tian Zengpei, deputy foreign 
minister, Chen Changben, chairman of the Chinese Government 
Reception Committee and deputy culture minister, Chen Pingchu, 
Chinese Ambassador to Kenya, S.K. Musyoka, minister of foreign 
affairs and international cooperation, J.J. Kamotho, minister of 
education, and James Simani, Kenyan ambassador to China. 
  Before the talks, Jiang Zemin held a greeting ceremony in 
honor of Moi. 
  This morning, the Kenyan President laid a wreath at the 
Monument to the People's Heroes. 
  The two sides also held ministerial talks today on 
furthering 
bilateral educational and agriculture ties.

  [Text] Helsinki, 4 May (XINHUA) -- (Numining), chairman of 
the Finnish-Chinese Trade Association, hosted a welcoming 
luncheon here today for the visiting Li Ruihuan, chairman of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. They both 
delivered speeches at the luncheon and said that they would make 
common efforts to further promote the development of economic 
and trade relations between the two countries. 
  At the beginning of his speech, Li Ruihuan briefed those at 
the luncheon on China's reform and opening up. He said that 
1994 marks an important year for China's continued reform 
efforts. This year will see the concentrated introduction of 
the largest number of new reform measures. The new reform 
measures will be unprecedented in terms of their scale, scope, 
difficulty, and their being in-depth in nature. Our general 
policy is: seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, 
promote development, and maintain stability. With the 
advancement of reform and opening up, China's economy has made 
great strides and has entered the period of sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development, which gives foreign businesses a great 
opportunity for carrying out economic and trade cooperation with 
China. 
  Li Ruihuan said that Finland is an industrialized and 
developed country and that it possesses advanced technologies in 
many economic sectors. Seen from the perspective of the 
complementary nature of the two countries' economies and from 
the respective countries' economic strengths, there are great 
potentials for cooperation between the two countries, and such 
potentials need to be further tapped. He added that he would 
like to take this opportunity to tell Finish business circles 
that the Finnish experience means much to China, that Finnish 
technology is useful to China, and that China is interested in 
and has confidence in expanding economic and trade relations 
with Finland. China welcomes more Finnish businessmen to invest 
in China, to trade with China, and to participate in China's 
modernization construction. 
  (Numining) said that China's reform and opening up have 
provided conditions for expanding Finnish-Chinese economic and 
trade cooperation and have helped make it possible for the two 
countries to achieve marked progress in their bilateral economic 
and trade ties. The increase in the exchange of high-level 
visits in recent years has further promoted the economic and 
trade relationship between the two countries. He expressed the 
belief that Chairman Li's current visit would further promote 
the development of bilateral economic and trade ties. 
  Li Ruihuan also fielded Finnish businessmen's questions at 
the luncheon.

(7458 4423 5468)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 May (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li 
Peng today met in Beijing with all council members attending the 
national council meeting of the Chinese People's Association for 
Friendship With Foreign Countries [CPAFWFC]. 
  On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, Li 
Peng extended his warm congratulations to the 40th anniversary 
of the founding of the CPAFWFC and to the opening of the meeting 
of the CPAFWFC's new national council. He said: Since the 
founding of the CPAFWFC 40 years ago, it has held high the 
banner of peace and friendship, has set its eyes on the whole 
world, has made friends all over the world, and has done a great 
deal to win international support and sympathy for the country's 
construction. Today, China's international status is the 
highest it has ever been, and we have friends around the world 
-- these are the result of the painstaking labor of the 
proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation in promoting 
people-to-people diplomatic work, and of the diligent work of 
the large numbers of comrades engaging in people-to-people 
diplomatic work. 
  Li Peng said: Diplomatic and domestic work are closely 
related. Achievements in domestic work are the foundation for 
diplomatic work, and achievements in diplomatic work boost the 
development of domestic work. The underlying purpose of China's 
independent foreign policy of peace is to create a good 
international environment for the country's four modernizations 
drive. 
  Li Peng added: The work of the CPAFWFC and other 
nongovernment friendship organizations and groups shows that 
people-to-people diplomatic work is an effective supplement to 
official diplomatic efforts. Official diplomatic efforts should 
be integrated with people-to-people diplomatic work, and the two 
should be made mutually supporting; the prospects for 
people-to-people diplomatic work are very broad. 
  Li Peng said: "During the session of the CPAFWFC's last 
council meeting, I met with representatives attending a 
conference on friendship cities work. I told the conference's 
attendees that the spring of China's diplomatic work had 
arrived. Judging from the current situation, our prediction 
then has become a reality." 
  Speaking on the international situation and China's 
diplomatic principle, Li Peng said: The international situation 
currently is in a period in which the old setup is being 
transformed into a new one; the multipolar trend has further 
developed. Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's guidelines, over 
the last few years we have kept ourselves coolheaded and sober 
in observing, analyzing, and judging the development of the 
international situation, thus enabling us to continue to open up 
new situations in diplomatic work. The international community 
has widely applauded China's important proposals to establish a 
fair and reasonable new international order based on the Five 
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, to respect the right of the 
peoples of all countries to choose on their own their own path 
of development, and to promote equal and mutually beneficial 
international economic cooperation and trade exchanges. 
  Li Peng said: China adheres to the policy of maintaining 
neighborly and friendly relations with its neighbors and of 
developing friendly and cooperative relations with them. This 
policy has played an increasingly important role in reinforcing 
and developing the good environments around the country. 
China's relations with the four Central Asian nations, 
Mongolia, and other Asian countries fully attest this. 
  Li Peng expressed his hope that the CPAFWFC will attune its 
work to the new situation. He said: All comrades engaging in 
people-to-people diplomatic work should take advantage of the 
current favorable international situation to make more friends 
in order to create a new situation in promoting people-to-people 
friendship. They should be familiar with the domestic situation 
and situations outside the country, should have a good 
understanding of the country's foreign policy, and should study 
harder to further improve themselves. They should further unite 
themselves, cooperate with each other, and truly work as veteran 
comrades long engaged in promoting people-to-people friendship. 
I hope they will make new contributions to promoting 
people-to-people friendship in the new period. 
  Concluding his speech, Li Peng said that he hoped all 
comrades attending the meeting, under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and under the leadership of the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core, will strive for 
new development and progress to bring about more lasting peace 
and friendship for China and the world, which will soon enter 
the 21st century. 
  Li Lanqing, Wang Guangying, Luo Gan, and other comrades 
attended the meeting.

  Yang Jianchang, spokesman of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, 
said here today that the government has decided to hold a 
national conference next week to work out a social security 
system development program, and improve grassroots political 
power construction for the next five years. 
  The meeting, which is scheduled for May 12-16, will also try 
to find solutions for outstanding problems on civil affairs, 
cropping out as China is moving toward a market economy. 
  One of the problems is a lack of relief fund to help the 
victims of natural calamities, the poor, and childless old 
people who cannot support themselves. 
  Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering said that normally the 
victims of natural calamities number 200 million in China a year. 
  During the past five years, China has for the first time 
since 1949 encouraged individuals and institutions at home and 
abroad to provide donations or aid for the victims, the poor and 
other people that need help. 
  Meanwhile, in addition to local governments' aid, the 
central 
government has allocated a total amount of 6.4 billion yuan and 
8.7 billion kg of grain for victims of serious natural disasters. 
  Together with 2.35 billion yuan donated by people at home 
and 
overseas, about 200 million victims received disaster relief, 
the spokesman said. 
  The ministry also has "villagers' autonomy" started in 58 
demonstration counties, which was designed to enable the 
villagers to enjoy more freedom, such as the right to select 
heads of their villages through election, to supervise the 
villages' heads and have more say in the villages' affairs. 
  The minister described the grass-root democracy as important 
to the stability of the rural areas, home to about 900 million 
farmers, and social development. 
  Commenting on the reports that China is planning to 
introduce 
"villagers' autonomy" to all the other villages by the year 
2000, the spokesman said it is only a matter under consideration.

and telecommunications: "Build Nationwide Economic Information 
Network, Improve Information Service for the National Economy"] 
  [Text] 1. Building a nationwide economic information 
network is an objective requirement that must be fulfilled as 
China is establishing its socialist market economy, and it is 
also a natural outcome of the development of modern 
telecommunication and computer technology. 
  The gradual establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure has generated an increasingly urgent demand for the 
processing, handling, transmission, and exchange of economic 
information. On the one hand, the socialist market economic 
structure demands that all kinds of commodity markets and 
production element markets be vigorously developed and that 
enterprises plunge into the market. While the market needs to 
operate in light of updated and reliable information, 
enterprises also count on quick and accurate information sources 
for survival and development amid market competition. The 
so-called invigoration of markets means invigorating the 
circulation of material, financial, and human resources and 
achieving a rational combination of production elements. And to 
invigorate the circulation of material, financial, and human 
resources, one depends on rapid and highly efficient circulation 
of information. Smooth transmission of information can 
substantially increase the rationality and effectiveness of 
circulation of human, financial, and material resources, which 
is of great significance to increasing the efficiency of 
economic operation and the labor productivity of the whole 
community. On the other hand, to establish a socialist market 
economic structure, the state must exercise strong macroeconomic 
regulation and control. In this connection, the state organ in 
charge of economic management must have timely and accurate 
information about conditions of economic operation across the 
country. If it is poorly informed of market operation 
condition, and if it exercises macroeconomic regulation and 
control in light of lopsided, outdated, or even wrong 
information, trouble will arise. Thus it can be seen that to 
run a socialist market economy one must depend first on a sound 
legal system and second on a quick and efficient economic 
information network. 
  The progress of modern electronics and telecommunications 
technology serves as a powerful technological impetus to 
establishing an economic information network and speeding up the 
process of economic information transmission. The integration 
of telecommunications and computers has greatly increased the 
practical value of information, expanded the range of 
applications of information processing, and given rise to a 
series of modern telecommunications and information services 
modes, such as long-range data processing, on-line data base 
indexing, electronic data exchanges, electronic mailbox, and 
video imaging. This technological progress has offered all 
fields, especially industrial and commercial enterprises, an 
opportunity to reform their production management mode and 
increase their labor productivity and competitive power by 
applying modern telecommunications means. At the same time, it 
has also opened up a market full of vitality. The business of 
telecommunications as a trade is no longer confined to basic 
telecommunication services alone, such as telephones and the 
telegraph, with interpersonal telecommunications as their 
principal feature, but has been extended to high-level 
telecommunication services which include man-machine and 
computer telecommunications. 
  To cope with specific circumstances in China, the Chinese 
Government has established the task of creating a nationwide 
economic information network. This is an important policy 
decision to speed up establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure, expedite the process of economic information 
transmission, and narrow the gap between our country and 
developed countries. Our country's economic information network 
is composed of information resource and communication networks. 
The information resource network denotes all the information 
banks and information application systems established by all the 
related economic information suppliers and users, while the 
information communication network links together all information 
resources and application systems through the development of 
network communication platforms [wang lu tong xin ping tai 4986 
6424 6639 0207 1627 0669] on the basis of public 
telecommunication networks of the state. Different types of 
information application systems will also be developed in the 
future to suit the needs of various economic sectors. The 
presentation and implementation of the task of building a 
nationwide economic information network will remarkably advance 
the process of economic information transmission in our country, 
therefore it is of far-reaching historical significance to 
economic development and social progress in our country. 
  2. China's state-run public telecommunication network, 
growing at a high speed over the past 10 years or more, has 
prepared a basic network for the establishment of economic 
information communication network. 
  After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, especially over the past 10 years, China has speeded 
up the pace of development of telecommunication services. The 
growth rate of the country's telecommunication service capacity 
outdid the economic growth rate for the first time in 1985, and 
the telecommunications sector has kept on growing faster and 
faster since then. Now in the Eighth Five-Year Plan, the growth 
of telecommunication services further accelerates. In 1992 and 
1993 alone, the net increase in telephone exchanges was 6.83 
million lines, the net increase in long-distance call circuits 
was 121,000, and the operation capacity increased by 40.4 and 
49.5 percent in these two sectors respectively. 
  As 22 optical fiber trunk lines, 20 digital microwave trunk 
lines, and 20 large- and medium-sized satellite 
telecommunication ground stations are scheduled to be put into 
operation during the eight five-year plan, a large-capacity 
digital transmission trunk line network linking all the cities 
at and above provincial capital level in this country will 
initially take shape in the next two years. During the ninth 
five-year plan, the system capacity and coverage area will 
continue to expand, and a nationwide large-capacity digital 
transmission trunk line network mainly consisting of optical 
fibers will basically be built. 
  While the optical fiber digital network was developing 
rapidly, phase one of the nationwide bundled [fan zu 0433 4809] 
public exchange data network (CHINAPAC) extension project was 
completed in September 1993. Now the network covers 267 cities, 
including all the cities at and above the provincial capital 
level, linked with 20,000 terminals each operating at a 
transmission speed of 65 kilobits per second. Inter-transmitter 
repeat circuits [jie dian ji jian de zhong ji dian lu 4634 7820 
2623 7035 4104 0022 4949 7193 6424] are deployed according to 
operational capacity, and so far more than 100 circuits have 
been installed. Now 18 domestic information system group 
subscribers have signed contracts, thus being linked up with 
this network, and starting rendering data telecommunication 
services. And cross-network link has also been established 
between this network and 37 bundled exchange networks of 20 
foreign countries. 
  Phase one of the nationwide high-speed digital data trunk 
network (DDN) [quan guo gao su shu zi shu ju gu gan wang 0356 
0948 7559 6643 2422 1316 2422 2207 7539 1626 4986], which is to 
link up 21 provinces and municipalities, will be put into 
operation by July this year. The main use of this network is to 
provide all information systems with permanent or semi-permanent 
special digital circuits operating at different speeds. Phase 
one of this project consists of 776 circuits operating at the 
high speed of 2 megabits per second and 2,600 circuits operating 
at a lower speed. Meanwhile, mobile telecommunication services 
have also been developing very quickly in our country. On the 
eastern and southern coast and in some central provinces, 
cellular mobile phone networks have covered all cities and 
counties. Now there are 700,000 mobile phone subscribers, and a 
nationwide cross-network link is being established. With some 7 
million radio telephone paging subscribers, China has now become 
one of the countries with the most telephone pagers. After more 
than 10 years' investment, the country's public 
telecommunication networks have developed substantially either 
in scale and capacity or in terms of technical standards. This 
is an important achievement as a result of the state's 
industrial policy adjustment, which has not only eased the 
shortage of such basic information transmission facilities as 
telephone, telegraph, and facsimile, but also laid down a 
foundation for the development of a nationwide economic 
information network. 
  3. The building of the nationwide economic information 
network requires close cooperation by all sectors concerned, and 
the integration of telecommunications, electronic computer 
technology, and information applications. 
  The building of a nationwide economic information network is 
a social system engineering project which involves different 
sectors. This network is built on the basis of the existing 
national telecommunication network and will capitalize on almost 
all modern telecommunications technology, including high-speed 
transmission, wide-band exchanges, network management, and 
transmission monitoring and control. It will use a large 
quantity of products of the modern electronics industry, as well 
as computers and related software technology. It demands a 
thorough understanding of the application environment and of 
operational requirements on the information system. And it also 
requires highly standardized telecommunication procedures, 
technical standards, and information formats. All these can 
only be achieved through close cooperation among the 
telecommunication sector, electronics industry, and information 
system applications sector. On the one hand, we must arrange 
for an appropriate division of labor, make the best use of 
existing technical conditions and material resources, and avoid 
duplicate efforts. On the other hand, we must arrange for 
different sectors to complement each other, make up each other's 
deficiencies, work together to solve key problems, and strive to 
build up a nationwide economic information network as soon as 
possible. 
  The postal and telecommunication service sector is 
responsible for building the infrastructure of the country's 
telecommunication networks and providing telecommunication 
services to all economic sectors. It must be eager to meet the 
country's urgent needs, and closely cooperate with all 
departments concerned to speed up the building of the nationwide 
economic information network. We are now still far from 
fulfilling the target of supplying basic telephone services 
across the country, yet we are facing an increasingly urgent 
demand for economic information telecommunication services in 
the wake of the establishment of a market economic structure. 
Such a circumstance has posed a severe challenge and an 
opportunity for development as well. Therefore, we must proceed 
from market demand and vigorously intensify data 
telecommunications as well as information system 
telecommunications that are geared to the needs of major 
subscribers, while making further efforts to extensively provide 
general telephone services. We must give comprehensive 
consideration to the need for a nationwide economic information 
telecommunication network and different economic sectors' 
demands for information telecommunication services, properly map 
out a telecommunication service development plan, further step 
up the construction of high-capacity digital trunk line 
transmission networks mainly built with optical fiber cables, 
speed up the building of public telephone networks, bundled 
public exchange networks, digital data networks, and mobile 
telecommunication networks, to provide a highly efficient 
high-capacity information transmission channel and a reliable 
telecommunication platform in support of the "Gold Bridge" [jin 
qiao 6855 2890], "Golden Gate" [jin guan 6855 0595], "Golden 
Card" [jin ka 6855 0595], and various other information 
processing systems.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Curtailing Farm Price Rises Urged"] </F>
  [Text] The State Administration for Commodities Prices is 
urging its provincial branches to slow the spiralling prices of 
farm products. 
  The administration has issued a circular asking its branches 
to consider various maximum price increases for major 
agricultural products. 
  Administration officials cautioned that retailers should not 
violate the administration's ceilings for price rises since the 
limits already take into account retailers' costs, such as taxes 
and transportation, and profit margins. 
  Domestic prices of edible oil, cotton and chemical 
fertilizer 
have been increasing by big margins, according to the Ministry 
of Internal Trade. 
  The ministry's figures show the average price of soya-bean 
oil, peanut oil and rapeseed oil jumped 43.2 per cent to 7,014 
yuan ($806.20) a ton from November to last month the off-season 
in the year-round agricultural production cycle. 
  Last month the administration's Harbin branch in 
Heilongjiang 
forged ahead of other provincial-level branches to hold down 
local prices of edible oil by setting the maximum increases at 
7.40 yuan ($0.85) per kilogram. 
  Cotton prices, too, are spiralling because of a severe 
shortage of supply. In mid-April, a ton of 21-count yarn 
fetched an average 24,000 yuan ($2,758.60), up 2,000 yuan ($230) 
from the beginning of 1993. 
  Because of the soaring costs, most of the country's 
cotton-spinning factories are on the verge of suspending 
production. 
  The situation is worst in Sichuan Province, where at least a 
third of all cotton-spinning factories have already stopped 
production because of the cotton shortage. 
  Prices are also on the rise for chemical fertilizer. 
Analysts blame the rocketing costs of production materials and 
imports for the 11.9 per cent jump since last year in the 
average price for imported and domestically made carbamide. The 
price now stands at 1,240 yuan ($142) a ton.

  [Text] Although the world's first copyright law was 
published in Britain nearly 300 years ago, it was only 1991 that 
a copyright law came into force in China. However, as CRI's 
(Guang Juanjuan) found out, the legal steps China has taken to 
protect intellectual property rights, including copyrights, are 
gaining world recognition. A lawsuit brought by the famous 
U.S.-based Walt Disney company has once again put China's 
Copyright Law under the spotlight. (Yuan Fang) has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [(Yuan)] In January of this year, the 
U.S.-based Walt Disney company filed a lawsuit in Beijing 
Intermediate People's Court. It was against two local 
publishing houses and one distribution department for allegedly 
publishing, distribution, and selling the company's picture 
albums without its permission. The three defendants are Beijing 
Children's Publishing House, Beijing Publishing House, and the 
Beijing Distribution Department of Xinhua Bookstore. (Wang 
Yadong) from the (Jinghe) Law Office is one of the two defense 
counsels for the defendants. He explained why the lawsuit has 
aroused great attention both at home and abroad. 
  [(Wang), in Mandarin fading into English report by [(Yuan)] 
He says the most obvious point is in the past, U.S.-based 
companies seldom resorted to Chinese laws for legal protection 
if they found their copyright was violated. And the current 
lawsuit means foreign companies have now recognized the 
legislative procedures of China's copyright law are more in 
compliance with international norms and the law itself has been 
improved. 
  China began to draft its copyright law in March 1979. After 
10 years of hard work, the country's first copyright law came 
into effect on 1 June 1991. And at the same time, the Detailed 
Regulations for the Implementation of the Copyright Law and the 
Regulations on the Protection of Copyright of Computer Software 
were also passed. Therefore, China has completed the three 
principal lawmaking requirements in the field of copyright 
protection. (Wang Yadong) says as a lawyer, he regards business 
lawsuits as a good phenomenon, because it shows the country's 
law system is more complete and reliable than before. 
  (Wang Yadong) says as the international economic and 
cultural 
exchanges develop, disputes over copyrights have also increased. 
These disputes can be solved through legal means. And if the 
alleged violation is proved, the Walt Disney company's rights 
will be protected. He also mentioned the complaints made by 
some Chinese companies and publishing houses, saying their books 
and records have been pirated in places outside the mainland. 
  (Wang Yadong) says that the country has participated [in] 
the 
Bern Convention for Protection of Literary and Artistic Works 
and the International Copyright Act in October of 1992. Chinese 
companies can also look into legal means to protect their rights 
and recover losses. And at this point, he states, the Disney 
lawsuit has created a good opportunity for Chinese law 
departments and institutions to popularize the sense of 
copyright protection among ordinary citizens -- let them know 
how to protect their own copyrights and in the meantime, avoid 
violating others rights.

  [Text] Nanjing, May 8 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangsu 
Province has used more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars from the 
World Bank since the country resumed its legal seat in the bank 
in 1980. 
  The majority of the loans from the World Bank went to 
powering the province's economic growth in sectors including 
agriculture, industry, transport, energy and education. 
  The province now has over 20 such projects funded by the 
World Bank, which have been completed or are under construction. 
  Of more than one billion yuan of the total investment the 
province put into water control projects, over 100 million U.S. 
dollars -- or 870 million yuan worth -- came from the World Bank. 
  So far, a group of water conservation projects has gone into 
operation and brought about good economic returns for the local 
people. 
  Construction of another giant irrigation project backed by 
the World Bank is also well on its way. When completed in 1996, 
it will benefit nearly four cities and 24 counties in the 
province, with an increase in grain output estimated at one 
million tons yearly. 
  In an effort to use the waste land and waters along the 
coastline, several aquatic breeding zones with high production 
of shrimp and prawns have been built with loans from the World 
Bank. 
  To support the nationwide "spark plan" launched in 1991, the 
province used 65 million U.S. dollars in loans to bolster the 
technological development of its township enterprises, 
collectively- owned firms and other economic group companies. 
  To date, 47 projects in this sector have been authorized by 
the World Bank, an increase in annual output value expected to 
reach 2.5 billion yuan. 
  The World Bank also financed the construction of the 
province's infrastructural projects. A highway expansion 
project leading from the provincial capital Nanjing to Shanghai 
opened to traffic ahead of schedule thanks to timely funds 
provided by the World Bank. 
  To ease the transport "bottleneck", loans from the World 
Bank 
were also used to tackle the "Grand Canal" in southern Jiangsu 
to make it more navigable. Several bridges and ship lock 
projects have already been completed and put into use.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Fang (0719 2397)] </F>
  [Text] Changchun, 6 Apr (XINHUA) -- The 150,000-sedan 
production line project of the Volkswagen company under the 
First Automobile Group I/E Corporation -- China's largest modern 
sedan manufacturing base -- has entered the final stage of 
construction. The First Automobile Group I/E Corporation 
recently held an oath-taking and mobilization meeting to pledge 
mass effort to complete the project and put it into operation 
before the end of this year. Zou Jiahua, member of the CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council vice 
premier, who was on an inspection tour in Jilin, attended the 
meeting and praised the project's fast progress in construction. 
  The project, the construction of which started in 1991, is a 
major project listed in the state's Eighth Five-Year Plan and is 
currently the largest joint venture in the country's machinery 
industry. For this reason, the party Central Committee and the 
State Council have expressed concern for and paid great 
attention to this project. Requiring an area of 218,000 square 
meters, the project will have internationally first-class 
equipment. When the first phase of the project is completed, 
the production line will turn out 150,000 sedans a year. The 
total investment for this project is 1.26 billion yuan. When 
the second phase of the project is completed, the company will 
be able to turn out 300,000 sedans a year. When the entire 
project is completed, the company will become China's largest 
modern sedan manufacturing base turning out Jetta and Golf 
sedans. After three years of hard work by 30 domestic and 
foreign designing and construction units which carried out 
design construction, installation, and production debugging 
simultaneously, about 80 percent of the planned total investment 
has been completed. With the arrival of all the ordered 
production equipment, 1,552 sets in total, the installation of 
equipment and the testing of production processes are now in 
full swing. A modern sedan production base with four large 
buildings has taken shape. By the end of last year, the company 
had manufactured more than 20,000 Jetta sedans for sale on the 
market. When the project is completed and put into operation by 
the end of this year, the company's self-sufficiency rate in 
manufacturing [vehicles and their required parts] will reach 40 
percent. 
  To complete the project according to schedule, the 
corporation, with the support of the Jilin provincial party 
committee and the provincial government, organized eight special 
construction groups, with workers of the corporation playing the 
main role, and proposed that "let us work hard for eight months 
to complete the construction of the 150,000-sedan-capacity plant 
and put it into production by the end of this year." To 
strengthen organizational leadership over the project and to 
accelerate its pace of construction, the Jilin provincial party 
committee and the provincial government formed a "decisive 
battle" leading group headed by Governor Gao Yan, and a project 
command, which will ensure the progress and quality of this 
project. 
  Speaking at the mobilization meeting, Zou Jiahua praised the 
rapid progress of the project, saying: While developing the 
production of sedans, the First Automobile Group I/E Corporation 
has completed the remodeling of its major product, medium 
trucks, and it has ensured good quality. It not only has 
secured a stable share of the domestic market for medium trucks 
but also has exported a large number of them. The corporation 
has built a production base capable of manufacturing 60,000 
light-duty vehicles a year, and the advantage of large-scale 
operations is beginning to yield results. Its spectacular 
achievements in as short a period as several years are the 
results of implementing the party's line of reform and opening 
to the outside world under the care of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council and under the direct leadership 
and support of the Jilin provincial party committee and 
provincial government, and these are also due to the concerted 
efforts made by the corporation's workers and staff members. On 
behalf of the State Council, Zou Jiahua gave his regards to the 
100,000 workers and staff members of the corporation who are 
working hard to develop China's automobile industry, as well as 
to the foreign experts working for the corporation. 
  Zou Jiahua said: The automobile industry is a pillar of 
China's national economy. The First Automobile Group I/E 
Corporation is one of the country's 10 key enterprises of pillar 
industries. Facing intense international market competition, 
the corporation must strengthen itself, enhance its ability to 
participate in international competition, and turn itself into a 
large automobile industry group as soon as possible. The First 
Automobile Group I/E Corporation has already developed in an 
all-round way the production of medium trucks, light cars, and 
sedans. Its most crucial task now is to complete the 
150,000-sedan production base soon. Although the project had a 
late start and involves more difficulties, its construction has 
progressed rapidly. We must complete the major project in two 
years. Zou Jiahua encouraged the builders to make new 
contributions to the development of China's automobile industry.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 9 (CNA) -- A Taiwan delegation, headed 
by Hsu Hui-yu, deputy secretary-general of the Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF), Monday [9 May] met with mainland authorities 
to discuss the March 31 Qiandao Lake incident in which 24 Taiwan 
tourists were robbed and murdered. 
  This was the first time since the crime that SEF officials 
and crime experts were allowed to visit the mainland to probe 
the investigation into the incident, which has frozen 
Taiwan-mainland ties. 
  Hsu said his delegation, comprised of victims' relatives, 
lawyers and forensic scientists, hopes mainland authorities will 
reveal all the facts pertaining to the crime. 
  "Only by doing so can the fragile Taiwan-mainland ties 
return 
to normal," Hsu said. 
  Mainland authorities Monday turned down the Taiwan mission's 
request to see autopsy reports and instead showed them slides 
and taped records about the condition of the bodies. 
  The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
(ARATS), SEF's mainland counterpart, also rejected the mission's 
demand to interview the four men arrested for their alleged 
involvement in the crime. SEF and ARATS are non-official 
conduits for mainland-Taiwan relations. 
  ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Li Yafei, who was among the 
mainland officials meeting with the Taiwan delegation, said 
people in the mainland feel as sad as the people in Taiwan do 
about the accident and the mainland authorities have tried their 
utmost to crack the case. 
  According to a report by the Hong Kong-based WEN WEI PO, Wu 
Liming, a suspect who was charged for complicity in the crime, 
works for the Hangzhou armed police. 
  All 32 passengers and crew aboard a pleasure boat on Qiandao 
Lake in the eastern province of Zhejiang were found burnt to 
death in a small room in the boat on April 1. Luggage and other 
belongings were missing. 
  Although mainland authorities arrested the four suspects and 
said they have tried their best to investigate the accident, Hsu 
said many suspicions surrounding the incident remain. 
  News of the mishap was suppressed at first and then the 
Zhejiang authorities claimed it was an accident. Reporters, 
especially those from Taiwan were barred from the crime scene. 
Relatives of the victims, who were furious over the autopsies 
carried out without their consent, were confined in their 
hotels, and SEF officials were three times refused permission to 
visit the mainland to probe the case. 
  Taiwan has since suspended cultural and educational 
exchanges, banned sightseeing trips, and is reviewing its 
economic policy toward the mainland in protest of the mainland's 
inappropriate handling of the incident.

<F P=106> ["Text" of a speech by Lu Ping, director of the PRC's Hong </F>
Kong and Macao Affairs Office, at a luncheon held in his honor 
sponsored by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the 
Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the Chinese 
Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, the Federation of Hong 
Kong Industries, and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, 
at the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel on 6 May] 
  [Text] In the spring of 1979, when the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office under the State Council of China was just a 
"new-born baby", Deng Xiaoping met in Beijing with Lord 
MacLehose, the then Governor of Hong Kong. Mr. Deng told him in 
earnest that: 
  "Hong Kong is going to be handled by us as a special region 
and a special question. By 1997, no matter how the question of 
Hong Kong is being resolved, its special status will be 
guaranteed. 
  "That is to say, in a considerably long period of time 
between this century and early next century, Hong Kong may 
practise capitalism while we practise socialism. Therefore, 
investors around the world should have nothing to worry about." 
  Then, in 1984, when Mr. Deng met with the then British 
Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, Mr. Deng stressed to Sir 
Geoffrey Howe that: 
  "Hong Kong's prosperity and stability cannot be maintained 
without a guarantee on its continued capitalist system," and, "I 
am confident that the principle of `one country, two systems' is 
workable." 
  Mr. Deng's remarks were by no means casual. What he said was 
the conclusion drawn after considerable investigations and 
studies. 
  Before the negotiation between China and Britain on the 
question of Hong Kong started, Mr. Deng held talks with people 
from Hong Kong and sent people to Hong Kong many times to make 
field studies. 
  A special team was set up to look into this question. I was 
then a member of this team. The team first analysed the factors 
leading to the economic success in Hong Kong and the conditions 
under which they were formed. Then, the team studied whether 
these factors could continue after 1997. The answer was 
positive. 
  A twelve-point policy was formulated. This policy was laid 
down in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and later in the 
Basic Law, and they are the basic policies of the Chinese 
Government regarding Hong Kong. 
  I want to emphasise that these basic policies are not the 
result of the Sino-British talks. They were, as a matter of 
fact, laid on the negotiating table by the Chinese Government 
right from the beginning. 
<H5>  The Reason </H5>
  Now, let me talk about why China decided to adopt the 
principle of `one country, two systems' to settle the question 
of Hong Kong: 
  -- First, it is the best and the only solution for 
maintaining the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. To look 
for a solution, we took into consideration the historical factor 
as well as the current status quo of Hong Kong. The solution 
will not only have to be acceptable to China, but also to Hong 
Kong and to the British side as well. There should be as little 
changes and disturbances as possible in 1997. 
  -- Second it is good for the country as a whole. For the 
modernisations to succeed, we need a bridge to carry us to the 
Western world, and for the Western world to come to the China 
market. Hong Kong has been playing this role all along, and 
China wants it to continue to do so by retaining its 
capitalistic characteristic. We believe that a socialist 
mainland and a capitalist Hong Kong can co-exist in harmony in 
such a way that they can supplement each other instead of 
confronting each other. 
  The mainland can contribute to Hong Kong its huge market, 
abundant human resources and ample supply of raw materials. 
Hong Kong can contribute to the mainland its advanced 
technology and management skills, its wide contacts with the 
Western world as well as its strong financial market. 
  Cities like Shanghai can never take the place of Hong Kong 
because no matter how developed Shanghai becomes, it will remain 
socialist. Shanghai will serve the country as a socialist 
metropolis, while Hong Kong will play a different role in its 
capacity as a capitalist special administrative region. 
  -- Third, it is a big move in the course of reunification of 
China because by offering Hong Kong as a blue print to the 
settlement of the questions of Macao and Taiwan, China sets an 
example to the world that it can settle disputes in a peaceful 
way through mutual accommodation. 
  Therefore, the 'one country, two systems' principle is by no 
means a transient or an offhand policy, nor is it a manoeuvre. 
It is truly China's long term policy. 
<H5>  No Change </H5>
  Some may worry that someday China's policy might change. My 
answer is: "No matter what happens, the principle of `one 
country, two systems' will not change for at least 50 years, 
because it is a correct policy, it is good for Hong Kong, good 
for the country and good for the rest of the world. It is also 
acceptable to all. [no closing quotation marks as published] 
  Why would China want to change it? It is the responsibility 
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office to see that the 
principle of 'one country, two systems' as well as all the basic 
policies laid down in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law 
are being fully carried out. 
  The principle of `one country, two systems' is embodied in 
all the articles of the Basic Law, which was adopted by the 
National People's Congress and has become a national law. It 
has to be observed not only by Hong Kong but also by the rest of 
China for matters relative to Hong Kong. 
  It took four years and eight months to work out the Basic 
Law. As the Chinese saying goes: "One word is worth a thousand 
pieces of gold." The Basic Law is worth much more than that. 
  If we are not serious in carrying out the principle of `one 
country, two systems', why on earth should we waste such a lot 
of time, money and energy to put it into law? I wish to repeat 
that the principle of `one country, two systems' is guaranteed 
by law. 
  I foresee that the principle of `one country, two systems' 
will not change not only within 50 years, but much longer. The 
obvious reason is that we are still in the primary stage of 
socialism. We need hundreds of years to build China into a 
strong socialist state. 
  In this whole course of building socialism Hong Kong will 
continue to play its important role as a bridge between China 
and the Western world. 
<H5>  Two Aspects </H5>
  Of course, by `one country, two systems' we mean that the 
main body of the country practises socialism, which is the 
fundamental system of China, while as a supplement to the 
socialist state, Hong Kong continues to practise capitalism. 
  Therefore, when we say there will be no change in the 
principle of `one country, two systems', there are actually two 
aspects: The capitalist system of Hong Kong will remain 
unchanged, but the fundamental socialist system of the country 
will also not change, otherwise it will be one country, one 
system', instead of 'one country, two systems'. 
  There are some who believe that only when China turns 
capitalist that Hong Kong's capitalism can be guaranteed. This 
is an entirely wrong concept. 
  I want to ask, if in case (which is an impossible 
supposition) China turns capitalist as some people wishfully 
think, where will Hong Kong stand? Can Hong Kong continue to 
play its role as a bridge, which contributes as a major factor 
to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability? 
  Chinese leaders are determined to build a strong socialist 
China. Any movement or action to change this direction may cause 
chaos and disruption to the Chinese economy. 
  Hence, any foreign government or Hong Kong people trying to 
exert pressure on the Chinese Government will not succeed. 
China would not want itself to be rampant with chaos. 
  Furthermore, can Hong Kong continue to prosper with a 
turbulent mainland at its back? During the Cultural Revolution, 
which was purely an internal conflict, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai 
to some extent, could still exercise some control over the "Red 
Guards". Back in 1967, it was premier Zhou Enlai who at the very 
last minute stopped the "Gang of Four" sending troops to Hong 
Kong. 
  Do you know that in order to maintain the prosperity and 
stability of Hong Kong, China has been imposing strict 
self-control on the exodus of immigrants to Hong Kong? It has 
been, and still is, the People's Liberation Army, under the 
strict orders of the Central Government, who have been guarding 
the Hong Kong borders and maintaining the stability in Hong Kong. 
  Therefore, in order to maintain the prosperity and stability 
of Hong Kong, it is of vital importance to maintain the 
stability of China, without which, the principle of 'one 
country, two systems' will be built on sand. 
<H5>  Value of Hong Kong </H5>
  I would like to stress that the value of Hong Kong to China 
has been and will be its economic value. Hong Kong has always 
been an economic city, never a political city. If you ask 
anyone in the street, what he or she is most concerned with, I 
bet over 90 percent will say, it's their livelihood. 
  It is precisely on the basis of Hong Kong's economic value 
that China formulates its present policy towards Hong Kong. Of 
course there are always a handful who are so naive to think that 
they can turn Hong Kong into a political city in order to 
influence the mainland in the sense of politics. If that were 
the case, Hong Kong would be of negative value instead of 
positive value to China. This is disastrous for Hong Kong. 
<H5>  Hong Kong People Rule Hong Kong </H5>
  In order to put the principle of `one country, two systems' 
into practice, we have to adopt the policy of letting Hong Kong 
people rule Hong Kong and allowing Hong Kong enjoy a high degree 
of autonomy. To preserve the capitalist system in Hong Kong, we 
need Hong Kong people who are familiar with the capitalist 
operations to manage themselves. 
  As stipulated in the Basic Law, after 1997, Hong Kong will 
enjoy its own administrative, legislative and judicial powers. 
All daily affairs, except those concerning foreign affairs and 
national defence, will be managed by Hong Kong itself. We have 
been repeatedly told by our leaders that Hong Kong shall not be 
dealt with as we did with Shanghai. 
  No department or province will be allowed to interfere in 
the 
internal affairs of the Hong Kong SAR, and this should be made 
known to everybody, starting from now. Therefore, in promoting 
the Basic Law, we should not only promote it in Hong Kong, in 
overseas countries, but also within China. 
  In future, any department when dealing with Hong Kong, must 
abide by the Basic Law, and it is the responsibility of the Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office to see that everything is done in 
this manner. 
  To take the airport question as an example, it is because 
the 
SAR government still does not exist that China is at present 
negotiating with the British side for the benefit of the future 
SAR. If it were after 1997 such an affair would be an internal 
affair of the SAR, and it would be entirely up to you to decide 
what you want. 
  The reason why we set up the Preliminary Working Committee 
is 
mainly to provide an opportunity for Hong Kong people to 
participate in the preparation of the SAR, to provide a solid 
foundation, an optimum starting point for the SAR government, so 
that when the time of July 1, 1997, comes, what Hong Kong people 
have will continue to be an economically prosperous, financially 
sound, socially secured Hong Kong, with everything in order and 
well-prepared. 
  This is a tremendous task, but I and my colleagues all 
regard 
it as an honoured task endowed upon us by the 1.1 billion 
people. That is why I always said to my colleagues we should be 
fully dedicated and consecrated to the success of this lofty 
cause. 
  Before concluding, I would like to reiterate that it is my 
responsibility to see that the principle of `one country, two 
systems' being put into practice, that the Basic Law is fully 
carried out; that Hong Kong will continue to prosper, that Hong 
Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, that `Hong Kong 
People rule Hong Kong' all will be strictly observed. 
  People will continue to enjoy their present way of life; and 
that all of you present here today will be given the chance to 
further Fat Choy [make money].

  [Text]Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Lu Ping, director of the 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council 
delivered here today a speech on the Chinese Government's policy 
towards the Hong Kong issue at a luncheon given in his honor by 
five local influential organizations. In his speech, Lu 
briefed the Hong Kong people on the questions as how the Chinese 
Government's policy of "one country, two systems" was formulated 
and why it shall be implemented in Hong Kong after 1997. He 
reiterated that the Chinese Government's policy of "one country, 
two systems" towards the future Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region will remain unchanged for at least 50 years. Lu 
elaborated on the contents of the policy of "one country, two 
systems". "By `one country, two systems', we mean that the 
main body of the country practices socialism, which is the 
fundamental system of China, while Hong Kong continues to 
practice capitalism, as a supplement to the socialist state," he 
said. Therefore, he continued, "when we say there will be no 
change in the principle of `one country, two systems,' there are 
actually two aspects: the capitalist system of Hong Kong will 
remain unchanged, but the fundamental socialist system of the 
country will also not change." He pointed out that any attempt 
to turn Hong Kong from an economic city into a political city in 
order to influence the mainland in the sense of politics is 
disastrous for Hong Kong. "The value of Hong Kong to China has 
been and will be its economic value," he said. In the last 
part of his speech, Lu reassured that the Chinese Government's 
policy of letting the Hong Kong people rule Hong Kong and 
allowing Hong Kong to enjoy a high degree Of autonomy shall be 
adopted in order to put the principle of "one country, two 
systems" into practice. He expressed his firm belief that Hong 
Kong will remain prosperous with the practice of the "one 
country, two systems" policy and the fully implementation of the 
basic law. The luncheon was jointly held by the American 
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, the Chinese General Chamber of 
Commerce in Hong Kong, the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of 
Hong Kong, the Federation of Hong Kong Industries and the Hong 
Kong General Chamber of Commerce. Lu Ping arrived here on May 
1 to attend a meeting of the preliminary working committee for 
the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, the first of its kind ever held in Hong 
Kong.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (AFP) -- China on Tuesday made an 
official claim of sovereignty over the Blue Dragon oil field 
being prospected by Vietnam, stepping up the territorial dispute 
in the South China Sea. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
said the zone on the Vietnamese continental shelf should be 
transferred to the disputed Spratly island chain, adding that an 
exploration contract Vietnam has signed with the Mobil oil 
company was "illegal." 
  "The Blue Dragon sea area belongs to the adjacent waters of 
the Nansha islands," he said, using the Chinese name for the 
Spratlys -- claimed in whole or in part by Vietnam, China, 
Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan and the Philippines. His statement was 
the clearest claim of sovereignty over this region yet made by 
the Chinese. They have not made any protests over the search 
for oil in the Great Bear (Dai Hung) field being carried out by 
several companies for the Vietnamese government. The state-run 
PetroVietnam oil company is working with Mobil on exploring the 
Blue Dragon (Than Long) field, which the Vietnamese government 
claims is not part of the Spratlys. 
  China's latest claim will further complicate the 
international bargaining for control of the archipelago. The 
hundreds of isles, atolls and sea rocks in the Spratlys are in 
one of the busiest sea lanes in the world. All vessels going 
from Japan to the Middle East and Europe pass by. 
  But the enormous riches waiting to be exploited under the 
seabed are at the centre of growing diplomatic sabre rattling. 
Vietnam, which has a presence on around 20 of the atolls, last 
week launched a veiled warning about Beijing's intentions in the 
South China Sea. The government called for measures to ease 
tensions and "avoid complicating the situation and without 
resorting to force or threats of force." A diplomat in Beijing 
said "the Chinese have never hidden their ambitions in the 
region and now they are pushing even further to keep Vietnam out 
of what they consider to be a `Chinese lake.'" 
  The Chinese have given exploration rights in a 
25,000-kilometre (10,000-square mile) zone west of the Spratlys 
to a U.S. firm, Crestone Energy Corp. The zone is only 250 
kilometres (160 miles) from the Vietnamese coast, but Crestone 
say they have been promised Chinese naval protection. Hanoi has 
in turn claimed that the Crestone deal is illegal because the 
zone is on the Vietnamese continental shelf. "Beijing seems to 
be attempting to set a frontier that Hanoi can only cross at the 
risk of a naval clash like in 1988," said the diplomat. Three 
Vietnamese vessels were sunk and 76 sailors killed during a 
brief clash with the Chinese navy in 1988. 
  Though Sino-Vietnamese relations were normalised in 1991, 
their territorial dispute remains outstanding. China has 
strengthened its presence in the South China Sea and has 
launched a modernisation programme aimed at making its navy one 
of the world's most powerful by the next century. The air force 
now has Russian Su-27 long-range bombers and are building an air 
base on the Paracels islands -- another South China Sea 
archipelago claimed by China and Vietnam. Vietnam's navy was not 
strong enough to dispute the 1988 conflict and according to 
military experts has weakened further since.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (AFP)--China's ambition to gain 
readmission to the GATT by year's end is still far from being 
realised, the world trade body's chief warned here Tuesday, 
stressing that political will alone was no guarantee of 
membership. 
  "I can give no assurance whatsoever that the negotiations 
can 
be concluded by the end of the year," said GATT secretary 
general Peter Sutherland prior to crucial talks with top Chinese 
foreign trade officials that will have a significant bearing on 
the outcome of China's bid for readmission. There are 
considerable difficulties ... and it is quite clear that a great 
deal remains to be done," Sutherland said in an interview with 
AFP. 
  China, which was a founder member of the General Agreement 
of 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) but left after the communists came to 
power in 1949, has made it clear it attaches great political 
significance to being readmitted before the institution is 
replaced by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on January 1. 
  "But there is so much that can be done within a limited time 
frame," Sutherland said. [sentence as received] "Whether we have 
enough time or not remains to be seen." 
  While GATT members are unanimous on the importance of China 
to the WTO, strong reservations persist over its ability to 
conform with requirements on a whole range of trade issues, 
especially the question of trade transparency. 
  "Its trade rules and regulations and their availiability for 
analysis are in dispute and there are those who would say there 
is not an adequate degree of clarity as yet," Sutherland said, 
citing questions over licensing mechanisms, quotas and 
non-tariff trade barriers. There is a sense of a lack of 
understanding that needs to be overcome, and this requires 
pro-active work by China in persuading and explaining. It's not 
merely a question of political will," Sutherland said, adding 
that negotiations between now and the end of the year would 
require "enormous engagement." 
  Sutherland was scheduled to hold a series of high-level 
talks 
Tuesday afternoon with Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi, assistant 
minister Long Yongtu and vice premier in charge of foreign trade 
Li Lanqing.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- The director-general of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Peter Sutherland, 
said here today that China should be part of the world trade 
system rather than outside the system. 
  Sutherland made the remarks in a brief interview with XINHUA 
on his arrival at the Beijing International Airport. 
  The GATT chief, invited by Wu Yi, Chinese minister of 
foreign 
trade and economic cooperation, will meet with Chinese leaders 
to discuss China's resumption of its contracting party status in 
GATT. 
  He said that this particular visit takes on particular 
importance in regard to timing since it immediately follows the 
Marrakech meeting last month, at which the overall documents of 
the Uruguay Round talks were signed. 
  The world is on the eve of the creation of the new trading 
order as a result of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, 
Sutherland said, and he hoped that the new order in terms of the 
world trade organization would come into existence by the 
beginning of next year. 
  The chief said that from the viewpoint of the rest of the 
world, it is the desire that China should be part of the system 
rather than outside it. 
  It has been said that the negotiation process is a difficult 
one which has been pursued for years, but, he said, "we are very 
anxious that the negotiation process should be pursued speedily, 
constructively and with a view to finding solutions to any 
difficulties that may remain." 
  And therefore, it is a matter of some urgency to speed up 
the 
negotiation process. All parties involved in the negotiations 
have to cooperate to find solutions and bring China into the 
world trade organization. 
  China's enormous importance, politically and economically, 
to 
the world is evident, Sutherland said, and China's integration 
into the new world trade system will be helpful to world trade 
development. 
  As it is the first overseas trip he has taken since the 
Marrakech signing of the Uruguay Round, Sutherland said, it 
shows the extreme importance with which the world's largest 
trade body views China's re-entry. 
  Long Yongtu, assistant minister of foreign trade and 
economic 
cooperation, welcomed the chief at the airport. 
  Long said that China attaches much importance to the chief's 
China visit and expects that the visit will help push forward 
the negotiation process on the restoration of China's GATT 
membership. 
  China's development needs the world and the development of 
world trade also needs China, Long said, and China is willing to 
make due contributions to world trade development.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- The 13th United Nations 
Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific opened 
here today. 
  Over 200 delegates from the UN and international 
cartographic 
organizations and cartographic departments of various countries 
are attending the conference. 
  At the opening ceremony, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing 
praised the UN's role in promoting international cartographic 
cooperation and development. 
  The Chinese Government has always encouraged China's 
cartographic departments to strengthen economic and 
technological cooperation with their foreign counterparts, said 
the vice-premier. 
  To date, China's cartographic management departments have 
signed contracts with cartographic organizations in more than 10 
countries and set up technological cooperative relations with 
dozens of countries. Meanwhile, they have actively participated 
in related activities of the United Nations and international 
cartographic organizations, Li said. 
  With a stable political situation and rapid economic 
development, China now is speeding up its reform and opening to 
the outside world, said Li. He hoped the United Nations and 
other countries in the world would support restoration of 
China's status as a signatory state to GATT so as to further 
promote China's economic development.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- China's Minister of 
Justice Xiao Yang said here today that China is aiming to bring 
its law business in line with international practices in a short 
period of time. 
  Addressing the '94 China International Business Law Seminar, 
Xiao pointed out that in the near future, China should develop 
more self- disciplined law offices, loosen the restrictions on 
such offices, and gradually turn them into independent corporate 
bodies. 
  He also called for establishing a new regulatory system, 
under which legal associations can play a major role in legal 
business management, and leave the justice administrative 
departments to conduct macro-control. 
  About 100 experts from China, France, Germany, Italy, the 
United States, Macao and Taiwan attended the two-day seminar. 
  They will exchange opinions on foreign-related tax laws, 
corporate law, investment law, intellectual property law and new 
trends for worldwide legal business.

  [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- China has advised North 
Korea not to change the fuel rods at its Yongbyon reactor 
without International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) supervision, a 
well-informed source here said Tuesday. 
  The Seoul government had asked Beijing to use its influence 
in the matter, the source said, but North Korea's response was 
not known. 
  Chinese Ambassador to Seoul Zhang Tingyan notified South 
Korean Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong that Beijing has 
asked Pyongyang not to replace the fuel rods at its 5-megawatt 
reactor in Yongbyon without IAEA supervision, the source said. 
  North Korea has defied IAEA demands to be present during the 
refueling and to take samples of the spent rods, which could 
help the agency trace Pyongyang's nuclear activities since 1987 
when the reactor is believed to have started operating. 
  The agency has threatened to report North Korea to the UN 
Security Council unless these demands are met. 
  Pyongyang offered May 6 to let the IAEA be present when the 
fuel rods are changed but would not allow the collection of any 
samples that might reveal past operations. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Hong asked the Chinese ambassador to 
use his influence with North Korea about a week ago, the source 
said.

  [Text] China will exercise its veto power should the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] decide on sanctions regarding North 
Korea's nuclear problem. 
  In a meeting with Beijing-based ROK correspondents today [10 
May], a high-ranking PRC official said that China is making 
diplomatic efforts, including behind-the-scenes contacts, so 
that dialogue between North Korea and the United States are 
realized before 15 May, the deadline for allowing inspections of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  This official, however, stressed that the Chinese Government 
position opposes using pressure on North Korea as a method for 
solving the problem. He strongly suggested that China will 
exercise its veto power when the North Korean nuclear problem is 
referred to the UN Security Council.

Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist 
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said here today that 
China's anti-corruption campaign will be carried out during the 
whole process of its reform, opening up and modernization drive. 
  Hu, also a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central

  Extending a welcome to the visitors, Hu said that 
cooperation 
and exchanges in the fields of politics and economy have kept 
expanding between China and Vietnam since the two countries

well as furthering their relations, Hu added. 
  He expressed satisfaction over the contacts and cooperation 
between the two discipline inspection departments and said that 
the Chinese party and government treasure the traditional 
friendship between the two peoples and are willing to make joint

CPC Political Bureau Standing Committee and the Secretariat of 
the CPC Central Committee, said China will unremittingly carry 
out the anticorruption campaign during the entire process of its 
reform, opening up, and modernization drive. He made the remark 
in the Great Hall of the People this afternoon when meeting with 
a delegation led by director Do Quang Thang of the Control 
Commission of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
Vietnam [CPV].

of corruption. 
  Do Quang Thang is also a member of the CPV Political Bureau 
and Secretariat. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Hu 
Jintao extended a welcome to the delegation led by Do Quang 
Thang. 
  Hu Jintao said since the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese 
relations, as well as exchange and cooperation between the two 
in the fields of politics and economics, have kept expanding. 
  He expressed satisfaction over the friendly relations 
established by the CPC and CPV for their discipline inspection 
organs, and said a further constant expansion of exchange 
between the two parties will be beneficial to promoting mutual 
understanding and learning from each other, as well as 
furthering their friendly relations. 
  Hu Jintao said the CPC and the Chinese Government treasure 
the traditional friendship between the two peoples and are 
willing to make joint efforts with Vietnam to consolidate and 
develop bilateral friendly cooperation in every field. 
  At the meeting, Hu Jintao also briefed visitors on the CPC's 
strengthening of party building and discipline inspection, as 
well as China's reform and opening up. 
  Do Quang Thang said the CPV is willing to draw upon the 
CPC's 
experience in party building and economic development, and to 
strengthen and develop the friendly relations between the two 
parties and countries. 
  Also present at the meeting were Hou Zongbin, deputy 
secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection

  [Text] Sydney, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Vice-Chairman 
Tian Jiyun of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) said 
here today that his four-nation South-Pacific trip has achieved 
the purpose of "increasing understanding, getting acquainted 
with friends and promoting cooperation." 
  Tian, who is leading an NPC delegation now on a visit to 
Australia, described his visit to the four South-Pacific nations 
as a "successful, satisfactory and fruitful one." 
  In an interview with the Chinese reporters based in 
Australia 
here today, Tian said there is no fundamental conflict of 
interests between the four countries and China, and on the 
contrary, they share many common interests. 
  "To keep peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, to 
make the pace of each country's development more faster and to 
make the life of their people better" are the common desires of 
China and these countries, Tian stressed. 
  Tian said both Australia and New Zealand believed that "we 
bear the important and historic responsibilities for 
safeguarding peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region." 
  On the prospect for cooperation between China and the four 
nations, Tian said that the economies of both China and the four 
nations have strong complements and the potential is great for 
furthering economic and trade cooperation. 
  He mentioned particularly the considerable potential of 
cooperation between China and both Australia and New Zealand. 
  He cited as an example the husbandry industry of New 
Zealand, 
which he said has unique strong points in improving the 
grassland and the breed of ox and sheep. 
  Tian also talked of the rich resources that Australia 
boasts, 
saying that China has a considerable demand for resources as 
China is striving for achieving its goal of modernization. 
  He stressed that as China is on its way towards 
modernization, "China should not only expand its markets in the 
world, but also find resources markets outside the country." 
  Tian believed that China, while paying attention to the 
markets in Europe, America and Japan, "must attach importance to 
the South-Pacific region." 
  "There is much room for China to manoeuver in expanding 
trade 
and cooperation in the region," he added. 
  Pointing to the importance of parliamentary diplomacy, Tian 
said, "to do a good job in this regard can play a major role in 
increasing friendship and cooperation between China and the 
countries in the world." 
  During his visit to the four nations, Tian met leaders of 
the 
parliaments and governments, had extensive contacts with the 
parliamentarians and exchanged views with the figures from the 
industrial and business circles on furthering bilateral economic 
and trade cooperation. 
  Tian left here for Brisbane this afternoon to continue his 
visit in Australia, the last leg of his four-nation tour.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
has called for the strengthening of friendly contacts between 
China and India with a view to promoting Sino-Indian friendship 
and cooperation. 
  Li expressed the hope at a meeting here today with Arjun 
Singh, Indian minister of human resources development, who has 
been here to preside over the Indian cultural festival which 
opened in the capital today. 
  Li wished the festival a success, saying the festival has 
brought India's ancient and splendid culture to China. The 
festival is itself a direct contribution to enhancing the 
friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples, he said. 
  China and India, both civilized ancient countries and 
bordering each other, have all reasons to be friendly neighbors, 
Li said, adding that in recent years, the relations between the 
two countries have been developing smoothly, featured by 
"positive achievements" in quite a few fields. 
  Some outstanding questions between China and India will 
finally be solved properly so long as both sides cooperate 
sincerely, Li believed. 
  Singh believed that the current Indian cultural festival 
will 
also turn out a success as the Chinese cultural festival held in 
India in 1992. He said that the holding of the two festivals 
was decided by Li Peng and Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha 
Rao in 1991. 
  The minister said the Indian Government will continue its 
efforts to further consolidate and develop the relations between 
the two countries. 
  Present at the meeting were Cultural Minister Liu Zhongde 
and 
Vice Cultural Minister Liu Deyou.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- A grand performance 
staged by three Indian troupes here this evening marked the 
opening of the two-month Indian Culture Festival. 
  The festival is expected to be held in 16 Chinese cities. 
Indian performances, exhibitions and a movie festival will be 
held in cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing and 
Guangzhou. 
  The Indian Government will dispatch seven cultural 
delegations to China to participate in the festival. 
  Among those present at today's opening ceremony were Li 
Tieying, Chinese State Councillor, Buhe, vice-chairman of the 
Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, Liu 
Zhongde, Chinese culture minister, and Arjun Singh, head of the 
culture delegation of the Indian Government and minister of 
human resources development. 
  They also lighted lamps, an Indian version of cutting the 
ribbon, to open the festival. 
  This is the first time for China to sponsor such a 
large-scale foreign culture festival since the founding of the 
country in 1949. 
  The premiers of the two countries decided to exchange 
culture 
festivals when Chinese Premier Li Peng visited India in 1991, 
and the decision was contained in the Sino-Indian Joint 
Communique issued at that time. 
  A 45-day Chinese Culture Festival was successfully held in 
11 
Indian cities in late 1992.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "An Important Event in the History </F>
of Human Civilization in This Century--Warm Congratulations to 
the Success of the First Multiracial General Election in South 
Africa"] 
  [Text] Goods news came from the distant continent of 
Africa and attracted worldwide attention. The results of the 
first multiracial general election in South Africa showed that 
the African National Congress [ANC] of South Africa led by 
Mandela will win a majority of the vote. In South Africa, a 
ANC-led national unity government will be formed. The result of 
the general election showed that the last apartheid system, 
which was also the most inhumane one in the world, has come to 
an end; and a new South Africa with racial equality is born. 
The vast number of black people being oppressed under the 
racist rule in South Africa have stood up today, and they, 
together with white people, have become masters of the country. 
The success of the first multiracial general election in South 
Africa was not only a significant event in the political life of 
the South African people and the African people as a whole, but 
was also an event of great historical significance in, and with 
far-reaching impact on, the history of human civilization in 
this century. The Chinese people always firmly support the just 
struggle of the South African people, and also heartily rejoice 
at the historic victory scored by the South African people. We 
extend warm congratulations to them. 
  In order to achieve today's universal suffrage, the people 
of 
South Africa continued to fight for more than 300 years. In 
particular, after the ANC was founded in 1912, it led the black 
people in the country to carry out prolonged and unremitting 
struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination and to 
fight for South African black people's equal political and 
economic rights. Their struggle drove the racist regime into 
dire straits, made the authorities realize that they could no 
longer maintain racist rule, and forced them to hold peace 
talks. Constitutional talks began in December 1991. The 
multiparty talks, which lasted more than two years and were 
attended by the ANC and more than 20 other political parties, 
underwent innumerous twists and turns and encountered many 
obstacles, because there were different opinions and interest 
conflicts between various parties, and the far-right wing of the 
white people continued to stir up trouble and provoke conflicts. 
However, backed by Mandela and De Klerk, representatives of 
most political parties cherished the spirit of racial 
reconciliation and democratic consultation, continued to make 
joint efforts to remove various difficulties and obstacles, and 
eventually achieved significant results in advancing the process 
of peace and democracy in South Africa. 
  Today's victory won by the people of South Africa is also 
inseparable from extensive assistance and support from other 
African countries and peoples, especially the great assistance 
and sacrifice made by the forefront countries in Southern 
Africa. The Organization of African Unity, the United Nations, 
other international organizations, and the international 
community as a whole have also made positive contributions to 
supporting the struggle of the South African people. Because 
the struggle of the South African people won extensive support 
and assistance from all justice-upholding and peace-loving 
people inside and outside the country, the situation in South 
Africa could develop in an orientation favorable to the people's 
progress. 
  The success of the first whole-people-involved election in 
South Africa does not indicate the end of the South African 
people's struggle. An extremely small number of far-rightists 
among the white people are not willing to see the collapse of 
the racist system, and they will continue to stir up trouble and 
carry out sabotage. The differences among various organizations 
of the black people have not been completely solved. It will be 
hard to eliminate the influence of the long-standing racist rule 
and violent conflicts within a short time. However, people 
believe that the South African people, who have freed themselves 
from the shackles of the apartheid system, will certainly be 
able to overcome difficulties, and continue to advance along the 
course of racial reconciliation and national peace and 
stability. A new South Africa with democracy, equality, peace, 
and prosperity will certainly appear on the continent of Africa.

  [Text] Stockholm, May 9 (XINHUA) -- West European 
governments and business communities should seize the 
opportunity to boost their share of the China market, a visiting 
Chinese leader said here today. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the 
call in a speech to Swedish entrepreneurs and businessmen. 
  According to Li, the two-way trade between China and Western 
Europe topped 29.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. By June 1993, 
China had 2,146 projects using West European funds, with 5.7 
billion U.S. dollars pledged and 2.25 billion dollars utilized. 
  However, Li said, "Western Europe's shares of China's 
commodity and investment markets are not commensurate with its 
real strength." He added that China is a huge market and its 
economy is growing at a pace rarely seen in the world. 
  Therefore, he said, "We hope that West European governments 
and business communities will not miss the opportunity to boost 
their share of the China market." 
  The CPPCC leader said China will accelerate the improvement 
of its investment environment, including the legal framework 
concerning foreign businesses, with a view to effectively 
protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign 
investors. 
  Li expressed the hope that Western Europe will open its 
market wider to China in an effort to seek a mutually beneficial 
cooperation. 
  On Sino-Swedish relationship, Li said, "There is a great 
potential for our economic cooperation and scientific, 
technological and cultural exchanges." 
  Trade between the two countries reached 900 million dollars 
in 1993, marking a 43.7-percent increase over the previous year. 
  According to Li, Swedish investment in China has also made 
remarkable progress. Swedish firms like Ericsson, Atras Copco 
and Volvo have built up a reputation in China. Products of 
Sino-Swedish Pharmaceuticals Corp. and Kanthel Ltd. are selling 
well. 
  Li arrived in Sweden on Friday for a five-day official 
visit.

  [Text] Stockholm, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan and Swedish Foreign 
Minister Margaretha Ugglas expressed the hope today that the 
traditional friendship and mutual cooperation between their 
countries will be strengthened. 
  In their talks, Li spoke highly of the bilateral relations, 
noting that Sweden is the first western country to establish 
diplomatic relations with New China after it was born in 1949 
and the two nations have no outstanding problems to settle. 
  The two countries share many common interests in the 
maintenance of world peace and promotion of common development, 
Li said. 
  Li added that so long as both sides pursue the principles of 
mutual respect, non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs, mutual benefit and equality as well as seeking common 
grounds while reserving differences, the relations between the 
countries will be promoted constantly. 
  Ugglas said in the talks that her country has paid great 
attention to Li's current visit. 
  She said Sweden appreciates the economic and social 
successes 
achieved by China in recent years. 
  The Swedish Government supports broader economic and trade 
cooperation between the two countries, said the foreign minister. 
  Ugglas expressed her belief that Li's visit will boost the 
existing bilateral ties in the political and economic fields. 
  Li arrived in Sweden's second largest city of Gothenburg 
last 
Friday to begin a visit to the Nordic nation, the second leg of 
his current five-European-nation tour, which has already taken 
him to Finland. Li will proceed to Norway, Denmark and Belgium.

  [Text] Warsaw, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Poland and China today 
hailed the further development of military cooperation between 
the two countries. 
  At a meeting here this morning with a senior Chinese 
military 
delegation, Prime Minister Waldeman Pawlak expressed 
satisfaction with the military cooperation between Poland and 
China. 
  Talking about the bilateral relations between the two 
countries, the prime minister said he hoped to further promote 
development of the Polish-Chinese ties during his scheduled 
visit to China this fall. 
  "Poland hopes to establish a partnership with China, 
especially to develop economic cooperation," he said, adding 
that Poland can help bridge exchanges between China and West 
European nations. 
  Zhang Wannian, chief of General Staff of the People's 
Liberation Army of China, who headed the delegation, passed on 
Chinese Premier Li Peng's regards to Pawlak and said that there 
is a common will to develop cooperation between the two armies. 
  "The Chinese Government attaches great importance to these 
military relations," he added. 
  Zhang, who is also a member of the Military Commission of 
the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, also held 
formal talks with his Polish counterpart, General Tadeusz 
Wilecki, here this morning. 
  Briefing each other on each side's domestic situation and 
the 
development of their armed forces, Zhang and Wilecki expressed 
the common hope to further develop friendship between the two 
armies. 
  During the talks, Wilecki pledged that there would be new 
developments in the future in the cooperation between Polish and 
Chinese armed forces. 
  "Poland and China need to cooperate not only in political 
and 
economic fields but also in the military field," he stressed. 
  Zhang added that the Chinese people and its army will always 
maintain and develop their friendship with their Polish 
counterparts in spite of whatever changes may occur in the 
international situation. 
  Meanwhile, Jerzy Milewski, secretary of the Polish State 
Security Committee and first deputy defense minister, also held 
talks with Zhang this afternoon. 
  Speaking on behalf of the defense minister, Milewski said 
the 
ministry plans to keep closer ties with the Chinese armed forces. 
  He hoped to develop bilateral relations with the Chinese 
military and to send personnel to China to learn Chinese. 
  Zhang said there is a broad prospect for the cooperation 
between the two armies and believed that the relations will 
develop smoothly. 
  The Chinese delegation arrived in Poland on May 7 after a 
visit to Romania.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (AFP)--Deng Xiaoping is alive and 
kicking and has become an avid football fan, one of his sons 
said here Tuesday. Deng Pufang again rejected suggestions that 
China's 89-year-old paramount leader was close to death at a 
press conference to support the Far East and South Pacific 
Disabled Games. "I really deeply regret all these rumors. He is 
in very good health. He enjoys the normal life of a retired 
person," said Deng Pufang, president of the Chinese Federation 
for the Disabled. "As the weather becomes warmer and warmer, he 
can go for walks. It is good for his health," the son added. 
  In recent weeks, rumours that Deng Xiaoping is dead or dying 
have swept world financial markets. They have been denied by his 
family and the foreign ministry, but the last time he was seen 
was on television in February he had to be helped to walk. 
  One of his daughter's, Deng Lin, said on April 28 her father 
was resting in Beijing. 
  Deng Xiaoping has always been known to be a keen bridge 
player. But his son said that the Chinese leader was now a keen 
armchair football fan. "As this summer there will be a lot of 
matches like the World Cup, I am sure he will be interested in 
watching," said Deng Pufang. 
  Deng Pufang was himself crippled when attacked during the 
Cultural Revolution, which is why he is now head of the Chinese 
federation for the disabled. The Far East and South Pacific 
Disabled Games will be held in Beijing from September 4 to 
September 10.

<F P=106> [Report: "Deng Ken, Deng Xiaoping's Younger Brother, </F>
Arrives in Hong Kong, Says Deng Xiaoping in Very Good Health"] 
  [Text] Deng Ken, Deng Xiaoping's younger brother, 
yesterday arrived in Hong Kong by invitation to spend several 
days on a private visit. He said he had visited Deng Xiaoping 
recently, and "my brother is in very good health" and "will 
definitely come to Hong Kong in 1997." 
  After arriving in Hong Kong yesterday, Deng Ken met 
reporters 
at his hotel. He was accompanied by his wife Ding Hua. Luo 
Hsu-jui, chairman of the Paliburg Group, and Cheng Chao-ming, 
managing director of Changjiang Power Development (Hong Kong) 
Company Ltd., are hosting the couple this time. 
  Deng Ken said that this was his second visit to Hong Kong, 
and that this time he is coming mainly for "pleasure" and will 
stay for three to five days. He also said that he had recently 
visited Deng Xiaoping who was in very good health. 
  Regarding the question of when Deng Xiaoping will come to 
Hong Kong, Ding Hua said that this is a matter for his own 
discretion, so she could not answer on his behalf. However, she 
said that he will definitely come to Hong Kong in 1997 and that 
they would come too. 
  Their daughter also came to Hong Kong with them this time. 
  Deng Ken's original name was Deng Xianxiu, and he is 86 
years 
old. He joined the CPC in 1937 and once worked as a reporter. 
After the liberation, he served as vice mayor of Chongqing, vice 
mayor of Wuhan, and vice governor of Hubei Province. He retired 
many years ago and now lives in Wuhan. 
  His wife Ding Hua is currently vice chairman and secretary 
of 
Wuhan City People's Association for Friendship with Foreign 
Countries.

<F P=106> [By Josephine Ma in Brussels] </F>
  [Text] Two mainland artists about to fly to Belgium for an 
international arts festival were taken away by police at Beijing 
airport, holding boarding passes and visas. Mou Sen, director 
of Xijuchejian (Garage Theatre), an experimental drama group in 
Beijing, and arts critic Lin Kehuang, were barred from boarding 
the plane last Tuesday even though they had cleared Customs. 
The reasons for the action remain unknown. 
  Other theatre group members were able to leave for Brussels. 
It is understood the two artists were invited as members of the 
official delegation sent by the Ministry of Culture. Both were 
funded by the organiser, the International Arts Festival 
Brussels. 
  More than 80 Chinese artists from the mainland, Taiwan, and 
Hong Kong are now in Brussels for the festival's China 
programme. Mou was to present his group's first piece, File 0, 
and Lin was to give a talk about drama in China. 
  Festival director Frie Leysen vowed to express 
dissatisfaction at the incident. "It is an emotional evening 
but we are also angry. The Chinese authority has no right to 
keep people who ought to be here," Ms Leysen said before the 
first show by Xijuchejian. 
  Despite the absence of the director, File 0 had its premier 
on schedule and won long applause. 
  Also participating in the festival were two non-official 
mainland artists, independent film-makers Zhang Yuan and Wu 
Wenguan. Their works have been banned by the Chinese 
authorities. Cheung Fai, coordinator of the festival's China 
programme, said Zhang and Wu were not on the official mainland 
delegation. 
  Xijuchejian travels to France tomorrow.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (AFP)--China reacted angrily 
Tuesday to suggestions by Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the 
Dalai Lama, that he might hold a referendum on Tibet's future if 
Beijing ignores his moderate approach. "The so-called 
referendum suggested by the Dalai Lama is yet another trick for 
his splitting activities," a foreign ministry spokesman said. 
"The question of holding a referendum on the future of Tibet 
does not exist," he added. 
  The Dalai Lama raised the possibility of a referendum 
earlier 
this week, saying 14 years of talks with the Chinese had made no 
progress. "I may have no choice but to go in for a referendum 
of Tibetans, both inside Tibet and those outside, for them to 
discuss their options," the Nobel peace laureate said. 
  The foreign ministry spokesman reiterated that Tibet was "an 
inalienable part of China" and warned against any action that 
could undermine Chinese sovereignty over the Himalayan region. 
"Any attempt aimed at splitting Tibet from China will meet with 
firm oppostion from the Chinese people, including Tibetans," he 
said. 
  Chinese troops took control of Tibet in 1959.

  [Text] Xiamen, May 10 (XINHUA) -- The Xiamen Taigu 
Aircraft Engineering Co. Ltd., jointly funded by Britain, 
Singapore, Japan and China, signed a contract with Xiamen 
University to set up a special course in plane repair. 
  According to this contract, Xiamen University is to train 
internationally recognized advanced engineering specialists for 
modern business aircraft repair to meet the needs of the company. 
  In recent years, with the increasing demand of advanced 
management personnel and special technical experts, many foreign 
investors have approached Chinese educational institutes for 
training their staff. 
  Along China's coastal areas, schools and the educational 
funds supported by foreign investors are increasing. Many 
universities have cooperated with foreign investors in training 
their staff by various means. Prominent universities like 
Beijing, Qinghua and Fudan Universities are the first choices 
for advanced management personnel training. 
  It is calculated that the expenses in training advanced 
management staff in China is only about one percent of that in 
the United States. 
  At present, among the already operating foreign-funded 
enterprises, eighty percent of their management staff members 
are Chinese. Largely trained with funding from abroad, many 
have been assigned to other affiliations in other countries.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429): "Why Has Corruption Within the CPC Worsened?"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 4 May -- Corruption is one of the biggest 
evils in Mainland China today. Perhaps in order to act on its 
promise to investigate and tackle serious cases, the CPC 
announced on 12 April the final verdict on the sensational and 
unprecedented financial swindle involving the Great Wall 
Company. Shen Daifu, the former president of the Beijing Great 
Wall Electric-Machinery Technology Company, was found guilty of 
corruption and bribery and sentenced to death; Li Xiaoshi, a 
former vice minister of the State Science and Technology 
Commission, was also found guilty of accepting bribes and 
corruption and received a 20-year jail term. That same day, 
RENMIN RIBAO issued an editorial stressing the maintenance of 
being alert to corruption in the long term, indicating the 
authorities' intention to wage another long battle against 
corruption. 
  Informed sources in Beijing revealed that the CPC's 
transformation of the drive against corruption into a long-term 
effort obviously has to do with the fact that corruption is 
becoming increasingly serious and is growing unchecked. There 
have been three onslaughts of corruption among Chinese 
officialdom over the last decade or so, each worse than the 
preceding one. The first occurred around the late 1970's and 
early 1980's on the crest of the first mercantile tide and took 
the form of abuse of power for monetary gain. The second saw 
rampant "official speculation" in the mid-1980's, and the third 
began in 1992 with the entry of power into the factors market 
and power-for-money deals, in which credit, securities, and 
property became "juicy gains" for corrupt officials. 
  Corruption among officials chiefly takes the form of 
overseas 
trips sponsored on public funds, reckless spending and waste, 
graft involving huge amounts of money, increases in the number 
of criminal gangs, consecutive offenses motivated by strong 
greed, and increasingly open and blatant power-for-money deals. 
<H5>  Corruption Within the Party Is in Fact Power Corruption </H5>
  Even worse, some officials have absconded with money 
obtained 
through bribery and the abuse of power to foreign countries to 
live comfortable lives there. Some cadres sold highly 
confidential documents they spirited out of the country for huge 
amounts of money, causing enormous economic losses to the 
country and society and very bad political repercussions. 
  Increasingly rampant corruption became a target for 
criticism 
from all sides at the two sessions of the Eighth National 
People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] as deputies and members aimed at 
corruption with deafening volleys. The authorities responded by 
having Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, and 
Procurator General Zhang Siqing reveal details about 
investigations into corruption cases to the two sessions and 
announcing seven serious cases in hand: 1) the Li Xiaoshi and 
Shen Daifu cases in Beijing mentioned at the beginning of this 
report; 2) cigarette smuggling involving Wang Jianzhi, the 
former party secretary of Rushan City, Shandong Province, Liu 
Qishan, the former commercial bureau chief, and Fan Zhanwu, a 
former CPPCC member in the Weihai City Prevention Bureau; 3) the 
extraordinarily serious bribery and crime case in which five 
bureau chiefs and 10 office heads of the Minjiang Project Bureau 
of the Ministry of Power Industry accepted a 3 million [currency 
not specified] bribe; 4) the extraordinarily serious case of 
corruption, bribery, and misappropriation in which Gui Bingquan, 
grain bureau chief in Changtu County, Tie Lin, Liaoning 
Province, his deputy bureau chief Yang Maoyuan, and 23 others 
accepted a 2.5 million yuan bribe. 5) the case of Guo Zhengmin, 
head of Guizhou Province Public Security Department, accepting a 
100,000-yuan bribe; 6) the bribery case of Chen Zhiwen, of 
Beijing's Changping County Procuratorate; 7) the case of Li 
Kainan, member of the Hubei Higher People's Court Judiciary 
Commission, who accepted bribes. 
  These seven serious cases show that corruption among 
mainland 
party and government officials is in fact power corruption. 
<H5>  Deng and Chen Urged High-level Authorities To Come to Grips </H5>
With Corruption Sources said that worsening power corruption 
prompted the CPC to launch another anticorruption struggle in 
the summer of 1993, which was conducted under the direct command 
of senior CPC statesmen. 
  As soon as the anticorruption struggle began, Deng Xiaoping 
pointed out to the CPC leadership collective of the third 
generation: "There must be a correct estimate of the extent of 
corruption. Some say corruption is spreading Is it that 
serious? In my view, to a considerable extent, this estimate is 
accurate about some departments and areas. If the Communist 
Party can lead reform, it can surely lead the masses to stop 
corruption. The key lies in a firm attitude and a clear stand. 
We must not let others take up the anticorruption banner and 
tasks. The Communist Party must do this job well. A few years 
ago, I said that it was necessary to correctly grab a number of 
corrupt elements and hit them and some big figures hard. Show 
no mercy to them, as long as they have committed a crime, 
however highranking they are -- even cadres at the ministerial 
and provincial levels. Now, let us take a look: Are there 
cadres at the ministerial and provincial levels committing 
crimes? I think there must be. A few decades ago I put forward 
grabbing reform and opening up with one hand and hitting 
economic crime with another. This, like `grabbing with both 
hands' and `two hands equally tough,' was repeatedly brought up 
over the last few years. It seems we did right. We may have to 
persist in this for the next few decades or 100 years. In 
addition, we must also stress that the anticorruption efforts 
must be legislated for. Corrupt phenomena must be tackled with 
the legal system and legal weapons, so that the anticorruption 
effort can rely on law and will persist." 
  Later, Chen Yun and Peng Zhen also said that the Communist 
Party would not be able to do so again if it did not pursue the 
anticorruption struggle now. "Corruption eats into the 
foundations of the party and turns the party against the people. 
When the party is rotten and has no power to solve its 
corruption problem, other people will step forward and overthrow 
it as a corrupt phenomenon. We must be alert to the seriousness 
of this problem. Realistically, it is the biggest threat." 
  Under the prodding of senior CPC statesmen, CPC General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin made a startling speech on 28 February 
this year at the third plenary session of the Central Commission 
for Discipline Inspection on planning for anticorruption work. 
He said: "The problems uncovered by the anticorruption 
struggle are serious. Corruption has spread to many sectors of 
social life, especially to cadres in CPC party and government 
organs. Power abuse, embezzlement, fraud, stealing impounded 
goods, obstruction of justice, bribery, and graft have reached 
alarming proportions. The danger of the party and the country 
being toppled if we are not determined to fight this tough 
battle against corruption, is real enough." He also said: "We 
will be toppled if we do not handle the economy well. 
But--suppose the economy is doing well--we will still be 
toppled if corruption spreads, graft and bribery run amok, and 
the party is divorced from the people." 
<H5>  Unrestrained Power Invariably Leads to Corruption </H5>
  All of this suggests that the high-level CPC authorities and 
senior statesmen are united in their attitude toward the 
anticorruption task and are equally determined. However, 
corruption has continued unabated and has even escalated 
recently in some sectors. Why? 
  A person in Beijing political circles pointed out that this 
has to do with the permanency of ruling status in Mainland China 
assigned to the Communist Party. He said: Such permanency 
gives the Communist Party a superior sense of "being always in a 
ruling position" and prevents it from taking the erosion of its 
ruling position by corruption seriously. And when corruption 
becomes so serious that it finds itself unable to eliminate it 
completely, it starts worrying too much about its ruling status, 
so much so that it would rather cover up the seriousness of 
corruption in order to retain its secure position, and it will 
not allow outside political forces or social groups to question 
or challenge its power and mandate to rule over the corruption 
issue. It refuses outside supervision of any sort and 
forestalls the formation of restraining mechanisms. Power 
without supervision and checks invariably leads to corruption. 
  This person also said: The corruption of power within the 
CPC now has developed from "power-for-money" deals in the 
economic realm to "power-for-power" deals in the organization 
and personnel realms. So-called "power-for-power" deals refer to 
installing one's confidantes in official positions, forming 
cliques, removing outsiders, and turning one's department and 
system into virtual fiefdoms. They are even more harmful than 
"power-for-money" deals. Therefore, if a relatively independent 
supervisory organization is not set up, the struggle against 
corruption can only deal with symptoms and not the underlying 
cause. But if corruption, now the most serious social pollutant 
in Mainland China, cannot be weeded out, the CPC will not be 
immune to the danger of being toppled.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Experts from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted here today that 
China's National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) has 
achieved the standards of usual international practice. 
  Prior to the conclusion of a fortnight visit to China, an 
international regulatory review mission from the IAEA stated 
that the NNSA has achieved these standards in the fields of 
structure, organization and resources, codes and regulations as 
well as in safety review, licensing and commissioning of nuclear 
power plants. 
  In its opinion, the approach taken by the NNSA for its 
development "can be used as a good example for other countries 
developing a new nuclear power program." 
  The seven-member group, led by Annick Carnino, head of the 
safety standards and co-ordination section, IAEA's division of 
nuclear safety, arrived here on April 23 at NNSA's invitation. 
  During the visit, the group had talks with NNSA officials in 
Beijing and visited Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Shenzhen. 
The visit is IAEA's first review of China's regulatory 
practices in a decade, sources here said. 
  Morris Rosen, assistant director general for nuclear safety 
of the IAEA, told XINHUA here today that the invitation for a 
visit itself shows that the Chinese Government is open-minded 
and willing to have international cooperation in the area of 
nuclear safety. 
  The whole array of China's nuclear safety system is 
consistent with international practices, since China has based 
its legislation on NUSS [expansion unknown] safety series 
documents, Rosen said. 
  The set of codes and regulations of the nuclear power plants 
at Qinshan and Guangdong conform with international standards, 
he added. 
  The group advised its Chinese host to strengthen feedback on 
operating experience in nuclear power plants. 
  At a reception here this evening, Huang Qitao, vice-minister 
of the State Science and Technology Commission, expressed his 
thanks for the group's hard work and their recommendations and 
suggestions. 
  "These will help us to summarize past experience and make 
great contributions to the further enhancement of China's 
nuclear safety regulation, ensure safe operation of nuclear 
installations in China and the protection of the public and the 
environment," he said. 
  The Chinese Government pays much attention to nuclear 
safety, 
and "safety first, quality first" is the basic guideline for 
developing nuclear energy, said Huang, who is also NNSA director 
general. 
  "We will continue to work with governmental departments and 
organizations and continue to do our best to strengthen the 
cooperation with international organizations and foreign 
regulatory bodies and to improve nuclear safety regulation in 
China," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Apr (XINHUA) -- At 1040 Beijing time 
today, the U.S. space shuttle Endeavor, carrying an 
image-forming radar, conducted an image-forming flight over the 
North China Experimental Zone. At the same time, an 
aircraft-based synthetic aperture radar, developed by the 
Electronics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS], 
made a synchronized aerial sweeping of the same zone. The China 
project group's work on the "Space Shuttle Image- Forming Radar 
Program", a large international scientific and technological 
cooperation program, had begun in an all-around way. It 
indicated that China has been among the world's advanced ranks 
in aerial radar survey of the Earth's surface. 
  Radar remote sensing is one of the advanced, high 
technologies in the world of the nineties. The image-forming 
radar on the space shuttle has a multi-wave-length, multi-polar, 
and multi-angle image-forming capability. 
  The survey of the Earth's surface by space-shuttle-based 
image-forming radar is a large international scientific and 
technological program sponsored by the United States. Thirteen 
countries, including Germany, Italy, Australia, Canada, Britain, 
France, and Japan, are taking part in the program. It 
represents the most advanced technological level of radar remote 
sensing in the world before the year 2000. It consists of 52 
strictly appraised and carefully selected items. The item that 
China is in charge of is called the "China Scientific Research 
Project of Space-Shuttle-Based Image-Forming Radar," and the 
task is performed by the CAS's Remote-Sensing Application 
Institute, China's first-rate remote sensing research institute 
with an adequate technological force. 
  From the recent space shuttle Endeavor flight, China 
obtained 
46 minutes of image-forming radar data, which is equivalent to 
the total data of 500 sets of encyclopedias. After the space 
shuttle Endeavor lands on 19 April, the China project group will 
process and analyze all the data, including dry sand 
penetrability, global change research, and geological, 
agricultural, forestry, and marine applications. At the same 
time, the group will join American scientists in researching the 
"Death Valley" super-radar experimental zone. The project will 
be completed in three years. 
  Participation in the large international scientific and 
technological cooperation program by the China project group 
will help China's remote sensing techniques converge with those 
of foreign countries. Moreover, application of the advanced 
survey data will actually benefit China in prospecting of 
natural resources and in environmental monitoring. 
  It is reported that the space radar laboratory -- the 
space-shuttle-based image-forming radar -- will be airborne 
again in August this year, and the China project group will 
continue to conduct real-time survey then.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- Two motions on 
amendments to two regulations governing army building have been 
submitted to the Seventh Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC] Standing Committee today for deliberation and 
approval. One is a draft amendment to the Regulations on the 
Military Service of Active-Duty Officers of the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army [PLA], proposed by Premier Li Peng and the 
Central Military Commission chairman Jiang Zemin; and the other 
is a draft amendment to the Regulations on Military Rank of the 
Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army proposed by the 
Central Military Commission chairman Jiang Zemin. 
  The proposal made by Li Peng and Jiang Zemin on amendment of 
the active-duty officer's military service regulations says: 
With the constant progress in reform and construction of the 
country and the army, some new circumstances and new problems 
have emerged with respect to the building of the PLA's officer 
corps. The modernization of the PLA in the new period 
necessitates higher standards for the officer corps. So, some 
articles in the "Regulations" are no longer adequate to meet the 
needs of new circumstances and new tasks, and it is necessary to 
make some amendment, supplement and improvement. 
  The proposal made by Jiang Zemin on amendment of the 
military 
rank regulations says: With further progress in reform and 
construction of the country and the army and with the smooth 
substitution of younger officers for the older ones in PLA's 
officer corps, particularly among high-ranking officers, some 
stipulations in the regulations are no longer in complete 
conformity with the reality of the officer corps, and some 
contradictions and problems happen during the course of their 
implementation. So, an amendment is necessary. 
  At the request of the State Council and the Central Military 
Commission, Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission 
and director of the General Political Department, made an 
explanation on the two proposed draft amendments. On the draft 
amendment to the active-duty officer's military service 
regulations, Yu Yongbo said: The regulations were adopted by the 
Third Session of the Seventh NPC Standing Committee on 5 
September 1988 and were put in force on 1 January 1989. The 
guiding principle for the proposed amendment is based on Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period and 
on relevant instructions of the Party Central Committee and the 
Central Military Commission. It proceeds from the PLA's 
reality, properly draws on the experience of foreign armies and 
our local governments, and aims at making the leading bodies and 
the officer corps become more revolutionary, younger in average 
age, better educated, and professionally more competent. It is 
designed to make the "Regulations" more conducive to maintaining 
a stable officer corps, to arousing enthusiasm among the vast 
number of officers, to the healthy growth of outstanding young 
officers, and to normal substitution of younger officers for the 
older ones in the leading bodies. 
  Yu Yongbo explained questions concerning the power of 
officer's job assignments and removal, procedures for officer's 
job assignments and removal, the age limits for active-duty 
officers on various levels of posts, officer's pay scale, and 
removal of officers from active duty status. 
  On the proposed amendment to the military rank regulations, 
Yu Yongbo said: Since they were put in force on 1 July 1987, 
the regulations have played an important role in perfecting the 
army cadres' work system, arousing enthusiasm among the vast 
number of officers, enhancing the PLA's cohesion capability, and 
promoting the revolutionization, modernization and 
regularization of the PLA. The guiding principle for the 
proposed amendment is based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought 
on army building in the new period, as well as on the realities 
of our country and our army. Aimed at longterm army building, 
the proposed amendment is designed to meet the needs of modern 
army command and management, improve the officer's military rank 
system, specify more clearly officer's responsibility, harmonize 
the command relations, enhance the sense of honor and sense of 
responsibility among officers, arouse their enthusiasm, and 
promote the building of the officer corps in an all-round way. 
  Yu Yongbo also answered questions in connection with the 
proposed amendment. They included questions regarding officer's 
military ranks, the T/O [table of organization] military ranks 
for chairman and vice chairmen of the Central Military 
Commission, the T/O military ranks for various job posts held by 
members of the Central Military Commission, the T/O military 
ranks for various job posts of military, political and logistic 
officers, the T/O military ranks for various job posts held by 
specialized and technical officers, the waiting period for 
promotion from second lieutenant to first lieutenant, and the 
authority to approve promotion of officers in military rank.

"Zhongnanhai's Deep Love--A Record of Party and Government 
Attaching Importance to the Work of Placement of Transferred 
Military Cadres"] 
  [Text] The "second employment" of retired officers--an 
important task which has lasted for nearly half a century 
following the republic's founding. 
  No matter how we write our history and how we plan our 
future, we will not forget that everyone, ranging from leaders 
of the republic to ordinary functionaries, and every unit, 
ranging from senior government and Army organs to placement 
departments at all levels in various localities and Army units, 
have devoted their enthusiasm and energies to enabling millions 
of officers, who have fulfilled the glorious task of defending 
our motherland, to "transfer their battleground" smoothly, so 
that each of them is properly provided for and lives and works 
in peace and contentment. 
  In this account, we, as witnesses of the work, set down a 
true record of the key activities and relevant historical facts 
over the past few years showing how our party and government 
were concerned about and set store by the work of placement of 
demobilized officers. 
  1. As long as you pay a little attention, you will find 
that from 1990 on, senior party and government leaders were 
present and delivered speeches at almost every important 
activity on the work of placement of demobilized Army officers. 
  Officers must retire after a certain number of years of 
service, as is the case in every country of the world. In both 
developed and developing countries, the issue of placement of 
retired officers occupies an important place in state affairs. 
In our country, proper placement of Army officers transferred 
to civilian work is an important system of our party and 
government. 
  The first officer demobilization order following the PRC's 
founding was signed by Chairman Mao Zedong. The first director 
of the central committee for changing jobs and construction was 
Premier Zhou Enlai. The founders of the republic were 
circumspect and farsighted, they devised good strategies, 
elaborated the key principles of placement of demobilized Army 
officers, and drew up a series of placement policies and 
measures so that the work, which affects a great deal of the 
social fabric, was done in an orderly way and step by step with 
a good beginning and solid foundations. 
  Full-scale reconstruction was to be carried out after the 
Cultural Revolution. Comrade Deng Xiaoping, nucleus of the 
second-generation leadership, made historic contributions to the 
resumption and development of the system of placement of 
demobilized Army officers, which had been suspended for a 
decade. Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee, he brought order out of chaos and decisively 
rectified the problem by which 410,000 Army officers were 
mistakenly handled and demobilized from 1969 to 1975. 
  Times change but we are carrying forward the cause pioneered 
by our predecessors and forging ahead into the future. The 
third-generation leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
core, while bearing the great cause of national reform in mind, 
is often concerned about the current situation and the future of 
the work of placement of demobilized Army officers and 
constantly carries forward under the new situation the fine 
tradition of veteran proletarian revolutionaries attaching 
importance to the work of placement of demobilized Army officers. 
  As long as you pay a little attention, you will find that 
from April 1990 on, senior party and government leaders were 
present and delivered speeches at almost every important 
activity on the work of placement of demobilized Army officers. 
The written instructions given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin 
and Premier Li Peng on documents related to placement of 
demobilized officers, which were conscientious and to the point, 
were clearly seen. Last year alone, General Secretary Jiang 
four times gave important instructions on the work of placement 
of demobilized Army officers. 
  In particular, the two scenes in which General Secretary 
Jiang requested local party committees and governments to do 
well the work of placement of demobilized Army officers are 
unforgettable, moving, and inspiring. The first occasion was on 
10 April 1990. The international situation then was turbulent 
and volatile, while our country was confronted with many new 
domestic conditions. Comrades in the Army and those in various 
localities worried about whether or not proper arrangements 
could be made for over 30,000 officers transferred to civilian 
work that year and whether or not the work could be done on 
time. That day, at 1500, General Secretary Jiang, who wore a 
Chinese tunic suit, and other central leading comrades came to 
the assembly hall where the National Work Meeting on Placement 
of Demobilized Army Officers was being held. General Secretary 
Jiang said with deep feeling: With so many years of trials, our 
Army officers are of good quality and have a fine tradition of 
engaging in ideological and political work, and such talents are 
needed to fill various local posts. On the other hand, there 
are still many specialized talents in the People's Liberation 
Army [PLA], and we should try our best to make proper 
arrangements for this group of demobilized officers so that they 
can become the backbone of various trades and professions. I 
request all of you to make concerted efforts to accomplish this 
work. His voice was so sonorous and forceful that it struck 
deep in every comrade's heart like drumbeats. In consequence, 
the work of placement of demobilized officers proceeded very 
smoothly that year. 
  The second occasion was on 19 May 1993. That year, the 
Army implemented the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central 
Military Commission's strategic policy decision of restructuring 
and streamlining the establishment, and nearly 6,000 officers 
were transferred to local civilian work. Likewise, efforts were 
made to start implementing the restructuring of local party and 
government organs and arrangements had to be made for a number 
of redundant personnel. It can be understood how difficult the 
work of placement of demobilized Army officers was. Bearing in 
mind that Army restructuring and streamlining is a major and 
very onerous task which the Army itself must make great efforts 
in and which the party and the state must extend vigorous 
support to, General Secretary Jiang Zemin came to the conference 
hall again and delivered a speech full of enthusiasm at a time 
when the annual National Work Meeting on Placement of 
Demobilized Army Officers was being held: 
  From the day they enlist in the Army, our Army officers work 
very hard for our national defense and defense construction. 
When these comrades are transferred to civilian work, the state 
must make appropriate arrangements for them in a responsible 
manner. Hence, we must further mobilize everyone to support the 
work, because whether or not good arrangements are made for 
these officers will have a great bearing on the stability of our 
society and our Army as well as on our country's overall 
economic construction. Therefore, to put it in a nutshell, I 
request you accomplish the work! Moreover, when you return to 
your units, please report to your party committees the message 
that we request your local party committees at all levels to 
make good arrangements for demobilized Army officers. 
  The audience burst into prolonged thunderous applause, which 
conveyed to General Secretary Jiang the determination and 
confidence of those engaging in the work of transferring Army 
officers to civilian work and which conveyed to the CPC Central 
Committee, the state Council, and the Central Military 
Commission the most sincere tribute and gratitude of officers 
and men. 
  The general secretary's request was transmitted to all 
quarters, just like great waves radiating from a rock. Various 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities took action, 
as did various prefectures, cities, and counties. By the end of 
1993, 60,000 demobilized officers, along with over 17,000 family 
members, were assigned to their respective posts around our 
motherland. 
  2. Our party and government always remember the 
sacrifices and contributions made by demobilized Army officers 
for the cause of socialist construction. 
  Nearly 3 million Army officers have been successively 
transferred to localities since our country was founded more 
than 40 years ago. They are still carrying forward our Army's 
honorable tradition and fighting to their last breath on all 
fronts in our motherland, thus adding a glorious chapter to 
their undisputed contributions to our party and our people. 
Zhao Dongwan, former minister of personnel, once enumerated 
demobilized Army officers' illustrious achievements in the cause 
of socialist construction: 
  During the period of national economic restoration, over 
300,000 Army officers took off their uniforms and turned 
themselves into a large contingent engaging in railway 
construction, irrigation works, forestry, and the petroleum 
industry in our motherland. They also turned themselves into 
building units and troops stationed to open up wasteland. In 
the spring of 1958, 100,000 demobilized officers and men trod 
ice and snow and moved into the great northern wilderness. 
After over 30 years of arduous efforts in pioneering work, they 
built up our country's key commodity grain-producing base on 
land with no sign of human habitation. In the early sixties, 
another group of 130,000 selected outstanding grass-roots Army 
officers were transferred to the commercial front and made 
important contributions to economic development and the 
guarantee of supply. From 1985 to the present, 100,000 
demobilized officers have been assigned to public security, 
judicial, and procuratorial departments and to courts; 180,000 
have been assigned to industrial and commercial, taxation, and 
financial departments; 85,000 have been assigned to key state 
construction projects and newly established and expanded units; 
and 90,000 have been assigned to education, scientific research, 
cultural, and public health departments. Among them, 75,000 
have been elected model and advanced workers by units at and 
above the county level; 5,200 have been elected outstanding 
entrepreneurs; 158,000 have been elected outstanding ideological 
and political workers; and 154,000 have assumed posts at and 
above the county and department levels or the equivalent. We 
can say that the footprints of demobilized Army officers' 
struggles have been left everywhere in our motherland's history 
of starting undertakings and that their painstaking efforts are 
reflected in the achievements scored by various trades and 
professions. 
  Our party and government always remember the sacrifices and 
contributions made by demobilized Army officers for the cause of 
socialist construction. In October 1991, the National Meeting 
on Commending Model Demobilized Army Officers was solemnly 
called with the approval of the State Council and the Central 
Military Commission, and 213 national model demobilized Army 
officers happily gathered in Beijing and were commended by the 
state and the people. This was another grand gathering held 
since our motherland's founding wherein a large number of model 
demobilized Army officers was commended. 
  During the commendation meeting, State Council Premier Li 
Peng spared time to meet model workers. On the afternoon of 22 
October, it was close to 1700 after Comrade Li Peng had 
completed his meeting with the last group of foreign visitors, 
but he did not care about his tiredness and hurried to the 
conference hall. As he walked, he kept saying: "I am sorry to 
make you all wait a long time." He said cordially: First of 
all, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council, I convey to you our heartfelt congratulations on the 
outstanding achievements scored at your respective posts. In 
his speech, which was full of enthusiasm and commendation, 
Premier Li stressed: "Due to the good training they received in 
the Army, demobilized Army officers have a higher political 
quality. They have also mastered a good many skills while 
undergoing the dual-purpose talent training in the Army. The 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council always hold that 
demobilized Army officers are an important force in socialist 
modernization. As proved by practice, demobilized Army officers 
have been playing a very good role on every socialist front." 
He sincerely wished everybody to continue carrying forward our 
fine tradition, to maintain our honor, and to make further new 
contributions. 
  The successful convening of the commendation meeting 
evoked strong repercussions in the Army and in various 
localities and played a very good role in bringing about good 
practice in society of understanding and showing respect for 
demobilized Army officers and extending support to the work of 
placement of demobilized Army officers. 
  Now, on the land of the republic, no matter where they are, 
demobilized Army officers are developing eye-catching 
undertakings; and no matter which profession they are in, 
demobilized Army officers are creating glories of revitalizing 
our motherland. 
  3. Under the condition of developing a socialist market 
economy, should we or should we not uphold the guiding ideology 
of "two services" in the work of placement of demobilized Army 
officers? the central leadership "put it in this way." 
  The guiding ideology of the work of placement of demobilized 
Army officers, which was established by Mao Zedong and Zhou 
Enlai and which we have upheld for several decades, is to "be 
subordinate to the needs of state economic construction and 
defense construction and to merge the two into an integrated 
whole. Should we or should we not uphold it under the condition 
of developing a socialist market economy? 
  On 13 November 1993, after listening to the report made by 
Yu 
Yongbo, director of the PLA's General Political Department, Hu 
Jintao, standing committee member of the central CPC Political 
Bureau and member of the central CPC Secretariat, said to Lu 
Feng, head of the Organization Department under the CPC Central 
Committee, and Minister of Personnel Song Defu, who were 
present: Should the guiding ideology of the work of placement 
of demobilized Army officers be through "one service" or through 
"two services"? In my view, "two services" is still better. 
The work of placement of demobilized Army officers must serve 
economic construction and reform and opening up, but, at the 
same time, it must help consolidate the stability of the Army, 
since without a reliable guarantee of security, we cannot 
achieve success in economic construction. Leading comrades at 
the central level "put it in this way." A comrade engaging in 
the work of placement of demobilized Army officers said with 
deep feeling: "As far as the work of placement of demobilized 
Army officers is concerned, it is as if we are shouldering two 
burdens at the same time, with one end tied to the state and the 
other tied to the Army, and consideration must be given to both!" 
  As far as the task of serving defense construction is 
concerned, making arrangements for demobilized Army officers and 
straightening out the channel for "exporting" Army officers is 
essential to realizing the supersession of old officers by new 
ones, improving the quality of our Army, and enhancing our 
Army's combat strength, because over 90 percent of Army officers 
are faced with the problem of transference to civilian work. 
Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, 
once said that good placement of demobilized Army officers has 
extremely important significance. It is beneficial to make 
arrangements for demobilized Army officers because they also 
possess a number of favorable conditions. Most of them once 
studied in military academies and have a high level of 
education. Officers holding posts in divisions and regiments, 
who once tempered themselves at the grass-roots level, have rich 
working experience and good political quality. After their 
transfer to various localities, some of the Army officers 
originally holding posts in divisions and regiments are still 
young compared with some local cadres, and it is precisely the 
time to bring their abilities into play. Hence, it is really a 
matter of vital and lasting importance to make good arrangements 
for and to make good use of them. As far as the task of 
serving state economic construction is concerned, demobilized 
Army officers are an important source of local cadres and an 
important force in socialist construction of the "two 
civilizations." The fact that group after group of Army 
officers are being transferred to various localities not only 
invigorates the contingent of local cadres but is also 
beneficial to our country's reform, development, and stability. 
As General Secretary Jiang commented, it will not work if none 
of the local cadres has any military knowledge. Some of the 
outstanding Army officers may be overage in the Army, but 
certain arrangements can be made to transfer them to various 
localities. 
  A review of the history of the work of placement of 
demobilized officers can show that our party and government 
always uphold the guiding ideology of making the work of 
placement of demobilized officers serve defense and economic 
construction. It has become the foundation for reaching a 
common understanding between various sectors, the basis for 
formulating policies and stipulations, and the yardstick for 
measuring the results of the placement work. No matter what 
changes the objective situation undergoes, we will steadfastly 
uphold the guiding ideology. 
  4. Our party and government have been, as always, 
making appropriate arrangements for demobilized officers and 
bear responsibility for them to the end, and the state and local 
governments at all levels have invested a great deal of 
manpower, materiel, and financial resources in this respect. 
  There are so many things to consider regarding the work of 
placement of demobilized Army officers, but the ultimate aim is 
to make appropriate arrangements for demobilized Army officers. 
  On the morning of 26 March 1990, General Secretary Jiang 
visited the PLA delegation present at the Third Session of the 
Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] and took part in the 
discussion. Wang Aiwu, deputy from the frontier guards in 
Heilongjiang, reported on the situation of making arrangements 
for demobilized officers, and his remarks attracted the 
attention of General Secretary Jiang, who jotted down notes 
while listening to Wang's speech. During a break in the 
meeting, he asked leaders of the Central Military Commission on 
the spot about the situation concerned. On 10 April, he thought 
about this matter again when receiving delegates to the National 
Work Meeting on the Placement of Demobilized Army Officers. He 
said: Not long ago, I took part in the meeting of the PLA 
delegation present at the NPC session and heard a report on the 
placement of demobilized servicemen, and I do have some ideas. 
Since our country's economy is, after all, not very strong, 
therefore, certain difficulties still remain in defense 
construction and in placement of demobilized servicemen. We 
must conduct some surveys to see how the work can be improved 
under the existing economic strength and conditions. 
  After General Secretary Jiang had made the remarks, the 
CPC Central Committee's Organization Department, the State 
Council's Ministry of Personnel, and the General Political 
Department immediately studied ways to solve the job arrangement 
problem of demobilized officers. In a short span of two months, 
they formulated and issued to lower levels the "Circular on 
Accomplishing the Work of Assigning Demobilized Regimental 
Officers to New Posts," that is, the "Document No. 3" well-known 
to Army officers. The document laid down concrete stipulations 
on jobs assigned to Army officers transferred to various 
localities in light of the duration of their active service and 
the extent of their contributions. That year, a number of 
measures were taken by various localities, including assigning 
Army officers still in active service to civilian posts, 
allowing them to work in localities before they had been 
formally demobilized, and reserving civilian posts for them in 
advance. As a result, 95 percent of over 2,000 officers with 
regimental duties satisfying the job-arrangement conditions were 
assigned to corresponding posts; while the situation of 
arranging jobs for other regimental officers was also markedly 
improved, since the percentage for which corresponding posts 
were arranged increased by 35.8 percent. 
  Leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and of the 
Central Military Commission also set much store by the situation 
in implementing the policy on placement of demobilized Army 
officers. Last year, due to the large number of demobilized 
officers or for other reasons, a small number of localities did 
not implement the policy of arranging jobs for demobilized 
regimental officers. After learning of this situation, General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin instructed leaders of the General 
Political Department to make a report directly to Comrade Hu 
Jintao. On 27 November 1993, Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, wrote comments on materials 
reflecting the problem and instructed relevant departments to 
immediately study ways to solve it. With joint efforts by the 
Army and local authorities, the problem was solved step by step. 
  Our party and government leaders are very much concerned 
about the difficulties faced by officers and men stationed for a 
long time in areas where conditions are hardest, such as the 
border, islands, highlands, and deserts, as well as the 
placement problem after their transfer to civilian posts. The 
leaders have repeatedly instructed departments concerned to 
study and solve the problem by working out relevant policies 
which show the solicitude of our party and government for them. 
The stipulations introduced in April 1990, which concerned 
recruiting and taking care of demobilized officers serving in 
the Army for a long time, occupying senior posts, and making 
great contributions to the Army, were precisely the outcome of 
the guiding ideology. The implementation of these stipulations 
fully embodies our party's principles of appointing people on 
their merits with the focus on concrete achievements in the work 
of placement of demobilized officers, which is a very great 
inspiration to demobilized officers as well as comrades still 
serving in the Army. 
  In recent years, our party and government have been, as 
always, making appropriate arrangements for demobilized officers 
and bearing responsibility for them to the end, and the state 
and local governments at all levels have invested a great deal 
of manpower, materiel, and financial resources in this respect. 
Taking housing as an example, the state, under a tight 
financial situation, has successively increased subsidies for 
building houses three times. Incomplete statistics show that a 
total of 1.3 billion yuan of state subsidies have been granted 
to various localities for building houses for demobilized 
officers. 
  We cannot calculate, in detail, how much labor our society 
has expended on the placement of demobilized officers. We can 
only acclaim the work as a grand social project with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  5. The time for restructuring the work of placement of 
demobilized Army officers is becoming ripe, and the pace of 
reform is gaining momentum. 
  The times are forging ahead and our society is undergoing 
changes. Centering on the goal of establishing a socialist 
market economic system set by the 14th CPC Congress, all trades 
and professions are making more efforts in implementing their 
reforms and accelerating the pace of reform. People are 
particularly concerned about how to adjust the work of placement 
of demobilized Army officers to the reform of the whole country 
and how to introduce new measures of placement. Departments 
concerned cannot, so far, furnish conclusive answers to these 
questions, but we can see from a series of instructions issued 
by leading comrades at the central level that the train of 
thought in reforming the work of placement of demobilized Army 
officers is very clear. 
  As far as the method of assignment is concerned, leading 
comrades at the central level unequivocally point out: 
Mandatory planning must undergo some changes and adapt itself 
to the situation of market economy, but for some of the officers 
who still fail to be assigned to new posts even after two-way 
choices, the state must make arrangements for them. Never can 
the state leave them out and make them fell abandoned by merely 
laying stress on the market economy. 
  As far as work arrangement and living conditions are 
concerned, leading comrades at the central level emphasize: No 
matter how far our reform goes, our ultimate aim is to help 
demobilized officers settle in their proper places and to ensure 
that they can be assigned work commensurate with their 
qualifications and competence. Their pay and fringe benefits 
must be guaranteed. 
  As far as improvement of the quality of demobilized 
officers is concerned, leaders of the Central Military 
Commission point out time and again that we must conscientiously 
implement a series of important instructions on training talents 
capable of serving in the Army and in localities issued by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Early last year, Zhang Zhen, vice 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed when 
inspecting the troops stationed in Fujian: We must strengthen 
officers' on-the-job training and let them learn more scientific 
and cultural knowledge and master certain economic and 
management know-how so that they can adapt themselves to the 
requirements of Army construction and can also meet the needs of 
socialist modernization and have a certain level of competitive 
power after transferring to civilian posts. 
  As far as legal construction is concerned, Vice Chairmen Liu 
and Zhang of the Central Military Commission repeatedly point 
out that we must begin with further establishing and perfecting 
rules and regulations to dispel officers' worries in retirement 
and placement and to gradually perfect the mechanism of 
protection, thus enabling the work of placement of demobilized 
Army officers to develop in a form involving law and system in a 
standardized way. 
  At present, the time for restructuring the work of placement 
of demobilized Army officers is becoming ripe, and the pace of 
reform is gaining momentum. Let us look at the following pieces 
of heartening news: 
  The State Council Work Group for Placement of Demobilized 
Army Officers called a meeting on 2 March 1994, which decided 
that we must pay great attention to drafting the "Interim 
Regulations on the Work of Placement of Demobilized Army 
Officers" and strive to complete it within this year. 
  This year, in order to meet the needs of making state 
talents 
mobile, restrictions on demobilized officers transferred to 
civilian work will be relaxed. Demobilized officers stationed 
in medium-sized and small cities along with their spouses are 
allowed to be assigned to the same areas or nearby localities; 
while some demobilized officers having specialized knowledge are 
allowed to be assigned to other provinces and regions. 
  This year, we will further broaden placement channels and 
perfect assignment methods to better serve personnel units and 
create conditions for demobilized officers' voluntary job 
selection. 
  This year, in order to adapt ourselves to the new situation 
of reforming the Army and local pay system, we will draw up new 
regulations on the method of transforming the pay scale of 
demobilized officers on the principle of not allowing their pay 
and fringe benefits to be lower than those enjoyed by local 
cadres in corresponding grades. 
  Appropriate consideration will be given to demobilized 
officers joining the contingent of state civil servants. For 
demobilized officers at the regimental grade who join the 
contingent of state civil servants, the method of selection and 
transfer will be adopted; whereas for demobilized officers below 
the battalion grade who enter party and government organs and 
take up nonleadership posts below the director grade, only the 
method of recruitment through examination will be tried among 
officers transferred to civilian work within that year. 
  In order to gradually take the path of solving the housing 
problems of demobilized officers through multiple channels and 
forms, the State Council Work Group for the Placement of 
Demobilized Army Officers and other departments concerned have 
resorted to a number of methods on a trial basis in localities 
with adequate conditions, including raising funds for building 
houses in a coordinated manner, assigning them to civilian jobs 
with housing allowances, encouraging them to build their own 
houses while providing government assistance, and selling houses 
to them on preferential terms. 
  All these situations show that as far as the work of 
placement of demobilized Army officers is concerned, the policy 
will become more and more perfect and the path will become 
broader and broader. 
  Our dear comrade-in-arms, the CPC Central Committee, with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, is concerned about demobilized 
officers, who are welcomed by local party committees and 
governments at all levels and the masses and needed by the 
undertaking of socialist construction. There is no need for us 
to worry about their "way out." On the contrary, we must fully 
understand our state's problems, conscientiously submit 
ourselves to the overall situation, and attach importance to our 
people's interests. As long as we live up to our party's and 
our people's ardent expectations, we must definitely be given 
new fields to fully exhibit our talents and strengths on all 
fronts of reform and opening up once we have fulfilled our task 
of defense. 
  As far as the work of placement of demobilized Army officers 
is concerned, an extraordinary decades-long course has been 
traversed, with a good deal of effort made and great 
achievements scored. We may be confronted with many new 
situations and many new problems and have to shoulder heavy 
responsibilities in the days to come. However, we firmly believe 
that the work of placement of demobilized Army officers will 
definitely have a brighter future.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- China is resolved to 
have unions established by the end of 1994 in all foreign-funded 
enterprises already operational in major development zones and 
open cities along the east coast, a union leader told XINHUA 
today. 
  According to Yang Xingfu, vice-chairman of the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), unions are found in less 
than ten percent of the 47,000 foreign-funded enterprises 
already operational, which employ about six million Chinese. 
  "ACFTU is accelerating its work to get them organized in 
unions in view of the growing number of labor disputes in 
foreign-funded enterprises; for now we are concentrating on the 
places where foreign-funded enterprises are concentrated," Yang 
said. 
  In about one year or two, Yang explained, unions should have 
been established in foreign-funded enterprises all over China. 
  "From now on," he continued, "talks on union affairs must 
proceed hand-in-hand with negotiations on any project involving 
foreign investors, and the union should be in operation not 
later than one year after a project starts operating." 
  Yang specified the union task in a foreign-funded 
enterprises 
as one of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the 
employees while co-operating with the investor in the 
development of the enterprise. 
  "There are good examples of investors respecting staff 
rights 
and interests and supporting unions in their work," he said. 
"This invariably results in higher staff morale and better 
profits for the investors." 
  What Yang called "good examples" are mostly furnished by 
large- or medium-sized enterprises which follow international 
standards in management and respect China's labor laws. 
  But problems are "serious" in many others, especially in 
smaller, labor-intensive enterprises. 
  "Foreign employers often force workers to work overtime, pay 
no heed to labor safety regulations and deliberately find fault 
with the workers as an excuse to cut their wages or fine them, 
in violation of China's laws and regulations," he said. 
  "This only does harm to China's efforts to attract foreign 
investment, and eventually to the interests of investors," he 
added. 
  Under China's Constitution and laws on foreign investment, 
he 
said, "Chinese employees have the right to protect their own 
legitimate rights and interests and seek help from ACFTU in 
establishing unions." 
  ACFTU and its local organizations, for their part, "have the 
right to help Chinese workers get organized." 
  ACTFU is now busy working on a set of regulations concerning 
union work in foreign-funded enterprises. 
  In June it will call a meeting to boost the work of 
organizing unions in such enterprises. 
  Meanwhile, ACFTU is "doing its best" to promote the 
publication, as early as possible, of a labor law, a law on 
social security and a law on labor protection. 
  Before that, he said, governments should publish regulations 
on minimum wages, social security and other matters vital to 
workers' rights and interests. 
  "Improved legislation is important to all parties: 
Governments should abide by the law in exercising control over 
foreign-funded enterprises, foreign investors in handling their 
day-to-day management and employees in protecting their own 
rights and interests," the union leader conceded.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (CNS) -- The trend for the exchange 
rate of the renminbi [RMB] is one of the Mainland's main 
concerns. Deputy Director of the State Administration of Foreign 
Exchange Control Mr. Xu Bin said that there had been no dramatic 
fluctuation of the exchange rate of the renminbi since the 
second half of last year and he is optimistic about the 
maintenance of relative stability of the currency because the 
overall economy has since the beginning of this year proceeded 
at a well-coordinated pace. 
  The exchange rate for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar 
has remained at RMB 870 against U.S.$ 100 during the period 
between early this year up until now, Mr. Xu said. The renminbi 
showed a slight gain against the U.S. dollar in recent times, 
representing success in the restructuring of the foreign 
exchange system and unification of the exchange rate of the 
renminbi. Mr. Xu said he was convinced that the present 
exchange rate for the renminbi was reasonable, reflecting the 
level of cost and profit resulting from exports as well as 
endurance capability for imports. The rate also showed supply 
and demand for foreign exchange resulting from the flow of 
capital. 
  Mr. Xu said that the exchange rate of one U.S. dollar 
against 
8.7 yuan was based on the market regulation and the foreign 
exchange control administration played no part in the 
maintenance of the exchange rate nor did other departments play 
a dominant role in maintaining the exchange rate. He was 
convinced that the current rate showed the real market supply 
and demand and considered it the true market exchange rate. 
  The so-called floating exchange rate system under 
administration set out in a statement issued by the People's 
Bank of China, according to Mr. Xu, mainly put the emphasis on 
the formulation of a programme for the foreign exchange market 
and on the ensuring of orderly operation of the market. It will 
in no way disrupt trading in the foreign exchange market. China 
will employ economic means in accordance with law to govern the 
foreign exchange market. 
  It is a must, Mr. Xu said, for enterprises to have analysis 
and projection on the trend of the exchange rate. The rate 
itself is not an independent factor showing the overall level 
and demand for the economy but it is closely related to 
macroeconomic and monetary policy. The exchange rate which has 
remained at the current level for a relative long period 
indicated that it was acceptable to the market. The main policy 
on the exchange rate of the renminbi, Mr. Xu said, was to 
maintain relative stability of the rate of the currency.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Zou Xiangqun (6760 0686 5028), </F>
vice secretary general of the State Planning Commission, by 
staff reporter: "How To Manage Prices Under a Market Economy"] 
  [Text] After more than a decade of reform, the traditional 
price management system is already basically shattered, and the 
framework for a new price management system is gradually being 
shaped. Under these circumstances, is the task of price reform 
already accomplished? Can things be allowed to run their course 
after freeing up prices? With these questions of general 
concern in mind, our staff reporter visited Zou Xiangqun, vice 
secretary general of the State Planning Commission (former 
deputy bureau chief of the State Pricing Bureau). 
<H5>  Freeing Up Prices Does Not Equal Accomplishment of the Task </H5>
of Reform 
  With 15 years of price reform, the highly centralized 
government pricing system in China has been shattered and the 
prices of most commodities are formed by the market. By the end 
of 1992, government-fixed prices only accounted for 5.9 percent 
of the gross retail volume of commodities in society; of the 
gross volume of agricultural produce sold by farmers, 
government-fixed prices accounted for 12.5 percent; and of the 
gross volume of capital goods sold by industrial enterprises, 
government-fixed prices accounted for 18.7 percent. The price 
relationship between many important commodities has been 
fundamentally improved, and the pricing structure is 
continuously becoming more rational. The price scissors between 
industrial and agricultural products has been greatly reduced, 
the situation where the prices of basic industrial products were 
too low has clearly improved, and 95 percent of the domestic 
sale-prices of imported goods have been directly linked with 
international market prices by means of the agency system. These 
have all created important preconditions for the formation of a 
socialist market pricing mechanism. 
  However, is the task of price reform accomplished? Zou 
Xiangqun believes there is still quite a distance to go. He 
said: According to the goal of economic structural reform 
defined by the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the fundamental task 
of price reform is to establish a socialist market pricing 
mechanism. This pricing mechanism is one which relies mainly on 
market price formation and which includes government 
macroregulation and control. Its basic requirements are: In 
terms of price formation, it should enable the majority of 
commodities to enter the market, with enterprises determining 
prices according to market supply and demand. In terms of price 
operations, it should be able to regulate prices through supply 
and demand, and guide the rational allocation of resources by 
means of prices in a unified, open market environment with 
orderly competition. In terms of pricing control, a perfect and 
effective government regulatory system of prices should be 
established in order to control the pricing bodies in adopting 
pricing actions in line with the economic and legal standards of 
the market. 
  Comparing current achievements with these goals of reform, 
what would you consider lacking? Zou Xiangqun answered: 
  First, the market system is not sufficiently mature. 
Currently, the market structure is rather monolithic and the 
development of the market of production factors has just begun. 
The market is still relatively small, with imperfect 
facilities, and the means of transaction are backward. Market 
regulations are imperfect. Regional and market barriers still 
exist. Prices formed in this kind of market cannot sensitively 
reflect the situation of gross supply and demand in society, nor 
the degree of shortage in resources. They cannot accurately 
send out signals to guide the allocation of resources. The 
price fluctuations in December 1993 occurred under a situation 
in which China's grain production enjoyed bumper harvests for 
years, state grain reserves were ample, and gross supply and 
demand were balanced. This, to a great degree, was directly 
linked to the fact that China's market system is insufficiently 
developed. 
  Second, reform of enterprise internal operational mechanisms 
has not been accomplished. As pricing entities, even though 
enterprises already have the competition encouragement 
mechanism, in general they still lack a risk control mechanism, 
lack a perfect internal price management system, and lack the 
knowledge, experience, and skills to scientifically determine 
prices. During the first half of last year, some large steel 
plants took the opportunity of an explosion in the scale of 
investment, as well as the flourishing market in construction 
materials, to compete with each other in jacking up prices, or 
even cooperated in raising prices. Thus, within a short period 
of time, the prices of steel products doubled, and this was then 
followed by a sharp price drop and overstocking of steel, making 
production and turnover difficult for the enterprises. This is a 
typical example in this respect. 
  Third, a price regulatory and control system has yet to be 
established. After the scope of direct-management of prices by 
the government is largely reduced, as far as the prices of the 
majority of commodities and services are concerned, an effective 
pricing regulation and control system and a perfect legal system 
concerning pricing have yet to be established. Although the 
state has begun building a reserve for some commodities and a 
few areas have established price regulation funds for a few very 
important goods, on the whole, the economic means are still 
weak, legislation lags behind, and control and regulation are 
limp. These have become a conspicuous contradiction in the 
current reform. 
  Fourth, the price system has not yet been completely 
straightened out. The prices of energy, railway transportation, 
and a few basic products and infrastructure are still relatively 
low, which is harmful to the optimal allocation of resources. 
The purchase price of grain is also irrational, the comparative 
efficiency of agricultural production is down, the scissors 
difference between industrial and farm products -- which was 
already reduced after reform -- has again showed signs of 
expanding in recent years. This is not good for the stable 
development of agricultural production. All these indicate that 
in order to accomplish the task of price reform, much hard and 
practical work needs to be done, especially in the continued 
development of the market system, in establishing a unified and 
open market system with orderly competition, in promoting reform 
of the enterprise internal operational mechanism and the 
development of market entities, and in the speedy establishment 
of a healthy price regulation and control system and the 
continued straightening out of price relationships between 
important commodities. Only thus can we build a socialist 
market pricing mechanism. 
<H5>  One Must Not Wash One's Hands of Prices Under a Market </H5>
Economy 
  The main features of market economy are to use economic 
interest as the basic driving force and to realize the best 
allocation of resources through the market. This kind of 
economy has a mechanism to encourage competition and vitality, 
and is a law-oriented economy which can restrict the spontaneous 
and blindly generated negative effects of the market. A 
socialist market pricing mechanism must also fully embody these 
main features. 
  After the prices of the majority of commodities and services 
were freed up, manufacturers and businessmen obtained the right 
to determine prices, and the enthusiasm to produce and operate 
were greatly uplifted. This has obviously promoted economic 
development, boosted market prosperity, and improved people's 
living standards. However, at the same time, in some regions, 
departments, enterprises, and organizations, certain chaotic 
phenomena have occurred, such as superseding the power to fix 
prices, unduly collecting fees, monopolizing prices, seeking 
exorbitant profits, piggy-backing on price-hikes, raising prices 
without permission, competing with others in raising prices, 
asking for unlimited high prices, cheating customers, producing 
and selling fake and shoddy goods, and so on. Although these 
problems are expressed in different forms and different degrees 
in various places and aspects, they are very harmful, and to a 
certain extent they have pushed the general level of prices up. 
According to estimates, in the general 13 percent rise of 
retail prices during 1993, 6.8 percent were spontaneous price 
rises, of which a fair proportion was caused by chaos in the 
pricing order. This chaos in the pricing order was, 
fundamentally speaking, a disorderly action caused by the 
pursuit of self-interest by various interest groups, with 
disregard to the social effects during the process of drastic 
changes in the distribution of interests. It was a reflection 
of the spontaneity and blindness of the market economy. In 
order to prevent and overcome the damaging effects this 
spontaneity and blindness may cause, the state must conduct 
macromanagement over economic activities and market prices. 
  Western countries with market economies do not completely 
let 
prices go. Zou Xiangqun says all the major developed countries 
have established price management organizations of different 
levels and different types which adopt direct management, 
indirect management, and supervision and inspection measures 
over prices of commodities and services according to different 
situations. Japan established a national centralized price 
management organization which has the Cabinet Meeting on Pricing 
as the decisionmaking organ over pricing, and the Economic 
Planning Agency's Pricing Office as its central executive organ. 
France has the National Competition Commission, General Bureau 
for Competitive Consumption and Antifraud Inspection. Thailand 
has the Commission for Fair Pricing and Antimonopoly under the 
Ministry of Commerce in charge of prices nationwide. The United 
States does not have a national centralized price control 
organization. Supervision and control on the general level of 
prices is carried out by the federal Labor Department. 
Regulation and control of railway freight prices is under the 
government's Interstate Commerce Commission, while the 
supervision of consumer interests and enterprise prices is taken 
care of by the Consumer Bureau. In Germany, commodity prices 
under the management of the state are normally under the care of 
economic departments of state governments. Prices that are 
directly managed by the government in Japan include petroleum, 
coal, railways, passenger transportation, public housing, land 
prices, rice, cigarettes, and table salt. These occupy 
approximately 18 percent of the commodities, calculated 
according to consumer price indices. In America, these include 
utilities, electricity, taxis, subways, telephones and 
telecommunication, cable TV, running water, gas, public rental 
housing, and museum tickets, which account for 5 to 10 percent 
of citizens' consumer spending. In France, these include public 
transport, post and telecommunications, medicine, alcohol, 
education, military products, agricultural produce, etc., 
occupying around 20 percent of commodities and fees. In Germany 
these include railways, pharmaceuticals, coal, farm produce, 
fees of lawyers, architects, and notaries, and insurance as 
required by law, which occupy 22 to 26 percent of commodities 
and utility fees. 
  There are three forms of indirect management of prices: The 
first is to regulate total supply and demand by using banking 
and financial policies, adjusting the discount rate of capital 
reserves and interest rates, using government budgets, and 
adjusting government expenditures. The second is to use 
industrial policies to support the development of key 
industries. For instance, to protect farmers' interests, the 
United States practices a supporting price and subsidies policy 
on farm produce, with a total subsidy of over $15 billion. The 
European Community and Japan also have substantial subsidies on 
farm produce. The third is social interference measures, 
namely, supervising price by means of consumer councils or 
intervening by means of public opinion. Foreign countries also 
attach importance to supervision and inspection of prices and 
have special price inspection teams. In some countries price 
inspectors have guns, and when necessary they can conduct 
searches. Serious offenders are subject to legal punishment. 
Looking at the world today, whether developed or developing, 
not a single country takes a completely laissez-faire attitude 
toward prices. 
  Zou Xiangqun says, based on rich practical experience 
gained since China's reform and opening to the outside world and 
taking into consideration some common methods used in Western 
countries under a market economy, the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee made explicit stipulations 
concerning the building of a macroregulatory and control system. 
The "Decision Concerning Some Issues for Establishing a 
Socialist Market Economic Structure" passed by the plenary 
session pointed out: "To establish a perfect macroregulatory 
and control system with indirect regulation and control as the 
main means, to guarantee the healthy operation of the national 
economy"; "to further change the operational mechanism of 
state-owned enterprises"; and "to establish a national, unified 
and open market system..." are an interconnected and 
intercontrolling organic whole, composing the basic framework of 
a socialist market economic structure. Centering on these major 
points, we must establish a corresponding legal system and adopt 
practical measures to actively and systematically "push forward 
reform comprehensively and promote the development of the social 
productive forces." 
<H5>  Establishing a New Price Regulation System Is an Urgent Task </H5>
of Current Price Reform 
  Under the new situation of intensified marketization of the 
Chinese economy, to continuously push forward the reform of the 
economic system, accelerate and improve macroregulation and 
control, prevent market prices from drastic fluctuations, 
control excessive price rises, standardize pricing actions, and 
realize fair competition, fair transaction, and legal 
operations, one must establish a perfect and effective 
government regulation and control system over prices. 
  Zou Xiangqun points out, the price regulation and control 
system must embody the demands of a market economy, and the 
focus of regulation and control should be on maintaining the 
economic overall balance, with macroregulation and control as 
the main means. The objects of regulation and control should be 
those deciding the prices and the market, with indirect 
regulation and control as the main means. The means of 
regulation and control should be mainly economic and legal, 
supplemented with necessary administrative means. The 
establishment of such a pricing regulation and control system is 
a gradual process which, following the deepening of reform, the 
strengthening of economic power, and the perfection of laws, 
will continuously enrich and perfect the means of regulation and 
control. This will take a fairly long time to accomplish. 
  Currently, Zou Xiangqun believes that, in the context of the 
objectives of stabilizing market prices and standardizing 
pricing actions, we should tackle the establishment of healthy 
economic and legal means of price control in the following 
respects: 
  -- Establish a reserve system for important commodities such 
as grain, cotton, and oil, so that these can be dumped on the 
market when fluctuations occur in production or supply. 
  -- Establish grain and nonstaple food price-regulation funds 
to keep down prices, protect production and consumption, and 
stabilize the economy when great upheavals and drops appear in 
prices. 
  -- Perfect price laws and regulations, encourage 
competition, 
and oppose monopolies; protect legal gains and oppose exorbitant 
profiteering; and protect proper business operations, oppose 
cheating and overcharging customers, and crack down on fake and 
shoddy commodities. The "Regulations on Clearly Marking the 
Prices of Commodities and Services," issued for implementation 
in early March of this year by the State Planning Commission 
with the approval of the State Council is an important economic 
legal regulation promoting open transactions in the market, 
raising the visibility of pricing actions, and opposing cheating 
in prices. 
  -- Conduct price information services. The pricing 
departments at various levels should fully make use of the 
government's information network, and according to the needs of 
society, extensively collect, arrange, and develop price 
information; provide, in a timely fashion, information to 
enterprises concerning the market supply and demand of various 
important commodities, the pricing situation, and predictions of 
trends; and they should offer price information services by 
serving as price consultants, offering consultations on specific 
topics, issuing publications and other means, to guide 
enterprises in organizing their production according to market 
demands and adjusting their operational orientation. 
  -- Strengthen policy direction and professional training for 
enterprises, and help enterprise managers to master marketing 
strategies and decisionmaking skills in pricing. 
  -- Undertake appropriate administrative intervention in a 
small number of important commodities. For the basic means of 
production and necessities of daily life which easily suffer 
from price fluctuations, necessary and appropriate intervention 
should be undertaken according to different circumstances, and 
price-limiting measures, such as keeping records of any price 
rises or requiring applications for price rises, should be 
practiced. 
  Zou Xiangqun says that the State Council recently decided to 
practice price supervision on 20 types of commodities and 
services most crucial to people's lives. This is a new measure 
which makes a breakthrough in important commodities and a new 
measure for stabilizing people's lives and pushing forward the 
reform in the price regulation and control system. It embodies 
the principle of using indirect regulation and control as the 
main means and combines economic means with appropriate 
administrative intervention. It is beneficial to maintaining the 
relative stability of the general level of prices. We should 
earnestly implement the various measures of price supervision in 
coordination with the reality in order to render better service 
to reform, development, and stability.

<F P=106> ["Liaowang Forum" by staff commentator: "The Fundamental </F>
Way Out is To Increase Effective Supply--More on the Issue of 
Commodity Prices"] 
  [Text] Price is the barometer of the market. It touches 
on the interests of numerous households and has a bearing on 
economic and social stability. The fundamental way to stabilize 
prices and the market is to do a solid job of agriculture, in 
particular, the building of the "shopping basket" project, and 
increase effective supply in society while launching a mass 
price survey and improving and strengthening macroregulation and 
control. 
  Developments in the last 40 years or so since the founding 
of 
the PRC and especially in the last 15 years since the drive of 
reform and opening up to the outside world was launched have 
shown that instability in agricultural production is bound to 
lead to fluctuations in economic development. On the contrary, 
if agriculture progresses smoothly, the rural economic 
environment is fine, and the whole society enjoys relative 
stability, reform and development will advance comparatively 
smoothly. This is where the significance lies for the party 
Central Committee and the State Council to always attach great 
importance to agriculture and rural work and for the central 
authorities to stress once again at a rural work conference, 
which was held this year, that unremitting efforts should be 
made to place rural work before work in other fields. Prominence 
should be given to the production of grain, cotton, and edible 
oil, and the "shopping basket" project, and the effective supply 
of agricultural and sideline products should be increased. 
  A relatively great number of reform measures are to be 
promulgated this year, and a readjustment of people's interest 
relations and society's interest pattern and the resulting 
frictions will thus intensify. Smoothly carrying on reforms in 
various fields of endeavor requires the maintenance of social 
stability and setting people's minds at rest. One of the 
sources which most directly and sensitively reflects people's 
sense of security and stability, their support for reform, and 
their confidence in the future, is market supply. Whether there 
are plenty of goods or not in the "shopping basket" has a direct 
bearing on the people's sentiments and enthusiasm for production 
and work. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the "rice 
bag" and "shopping basket" projects and do a good job of the 
production and supply of grain, cotton, edible oil, and other 
agricultural and sideline products to ensure the basic 
livelihood of the people throughout the nation and proceed to 
continuously improve their standard of living. With their lives 
stable, the masses of the people will support reform and plunge 
themselves into reform and construction with greater enthusiasm. 
To make sure that residents have an ample supply of non-staple 
foods whose prices are stable and rich in variety, we should 
advocate taking the interests of the whole into account, 
guaranteeing selected projects, and correctly handling the 
relationship between the "shopping basket" project and work in 
other fields. We maintain that a modern city is inseparable 
from good municipal administrative service facilities and a 
complete industrial production layout. If blind efforts are 
made to build more factories and office buildings and run 
economic development zoners of various types to the neglect or 
weakening of the construction of non-staple food production 
bases, which guarantee supplies of residents' basic daily 
necessities, there will not be enough food in residents' 
"shopping baskets," commodity shortages will occur, and total 
supply and demand will be imbalanced. In the final analysis, 
economic development would hardly last long. In this sense, 
that the party Central Committee and the State Council have 
stressed doing a good job in the construction of the "shopping 
basket" is a strategic move taken to meet the needs of urban 
economic development, rather than just building a stable 
"logistic supply base." 
  Doing a good job in the construction of the "shopping 
basket" 
project and improving the quantity and quality of agricultural 
and sideline projects is also a way out of readjusting the 
agricultural production structure and increasing peasants' 
incomes. As a big country where agriculture is predominant, 
China has a population of close to 1.2 billion people, of which 
900 million live in the countryside. This is China's most 
important national condition. In the past 15 years of reform, 
there has been a very significant increase in peasants' incomes. 
Nevertheless, the increase is still far below the growth in 
urban per-capita incomes. Now, to raise peasants' incomes, 
major efforts should be made to develop second and tertiary 
industries in rural areas. Concentrating efforts on readjusting 
the structure of agricultural production, developing more 
industrial crops, in particular, products relating to the 
"shopping basket" project, will have a very effective and direct 
bearing on increasing peasants' incomes. Here we cite a case in 
point. In 1991, Taian City, Shandong, invested 18 million yuan 
in running a "Shopping Basket Science and Technology Park." It 
developed vegetable production according to international 
standards and sold its products to 156 countries and regions. 
In the January- May period last year alone, the city earned 
$11.6 million in foreign exchange through exporting its 
products. Taian's way of doing things shows that carefully 
designing and implementing the "shopping basket" project is also 
an important way of increasing peasants' incomes and achieving a 
well-off standard of living in rural areas. 
  Developing the production of agricultural and sideline 
products, including vegetables, is a business promising 
relatively high efficiency, for which the peasants are willing 
to work with enthusiasm. However, the business is highly risky. 
Particularly at a time when the peasants have very limited 
means to obtain market information and a limited ability to take 
the market well in hand and have difficulties in transportation, 
storage, and fund raising, for producers to appropriately decide 
the scope of production and variety in accordance with accurate 
and comprehensive market information, ensure supply and demand 
are balanced, the production structure is rational, peasants' 
incomes rise steadily, and market swings are reduced or avoided, 
it is necessary to establish a reserve system and risk 
regulating funds for meat, vegetables, and other major 
agricultural and sideline products, perfect the information 
network, form a management and regulation and control mechanism 
based on economic and legal means, and protect the interests of 
producers and consumers. This is also necessary and proper 
government behavior in a market economy. 
  As production expands, it is necessary to closely integrate 
producing and marketing areas as well as vegetable growers and 
consumers; form operational mechanisms for total quantity 
balance, the smooth circulation of commodities, and operational 
flexibility; and establish a market system for agricultural and 
sideline products centering on wholesale markets. At present, 
China has many wholesale markets, which have played a positive 
role in promoting the shipping of vegetables from the South to 
the North, grain from the North to the South, and grain from the 
Center to the West. However, because of the lack of a number of 
large-scale, multifunctional and comprehensive trans-regional 
backbone markets, the circulation of agricultural and sideline 
products in different regions has been hamstrung to a certain 
extent. To genuinely achieve a free flow of commodities across 
the country; promote the structural readjustment of non-staple 
foods in terms of producing areas, seasons, and variety; and the 
improvement of their commercialization levels, it is still 
necessary to further establish and improve central, regional, 
and local multilayer wholesale networks, promote the formation 
of a single national market, and at the same time, standardize 
market order, reduce the number of operational links, remove 
circulation barriers and improper trading behaviors, and enable 
the "shopping basket" project to play an important role in 
harmonizing the relationship between production, circulation, 
and consumption as market mechanisms and macroregulation and 
control play their own part.

  [Text] Beijing, 10 March (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
recently issued a circular to 18 provinces, autonomous regions, 
and municipalities including Shangdong, Hebei, Henan, Xinjiang, 
Jiangsu, and Hubei, urging them to conscientiously carry out 
this year's cotton production plan. 
  The circular said: Cotton is an important material which has 
a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood. 
To promote cotton production on the eve of spring planting, the 
following points are hereby announced: 
  1. It is necessary to try in every possible way to increase 
cotton acreage to ensure that this year's cotton production task 
ordered by the state will be accomplished. To increase cotton 
production, we should enlarge cotton acreage and focus on spring 
planting. Untilled and reserved farmland in the 
cotton-producing areas of the Huanghe, the Huaihe, and the Haihe 
shall be planted with cotton on a priority basis. Areas with 
suitable conditions should be planted with cotton this summer. 
Active measures should be taken to plant cotton in wastelands. 
Shandong, Hebei, and Henan should greatly increase their cotton 
acreage to their former levels. For cotton-producing areas in 
the south, efforts should be made to increase cotton acreage. 
In addition, those areas with suitable conditions should be 
planted with cotton plants after the wheat harvest or should 
receive large transplanted cotton seedlings. Xinjiang should 
gradually increase its cotton acreage. Agricultural departments 
should take measures to provide cotton seeds. 
  2. Great efforts should be made to support large 
cotton-producing counties so as to promote rapid economic growth 
in these areas. The state will arrange special loans for large 
cotton-producing counties to develop their economies. Such 
loans as well as future investment for the economic development 
of quality-cotton-producing counties shall be commensurate with 
their cotton acreage, production output, and amount of cotton 
sold to the state. 
  3. It is necessary to persist in the principle of increasing 
cotton production by relying on science and education. Great 
efforts should be made to increase the per unit-area yield. It 
is necessary to strengthen technical training, to popularize 
cotton-planting knowledge, and to actively promote such 
production techniques as the use of plastic films, seedling 
transplants, growing cotton after the wheat harvest, using 
chemical fertilizers and insecticides, employing model 
cultivation, and employing comprehensive pest management. The 
acreage planted with fine cotton strains should be increased. 
In some areas, cotton bollworms were found to lay more eggs 
last winter than in previous years. We should be careful about 
this problem. We should pay attention to preventing cotton 
bollworms right from the spring planting. 
  4. Governments at all levels in cotton-producing areas 
should 
immediately map out a plan for this year's cotton production. 
Major leading comrades should be directly in charge of cotton 
production. Great efforts should be made to publicize the 
state's policy concerning cotton production. It is necessary to 
encourage peasants to grow more cotton and to produce fine 
cotton. It is imperative to organize agricultural and other 
departments to go down to the grass-roots units in rural areas 
to provide concrete guidance. It is also imperative to organize 
well the supply of means of agricultural production and to help 
grass-roots units and peasants solve actual problems in cotton 
production.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- A national symposium on 
the reform of the circulation system was held in Beijing 
recently. The meeting put forward a general plan for the 
building of a market system in China, calling for introducing a 
unified, open, competitive, and orderly market system and 
establishing a close link between urban and rural markets and 
between domestic and international markets so as to improve the 
allocation of resources. 
  The symposium was held jointly by the State Economic 
Restructuring Commission, the State Planning Commission, the 
State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Internal 
Trade, and the State Statistical Bureau. The meeting put 
forward specific ideas for the direction of promoting the reform 
of China's circulation system until the end of this century. 
  The meeting pointed out that the special characteristics of 
the basic framework of a socialist market system should have a 
new relations of exchange in market and a sound market 
regulation mechanism; have circulation markets which can suit 
the needs of a market economy; have sound commodity market 
organizations; form, in the main, a market system for factors of 
production; have a sound market supervision and control system; 
have sound rules and regulations for market operation; have a 
sound system for adjusting and storing important commodities, 
and establish links between the domestic market and the 
international market. 
  Concerning the steps and phases for realizing the 
improvement 
of the market system, the meeting pointed out: In carrying out 
reform in the last two years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan 
period, it is necessary to vigorously develop regional wholesale 
markets, further expand the scope of market adjustment, improve 
large-scale wholesale markets and exchanges which are geared to 
the needs of the whole country, establish a better commodity 
market system, vigorously develop production factor markets, 
promote the circulation of production factors, realize the 
single price system for production factors, develop long-term 
government orders and contracts, stabilize relations of demand 
and supply, cultivate a new market relationship, and establish 
and improve risk funds at central and provincial levels and a 
reserve system for grain, cotton, and other important 
commodities. During the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, we 
should, in the main, establish a market system, a sound legal 
system with necessary laws and regulations, a supervision and 
control system, a government macro-control system, and a modern 
circulation system which can meet the requirements of a 
socialist market economy so as to give full play to the market's 
basic role in the allocation of resources.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (CNS) -- Statistics released by the 
State Statistical Bureau showed that industry maintained steady 
growth last April with state-owned industry stopping its slide 
and registering a rebound to some extent. The trend of 
stockpiling of products, worsening losses and acute shortage of 
capital still go upwards. 
  The national industrial production was 20 percent up last 
April over the same period last year and 1.4 percentage points 
faster than the average growth in the previous three months. Of 
the gain, state-owned industry made up five percent, collective 
industry 31.4 percent and industry of other kinds 42.5 percent. 
  The rebound for state-owned industry in recent times is 
mainly due to a slight lessening of short-term loans given to 
enterprises by banks since last March. They played a role to 
some extent in pushing forward enterprise production. Deep 
seated contradictions suffered by state-owned enterprises, 
however, still existed. 
  As the market demand is relatively insufficient, sales of 
industrial products are far from ideal. The sales of industrial 
products last April was 2.2 percentage points lower than the 
growth in industrial production. The inventory of industrial 
products tended to go upwards month by month as a result. The 
value of stockpiled products by industry at the level of 
township and above showed a net gain of RMB [Renminbi] 20.6 
billion late last March over late last February. The inventory 
of oil-bearing items, steel materials, some industrial chemicals 
and electro-mechanical items registered a rise of 20 percent 
over earlier this year. Shortage of capital, slow sales and 
serious debt have not yet been alleviated. 
  Losses suffered by some enterprises tended to grow worse 
mainly because of sluggish sales, stockpiling of products and 
shortage of capital. There are to date some 25.7 percent of 
enterprises running in the red with state-owned enterprises 
making up 45 percent. Losses made by medium- and large-sized 
state-owned enterprises last March was put at RMB 16.6 billion, 
RMB 5.9 billion up from the previous two months. 
  State-owned industry showed relatively slow growth when 
compared with the rapid gain of overall industry in spite of its 
rise to some extent last April. State-owned industry finds it 
difficult to stand stiff competition with some of them operating 
under capacity. The number of enterprises either stopping 
production or in a state of a semi-halt to production increased 
while some of enterprises failed to pay wages, affecting 
workers' living and doing harm to social stability.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (CNS) -- According to China's 
Ministry of Civil Affairs, nearly 12 million households have 
been helped to raise themselves out of poverty in the past five 
years. 
  The central government set aside a total of RMB [Renminbi] 
6.4 billion and 8.7 billion kilograms of grain for disaster 
relief and received donations both domestically raised and from 
abroad of RMB 2.4 billion. More than 200 million 
poverty-stricken persons received such financial and material 
help, thereby guaranteeing their daily necessities. 
  In recent years, social insurance for the aged has reached 
the countryside involving 29 provinces, cities and autonomous 
regions with some 40 million farmers enjoying such insurance. 
  China has in addition continued to push reform regarding 
wedding and funeral customs and has revised the marriage 
registration method. Most towns in China now have marriage 
registration, handling ten million couples every year. China 
has in the past five years also set up more than 1,200 funeral 
parlours, cremating more than two million deceased every year, 
one-third of all deceased persons. 
  The State Council recently decided that the tenth national 
civil affairs meeting would be held this month from 12 to 16 
when a report would be given on the past five year's work and 
plans for the coming five years would be set out. Premier Li 
Peng will attend the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- China's new taxation 
system, started at the beginning of this year, has maintained 
all the preferential policies for foreign investors and is 
creating a more fair and favorable taxation environment for them. 
  This was the statement made by Dong Shukui, a senior 
official 
with the State Administration of Taxation, at the 11th 
China-Australia Senior Executive Forum held here today. 
  The leading official in charge of China's overseas-related 
taxation told reporters that since the carrying out of the new 
taxation system, the total tax burden of foreign-funded 
enterprises has decreased to some degrees, compared with the old 
taxation system. 
  According to him, foreign-funded enterprises are no longer 
paying higher taxes than domestic enterprises on 94 items, due 
to the adoption of unified value-added taxes, consumption taxes 
and business taxes for both foreign and domestic enterprises. 
  Dong told the Australian entrepreneurs that there are now 11 
kinds of taxes that are applicable to foreign-funded enterprises 
and foreign nationals according to the new taxation system, 
among which, duplication under the old industrial and commercial 
consolidated tax has been removed by introducing value-added 
taxes. 
  He explained that the value-added taxes will only be charged 
on added value derived from production processes. Higher or 
lower tax rates are related only to the added value, but not to 
the number of enterprises involved, which is believed to favor 
foreign-funded enterprises in developing coordinated and 
socialized production. 
  The official added that all the preferential policies on 
foreign-funded enterprises' income taxes will be continued. 
  According to the new system, productive foreign-funded 
enterprises established in special economic zones and economic 
and technical development zones, shall pay business income taxes 
at a reduced tax rate of 15 percent. 
  Meanwhile, productive foreign-funded enterprises located in 
coastal economic open areas and open cities shall pay business 
taxes at a reduced tax rate of 24 percent. 
  Productive foreign-funded enterprises shall be exempt from 
business income taxes in the first two profit-making years and 
pay half the business income taxes in the next three years. 
  The official told reporters that the foreign-funded 
enterprises will also continue to enjoy preferential treatment 
on turnover taxes. 
  Under the new taxation system, the foreign-funded 
enterprises 
shall be exempt from value-added taxes on imported machines, 
equipment and spare parts at import entry which are needed in 
production and do not exceed the total amount of investments. 
  In addition, foreign-funded enterprises shall be exempt from 
value-added taxes and consumption taxes on manufacturing 
products for export, excluding the ones under separate 
regulation by the government. 
  Dong Shukui noted that Sino-foreign joint-venture banks and 
foreign-funded banks registered in special economic zones and 
Shanghai's Pudong New Area can be exempt from business taxes in 
the first five years starting from opening day upon approval. 
  The official stressed that the Chinese Government will 
consistently give foreign-funded enterprises favorable policies 
and preferential treatment to boost their investment in the 
country. 
  According to Dong, 1993 was the best year in luring and 
utilizing foreign investment. The statistics by the end of last 
year showed that China had developed more than 170,000 projects 
with foreign investments and absorbed 220 billion U.S. dollars 
in foreign investment under agreement, with 60 billion U.S. 
dollars actually used at present.

<F P=106> ["Dispatch" by special reporter Li Hai (6849 3189): "China </F>
Invests 35 Billion Yuan in Construction of Railroads, 
Expressways in Southwestern Region"] 
  [Text] Nanning, 14 May (WEN WEI PO)--This reporter has 
learned from the Chinese Government department concerned that, 
to promote and speed up the economic development in the western 
and southwestern regions and to open the regions wider to the 
outside world, during the "Eighth and Ninth Five-Year Plans," 
China will invest huge sums of money in the construction of main 
lines of communication including railroads and highways. Of the 
total amount of funds for construction, 20 billion yuan will be 
provided for railroads and 15 billion for highways. 
  China will build or rebuild a total of 3,000 km of railroad 
in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. The Nanning-Kunming 
Railroad, which is now being built at a greater speed, will 
probably go into service in 1996. The Yangpingguan-Chengdu 
section of the dual-track Baoji-Chengdu Railroad, which 
constitutes the northern passageway running through the 
hinterland of the northwestern region; the Chengdu-Daxian County 
Railroad, which constitutes the eastern passageway; and the 
Yunnan-Guangda Railroad, which constitutes the western 
passageway, are now all under construction and are scheduled for 
completion in late 1995. In addition, the project to electrify 
the Chengdu-Kunming Railroad, costing 2.6 billion yuan; the 
Chongqing-Daxian County Electric Railroad; the Wanxian 
County-Daxian County line; and the Neijiang-Kunming line, are 
under construction or will begin construction shortly and they 
are scheduled to go into service within this century. 
  China will also build or rebuild 5,000 km of trunk highways 
in the three provinces and one autonomous region. Sichuan will 
invest 11.3 billion yuan in construction by building new 
highways and rebuilding old highways in an advanced principal 
highway network, which will be supported by water transport on 
the Chang Jiang, making key ports its joints and Chengdu and 
Chongqing the centers from which the network will extend in 
various directions. Sichuan will also build second-class (or 
first-class) highways which will be connected with the 
land-and-water coordinated transport networks in various 
prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities across the 
province. The networks are now connected by expressways and 
outbound waterways. The main highway linking Shanghai with 
Chengdu planned by the Communications Ministry will extend from 
Chengdu to Chongqing and Wanxian County and then proceed beyond 
Sichuan to other places. The highway will link Chongqing, 
Guiyang, Nanning, and the sea outlet in the Bacho Gulf. Under 
this plan, the first phase project will involve the building of 
800 km of advanced highways, which will serve as the main 
framework, and the building or rebuilding of 2,000 km of 
regional trunk highways. 
  The department concerned said foreign businessmen are 
welcome 
to invest in these projects.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- As construction of the 
many transport infrastructure projects is beginning to switch 
on, a huge investment market is being shaped in China's 
railways, highways, ports, civil aviation and other sectors, 
providing a rare chance for foreign investors. 
  The Chinese Government has placed great expectations on 
overseas funds in its attempt to ease up the strained 
transportation capacity, which has been a major bottleneck 
hampering the development of the national economy in recent 
years. 
  In its general outline for the last decade of the century, 
the Chinese Government has attached prime importance to the 
construction of transport infrastructure. 
  At the beginning of the 1990s, the central government 
defined 
nearly 400 large and medium-sized transport infrastructure 
construction projects, with a predicted budget of over 700 
billion yuan. Among the 151 key construction projects for 1994, 
which were announced last week by the State Planning Commission, 
33 belong to the field of transportation. 
  In the past few years China's construction of transport 
infrastructure has experienced a fairly fast development. At 
present the country has 54,000 km of railways, 1.075 million km 
of highways, over 300 deep-water berths and more than 40 large 
and medium-sized civil airports. 
  However, experts estimate that the existing infrastructure 
is 
capable of carrying only about 60 percent of the country's total 
transport demand. Railways and highways have been much more 
intensively used than called for by their designed capacity. 
Meanwhile, in important ports ships have to queue up for days 
for a berth to load or unload. 
  According to plans of related departments, by the end of 
this 
century China will have 70,000 km of operating railways, 1.2 
million km of highways, and the number of deep-water berths in 
coastal ports will exceed 600, basically alleviating the tight 
transport condition. 
  To make sure that these plans are fulfilled, while expanding 
the state investment, the Chinese Government actively encourages 
foreign investors to participate in these fields, with 
preferential policies drafted to ensure profits for foreign 
businessmen. 
  Foreign funds have, in fact, played a significant role in 
China's construction of transport infrastructure in recent years. 
  Since 1979, the country's rail construction has used loans 
of 
some 2.06 billion U.S. dollars from the Japanese Overseas 
Economic Cooperation Fund, and 1.62 billion U.S. dollars from 
the World Bank. With the help of which more than 5,700 km of new 
railways have been constructed and 6,500 km of old rail lines 
relaid. 
  To date more than two billion U.S. dollars in overseas loans 
has been used to construct more than 50 deepwater berths of 
10,000-ton class, largely promoting the handling capacity of 
China's inland and sea ports. 
  So far foreign funds going to China's transport 
infrastructure have mainly come from the World Bank, the 
Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and the Asian 
Development Bank. To raise more construction funds, the Chinese 
Government is actively exploring even more extensive foreign 
fund sources, including foreign governments, financial groups, 
investment institutions and entrepreneurs. 
  China has instituted preferential policies on tax exemption 
and reduction, rational sharing of profits and some other 
aspects for foreign investors. Moreover, many restrictions have 
been lifted to open a much wider investment field for overseas 
businessmen. 
  Sources said that all civil aviation infrastructure, except 
for the air surveillance system, are open to foreign funds; 
foreign businessmen can invest exclusively to build docks and 
open navigation channels and are allowed to construct and manage 
special port areas and docks on the tracts of land they have 
invested in. 
  In addition, China's transport infrastructure construction 
has also introduced the "build, operate and transfer" 
arrangement, which refers to a scheme in which foreign 
businessmen invest in the construction of a project, manage it 
for a fixed time, then hand over the management and ownership to 
the local government. Due to its huge potential profits, this 
arrangement has aroused deep interest among foreign investors. 
  Most of China's basic industries have defined a recovery 
rate 
higher than the credit interest rate on the international 
financial market. Experts indicate that China's transport 
infrastructure has the characteristics of low risk and a high 
recovery rate, where foreign funds will surely have bright 
prospects. 
  At present, the planned Beijing-Shanghai express railway, 
the 
national trunk highway network, and a large number of big port 
and airport projects have become the focus of foreign investors' 
attention, who are trying to negotiate with related Chinese 
departments and competing with each other for a share in the 
huge investment market.

  [Text] Wuhan, May 8 (XINHUA) -- China is planning to apply 
for foreign loans to construct ports along the Chang Jiang 
River, according to the Administration of Navigation and 
Transportation Services of the Chang Jiang River under the 
Ministry of Communications. 
  The foreign loans might come from the World Bank, the Asian 
Development Bank and foreign governments, and the related 
departments are now making efforts to fulfill the applications, 
according to an official of the administration. 
  He said that the ports to be constructed by foreign loans 
include those at Jiujiang, Wuhu, Maanshan, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, 
Jiangyin and Gaogang. 
  The total investment for the construction will be more than 
10 billion yuan in a period of ten years, he said. 
  After the projects are completed, more than 20 berths will 
be 
put into use and the handling capacity of the ports will 
increase by more than 20 million tons. 
  Over the past decade, the transportation services along the 
Chang Jiang River had grown rapidly. There are now more than 
3,000 corporations in the services and their annual transport 
capacity reached 12 million tons. 
  Now there are 25 main ports along the Chang Jiang River and 
the handling capacity was 158 million tons last year. 
  Among them, 13 have been approved as open ports to foreign 
ships.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Along with the fast 
development of the real estate sector, it is very necessary to 
formulate a special law for it and put it under legal management. 
  This is the common view of Chinese legislators as they are 
deliberating the draft law on management of urban real estate 
sector during the current session of the Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature. 
  They pointed out that arable land of China has decreased 
drastically in recent years, thus, approval and renting out of 
the land also should be put under the legal system. 
  Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peiyao said 
that it is hard to draw a clear line between rural and urban 
areas due to economic development, especially in rural industry 
and service trade. 
  The vice-chairman suggested that a unified administrative 
institution be set up for the real estate sector and a single 
law be formulated for both the urban and rural real estate 
sectors. 
  Member Qin Zhongda said that large-scale development of land 
will likely take place as many people want to reap huge profits 
from it. The law should provide concrete regulations on how to 
save land, prevent its waste and punish those bent on 
trafficking in it. Otherwise, people's living environment will 
be greatly damaged. 
  Member Tao Dayong, who is also an economist, pointed out 
that 
the draft law under deliberation is very important and ought to 
be passed as soon as possible. 
  The economist expressed his worry that without the law, the 
unhealthy development of the sector will possibly affect 
reforms, development and social stability. 
  Member Zou Jue maintained that lax administration of the 
sector has also led to corruption among some grassroots 
officials. 
  The woman legislator Lin Liyun stressed the protection of 
private real estate of overseas Chinese and their relatives in 
China. 
  She said that governments at all levels have done a lot in 
recent years in returning houses to Overseas Chinese and their 
relatives. But new violations of their rights have happened 
during recent urban construction and the development of the real 
estate sector. The law should make clear provisions on this, 
she said.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Farm Plan Aims To Maximize Production"] </F>
  [Text] In a major effort to stem the continuing shrinkage 
of arable farmland, the government has mapped out a nationwide 
agricultural zoning programme that will specify how farmland is 
to be used. 
  Designed to coordinate the use of agricultural resources, it 
focuses on tapping all available land to boost farm output. 
  Under the plan, which is to be unveiled later this year, 10 
major farming regions have been targeted for the production of 
grain, cotton, edible oil, and meat. 
  They are administered by the state and are located in 
Northeast China's Three Rivers Plain (Heilongjiang, 
Songhuajiang, and Usuli Rivers) and Songhua-Liao Rivers Plain, 
the region of Yellow River, Huaihe River and Haihe River, the 
northern region of East China, and the middle and lower reaches 
of the Yangtze River. 
  The state-level development zones cover 15 provinces and 
municipalities and account for 39.2 percent of the country's 
total farmland involving 36.6 percent of total population. 
  In addition, 16 areas have been selected as provincial-level 
development zones, according to Zhang Qiaoling, director of the 
Department of Agricultural Regional Planning under the Ministry 
of Agriculture. 
  Priorities include upgrading the country's vast low-yield 
farmland and developing unused land, Zhang said yesterday. 
  "There is great potential for in-depth development of 
agricultural resources in the country through boosting the per 
hectare output of all available land," she said. 
  According to Zhang, low-yield land covers 86.7 million 
hectares or 86 percent of the country's arable land, 78 percent 
of its aquatic farms, and a quarter of its woodlands. 
  A recently concluded three-year survey by the Agricultural 
Ministry and other departments shows that of China's 100 million 
hectares of farmland, 20 million hectares have poor soil, 20 
million hectares suffer from water shortages, 13.3 million 
hectares are barren hilly terrain and 3.3 million hectares are 
saline-alkali soil. 
  Yet many of these areas can be transformed through new 
farming techniques that will increase output by as much as 100 
percent, she said. 
  But she added the country can only improve a small portion 
of 
its waste land, uncultivated hills, shoals, and offshore waters 
for agricultural use. 
  Based on the survey results, the government's development 
scheme will coordinate resources to maximize agricultural output. 
  The 10 zones set up so far each has a blueprint covering 
harvesting, animal husbandry, rural industry, farm machinery, 
forestry, water and soil conservation, groundwater, feeds, and 
mineral fertilizers. 
  Zhang said that in the past, resources have been wasted or 
exploited because of lack of coordination. 
  And in the past few years, more farmland has been taken over 
by industry and residential development, she said. 
  Some 133,000 hectares of farmland are also lost each year to 
natural disasters while a total of 26.7 million hectares of 
grassland have become less productive or barren because of 
overuse, the survey said. 
  According to Zhang, at least 123 million hectares of arable 
land -- at the current per hectare output -- are needed to feed 
and clothe China's population by the year 2000, which stands at 
about 1.2 billion at present. 
  To compensate for this deficit -- China has 100 million 
hectares of arable land -- the government plans to boost the 
output of 33.3 million hectares of low and medium-yield fields 
by the year 2000. 
  Over 3 million hectares of wasteland and barren land will 
also be reclaimed under the programme's first phase.

  [Text] Yinchuan, May 10 (XINHUA) -- China has brought 1.7 
million ha [hectares] of its deserts under control through 
various afforestation efforts over the past two years, a senior 
forestry official said here today. 
  Zhu Guangyao, deputy minister of forestry, told a national 
desert survey and monitoring conference that the efforts include 
planting 1.6 million ha of trees, desert-control extension 
projects in 20 counties and nine experimental zones. 
  Desertification is one of the world's ten major 
environmental 
issues, while China is one of the countries where desert 
encroachment is a serious problem, he said. Some 15.9 percent 
of the total land area, or 1.53 million sq [square] km are under 
serious threat of desertification. 
  Zhu said 371,000 sq km of such land causes 4.5 billion yuan 
(about 520 million U.S. dollars) in direct economic losses 
annually to local people. 
  To change this situation, the State Council, China's highest 
governing body, for the first time listed desert control as one 
of the major environmental control efforts in the ten-year 
program for national economic and social development in 1991. 
  To carry out the program, the State Council has called two 
national desertification conferences and ratified ten-year 
desert control projects and enacted some preferential policies 
to this end. 
  At present, some 600 development projects are being carried 
out in the desert areas in China so as to make the best use of 
desert resources for economic development. 
  Despite these efforts, however, Zhu Guangyao warned that 
desertification is still a challenge for China, and 
environmental deterioration in desert areas remains a chronic 
problem. 
  Estimates show that China's desert area will grow at a rate 
of 1.33 percent annually if effective measures are not taken in 
the upcoming ten years. This means that China would have 
another 2300 sq km of desert every year, the equivalent of a 
medium-sized Chinese county. 
  Moreover, regional desertification looms large in some 
grassland, hilly and dry areas in Hebei Province, and the Inner 
Mongolia and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions, where 
desertification is growing at a rate of five percent a year. 
  Hulun Buir League, a grassland area in Inner Mongolia, is 
being threatened by four growing desert zones and serious dune 
flows. The large-scale exploitation of coal, oil and gas 
resources in the northwest will put new pressure on the region's 
fragile ecological environment, he noted. 
  Viewing the reasons for China's desertification, experts 
said 
it is partly the result of global warming, escalating drought 
and weak environmental protection in some areas in face of 
booming economic development.

  With a sound economic foundation, the Chang Jiang Delta 
generates 40 percent of the nation's industrial and agricultural 
output value and 50 percent of the state revenue each year. 
  In December 1985 the governments of Shanghai, China's 
largest 
economic center; Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu 
Province; Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province; and 
Chongqing, a populous city in southwest China, sponsored a Chang 
Jiang Valley economic coordination association. 
  The association, with 23 member cities, has been playing a 
big role in opening further to the outside world, with 
Shanghai's Pudong new area, China's largest economic and 
technological development zone, as the leader since 1992. 
  In line with its geographical conditions, the valley has 
formed five economically coordinated zones: the Chang Jiang 
Delta economic co-operation zone headed by Shanghai, the lower 
reaches economic co-operation zone with Nanjing as the leader, 
the middle reaches economic co-operation zone with Wuhan as the 
center, the upper reaches economic co-operation zone led by 
Chongqing, and the Panxi-Liupanshui development zone at the 
juncture of the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and the Jinsha 
Jiang. 
  The 23 major cities in the valley have set up 10 special 
co-operation groups in the fields of science, funding, 
navigation, tourism, posts and telecommunications, material 
supply, trade, environmental protection and social science. 
  Last year saw these cities lend and borrow a total of 231 
billion yuan among themselves. 
  The special co-operation group for environmental protection 
has set up a monitoring network consisting of 150 stations along 
the Chang Jiang to protect the local ecological conditions. 
  The gross domestic product of Pudong increased by 30 percent 
last year, thanks to the accessibility of funds, materials, 
talented people and information from the Chang Jiang Valley's 
Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and Sichuan 
Provinces.

  [Text] Fuzhou, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in Fujian, a 
coastal province in China's southeast, have become major hard 
currency earners as it has reorienting their rural industry to 
the export market. 
  According to a local official, farmers here produced 18.9 
billion yuan-worth of farm products for the international market 
last year, an increase of 91.7 percent over the previous year. 
  The figure, he said, represents 17.9 percent of the 
province's total agricultural and industrial output. Most of 
these items are produced in Fuzhou, the provincial capital, and 
Xiamen and Quanzhou cities, and the districts of Nanping, Ningde 
and Longyan. 
  To enhance exports, the province has established a number of 
production bases for fruits, flowers, vegetables, edible fungus 
and sea food.

  [Text] Public security organs throughout the province have 
brought the role of discipline inspection, supervision, and 
auditing departments into full play; persisted in managing 
police forces strictly; strengthened legal inspection; strictly 
enforced auditing rules and regulations; and exercised strict 
supervision over everything; thus achieving phased results in 
their anticorruption struggle. During the struggle, among 
public security personnel across the province, 343 cadres at the 
county and section levels and 204 county and city public 
security bureau directors and political commissars earnestly 
conducted self-examination and self-correction. Anticorruption 
reporting telephone lines were installed; 308 submissions of 
anticorruption cases were handled; 170 police officers and men 
were seriously investigated and punished; the unhealthy 
practices of wantonly collecting fees, fines, and apportionments 
was severely curbed; 20 wanton-collection items were scrapped; 
excessively collected fees amounting to 430,000 yuan were 
returned to their owners, while fees amounting to 640,000 yuan 
were turned to the state treasury; and 169 companies and 
economies entities of various types operated by public security 
organs were cleared up and rectified, or were disbanded and 
decoupled from the public security organs. The province also 
set up 158 law enforcement and inspection teams to earnestly 
conduct a mass law enforcement survey and solve problems 
cropping up in the course of law enforcement, such as bending 
the law for the benefit of relatives or friends, bending the law 
out for personal considerations, not being strict in enforcing 
laws, and not enforcing laws impartially, thus putting an end to 
the unhealthy practices of engaging in smuggling, protecting 
smuggling, and seizing smugglers or smuggled goods by 
overstepping their authority. 
  Auditing and supervision departments have served not only as 
guardians for economic management, but also as doctors for money 
management. Since 1989, they have halted and corrected 
discipline violations involving a total amount of 13.46 million 
yuan and have increased revenues amounting to 320,000 yuan by 
saving losses and waste, thus promoting public security organs 
to use their limited funds where they were needed most.

  [Text] Jinan, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Shandong Province has 
become China's first province to be basically free from leprosy. 
  According to the Ministry of Public Health, the province 
also 
took the lead in the country in wiping out kala-azar, filariasis 
and malaria. 
  According to historical data, this coastal province in east 
China has had a history of leprosy of 2,500 years. 
  A survey in 1960 found that the incidence of leprosy reached 
0.1 percent in 16 counties and 0.01 percent to 0.1 percent in 74 
counties. 
  To wipe out the infectious disease, the Shandong provincial 
government has set up 79 special leprosy control and treatment 
organizations since 1955. These organizations have employed 
1,691 people. 
  While launching massive publicity on the elimination of 
leprosy, these organizations have carefully ferreted out leprosy 
cases and effectively studied and treated the diseases over the 
past four decades. 
  By the end of last year the province had cured 39,654 
leprosy 
cases. 
  Shandong now has 255 patients under treatment. 
  Its incidence of leprosy over the past five years has 
dropped 
below 0.5 per 100,000 people, reaching the standard set by the 
Ministry of Public Health.

  [Text] Shenzhen, May 9 (CNS) -- Shenzhen is seeing an 
annual increase in spending on its water supply system, put at 
RMB [Renminbi] 480 million for this year for a water resources 
project, water supply work and a water treatment plant. The 
amount of capital involved is over 100 percent up over last 
year, an historical record for the input of capital into the 
water supply system. 
  Shenzhen and its adjacent city of Hong Kong suffer from a 
water shortage while China as a whole is a country short of 
water. Shenzhen has in recent years seen rapid economic 
development. A sharp rise in its population has resulted in an 
unbalance of supply and demand of water. According to the water 
supply programme for the municipality, the year-round general 
demand for water by the year 2000 will be 1.62 billion cubic 
metres. The water for the present annual demand is about one 
billion cubic metres while the supply of water is much less than 
the demand, making Shenzhen one of the seven cities suffering 
the most serious water shortage across the country. 
  The municipality established a water bureau responsible for 
planning for the water supply. According to the plan, Shenzhen 
will carry out work on three networks for the water supply in a 
bid to develop a unified water supply system across the 
municipality. The entire project needs a total input of between 
RMB 4 billion and RMB 5 billion. 
  Shenzhen has spent a sum of money on the building up of its 
water supply system in the past three years. The input of 
capital into water resources was put at RMB 100 million in 1992 
and RMB 200 million in 1993. The water resources project this 
year will cost RMB 140 million while the water supply work and 
the water treatment plant will see a gross input of RMB 340 
million. 
  A number of water conservancy projects either newly set up 
or 
expanded have been carried out in the last three years. They 
include expansion ofthe Meilin Reservoir, a water diversion 
project and work on the Meilin water plant. 
  Shenzhen has so far made the Shenzhen Reservoir as its main 
source of water supply supported by the Tiegang Reservoir and 
the Xiuli Reservoir. The Meilin Reservoir will play a role in 
balancing the water supply network across the municipality.

  [Text] Haikou, 9 May (XINHUA) -- The Hainan Armed Police 
Corps recently captured a crime gang in Xinpo Town in Qiongshan 
City. 
  Chen Pixiong, Zhou Nucai, Liu Jiujin and others in the 
village assembled a dozen of so young people who loved pleasures 
and loathed work and formed themselves into a gang. So far this 
year they have regularly used guns and other lethal weapons to 
stop vehicles travelling on the expressway by the village and 
rob the passengers of their money and belongings; and they also 
entered people's houses to steal and rob them. The money and 
belongings they have stolen exceeded 200,000 yuan. 
  Determined to annihilate the gang, the Qiongshan Municipal 
Public Security Bureau had on many occasions sent police to the 
town to detect the gang's whereabouts. On the night of 27 
April, public security police, with the masses' assistance, 
learned that the gang's ringleaders and other members had 
returned to the village to rest, and immediately informed the 
Hainan Public Security Department, which in turn informed the 
Hainan Armed Police Corps, demanding that personnel be sent to 
the village to destroy the gang. The Hainan Armed Police Corps 
immediately selected 50 officers and men to encircle and capture 
the gang. Early in the morning the next day, the armed police, 
without firing a single bullet, captured all the ringleaders and 
members of the gang.

"A Factual Account of the Capturing of a Crime Gang in 
Qiongshan"; Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 0935 
GMT on 9 May transmits a service message replacing the following 
item with the item published above] 
  [Text] Haikou, 9 May (XINHUA) -- It was early in the 
morning on 28 April 1994, and Aopo, a village 20 kilometers 
southwest of Xinpo Town in Qiongshan City, Hainan, was engulfed 
by darkness. 
  At 0330, four white police vehicles quietly parked by the 
village. Hopping out from the first was Yang Shouhua, deputy 
chief of the Hainan Armed Police Corps. He was followed by Xu 
Mingzhi and Cheng Zhongli, respectively chief and deputy chief 
of staff of the third detachment; and Wei Gang, a training 
section chief. After they consulted with each other for a short 
while, they motioned the other vehicles, and over 40 
awe-inspiring special police force members -- wearing helmets, 
camouflaged uniforms and bullet-proof vests and armed with 
submachine guns -- jumped out from the vehicles. 
  What happened in the village? It turned out that six 
villagers who loathed honest labor -- Chen Pixiong, Zhou Nucai, 
Liang Jiujin, Liang Piliu, Liang Pisan, and Liang Pier -- had 
assembled a dozen or so young men, who loved pleasures but 
loathed labor, and formed themselves into a gang. With such 
lethal weapons as handguns and submachine guns -- which they 
purchased, and daggers, and home-made machetes and spears, the 
gang members made it a regular practice to stop vehicles 
travelling on the expressway by the village late at night and 
robbed the passengers of their money and belongings. The ways 
they committed their crimes were quite ruthless. They also 
openly and brazenly went into villagers' houses to rob and 
burglarized them. So far this year they have robbed and stolen 
money and belongings amounting to more than 200,000 yuan. 
  Determined to annihilate the gang, the Qiongshan Municipal 
Public Security Bureau had on many occasion sent police to the 
town to detect the gang's whereabouts. 
  At 2315 on 27 April, the police, with the villagers' 
assistance, learned that the main culprits and other gang 
members had returned to the village to rest, and immediately 
reported the situation to the Hainan Provincial Public Security 
Department, which in turned informed the Hainan Armed Police 
Corps, demanding that personnel be sent to the village to 
destroy the gang and remove a menace of the people. 
  After receiving the information, the Hainan Armed Police 
Corps immediately met to discuss ways to capture the robbers. 
It soon decided to select 50 officers and men from the corps' 
third detachment to encircle and capture the gang. 
  At 0250, four police vehicles with over 50 armed police 
officers and men proceeded to the town. 
  They arrived at the village at 0330. Knowing that the 
residences of the ringleaders and other gang members were 
scattered, the armed police divided themselves into six teams, 
and they adopted the tactics of closing in various locations 
secretly and quietly, and acted unexpectedly and quickly. 
  Soon after they closed in on ringleader Liang Pier's house, 
Wei Gang, chief of the third squad and leader of his six fully 
armed special force members, kicked the door open and stormed 
into Liang's room with lightning speed, and yelled: "Hand over 
your gun or die!" Awakened from his sweet dream and staring at 
the muzzle, Liang slumped down limply. 
  When Third Detachment Staff Li Long and members of his 
second 
special force squad stormed into the room of another ringleader, 
Liang Pisan, and turned on the light in the room, Liang was 
still sleeping like a dead pig in his underwear. 
  "Get up, quick!" The officers and men yelled at him. 
  "Hey, what are you guys so upright about!" Liang still 
thought that it was other gang members calling him. 
  "Open your dog eyes, we are an armed police force!" Upon 
hearing this, Liang Pisan sat up in bed. His body trembled 
uncontrollably, and he wetted the sheet.... [ellipses as 
received] 
  Liang Jiujin was not yet asleep. He sensed the movements 
outside and he realized something had gone wrong. Hurriedly he 
put on his clothes, opened the door and tried to flee. 
  "Stop!" shouted Cheng Zhongli, the third detachment deputy 
chief of staff, at the culprit, when he and his squad swooped 
down on Liang's residence. In desperation, Liang Jiujin, like a 
mouse seeing a cat, dashed toward the village entrance. But he 
was soon tripped on the ground by a strong fighter, then he 
groaned with excruciating pain. 
  Without firing a single bullet, the armed police officers 
and 
men captured each and every gang member by 0410. 
  From their lodges, the armed police found a 45mm handgun, 
two 
submachine guns, five long and short muskets, and 18 bullets, as 
well as the money and other loot that the robbers had robbed, 
including color television sets, a tractor, and a gold necklace. 
The armed police had now removed a big menace for the people by 
completely destroying this gang, which had committed many crimes.

  [Text] According to statistics compiled by the provincial 
statistical bureau, our province's industrial production further 
increased in April. Total industrial production output value at 
the township level and above was 3.0478 billion yuan, an 
increase of 7.6 percent over the same period last year. At 
present, industrial development trends in our province have the 
following features: 
  1. Heavy industry still occupies an important position in 
the overall industrial production, and in particular, the 
production of non-ferrous metals smelting industry and the iron 
smelting industry have increased further. In April, the total 
production output value of heavy industry reached 2.167 billion 
yuan, 11.7 percent more than that of the same period last year. 
Heavy industry's sales volume was 2.021 billion yuan, up 6 
percent over the corresponding period last year. Its production 
and marketing rate was 93.2 percent. 
  2. The production of summer beverages, like beer and 
alcohol-free soft drinks, has developed more rapidly. The 
production of energy products also has maintained a better 
momentum. In April, generated energy was 1.37 billion kwh, an 
increase of 36.3 over the same period last year. Production 
output of raw coal was 4.09 million tons, 17.4 percent more than 
that of the same period last year. Production output of natural 
gas was 26.36 million cubic meter, up 400 percent over the 
corresponding period last year. 
  3. Production costs have increased by a wide margin, and the 
deficit situation remains serious. According to the results of 
investigations made in 201 large and medium-sized industrial 
enterprises, there were 123 deficit-making enterprises, 
accounting for 61 percent of the total. The newly increased 
deficits occurred mainly in the machinery, chemical, and light 
industrial sectors. Therefore, they face a very strenuous task 
of turning from deficits to profits.

  [Text] Hefei, May 10 (XINHUA) -- China will strengthen the 
registration of foreign-funded enterprises to ensure their 
healthy development and adopt measures to help them solve 
problems quickly. 
  The number of foreign-funded enterprises has surpassed 
170,000 in China and is still expanding. 
  "They have brought us advanced technology, equipment and 
funds we need badly, and are playing an increasing role in 
China's national economic development," an official of the State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce said. 
  "However," he pointed out, "some localities have paid 
attention only to the number and not to the quality of 
foreign-funded enterprises, some have violated the state law and 
regulations to offer extra preferential policies to go along 
with the other side, and some even have under evaluated the 
property of our state enterprises in order to set up joint 
ventures with foreign business people or sell the property to 
them." 
  He disclosed that a small number of foreign business people 
have not yet registered their capital according to contract 
since having their names registered. 
  To guide foreign-funded enterprises toward healthy 
development, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce 
will adopt the following key measures: 
  -- Reinforce and improve the examination of investment 
registration; 
  -- Approve the report of evaluation of the property 
submitted 
by a Chinese state enterprise which plans to cooperate with 
foreign businessmen in setting up a joint venture; 
  -- Require foreign business people scheduled to set up joint 
ventures or cooperate with Chinese to list the actual values of 
their equipment and other materials in kind in the contract, 
with figures subject to approval by intermediary and notary 
organizations; 
  -- Require central state enterprises that plan to sell 
stocks 
or use state property to set up joint ventures or cooperate with 
foreign firms to submit a report for state approval prior to 
putting plans into action; 
  -- Require Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative 
enterprises to share weal and woe despite the proportion of 
investments; 
  -- Strengthen the supervision and examination of investments 
made by foreign-funded enterprises. 
  An enterprise with registered capital of less than two 
million U.S. dollars must deliver the funds within six months 
from the day on which it gets a business license, and the time 
limit for a business with registered capital of less than five 
million U.S. dollars will be one year, and two years for those 
with registered funds of less than 10 million U.S. dollars. The 
period will be extended for larger projects. 
  -- Upon discovery, revoke the license of and punish any 
Sino-foreign joint venture enterprise whose Chinese partner has 
replaced the foreign side in handling registered capital, 
according to the law and regulations.

<F P=106> ["Feature" by XINHUA reporters Sun Benyao (1327 2609 1031) </F>
and Qian Yonghong (6929 0737 5725): "The Premier Braves the 
Rain To Visit Herdsmen"] 
  [Text] Hohhot, 5 May (XINHUA) -- It was drizzling on the 
verdant Ordos prairie on the morning of 2 May. Premier Li Peng 
and his entourage, who were inspecting work in the Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region, arrived by car at the home of 
Alengdai, a Mongolian herdsman, in Bulag Village, Ejin Horo Sumu 
[the preceding word denotes a Mongolian administrative 
division], Ih Ju League. 
  Before stepping into the courtyard, a smiling Premier Li 
Peng 
extended his cordial greetings to Mr. and Mrs. Alengdai, his 
hosts who had come out to welcome him warmly. Using a Mongolian 
phrase she had just learned, Comrade Zhu Lin [Li Peng's wife] 
said: "Saibainu (How do you do)?" 
  His tanned face betraying extraordinary excitement, a sturdy 
Alengdai, in a Mongolian gown, clasped Li Peng's hand with both 
of his hands and said repeatedly: "How do you do, Mr. Premier? 
How do you do, Mr. Premier." 
  Premier Li Peng sat cross-legged on a heatable brick bed in 
the house. Following Mongolian etiquette, he gladly took the 
bowl of hot tea with milk from his host, with whom he chit 
chatted as he drank from the bowl. 
  Alengdai profusely praised the dual contract responsibility 
system for grassland and animal husbandry that has been in place 
since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee. He said: "Before the introduction of reform, I lived 
in a small mud house and our per capita annual income was less 
than 100 yuan. Things have got better in recent years, thanks to 
state policies and our own hard work. My family now has more 
than 140 sheep and goats, as well as some horses and cattle. We 
have built more than 70 mu of grass enclosures, as well as 
plastic heating sheds. Our 3-mu irrigated field yields more 
than 3,000 kg each year. Last year, our family income topped 
5,000 yuan, or 1,200 yuan per capita." 
  The premier asked solicitously: "How many children do you 
have? Are they in school? Is their schooling expensive?" 
  "Two of my children are in school. My daughter attends 
paramedical school in Hulun Buir League. I have to send them 
money every year," Alengdai said. 
  The premier said: "Good. Herdsmen are willing to invest in 
their children, who represent the new generation on the prairie." 
  The premier asked: "Do you grow grain for your own 
consumption or for sale?" 
  "Primarily for use as fodder." 
  The premier asked in detail: "How much wool can a head of 
sheep yield per shearing? How is the quality of wool?" 
  "Sheep yield two kg of wool per head, whereas each goat 
produces 4 liang of down. The quality of wool and down is not 
very good." 
  The premier then said in an emphatic tone: "Well, you cannot 
sell your wool for a good price if its quality is bad. We need 
to improve our breeds of sheep and goal, raise them 
scientifically, and change our conventional method of raising 
livestock in an environment that is susceptible to the 
elements." Upon hearing the premier's remarks, Alengdai and 
other herdsmen nodded repeatedly. 
  When the premier handed him brick tea [a mass of tea leaves 
in the shape of a brick], a gift he had specifically taken 
along, Alengdai said excitedly: "Why, Mr. Premier has us 
herdsmen on his mind!" 
  Not long before, Alengdai had built a brick house with a 
floor space of more than 100 square meters. Upon seeing the 
television, videocassettee recorder, washing machine, and 
knockdown cabinets in the house, and upon learning from Alengdai 
that he had bought yet another diesel-powered pedicab a year 
earlier, the premier remarked joyously: "Herdsmen on the 
prairie are leading a different life than in the past. They 
will lead an even better life in the future." 
  The drizzle linked the premier's heart with those of the 
herdsmen. As he shook hands with Alengdai before leaving, the 
premier asked: "What is Mongolian for `Good-bye'?" 
"Bayaritai," replied Alengdai emotionally as he reluctantly bid 
the premier farewell. The premier blurted out: "Bayaritai!" 
  On his way home, Premier Li Peng told Wang Qun, secretary of 
the autonomous regional party committee, and Wuliji, chairman of 
the autonomous region, who were traveling with him: "Although 
Inner Mongolia's wool output is not low, the wool quality is not 
good enough. We should adopt measures to improve quality and 
raise prices, cut down on intermediate links in the distribution 
system, and let peasants and herdsmen derive real benefits to 
encourage them to improve wool quality."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Gao Ningsheng (7559 1337 3932)] </F>
  [Text] Yinchuan, 27 Mar (XINHUA) -- Ningxia's radio 
broadcasting and television service has developed rapidly in the 
nineties. In 1993, the radio broadcasting coverage rate rose to 
76.3 percent from 68.9 percent in 1989 and became higher than 
the nation's average for the first time. In the same five-year 
period, the television coverage rate rose 18 percent from 61.8 
percent to 79.8 percent. 
  In Ningxia and particularly in its southern mountainous 
region where information and transportation facilities are poor, 
people learn of new policies and information and acquire science 
and technology knowledge mainly through radio broadcasts and 
television. In the five years, the autonomous region and various 
cities and counties themselves invested a total of 80 million 
yuan in radio and television facilities, in addition to 
obtaining 4 million yuan in state assistance. Thus, the 
development of radio broadcasting and the television service was 
accelerated. 
  The region spent more than 20 million yuan on updating radio 
broadcasting equipment and on repairing circuits. Twelve 
county-level FM radio stations have been set up, and the FM 
broadcasts cover more than 60 cities, counties, and townships in 
the region. The region's radio broadcasting as a whole, with a 
total transmission power of 268 kw, covers 89.3 percent of 
townships and towns and 57.16 percent of villages. The Luoshan 
FM station, with a transmission power of 6 kw and which will 
cost more than 1 million yuan to build, will be completed this 
year. After it begins operating, the radio broadcasting 
coverage rate in the southern mountainous region will increase 
to 78 percent. 
  As of 1993, there were five television stations and more 
than 
10 television relay stations in Ningxia. The Central Television 
Program One Network covers 74.26 percent of Ningxia, and the 
programs of Ningxia's own television stations cover 75.46 
percent of the region. All counties in the southern mountainous 
region receive television programs from more than three stations.

  [Text] Yingchuan, May 10 (XINHUA) -- The Ningxia Hui 
Autonomous Region in China's northwest has built 228.7 km of 
highways a year over the past 15 years, linking the entire 
Muslim autonomous region with 12 trunk highways. 
  According to an official from the region's communications 
department, Ningxia is now cobwebbed with 8,300 kilometers of 
highways. The region's 292 towns and townships all have access 
to modern highway transportation. 
  Meanwhile, the number of highway bridges has more than 
doubled. Highways and bridges, particularly the three bridges 
across the Yellow River, China's second largest, have greatly 
eased Ningxia's transportation tension. 
  Better transportation has greatly enhanced Ningxia's market 
circulation. The region's rich coal, farm and sideline products 
have kept flowing towards the economically developed areas while 
construction and industrial materials from other provinces have 
helped modernize the region. 
  At present, seven large transportation projects are being 
built with the help of the state. The 1200-meter bridge in the 
region's capital of Yingchuan, the most up-to-date bridge across 
the Yellow River, is expected to be put into operation next 
month. 
  Other projects include the construction of a first class 
highway from Yingchuan to Guyaozi and the renovation of the 
second class highway from Yingchuan to Pingliang. The effort is 
expected to bring the total length of highways to 9,700 
kilometers in six to seven years.

  [Excerpts] Nearly 50 people, including model workers and 
representatives of workers and staff members from various fronts 
in our province, as well as factory directors and managers, 
gathered at Xian's Liuhua Guest House yesterday to mark the 1 
May International Labor Day. Provincial party Secretary Zhang 
Boxing was present at the gathering to celebrate the festival 
joyfully with the other participants. 
  The atmosphere of the gathering was cordial and warm. 
Provincial trade union federation President Gao Yingin, on 
behalf of the federation, first extended his holiday greetings 
to all present, then gave his regards to the broad masses of 
workers and staff members on various fronts and to their family 
members. He said: [words indistinct] In the face of 
difficulties and problems arising in reform, what we need is 
understanding, support, and active participation so as to enable 
state-owned enterprises and workers to row in the same boat. 
Only this is the desired attitude of the working class, and the 
best way to turn the corner. The party and government have done 
precisely this for many years, which has enabled us to deepen 
the reform step by step. [passage omitted] 
  After listening to the speeches by some participants, the 
provincial party secretary spoke. He fully affirmed the 
achievements made by the working class in various trades and 
services in our province. He also praised their great role in 
deepening the reforms. He said: Model workers are the advanced 
representatives of the working class. They have made 
outstanding contributions to our socialist cause, and have won 
the respect of the people. He hoped that model workers would 
continue to play their leading and key role, and their bridge 
role as well. [passage omitted including indistinct portion] 
  According to another report, yesterday evening the 
provincial 
trade union federation hosted a reception at Xian's Liuhua Guest 
House to celebrate 1 May International Labor Day. More than 50 
people attended the reception, including worker representatives 
from various fronts and some foreign experts. Participating 
foreign experts thanked their hosts for their lavish

and trade, and to play their bridge role in this regard.

  [Text] A provincial science and technology work conference 
was convened in Xian yesterday. 
  Provincial Vice Governor Fan Xiaomei delivered a report 
entitled: Emancipate Minds, Deepen Reform, and More 
Expeditiously Integrate Science, Technology, and the Economy by 
Stabilizing One Aspect and Lifting Control on Other Aspects. 
  Provincial Governor Bai Qingcai also delivered an important 
speech at yesterday's conference. 
  The conference was held by the provincial people's 
government 
to study and formulate a general train of thought aimed at 
deepening scientific and technological structural reform and 
integrating science, technology, and the economy under the new 
circumstances as well as arranging for the province's present 
and future science and technology work. 
  Vice Governor Fan Xiaomei stated in her report that 
Shaanxi's 
present and future scientific and technological tasks were as 
follows: 
  1. To build and perfect a simple but highly efficient 
scientific research and development system which integrates 
science, technology, and economy; 
  2. To build and develop a technology market, an information 
market, and a qualified personnel market; 
  3. To organize and train a backbone contingent of young and 
competent academic and technological personnel capable of 
working into the next century, a strong contingent of 
entrepreneurs proficient in modern science and technology, and a 
strong contingent of managerial personnel engaged in scientific 
and technological work; 
  4. To strive to make major breakthroughs in developing 
nongovernmental scientific and technological undertakings, 
building a technology market, and building principal and 
backbone projects, to raise the scientific and technological 
achievements transformation rate and scientific and 
technological utilization rate up to and above 50 percent, 
thereby giving full scope to the role played by science and 
technology as the primary productive forces. 
  During the next few years, vice Governor Fan Xiaomei noted, 
the province's scientific and technological structural reform is 
expected to focus on lifting the controls on more aspects to 
enable more scientific research institutions to participate in 
economic operations and operate like enterprises, turning more 
scientific research institutions into nongovernmental 
institutions engaged in socialized operation. 
  In his speech Governor Bai Qingcai stated: Science and 
technology are the primary productive forces. We have yet to 
acquire an in-depth understanding of the importance of science 
and technology in practice and make greater efforts to turn 
scientific and technological achievements into productive 
forces. The province's scientific, technological, and economic 
structural reforms are aimed mainly at turning scientific and 
technological achievements, more expeditiously, from 
intellectual products into commodities and from potential 
productive forces into real productive forces by dint of the 
market. 
  Governor Bai Qingcai called on people's governments and 
scientific and technological workers at all levels across the 
province to: Be more conscious of transforming scientific and 
technological achievements into productive forces; employ the 
necessary economic, legislative, and administrative measures in 
this regard; successfully tackle a number of long-standing 
problems hindering the transformation, such as setting excessive 
store by scientific research while making little effort to 
transform scientific and technological achievements into 
productive forces, a poor sense of intellectual property rights, 
not paying attention to economic efficiency, and so on; take

<F P=106> ["Communique Issued by the Seventh Plenary Session of the </F>
Autonomous Regional Discipline Inspection Commission"] 
  [Excerpts] The Seventh Plenary Session of the Xinjiang 
Uygur Autonomous Regional CPC Discipline Inspection Commission 
[XUARCPCDIC] was held in Urumqi from 31 March to 3 April. Under 
the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line, the plenary session implemented the guidelines of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the 
Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission, and the Sixth (Enlarged) Plenary Session of the 
Fourth Xinjiang Autonomous Regional Party Committee in an 
all-round way; reviewed and summed up Xinjiang's implementation 
of the central authorities' decision on successfully tackling a 
few tasks related to the anticorruption drive in the near future 
since the Fifth Plenary Session of the XUARCPCDIC; and drew up a 
plan for the tasks to be handled by Xinjiang in the 
anticorruption drive in 1994 around the overall situation of the 
whole party's work -- seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open 
up wider, promote development, and maintain stability -- and in 
accordance with the demand set by the central authorities on 
more effectively launching the anticorruption drive in depth and 
over a protracted period of time. 
  Twenty six XUARCPCDIC members attended the meeting. [passage 
omitted] The XUARCPCDIC Standing Committee presided over the 
meeting. The plenary session approved the report [entitled] 
"More Effectively Launch the Anticorruption Drive in Depth and 
Over a Protracted Period of Time to Serve the Needs of 
Xinjiang's Reform, Development, and Stability" delivered by 
Comrade Zhou Shengtao, secretary of the XUARCPCDIC, on behalf of 
the XUARCPCDIC Standing Committee. 
  Comrade Abulaiti Abudurexiti, deputy secretary of the 
autonomous regional party committee and chairman of the regional 
government, delivered an important speech at the plenary 
session. Principal leaders of all major leading bodies attended 
the meeting. Comrade Zhang Fusen, deputy secretary of the 
autonomous regional party committee, attended the meeting and 
delivered a concluding speech. 
  The plenary session conscientiously studied and discussed 
Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech and the guidelines 
adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission. Those who attended the plenary session 
unanimously believed that Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech was very 
profound, that it was very apparent it was directed against 
those who are corrupt and has a strong significance of serving 
as our guideline, that the Third Plenary Session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission was a very important meeting 
which mobilized all concerned to more effectively launch the 
anticorruption drive in depth and over a protracted period of 
time and drew up a plan for launching the drive. 
  The plenary session reviewed and summed up the 
implementation 
of the central authorities' decision on the anticorruption drive 
by the party committees and governments at all levels since the 
Fifth Plenary Session of the XUARCPCDIC. It pointed out: The 
party committees and governments at all levels have adopted a 
resolute attitude, taken prompt actions, and have done a large 
amount of work in implementing the party Central Committee's and 
the State Council's "Decision on Successfully Tackling a Few 
Tasks Related to the Anticorruption Drive in the Near Future" 
since August 1993. The vast numbers of cadres and the masses 
have wholeheartedly supported and taken active part in the work. 
Cadres of discipline inspection and supervisory organs at all 
levels have scrupulously done their duties and worked hard. 
After more than half a year's efforts, we have achieved 
preliminary successes in the anticorruption drive and scored 
achievements, to various extents, in fulfilling the three tasks 
proposed by the central authorities. Some other negative 
phenomena and corruption have been somewhat curbed. Generally 
speaking, the momentum of the anticorruption drive is good; its 
progress is healthy; it has basically met the requirements 
desired by the central authorities and the autonomous regional 
party committee and it has played a better role in maintaining 
Xinjiang's political stability, promoting its reform and opening 
up, and protecting its economic development. The plenary 
session maintained that the progress of the anticorruption work 
is still unbalanced, that some successes have not been 
consolidated, that we must be aware that negative phenomena and 
corruption are still serious while realistically affirming the 
successes achieved by the anticorruption drive in the earlier 
phase, that it is necessary for us to continue to work hard, and 
that by no means can we afford to slacken our efforts in the 
slightest degree. 
  The plenary session maintained that the anticorruption 
drive is a test for leading cadres of the party and government 
organs at all levels and a tempering process for the vast 
numbers of cadres of discipline inspection and supervisory 
organs. In the course of practice, they will deepen their 
understanding of the party Central Committee's important 
decision on the anticorruption drive and explore and amplify 
some effective measures for launching the anticorruption drive, 
such as focusing attention on conducting ideological education 
to seek unity of thinking and to enhance consciousness of and 
strengthen resolve in the anticorruption drive; strengthening 
leadership and practically seeing to the implementation of the 
three tasks; strictly having a good grasp of policies, and 
subordinating oneself to and serving the needs of economic 
construction; insisting on proceeding from facts and solving 
whatever problems that exist to let the masses of the people 
really benefit from the success achieved in the anticorruption 
drive; and dealing with corruption by looking into both its root 
cause and symptoms, establishing and perfecting rules, 
regulations, and a restrictive mechanism through supervision, 
and consolidating the successes achieved in the anticorruption 
drive. We must continue to persist in these effective measures 
and gradually amplify them. 
  The plenary session pointed out that 1994 is a crucial year 
for us to implement the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to realize the shift of 
our economic structure to a new orbit. It is also a crucial 
year in which we face heavy tasks and a rigorous test in our 
anticorruption drive. We must keep in mind the overall situation 
of the whole party's work when launching the anticorruption 
drive; continue to conscientiously implement the decisions and 
opinions of the central authorities and the autonomous regional 
party committee on the anticorruption drive; consolidate and 
amplify our successes in the anticorruption drive achieved in 
the earlier phase; and more effectively carry on the 
anticorruption drive in depth and over a protracted period of 
time. [passage omitted] 
  The plenary session called on discipline inspection and 
supervisory organs to step up supervision over law enforcement 
to guarantee the smooth transmission of government decrees by 
revolving their attention around the implementation of the 
important policies and measures adopted by the party Central 
Committee, the State Council, the autonomous regional party 
committee, and the autonomous regional people's government on 
deepening reform, developing the economy, and maintaining 
stability. [passage omitted] 
  The plenary session emphatically pointed out that the key to 
more effectively launch the anticorruption drive in depth and 
over a protracted period of time lies in improving the 
understanding of leading cadres at all levels to seek unity of 
thinking. Leaders at all levels must take the lead to practice 
honesty and exercise self-discipline in compliance with the 
demand set by the central authorities on further consolidating 
an developing the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the 
masses of the people. The party committees and governments at 
all levels must adhere to the strategic principle of "grasping 
two links at the same time and taking a tough stand on both," 
place the anticorruption work top on their agenda, and 
practically strengthen leadership. Principal leading comrades 
of the party and government must personally handle the work and 
take steps to solve major problems. [passage omitted] Discipline 
inspection and supervisory organs are required to further adhere 
to the party's basic line; to closely revolve their efforts 
around the central task of economic construction; to subordinate 
themselves to and serve the guidelines on the overall situation 
of the whole party's work; to conduct discipline inspection and 
supervision amid the efforts to promote reform, development, and 
stability; and to create a favorable environment for Xinjiang to 
deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain 
stability through the fulfillment of all their discipline 
inspection and supervision duties so as to expedite the 
autonomous region's rapid and highly efficient economic 
development. [passage omitted] It is necessary to have 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs further strengthen 
the building of the rank and file of their own cadres. Cadres 
of discipline inspection and supervisory organs are required to 
conduct intensive study of Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping," to arm their minds with the theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to use them as a 
guidance for their work. They must go deep into the realities 
of life to conduct survey, study the knowledge about a socialist 
market economy, enhance their political integrity, and improve 
their professional competence. It is necessary to strengthen 
the building of the leading groups of discipline inspection and 
supervisory organs at all levels and to bring into play the 
functions of discipline inspection and supervision in a better 
way so as to promote the work to a new level. 
  The plenary session firmly believed the party committees and 
governments at levels will surely be able to achieve new phased 
successes in carrying out this year's anticorruption work so 
long as they resolutely implement the central authorities' 
decision on anticorruption, reach a common understanding, 
practically strengthen leadership, fully rely on the masses, and 
pay close attention to the implementation of various tasks. 
  The plenary session called on the vast numbers of party 
members and cadres in the whole region to conscientiously study 
and implement the guidelines of Comrade Jiang Zemin's important 
speech and the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, to surmount all difficulties and 
obstacles and steadfastly launch the anticorruption drive in 
accordance with the plan and requirements of the autonomous 
regional party committee and in the spirit of doing concrete 
work with perseverance, and to make new contributions to 
maintaining political stability, guaranteeing [the progress] of 
reform and opening up, and promoting economic development under 
the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
line.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Li Yafei, deputy 
secretary general of the mainland's Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that his association 
will try its best to inform in detail its Taiwan counterparts on 
the Qiandao Lake incident. 
  The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Chun'an 
County on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat and 
the robbery and murder of 32 tourists from Taiwan and the 
mainland. 
  This morning, Li Yafei presided over a meeting at which the 
mainland law experts informed a group sent by the Taiwan-based 
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the relatives of the 
victims of the incident who are from Taiwan. 
  Li said that he hopes that the two sides will take a truth- 
seeking and truly objective and pragmatic attitude in the talks. 
  He noted that the mainland side should objectively inform 
the 
SEF group of the incident while the SEF group listens to the 
report in a manner, which will be helpful to maintaining the 
interests and rights of the people on the two sides. 
  He said that the mainland side promptly discovered the case 
and dealt with it in a serious and responsible manner, which 
showed great efforts in maintaining the interests of the people 
across the Taiwan straits. 
  Only by promptly publishing the murders according to law 
could condolences be expressed to relatives of the deceased from 
Taiwan and the mainland. 
  He said that after the case was discovered, ARATS promptly 
informed SEF about it. 
  On April 24, ARATS sent a message to SEF to invite SEF 
officials and experts to come to Hangzhou to gain further 
knowledge about the case. 
  He said that to meet the demands of the SEF visitors, ARATS 
has arranged for them to go to Chun'an County to inspect the 
murder, robbery and arson site on Qiandao Lake.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Shi Hwei-yow, deputy 
secretary-general of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF), said here today that his group has 
preliminarily increased knowledge about the Qiandao Lake 
incident after the mainland experts' answers to the questions of 
the SEF group. 
  Shi said that at present, his group is only raising 
questions 
and listening to the answers for further understanding of the 
incident. 
  This morning, Li Yafei, deputy secretary-general of the 
mainland Association for the Relations Across the Taiwan Straits 
(ARATS), invited the SEF group including experts and relatives 
of the victims of the Qiandao Lake incident to attend a meeting 
for introducing the incident and the process of discovering the 
murder case. 
  At the meeting, the SEF group watched a slide and video show 
about the incident. 
  In the afternoon, the mainland experts answered the SEF 
group's questions and provided them with maps and sketches of 
the tour boat titled "Hairui", where the murder case occurred. 
  Shi said that the mainland experts answered all the 
questions 
raised by his group, which includes some experts. 
  The questions mainly involved the murderers' background, 
devices used in the robbery, murder and arson, the unfolding of 
the crimes, and the process of discovery in the case. 
  Shi said that the questions raised by the SEF group and 
experts are the questions for "understanding", not for "doubts". 
  He said that his group still hopes to speak directly to the 
witnesses and suspects in the murder case. 
  But the mainland law experts said that according to the law 
and related regulations on the mainland, only personnel of the 
judicial department and assigned staff can meet the murder 
suspects. 
  The mainland experts invited by ARATS included Ma Guangwu, 
director of the Zhejiang Provincial Taiwan Affairs Office, Cai 
Yangmeng, deputy director of the Zhejiang Provincial Public 
Security Bureau, and some other officials, senior engineers and 
senior legal medical experts from the Ministry of Public

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 9 (XINHUA) -- The 32 victims including 
24 Taiwanese tourists who died in a boat fire in east China's 
Zhejiang Province in late March died from smoke inhalation and 
burns, legal experts say. 
  Invited by the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait (ARATS), the experts who investigated the boat fire that 
took place on March 31 on Qiandao Lake announced the conclusions 
to officials of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchanges Foundation 
(SEF) and some relatives of the Taiwan victims today. 
  They ruled out other possible causes of death. No bullet 
holes were found on the outer side of the boat or bullet wounds 
on the bodies of victims. 
  The bullet mark found on the steel sheet near the hatchway 
to 
the lower cabin was identified as caused by the lead bullet of a 
hunting rifle, they say. 
  As no one survived the fire on the "Hairui" boat, and the 
scene of the crime was seriously damaged by fire and 
fire-extinguishing, more than 30 experts from the fire, legal 
medical, forensics, analysis and ship examination departments 
were summoned to the spot for comprehensive investigations. 
  Investigations and tests were conducted continuously for 
several days and nights. Three other teams of experts from the 
Ministries of Public Security and Transportation also arrived on 
the scene to conduct further analysis. 
  Experts who have conducted the investigations said that all 
the victims were found dead in the lower cabin of the boat. 
Some of the victims had hid their watches, gold ornaments and 
money under their shoes, bras and panties. 
  Partial autopsies proved that they died of smoke inhalation 
and burns. 
  The experts say that after the victims had been induced to 
enter the lower cabin, the culprits threw explosives into the 
cabin and fired into the cabin with hunting rifles. 
  Near the cabin was a large drum of diesel oil which caused 
the fire after the explosion. Later the culprits poured 
gasoline they carried with them into the cabin and set the whole 
boat ablaze. 
  Investigations and tests of the remains of the cabin 
revealed 
particular matter left over from explosives and residue from 
gasoline, they say. 
  Meanwhile, experts from the Ministry of Public Security said 
that investigations have proved that the three suspects 
arrested, Wu Lihong, Yu Aijun and Hu Zhihan, had committed the 
crime. 
  He Ting, an expert from the Criminal Investigation 
Department under the Ministry of Public Security said that no 
army man or people other than the three suspects were found to 
have participated in the criminal activities. 
  However, he said that Wu Liming, elder brother of Wu Lihong 
and an armed policeman serving in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang 
Province, has been arrested because he had helped his brother 
hide some of the snatched goods. 
  He said that investigations revealed that the three culprits 
had made premeditated plans before committing the crime. 
  Wu Lihong confessed that he borrowed 10,000 yuan from one of 
his friends in early March last year, and later borrowed 50,000 
yuan in loans from local banks and bought a motor boat last 
December. The loans were due to be repaid this coming June and 
he was under pressure to raise money to pay the loans. 
  Yu Aijun said he felt jealous toward his many neighbors who 
were buying or building houses. Hu Zhihan confessed that he had 
left his factory in Hangzhou because he felt the pay was too low. 
  The three culprits had close relations. Wu Lihong came up 
with the idea of robbing a pleasure boat last September and 
disclosed his plan to the other two, who agreed to cooperate 
with him. Later, the three made detailed plans and preparations 
for the robbery. 
  They bought three daggers, two pairs of nylon stockings to 
cover their heads with and had a blacksmith make a large axe. 
They also bought dynamite and detonators under the pretense of 
using it to get stones for house construction. They also 
borrowed two hunting rifles. 
  At about four o'clock in the afternoon on March 31, Wu and 
Yu 
carried their tools for the crime and set out on the motorboat. 
They picked up Hu along the way. 
  When the "Hairui" passed by, it was raining and they 
followed 
the boat a while until they saw there was no other boat around. 
Two of the culprits covered their heads with the stockings and 
boarded the "Hairui". Later the third one also came on board. 
  According to police, the perpetrators first took control of 
the cockpit and then rushed into the middle cabin where most of 
the passengers were staying. Brandishing the hunting rifles and 
the axe, they forced the passengers to enter the lower cabin. 
The culprits said that if the passengers obeyed, only their 
money would be taken and their lives would be spared. 
  The culprits confessed that they took the boat to 
Huangniling, a backwater area where they had planned to go, and 
threw the only iron ladder on which one could climb out of the 
lower cabin into the lake. They closed the hatchway to the 
lower cabin and secured it with iron wires, and one culprit kept 
guard over it. 
  They confessed that they first wanted to sink the boat, but 
were unsuccessful.

<F P=106> [By Stanley Cheung and Lilian Wu] </F>
  [Text] Hangzhou, May 10 (CNA) -- A Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) delegation, and officials from its mainland 
counterpart Association For Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
(ARATS) traveled from Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province to Qiandao 
Lake Tuesday [10 May] morning. 
  The SEF delegation will stay near Qiandao Lake for two days 
[words indistinct] to Hangzhou Thursday. During their stay, 
they will inspect the boat on which 24 Taiwan tourists and eight 
mainlanders were robbed and murdered while on a lake cruise. 
  SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-yu, in summing up the 
talks on the first day Monday, said only that he had to see 
relevant exhibits before he could continue to discuss the matter 
with ARATS authorities. He said that at the present stage, SEF 
could only say it was trying to learn more about the incident. 
  SEF and ARATS are non-official conduits set up to conduct 
cross- strait relations in the absence of official ties. 
  During the first day of talks on the crime, the mainland 
maintained that only three suspects took part in the robbery and 
murder and no members of the mainland military were involved. 
The three attempted to blow up the ship after the killings, but 
failed, the mainland said. 
  Ji Shaoyan, a Hangzhou coroner, insisted that no bullet or 
other wounds were found on any one of the victims. He said that 
all the victims suffocated from carbon monoxide poisoning when 
explosives were thrown into a tiny 17-square-meter space on the 
lower deck of the boat into which all the victims were herded at 
guns' point earlier. 
  He said that some of the bodies were so badly burned that 
the 
heads fell off the bodies when the victims were removed from the 
ship. 
  The SEF delegation, comprised of SEF officials, 
criminologists, and representatives of the victims, posed more 
than 200 questions surrounding the incident during the first day. 
  ARATS used a briefing, videotape, slides and question and 
answer sessions to explain the incident. 
  Representatives of the victims were dismayed after hearing 
the briefing and the videotape on the aftermath of Qiandao Lake 
incident. 
  SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu also said that SEF was 
disappointed after not being allowed to meet with witnesses and 
suspects in the case.

  [Text] Taipei, May 10 (CNA) -- The second round of tariff 
reduction consultations between Taiwan and the United States 
will help facilitate Taiwan's entry into the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu 
Ke-sheng said Tuesday [10 May]. 
  "We hope the United States can better understand Taiwan's 
efforts in pushing for free and fair trade," he noted. 
  Sheu made the remarks prior to his departure for Washington, 
D.C., where Sheu and his 30-member delegation will meet with 
their American counterparts on both tariff and non-tariff issues 
Thursday and Friday. 
  Major topics during the two-day talks include farm trade, 
opening of service markets, the special exchange agreement, the 
government procurement [words indistinct], trade-related 
intellectual property protection, Tokyo round codes, and 
non-tariff trade barriers, he said. 
  The United States first asked Taiwan to cut tariffs on 8,048 
products last November, including tariffs on industrial goods to 
below 10 percent and farm goods to less than 20 percent. It 
also demanded that Taiwan immediately slash tariff rates on 699 
items by up to 50 percent. 
  The two sides failed to reach agreement during the first 
round of tariff talks held in Taipei in February. 
  After the talks, Sheu and his delegation will proceed to 
Geneva May 14 to attend the fifth meeting of the GATT working 
party on Taiwan's membership scheduled for May 17-19. 
  During the working party meeting, Sheu will hold bilateral 
tariff consultations with Canada, Switzerland, and South Korea. 
  So far, Taiwan has held tariff reduction negotiations with 
the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South 
Africa, Hungary, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan 
among 21 countries, which have asked for such talks with Taiwan. 
  Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are 
considered vital to Taiwan's smooth entry into the Geneva-based 
world trade regulating body. 
  Taiwan was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and 
is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 10 (CNA) -- Taiwan hopes to open its car 
market to eight countries on a quota system before the end of 
this year, Director-General Yin Chi-ming of the Industrial 
Development Bureau said Tuesday [10 May]. 
  Yin said Taiwan will seek to sign a voluntary restraint 
agreement (VRA) with Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Australia, 
South Africa, Malaysia, Brazil, and Mexico on car imports. 
  Currently, Taiwan imports small cars without any limitations 
from the United States and Europe (excluding East European 
countries). 
  The eight countries will be given the same import quota each 
year, which will increase annually until 2000 when Taiwan's car 
market is expected to be completely open, Yin pointed out. 
  By doing so, he said, Taiwan will not lower its import duty 
on small cars, which now stands at 30 percent. 
  Taiwan's small car tariff is low compared to 200 percent in 
Mainland China and 140-300 percent in Malaysia, both of which 
rival Taiwan in car production, he elaborated. 
  Taiwan decided to open its car market wider in order to 
facilitate its entry into the Geneva-based General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Taiwan was accepted as a GATT 
observer in September 1992 and is expected to become a full 
member by the end of this year. 
  Yin stressed that Taiwan must enter into the VRA with the 
eight countries before the GATT Uruguay Round codes become 
effective on Jan. 1, 1995. The quota restriction measure, which 
does not violate the GATT spirit, is not allowed under the 
Uruguay Round codes, he said.

<F P=106> [Report: "Lu Ping Has Informal Meeting With Persons From </F>
Hong Kong Grass-Roots Social Organizations, Urges Hong Kong 
Residents To Participate in Work To Achieve Smooth Transition"] 
  [Text] Lu Ping, deputy head and general secretary of the 
Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] for the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, said yesterday (8 May) that Hong Kong is 
the Hong Kong people's Hong Kong, and that "Hong Kong people 
running Hong Kong" first requires the broad masses of Hong Kong 
residents to run Hong Kong. With participation in this matter 
by the broad masses of Hong Kong people, it is absolutely 
possible to achieve a smooth transition. 
  Lu Ping made this remark yesterday morning when attending a 
forum for people from Hong Kong's grass-roots organizations and 
communities to meet the mainland members of the political and 
economic subgroups of the PWC. 
  Lu Ping said that China has a saying that goes: "Roots are 
deep and firm"; when roots are deep, a plant blossoms and bears 
fruit. The masses at the grass-roots level in Hong Kong are Hong 
Kong's foundation and roots. So-called "Hong Kong people 
running Hong Kong" cannot be understood narrowly, as Hong Kong 
being run by a small number of those in the government 
departments. The meaning of "Hong Kong people running Hong 
Kong" is broad, and it first means that the broad masses of 
residents and those at the grass-roots level should run Hong 
Kong themselves, and realize Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity in the future through "Hong Kong people running Hong 
Kong." 
  Lu Ping said: We hope that you, and through you we can fully 
mobilize the strength of Hong Kong residents, so that everyone 
takes part in realizing "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong." 
In particular, from now to 1997 is only a little more than 
three years, and there are a lot of preparations to be made, so 
it is not enough simply to rely on the PWC. There must be 
participation by Hong Kong people so we really can achieve a 
smooth transition. 
  Lu Ping said: I have said that Hong Kong is an economic city 
and that I do not want to see it become a political city. I was 
getting at something when I said this. Someone has tried to 
turn Hong Kong into a base, in order to change the socialist 
system on the mainland. They also said openly that Hong Kong 
already has become a political city, and the days when it could 
get along well with the mainland have gone for good. The report 
by the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee confessed 
-- without being pressed -- openly admitting that Britain's 
policy toward China, including Hong Kong, has changed already, 
that is, from cooperation to confrontation, so we must see 
clearly the face of the British Government. 
  Lu Ping continued: It is not true that we do not want you to 
take part in politics; we do hope you care about the work during 
Hong Kong's transitional period, that you care about politics, 
and about Hong Kong's future. 
  Lu Ping reiterated that the Chinese side is willing to 
cooperate with the British side in other areas, but cooperation 
involves both sides. Whether cooperation can succeed depends on 
whether the British side has the sincerity, but no sign of 
sincerity can be seen at this moment. 
  Lu Ping stressed: Hong Kong is the Hong Kong people's Hong 
Kong, even without cooperation from the British side, we are 
very confident that relying on the broad masses of Hong Kong 
residents, we definitely can achieve a smooth transition. 
  Among those attending the forum were 200 people from the 
Hong 
Kong Federation of Trade Unions, the Association of Teachers, 
the Reform Club, the Public Housing Federation, the Federation 
of Social Groups in the New Territories, and many district and 
grass-roots organizations. 
  After the meeting, Cheng Yao-tang, Hong Kong deputy to the 
National People's Congress and head of the Hong Kong Federation 
of Trade Unions, cited Lu Ping as saying that someone recently 
deliberately distorted the speech he made at a luncheon with the 
five main chambers of commerce. In his speech, he mentioned 
that Hong Kong is an economic city and cannot become a political 
city. 
  When he said it could not become a "political city," he 
meant 
that Hong Kong must not be used as a base to change the 
socialist system in China, and must not become an arena for 
competition in the international community. 
  Cheng Yao-tang said that participants in the forum mainly 
expressed opinions on the general problems of the people's 
livelihood, including soaring housing prices, the youth problem, 
education, retirement security, and the people's well-being in 
the New Territories. Lu Ping also responded to the problem of 
housing prices when he gave a summation, and said that the high 
housing prices already have put houses out of reach for ordinary 
residents, and if things go on like this, the law of the market 
will mete out the punishment, and this will directly affect the 
people's livelihood and the smooth transition. He does not want 
to see such a punishment to take place on 1 July 1997. At 
present, the PWC is actively deliberating a relevant housing 
policy. 
  In addition, forum participant Yang Yao-chung, chairman of 
the Association of Teachers, briefed Lu Ping on Hong Kong's 
educational problem, including the proposal on strengthening 
promotion of the Basic Law, and increasing educational exchanges 
between Hong Kong and the mainland.

  [Text] It would be a pity if Hong Kong people had lost 
their confidence in the future following Mr Lu's visit, Mr 
Patten said yesterday. He was responding to a poll published by 
the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST yesterday which showed 36 percent 
of people felt less confident about Beijing's handling of the 
transition. 
  But Mr Patten said he believed the more Mr Lu was able to 
visit Hong Kong, the more people would feel reassured. He hoped 
both sides would be able to demonstrate their commitment to 
cooperating with each other to encourage Hong Kong people to 
have more confidence. 
  Mr Patten repeated his call for dialogue. "We want to have a 
dialogue with Director Lu. We want to see more work flowing up 
and down the channels of the Joint Liaison Group, the Airport 
Committee, the Land Commission and so on. "I think that the 
meeting of the Land Commission recently was a positive 
development and showed commitment on all sides to the well-being 
of Hong Kong. I think we'd like to see... the next Joint 
Liaison Group meeting as successful," he said. 
  Mr Lu ended his nine-day visit at Kai Tak airport yesterday 
in the manner in which he had arrived -- bypassing the media. 
  Mainland PWC [Preliminary Working Committee] members will 
return to Beijing today.

<F P=106> [Report: "Gao Shangquan Says Hong Kong Land Fund To Be </F>
Managed and Used by Special Administrative Region Government 
After 1997 Handover"] 
  [Text] Regarding the recommendation made by the 
Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] Economic Subgroup for retaining 
the framework of the land fund for another one to three years 
after 1997, members of the subgroup believed that some 
newspapers had misinterpreted the recommendation, and therefore 
they clarified the matter yesterday (5 May). 
  Gao Shangquan, head of the subgroup representing the Chinese 
side said: Some media misinterpreted the economic subgroup's 
recommendation as indicating that the Chinese Government is 
unwilling to give up the land fund and is going to transfer it 
to the mainland for investment. He pointed out that this is not 
true. 
  He made the following four points of clarification: 
  (1) This land fund is an important financial source for the 
Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government. This financial 
source does not belong to anybody else or the mainland, but to 
the SAR Government. This sum of money is generated by Hong Kong 
land resources, after being processed by the people of Hong 
Kong. Therefore, it naturally belongs to the SAR Government. 
  (2) This land fund will be handed to the SAR Government on 
the very day of 1 July 1997. This is very definite and well 
grounded. 
  (3) How the SAR Government will manage and use this sum of 
money shall be decided by the SAR Government. No one else shall 
interfere. 
  (4) If the SAR Government thinks that retaining the existing 
framework of the land fund for the time being is conducive to a 
smooth transition, it may consider doing so. The land fund will 
be managed by the SAR Government. Besides, he held that this 
period of retention should not be too long, but the actual 
length of time shall still be decided by the SAR Government. 
  Fong Wong Kut-man, head of the subgroup representing the 
Hong 
Kong side, explained that the dominant view within the subgroup 
did not suggest merging the land fund with the exchange fund 
because there are more restrictions on the exchange fund. If 
the SAR government finds it necessary to use this fund to 
stabilize the currency, there might be difficulty in withdrawing 
this fund. Therefore, the subgroup thinks that if the land fund 
can be handled separately, the SAR government will have some 
flexibility. This was "purely the good intention" of the 
subgroup. 
  As regards the alternative of putting the fund into the 
reserves, Fong Wong Kut-man pointed out: The future SAR 
government's financial policies remains anchored to the 
principle of a balanced budget, and it is not necessary to 
overdraw a large sum on the reserves. Therefore the subgroup 
did not think it necessary to put the land fund into the 
Treasury. 
  Furthermore, when asked about the political subgroup's 
earlier statement about composing anew the Legislative Council, 
Fong Wong Kut-man, who is also member of the political subgroup, 
said that the subgroup had always understood "composing" or 
"reorganizing" as "re-elections."

coins will be put into circulation in Hong Kong starting from 
next Monday [16 May] to replace the existing coins, local 
government information services announced here today. "This is 
part of the phased program to replace and withdraw from 
circulation existing coins bearing references which will become 
inappropriate to the status of Hong Kong as a special 
administrative region of the People's Republic of China," a 
government spokesman said today. The design of the new 10-cent 
coin features a bauhinia flower and "Hong Kong" in Chinese 
characters and English on the obverse. The reverse features 
the denomination in Chinese characters and English with a large 
Arabic numeral in the center and the year of issue immediately 
below it.

<F P=106> ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Beware, </F>
There Are Those Who Wish To Disrupt and Gut the Hong Kong 
Economy"] 
  [Text] My Brothers, 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), when 
visiting CPPCC members from Hong Kong and Macao on 16 March, 
said that we should beware of the colonialists who, while 
creating chaos in politics, conduct secretive dealings with 
"modern packaging" or "modernized means" to disrupt and gut the 
Hong Kong economy and leave a heavy financial load on the future 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Hong Kong 
compatriots. 
  This is a timely and important reminder. His reminder 
acutely lays bare an important move of the British colonialists 
before they withdraw from Hong Kong, and their intentions. 
  You may remember that in October 1989 the British Hong Kong 
Government put forward a plan entitled the "Port and Airport 
Development Strategy," which was then estimated to cost 127 
billion Hong Kong dollars. In addition to this, it also engaged 
in a package of large-scale capital construction projects, which 
will go beyond 1997, such as a drainage project, reform of road 
networks, a railway development program, and so on, whereas the 
British Hong Kong Government had just over 50 billion Hong Kong 
dollars in its financial reserves at that time. 
  In managing their finances, the British Hong Kong Government 
has also changed their usual practice, putting aside its 
long-standing policy of a balanced budget and practicing a 
deficit budget, i.e., draining the pond to get all the fish. 
  Hong Kong citizens are deeply worried about this, fearing 
that this will exhaust the financial reserves of Hong Kong and 
lead to intensified inflation. 
  The Chinese Government, thinking of the present and 
long-term 
interests of the 6 million countrymen in Hong Kong and of the 
future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, has advised the 
British Hong Kong Government several times in different ways. 
As early as 1990, General Secretary Jiang Zemin said the 
British Hong Kong Government must not do the trick of "you give 
a dinner party and I pay for it," spending lots and lots of 
money now but leaving a heavy burden to the future SAR 
Government and adding to the burden of Hong Kong people. 
Concerning the fiscal policy of the British Hong Kong 
Government, Jiang said that the policy of "spending no more than 
what one gets" should also be adhered to. 
  Especially on the issue of the new airport, the Chinese 
Government upholds the Hong Kong people's interests according to 
reason. The Chinese Government has made its position clear: 
Hong Kong needs a new airport, but the construction of a new 
airport should be in conformity with the principle of "low cost 
and high efficiency." But the British Hong Kong Government has 
ignored this, and has even raised the cost of the new airport a 
great deal after the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding. 
The construction of the airport and its railway will be mainly 
paid for with a huge loan of 70 billion Hong Kong dollars, and 
the loan is not due for repayment until after the setting up of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 1997, thus 
leaving a heavy economic burden on the SAR Government. 
  In fact, the new airport will not be ready for use until 
seven or eight years later, and the British cannot wait for that 
day. So why do they show such enthusiasm for the construction? 
We can learn something from the fact that the British Hong Kong 
Government has given most contracts for project consultation and 
major contracts to British-funded companies who charge higher 
fees. The truth is that, on the one hand, they are trying to 
use the construction of the new airport and other projects to 
spend all of the financial reserves -- and even use the revenue 
of the future Special Administrative Region Government -- and, 
on the other hand, using various "modern packagings," they are 
putting as much money as possible into the pockets of British 
businessmen. This money is the blood and sweat of the Hong Kong 
people! 
  Colonialists have their own gangster logic. Out-and-out 
invasion is claimed as help, and out-and-out plunder is claimed 
as charity. The prosperity and stability of Hong Kong today 
should be owed to the efforts of Hong Kong countrymen, to the 
backing of the whole Chinese nation. But the British are trying 
to make themselves look good. For the past 100 years or so, 
they have taken away whatever they could. Who knows how much 
they have robbed from Hong Kong! (The income of a Hong Kong 
governor is more than that of a British prime minister -- this 
is just a minor example.) Is it not clear who has fed whom 
after all? Now that it is not long before their withdrawal, 
they have begun to move away what they can, take away what they 
can, and spend and use up what they cannot with grandiose 
pretexts. Some Hong Kong people have already pointed out that 
it is easy to see from the newly published "(Draft) Regulations 
of the Airport Corporation" that the British Hong Kong 
Government intends to keep the new airport away from government 
supervision so that they can continue their influence in Hong 
Kong by controlling the new airport. 
  Such behavior has been exposed and criticized by some wise 
Hong Kong people, who pointed out that the British, especially 
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, have stepped onto a road of 
no-return against China, and we should guard against more of 
their confrontation and chaos-making tricks in the future in the 
way of finances, taxation, public construction, retirement 
benefits, civil service system, people's livelihood, and so on. 
  Following the wind and rain in the transition period of the 
past several years, the Hong Kong people now have a stronger 
sense of belonging and identity with the motherland. Never 
before have they linked their love of the country with their 
love of Hong Kong so closely, and never before have they, as 
masters of their own affairs, concerned themselves with and 
taken part in the social affairs of Hong Kong and protested 
against various acts of obstructing Hong Kong's return to China 
and sabotaging a stable transition as they are today. More and 
more people are coming together for the love of both the country 
and Hong Kong. If there are people who, risking universal 
condemnation, dare to cause disorder in Hong Kong in an attempt 
to gut Hong Kong financially and leave Hong Kong in a mess, they 
will definitely be smashed to pieces in the strong deluge of 
patriotism and love for Hong Kong. 
  Sincerely, 
  [Signed] Bao Xin

  [Text] Local people are less confident of China's ability 
to handle the territory's change of sovereignty following the 
visit by the Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, Lu Ping. 
  According to an Asian Commercial Research survey sponsored 
by 
the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST, the number of people who felt less 
confident in China handling the transition was almost double 
those who felt more confident. A total of 36 per cent said they 
felt less confident, while only 19 per cent said they were more 
confident. The other 45 per cent had no opinion on the matter. 
  People cited Mr Lu's behaviour and the failure of Britain 
and 
China to talk to each other as the major reasons for their drop 
in confidence. The poll also revealed that Mr Lu's refusal to 
meet Governor Chris Patten tarnished his image among the people 
of Hong Kong. 
  Just over 36 percent of respondents said Mr Lu's actions had 
lessened their opinion on him, while only 6.5 percent said the 
visit had improved their perception of Mr Lu. About half the 
respondents said the visit had not changed their opinion on him. 
  In response to whether Mr Lu's highly publicised visit would 
undermine the Governor's authority in the territory, 53 percent 
of respondents said it had no effect, while 27 percent agreed 
that it had. Six percent said the Governor had gained in 
authority as a result of the visit. The poll also suggested 
that the majority of people wanted to see Mr Lu and Mr Patten 
meet again. About 35 percent said they were eager to tell Mr Lu 
to keep the freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people and not to 
infringe upon them. 
  The survey was conducted between May 4 and 7 and a total of 
400 Cantonese speaking people aged 18 to 64 years were 
interviewed by telephone. 
  Meanwhile, in a forum, major political party leaders said 
they thought Mr Lu's visit to Hong Kong had not been 
satisfactory. The vice-chairman of the United Democrats, Albert 
Ho Chun-yan, said Mr Lu had been acting against the public's 
wishes rather than the other way round. The Liberal Party said 
it regretted the fact that Mr Lu was not able to meet the 
Governor during his visit. But vice- chairman of the pro-China 
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, Tam 
Yiu-chung, said Mr Lu had met people from a wide spectrum of 
society during his visit, and this would certainly help him to 
understand better the wishes of Hong Kong people. 
  Mr Lu yesterday met about 300 workers from pro-China unions 
at the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions headquarters. He 
told them Hong Kong should not be used as a political base to 
change the socialist system in China. After the meeting, 
federation chairman Cheng Yiu-tong quoted Mr Lu as saying some 
people in Hong Kong had distorted his remarks that Hong Kong 
should not become a political city. Mr Cheng said Mr Lu told 
the workers that what he meant was that the territory should not 
become a base to convert China from socialism. He also quoted 
Mr Lu as saying that the recent report by the Foreign Affairs 
Select Committee of the House of Commons had made him realise 
Britain had changed its policy towards China. "Some people" in 
Britain believed that it was an "obsolete" approach for Hong 
Kong to maintain its co-operative relationship with China. 
  Mr Lu leaves Hong Kong today.

"It Is High Time To Strengthen Communication"] 
  [Text] Lu Ping, vice director and secretary general of the 
Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [PWC], and other 
mainland PWC members made a special trip to Hong Kong to attend 
the meetings of the PWC political and economic subgroups. In 
the last few days, they had a tight schedule. Apart from 
attending the meetings, they met with representatives from 
various social sectors and found time to visit grass-roots 
people to understand how they lived. It is safe to say that by 
gearing themselves to the needs of Hong Kong people, having 
contacts with people from all walks of life and listening to 
their opinions, the mainland PWC members were blazing a new 
trail. Through understanding the real situation by having 
contacts with people at all levels through various channels, the 
PWC members, we believe, will formulate programs and policies 
more suited to Hong Kong's realities. 
  With the date 1 July 1997 drawing near, the PWC must step up 
its work. To solicit opinions from more Hong Kong people, the 
PWC, at the suggestion made by many Hong Kong people, decided to 
move the venue for the meetings of the two subgroups from 
Beijing to Hong Kong so as to increase exchanges with Hong Kong 
people and draw more Hong Kong people into participation in the 
preparatory work in the transitional period. This arrangement 
once again showed that the PWC was determined to make efforts, 
together with Hong Kong people, to achieve Hong Kong's smooth 
transition. 
  The task taken on by the PWC in the second half of the 
transitional period is arduous. The spirit displayed by PWC 
members in courageously shouldering heavy loads and working hard 
is praiseworthy. Anyone who hopes for Hong Kong's smooth 
transition will enthusiastically support the PWC in its work and 
help overcome contradictions and difficulties arising in the 
course of advance. Facts show that more and more people are 
doing so. 
  It should also be pointed out that Chris Patten and a few of 
his followers have so far despised the PWC and unscrupulously 
belittled the PWC's role and achievements, saying the PWC "lacks 
credibility" and "transparency" and describing the mainland PWC 
members' trip to Hong Kong to attend meetings and solicit 
opinions as "adopting a lofty stance." By bringing such 
groundless discredit on the PWC they will in no way impede the 
PWC's work, nor will they damage the prestige the PWC has 
established among the Hong Kong people. On the contrary, they 
will enable more Hong Kong people to see clearly the stubborn 
position of Chris Patten, who continues to confront the Chinese 
side. They will also awaken Hong Kong people who are unaware of 
the truth and the latter will then appreciate and support the 
PWC's work. This is Hong Kong's present reality and trend and 
nobody will be able to change or resist it.

<F P=106> [By Adam Lee in Macao] </F>
  [Text] The latest trick in the race to leave China 
illegally is to use a stolen Portuguese passport from Macao to 
get a Russian visa in Beijing, according to a local government 
official. Director of the Identification Department in Macao, 
Salome Madeira said her office had recently received several 
batches of stolen Macao-Portuguese passports sent to the Russian 
Embassy in Beijing. She said Russian officials, suspicious of 
the authenticity of the documents had handed photocopies to the 
Portuguese Embassy, which had forwarded them to Macao for 
verification. All the passports had the photographs changed by 
forgers, she said. 
  A stolen passport can be sold for anything between HK$10,000 
and $50,000 in Hong Kong and Macao, and fetches more in China 
and some other Asian countries. 
  Ms Madeira said the number of passports reported missing in 
Macao had declined from about 100 to around 30 every month. 
This was partly because computerisation of check points meant 
it was easier to trace people using two passports, and partly 
because it takes between three and six months for a replacement. 
  About one quarter of Macao's 400,000 residents hold 
Portuguese passports. Of the 100,000 Portuguese passport 
holders about 6,000 are from Portugal or former Portuguese 
colonies, about 10,000 are Macanese (born in Macao of mixed 
Chinese and Portuguese descent) and the rest are of full Chinese 
parentage. Until 1981, anyone born in a Portuguese territory 
would automatically be a Portuguese national. However, the 1981 
Nationality Law in Portugal stated that people born on 
Portuguese territory after October 3, 1981 would only be 
Portuguese if one or both of their parents was already a 
Portuguese national.

  [Text] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Deng Pufang, president 
of the Chinese Federation for the Disabled, disclosed today that 
his father, Deng Xiaoping, likes soccer games very much and 
regularly watches soccer matches on television. He said his 
father would be very much interested in the World Cup Soccer 
Tournament this summer. 
  Speaking at a news conference for Chinese and foreign 
reporters held at the State Council Information Office today, 
Deng Pufang and Zhang Baifa [vice mayor of Beijing], who are in 
charge of the Preparatory Committee for the Sixth Far East and 
South Pacific Disabled Games, answered reporters' questions in 
connection with the games' preparations and other matters. 
  An ABC reporter asked: How is Deng Xiaoping's physical 
condition? Deng Pufang said: He is in very good health [ta 
shen ti hen hao 0100 6500 7555 1771 1170]. He is leading a 
normal retirement life at home. The weather is now getting 
warmer and outdoor strolling is good for his health. 
  Answering an ANSA reporter's question about humanitarianism 
and human rights, Deng Pufang said: Humanitarianism is closely 
related to human rights, involving human values and issues in 
many other fields. 
  Deng Pufang: The things we do concern disabled people. We 
often underscore humanitarianism and human rights. Over the 
years, we have often advocated the need to protect disabled 
persons' rights and interests. He added: Since reform and 
opening up, disabled persons' livelihoods as a whole have 
improved a lot, but there are still some disabled people who 
have food and clothing problems. The work on disabled people 
should focus on those disabled people who have the biggest 
problems, such as whether they have jobs, have the opportunity 
to receive an education, or have enough to eat and to wear. It 
is unrealistic if we ignore these basic issues and talk about 
humanitarianism and human rights in abstract terms. 
  Deng Pufang indicated that a sincere humanitarian must be 
genuinely sincere to do humanitarian work. He said: We in 
China are doing our work little by little, and little successes, 
accumulating over time, will result in great achievements and 
inspire great hope.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Lu Ti (7627 6611): "China's Progress </F>
in Secretly Building Aircraft Carrier"] 
  [Excerpts] Military Expenditure Increases by 10 
Billion Yuan for Mysterious Use 
  At the Second Session of the Eighth National People's 
Congress, which was held in March this year, budgeted military 
expenditure increased by 20 percent over last year to 52 billion 
yuan. Everyone knows that the CPC has cut 1 million troops from 
the Army over the past several years, and it is alleged that the 
cuts will continue this year, but military expenditure has 
greatly increased at the same time. Where is the money going? 
The CPC's official explanation is that they will greatly 
increase remuneration for officers and men, and, in particular, 
increase wages and benefits for senior military officers to 
allow high wages to sustain honesty, solve the problem of 
servicemen's living conditions, tackle the phenomenon where 
servicemen's living standards are lower than civilians as a 
result of economic reform, and upgrade servicemen's social 
status, which is far lower than before. 
  In fact, the above-mentioned explanation is a superficial 
reason. This 10 billion yuan cannot all be spent on "improving 
the standard of living of servicemen." A large portion of the 
money will be used to fund research and the manufacture of an 
aircraft carrier. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Neither Affordable Nor Technologically Viable </H5>
  Construction of an aircraft carrier involves combining the 
most advanced modern science and technology. Crucial problems, 
such as ship-borne aircraft, antisubmarine technology, and air 
defense radar, are the weak links of military technology in 
China, and judged from current standards, it seems that a 
breakthrough will not come easily. Therefore, although China 
can produce 10,000-ton cargo ships, it cannot build an aircraft 
carrier. 
  In its attempts to buy one, China has already contacted 
several countries, and a case widely known to the international 
community was the negotiations to purchase one from Ukraine. 
After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, one of 
the former republics, told the CPC it was willing to sell an 
unfinished aircraft carrier to Beijing. Tian Zhen, president of 
China's Naval Command College, led a delegation to bargain with 
Ukraine, which had asked for $2.4 billion. For a "Kuznetsov" 
class aircraft carrier, which has strong attack ability and good 
self-defense capability, this price should be considered fair to 
the Chinese Navy, which still does not have the ability to build 
and organize an integrated task force, this type of Soviet 
aircraft carrier, which has a very strong combat ability in 
itself, is perhaps more suitable than a U.S. aircraft carrier. 
  But they failed to sign an official contract on the deal in 
the end. Minister of defense, General Chi Haotian, said during 
a trip to Malaysia that this was because China's defense budget 
did not have the money to buy it. Price was perhaps one reason, 
but the main reason, according to sources, was that Russia 
refused to provide the electronic equipment needed for the ship. 
During a trip to the United States, Ivan Plyushch, chairman of 
the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, was asked about the sale of the 
aircraft carrier "Varyag" to the Chinese Navy, and he 
categorically denied the deal. The issue of purchasing an 
aircraft carrier has subsided since the denials by both sides. 
<H5>  Purchase of a Retired and Damaged Australian Ship at Low </H5>
Price 
  After the negotiations with Ukraine ran aground, China 
contacted the Australian military and bought a small, retired 
aircraft carrier from them. Because it was bought at the price 
of "scrap steel from a dismantled ship," the price was ideal. 
Not only was this ship very old, but it was also weak in combat 
ability, and hence, was dumped at Guangzhou's Huangpo Military 
Academy, for the viewing pleasure of naval officers and 
personnel specializing in research on aircraft carriers, and for 
the first time a real aircraft carrier had been provided by 
China's military to relevant personnel for technological 
research. For communist China's research personnel, who had 
only seen pictures of such a huge vessel, this retired 
Australian ship was first-hand teaching material. 
<H5>  Internal Exhibition of Defense Weapons Frustrates People </H5>
  The lack of knowledge of aircraft carriers within the 
Chinese 
military can be illustrated by the following incident. 
  In November 1990, a military museum in a western suburb of 
Beijing held an internal "exhibition of the most advanced 
defense weapons," and the organizers were the General Staff 
Headquarters and the State Commission of Science, Technology, 
and Industry for National Defense. The exhibition was only open 
to senior military officers, industrial circles, and important 
political figures. 
  During the exhibition, a model of an 
aircraft carrier and models of an carrier-led task force 
attracted a large number of visitors, among them Air Force 
Commander Wang Hai and Navy Deputy Commander Li Jing, as well as 
Ding Henggao, Xie Guang, and Ye Zhendai, who are respectively 
minister and vice minister of the State Commission of Science, 
Technology and Industry for National Defense. The visitors 
learned that the construction of a carrier-led task force not 
only required various technologies, but also a handsome amount 
of money. Even the construction of a task force led by a 
medium-sized Soviet "Kiev-class" aircraft carrier would require 
more than 5 billion yuan. 
  A guide at the exhibition gave a detailed explanation of the 
aircraft carrier concept and the necessary support facilities; 
afterwards, the visitors, who included the most senior military 
officers in communist China, realized that the construction of 
an aircraft carrier is never simple and that it was a far cry 
from the current technology level possessed by Communist China. 
<H5>  "Walking on Two Legs" </H5>
  To buy, no money; to build, no technology. Facing this 
reality, the CPC decided to "walk on two legs," that is, on the 
one hand, continue contacts with foreign arms dealers, negotiate 
the purchase of an aircraft carrier and supporting weapons and 
facilities, and buy little by little; on the other hand, muster 
military experts, scientists, and technologists to tackle "key 
problems" in researching and manufacturing an aircraft carrier. 
<H5>  CPC's Ultimate Goal Is To Build Aircraft Carrier Itself </H5>
  Since the 1980's, in the area of weapons purchases, the CPC 
has obviously laid emphasis on facilities related to aircraft 
carriers. As early as 1985, the Chinese Navy bought the "DUUX-5 
Sonar" from France, and used it in its nuclear-powered ballistic 
missile submarines and research on carrier-based antisubmarine 
technology. In 1986, Communist China purchased "towed array 
sonar" from the United States; and in 1988, it approached the 
Italian military in an attempt to buy a comprehensive sonar 
combat system and multifunctional control board from the Italian 
Navy. The above-mentioned activities were all carried out 
before the CPC formulated its long-term plan to develop an 
aircraft carrier, and this shows that from the every beginning, 
the CPC has inclined to build a series of aircraft-carrier-type 
weapons and equipment itself and has strengthened research in 
this area. 
  According to information disclosed by sources, in the 
process 
of manufacturing a series of weapons and equipment for aircraft 
carriers, the weakest technological links facing the CPC are 
early warning aircraft and air-to-air refueling. 
  During the Gulf war, the United States' E-2C early warning 
aircraft successfully directed Saudi Arabian fighters to shoot 
down two Iraqi Mirages in just 10 seconds. This U.S. early 
warning plane has since become a model for similar kinds of 
aircraft, and the CPC has frequently hinted at its interest in 
this kind of aircraft to the U.S. Government and military. But 
because of the significance of the matter, which is too 
sensitive, and out of global strategic considerations, the 
United States has never agreed to the CPC's requests. 
  With no way to go, the CPC approached Britain, saying it was 
interested in buying the "Nimrod" anti-submarine early warning 
aircraft, which was still under research. Research on "Nimrod" 
has already cost the British Government 900 million pounds, and 
the test results still fail to satisfy the military. Mrs. 
Thatcher became angry and ordered a halt to the testing, and 
went to the United States to buy readily available early warning 
planes. Then, the CPC came and said it was interested in buying 
the plane, and the suggestion was undoubtedly a chance for 
Britain to revive the project, which made the British Government 
and arms manufacturers extremely happy. But the matter has been 
stalled for several years, and there is still no result. If an 
agreement cannot be reached, perhaps the reason stems again from 
the CPC's "political considerations," and it seems that the 
intensifying political row in recent years between China on the 
one hand, and Britain and the Hong Kong government on the other 
hand, has caused the CPC drop its intention to purchase. 
<H5>  Aircraft Carrier Overall Planning Group Drafts Overall Plan </H5>
  In order to meet the need of the overall plan to develop an 
aircraft carrier, a few years ago, the CPC founded a group to 
take charge of the development of an aircraft carrier; the group 
was headed by Liu Huaqing, a former commander of the Navy and 
vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and included 
senior naval officers, such as Navy Commander Zhang Lianzhong 
and Deputy Commander Xing Yongning. 
  According to information revealed by internal circles, at 
present, the group has decided to use the Chinese-built J-8 II 
fighter planes as ship-borne aircraft and the J-6 as an 
air-to-air refueling aircraft. The J-8 II, after its successful 
landing on a simulated deck at Lushun Naval Base in April 1987, 
has been chosen as one type of ship-borne aircraft, however, 
according to information, the CPC is carrying out research on 
another type, which is lighter and has all-weather capability 
and more advanced avionics, to replace the J-8 II in the future. 
Although the J-7 fighter bomber, which is equipped with 
British-made "Spey" engines and navigational systems, the 
"Yingji 8" air-to-surface guided missiles, and the "C-101" 
anti-submarine guided missile, was a new product of the Xian 
Aircraft Company in 1987, the CPC authorities only list it as a 
naval "shore-based aircraft" and do not consider it a ship-borne 
aircraft; this indicates that the military probably has a better 
type of ship-borne aircraft under research or being built. 

<H5>    CPC Begins Propaganda for Building Aircraft Carrier </H5>
  The military disclosed that not long ago, the first "naval 
work meeting" since the founding of communist China was held in 
Beijing, where the senior level reviewed naval policy and fixed 
the Navy's development strategy for the 1990's and the early 
21st century. Within that plan, the development and construction 
of an aircraft carrier was set as the main military goal of the 
early part of the next century. 
  Recently, in order to support the arrangements of the senior 
level, relevant magazines on the mainland have carried articles 
on aircraft carriers to show support from "public opinion." 
HAIYANG ZHISHI [Ocean Knowledge] specifically opened a column 
on the issue of "China's aircraft carriers" to discuss the 
necessity of building China's own aircraft carriers; HANGHAI 
[Navigation] said that "letters and submissions come from every 
corner of the country" "suggesting the construction of China's 
aircraft carrier." This is to show the people's extensive 
support for the CPC's plan to build an aircraft carrier. A 
person in charge of propaganda for national defense in communist 
China wrote down his wishful thinking: "If we buy an aircraft 
carrier from a foreign country, we will have to pay $4-5 
billion, and this is obviously impossible. However, if everyone 
in China gave 4 yuan, then 4.4 billion yuan could be collected 
from across the country, and this could build a 40,000-ton 
medium-sized aircraft carrier for the Navy, as well as a task 
force which could fight." This may be the true reason why the 
CPC has carried out propaganda. Once again it wants to 
appropriate military expenditure from the people in a disguised 
form. 
<H5>  "Century-Transcending Personnel" Are Being Trained </H5>
  On the other hand, the training of senior officers for an 
aircraft carrier is busily underway. The diary of the commander 
of the North Sea Fleet, now no longer viewed as classified 
information, shows that at Lushun Naval Base in April 1987, 
"today, naval airmen will practice landing and taking off on a 
simulated aircraft carrier flight deck." "Chief test pilot Li 
Guoqiang has spent the past two years preparing for this 
project." 
  In 1988, Guangzhou's Naval Shipping Institute opened a 
"class 
to train flying teams for the fleet," to make plans to train 
senior personnel such as captains. The president of the 
institute, surnamed Yao, said that the selection of a captain 
for an aircraft carrier from among the ranks of excellent pilots 
was a brand new concept, as well as one which was unprecedented 
in the naval academies. The future captain of an aircraft 
carrier could not just know about ships and not about flying. 
Yao, who is a rear admiral, confirmed that this unprecedented 
method had been proposed by Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, and had won unanimous consensus 
among those in charge of the Navy. 
  As an expedient measure before an aircraft carrier is 
available, the CPC began work in 1988 to build a naval base on 
Yongxing Isle, one of the Xisha Islands, and this will reduce 
the voyage from the mainland to the Nansha Islands [Spratlys] by 
half, to 600 km. Although the naval base on Yongxing Isle is 
mainly designed to strengthen sovereignty over the Nansha 
Islands, if the CPC really has its own aircraft carrier by the 
early part of the next century, then Taiwan, across the Strait, 
will be the first to feel the repercussions, and perhaps this is 
also one reason why the CPC is so eager to build a carrier.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing urged responsible state departments here today to 
further strengthen inspection of import and export commodities, 
so as to resolutely prevent substandard products from being 
exported. 
  The vice-premier cautioned that quality is not only 
essential 
to the survival of enterprises, but also has much to do with the 
country's prestige. It is an important matter concerning 
China's economic and social development. 
  Li asked inspection staff and business executives to be more 
conscious of the importance of vitalizing the country by 
producing top-quality products. He urged enterprises to be more 
meticulous with the quality of products they manufactured and 
advised the inspection staff to be more resolute in checking 
inferior export products. 
  The vice-premier also demanded wider inspection coverage and 
a higher inspection rate of import products, in a bid to reduce 
losses to the greatest possible degree for both the country and 
domestic enterprises. 
  He still stressed the necessity of cooperation and 
technological exchanges with other countries, which he said will 
help Chinese inspection institutions conform to international 
practices.

<F P=106> ["MOFTEC Regulations on Responding to Lawsuits From Overseas </F>
Concerning Antidumping Cases Against Chinese Export Goods"] 
  [Text] Article 1. In order to safeguard the legitimate 
interests of production and export enterprises in our country, 
maintain our country's export markets, and accomplish the work 
of responding to overseas lawsuits on antidumping cases 
involving our exports, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) has specially drawn up these 
stipulations. 

    Article 2. When antidumping charges are brought 
against Chinese exports, respondents to lawsuits should be: 

    1. Enterprises authorized to engage in foreign trade 
and with exported goods (including transshipment) during the 
period of investigation to countries or regions which bring 
charges against the goods, and 

    2. Enterprises producing export goods referred to by 
section one. 

    Article 3. All import and export chambers of commerce 
or foreign-invested enterprise associations (chambers of 
commerce or associations) are responsible for organizing and 
coordinating the work of responding to lawsuits on antidumping 
cases and should appoint personnel with professional skills to 
be in charge. 
  When only a minority of enterprises produce or export 
products accused of being dumped abroad, chambers of commerce or 
associations can appoint one unit to be responsible for 
organizing and coordinating overseas lawsuits. However, 
chambers of commerce or the associations should constantly have 
a grip on the progress of the work and open the necessary files. 

    Article 4. When a certain product is accused of being 
dumped abroad, chambers of commerce or associations should 
promptly issue notices in GUOJI SHANGBAO, and those who are 
going to respond to the charges should immediately inform 
departments, commissions, and bureaus of foreign economic 
relations and trade (local foreign economic relations and trade 
commissions) and chambers of commerce or associations concerned 
in their provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, or 
cities specially listed in the state plan. 

    Article 5. Respondents to lawsuits should, in 
accordance with the requirements of the questionnaire, provide 
data and information on the products concerned during the period 
of investigation, such as prices, production quantities, 
exports, and production costs, and should appoint special 
personnel to be in charge of the work of responding to lawsuits, 
checks, and re-examinations. 

    Article 6. During the response period, respondents 
should be subordinate to coordinated arrangements made by the 
local foreign economic relations and trade commissions and the 
chambers of commerce or associations. 

    Article 7. Chambers of commerce or associations should 
promptly report respondents' names, phone numbers, addresses, 
fax numbers, and list of contacts to MOFTEC. 

    Article 8. Respondents should pay lawyers' fees and 
other relevant charges on time in accordance with the percentage 
of export goods under investigation during the period of 
investigation. 

    Article 9. Entrusted by respondents, chambers of 
commerce or associations are in charge of organizing the work of 
responding to overseas lawsuits, and they can also retain 
foreign lawyers who understand China's situation and have strong 
professional abilities to respond to the lawsuits. 

    Article 10. The chambers of commerce or associations 
can retain domestic lawyers with expertise in handling 
antidumping cases to take part in responding to the lawsuits, 
such as filling question lists and preparing relevant legal 
documents and proofs. 

    Article 11. If necessary, chambers of commerce or 
associations can organize respondents to take part in hearings 
or concrete negotiations abroad, but they must solicit opinions 
from MOFTEC's antidumping work departments in advance. 

    Article 12. Respondents can negotiate and sign "price 
guarantees" or "suspension agreements" and should 
conscientiously implement them. Respondents should constantly 
or regularly report the situation of agreement implementation to 
chambers of commerce or associations. Chambers of commerce or 
associations should supervise and examine agreement 
implementation situations. 

    Article 13. Chambers of commerce or associations 
should promptly report to MOFTEC the situation concerning 
responses to antidumping suits and existing problems. 

    Article 14. Chambers of commerce or associations and 
respondents should open files on antidumping cases and keep 
complete sets of information. They should also keep a watch for 
changes in the export situation of every product which has been 
investigated. Chamber of commerce or associations should 
summarize the situation and report to MOFTEC every six months. 

    Article 15. Regarding export goods against which, as 
shown by evidence, antidumping measures will be implemented, or 
goods which have been punished by antidumping practices but can 
still be exported, chambers of commerce or associations should, 
to prevent any further implementation of antidumping measures, 
promptly put forward MOFTEC suggestions to improve export 
administration methods, including setting up export quotas or 
issuing permits. Chambers of commerce or associations will 
submit to MOFTEC a list of enterprises authorized to engage in 
foreign trade which have a good grip on export prices and take 
the initiative in responding to lawsuits, and MOFTEC will give 
priority to them when distributing quotas and issuing permits. 

    Article 16. Chambers of commerce or associations 
should perfect market research work and take necessary measures 
to strive to prevent any occurrence of antidumping lawsuits 
abroad. 

    Article 17. When chambers of commerce or associations 
are entrusted with the task of responding to overseas lawsuits, 
all local foreign economic relations and trade commissions 
should be responsible for coordinating, in cooperation with the 
chambers of commerce or associations, the work of responding to 
antidumping lawsuits in their localities, including urging local 
respondents to respond to the lawsuits concerned and pay fees on 
time. Under given conditions, all local foreign economic 
relations and trade commissions can also be in charge of 
organizing responses to antidumping lawsuits. They should also 
investigate and grasp the situation in their localities which 
leads to the occurrence of antidumping cases, analyze their 
impact on export trade, and take appropriate measures. 

    Article 18. All trade organs accredited to foreign 
countries should investigate and grasp antidumping laws and 
regulations in the countries where they are staying, as well as 
the investigation and adjudication situation in antidumping 
cases involving China. Moreover, they should promptly report to 
MOFTEC the above-mentioned situations, existing problems, and 
opinions for improving trade administration and the work of 
responding to lawsuits. Regarding antidumping cases which may 
arise or have just arisen, it is necessary to promptly report 
them to MOFTEC and the chambers of commerce or associations 
concerned. Trade organs accredited to foreign countries can 
make suggestions on retaining lawyers and supervising their 
pleas. Groups going abroad to respond to lawsuits or take part 
in hearings should be guided by trade organs accredited to 
foreign countries and should promptly report the work situation 
to the latter. 

    Article 19. MOFTEC is responsible for guiding the work 
of responding to antidumping lawsuits, laying down and revising 
methods for administering the work of responding to antidumping 
lawsuits, and holding consultations with the governments of 
importing countries on handling relevant cases so that Chinese 
exports are treated fairly. 

    Article 20. For those companies or enterprises who 
know perfectly well that products manufactured by their own 
companies or enterprises are facing antidumping charges but 
choose not to respond to relevant lawsuits or pay lawyers' fees 
and other relevant charges and not to cooperate with the 
authorities in lawsuits, chambers of commerce or associations 
should promptly report these cases to MOFTEC, and they are 
empowered to condemn or issue critical circulars of this 
practice. 

    Article 21. For authorized foreign trade companies or 
enterprises who do not promptly respond to lawsuits, do not pay 
lawyers' fees or other relevant charges, and do not cooperate 
with the authorities in antidumping investigations, we may 
circulate notes of criticism against them or abolish all or part 
of their rights to apply for export quotas and permits. For 
those companies or enterprises which commit serious cases, all 
or part of their rights to engage in foreign trade can be 
abolished and they can be fined. 

    Article 22. Relevant articles in these stipulations 
also apply to cases of investigation started by foreign 
governments in accordance with "anti-subsidy" laws and laws 
against "market disruption" and "protectionist measures." 

    Article 23. MOFTEC assigns its Treaty and Law 
Department to be in charge of antidumping work. 

    Article 24. These regulations are effective from the 
day of promulgation.

<F P=106> [Report by Wei Xuepu (7614 1331 2613) and Fan Dashui (5400 </F>
1129 3055]: "The Provincial Government and the Provincial 
Military District Jointly Issue a Document Calling For Ensuring 
a Good Job of Enterprise Militia and Reserve Service Work"] 
  [Text] The Anhui Provincial Government and the Anhui 
Provincial Military District recently jointly issued a document 
setting out specific guidelines for implementing the 
"Regulations on Enterprise Militia and Reserve Service Work" 
which were promulgated by seven departments and commissions, 
including the General Staff Headquarters of the People's 
Liberation Army [PLA,] the PLA General Political Department, and 
the State Economic Restructuring Commission. The document urged 
all localities, in the new situation of developing a socialist 
market economy, to effectively strengthen the party's leadership 
over armed work and to properly carry out enterprise militia and 
reserve service work. 
  The document said that all localities should take various 
measures to effectively publicize and carry out the 
"regulations," strengthen leadership over enterprise militia and 
reserve service work, conduct annual inspections and 
evaluations, commend outstanding units and individuals, and 
penalize those who have performed poorly. It said: While 
carrying out structural reform and transforming enterprises' 
operating mechanisms, all localities should ensure the 
independence and stability of enterprises' armed service units. 
Enterprises -- including wholly owned enterprises, joint 
ventures, and cooperative enterprises -- which should have 
established an armed service unit but have not done so should 
establish an armed service unit as soon as possible. Those that 
have abolished their armed service units should immediately 
reestablish them. Enterprises' armed service organs must not be 
abolished or merged without approval. If organizational changes 
are needed due to changes in the enterprise system, they must be 
subject to the approval of the provincial CPC Committee, the 
provincial government, and the provincial military district. 
The document also clearly set forth regulations on the 
mechanisms of commendation, punishment, and giving incentives 
for carrying out enterprise militia and reserve service work.

<F P=106> [`Excerpts' of report by Yunnan Chief Procurator He Zhanjun </F>
at Second Session of Eighth Yunnan People's Congress on 4 March: 
"Yunnan Provincial People's Procuratorial Work Report"] 
  [Text] In 1993, the procuratorial organs in Yunnan 
Province seriously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and of the First Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress [NPC], and the decision made by the 
first session of the Eighth Yunnan Provincial People's Congress 
on the provincial procuratorial work report; upheld the guiding 
thought of serving socialist economic construction, reform, and 
opening up, as well as the principle of "grasping the reform and 
opening up with one hand and the crackdown on criminal 
activities with the other"; resolutely implemented the CPC 
Central Committee's important decision on thoroughly launching 
the struggle against corruption and the NPC's laws and 
regulations on punishing economic crimes such as corruption and 
bribery; earnestly discharged the procuratorial organ duty of 
legal supervision; strictly enforced the law and handled cases 
vigorously; resolutely punished economic crimes such as 
corruption and bribery; severely cracked down on criminal 
activities of various kinds; scored better results in 
procuratorial undertakings on the basis of the previous year; 
and made active contributions to safeguarding social stability, 
border tranquility, and to protecting and promoting a smooth 
process of the reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  The main situation in our province's procuratorial work in 
1993 was as follows: 
<H5>  I. Resolutely Implementing the CPC Central Committee's </H5>
Decision on the Struggle Against Corruption; Concentrating 
Efforts and Using Legal Weapons To Crack Down on Economic Crimes 
Such as Corruption and Bribery 
  In 1993, the procuratorial organs at various levels in our 
province continued to view cracking down on economic crimes such 
as corruption and bribery as a key task. Particularly after the 
second plenary session of the Central Commission for Discipline 
Inspection, procuratorial organs immediately took action to 
resolutely implement the CPC Central Committee's arrangements 
and Comrade Jiang Zemin's instructions on "concentrating 
strength to crack down on a number of big and serious cases" and 
"striving for marked results in phases in the near future." 
Under the unified leadership of the provincial party committee 
and the party committees at various levels, procuratorial organs 
acted vigorously and speedily, organized efforts carefully, 
increased the weight of the struggle against corruption and 
bribery, and concentrated their strength to severely crack down 
on cases, especially big and serious cases. Last year, they 
received reports on 2,804 cases of economic crimes and opened 
files to investigate 1,384 of these. Of the cases for which 
files were opened for investigation, 584 were corruption cases, 
43.32 percent of the total; 127 were bribery cases, 9.42 
percent; 306 cases involved embezzlement of public funds, 22.7 
percent; 111 cases involved counterfeit trademarks, 8.23 
percent; and 181 cases involved tax evasion, refusal to pay tax, 
and tax fraud, 13.43 percent of the total. There were 749 big 
and serious cases involving more than 10,000 yuan or cadres at 
or above county and department levels, accounting for 55.6 
percent of the cases for which files were opened. The 
proportion of big and serious cases increased by 23.3 percentage 
points over 1992. At present, the organs have: Finished 
handling 1,285 cases involving 1,524 persons; brought 551 cases 
to court involving 657 persons; and waived prosecutions in 496 
cases involving 581 persons. They retrieved economic losses of 
39.07 million yuan for the state and collectives, a 41.8 percent 
increase over 1992. 
  1. Seriously learning from a series of instructions 
given by the central leadership and the provincial party 
committee and continuously deepening understanding of the 
important and profound meaning of the struggle against 
corruption. After the central leadership issued the 
instruction on strengthening the struggle against corruption, 
the provincial procuratorate held a telephone conference and a 
meeting of heads of subprocuratorates, prefecture 
procuratorates, and city procuratorates, to relay the 
instruction and make arrangements. The procuratorate also 
organized procuratorial police, especially leading cadres, in 
carefully and seriously learning from the important speech by 
Comrade Jiang Zemin and the spirit of the second plenary session 
of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, as well as 
the relevant instruction by the provincial party committee, to 
thoroughly understand the important and profound meaning of the 
struggle against corruption and the guiding thought in the 
anticorruption drive. Efforts were made to sum up assessments 
of the work in combating corruption and bribery during the past 
several years and to sort out and tackle some ambiguous 
understandings and the passivity, complaints, and fears about 
the difficulties which once existed among a small number of 
cadres and policemen. The broad masses of procuratorial 
policemen in the whole province joined the struggle against 
corruption with a strong will, staunch determination, great 
enthusiasm, and a vigorous fighting spirit. The work in 
combating corruption and bribery continuously developed in depth 
and in the correct direction. 
  2. Upholding the mass line, strengthening the work in 
receiving reports and complaints, and relying on and mobilizing 
the masses in thoroughly launching the struggle against 
corruption and bribery. The work of receiving reports and 
complaints is a good style through which procuratorial organs 
can follow the mass line and, on the other hand, it is a main 
channel through which procuratorial organs open files to handle 
cases. In August, the provincial procuratorate convened a 
meeting on the work of receiving reports and complaints by 
procuratorial organs throughout the province and adopted six 
measures, including: Extensively publicizing the work of 
receiving reports and complaints; once again publicizing the 
phone numbers and addresses to which reports can be made; 
increasing the days and times for procurators to meet the 
masses; promptly informing the people the state and results of 
investigations into their complaints; and strengthening the work 
of investigating, supervising, and keeping confidential the 
clues provided by reports. These measures aroused the enthusiasm 
of the masses to make reports and a good trend emerged wherein 
the reports made by the masses rapidly increased month by and 
quarter after quarter. 
  According to statistics, in the whole 
of 1993, 3,248 tip-offs regarding economic crimes such as 
corruption and bribery were received from the masses making 
reports. Of these tip-offs, 2,294 were received during the 
period August to December, an increase of 240 percent over the 
previous seven months during which 954 were received. The 
quality of the tip-offs, and the rate of the tip-offs being 
established as cases, also improved dramatically. Of the cases 
of economic crimes such as corruption and bribery for which 
files were opened for investigation by the procuratorial organs, 
53 percent were based on tip-offs reported by the masses and 
many of them were big and serious cases. In order to encourage, 
support, and protect the enthusiasm of the masses for reporting 
lawbreaking and criminal activities, the procuratorial organs 
resolutely honored the policy of awarding the persons who had 
merit in making the reports and resolutely handled and 
investigated cases of reprisal against persons maing the reports 
to ensure a healthy and smooth development of reporting work. 
  3. Concentrating strength in handling big and serious 
cases and pinpointing key areas. Following the central 
leadership's instruction that the struggle against corruption 
should pinpoint leading party and government departments, 
judicial departments, administrative and law enforcement 
departments, and economic management departments, and that 
strength must be concentrated to investigate into a number of 
big and serious cases, all procuratorial organs made careful 
arrangements, vigorously launching the work of investigating 
cases and adopting the following measures: First, they sorted 
out big and serious cases for investigation. In the second half 
of last year, efforts were made on two occasions to sort out and 
investigate tip-offs to cases throughout the whole province. 
After the big and serious cases had been identified, they were 
studied one by one and forces were organized to crack the cases 
batch by batch and phase by phase. Second, when investigating 
big and serious cases, the responsibility system for handling 
cases, namely the "four fix's and one guarantee," was practiced 
as follows: "Fix the leadership, fix the personnel, fix the 
plan, and fix the period, as well as guarantee the funds for 
handling the cases." Third, chief procurators personally took 
command and directly participated in investigations into the big 
and serious cases which had great impact, caused great harm, and 
involved interference and a great degree of difficulty. Fourth, 
establishing a system for supervising the handling of cases, a 
system for urging the swift handling of cases, and a system for 
reporting cases to the senior levels for the records, therefore 
the senior departments could always monitor the situation and 
the progress of handling big and serious cases. Fifth, 
strengthening cooperation and coordination between public 
security departments, law courts, discipline inspection 
commissions, and supervisory organs. Sixth, in light of the 
situation whereby in recent years there has been an increasing 
number of economic criminals committing crimes inside and 
outside the province and then fleeing with the money, the 
provincial procuratorate strengthened unified command and 
coordination work toward big and serious cases. By adopting 
these measures, they effectively increased the strength of the 
work of handling and investigating big and serious cases and 
improved their efficiency when handling such cases. Last year, 
the procuratorial organs opened investigation files on 737 big 
cases of economic crimes such as corruption and bribery each of 
which involved over 10,000 yuan. Of this total, 75 cases 
involved between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan, 11 cases involved 
between 500,000 and 1 million yuan, and 13 cases involved over 1 
million yuan. In the second half of last year, procuratorial 
organs opened investigation files for 825 cases, an increase of 
57.7 percent over the 523 cases in the first half of last year. 
Of these cases: Some 410 involved personnel in leading party 
and government departments, judicial organs, administrative and 
law enforcement organs, and economic management departments, 
accounting for 30.41 percent of the total number of files 
opened; Shu Kaitai, a former deputy head of the provincial 
personnel department, received bribes of more than 200,000 yuan; 
He Zizhong, a former chairman of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo 
Autonomous Prefecture Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] Committee, took opportunities arising from 
his office when he served as vice prefecture governor, to 
embezzle more than 2 million yuan; Cao Wei, a former deputy 
chief of a certain section in the Yunnan Bureau of State 
Administration of Exchange Control, took bribes of more than 4 
million yuan, collaborating with another three persons; Ren 
Shujun, head of the labor management office of the provincial 
labor department, and Kou Wei, a cadre in the office, abused 
power and breached rules in performing formalities for the 
transfer of personnel, in return for bribes of more than 100,000 
yuan; and Wu Hancheng, deputy commander of the traffic brigade 
of Wanding City Public Security Bureau, took bribes of more than 
90,000 yuan when he ran a car business in the name of the 
traffic brigade, and so on. 
  When they made efforts to investigate into cases of 
corruption and bribery, the procuratorial organs at various 
levels also investigated a number of serious and extraordinarily 
large cases of counterfeit trademarks, tax evasion, refusal to 
pay tax, and tax fraud. Last year, the procuratorial organs 
opened investigation files on a total of 83 serious cases of 
counterfeit tobacco which claimed to be Yunnan's famous and 
quality tobacco, as well as counterfeit and poor-quality wines, 
foodstuffs, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, an 84.4 
percent increase over the previous year. A total of 181 cases 
of tax evasion, refusal to pay tax, and tax fraud were looked 
into and handled, up 45.5 percent. For example, Kunming City 
Wuhua District Procuratorate investigated a case in which He 
Yuanbao, general manager of Yunnan office of Hainan 
International Joint Investment Company Limited, collaborated 
with his men in carrying out criminal activities involving 
counterfeit "Red Pagoda Hill" tobacco. The case involved some 8 
million yuan and He and his men reaped undue profits amounting 
to 2 million yuan. The procuratorates in the counties and cities 
such as Kaiyuan, Chenggong, Shuifu, and Ximeng also uncovered 
four very serious cases in which tricks were used to cheat the 
state into reimbursisg tax. Each of these cases involved over 10 
million yuan. Through investigating and handling these cases, 
the procuratorial organs dealt a severe blow to the criminal 
elements who had committed serious crimes, safeguarded the 
market economy order and tax collection work, and protected the 
interests of the state and the people. 
  4. Strictly enforcing the law, correctly 
implementing laws and policies, and earnestly ensuring the 
quality of handling cases. Under the circumstances whereby 
reform was being deepened, opening up was being expanded, and 
the old system was changing into a new system, investigations 
into and handling of economic crimes faced many new conditions 
and new problems. Not only were the conditions of criminal 
activities very complicated but there were also some problems 
for which the laws did not have specific written prescriptions 
or which the policies did not allow us to distinguish and grasp. 
Therefore, the procuratorial organs at various levels attached 
greater importance to the principle that: "First, act 
resolutely, and second, act prudently, exhausting every effort 
to be accurate," a principle which they voluntarily upheld. 
When handling specific cases, they paid attention to thorough 
investigation and research, clarified facts and circumstances, 
strictly fixed the boundary between what was a crime and what 
was not according to the relevant law, and correctly determined 
the nature of the crime and defined it. To ensure the quality 
of handling cases, procuratorial organs upheld the policy of 
division of labor and dividing levels when handling big and 
serious cases; separated investigation, arrest, and prosecution, 
and strengthened internal restraint; and let the procuratorial 
commission discuss and decide collectively every big and serious 
case. When a case could not be determined immediately, it was 
not handled hastily; effective systems and measures, such as 
requesting for instructions and making reports, were 
strengthened so that the best efforts were made to handle every 
case properly and solidly and to avoid mistakes, overlooking, 
miscarriages of justice, and letting criminals go. Attention 
was also paid to grasping the strategy of struggle and embodying 
the policy of lenience and strictness. At the same time, in 
work, the principle of the "three conducive's" was seriously 
implemented. Attention was paid to the political and economic 
effects of handling cases but even more was paid to the social 
effects of handling cases, so that procuratorial work could 
better serve economic construction. Although the work in 
handling cases last year was arduous, the time was pressing, and 
the degree of difficulty was great, in general, the quality of 
handling cases was good and no big errors or mistakes were 
discovered. Regarding the cases for which erroneous verdicts 
were given during the previous several years, once they were 
discovered, a serious and solemn attitude was adopted and the 
principle of "correcting every error" was upheld, to correct 
them according to law and in the manner of seeking truth from 
facts. 
  Judged overall, an absolute majority of the personnel in our 
party and state organs are honest, law-abiding, diligent, and 
serve the people. However, a small handful of seriously corrupt 
elements do indeed exist and we cannot underestimate their 
potential for harm. We must soberly realize that the struggle 
against corruption and degeneration is a long-term and arduous 
duty, which penetrates the whole process of the building of 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. We think that we must 
not overestimate the recent achievements in the struggle against 
corruption and bribery, that we must not be complacent with the 
initial results we have scored, and that we must resolutely, 
tenaciously, thoroughly, and persistently carry out the struggle 
against corruption and bribery. 
<H5>  II. Severely Crack Down on Serious Criminal Activities, </H5>
Safeguard Social Stability and State Security 
  Last year, provincial procuratorial organs received requests 
from public security organs and state security organs for the 
arrest of 30,297 persons and, after examination, they granted 
approvals to arrest 26,758 people. They also handled 30,874 
persons who were transferred to the procuratorial organs for 
proceedings to be initiated, as well as 608 people requesting 
proceedings waivers. After examination, they initiated 
proceedings against 25,518 persons and waived proceedings for 
1,399 people. 
  Responding to the conditions and features of criminal 
activities in our province, we mainly grasped the following 
tasks: 
  1. Emphasizing key areas and according to law, we 
severely, swiftly, and harshly cracked down on the criminal 
activities which caused serious harm. The spearhead of the 
struggle was always aimed at murderers, robbers, rapists, 
offenders employing explosives, armed criminals, gangs, and 
crimes by triad societies. Last year, approval was granted to 
arrest 14,304 of the abovementioned criminals and proceedings 
were initiated against 13,649 of them, accounting for 53.46 
percent of the criminals for whom arrest approvals were granted 
and 51.01 percent of the total number of persons against whom 
proceedings were initiated. Concerning the extraordinarily big 
cases, the measures such as intervening ahead of schedule, 
giving priority in handling, and making arrests and initiating 
proceedings swiftly, were adopted to strengthen the weight of 
handling cases, improve the efficiency in handling, and give 
full play to the might of legal weapons, dealing a severe blow 
to the arrogance of the serious criminals. 
  2. Resolutely and continuosly cracking down on 
drug-related crimes. Drug-related crime has always been an 
acute area for criminal activities in our province. Last year, 
the procuratorial organs granted approval for the arrest of 
3,209 drug-related criminals, initiating proceedings against 
3,271 of them. At the same time, they organized forces to 
actively participate two provincewide "26 June" and "26 October" 
campaigns to severely punish drug-related crime, burn drugs, and 
extensively publicize the relevant regulations, cracking down on 
a large number of drug- related criminals. 
  3. Resolutely cracking down on criminal activities 
by hostile elements which jeopardize the country's 
security. The procuratorial organs received requests from 
the state security organs to arrest counterrevolutionary 
criminals such as special agents and spies, handling some of 
those criminals who were handed over for the purpose of 
initiating proceedings; after carefully examining the cases, 
they granted approval to arrest and prosecute 22 persons, 
promptly and in accordance with the law. They strengthened the 
work of examining requests to arrest people and to prosecute 
people involved in foreign-related criminal cases, effectively 
safeguarding the country's security and stability along the 
border. 
  4. Actively participating in various special 
struggles, special rectifications, and working to combat 
disorder in key districts. Under the unified leadership of 
local party committees and governments, procuratorial organs at 
various levels actively participated in the national, 
provincial, and regional campaigns such as "one cracking down 
and two banning's," (cracking down on abduction and the selling 
of women and children, banning prostitution, and banning drugs), 
the antitheft struggle, the struggle against smuggling, and the 
encroachment of hooligans who rob passengers, thus forcefully 
cracking down on criminal activities which seriously undermine 
law and order. They actively participated in handling emergency 
incidents and in combating disorder in the districts which had 
chaotic law and order, thus safeguarding social stability. 
  Integrating the handling of cases with various other 
procuratorial duties, procuratorial organs at various levels 
seriously implemented the "Yunnan Province Regulations on 
Comprehensive Management of Public Order." According to the 
principles of combining cracking down and prevention, and of 
tackling both the symptom and the cause, they actively took part 
in the comprehensive management of public order and, through 
lauching extensive and thorough mass education to publicize the 
legal system, they actively launched "procuratorial suggestion" 
activities. They visited those who had proceedings waived and 
supervised and examined the situation of prisoners serving their 
terms outside prison. They seriously and promptly handled the 
"emergency" letters and visits by the masses, fostering the 
sense of legal system and lawabiding concepts among the broad 
masses, especially the young people. They also promptly and 
correctly handled various kinds of contradictions among the 
people, reduced the destabilizing factors which could affect 
social stability, and prevented lawbreaking and criminal 
activities. 
  Over the past year, by the common efforts of specific organs 
and the broad masses of people, achievements were made in areas 
such as punishing crimes and the comprehensive management of 
public order and stable public order was maintained in our 
province. However, there are still many problems which affect 
our province's political and social stability and, in some 
places, the law and order situation is not good, evil phenomena 
in the society are still pronounced, and the penetration and 
destruction by hostile forces outside our borders has never 
stopped. Furthermore, along with the continuous deepening of 
the reform and the adjustment of interest relations, new 
contradictions and problems will emerge. Therefore, we must 
maintain a sober mind and a high degree of alertness and 
carefully strike at our enemies, punish crime, safeguard 
stability, and protect the reform. 
<H5>  III. Seriously Perform Procuratorial Duties, Earnestly </H5>
Strengthen the Supervision of Law Enforcement 
  The building and perfection of socialist market economy 
system require a sound legal system as a norm and protection. 
Last year, the procuratorial organs seriously implemented the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate's instruction on further 
thoroughly discharging the duty of legal supervision and 
strengthened the work in supervising law enforcement. 
  1 Strengthening supervision over investigation. 
Strictly adhering to the principle of "using fact as the base 
and law as the criterion," we earnestly examined arrest 
approvals and prosecutions. Except for crimes which deserved 
arrest approval and prosecution, and for which approval was 
resolutely granted according to law and decisions were made to 
initiate proceedings, last year, decisions were made to refuse 
approval for the arrest of 2,079 people and to waive prosecution 
for 203. At the same time, decisions were made to arrest 269 
people who should have been arrested but were not arrested and 
to initiate proceedings against 71 people who should have been 
prosecuted but were not prosecuted. A total of 94 pieces of 
opinion about correcting the unlawful behavior during 
investigative activities was given. The procuratorates at 
various levels, through measures such as intervening ahead of 
schedule and monitoring and supervising cases, strengthened 
their supervision of investigations into serious, extraordinary, 
and big cases. 
  2. Strengthening supervision over hearing criminal 
cases. Through going to law courts to support prosecutions 
and examining the verdicts and judgments given by the courts, 
procuratorial organs at various levels supervised the court 
trials in accordance with the law. Last year, the procuratorial 
organs raised objections to 125 verdicts and judgments on 
criminal cases because they considered them definitely to be 
erroneous. To date, the law courts have corrected the verdicts 
in 37 cases. A total of 113 pieces of opinion on correction was 
offered after unlawful behaviors were discovered during trial 
activities. Regarding the execution of criminals sentenced to 
death, procuratorial organs carried out on-the-spot supervision. 
  3. Strengthening discipline supervision. 
Investigation into and the handling of five kinds of cases were 
strengthened, namely: Fraudulent practices for personal gain, 
use of torture to extract confessions, illegal detention, 
dereliction of duty, and major accidents arising from 
dereliction of duty. Particular efforts were made to 
investigate malfeasance and "rights infringements" by judicial 
personnel, as well as administrative and law enforcement 
personnel. Last year, the procuratorial organs opened 
investigation files for 366 discipline cases, of which 300 were 
of the five kinds of cases, 81.97 percent of the total, 
effectively safeguarding the dignity of the country's law and 
the citizens' democratic and personal rights. 
  4. Strengthening supervision over trials of civil 
cases and administrative cases. At present,, there are 13 
subprocuratorates, prefecture procuratorates, and city 
procuratorates and 29 county-level procuratorates which have 
organs overseeing civil cases and administrative complaints and 
carrying out the training of personnel who go to posts. Last 
year, the province received 310 civil (economic) cases of 
complaints about verdicts and judgments given by the courts, as 
well as complaints about administration. To date, it has been 
decided that 51 of the cases should be reviewed and work in 
reviewing 31 cases has already been finished. 
  5. Strengthening supervision over implementation. 
Supervision over the conditions for implementing verdicts and 
sentences in criminal cases, and implementing policy and law in 
prisons and reform facilities, has always been given top 
priority. Last year, efforts were made to strengthen 
supervision over implementation which was not carried out in 
accordance with the law and that which was unlawful. 
Procuratorial organs addressed cases of overdue detention 
involving 710 people, discovered and corrected 599 incidents of 
lawbreaking conditions during detention and reform activities. 
At the same time, according to law, they cracked down on 
reemerging crimes such as recidivists becoming "bosses and 
bullies prison," to maintain order in the prison and reform 
facilities. Attention was also paid to protecting, according to 
law, the rights of those under detention. In addition, in 
accordacne with the law, they handled 13 cases of corruption, 
bribery, dereliction of duty, and fraudulent practices for 
personal gain by 18 prison officers. 
<H5>  IV. Strengthen Building a Contingent and Honesty in </H5>
Procuratorial Organs 
  Over the past year, in order to adapt to the development of 
the situation and to meet the needs of duty, the procuratorial 
organs mainly grasped the following tasks in the area of 
building a contingent: 
  1. Strengthening ideological and political work to 
enable the broad masses of policemen to catch up with the 
situation of developments in the areas of deepening the reform, 
expanding opening up, and establishing the market economy system 
and to continuously upgrade awareness and voluntariness for 
implementing the party's basic line and serving economic 
construction under the new situation. The broad masses of 
policemen, during various procuratorial work but especially when 
investigating big and serious cases, invigorated their spirits, 
overcame difficulties, enforced the law impartially, fought 
continuously, and made meaningful contributions to accomplishing 
the difficult and glorious duties entrusted to procuratorial 
organs by the party and the state. A large number of advanced 
figures and collectives emerged. Last year, 34 advanced 
collectives and 244 advanced personnel were commended by the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate and the provincial procuratorate. 
Comrade Yue Congkun, chief of the law and discipline section of 
Tonghai County Procuratorate, sacrificed himself gloriously when 
discharging his public duty last August and was granted the 
title of revolutionary martyr by the provincial people's 
government. 
  2. Firmly grasping clean government building for the 
procuratorial contingent itself. On the basis of 
organizing policemen to seriously learn from the important 
instructions on combating corruption issued by the central 
leadership, the provincial party committee and the Supreme 
People's Procuratorate, the leading cadres of the procuratorates 
of various levels launched self-inspection and self-correction 
strictly according to the five regulations on honesty and 
self-discipline issued by the central leadership. As regards 
the problems detected during self-inspection, these were handled 
according to the relevant regulations. The lawbreaking and 
discipline-violating personnel within the procuratorial 
contingent were seriously and solemnly handled according to the 
principle of "running the procuratorates strictly." At the same 
time, efforts were made to sort out and rectify companies run by 
the procuratorial organs. The problem of random charges and 
fines was also seriously tackled. Concerning the unreasonable 
charges and fines which amounted to 1,033,500 yuan, 944,400 yuan 
have been refunded and the rest will be refunded. 
  3. Strengthening building of a leadership group and 
training cadres. The work to elect procurators for the 
provincial procuratorate and 11 subprocuratorates and prefecture 
and city procuratorates, was accomplished smoothly as the terms 
of office of the old procurators expired. After this round of 
elections, the average age of those in the leadership group 
decreased, their educational attainments improved, the structure 
became more rational, and the newly elected procurators were 
given on-the-job training by the Supreme People's Procuratorate 
and the provincial procuratorate. At the same time, responding 
to the needs of the situation and duty, various styles were 
adopted to strengthen work in training cadres. As a result, the 
professional quality and combat ability of the procuratorial 
police was upgraded. 
  Over the past year, although our province's procuratorial 
work scored good results and some areas made new breakthroughs 
and headway, a small number of leading comrades in some units 
did not have an adequate understanding of the great significance 
of the anticorruption drive, their emphases were not great 
enough, and their measures were not adequately effective. 
  Deputies: 
  The year 1994 is a very important and extremely crucial one 
for deepening the reform and expediting economic development and 
a series of reform measures has been and will be promulgated. 
The new situation raises new and higher demands for 
procuratorial work. The duties of the procuratorial work in our 
province this year are: Resolutely using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as 
guidance; thoroughly implementing the spirit of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee; upholding the party's basic line and adhering 
to the political orientation whereby procuratorial work serves 
economic construction, reform, and opening up; adhering to the 
ideological line of seeking truth from facts; upholding the 
principle of "doing two kinds of work simultaneously and with 
equal firmness"; strengthening procuratorial organs' legal 
supervision duty; enforcing the law strictly and handling cases 
diligently; thoroughly launching the struggle against corruption 
and degeneration; severely cracking down on serious criminal 
activities; actively taking part in the comprehensive management 
of public order; enabling our province's procuratorial work to 
have a new development; and making new contributions to 
safeguarding social and political stability to ensure a smooth 
process for the reform, opening up, and modernization 
construction. 
  In order to do a good job in our province's procuratorial 
work this year, efforts must be made to grasp three areas: 
  First, it is necessary to closely center on the central 
task of economic construction and to obey and serve the overall 
situation of grasping the opportunity, deepening the reform, 
expanding the opening up, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability; it is necessary to voluntarily place procuratorial 
work under the guidance of party committees at various levels 
and under the supervision of people's congresses at various 
levels; and it is necessary to firmly grasp the procuratorial 
work's political direction, to enable procuratorial work to 
always proceed and develop in the correct direction. 
  Second, during work, attention must be paid to grasping 
"two crackdown's, two constructions, and one strengthening. 
The "two crackdown's" means we will continue to launch an 
in-depth struggle against corruption and bribery, pinpoint key 
departments, firmly grasp big and serious cases, implement the 
leadership responsibility system at every level, improve 
standards of investigation, and ensure quality handling of 
cases. When there is a case which constitutes a crime, no 
matter who is involved, our investigation will go to the roots 
and we will never be weak-handed. The cases of framing charges 
against others must also be handled according to law and the 
innocent must be protected and not pursued irresponsibly. We 
will continue to severely and swiftly crack down on serious 
criminal activities according to law, persistently crack down on 
drug-related crimes, actively take part in the special campaigns 
tackling acute problems of law and order, and do a good job in 
comprehensive management. By "two constructions" we mean, 
first, with the leadership group as the key point and with 
building of ideology and work style and building of clean 
government as the main content, we will grasp self-construction 
of the procuratorial contingent, strictly run procuratorates, 
improve the overall quality of the procuratorial contingent, 
diligently build a procuratorial contingent which is politically 
strong, professionally capable, and has strict discipline and a 
tough work style. With strengthening and improving the means of 
handling cases as well as working conditions as the key point, 
and under the support and care from governments of various 
levels and the relevant quarters, we will grasp building of 
foundations for the procuratorates at various levels, especially 
the grass-roots procuratorates. By "one strengthening" we mean 
that: We will earnestly strengthen investigation and research; 
leaders should take the lead in going deeply into the reality 
and launch work centered on the party's central task and the key 
points, difficulties, and weak links of procuratorial work; 
leaders should carry out investigation and research on the new 
conditions and new problems arising from the law enforcement 
activities, to explore new law and deliberate new 
countermeasures; and that leaders should strictly distinguish 
between what is a crime and what is not, continuously improving 
the standard of law enforcement. At the same time, on the basis 
of investigation and research, and responding to the need of 
establishing the socialist market economy system, we will 
actively explore and promote the reform of procuratorial work, 
proceeding from discharging the duty of legal supervision, 
strengthening supervisory means, perfecting the supervisory 
system, enhancing supervisory effects, and further straightening 
out the relations between the upper and lower levels, as well as 
internal organizations and setups, so that procuratorial work 
can better adapt to the new situation of deepening the reform 
and expediting the development. 
  3. It is necessary to uphold and strengthen the work 
principle of enforcing law strictly and handling cases 
diligently.Enforcing the law strictly is the central link 
in building the socialist legal system and a must for 
procuratorial organs when they discharge their duty of legal 
supervision. Handling cases diligently is the concrete 
embodiment of enforcing the law strictly. Therefore, we must 
use this principle to arrange overall procuratorial work. This 
year, we must make new headway and breakthroughs in three areas, 
namely, investigating and handling big and serious cases, 
especially serious cases; strengthening supervision over law 
enforcement and of solemnly investigating unlawful cases of not 
enforcing the law strictly; and handling cases such as 
smuggling, counterfeit trademarks, and tax evasion. To 
conclude, we must safeguard the overall implementation of the 
law, ensure quality handling of cases, and handle cases as iron 
cases. 
  In the new year, the procuratorial organs have very 
difficult 
and arduous duties but we are confident and determined that, 
under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the 
provincial party committee, and the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate; under the supervision of the provincial people's 
congress; and with the support of the provincial government and 
the people of various nationalities, we can further emancipate 
the minds, invigorate the spirits, honestly discharge our 
duties, work hard, thoroughly safeguard social and political 
stability, and make new contributions to expediting the reform, 
opening up, and economic construction in our province.

"The Overall State of Cross-Strait Relations Should Be Taken 
Into Consideration -- Our Hope Concerning Strait Exchange 
Foundation Personnel Who Will Come to Hangzhou Because of the 
Qiandaohu Incident"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 May (XINHUA) -- After the "Qiandaohu 
incident" occurred, the Taiwan authorities repeatedly 
disseminated "questionable points" concerning the incident, 
condemned the mainland for "covering up facts," and even 
showered abuse such as "bandits" on the mainland instead of 
dealing with the matter calmly and judging the case as it 
stands. Departments concerned even decided to "suspend 
cross-strait cultural and educational exchanges and activities," 
"comprehensively boycott mainland tours," and other things. 
What was more, after the mainland's public security department 
announced that the case had been solved, Taiwan's "Mainland 
Affairs Council" and "National Security Bureau" went so far as 
to spread rumors, thus deliberately deepening Taiwan citizens' 
misunderstandings against and estrangement from the mainland. 
The action of some people in Taiwan is unfavorable to the 
development of cross-strait relations. 
  The Qiandaohu incident is an unfortunate and rare 
occurrence. 
After it was reported, leaders of the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council have paid great attention to it. The Taiwan 
Affairs Office under the State Council; departments of public 
security, transportation, and tourism; the Zhejiang Provincial 
Government; and the Association for Relations across the Taiwan 
Strait [ARATS] have coordinated with each other with all their 
might to deal with the aftermath of the incident. Over the 
course of 17 days of hard work, the public security department 
finally solved the case. It should be said that without the 
great attention from all sectors and their all-out efforts, it 
would not be an easy job to solve such a notably major case 
within such a short time. We cannot but note that some of the 
Taiwan authorities had ulterior motives when they turned a blind 
eye to such efforts and went about stirring up Taiwan 
compatriots' resentment against the mainland. 
  After over 40 years of separation, the personnel contacts 
and 
trade and economic exchanges between the two sides of the strait 
are not only conducive to the development of cross-strait 
relations but also benefit compatriots on both sides during 
their exchanges. In the past few years, the exchanges and 
contacts between people on both sides have been growing 
frequent. The number of Taiwan compatriots coming to the 
mainland for tours, sightseeing, investment, and various kinds 
of exchanges and activities increases by the day. Taiwan 
compatriots have altogether made over 5 million visits to the 
mainland. The mainland has attached importance to cross-strait 
relations, cross-strait exchanges and contacts, and the 
guarantee of the rights and interests of the broad masses of 
Taiwan compatriots; the safety of the lives and property of 
Taiwan compatriots touring the mainland is protected by the law. 
  Of course, there have been some incidents causing serious 
losses of lives and property of people on both sides of the 
strait in recent years. We maintain that the fundamental 
experience, as well as the fundamental attitude, in properly 
handling such types of individual incidents should take into 
consideration the overall state of developing cross-strait 
relations and maintaining the legitimate rights and interests of 
people on both sides; approach these incidents objectively, 
calmly, and practically; and never seize on the incident to 
exaggerate matters and deliberately harm cross-strait relations 
as well as the feelings of people on both sides. The mainland 
has been doing exactly this. In 1990, two incidents caused the 
deaths of 46 mainland compatriots during the repatriation of 
mainland fishermen by the relevant departments of Taiwan, and in 
recent years, Taiwan's military police repeatedly fired at and 
shelled mainland fishing boats in the Taiwan Strait, causing 
several casualties. Can it be said that the families of the 
dead mainland compatriots felt no grief and indignation? 
However, when the mainland handled these incidents, it assumed 
the attitude of taking cross-strait relations into account so 
that cross-strait relations did not regress, and the feelings of 
people on both sides thus were not hurt because of the 
aforementioned incidents. This has constituted a sharp contrast 
to the Taiwan authorities' attitude in handling the Qiandaohu 
incident. 
  As far as the Qiandaohu incident is concerned, it should be 
normal that families of Taiwan compatriots and relevant 
departments in Taiwan might have different opinions and views on 
the handling of the victimized Taiwan compatriots at the 
beginning of the case. In an attitude of giving priority to the 
fundamental interests of people of both sides and through 
patient communication and coordination, however, it is not 
difficult to solve the problem rationally. As for the case, the 
principle of "judging the criminal case as it stands" must be 
upheld. The case could be solved promptly or slowly, and it is 
certain that the public security department will investigate the 
case thoroughly and catch the real culprits. This is not only 
an issue concerning the protection of Taiwan compatriots' rights 
and interests but also is a measure that the mainland must take 
to ensure social order. The correct action for the Taiwan 
authorities should be consoling the victims' relatives, so how 
could they intentionally take advantage of their grief and 
sorrow to stir up people's resentment? Moreover, such types of 
incident are not the fault of cross-strait exchanges, and people 
on the two sides will not, and are unlikely to, stop their 
contacts and tours because of an accidental criminal case. The 
Taiwan authorities, however, wanted to suspend this and hold 
that on the pretext of this incident, in an effort to harm 
cross-strait relations. 
  It can be seen that because of different social systems on 
the two sides, plus 30 to 40 years of separation, there are some 
differences in their concepts and measures for approaching 
problems. But this does not matter. As long as the two sides 
hold frequent contacts, including contacts of high-ranking 
personnel such as holding the second Wang Daohan-Gu Zhenfu [Ku 
Chen-fu] talks, based on the common belief of promoting the 
development of cross-strait relations, such misunderstandings 
can be eliminated completely, and their common ground can be 
enhanced. Now, the ARATS has once again invited personnel of 
the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] and its experts to Hangzhou 
to hear the briefing by investigators of the case on the case's 
details. The ARATS has also agreed, in principle, to exchange 
opinions with the SEF on incidents involving the safety and the 
losses of lives and property of compatriots on the two sides in 
the course of cross-strait exchanges in recent years, and it has 
put forward specific suggestions. This is an important move to 
intensify communication, eliminate the negative effect caused by 
the Qiandaohu incident, and develop cross-strait relations. We 
hope that both of them will make earnest efforts to develop 
cross-strait relations, and we sincerely hope that the SEF 
personnel will depart for the mainland as soon as possible and, 
taking the overall state of cross-strait relations into 
consideration, will further eliminate the misunderstanding and 
estrangement through understanding and make contributions to 
maintaining and developing cross-strait relations.

the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council of 
the PRC, by unidentified Television Broadcasts Limited reporter 
and with Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten by Television 
Broadcasts Limited reporter Jenny Lam; places and dates not 
given; from the "Lu Ping and Chris Patten" special program--Lu 
Ping and unidentified reporter speak in Mandarin; Chris Patten 
and Lam speak in English] 
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Lu] We feel that the British 
Hong Kong Government has closed the door on contact with the 
Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] too tight. We feel there is no 
need to do so. Therefore, under such circumstances, I, as vice 
chairman of the PWC, and the Governor of Hong Kong, who should 
be considered the head of Hong Kong's civil service, since he 
does not allow contacts between civil servants and the PWC, what 
is the basis for me, a member of the PWC, to have contacts with 
him? [sentence as heard] 
  [Patten] I must say that like the overwhelming majority of 
people in Hong Kong, like a number of members of the PWC, I 
think it is a great pity that we are, as it were, communicating 
through television, rather than sitting down at the table 
talking to one another. [end recording] 
  [Anchorman Yuan Chi-wei] Good evening. Lu Ping, director of 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the Chinese State 
Council, has been visiting Hong Kong in the capacity of 
secretary general and vice chairman of the PWC. Though Hong 
Kong Governor Chris Patten said time and again that he is 
willing to meet Lu Ping at any time, Lu Ping has consistently 
refused to meet him. However, Director Lu Ping and Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten granted separate exclusive interviews to 
the Information Department of Hong Kong Television Broadcasts 
Limited and expressed their opinions on some issues in dispute 
between China and Britain. Lu Ping reiterated that one of the 
main reasons why he refused to meet Chris Patten is that the 
British side barred civil servants from meeting the PWC. But 
Patten responded by saying: 
  [Begin recording] [Patten] I repeat we are not against 
giving information to the PWC. But the PWC is China's creation, 
China's appointment. The Joint Liaison Group is the result of 
an agreement enshrined in a treaty between Britain and China, 
which is supposed to be working in the interests of Hong Kong. 
Why seek to replicate that if that is the purpose? What we 
want to do is to ensure that China and Britain work in that 
cooperative spirit which the Joint Declaration commits us to. 
  [Lu] We have an old saying in China, which goes: "Listen to 
his words and watch his deeds." You should take some action to 
prove that you are truly willing to cooperate with the Chinese 
side in solving these problems. Only when this happens can we 
have a basis for talks. That is why we now suggest establishing 
some contacts through various other channels. 
  [Patten] Here we are in a position in which we have got 
agreed channels between Hong Kong and China and Britain, agreed 
channels which, alas, have not been working terribly well. 
People in Hong Kong, I think, scratch their heads about why it 
is that after all these months, years we have not got an airport 
agreement, why we are not making more progress on things like 
the localization and adaptation of laws, why we have not got an 
agreement on the container terminal, and so on. And I think it 
is imperative that we get the existing channels to work. I am 
not against giving information to the PWC. We give information 
to all sorts of groups. 
  [Lu] Initially, our economic subgroup made an appointment 
with the president of the Kowloon-Canton Railway [KCR] to tell 
us something about the company's development strategy. The main 
reason we wanted to know its development strategy is to find out 
how it can dovetail with the mainland railway development 
strategy. 
  As far as we know, the existing railway planning in Hong 
Kong 
does not reflect consideration on how to connect with the 
mainland railway system. They have a plan for stretching into 
the territory of Shenzhen via Huanggang; but this will not work, 
because according to Shenzhen's plan, Huanggang will become an 
urban center of Shenzhen, which cannot possibly have a railway 
cutting across it. In such a situation, the two sides should 
coordinate and cooperate with each other. This is the very 
reason we invited the KCR president to explain this matter. 
  First, he agreed to come and the time and place were also 
fixed. But just now we were told he was not coming. The KCR 
president is not a civil servant; he cannot be counted as a 
civil servant. If someone in the capacity of the Kowloon-Canton 
Railway Corporation president is unwilling to have contacts with 
us, how can you convince us that the British side is willing to 
cooperate with the Chinese side in other fields? 
  [Patten] If Director Lu Ping had wanted to talk about 
infrastructure, I would have been delighted to do so. We will 
shortly want to talk to the Chinese authorities about the 
outcome of our railway development strategy, which is absolutely 
vital to the communication links of Hong Kong in the future. I 
am bound to say that the first I heard about a meeting with the 
head of the KCR was when I heard what Director Lu Ping had said, 
but I do not know any more details about the alleged KCR meeting. 
  [Lu] As I said, the Hong Kong Government's attitude toward 
the PWC is not exactly one of friendliness. We once invited 
officials of the Hong Kong Government to the PWC to explain to 
us the draft regulations of the Airport Authority that they had 
put forward. The main purpose of our invitation was that the 
PWC wished to help bring the airport talks to an early start and 
to an early agreement by discussing the draft regulations of the 
Airport Authority. But after we read the regulations, we were 
not quite clear about some of them, about why they were written 
in certain ways, so we wished that the Hong Kong side could 
explain to us. The main purpose was to promote the airport 
talks. Very unfortunately, however, the Hong Kong side barred 
its civil servants from having contacts with us at the PWC. 
  [Patten] Because at the moment, we put enough burdens on 
the civil service, trying to get, for example, the existing 
channels to work better. Civil servants also have to report to 
Legco [Legislative Council], which is the body that represents 
the people of Hong Kong. 
  [Lu] As you know, to reach an agreement on any issue, the 
mutual understanding and accommodation that you mentioned is 
necessary. Mutual understanding and accommodation means both of 
us give in a bit, after which our two sides can reach an 
agreement. It will not work if only one side, one-way traffic 
[preceding three words in English] is relied on. We have made 
concessions on many issues. For example, on the financing 
arrangements for the airport, we have made big concessions. 
[end recording] 
  [Yuan] Lu Ping kept saying that because the present 
atmosphere is not good, it is not the right time to meet Chris 
Patten. But Patten said that if the atmosphere is not good, the 
best thing to do is to sit down and talk, so as to improve the 
atmosphere. But Lu Ping said one should be more realistic. 
  [Begin recording] [Lu] If we talk, we should talk in a 
cooperative atmosphere in accordance with the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the New Airport. The purpose of my meeting 
with the Governor of Hong Kong would mainly be to talk about how 
to achieve a smooth transition. This requires a cooperative 
atmosphere and a basis on which our talks can yield some 
results. If our talks cannot bring any results, I do not think 
we should waste our time. If the two of us talk for a long time 
and then meet you when we come out, you will ask us if we got 
anywhere after the long talk, and we will say we got nowhere. 
This will be a big disappointment for the people of Hong Kong. 
  [Patten] He talked to you in the week about the atmosphere 
not being conducive to a meeting. If you do not have a good 
atmosphere, the best thing to do is to have a meeting to try to 
make the atmosphere better. I am absolutely sure that the 
overwhelming majority of people in Hong Kong who want us to meet 
and want us to talk these things through in a sensible and 
reasonable way will in due course have their ambitions met, 
because if we are serious about cooperation and the interests of 
Hong Kong, then we have got at some stage to sit round the table 
and then work things out together. 
  [Lu] I think we should be more realistic and the two sides 
should create a better atmosphere. As far as we are concerned, 
the invitations we extended to the Hong Kong Government still 
stand. The PWC's door is always open. The question now is 
whether or not the Hong Kong Government is willing to open this 
door. 
  [Patten] It is a body appointed by Chinese officials to 
advise Chinese officials. Unlike the Joint Liaison Group, it is 
not a result of an agreement between two sovereign powers, 
similarly the Land Commission, similarly the Airport Committee. 
And unlike the Legislative Council, it is not a body which 
represents public opinion right across the board in Hong Kong. 
[end recording] 
  [Yuan] Coming up next is the second part of this program on 
how Lu Ping and Chris Patten look at the Xi Yang incident and 
whether or not the two of them will have a chance to meet each 
other in the future. Stay with us. [at this point program goes 
to commercial break] 
  During our interviews with them, both Lu Ping and Chris 
Patten were asked about the Xi Yang incident. Our reporter 
asked Lu Ping a question about the Xi Yang incident causing the 
people of Hong Kong to worry about the freedom of the press. 
  [Begin recording] [Lu] This is not the case. It has 
nothing to do with Hong Kong's freedom of the press whatsoever, 
because Xi Yang committed the crime within the territory of 
China. Since his crime was committed within China's territory, 
it of course was handled according to China's law. China's law 
is of course not entirely the same as Hong Kong's law. Perhaps, 
if he had committed the crime in Hong Kong, it could have been 
handled differently. But he committed the crime in China's 
territory. No matter who you are, you must observe China's law 
when you are on the land of China. It does not apply to Hong 
Kong people only. If a U.S. citizen commits a crime in China's 
territory, it will also be handled according to China's law. 
This is perfectly justified. So it has nothing to do with Hong 
Kong's freedom of the press at all. It would have been the same 
problem if it had been a U.S. reporter or a British reporter. 
  [Patten] We are not seeking to interfere with somebody 
else's judicial system, not a bit of it. But there was genuine 
surprise in Hong Kong at a sentence handed out to somebody who 
worked for a Hong Kong newspaper for a story which apparently 
appeared on the front page of another Peking-supported newspaper 
in Hong Kong on the same day. And there was great surprise at 
the severity of the sentence for disclosing economic 
information, exactly the sort of thing which helps the Hong Kong 
stock market to spin round day after day. But what we have 
concentrated on is not any of that. What we concentrated on is 
a simple issue: It is very important that journalists in Hong 
Kong know precisely the rules and regulations which they have to 
keep to if they are going to operate reasonably in China; and 
what we do not want is the impression to be created that in 
order, perhaps, to get Hong Kong journalists to write things 
that they perhaps do not really feel or to censor themselves, 
exemplary sentences are going to be handed out, for reasons 
which people cannot understand. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Today, many people in Hong Kong are 
requesting a special amnesty from the Chinese Government for Xi 
Yang. Is such an amnesty possible? 
  [Lu] This is not within my authority. As far as I know, 
there is no provision on special amnesty in China's 
Constitution. No, there is none. 
  [Patten] I am surprised that senior Chinese officials do not 
understand why this case has caused so much concern in Hong 
Kong. Not just a minority that have been worried about it, nor 
just a minority who have been worried about other things that 
have happened in China. It goes across the community. 
  [Lam] Governor, what is your government willing to do to 
safeguard press freedom; for example, the freedom to 
information. And the demand from legislators like Christine Loh, 
do you go for that? 
  [Patten] Well, what we are doing at the moment is looking at 
the suggestions in Christine Loh's bill. We will be responding 
to that very soon and we are also committed to reviewing our 
existing legislation to remove from it provisions which may be 
used by others to abuse press freedom. 
  [Reporter] Some Hong Kong reporters cannot go to Qiandao Hu 
to cover the incident. Is there any explanation? 
  [Lu] As to this issue, I personally feel that it does not 
seem necessary for Hong Kong reporters to boycott news gathering 
in China. I do not see it as necessary. What is the point? 
They are two different things. Why do you have to boycott news 
gathering in China? 
  [Reporter] China rejected their request to cover news in 
China. Was it a retaliatory gesture? 
  [Lu] It is not an issue of retaliation. It is common sense 
that since you have boycotted gathering news in China, why do 
you still want to come? It is okay if you send other reporters 
in. You boycotted, so let someone else take your place. We 
still welcome them to cover news. 
  [Reporter] In that case.... 
  [Lu] You do not have to come yourself, do you? 
  [Reporter] Does it mean that those who once said they would 
boycott news gathering in China will be permanently barred from 
entering the mainland to cover news? 
  [Lu] No, no. Doesn't your boycott also have a timetable? 
To the end of May, I heard? I do not know. I am not quite 
sure. Is it true that the boycott will continue to the end of 
May? Isn't there a deadline, reporters? [end recording] 
  [Yuan] The biggest issue in dispute between China and 
Britain now is Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's constitutional 
reform proposals. Our reporter asked Lu Ping if the Legislative 
Council amends the proposals so that they are in line with the 
Basic Law, will they be acceptable? 
  [Begin recording] [Lu] This is absolutely impossible, 
because there is already an understanding between the two sides 
on how the first government should be formed, that is, the 
Chinese side and the British side should reach an agreement 
through diplomatic channels. No agreement can be reached 
between China and Britain unless it is through diplomatic 
channels. This is not for the Legislative Council to decide. 
It is not for the Legislative Council to lead the Chinese side 
and the British side by the nose. To say the least, the Chinese 
side will not accept being led by the nose by the Hong Kong 
Legislative Council. Therefore, the Chinese side will not 
acknowledge any decision adopted by the Legislative Council. 
This is certain. 
  [Reporter] These days, we in Hong Kong are getting a clear 
message that the three-tier councils must be disbanded and 
reorganized in 1997. But why is the Chinese side so firm on 
this issue and why is this attitude made known even before the 
Hong Kong Legislative Council passes any election proposal? 
  [Lu] We did not make known this attitude just now. 
  [Reporter] But now.... 
  [Lu] After the British side shut the door tight on the 
arrangements for 1994-95 elections and refused carry on with the 
talks with us, we declared our attitude then. This is not a new 
issue. As you should know, in 1997, the kind of change that 
will take place here is not like what happens when the British 
Conservative Party steps down and the Labor Party goes into 
power. It will be a shift from one government to another. 
Normally, under such circumstances, it stands to reason that a 
new government, new legislature, and new judicial body will be 
formed. This is only normal. We adopted the "through train" 
arrangement because it is a special measure. Strictly speaking, 
everything should start anew and setting up a separate kitchen 
should apply to everything. But for the sake of smooth 
transition, we adopted this special measure, namely, the 
"through train" option. Yet this requires a basis, which is the 
British side's cooperation with us and convergence of the 
composition of the last Legislative Council with the provisions 
of the Basic Law. 
  [Patten] Well, there are some things which are in their 
sovereign power which I do not deny at all, though of course I 
would hope they would operate within the terms of their 
international treaty obligations as well: In this case, the 
Joint Declaration. But they can do all sorts of things after 
1997 if they want. What they have to ask themselves is whether 
those things are in the interests of Hong Kong and whether those 
things will help to secure the hearts and minds of the people of 
Hong Kong. 
  [Reporter] Recently, a number of recommendations raised at 
the discussions of the PWC have caused much controversy among 
the people of Hong Kong. The first recommendation is that civil 
servants should make it clear whether or not they want to stay 
in their positions beyond 1997. The more recent one is the 
extension of the operation of the land fund. Do these two 
recommendations indicate that those at the PWC or its members do 
not have a good idea of Hong Kong's reality or the agreements 
previously reached between China and Britain? 
  [Lu] No. This is a sheer misunderstanding. It does not 
mean that the PWC members do not have a good idea of Hong Kong's 
conditions. As far as I know, they did not put it that way and 
the PWC did not discuss it like that. But how did the question 
come up? Well, Cheng Yu-sho conducted a survey, a poll, didn't 
he? The results claimed that by 1997, many civil servants, 
especially senior civil servants and administrative officers, 
will resign. So we said if it is true that so many 
administrative officers will quit, there will be many things 
unattended to. What should we do? 
  In fact, Cheng Yu-sho's survey was not comprehensive and his 
results were impossible. 
  At that point, it was suggested that if a civil servant is 
not willing to go on to work in the Special Administrative 
Region [SAR] Government in 1997, he should notify the 
Preparatory Committee or other authorities beforehand. He 
should do it himself, making it clear that he is not going to 
carry on beyond 1997. This way, the chief executive or other 
chief officials can look for someone at an early stage to 
succeed him, so that the government's operation will not be 
affected or come to a stop. This is how we put it and how we 
discussed it. I do not know why stories came out in the 
newspapers later, claiming that they were asked to declare their 
so-called political stand. I feel this is a pure 
misunderstanding. We did not mean it at all. 
  If you.... [Lu pauses] I believe by 1997, the overwhelming 
majority, 90 percent, of the civil servants will be happy to 
carry on in the Special Administrative Region Government. Only 
a small proportion of them may, when the time comes, wish to 
leave the government. We hope these people will notify us two 
or three months in advance, as required by regulations. 
  As to the issue of the land fund, I feel this is also a pure 
misunderstanding. At the subgroup discussion of the PWC, we 
made it very clear that the reason we discussed the issue of the 
land fund is that we hope on 1 July 1997, without a day's delay, 
we can hand the land fund of over 100 billion [no currency 
specified as heard], or something like that, to the SAR 
Government in one lump sum without retaining a cent. But the 
question is which organization the land fund should go to. We 
discussed whether it should be the Foreign Exchange Fund or the 
Hong Kong Government's Financial Department. No matter what, 
the land fund will certainly be handed to the Special 
Administrative Region Government. If the Special Administrative 
Region Government, for a time, cannot decide how to take care of 
this fund, it may temporarily retain the structure of the 
existing commission for managing the land fund. This is why I 
said it was a pure misunderstanding. [end recording] 
  [Yuan] The Sino-British row has continued to this day 
without showing any signs of improvement. When will Lu Ping 
come again? Has Chris Patten considered the possibility of the 
British side extending a formal invitation to Lu Ping? 
  [Begin recording] [Patten] Well, that is something we will 
have to look at, whether or not it is sensible to make another 
formal suggestion to Director Lu. I think he knows perfectly 
well that as far as we are concerned, whenever he would like a 
meeting, we would be very happy to have one. 
  [Lu] Now we do not have the basis. First, you must go 
through these channels, including the channel of the PWC, and 
the two sides start communication and create some prospect of a 
solution through negotiation. Then the two of us can have a 
talk on the basis of this and this is the only way we can 
possibly work out some solution. If we go ahead and meet each 
other while nothing has settled into shape, it will be all 
empty. The two of us cannot possibly discuss many detailed 
issues. Only when the detailed issues have been solved at the 
more preliminary levels can we expect some solution from our 
meeting. 
  [Patten] I very much hope that Director Lu will have had a 
very good week in Hong Kong, will have seen what progress we 
have made in the last couple of years since he has been able to 
be here, will have seen that despite what was said at the recent 
PWC meeting, there is not much sign of social turmoil here in 
Hong Kong. I hope he will have had an enjoyable stay and I hope 
it will have encouraged him to come back many times before 30 
June 1997. We would very much like to see him and I hope that 
each time he comes, he will be able to broaden the number of 
people that he actually sees and communicates with.

  [Text] Beijing, May 9 (CNS) -- State Councillor and 
Minister of National Defence, General Chi Haotian, speaking at a 
meeting with a delegation of Thailand's Senate Military 
Committee today, said that China was adopting a defensive policy 
on national defence and would not seek hegemony when it gets 
stronger. China, he said, hoped to develop its relations with 
bordering countries. 
  The Chinese minister stressed that the Chinese army was 
willing to promote its relations with its counterparts in 
foreign countries. The so-called "threat" of China was totally 
groundless. 
  General Chi spoke highly the friendly relations between the 
two countries and their armies. [sentence as received] 
  The Thai guests told to General Chi that after watching a 
military performance by the Chinese army, they were deeply 
impressed by the Chinese army's fighting strength and spirit of 
serving the people, adding that the might of China and the 
Chinese army was an important factor for maintaining peace and 
stability in the region.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Sutherland Calls for Fast Re-entry into </F>
GATT"] 
  [Text] Top GATT official Peter Sutherland yesterday called 
for China's early re-entry into the world trade body. 
  He made the remarks at a meeting in Beijing with Wu Yi, the 
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. 
  He said speeding up the admission of China and other 
applicants to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
remains one of his top priorities after the conclusion of the 
drawn-out Uruguay Round in Morocco last month. 
  And he urged both China and the trade body's members to work 
closely together to solve the remaining obstacles. 
  "There's a general willingness among GATT members to work 
constructively to bring the negotiations (over China's re-entry) 
to a conclusion," he said. 
  He expressed the hope that a draft protocol of China's 
re-entry would be hammered out by the end of June to pave the 
way for later negotiations. 
  He also called for a balanced treatment of China's entry, 
saying that it is not realistic to ask China to meet all demands 
before being re-admitted. 
  China should make "a big effort" to achieve re-entry as soon 
as possible, he said, adding that the key is to further open up 
the country's trade regime. 
  He said that he encouraged transparency and China's maximum 
participation in the current negotiations. "This will get a 
positive response from GATT members," he added. 
  Wu Yi said China will be able to make its trade regime more 
transparent. 
  "China not only has the political will, but also has the 
ability to further its economic reforms," she said. 
  She stressed that the latest reforms in the country's 
finance, foreign trade, investment, taxation and foreign 
exchange control systems will create a basic framework for 
China's market economy.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (AFP)--U.S. withdrawal of China's 
most-favoured-nation (MFN) status could seriously upset China's 
aim to rejoin the GATT by year's end, the world trade body's 
chief said here Wednesday. While the two issues are not 
directly related, MFN is an important principle within the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), GATT secretary 
general Peter Sutherland said. 
  "Therefore the U.S. attitude, as a major contracting party 
to 
the Chinese integration into the world economy, will be of 
considerable importance with regard to the conclusion of the 
negotiation for China's full accession into the World Trade 
Organisation (WTO)," Sutherland said. The WTO will replace GATT 
on January 1. 
  If MFN is withdrawn, "it may signal difficulties vis-a-vis 
the conclusion of China's re-entry to the WTO," Sutherland said. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton must decide by June 3 on whether 
to renew MFN, which he has made conditional on improvements in 
China's human rights record. "The US attitude is of central 
importance and that attitude will be signalled one way or 
another by events in the MFN issue," he added. 
  China, which was a founding member of GATT but left after 
the 
communists came to power in 1949, has made it clear that it 
attaches great political significance to being readmitted before 
the WTO's inception. Sutherland, who met Tuesday with Foreign 
Trade Minister Wu Yi, was speaking after giving a speech at an 
international seminar on the Chinese economy in which he warned 
that membership of the WTO was not "simply joining the club." 
  "It means entering into contractual undertakings based on 
mutual benefit," he said. "There is a responsibility on the 
part of China to show flexibility and to give adequate 
assurances" to GATT members that it can honour the obligations 
required by membership, he added. 
  While Chinese re-entry by year's end is possible, Sutherland 
told reporters that it would be a "difficult task." 
  "It depends ultimately on the willingness of all the parties 
to become extremely active in the negotiations and on the 
Chinese side to be immediately responsive to the concerns about 
transparency and other issues."

<F P=106> [Report: "Chinese Leader Says U.S. Revoking MFN Trading </F>
Status Means Giving Up China's Vast Market"] 
  [Text] A Chinese leader recently pointed out that China 
will definitely not accept the U.S. and Western views on human 
rights. As far as the most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status 
issue is concerned, brandishing the human-rights "big stick" 
will not lead to any good ending. 
  The Chinese leader said: China's views on human rights are 
different from those of the United States. There are many 
differences despite some similarities. The United States holds 
that the U.S. view on human rights is universally accepted but, 
in fact, only 1 billion people in this world endorse the U.S. 
view on human rights while the remaining 4 billion people do 
not. As far as the Chinese know, the U.S. human rights record 
is not good. In the United States, there is racial 
discrimination as well as discrimination and harassment against 
women; the crime rate is much higher in the United States than 
in China; and the United States did use firearms to quell the 
Los Angeles riots but China made no comment on this because it 
was an internal affair of the United States. 
  China places more stress on man's right to subsistence and 
development but this seems difficult for the United States to 
understand. As a Chinese saying goes: "The well fed do not know 
how the starving suffer." The U.S. per capita GNP is about 
$25,000, whereas China's GNP, even if quoted from U.S. 
statistics, is no more than $1,000. China is still a developing 
country with more than 80 million people still living in extreme 
poverty. Therefore, for China, the very first problem that must 
be dealt with is that of providing its 1.2 billion population 
with food, clothing, housing, and transport facilities, that is, 
the issues concerning the right to subsistence and development. 
The United States has already basically solved this problem. 
Therefore, what is being talked about in the United States 
nowadays is another right, specifically, the issue regarding the 
so-called principle of "one person, one vote" or the freedom to 
criticize the government. 
  This leader stressed that China will definitely not accept 
the U.S. and Western views on human rights. We would like to 
discuss the human rights issue with the United States and other 
Western countries on an equal footing but we will never tolerate 
pressure on us, the Chinese leader said. 
  Referring to the MFN issue, the Chinese leader said: The 
Americans have a well-known doctrine called the "carrot and 
stick" policy. The United States is currently holding a 
"carrot," that is, the MFN status and, on the other hand, a "big 
stick," that is, human rights. The MFN status is the foundation 
for normal economic and trade relations between the two 
countries and is not only favorable to China but also to the 
United States. The United States perhaps has an unrealistic 
belief that China very much fears that the U.S. side will revoke 
MFN status. Frankly speaking, China does not want to see the 
United States revoking China's MFN status. However, this does 
not mean that revoking MFN status will cause the sky to fall 
down and the earth to revolve in the opposite direction and, 
thus, the PRC will not be able to survive anymore and the 
Chinese economy will stop developing. To be sure, there will be 
some impact, but China is not so terribly afraid of the MFN 
status being revoked as the United States imagines. I have good 
grounds for saying that: First, China does not rely only on 
foreign trade, and China has its major market at home; and 
second, China has benefited from its trade with the United 
States but it has not benefited as much as the United States 
imagines. It is all right to compare Sino-U.S. trade to a 
"carrot" but this "carrot" is not so big as described by the 
United States. If the United States revoked China's MFN status 
the biggest victim would not be the Chinese people nor the 
Chinese economy. Of course, this does not mean that the Chinese 
economy will be unaffected at all but, the direct impact upon 
China will be much less than that on Hong Kong, Taiwan, and U.S. 
investors in China. Furthermore, the United States itself will 
also suffer very great losses. 
  This Chinese leader said: If the United States revokes 
China's MFN status, China will react in similar fashion. China 
is not only a big importer of U.S. wheat, chemical fertilizer, 
and timber, but also the biggest foreign buyer of Boeing 
airplanes. Just recently, the American Telephone and Telegraph 
Company entered the China market. China's present annual import 
volume is $100 billion. If China's import volume keeps growing 
by 9 percent a year, by 2000 its total annual import volume will 
reach $1,000 billion, which will present a huge market even 
measured on a world scale. So, if the United States revokes 
China's MFN status, this will imply that the United States will 
give up this market.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 KYODO -- The director general of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said Wednesday 
[11 May] China's reentry into the multilateral trading body by 
January 1995 will be a difficult task requiring firm commitments 
from China and GATT contracting parties. 
  GATT head Peter Sutherland, attending an economic summit in 
Beijing, said China's reentry would be dependent on China and 
trade body members hammering out a protocol by the end of June 
which can speed negotiations. 
  "The protocol is in effect a text of the agreement under 
which the reentry will take place. It will set up the broad 
terms and conditions under which China will reenter the 
multilateral system," he said. 
  China wants to reenter GATT before January 1995, when the 
Uruguay Round of agreements come into effect and GATT becomes 
the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
  Issues regarding transparency in China's trade regime and 
safeguards assuring that China will abide by GATT agreements are 
needed before reentry can take place, Sutherland said. 
  "One needs to be satisfied that the legislative framework is 
in place to provide an adequate assurance to the contracting 
parties that they have security in terms of trading policy," he 
said. 
  "Assurances need to be given that the (GATT trade) regime 
will be evenhandedly applied, not merely through national 
government but also at the provincial level. This is an 
obligation imposed on the Chinese Government authorities," he 
added. 
  Sutherland acknowledged the critical role of the United 
States in overseeing China's reentry, saying the U.S. is 
"constructively engaged" with the Chinese and there is no reason 
to believe that the U.S. is "blocking" China's reentry. 
  He said failure for the U.S. to renew China's 
most-favored-nation trading status in June would "signal 
difficulties vis-a-vis the conclusion of the reentry to the 
WTO," while maintaining that the issues "are not related." 
  Since Sutherland's arrival in China on Monday evening, the 
Chinese press has viewed his visit as an assurance that China 
will be allowed to enter the WTO at "an early date," preferably 
as a founding member. 
  China was a founding member of GATT but pulled out of the 
trading body after the People's Republic was founded in 1949. 
  The ongoing economic summit meeting has attracted many of 
China's top economic and trade leaders. Featured speakers 
include Sutherland, World Bank managing director Ernest Stern, 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and top executives 
from leading multinational enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- China hopes that the 
coming century will see neither world war nor cold war, that 
relations among nations will be more open and democratic and 
that the international community will advance in harmony. 
  This was stated by Qian Qichen, Chinese vice-premier and 
foreign minister, while addressing the opening of the symposium 
on the post- Cold War security situation in the Asia-Pacific 
region and its prospects here today. 
  Dozens of scholars and strategic studies experts from the 
United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the 
Republic of Korea, Russia, India, Singapore, the Philippines, 
Indonesia and Vietnam are participating in the three-day 
symposium. They are expected to focus on the security situation 
in the region, the security policies of the United States, 
Japan, China and Russia in the region, and approaches and 
measures to strengthen regional political and security 
co-operation. 
  The overall international situation has moved toward greater 
relaxation since the Cold War came to an end. However, there 
are still severe turmoil and unceasing military conflicts in 
most of the world, Qian said at the symposium. 
  In contrast, the political situation in the Asia-Pacific 
area 
is rather stable, as the progress there towards multipolarity 
started rather early and the Cold War impact was drastically 
reduced. Most countries in the region have long since given 
priority to domestic economic development, which has helped 
bring about a "virtuous circle of mutual promotion" between 
political stability and economic development, the foreign 
minister noted. 
  The situation of relative political stability in the region 
is the result of the close co-operation and concerted efforts of 
the relevant countries, who should all treasure and continue to 
consolidate and develop it, Qian said. 
  On the other hand, one should also note that there are 
indeed 
some factors of instability in the Asia-Pacific region in the 
post- Cold War period. Some of them are left-overs from the 
Cold War such as the Korean question; others are issues that 
have come to the fore over the end of the Cold War, such as 
economic friction and conflicts over territorial land and 
waters; still others have been caused by failure to adapt 
national considerations to the post-Cold War situation, as 
manifested in highlighting ideology and imposing one's will on 
others in handling relations between states. 
  Qian called on all countries in the region to base their 
relations with other countries entirely on the purposes and 
principles of the United Nations charter, the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence and other universally recognized norms 
governing international relations. Mutual respect and 
co-operation on an equal footing between states should replace 
hegemonism and power politics. Peaceful negotiation, dialogue 
and consultation should replace the threat or use of force. 
Equality, mutual benefit and complementarity should replace 
protectionism and economic sanctions in trade. "Only in this 
way can the existing and potential unstable factors be brought 
under effective control and be removed altogether, so as to help 
maintain and develop the present situation of peace and 
stability in the Asia-Pacific region," Qian stated. 
  He said that China is also in favor of a variety of channels 
and levels of bilateral or multilateral dialogue on Asia-Pacific 
security. Therefore, in addressing the security issues of the 
region, it is necessary to proceed from the realities and 
particular needs of the Asia-Pacific region and its sub-regions, 
and to improve communications and enhance mutual confidence 
among various parties. China appreciates the efforts of ASEAN to 
promote multilateral security dialogues in the region and will 
take an active part in the ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum), Qian said.

  Achieving the fourth general capital increase was an 
important achievement made at the meeting. At the close of the 
meeting, new ADB President Teruo Sato announced that the meeting 
already had enough votes to guarantee the doubling of the ADB's 
current $24- billion capital to $48 billion. This was the 
result of the Asia- Pacific region's relative political 
stability and economic vibrancy, and of the confidence of 
international capital in the region. The decision conforms to 
the aspirations of the vast numbers of developing countries in 
the Asia-Pacific region and is also in the interests of the 
creditor countries. Therefore it is generally welcomed. 
  Nonetheless, when discussing the question of the general 
capital increase during the meeting, some creditor countries 
linked the question of capital increase with some policy 
conditions, thus adding political conditions to the capital 
increase. The U.S. representative once remarked that "good 
management" was a key part of the ADB's credit terms. Asked 
what "good management" meant, he spoke only evasively, but did 
not give a direct reply. 
  The vast numbers of developing Asian countries showed 
concern 
and objected to this U.S. advocacy, pointing out justly that 
when increasing capital on the past three occasions, the ADB has 
never linked a capital increase with political considerations, 
and that the ADB therefore should continue to observe these 
rules. The Chinese representative solemnly pointed out: China 
supports the ADB's capital increase, but disagrees with linking 
policy questions with the capital increase. Moreover, it 
proposes that the ADB should place economic growth in the first 
place when formulating its credit policy. The practice of some 
who stubbornly link impertinent matters together will not work 
under the common struggle of developing Asian countries. 
However, this once again reminds us that attempts to intervene 
in the internal affairs of other countries using economic and 
other issues are worth guarding against. 
  It goes without saying that only the developing countries 
themselves best understand their national conditions and the 
importance and urgency of loan items. Over the years, the ADB 
has made unremitting efforts to improve and upgrade the quality 
of loan items, and the majority of creditor countries have put 
forward many rational proposals on loans and have helped improve 
the quality of loan items. This is welcomed by vast numbers of 
developing countries. In the ADB's future cooperation, creditor 
countries should continue to respect debtor countries, rather 
than do anything contrary to this. If so, the developed and 
developing countries can cooperate much better in the ADB, which 
is an important organization. Such cooperation is in the basic 
interests of all parties.

<F P=106> [Report: "MOFTEC Official Says United States Obstructs </F>
China's Entry to GATT"] 
  [Text] Yi Xiaozhun, director of the Department of 
International Economic and Trade Relations under the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC], said that China 
proposed at the working session on China's entry to the GATT 
that the establishment of the World Trade Organization [WTO] (on 
1 January 1995) should be set as a date for talks on China's 
entry to GATT. However, this proposal was rejected by the 
United States using the excuse that the time was not ripe. Yi 
said that this move by the United States blocked China's entry 
to the GATT. 
  In an interview with HSIN PAO, Yi Xiaozhun said that during 
the past two round of talks, that is, the fifth and sixth 
working sessions on China's entry to GATT, other GATT members, 
including the EU countries, backed China's efforts to accelerate 
the pace of the talks. At these sessions, the Chinese 
representative proposed that the establishment of the WTO should 
be set as the date for talks on China's entry to GATT to avoid 
the talks from dragging on. However, the U.S. representative 
said that this proposal was unacceptable. 
  The WTO is scheduled to be established on 1 January 1995 or 
earlier. If the original timetable is followed, China has only 
six months to strive for GATT entry. According to Yi Xiaozhun, 
because of domestic legislation, some of the founders of the WTO 
say that it is unlikely that they can complete the relevant 
legislation before 1 January 1995. Hence, they may ask for a 
postponement of the organization's establishment. Most members 
have suggested that the date of inauguration should be postponed 
to 1 July. If that is the case, China will have sufficient time 
for the talks. 
  As GATT is to be replaced by the WTO and abolished after the 
founding of the new organization, what happens if China cannot 
complete negotiations on entering GATT when the WTO is founded? 
Would this mean that China had to start preparations and talks 
on entering the WTO all over again? From a legal point of view, 
Yi Xiaozhun replied that GATT was somewhat different from the 
WTO. China has recently participated in negotiations on trade in 
services rather than the trading of ordinary goods. Talks on 
trade in services are within the scope of the WTO. In other 
words, obligations undertaken by China in the talks are not 
limited to GATT obligations. They cover a lot of ground and are 
accepted by WTO members. 
  Yi Xiaozhun said that the United States probably has 
political considerations in not being positive enough about 
China's entry to the GATT. When asked whether the United States 
had linked China's entry to the GATT with the extension of 
China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, Yi replied 
that the United States had explained in the past that the two 
would be handled separately. 
  Yi also cited examples of the passive attitude taken by the 
United States. He said that a protocol on China's GATT entry is 
now under deliberation. The protocol is a legal document 
defining the rights and obligations of GATT members, which is 
important and indispensable for GATT entry. The EU has already 
submitted a draft protocol on China's entry to the GATT. 
Instead of offering suggestions on the draft, the United States 
insisted that the timing was not right and was against 
discussing the protocol at the present stage. As a result, it 
was impossible to hold multilateral discussions on the protocol. 
  Yi Xiaozhun said that China would not accept the conditional 
U.S. extension of its MFN status and that China would retaliate 
even against partial sanctions imposed by the United States. 
  Earlier, a Canadian official said that if the United States 
withdrew China's MFN trading status, Canada, as a North American 
market, would open its door wider to China. If changes are 
effected in Sino-U.S. trade because of problems with MFN trading 
status, Yi said, it would be possible to make up for losses by 
finding a third party to serve as a substitute and pay no price. 
He believed that Canada could replace the United States in 
trade with China to a certain extent. He went on to say that 
Canada and Europe could replace the United States for wheat and 
exports of certain equipment and technology.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (AFP)--Chinese Foreign Trade 
Minister Wu Yi launched a thinly veiled attack Wednesday on the 
United States for politicising trade issues in a keynote speech 
mapping out China's trade strategy for the 1990s. 
  Describing the next seven years as a "crucial period", Wu 
outlined plans to shift the focus of China's export production, 
narrow regional economic disparities in the country and complete 
the construction of a legal framework governing foreign trade by 
1997. 
  She made the speech at an international symposium organised 
by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations. 
  While China is committed to the "extremely heavy and arduous 
task" of economic development, Wu said progress was being 
threatened by countries exerting economic pressures for 
political ends. 
  "Some countries politicise economic issues and follow 
unilateralism," Wu said in a clear reference to China's 
long-running MFN-human rights debate with the United States. 
"They often exert pressures on their trading partners with 
unilateral measures, which pose a direct threat to the operation 
of the multilateral trade system and is also detrimental to 
China's foreign economic and trade development," she said. 
  Despite strenuous objections fom Beijing, Washington has 
made 
the renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status 
in June conditional on progress in human rights. 
  Wu also made it clear that trade disputes with Beijing could 
penalise other countries, predicting that total imports to China 
in the next seven years "may well reach one trillion dollars." 
  In a further statement clearly directed at Washington, Wu 
thanked "most" members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) for supporting China's bid to re-enter the world 
trade body. However, she added that China "hopes that a certain 
contracting party will really fulfill its commitment and support 
China's return to GATT with real actions." 
  While the United States has voiced its backing for China's 
readmission, Beijing has accused Washington of setting overly 
demanding requirements and allowing the MFN issue to hamper the 
negotiating process. "I hope our trade partners will adopt an 
objective and fair attitude towards Chinese exports, earnestly 
abide by international trade rules and practices and eliminate 
discriminatory treatment against China," Wu added. China has 
made enormous efforts to facilitate re-entry to GATT, Wu said, 
highlighting "remarkable market access improvement and 
considerable rise of transparency in foreign trade regime." 
  Wu met here Tuesday with GATT secretary general Peter 
Sutherland, who made it clear that China must provide more 
concrete assurances on the issues of transparency and market 
access if it is to rejoin GATT by year's end. 
  She said priority would be given over the next seven years 
to 
realising the transition from light industrial products and 
textiles as the main exports to machinery, and electronic, heavy 
industrial and chemical products. 
  "We also intend to establish a relatively complete system of 
foreign economic and trade legislation within a period of three 
years or so," she said. 
  At the same time, "more attention and support" will be given 
to inland areas through the adoption of preferential policies 
that will allow them to close the gap on the economically 
developed coastal regions.

  [Text] Washington, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Some leading U.S. 
congressmen today called for de-linking human rights and trade 
in order to get the country's China policy right. 
  Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, told an American Enterprise Institute conference on 
China here that the United States needs a multi-faceted policy 
toward China. 
  "With a country as important and complex as China, we cannot 
allow one interest -- whether it is human rights, commercial 
ties, or geopolitical strategy -- to dominate," he said. 
  He urged president Clinton "to present to the Congress and 
the country a China policy that looks towards the future, not 
the past." 
  Speaking of what the U.S. policy should be on MFN, he noted 
that whatever leverage MFN conditionality has provided in the 
past year, its application in this next phase would probably be 
counterproductive. "It is time to de-link," he stressed. 
  He also disagreed with the argument in favor of imposing 
selective sanctions. It "is not workable...it would be just as 
confusing as the present state of affairs," he said. 
  Also speaking at the conference, Senator Max Baucus warned 
that China is not a country "we can take lightly." 
  The policy of MFN conditions, he pointed out, has proven 
ineffective in promoting human rights, and revoking MFN is, in 
fact, the economic equivalent of "dropping a nuclear bomb." 
  "If we continue a conditional, year-by-year renewal policy, 
sooner or later, the nuclear bomb will go," he added. 
  Baucus described the United States as being isolated in 
linking human rights and trade with China. "Not one country 
supports our policy...carrying it out would be a disaster," he 
remarked. 
  "The time has come to do what we ought to do -- to renew MFN 
permanently and take it out of politics for good," he said. 
  Most of the other speakers at the one-day conference were 
also united in calling for unconditional renewal of MFN as the 
best way to maintain normal economic and trade relations with 
China.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Some Beijing-based U.S. 
entrepreneurs called recently for their government to extend 
China's most favored nation (MFN) status this year out of 
consideration for U.S. business interests in the large market of 
China. 
  The entrepreneurs include the first representatives of the 
Beijing offices of General Motors (GM), Ford, McDonnell Douglas 
(MDC), Motorola, United Technology Company (UTC), Du Pont, 
American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T), Chase Manhattan 
Bank, 
Amoco and Caltex oil company. 
  During recent interviews with XINHUA, they shared the view 
that China's economy, developing at a high rate and providing 
favorable opportunities for U.S. enterprises in the country, and 
the bilateral trade ties played a significant role in the 
recovery of the U.S. economy. 
  The United States would pay a high price if the U.S.-China 
trade relations were damaged as a result of suspension of MFN 
status, they said. 
  Diane Terry, secretary general of the American-China Chamber 
of Commerce representing 400 U.S. companies in China, pointed 
out that the countries' two-way trade has expanded rapidly since 
the two countries established diplomatic relations 15 years ago, 
and China has become the 8th largest trade partner of the United 
States. 
  And more than 500 multi-national companies in the U.S. have 
marked China as one of their future investment priorities, she 
said, adding that total U.S. contracted volume of investment 
reached 11 billion U.S. dollars in China's over 10,000 projects 
by the end of last year, which led all foreign investment in 
China. 
  Only if the bilateral trade ties were normal could the U.S. 
companies make expected achievements, she said. 
  Richard Latham, president of the United Technologies China 
operation, expressed his hope that President Clinton would 
extend China's MFN status in the interest of U.S. companies in 
China. 
  Peter Chapman, president of McDonnell Douglas China company, 
said that if the U.S.-China relations can develop smoothly, U.S. 
enterprises will benefit a lot since China will import goods 
valued at 700 billion U.S. dollars within the next seven years. 
  He took his company as an example by saying that since MDC 
entered China in 1975, it had sold China a batch of planes, and 
40 planes have been assembled by the MDC-China joint venture in 
Shanghai. 
  If an agreement could be reached, the company would 
manufacture scores of additional planes for China's main air 
routes, Chapman said. 
  Rudi von Meister and James Paulsen, heads of GM and Ford in 
China, shared the view that if a trade conflict was triggered by 
the MFN issue, other Western companies, taking the opportunity, 
would occupy the lion's share of the Chinese market, thus 
becoming strong competitors of U.S. enterprises. 
  Chai Sun Lai, president of Motorola China company, said that 
when President Clinton makes his decision in June, he must take 
into account the interests of the American people. 
  According to some experts, the inflation rate in the U.S. 
would be 0.15 percent more annually if it lost China, a main 
supplier of consumer goods, and each U.S. consumer would pay 140 
dollars more for substitutions for Chinese products. Besides, 
160,000 people would lose their jobs. 
  Besides, all these enterprisers pointed out, the policy of 
linking trade and human rights is popular neither in the world 
nor in the United States. 
  "In the past, companies postponed canvassing in Washington 
until May," Latham said. "But they began their action at the 
beginning of the year this time. UTC has made a plan from 
January to June." 
  All the businessmen said that a good trend has appeared 
recently in Washington, and they hoped that Clinton would not 
make the "mistake of the times" as THE NEW YORK TIMES called it 
-- eliminating China's MFN status.

  [Text] Beijing, May 1 (XINHUA) -- Ford, a leading U.S. 
motor company, has gradually carried out its development plan in 
China by seeking opportunities to set up joint ventures 
producing auto components, a top manager of the company said. 
  "We are satisfied with our achievement in China over past 
decade, and we still have lots to do here," said James Paulsen, 
president of the Ford China operation, in a recent interview 
with XINHUA. 
  In the past year, Ford exported to China 6200 vehicles, 
double the 1992 figure, and sales service is now available in 
China's 10 major cities. 
  Besides, Ford and China's Natural Science Foundation have 
signed an agreement last October to establish a fund to finance 
China's research in advanced auto components and technology, and 
on April 28 this year, 19 Chinese universities and institutes 
were awarded 25 scientific research grants. 
  The company's next step is to set up a joint venture with 
China to manufacture auto components to meet the demands of all 
kinds of China-made vehicles, Paulsen said. 
  "Ford's long-term objective in China is to assemble vehicles 
after helping China to develop its auto components manufacturing 
base," said the newly-appointed president. 
  To achieve the aim, the company established Ford China 
operation last March to coordinate its business with China, 
including components manufacturing, technology licensing and 
joint scientific and technology research. 
  Meanwhile, Ford and China's five biggest auto producers 
co-established a research and development center for auto 
components last year. It marks the first time Ford has made 
such cooperation with foreign companies.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (YONHAP) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin will pay an official visit to South Korea in the second 
quarter of this year, according to a Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
  In a meeting with South Korean correspondents here, 
Spokesman 
Chen Guosang said Monday that "the Chinese leader will 
definitely visit South Korea." 
  "A foreign visit by the top Chinese leader is customarily 
decided upon in relatively short time before the actual visit 
takes place," Chen said. "President Jiang's visit to South Korea 
is just a matter of time." 
  The spokesman thus did not rule out the possibility that 
Jiang's Seoul visit could be realized earlier than generally 
expected. 
  President Kim Yong-sam extended an invitation to Jiang to 
visit South Korea during their march summit meeting in Beijing, 
which the Chinese president accepted.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata today contacted Chinese and South Korean leaders to 
apologize for former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remarks 
shrugging off Japan's wartime atrocities before and during World 
War II. 
  Hata said in a written message to Chinese Premier Li Peng 
and 
a telephone call to S. Korean President Kim Yong-sam that 
Nagano's statement caused pain and anger to the peoples of 
Japan's Asian neighboring countries, Japanese Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  The government instructed Japanese embassies in member 
states 
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which 
includes Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore 
and Thailand, to explain that Tokyo's policy is to build 
future-oriented ties, while squarely facing history, said the 
officials. 
  In his messages, Hata referred to his policy speech 
delivered 
in the Diet (parliament) earlier in the day in which he renewed 
the government recognition that Japan's past actions, including 
aggression and colonial rule, inflicted unbearable suffering and 
sorrow on many people. 
  "Communicating this to future generations, the path which 
Japan must take, based on its deep remorse, is to do its utmost 
toward the creation of peace and toward the construction of a 
bright future for the Asia-Pacific region," he said. 
  Nagano, 71, resigned Saturday [7 May] to take responsibility 
for his remarks that the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication 
and that Japan was not a nation of aggression during World War 
II.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 KYODO -- Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir Mohamad slammed Western-style democracy Wednesday [11 
May] while praising China's brand of authoritarianism. 
  Speaking at an international conference on China's economic 
reforms, Mahathir blamed the West for being "motivated by 
selfish interests" when professing concerns over humanitarian, 
democratic and environmental issues in Asia. 
  Although invited to comment on China's socialist market 
economy, Mahathir embarked on a long tirade on the difficulties 
Malaysia had in developing its own brand of democracy. 
  "The worst part is the assumption that democratic Western 
countries can foist their principles through undemocratic 
means," he said. "Sanctions, arm twisting of various kinds and 
sustained campaigns through their controlled media are weapons 
they never hesitate to use." 
  While calling democracy the "greatest idea ever conceived by 
man," he also said Asian societies, in contrast to the West, 
believed in strong stable governments, instead of weak 
governments which are constantly changing. 
  Greater democracy and individual freedom to go against the 
interests of the majority are luxuries China can ill afford now, 
he said, while adding authoritarianism is better than anarchy. 
  "An anarchic situation is not going to facilitate the growth 
and flowering of a free market," he said. "Business needs 
order." 
  "Already we see the Chinese being badgered and hectored to 
conform to systems and values which have been devised elsewhere 
for the benefit of different people," he said in an obvious 
reference to U.S. pressure on China to improve its human rights 
record. 
  The Malaysian leader discounted China's growing military 
expenditures, saying if China is a threat to East Asia, then 
Japan's military growth is equally threatening. 
  "On the other hand a prosperous China will become the engine 
of growth firstly for East Asia, including Southeast Asia and 
the world," he said. 
  Mahathir, who did not rule out future upheaval and bloodshed 
in China, concluded that the "socialist market economy" is the 
answer to China's political and economic needs and China should 
not attempt to make a radical political change. 
  "The day will come when individual freedom to disrupt and 
undermine the well-being of the great majority will be enshrined 
in the democratic values of China," he predicted. "But for the 
moment the interest of the majority demands an orderly society."

cooperation between China and the countries in the world."

<F P=106> [By reporters Xu Furui (6079 4395 3843) and Wu Ping (0702 </F>
1627)] 
  [Text] Stockholm, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CPPCC] National Committee who is visiting Sweden, met with 
Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt at the prime minister's 
residence this morning. The two leaders pledged to exert joint 
efforts to promote bilateral relations to a new level. 
  Li Ruihuan said: China and Sweden have been in contact for 
several hundred years. Under extreme difficult conditions, our 
forefathers overcame obstacles and dangers in opening up trade 
routes between our two countries. After the founding of New 
China, Sweden was the first Western nation to establish 
diplomatic relations with the PRC. In the past several decades, 
the relations between the two countries have been generally 
good. Through common efforts, the two countries have 
continually expanded exchanges and cooperation in the political, 
economic and trade, science and technology, and cultural fields. 
With a profound sense of responsibility toward history, the 
leaders of the two countries shall cherish still more our 
hard-earned friendship and continue to expand the bilateral 
relations based on the efforts of our forefathers and leaders of 
the older generation. 
  Li Ruihuan said: China and Sweden are far away from each 
other, and have no conflict of basic interests. On the 
contrary, there are broad prospects for economic cooperation 
because the economies of the two countries are mutually 
complementary. China is carrying out large scale economic 
development and there is much in Sweden's advanced technology 
and management experience that we can make use of. During my 
visit to your country, I have personally witnessed Swedish 
entrepreneurs' strong desire to strengthen cooperation with 
China. There is great potential for bilateral cooperation. Our 
two countries should exert joint efforts to push bilateral 
cooperation to a new stage, which corresponds with the common 
interests and aspirations of the two peoples. 
  Li Ruihuan said: Differences of views between countries are 
natural. Many problems can be resolved properly with the 
passage of time, and in the spirit of mutual respect, equality 
and mutual benefit; of seeking common grounds while reserving 
differences; and of common development. He added: We should 
work together to push bilateral relations to a new level bearing 
in mind the fundamental interests of the two peoples and 
long-range interests of the two countries. 
  Bildt spoke highly of China's great economic achievements 
since the implementation of the reform and open policy, saying 
that it is important not only for China but also for Eastern 
Asia and the world economy. The Swedish prime minister said 
that bilateral relations between China and Sweden have developed 
rapidly in recent years. He hoped that bilateral relations will 
further develop. He also expressed Swedish support for China's 
reentry into the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade.

  [Text] Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who is 
currently on a tour of Sweden, arrived by special airplane in 
Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, at midday 8 May local time. 
Greeting him at the airport were officials from the Swedish 
Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy staff in Sweden. [video 
shows Li, accompanied by Chinese and Swedish officials, walking 
down the ramp from the airplane, cutting to show him shaking 
hands with well-wishers and leaving the airport in a limousine] 
  In the afternoon, Chairman Li Ruihuan met with (B. 
Vromberg), 
a renowned Swedish entrepreneur in industrial, commercial, and 
financial circles. Chairman Li Ruihuan expressed his 
appreciation for Mr. (Vromberg's) foresight and judiciousness in 
developing economic relations with Chinese, as well as his 
long-term, unremitting efforts to develop Sino-Swedish friendly 
relations and cooperation. 
  Li Ruihuan said: China's economy is developing in a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy manner. Sweden possesses ample 
experience and certain advantages to help China develop, on a 
priority basis, a variety of sectors, such as transportation, 
communications, energy, and raw and semifinished materials. I 
am convinced that through joint efforts by the two sides, Sweden 
will be able to make even greater progress in developing 
cooperation with some Chinese provinces and municipalities, as 
well as cooperation between enterprises in the two countries. 
  In the evening, Chairman Li Ruihuan cordially met with local 
Chinese nationals and student representatives at the Chinese 
embassy. [video shows Li chatting with them in a well-lighted 
hall] 
  During his tour of Gothenburg, Chairman Li Ruihuan visited 
Volvo Automobile Company, one of the 60 largest companies in the 
world.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- China is going to launch 
another 30 foreign satellites of different types from 1994 to 
around the year 2000, a senior official announced here today. 
  Hui Yongzheng, vice-minister of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, also said that China is researching and 
fabricating a new generation of satellites, including the 
large-capacity No. 3 Dongfanghong communications satellite and 
the No. 1 multi-use earth resources satellite. 
  He revealed these plans at a news conference concerning the 
ministerial conference on space applications for development in 
the region of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and 
the Pacific, which is to open in September this year in Beijing. 
  The official said that a series of China's Long March 
carrier 
rockets has been formed, and the type has been put into general 
use and become standardized. It has also gone into mass 
production. 
  "China has recently successfully launched the Long March-3A 
carrier rocket, indicating the rocket not only can meet domestic 
demands, but can also provide a wide range of services for the 
international market," Hui said. 
  He revealed that China has been entering a new stage in 
launching commercial satellites for foreign customers, with a 
series of launching contracts being carried out. 
  He said that China will actively import foreign capital, 
technology and management experience in a bid to speed up the 
formation of the country's export-oriented space industry. The 
export of civilian space technology and products will be 
encouraged. 
  As to China's international cooperation in the space sector, 
he said that China attaches special importance to developing 
countries. 
  "China has signed governmental space pacts and key project 
contracts with Brazil, India, Pakistan, Argentina, Iran and the 
Republic of Korea," he said, adding that Sino-Brazilian 
cooperation on the research and production of a resources 
satellite is going smoothly. 
  China has also trained more than 40 space experts for Ghana, 
Mongolia, Laos, Malaysia, Tanzania, Pakistan and Vietnam, he 
said. 
  China each year invests about 400 million yuan in its 
civilian space projects, he added. Now China's space industry, 
with 100,000 staff involved, is available for research, design, 
experimentation and fabrication of various satellites, carrier 
rockets and other high-tech products. 
  He said that the Chinese mainland wants to promote exchanges 
and cooperation with Taiwan in the space sector. The mainland 
is holding a positive attitude towards cooperation in satellite 
technology, ground systems, launch services and satellite 
applications. 
  "However, up to now, there has been no substantial progress 
in space cooperation across the Taiwan Straits," he said. 
  About sending men into space, he said that departments 
concerned are organizing experts for discussion. But they have 
to wait for a yes or no from the government.

<F P=106> [By reporter Han Zhenjun (7281 2182 6511)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 14 Apr (XINHUA) -- After more than 30 
years, China has achieved world-renowned successes in applying 
nuclear technology in agriculture, and the successes are 
yielding economic returns worth 3.32 billion yuan per year. The 
results achieved in certain fields rank top in the world. 
Radioactive breeding, in particular, has been highly assessed 
by the International Nuclear Energency Agency. 
  According to statistics, the 383 mutated fine seed strains 
which China has bred with radioactive breeding technology 
account for nearly one-third of the world's total seed strains 
bred by means of mutation induction, placing China on top of the 
world in this regard. As a result of radioactive breeding, 
China has come in control of a large number of distintive 
mutants that can promote early maturity, short stem, disease and 
degeneration resistance [kang ni 2123 6627], and fine quality, 
creating a gene bank for seed breeding. Currently the annual 
acreage for these new seed strains has been maintained at more 
than 9 million hectares; and the use of fine seed strains has 
increased the output of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops by 
nearly 5 billion kg and brought in more than 3 billion yuan of 
economic returns each year. The total value received from the 
higher output is 800 times of the total investment in the 
research. Following the introduction of the three nationally 
well-known new strains -- the "Lumian No. 1" cotton, the 
"Yuanfengzao" rice, and the "Tiefeng 18" soybean -- which won 
state awards, first class, for invention, China has again 
successfully bred the new rice strain, the "Zhefu 802," which 
has now become the most widely planted rice species in China. 
  The application of radioactive breeding technology has now 
expanded from grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops to 
vegetables, fruits, mulberry, rubber, and flowers. By improving 
the "Xiangzaoru No. 1" glutinous rice, Hunan's scientists and 
technicians have tackled the species' problem of low yield; and 
now the rice species, which are of better quality and pest 
resistant, have become Hunan's dominant glutinous rice species 
and their use has expanded to 16 other provinces and regions, 
including Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Hubei. Because of their 
adaptability to north China's cold climate, the fast growing 
soybean and cold-resistant rubber species which China has 
successfully bred in recent years are growing in sizable parts 
in north China. The "Yuandong No. 3," a newly bred wheat 
strain, is resistant to rust disease, powdery mildew, aphid, dry 
and hot wind, and soil salinization. This extraordinary wheat 
strain that can ensure steady output is being introduced on 
sizable areas. 
  Making insect pests infertile is a special application of 
nuclear technology in agriculture. The idea is to kill insect 
pests through letting loose male insects that have been made 
infertile with radiation so that female insects that mate with 
them cannot reproduce. Remarkable progress has already been 
made in this research project. To control fruit flies [da shi 
ying 1129 1395 5859] that menace tangerines, scientists and 
technicians once let loose 100,000 male flies that had been made 
infertile through radiation on a 500-mu experimental tangerine 
farm in Guizhou. Consequently the menace of the flies in the 
farm dropped from 5-8 percent to 0.005 percent. This virtually 
complete extinction has served as a basis for widespread 
application of the technique that makes insect pests infertile. 
  The application of isotopic tracing technology in 
agriculture, which has substantially upgraded China's 
agricultural research, plays a significant part in guiding 
agricultural production. The results obtained from the research 
can be used for teaching farmers how to correctly and 
economically use fertilizers, and also can be used for studying 
how to prevent environmental pollution through understanding the 
residue of agricultural chemicals in plants and soil. 
  Meanwhile, China has also succeeded in increasing the 
hatching and sprouting rates of soybeans and eggs of silk 
cocoons, carps, prawns, and in accelerating their growth and 
maturity through treating them with low-dosage radiation. Prawn 
output has now increased 15-20 percent, and silk output has 
increased 20 percent.

Yuezhong (7806 1471 1813), chairman of the Anhui Provincial 
Planning Commission, to the Second Session of the Eighth Anhui 
Provincial People's Congress on the implementation of Anhui's 
1993 national economic and social development plan and the draft 
1994 plan] 
  [Text] Entrusted by the provincial people's government, I 
am delivering a report to the Second Session of the Eighth Anhui 
Provincial People's Congress on the implementation of Anhui's 
1993 national economic and social development plan and the draft 
1994 plan. 
<H5>  1. Implementation of the 1993 Plan </H5>
  Anhui's gross domestic product [GDP] for 1993 amounted to 94 
billion yuan, up 21.6 billion yuan or, when calculated in terms 
of comparable prices, increasing 22 percent from 1992. It was 9 
percent higher than the original target. 
  Efforts have been made for attaining comparatively 
well-off living standards and the rural economy has been 
invigorated in an all-around manner. The added value of 
agricultural output was 25.4 billion yuan, up 10 percent. (The 
total agricultural output value was 41.7 billion yuan, up 8.5 
percent.) Village and town enterprises continued to develop 
rapidly, reporting a sales value of 108.45 billion yuan, up 
102.2 percent over that of 1992. 
  Enterprise reform has continued to deepen and 
industrial output has increased rapidly. Enterprises 
including Maanshan Iron and Steel, Anhui Energy, and Meiling 
Corporation have succeeded in conducting reform and listing 
their stock to be bought and sold at stock markets. Various 
reforms in enterprises and corporations -- including state 
ownership under nongovernmental management, collective ownership 
under private operation, different ways to form enterprises and 
corporations, and experimental shareholding systems -- have been 
progressing in a healthy manner. The added value of Anhui's 
industrial output was 42.9 billion yuan, up 37 percent over that 
of 1992. (The total industrial output value was 140.2 billion 
yuan, up 44.6 percent.) Anhui's industries have considerably 
raised their economic returns. 
  Investment structure has been rationally readjusted. 
Key construction and technical transformation projects have 
increased. Public investments in fixed assets were 28.99 
billion yuan, up 35 percent over that of 1992. 
  Anhui has opened up wider to the outside world and the 
total amount of foreign capital actually used in the province 
has increased remarkably. Export-oriented economic sectors 
gradually became more active as 16 prefectures and cities and 
some enterprises have been authorized to export goods on their 
own. The establishment of 1,040 new "three types of wholly or 
partly foreign- owned" enterprises was approved in 1993, and the 
total amount of foreign capital actually used in the province 
was $260 million, up 420 percent over that of 1992. 
  Domestic markets have been prosperous and active. 
Anhui has accelerated its pace in price reform. 
  Anhui has considerably increased its revenues, and has 
made new contributions in financial work. Revenues in 1993 
totaled 7.32 billion yuan, up 32.8 percent. Anhui's financial 
expenses in 1993 were 7.22 billion yuan, down 2.6 percent. The 
financial account for 1993 was balanced. At the end of 1993, 
the amount of Anhui's public savings at banks was 49.44 billion 
yuan, up 10.08 billion yuan over that of 1992. The amount of 
various bank loans extended was 71.21 billion yuan, increasing 
12.67 billion yuan over that of 1992. 
  Anhui has accomplished new achievements in science, 
technology, and education, and has made further progress in 
various social undertakings. In 1993, Anhui organized and 
implemented 85 projects to tackle scientific and technological 
problems, and accomplished 645 scientific and technological 
achievements at or above the provincial and departmental level. 
In 1993, Anhui's institutions of higher learning admitted 
32,300 students to regular undergraduate and special courses, 
increasing 35.6 percent. Its secondary specialized schools 
enrolled 44,600 students, up 52.3 percent. 
  Urban and rural residents have considerably improved 
their living standards. The population growth rate was 
lower than the national average. According to a random survey, 
Anhui urban residents' per capita cash income for living 
expenses was 2,025.7 yuan and peasants' net per capita income 
was 724 yuan. In 1993, Anhui's natural population growth rate 
was 10.67 per thousand. 
  Some major acute contradictions and problems of 1993 follow: 
We have yet to completely smoothen some links in macroeconomic 
regulation and administration. Investments in agriculture have 
been inadequate and infrastructural facilities in the 
agricultural sector are relatively weak. New key industries 
have not developed fast enough. Economic benefits still mainly 
depend on an increased growth rate. Some enterprises are facing 
difficulties in production and operation. Increases in 
commodity prices have been too high. Anhui is short of funds. 
The development of social undertakings has been slow. 
  2. Guiding Thoughts and Major Objectives of Anhui's 
1994 National Economic and Social Development 
  Guiding thoughts of Anhui's 1994 economic work follow: 
Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's 
basic line, we should resolutely implement the party Central 
Committee's policy on "seizing opportunities, deepening reform, 
opening up wider to the outside world, enhancing development, 
and maintaining stability." While ensuring that both quality and 
benefits are higher than those of 1992, we should facilitate a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian 
kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] in the 
national economy in an effort to promote all-around social 
progress. 
  The principal goals follow: 
  -- The GDP should increase 13-15 percent over that of 1993. 
Out of the total, primary industries should increase 3.6-3.8 
percent (and the total agricultural output value should rise 
more than 4 percent); secondary industries should increase 
16.6-19 percent (and the total industrial output value should 
rise more than 25 percent); and tertiary industries should go up 
22-24 percent. 
  -- We should strive to further improve our tasks in 
reversing 
losses and increasing profits. Enterprises with a gross 
national product [GNP] of 10,000 yuan or above should reduce 
energy consumption by 2.25 percent. The marketability rate of 
industrial products should be more than 96 percent. Major 
indices of economic efficiency -- including the proportion of 
profits and taxes as a percentage of total capital, the 
frequency of circulation funds, and labor force productivity in 
Anhui -- should all be higher than those of 1993. 
  -- Village and town enterprises should have sales revenues 
of 
more than 150 billion yuan. 
  -- Public investments in fixed assets are expected to be 35 
billion yuan, increasing 21 percent over those of 1993. This 
will include state-owned units' investments of 9.32 billion 
yuan, as allocated by the state at the beginning of 1994. 
  -- Anhui's social commodities retail volume should be 47 
billion yuan, or attain a 20-percent increase. 
  -- Our total foreign trade value should be $1.59 billion, or 
up 23.5 percent, of which the export value should be $1.1 
billion. The actual use of foreign funds should amount to $480 
million, of which, $180 million should be in the form of medium 
and long-term foreign loans. 
  -- Anhui's financial revenues should reach 8.538 billion 
yuan, up 16.6 percent over those of 1992, or when calculated in 
terms of comparable prices, increasing 9.2 percent from 1992. 
  -- The rate of the increase in overall social retail 
commodities prices should be controlled to be lower than the 
national average. 
  -- Regarding 1993 wages as a base, we should considerably 
increase the average wages of staff and workers. Also, 
peasants' net per capita income should increase more than 100 
yuan from 1993. 
  -- Anhui's natural population growth rate should be 
controlled under 14.96 per thousand as instructed by the state. 
<H5>  3. Major Objectives of Anhui's 1994 National Economic and </H5>
Social Development 
<H5>  (1) We should regard raising peasants' income as the </H5>
central task and comprehensively develop the rural economy. 
  It is necessary to further restructure the agricultural 
production framework. We should stress high yields, high 
quality, and high efficiency in agriculture; should provide 
guidance to village and town enterprises according to various 
categories; and should continually accelerate in carrying out 
the "1235" [numerals as published] project. Furthermore, we 
should strive to promote the rural shareholding joint-venture 
system; raise funds, through various channels, to develop 
village and town enterprises; make efforts to increase 
agricultural investments; and enhance the construction of 
agricultural infrastructural projects. 
  We should strive to raise peasants' incomes by increasing 
productivity, and take effective measures to ensure that 
benefits such as higher state procurement prices for cotton and 
grain are received by peasants. Additionally, we should 
realistically reduce peasants' burdens and enable poor areas to 
expeditiously shake off poverty and become rich. 
  (2) Great efforts will be made to readjust industrial 
structure and build up our capacity for sustained economic 
development 
  In 1994, we will formulate the development plans for 
automobiles, engineering machinery, daily-use electric 
appliances, electronics, iron and steel, non-ferrous metal, and 
building materials industries, as well as intensive processing 
industry for agricultural and sideline products. We will 
support the development of high-priority key industries and 
products by increasing credit loans, using foreign capital, 
encouraging joint ventures, recommending the share-holding 
system, and experimenting on turning debtors into partners. 
Light, textile, and other conventional industries will 
particularly pay attention to market demand and to opening up 
the market. We will continue to strengthen basic industries. 
  (3) We will actively promote the reform of the 
investment system, make great efforts to readjust investment 
patterns, increase investment, and earnestly step up the 
construction of key projects. 
  We will increase investment in infrastructural construction, 
basic industries and backbone industries, such as agriculture, 
water resources, transport, telecommunications, energy sources, 
and important raw and processed materials. More efforts will be 
made for the technological transformation of enterprises. We 
will concentrate on the construction of key projects and 
actively do good preparatory work for the Eighth Five-Year-Plan 
projects. We will vigorously promote the reform of the 
investment system. 
  (4) We will step up the construction of the market 
system and strive to open up the market. 
  We will give higher priorities to planning the construction 
of 11 wholesale markets for capital goods and agricultural and 
sideline products, 11 shopping centers, and a number of 
provincial border markets. We plan to establish a provincial 
securities trading center, increase securities trading firms, 
and develop urban and rural cooperative banks. We will 
accelerate the development of the technology market. We will 
step up the establishment of labor service and real estate 
markets. Attention will be paid to the development of brokerage 
and service agencies in the market. 
  (5) We will open up wider to the outside, make efforts 
to use foreign capital, and increase exports. 
  We will make full and flexible use of the preferential 
policies granted by the state to the two open cities Hefei and 
Wuhu, accelerate the development of the export-oriented economy 
in the province, and strive to maintain the development momentum 
of the Wuhu economic and technological development zone and the 
Hefei high-technological industries development zone. We will 
vigorously develop international tourism. 
  Efforts will be made to expand export trade. We will 
actively increase sources of export goods, and strive to enable 
more of our production-related, scientific and technological, 
materials, and commercial enterprises to obtain the foreign 
trade authority. We will rationally arrange imports. 
  We will use foreign capital more boldly and more 
effectively, 
and strive to set up 3,000 or more new joint ventures, 
cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises 
and to obtain $1 billion of foreign investment this year. We 
will continue to make effective use of loans from foreign 
governments, monetary organizations, and commercial banks. 
  (6) We will strive to increase revenues, optimize the 
credit structure, and promote direct capital flow. 
  We will continue to pay attention to increasing the sources 
of revenues, match revenue increases with economic growth, and 
strive to receive 8.5 billion yuan of revenues in 1994. We will 
actively make banks play the role of main channels of capital 
flow, vigorously seek savings deposits, and further optimize the 
use of loans. A further step will be taken to widen the 
channels of direct capital flow. 
  (7) We will control excessive commodity price 
increases and strive to improve the people's living standards. 
  First, we will meticulously implement the pricing system 
reform plan according to the demands set by the state. Second, 
we will improve macroeconomic coordination, maintain an overall 
economic balance, make the "vegetable basket" project a success, 
and ensure market supply. Third, we will establish as soon as 
possible a reserve system for major agricultural products and 
keep improving it; and we will establish a grain risk fund. 
Fourth, we will pay more attention to monitoring and examining 
the prices of daily necessities and services for residents, and 
promptly adopt measures to control excessive price rises. 
  A further step will be taken to improve the living standards 
and increase the income of the people in both urban and rural 
areas. 
  (8) We will accelerate the transformation of scientific 
and technological achievements into practical productive forces, 
give high priority to the development of education, and 
coordinate the development of other social undertakings. 
  First, we will take advantage of planning and the market to 
accelerate the industrial application of a number of selected 
major scientific and technological achievements which can be 
widely applied, yield high added value and good economic 
efficiency, and play a great promoting role. Second, we will 
apply advanced science and technology in transforming 
conventional industries. Third, we will strive to achieve 
success in the projects of tackling tough scientific and 
technological problems assigned by the central and provincial 
authorities, and accelerate the transfer of military industry 
technologies to civilian sectors. Fourth, we will accelerate 
the establishment of a system for managing science and 
technology, as well as a science and technology operating 
mechanism, which conform to socialist market economic structure. 
Fifth, we will convene a provincial science and technology 
congress. 
  We will give high priority to the development of education. 
Efforts will be made to ensure success in basic education, 
accelerate the development of secondary vocation and technical 
education, and develop multi-form, multi-level adult education 
with on-the-job training and continued education as its main 
forms. We will steadily develop the higher education and strive 
to increase educational investment. We will take a further step 
to step up the building of socialist spiritual civilization and 
to actively promote cultural, sports, public health, press, 
publication, radio broadcasting, cinema, television, civil 
affairs and other social undertakings. We will increase 
investment in social undertakings through various channels and 
in various forms. We will continue to improve the family 
planning work. We will pay attention to nationwide improvement 
of farmland and environmental protection.

  [Text] Fuzhou, May 11 (XINHUA) -- This capital of 
southeast China's Fujian Province has made remarkable headway in 
improving its old urban districts with overseas investment. 
  A local official said that the city government had approved 
the establishment of 310 overseas-funded companies engaged in 
real estate business by the end of last year. 
  These companies had a combined investment of 2.5 billion 
U.S. 
dollars, including contractual overseas funds totalling 2.2 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  The city has already leased out 442.3 ha [hectare] of land 
and approved 134 overseas-funded real estate projects. 
  So far, construction of projects with a total floor space of 
3.5 million sq m and accounting for 60.7 percent of the city's 
target are proceeding well and some have been completed. 
  The official attributed the progress to the city 
government's 
policy of unified planning and transforming stretches of old 
districts; and leasing the land-use rights through public 
bidding while positively improving investment conditions. 
  The city government has also simplified formalities and 
improved services for overseas business people.

  [Text] The Xiamen Intermediate People's Court recently 
passed judgments of first incidence concerning the Wu Wenxin gun 
smuggling case, which has not been heard of for five years. Six 
Taiwan criminals were separately sentenced to death, life 
imprisonment, or jail terms. The case occurred in 1987. At 
that time Wu Wenxin, a resident of Penghu in Taiwan, 
collaborated with Zhang Liguo, deputy manager of a mainland 
export and import trading company, and other persons in planning 
and finding sources of firearms in Shenzhen, Beijing, Jinan, and 
Fuzhou. They successively smuggled a total of 1,900 firearms 
and 45,300 rounds of ammunitions, earning illegal profits worth 
$170,000. This case has attracted great attention from both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait. The Xiamen Municipal People's 
Procuratorate prosecuted these criminals in 1990.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Shi Saizhu (2514 6357 3796): "The </F>
Municipality Adopts Five Models for Experimentally Reforming 
State- Owned Assets"] 
  [Text] According to information gathered yesterday by this 
reporter from relevant departments, Shanghai is making sound 
progress in carrying out experimental reforms of state-owned 
assets according to five prescribed models, with the goal of 
verifying, stimulating, optimizing, and increasing stocks of 
assets, as well as invigorating enterprises to promote the 
economy. 
  It is understood that reforms of state-owned assets 
currently 
under way in Shanghai are generally proceeding in the following 
five ways: 
  1) Managing state-owned assets in accordance with the limits 
of authority regarding such assets, with the focus of current 
efforts being directed primarily at experimental reforms in 
large enterprise groups; 2) instituting a modern enterprise 
system, including the shareholding scheme, on an experimental 
basis, so that state-owned assets will genuinely occupy a 
"niche" in enterprises' assets structure; 3) further carrying 
out pilot projects in implementing the regulations on changing 
operating mechanisms and on overseeing and managing enterprises 
in the face of so many less-than-remarkable enterprises; 4) 
leasing, auctioning off, and merging small enterprises on an 
experimental basis; implementing a pilot stock cooperative 
system in those enterprises; and allowing the private sector to 
operate those enterprises on an experimental basis while 
maintaining state ownership; and 5) approaching deficit-ridden 
enterprises differently in light of differing circumstances. 
Examples of the last reform include breathing new life into 
enterprises that lose money temporarily, strengthening 
management over those enterprises, and encouraging them to 
increase profits; merging or adopting other approaches toward 
enterprises which conform to the course of industrial 
development but which cannot be changed in the near future; and 
experimenting with declaring backrupt enterprises which 
chronically lose money, cannot produce readily marketable 
products, and cannot be expected to turn deficits into profits. 
  People from relevant sectors said emphatically: In reforming 
state-owned assets on an experimental basis, we must ensure that 
such reforms are conducive to increasing the value of 
state-owned assets on the basis of the current value; to 
improving and invigorating enterprises so that they will truly 
become competitors in the market, with large enterprises 
becoming stronger, and small enterprises becoming more dynamic; 
and to readjusting the industrial structure and product mix.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 11 (XINHUA) -- J.P. Morgan Company of 
the United States, the Barings Group of Britain, the Bank of New 
York and other foreign consortiums have opened representative 
offices in Shanghai since the beginning of this year. 
  The Shanghai office of the Barings Group also serves as the 
China-based office of the European Consortium. 
  The Merrill Lynch Group of the United States, the largest 
securities brokerage company in the world, opened its Shanghai 
office in March 1993. 
  Since then representative offices have been opened by Credit 
Lyonnais Securities Company, the Peregrine Brokerage Company of 
Hong Kong, the Yamaichi International Company of Japan, the 
Daiwa Securities Company of Japan, the Nikko Securities Company 
of Japan and the Nomura International Company of Japan. 
  An economist in Shanghai said that overseas consortiums have 
been spurred into action by the rapid growth of the securities 
market in Shanghai. 
  Deals struck in the Shanghai Stock Exchange amounted to 500 
billion yuan in 1993, he said. 
  The exchange currently offers 161 types of A-shares, shares 
issued to Chinese to buy, up from only eight when it opened 
three years ago. It also offers 28 types of B-shares -- shares 
issued to foreigners to buy using hard currency. 
  A number of overseas consortiums are moving their Asian head 
offices or their China head offices from Hong Kong to Shanghai, 
the leading financial center in China, he said. 
  For example, in August 1993, Citibank of the United States 
moved its China head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai. 
  The Morgan Stanley Company of the United States, which 
opened 
a representative office here earlier this year, has decided to 
move its Asian head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai. 
  The economist said that other foreign consortiums which have 
not opened offices in Shanghai are trying to obtain trading 
seats in the Shanghai Stock Exchange so as to underwrite 
B-shares. 
  Overseas consortiums are playing a major role in issuing 
stocks and securities and helping China raise money, he said. 
  For example, in 1993 the Merrill Lynch Company undertook to 
issue shares worldwide for the Shanghai Petrochemical 
Corporation. Earlier this year, it undertook to issue bonds 
worth one billion U.S. dollars for the Chinese Government 
throughout the world.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai's exports are 
soaring this year. 
  According to the latest statistics, Shanghai, China's 
largest 
economic center, exported 2.464 billion U.S. dollars-worth of 
goods in the first four months of this year, an increase of 
26.64 percent over the same period of last year. 
  A municipal foreign trade official estimated that the city's 
exports will climb to 8.5 billion U.S. dollars this year, up 
15.4 percent over 1993 and exceeding the city's annual gross 
domestic product. 
  Shanghai's key export products include ships, complete sets 
of equipment, machine tools, sewing machines, containers, 
garments, toys and shoes. 
  In addition, the city has set up 420 trading and non-trading 
enterprises in more than 60 countries and regions to promote 
sales of Shanghai-made goods.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 10 (CNS) -- Shanghai's industrial 
production has risen further with its total industrial output 
value in April being RMB [renminbi] 35.275 billion, 3.7 percent 
up on that in March and 16 percent up over the same period last 
year. 
  Shanghai has set 12 percent for this year's GNP growth rate 
and the total industrial output value will have a growth rate of 
over 15 percent at least. In January this year, the industrial 
output value totalled RMB 19 billion, 13 percent up over the 
same period of last year. 
  Experts in Shanghai consider the reason for the rise in 
industrial production there was that the impact of macro-control 
and relevant reform measures adopted by the central government 
had eased in Shanghai and the economy there had started to 
operate as expected. In addition, achievements in the 
utilization of funds, market development and reform of 
state-owned enterprises were also part of the reason. 
  Production and marketing of Shanghai's industry increased at 
the same pace from January to April this year. The total 
industrial output value from January to April increased by 14.6 
percent over the same period of last year and the total sales 
value was 15.1 percent up. The ratio of production to sales was 
95.74 percent and in April this ratio reached 97.5 percent. 
  Experts, however, warned that the tasks of curbing inflation 
and reducing enterprise losses remained arduous. Shanghai Mayor 
Mr. Huang Ju said recently that pushing forward sales was the 
principal task. Meanwhile, arrangements for funds, utilization 
of foreign capital, and municipal engineering projects should 
also be well handled while certain reform measures would be 
implemented at the proper time.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of Zhejiang Provincial Report on the Execution </F>
of the 1993 Economic and Social Development Plan, and the Draft 
of the 1994 Economic and Social Development Plan -- by Zhang 
Qimei, vice governor of Zhejiang and chairman of the Provincial 
Planning and Economic Committee, at the Second Session of the 
Eighth Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress on 26 February 1994] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: 
  The provincial people's government asked me to report to you 
on the execution of the 1993 provincial economic and social 
development plan and the draft 1994 economic and social 
development plan. Please examine this report. 
<H5>  1. The Execution of the 1993 Plan </H5>
  In 1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
important talks and the guidelines laid down by the 14th 
National Party Congress, the vast number of cadres and people in 
Zhejiang continued to emancipate their minds, seize the 
opportunity, and speed up their pace of reform, opening up, and 
modernization. On the basis of the fairly high growth in 1992, 
the province continued to pick up speed in its economic 
development and achieved noticeable success in all social causes. 
  The economy continued to develop rapidly. It is 
expected that the gross domestic product [GDP] in 1993 will 
increase 25 percent over 1992, reaching 164.5 billion yuan. 
Agricultural production yielding high output of quality goods 
and high returns developed with gratifying results, village and 
town enterprises were developing faster while making 
improvements, and rural areas' economic vitality was even 
stronger. Industrial production maintained its high growth, and 
the value added by industry increased 40 percent, reaching 87 
billion yuan. Production and marketing were well coordinated, 
and the sales rate of industrial goods produced by enterprises 
operated by townships and larger areas reached 96 percent. The 
province's state-owned industries, the revenues of which were 
part of the budget resources, turned in 4.34 billion yuan of 
profit taxes, and the 28.8 percent increase was higher than the 
increase of their output value. Investments increased rather 
rapidly. Public investments in fixed assets grew 66.2 percent, 
reaching 60 billion yuan. Urban and rural markets thrived, the 
total retails of consumer goods increased 33.2 percent, reaching 
75.87 billion yuan. 
  Macroeconomic regulation and control yielded positive 
results. Implementing the guidelines laid down in the No. 6 
Document issued by the central authorities and proceeding from 
actual needs, the province gave priority to putting financial 
situation and taxation in order and to screening investments in 
fixed assets. In terms of banking operations, the amount of 
savings deposits by people in Zhejiang was 15 billion yuan more 
than that registered early in the year, or 3.78 billion yuan 
higher than that a year before [tong bi duo zeng 0681 3024 1122 
1073]. All banking institutions had a favorable balance. Funds 
needed for purchasing agricultural and sideline products were 
ensured. Financially, revenues increased faster, reaching 
16.656 billion yuan in the year, or 38.6 percent higher than a 
year ago; and expenditures were put under control. In the field 
of investment, the construction of many projects -- which were 
not in line with the state's industrial policy, which were 
unsure of capital and other resources, and for which the future 
was unclear -- were halted. Financial resources were pooled for 
supporting 21 capital construction projects and 169 
technological upgrading projects. Allotments of resources for 
key projects were more readily ensured. 
  Reforms continued to deepen. As required by the 
establishment of a socialist market economic system, efforts 
were made in reforming enterprises, market systems, government 
functions, and social security. With the removal of control 
over grain purchasing and market prices, agricultural production 
made the crucial step toward the market. Enterprises enjoyed 
greater autonomy following the implementation of the 
"Regulations Governing the Change of Operating Mechanisms in 
State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" and the provincial measures 
for implementing these regulations. Positive efforts were made 
in exploring feasibilities of reforming the system governing 
property ownership. The pace of building various types of 
market gathered speed. The construction of futures trade 
markets started, and markets of technology, information, 
personnel, real estate, and other goods and services for 
production continued to develop. The establishment of a social 
security system covering old age pension, insurance against 
unemployment, housing, and free medical services continued to 
proceed step by step. The restructuring of the planned economic 
system continued to deepen. All the provincial mandatory plans 
for industrial production were abolished. In the field of 
investment, investors were required to hold themselves 
responsible for their investment projects and invest according 
to contract; and the mechanisms governing investment became 
noticeably more efficient after measures binding investors to 
responsible for investment capital, construction projects, 
management, and repayment of loans themselves. 
  Important progress was made in infrastructural 
construction. Governments at various levels throughout the 
province attached great importance to the construction of 
projects in transportation, energy, communications, and other 
infrastructural facilities. They sought various ways to raise 
funds to increase their investment and speed up the pace of 
construction. The Xiaoshan Power Plant's 125,000-kw generating 
unit and 12 other key projects, including the Nantaitou 
floodgate in Nanpai along Hangjia Lake, were required to be 
completed and put into operation according to plan. They were 
completed and yielded results or partial results. The 
construction of the Jinhua-Wenzhou Railway was started. The 
Shaoxing section of the province's first highway that was 
self-designed and self-built, and whose funds were self-raised 
was completed and open to traffic. The construction of the 
Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway was accelerated. The construction of 
the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Double-Track Railway, the ore wharf at 
Beilun Harbor, the first-stage project of the Jiaxing Power 
Plant, the Yongning River-harnessing project, and the Shafan 
reservoir proceeded smoothly. The province built 560 kilometers 
of new highways and rebuilt 1,300 kilometers of first- or 
second-grade highways. Postal and telecommunications service at 
or above the county level was program-controlled, and the volume 
of such service doubled and redoubled. There were cellular 
telephones available in cities and counties. By the first 
quarter of this year, power plants installed an additional 
850,000 kw capacity. 
  New steps were taken in opening to the outside 
world. The State Council approved the establishment of the 
Hangzhou and Xiaoshan economic and technological development 
zones and a comprehensive development project on Daxie Island. 
The provincial government also approved the establishment of a 
number of economic development zones, including the Jinhua 
Economic Development Zone, and the building of Zhapu and three 
other secondary ports. In 1993, $1.033 billion in foreign funds 
was directly used, an increase of 251.3 percent and more than 
the total of the previous 14 years. The total volume of export 
trade amounted to $4.439 billion, up 19.9 percent. 
  Social undertakings continuously developed. There 
were 297 achievements in scientific research which won 
provincial-level awards for scientific and technological 
progress, and noticeable results were achieved in using 
scientific-research achievements in production. The enrollment 
in universities and special or technical secondary schools 
increased more than 30 percent over 1992. The construction of 
the provincial museum, the Hemudu Museum, and other cultural 
projects were completed and put to use. Zhejiang radio and 
television programs were transmitted through satellite. New 
achievements were scored in family planning. By the end of the 
year, the province's population was 43.348 million, and the 
natural population growth rate was 7.03 per thousand. The 
incomes of people in both urban and rural areas increased. The 
annual average amount of per capita income that city dwellers 
used for living expenses was 3,371 yuan, and the net per capita 
income of residents in rural areas was 1,746 yuan, increasing 15 
percent and 10.3 percent respectively after allowing for price 
rises. 
  While fully affirming our achievements, we should also note 
soberly that there exist contradictions and new problems in our 
economic life. They mainly are: (1) Although much has been 
done in readjusting the structure, the structure as a whole is 
not rational enough. We have optimized the variety and 
structure of agricultural production and also increased the 
production of quality, famous-brand, new, and special products, 
but the acreage sown to grain crops has reduced, and so has 
their output. Agriculture as the foundation of the national 
economy is not solid enough, the industrial structure is not 
readjusted quickly enough, and there are still substandard 
construction, and a number of projects without bright market 
prospects. Tangible results have been achieved in the 
construction of transportation and power projects; however, 
supply still falls far short of demand in these regards. The 
development of tertiary industry lags behind economic 
development, and its internal structure has yet to be improved. 
(2) Although the total amounts of profits and taxes have grown 
rather rapidly, the economic returns of industries as a whole 
are not sufficiently ideal. Enterprises that have made profits 
are mainly those producing goods for investment, and the profits 
of general enterprises have fallen. (3) Increased Prices have 
not dropped. The annual retail price index increased 16.7 
percent, affecting in varying degrees the lives of residents in 
both urban and rural areas. The above problems merit our close 
attention, and we should take effective measures to solve them 
step by step in the new year. 
  2. Basic Requirements Set For Economic and Social 
Development in 1994 
  This year is important for following through with the 
guidelines laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, and for continuing with the reform for 
establishing a socialist market economic system; a crucial year 
for maintaining the good momentum of Zhejiang's economic growth 
and carrying out the Eighth Five-Year Plan; and a year with 
formidable missions to carry out in alleviating inflation and 
maintaining social stability while speeding up reforms and 
development. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening 
wider to the outside world, expediting development, and 
maintaining stability are requirements of overall importance 
this year. While proceeding with this year's economic 
projects, we must comprehensively follow through with the 
guidelines laid down by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee and the ninth provincial conference of 
party representatives, continue to emancipate our minds, seize 
the opportunity, deepen reforms, build a stronger foundation, 
broaden the market, improve quality, and push forward our 
sustained, rapid and healthy economic development so as to bring 
about a coordinated economic and social development and attain 
the targets in the Eighth Five-Year Plan one year ahead of 
time. To achieve this guideline, we should properly handle 
the relationship in the following sectors: 
  First, we should properly handle the relationship 
between reforms and development. While we must follow the 
guideline of seizing the opportunity and speed up development 
when we set targets and make other arrangements for this year's 
economic growth, we must make sure there will be room and the 
means for alleviating pressure from inflation and ensuring the 
implementation of various measures for reform. We must consider 
deepening reform as the fundamental dynamic for pushing economic 
development forward and expediting the reforms for establishing 
a modern enterprise system, market system, and improving major 
systems governing financial affairs, taxation, banking 
operations, investment, foreign trade, foreign exchange, and the 
management of state-owned assets. During the course of reforms, 
we must also properly handle the relationship between various 
sectors. We must, in particular, work meticulously in 
coordinating the new and old systems and various reform 
projects, as well as the relationship between reforms, 
development, and stability. 
  Second, we must properly handle the relationship 
between growth, structure, and returns. During the course 
of economic development, we must guard against the tendency of 
pursuing output value and launching new projects 
unrealistically. We must direct our attention to building a 
stronger foundation, reaching a higher level, achieving higher 
returns, broadening markets at home and abroad, and opening up 
our economic sector even wider. We must continue to build a 
stronger infrastructure, stabilize agricultural development, 
rationally readjust the industrial structure, and speed up the 
development of tertiary industries. 
  Third, we must properly handle the relationship between 
economic development and social progress. We must firmly 
establish the idea that economic and social development must be 
coordinated, and we make sure that efforts for promoting 
economic growth must be more closely integrated with efforts for 
maintaining social stability and promoting social progress. 
While focusing on economic development, we must attach great 
importance to scientific-technological and educational 
development as well as the development of other social causes so 
as to promote social stability. 
  In view of these requirements, the main targets set in the 
draft provincial economic and social development plan for 1994 
are: 
  1. The GDP will be 202.5 billion yuan, an increase of 12 
percent over 1993; and the growth of tertiary industries will be 
higher than 12 percent. 
  2. Budgetary local incomes will increase 10.1 percent, 
reaching 8.02 billion yuan. 
  3. Public investment in fixed assets will increase 20 
percent, reaching 72 billion yuan. 
  4. Total retail value of consumer goods will increase 22 
percent, reaching 82.8 billion yuan. 
  5. Total exports will increase 12 percent, reaching $4.97 
billion. 
  6. The rise of the total retail price level will be 
controlled at about 12 percent. 
  7. The natural population growth rate will be controlled 
to under 8.39 per one thousand. 
<H5>  3. Major Economic Plans and Measures </H5>
  (1) Strengthen the Role of Agriculture as the 
Foundation of the National Economy, and Bring About an Allround 
Rural Economic Development. While promoting economic 
development, we must always give top priority to agriculture, 
bring about economic prosperity in rural areas, and increase 
peasants' income through speeding up the development of 
agriculture that yields high output of quality products which 
can bring in high returns. Our plan requires that the value 
added by agriculture be 2.8 percent higher than that of 1993. 
  To strengthen the fundamental role of agriculture and 
develop the rural economy, the most basic requirement is to 
implement all party policies for rural areas and proceed with 
all reform projects in rural areas so that agriculture and rural 
economy can be gradually brought into the orbit of the socialist 
market economy. Our main economic plans are: First, while 
restructuring agriculture and developing forestry, animal 
husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, we will stabilize 
the size of crop acreage, the multiple crop index, and the 
output of such major crops as grain, cotton, and oil-bearing 
products. According to the requirement of "achieving basic 
self-sufficiency and adjusting surpluses and shortages," the 
size of grain acreage will be maintained at 43 million mu and 
the total grain output should be maintained at about 15 million 
tonnes. Some funds and loans on favorable terms will be 
arranged for supporting principal grain producing areas to 
promote new and quality species and techniques for achieving 
higher yield, and for supporting major grain producers in 
carrying out sizable production. Arable land must be more 
strongly protected and its use must be rational. No more than 
10,000 hectares of arable land can be used for construction 
purposes. Second, the prices for purchasing grain and cotton 
must be increased, additional payments should be added to set 
prices, funds should be established against risks in grain 
production, and a system of reserving grain should also be 
established. Regions designated to reserve grain should be 
rationally distributed. According to plan, part of the 
province's reserved grain should be transferred from production 
areas to marketing areas. Third, industries supporting 
agriculture must make positive efforts to operate efficiently 
and make sure that supply of capital goods for agricultural 
production is ensured. Policies and measures for supporting 
production of chemical fertilizers should continue. Fourth, more 
resources will be invested in agricultural production through 
various channels. Levies for the special fund set up for 
building irrigation facilities will be collected throughout 
Zhejiang in accordance with the provincial government's 
"Procedures for Raising Capital for Renovating Mainstay 
Irrigation Facilities on the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou Plain Along 
the Tai Hu Basin." The basic quotas set for small hydroelectric 
power stations to contribute power to the power grid will be 
abolished. A certain percentage of the electricity surcharge 
collected by small hydroelectric power stations built with state 
investment will be withheld for establishing a foundation for 
the development of small hydroelectric power stations. 
Preferential treatment should also be given to agriculture in 
terms of budgets and loans. The masses should be organized to 
build capital irrigation facilities for agriculture. The 
renovation of the Jinqingxin, Yongningjiang, and Dongjin 
watergates and the Shafan and Wanyaohe dams as well as for 
controlling the Qian Tang Jiang, as well as the preparations for 
building the Shanxi water conservancy project and other mainstay 
projects should be expedited. Fifth, programs for supporting 
impoverished areas will be strengthened and improved. Funds 
should be raised from all quarters for building infrastructures, 
launching comprehensive agricultural development projects, and 
upgrading industrial technology in impoverished counties. 
  (2) Deepen enterprise reform and strive for efficient 
and high growth in industrial production. This year's 
industrial production is confronted with two outstanding 
problems concerning market and returns. To achieve a sustained 
industrial growth, reform must be considered as the dynamics for 
integrating these three areas -- production and distribution, 
domestic and foreign trade, and enterprises and markets -- 
focusing on broadening the market and achieving higher returns. 
We must do a good job in broadening the market, restructuring 
industrial production, improving management, and reducing 
enterprises' burdens. It has been planned that value added by 
industry will increase 17 percent, and sales of industrial 
enterprises operated by townships and larger areas will increase 
15 percent. 
  First, enterprises must be more market conscious and they 
must give priority to broadening the market and promoting sales. 
The sales rate of industrial enterprises operated by townships 
and larger areas should be at least 96 percent. Enterprises 
must strive to improve their market survey, forecast, and 
analysis. They must make great efforts to develop marketable 
new products, and strive to increase output of quality, brand 
name products. They must firmly stop or switch the production 
of energy-inefficient and unmarketable goods of poor quality 
that pollute the environment. Three measures should be taken to 
guide departments and enterprises at various levels to direct 
their attention to broadening the market and achieving higher 
returns: 1) Continue to reform industrial plans. While 
provincial authorities will no longer issue mandatory plans for 
industrial production, both the types and the quantities of 
goods produced under state plans should be further reduced. 2) 
Value of industrial sales and value added by industry will be 
used to replace the value of gross industrial output, which will 
no longer be publicized externally from now on. 3) Evaluation 
of industrial sales rates will be intensified. Enterprises with 
sales rates one percentage point below the provincial average 
will be warned. With the exception of some special trades and 
enterprises, the production of which is seasonal, measures 
should be taken to restrict the production of enterprises whose 
sales rate is below 93 percent. 
  Second, we must rely on scientific and technological 
advancement to quicken industrial restructuring. We should 
actively develop and utilize new technologies, new crafts, and 
new materials, as well as strive to produce a group of high 
quality and strongly competitive products. We should reorganize 
Zhejiang's advantages in traditional industries such as 
machinery, electronics, textile, food, chemical, building 
materials, and construction. We should effectively develop the 
electronics information sector centered on communications 
equipment and computers; the machinery industry centered on 
transportation equipment and engineering machinery; as well as 
the chemical industry centered on new-type synthetic materials 
and fine chemical products to gradually establish new advantages 
in our industries. It is necessary to vigorously strengthen 
scientific and technological undertakings of enterprises as well 
as give special support to enterprise groups and large and 
medium enterprises that possess the capability to establish 
technology centers. 
  Third, we must stress quality and efficiency and strengthen 
enterprise management. We will hold activities in "changing 
enterprise operating mechanism, improving enterprises' internal 
management and operations, and increasing efficiency" in the 
entire province. We should improve the enterprise quality 
management system and social quality supervision system. We 
will hold the "1994 Zhejiang Quality Drive" activities and 
continue to support the production of excellent and branded 
goods while cracking down on fake and inferior-quality products. 
We should strengthen cost accounting, quicken fund turnover, 
conserve energy, and minimize wastes. Industries at 
village-level and above should ensure that their circulation 
funds turn over at least two times, increase overall labor 
productivity by 17 percent, and lower comprehensive energy 
consumption for every 10,000 yuan of output value by five 
percent. We should continue to do a good job in reducing losses 
and increasing profits. We must ensure safety in production by 
strengthening safety and fire prevention in transportation, 
mines, foreign enterprises, and enterprise units owned by other 
sectors to prevent major accidents. 
  Fourth, we must adopt practical measures to reduce 
enterprises' burdens. We should allow enterprises 
self-governing rights, and resolutely halt wanton fund raising, 
wanton apportionment of expenses, and wanton fee collection from 
enterprises. We should screen and reduce irrational debt 
burdens of some enterprises. We should supplement enterprises 
with circulation funds through various channels. We should 
transfer some of the social service functions of enterprises to 
reduce their duties in society by vigorously developing tertiary 
industry. 
  To strive for high efficiency and rapid growth in industrial 
production, it is necessary to establish a modern enterprise 
system and quicken enterprise reform. This year, a group of 
state-owned large and medium enterprises with fairly good 
performances will be selected from the province as pilot 
enterprises for experiments in modern enterprise system. The 
main task of these enterprises is to actively deepen reform in 
accordance with modern enterprise system. 
  First, it is necessary to continue to deepen the 
implementation of the "Regulations on Transforming the 
Management Mechanisms of State-owned Enterprises" and the 
"Implementation Methods" for enterprises to truly perform their 
various operations, rights, and responsibilities. 
  Second, it is necessary to further regulate enterprises' 
property rights. In accordance with the "Company Law," large- 
and medium- sized enterprises will be reorganized into limited 
shareholding and limited liability companies. In particular, we 
will establish inter-trade and inter-regional enterprise groups 
with public ownership as the mainstay, and with property rights 
as the major link among them. To change the operating 
mechanisms of medium- and small-sized enterprises, we should 
adopt several flexible and efficient methods such as 
shareholding, having state enterprises run privately, and 
leasing. Mergers, auctions, and bankruptcy proceedings for 
small, poor, and deficit-ridden enterprises should be quickened. 
It is necessary to try establishing state asset operating 
companies and property rights trading markets. In the course of 
reforming the enterprise property rights system, it is necessary 
to strengthen the supervision and management of the property of 
state enterprises. Village and town collectives and enterprises 
should also enthusiastically and steadily promote reform in a 
wider scope based mainly on the shareholding system. It is 
necessary to encourage the development of individual, private, 
and foreign-funded businesses, as well as strengthen the 
guidance and control over these business endeavors. 
  Third, it is necessary to further reform the distribution 
system. On the one hand, we should, in accordance with the new 
financial and taxation system, readjust the distributions of the 
state and enterprises, particularly the effective transition 
from the contract system to the unified income tax system. In 
addition, we should study and formulate methods for supporting 
enterprises' technological modifications and new product 
development under the new situation. On the other, we should 
guide enterprises in further invigorating their internal wage 
distribution system. On the principle of prioritizing 
efficiency while giving similar consideration to fairness, we 
should introduce a competition mechanism that will rationally 
bring about differences in workers' wages. It is necessary to 
attach importance to protecting workers' rights and interests as 
well as arouse the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers to 
participate and support reform. 
  Fourth, it is necessary to quicken the pace in establishing 
and improving a multilevel social security system, emphatically 
improve the enterprise pension and unemployment insurance 
systems, and vigorously advance reform of the housing, medical, 
and other social security systems. 
  Fifth, it is necessary to conscientiously strengthen 
guidance 
for the organization of enterprise reform as well as 
experimental work. We should carry out project "5100" across the 
province and strive to attain the objective of realizing the two 
"thirds" in reform. That is to say, we are to commend and 
recommend to society 100 "double- good enterprises" with good 
showings in transforming operating mechanisms and in operating 
efficiency; to keep track of 100 enterprises operating in the 
red; to embark on experimental transformation of 100 limited 
companies wholly owned, controlled, or invested in by the state; 
to experimentally implement the assets management responsibility 
system in 100 state-owned enterprises; to form 100 provincial 
and city-level business conglomerates; as well as to strive to 
implement, by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, the 
corporate system in one-third of state-owned enterprises and the 
cooperative share-holding system in one-third of urban 
collective enterprises. 
  (3) Vigorously develop an open economy and promote 
opening up to the outside world to get it to develop in depth 
and toward a higher level and broader sectorial base. We 
should try hard to keep up the momentum of rapid growth in 
foreign capital utilization. It is necessary to, based on the 
state industrial policy and the actual situation in the 
province, further define industrial orientation for foreign 
investment; expand the field of investment; as well as reserve 
and introduce selectively a number of infrastructure and basic 
industrial projects such as power generation and wharf and road 
construction, a number of export-oriented and 
foreign-exchange-earning agricultural development projects, a 
number of old town reconstruction and large-scale land 
development projects, and a number of technological 
transformation projects for traditional industries and projects 
in the heavy, chemical, and high- and new-technology industries. 
We should continue to expand the solicitation of foreign 
investment in various forms at different levels through 
diversified channels. Special efforts should be made in seeking 
direct investment by major companies and enterprises with 
international prestige. It is necessary to heedfully give play 
to the potential for indirectly utilizing foreign capital, 
strive to get a number of major projects included in 
international financial organizations and foreign governments' 
lending plans, and make full and good use of international 
commercial loans we borrow and repay on our own. We should take 
good charge of the tracking and implementation of projects with 
a confirmed contract, strengthen administration of 
foreign-invested enterprises in accordance with the law, and 
work hard to upgrade work quality and efficiency in utilizing 
foreign capital. In building development zones, we should 
insist on having a high starting point, high standards, and high 
efficiency; pay attention to the rationality of planning; 
attentively check the level of projects; and ensure full 
utilization of every development zone to give full play to their 
demonstrative and radiative role. 
  We should further develop trade and economic and 
technological cooperation with other countries. We should do a 
good job in replacing the old structure with a new one in order 
to meet the needs of reform of the systems for foreign trade and 
foreign exchange. While effectively running foreign trade 
enterprises at the provincial level, we should continue to 
encourage foreign trade enterprises at the city and county 
levels, individually owned production enterprises with foreign 
trade licenses, and the three kinds of partially or wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises to earn more foreign exchange by 
exporting more goods. According to the requirements for market 
diversification and with product quality as a top concern, we 
should further open markets in Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea, the 
United States, Russian, and other countries and regions while 
striving to consolidate our existing markets. We should make 
vigorous efforts to increase the sources of goods and do a good 
job in exporting machinery, electronic products, extensively 
processed textile and light-industrial products, high-technology 
products, as well as traditional and special handicraft 
articles. Efforts should be made to improve the quality and 
grades of products. We should continue to develop international 
tourism and contract construction projects and provide 
designing consulting and labor services abroad in order to 
increase non-trade earnings. We should rationally readjust the 
export structure, improve foreign trade management, and give 
priority to exporting major products and importing technologies 
and equipment for key projects. 
  We should further research and implement plans for the 
regional economy, the industrial structure, and the distribution 
of major projects in order to connect the domestic market with 
the international market and develop an open economy. We should 
gradually make an overall plan for developing three economic 
areas along the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway, in the 
coastal Wenzhou-Taizhou region, and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi 
and Jinghua-Wenzhou Railways, in the light of the requirements 
for relying on major cities and main lines of communication for 
economic development. We should link with Pudong, develop major 
cities, strengthen various counties' economies, develop coastal 
and mountainous areas, and improve the pattern for opening to 
the outside world and the distribution of productive forces. 
With the international economy as the background, we should 
profoundly study and improve plans for the development of 
transportation, electric power, communications, machinery, 
electronics, light and textile industries, chemical industry, 
construction materials, medicine, metallurgical industry, and 
other major industries as well as tertiary industry. We should 
research key capital construction projects, technical 
transformation, and joint ventures and set forth a list of 
reserve projects on the basis of feasibility studies. As for 
existing key projects, we should further analyze their market 
prospects and possible economic returns and then take 
appropriate measures in this regard. 
<H5>  4. Reform the Investment Structure and Increase Investment </H5>
in Infrastructure, Basic Industries, and Major 
Technical-Transformation Projects 
  Overall, the amount of this year's investment is large 
enough. It is important to optimize the investment structure and 
concentrate financial and material resources on the construction 
of key projects. 
  The increased investment in capital construction is mainly 
to 
be used for agriculture, water conservancy projects, 
transportation, energy, communications, important raw and 
semifinished materials, science and technology, and education. 
We should increase investment in key projects listed in the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan. In carrying out technical 
transformation, we should ensure quality and the carrying out of 
major projects. We should pay close attention to optimizing the 
structure, improve quality, and lower consumption of raw 
materials. We should improve the levels of equipment and 
technology and quickly carry out a number of key 
technical-transformation projects and the project for 
transforming the silk industry, which was included in the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan. 
  We will seriously implement the State Council's "Circular 
on Continuing To Strengthen Macroeconomic Regulation and Control 
Over Fixed Assets Investment." On the basis of last year's 
screening and examination of construction projects, we should 
properly set the order of precedence and give higher priority to 
completion of key projects, to putting completed projects into 
operation, and to continuing the construction of unfinished key 
projects. Those projects which were canceled or suspended last 
year must not be restored if without proper authorization. 
Infrastructure and basic industry projects should also be built 
according to a unified plan and a rational geographic 
distribution. We should stress economic efficiency, do what we 
are capable of, concentrate efforts on major projects, and avoid 
blind and repetitive construction. We should improve the 
administrative work of examining and approving requests for new 
projects. According to the State Council's regulations, the 
power to examine and approve projects is not to be divided 
laterally, nor delegated to all lower levels. With the 
exception of the projects which the State Council has authorized 
the national-level development zones to examine and approve and 
the projects which enterprises may examine and approve according 
to "Regulations on Transforming the Operational Mechanisms of 
State-Owned Industrial Enterprises," local projects must be 
examined and approved by the local government's planning 
committee (planing and economic committee) and economic 
committee. Investment in real estate development should be 
included in the overall fixed assets investment plan, and the 
land used for the purpose should be placed under a special 
management. The execution of an investment plan must be 
seriously supervised, and projects not covered by the plan shall 
receive no funding from the finance department, nor shall they 
obtain loans from banks. The departments concerned should 
ensure timely funding for major construction projects and 
technological transformation projects according the construction 
plan and engineering progress. It is necessary to build well a 
number of major projects. It is necessary to organize an 
efficient work force and pay attention to fund raising, 
coordination, and construction progress. It is necessary to 
implement the open bidding system, perform a modern management 
of designing and engineering jobs, and ensure good engineering 
quality. Besides agricultural and water resources projects, we 
are building the following capital construction projects: major 
transport projects -- the Jinhua-Wenzhou railroad, 
double-tracking of the Xiaoshan-Ningbo railroad, double-tracking 
of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railroad, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo 
express highway, Zhujiajian airfield, the Taizhou section of the 
Ningbo-Taizhou-Wenzhou express highway, and two bridges on the 
Ou Jiang in Wenzhou; energy source projects -- the first-stage 
construction of the Beilun power plant, the first-stage 
construction of the Jiaxing power plant, the Xiaoshan power 
plant, the Changxing power plant, the fourth-stage construction 
of the Taizhou power plant, the Yuxi power station, the 
Tianhuangping pumped hydroelectric storage power station, the 
Beishaoping transformer station and transmission line; and raw 
and processed materials projects -- the Zhejiang acrylics fiber 
plant, the Zhejiang chemical plant, the Quzhou chemical company, 
the Zhejiang polyester fiber plant. We should continue to 
accelerate the construction of telecommunications projects and 
strive to increase the total number of telephones to 3 million 
and basically complete the C3 local network by the end of the 
year. In addition, we are building a number of other projects, 
including urban water and gas supply projects and infrastructure 
projects on coastal islets and in mountainous regions. We 
should continue to accelerate the preparatory work for the 
construction of Hangzhou's Xiaoshan international airport, the 
Hangzhou-Jinhua-Quzhou highway, the Sanmen nuclear power plant, 
the Yanhai thermoelectric power plant, the Beilun steel plant. 
We should make preparations for starting the construction of 
the 600,000-ton catalytic cracking project, the first stage of 
Wenzhou's Qili harbor, and the second stage of the Wenzhou power 
plant. Our major technological transformation projects include 
the Hangzhou Iron and Steel Plant, the Hangzhou Oxygen Plant, 
the Shaoxing Electronic Tubes Plant, the Minfeng Paper Mill and 
the Huafeng Paper Mill. 
  The fundamental motive force for maximizing investment 
structure and enhancing investment profits lies in accelerating 
the reform of the investment system. Main efforts should be 
made on the following three links: 
  First, a responsibility system for investment risks should 
be 
established and improved. Great efforts should be made to carry 
out the responsibility system of enterprises as a legal entity. 
In the future, the subject responsible for any risks in the 
investment projects should be clearly defined first. A 
share-holding system in which legal persons can hold their 
shares shall be universally promoted so as to establish a 
clear-cut property ownership. Trans-regional large construction 
projects should be built by specialized companies. Such 
companies shall be organized by the government, with part of 
their shares owned and controlled by the government. Funds for 
building regional transportation facilities and other 
infrastructural construction projects should be raised by 
localities which are also responsible for the operation, 
profits, and losses of these projects. But localities should be 
careful in the planning, operation, and management of these 
projects. Zhejiang Province and localities in the province must 
join their venture in building more power stations. Those who 
invest more in building power stations are entitled to get more 
profits. 
  Second, it is necessary to improve the control of total 
investment volume and structure by consolidating the sources of 
construction funds. While introducing some necessary 
fund-raising policies, we should strengthen the overall control 
of various construction funds as well as formulate and improve 
relevant management measures. In this way, we can ensure that 
what is taken from the people is rational, that the operation of 
the projects is standardized, and that the funds for key 
projects are sufficient. Active efforts should be made to expand 
the functions of those banking institutions formed by Zhejiang 
government and various localities in the province. We should 
explore ways to establish a local investment and banking system. 
  Third, it is necessary to establish a system for registering 
fixed asset investment projects. To strengthen the supervision 
and control of total investment volume and structure, any 
investment projects exceeding a certain investment limit should 
file with the departments in charge of investment planning and 
management for the record. 
<H5>  5. Work Hard To Control Commodity Price and Improve </H5>
People's Living Standard 
  While carrying out price reform, it is necessary to work 
hard 
to curb the over-rapid inflation, continue to improve people's 
living standard, and promote social stability. 
  First of all, great efforts should be made to ensure the 
production and supply of people's basic necessities, specially 
that of rice and vegetables. We should uphold the role of grain 
and commercial departments as well as supply and marketing units 
as a main channel and further integrate the effort of improving 
business management with that of implementing the 
policy-oriented tasks. We should ensure that current vegetable 
production bases will not be used for building capital 
construction projects. If there is a real need for this 
purpose, we should find double acreage for the farmland lost. 
In light of agricultural development policy, we should develop 
new secondary and tertiary vegetable bases. In order to 
stabilize hog production, we should adopt necessary assistance 
policies to enlarge mass production. While stabilizing 
vegetable and hog production, we should spend great efforts to 
promote the production of poultry, egg, and aquatic products. 
  Second, the supervision over and control of the market 
should 
be strengthened. We should establish and improve a system for 
reserving and supplying important materials used for production 
and daily life, and intervene in a timely fashion if there are 
abnormal fluctuations in the market. Prices for important 
commodities which have great bearing on people's livelihood and 
service charges should be reported to relevant authorities for 
the record or for authorization. Market management should be 
strengthened and improved. 
  Third, we should make efforts to increase people's incomes. 
Every effort should be made so that their income growth will be 
higher than the increase of commodity prices. We must pay 
particular attention to taking care of the livelihood of 
retirees, workers of enterprises which have production and 
operation problems, and peasants in impoverished areas. We must 
gradually improve the people's living conditions. In 
conjunction with urban areas' housing reform, we should build 
more affordable housing units for people with average incomes 
and units for easing housing congestion, as well as temporary 
housing units. 
<H5>  6. We Must Act on the Guideline That Science and Technology </H5>
Are the Primary Productive Forces, and Closely Integrate Science 
and Technology With Economic Construction 
  We should popularize certain scientific and technological 
achievements which can be widely applied, which have high added 
value, and which have significant guiding functions; and we 
should render our support for the project in terms of investment 
and credit. We must actively restructure the management of 
science and technology, encourage and support the establishment 
of all types of nongovernment research institutions, and 
increase investment in scientific and technological development 
projects in various ways. 
  We must give priority to educational development, which must 
be regarded as a strategic mission, and speed up the training of 
all types of proficient personnel. We must continue to 
strengthen basic education and promote the nine-year compulsory 
education in areas with 90 percent of Zhejiang's total 
population. We must make great efforts to promote vocational, 
adult, and special education; improve the educational structure; 
promote cooperation; and steadily develop higher education. It 
has been planned that ordinary schools of higher education and 
technical secondary schools will enroll respectively 23,500 and 
36,000 students this year. We must restructure the educational 
system and encourage and support social sectors and 
nongovernment organs to raise funds for setting up all types of 
schools. We must give schools greater management autonomy and 
speed up the pace of restructuring the enrollment system and the 
system of placing graduates. We should continue to raise funds 
through all channels so that there will be more money for 
educational investment. 
  We must make overall planning and speed up the development 
of 
all social causes, such as cultural affairs, news reporting, 
publishing, radio and television broadcasting, public health, 
sports, tourism, and protection of the handicapped. We must 
intensify environmental protection and improve the ecology. We 
should build stronger infrastructures essential for speeding up 
scientific-technological, educational, and social development. 
We should speed up the expansion of the provincial association 
of science and technology, and the construction of the 
provincial hospital of Chinese medicine, the provincial radio 
building, and the provincial physical education and sports 
commission's laboratory; and launch the construction of the 
provincial library,the Huanglongdong sports center, the 
ZHEJIANG RIBAO building, the provincial senior citizens' 
activity center, and the provincial women and children activity 
center. 
  We believe that, with the efforts exerted by people in 
Zhejiang, we certainly will be able to accomplish all tasks set 
in the 1994 economic and social development plan.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 11 (XINHUA) -- In the first quarter 
this year, more than 22,000 new employees were hired by 
self-employed households in south China's Guangdong Province. 
  The number of registered self-employed households reached 
1.22 million with 2.24 million employees. 
  Registered funds per household in Guangdong averaged 9,170 
yuan, increasing by 5.1 percent over the average fund at the end 
of 1993. 
  With the development of the socialist market economic 
structure, governments at various levels in Guangdong have set 
great store by the growth of self-employed households. 
  The governments in Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Shaoguan, Jiangmen 
and Zhuhai cities have set preferential policies to support the 
development of this type of private economy. 
  Meanwhile, Guangdong Province has also accelerated 
construction of market places for the activities of 
self-employed households. 
  In 1993, the provinces constructed more than 400 market 
places with an area of about 2 million square meters. 
  In the first three months, the business volume of 
self-employed households in Guangdong exceeded 10 billion yuan, 
and retail sales of the households were 6.88 billion yuan, 
accounting for 17.73 percent of the total retail sales of the 
province.

  [Text] While making an inspection tour in Zhengzhou's New 
and Hi-Tech Development Zone this morning, Governor Ma Zhongchen 
pointed out: Development zones should operate in accordance 
with the requirements for establishing a new socialist market 
economy system and with international practice. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen; (Zhang Deguang), member of the 
provincial party committee standing committee and secretary of 
the Zhengzhou city party committee; and others inspected 
development and construction in the Zhengzhou Development Zone, 
including its commercial and trade, oil depot, financial, and 
industrial districts. 
  Over the past five years, the Zhengzhou Development Zone has 
developed its four major undertakings, including 
microelectronics, biological pharmacy, [words indistinct], and 
new building material industries. There are more than 200 
enterprises in the zone, half of which are foreign-funded 
enterprises. Last year, the zone's industrial production output 
value reached more than 600 million yuan, and is expected to 
increase to 1.5 billion yuan this year. 
  Governor Ma Zhongchen emphasized: The Zhengzhou Development 
Zone's overall planning is rational, and its infrastructure is 
complete. It has various kinds of economic sectors, and does 
business in various ways. Its management mechanisms are 
flexible, and its secondary and tertiary industries are 
developing fairly effectively. 
  He added: The development zone is an inevitable result of 
the development of productive forces, and an inexorable product 
of the development of the socialist market economy at a certain 
stage, and a new economic growing point as well. In the course 
of moving our agricultural economy to industrialization and 
urbanization, special zones can play a leading role. 
  He emphasized: We must show concern for and support 
development zones. Under unified planning, we must vigorously 
promote development zones. Not long ago, we had too many 
development zones, and the situation was chaotic. This was 
mainly due to a lack of experience and practice. We must not 
waver in our determination to promote development zones in order 
to improve the above-mentioned situation. In the future, in 
places where conditions exist, development zones must continue 
to be built. We must not give up eating for fear of choking. 
In the meantime, we must prevent some places from arbitrarily 
building development zones regardless of their own conditions. 
The chaotic situation of building too many development zones 
also must be avoided. The progress of development zones must be 
put on the normal course. Governor Ma Zhongchen also inspected 
the progress of an overpass project on Waihuan Road in 
Zhengzhou. He asked the relevant responsible persons to convey 
his regards to the cadres and workers who are working on the 
project, and to their family members. He hoped that they would 
construct the overpass well, with good quality and a high grade 
of work guaranteed.

  [Text] By 1 May, the city of Zhengzhou had sold 380 
million yuan worth of treasury bonds, including 60 million yuan 
worth of two-year bonds and 320 million yuan worth of three-year 
bonds. 
  Zhengzhou party and government leaders have attached 
importance to promoting the sales of treasury bonds this year. 
On 30 March, the city government held a special mobilization 
meeting to promote treasury bond sales. Quotas were assigned 
and the responsibilities of relevant units were defined. 
Various relevant units responsible for selling treasury bonds 
have taken strengthening service and providing convenience for 
buyers as their guideline to make early and full preparations 
for promotion work. 
  Various specialized banks also have strengthened internal 
management to assign tasks to various levels, based on the 
responsibility system. They have extended business hours, so 
that buyers can buy treasury bonds at any sales point at any 
time they like. By 1 May, some sales points already had 
fulfilled their tasks.

  [Excerpt] Compared with the same period last year, our 
province's foreign trade and exports increased by a bigger 
margin in the first quarter this year. By the end of March, the 
province's overall export volume reached more than $310 million, 
an increase of 25.6 percent over the same period last year. 
  In the first quarter of this year, our province's foreign 
trade and exports had the following features: The export growth 
rates of various export enterprises were uneven. The export 
volumes of specialized companies in our province felld, whereas 
industrial and commercial exports at the prefectural and city 
levels rose by a bigger margin. The exports of foreign-funded 
enterprises maintained their strong growth. In the first 
quarter, foreign-funded enterprises' export volumes reached 
$37.44 million, registering an increase of 450 percent over the 
corresponding period last year. This margin of increase was much 
higher than the average growth rate of foreign-funded 
enterprises throughout the country. 
  With regard to the main countries and areas to which our 
province's products were exported, our exports to the 
traditional Hong Kong and Macao markets fell, while our exports 
to the EC countries increased fairly rapidly. [passage omitted

  [Text] Zhengzhou, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Henan 
Province is determined to help the 7.6 million of its people who 
live below the poverty line cast off poverty by the end of the 
century, senior provincial officials said. 
  The goal was forwarded in a recent plan of the provincial 
government, corresponding to a similar plan newly made public by 
the central government. 
  According to the plan, the province will inject nine million 
yuan every year into poverty-relief projects in the six poorest 
counties in addition to funds from the central government for 
the 28 poorest counties in the province. 
  Though painstaking efforts over the past eight years have 
reduced the province's impoverished population from 13 million 
to 7.6 million, the figure still accounts for one tenth of the 
national total, the officials admitted. 
  By the end of 1993 the province still had 4,800 villages 
whose per-capita incomes were under 300 yuan a year, the 
official-set poverty line. 
  The officials said most of the impoverished people live in 
places where the natural conditions are harsh, either too 
mountainous or often hit by floods or drought, or where endemic 
diseases are rampant. 
  The province still has over one million people and 400,000 
head of domestic animals afflicted by water shortages, 2,300 
villages inaccessible to motor traffic and 1,600 villages 
without electricity, the officials said. 
  Large enterprises will also be encouraged to help poor areas 
develop their own industries, as they have the technicians, 
technologies and market information that poor areas often lack. 
  In addition, cities may be paired, the ones with relatively 
better developed economies helping the poorer ones in 
technology, marketing and training of technicians, the officials 
said.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, the provincial party committee 
and government convened a province-wide televised teleconference 
to mobilize party committees and governments at all levels, as 
well as various departments, to effectively take the maintenance 
of social stability as a prominent and urgent task at present, 
and to ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth and 
achieve victories in economic development and social stability 
by paying keen attention to stability. 
  Governor Jia Zhijie, deputy secretary of the provincial 
party 
committee, and Vice Governor Meng Qingping made speeches. Hui 
Liangyu, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, 
stressed several questions. Vice Governor Zhang Baojiang, the 
mayor of Wuhan, attended the meeting. 
  First of all, Jia Zhijie made an analysis of our province's 
political and economic situation, saying: Like the other parts 
of the country, our province's political and economic situation 
is fine on the whole. The party Central Committee's principle 
of grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability has become the 
consensus of the people throughout the province. The several 
major reform measures adopted by the central authorities are 
being implemented smoothly. The economy is developing a cycle 
of sustained, rapid, and healthy growth. The momentum of 
agricultural production is gratifying. Summer grain and 
oil-bearing crops are doing well universally, and a bumper 
harvest is in the offing. Town and township enterprises 
continue to maintain their breakthrough development momentum. 
With a relatively good takeoff at the beginning of this year, 
industrial production maintained comparatively high growth for 
the second time since the Seventh Five-Year Plan was 
implemented. The market is brisk, with the sales of major 
commodities increasing by a wide margin. The financial 
situation is generally stable. Foreign trade exports have 
registered rapid expansion. What is commendable is that party 
committees and governments at all levels, as well as various 
departments, trades, and professions are trying to overtake each 
other in friendly emulation. They are in high spirits, full of 
drive in vying with each other in the race against time, and 
going all-out for development. Nevertheless, we also must 
notice that this year is of crucial importance to deepening 
reform and establishing a socialist market economy structure. 
Contradictions in various aspects of our endeavor are 
complicated. Some temporary difficulties in economic life are 
relatively pronounced. Some destabilizing factors in social 
life are growing in number. If they are not remedied in real 
earnest, they possibly may affect social stability. 
  Therefore, he particularly stressed the need to handle 
correctly the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability. He pointed out: Stability is the most important 
task at present. As for the relationship between stability, on 
the one hand, and reform and development, on the other, 
stability is of overriding importance. He said: The most 
pronounced issue affecting stability at present is that 
state-owned enterprises are not invigorated, the amount of 
losses suffered by loss-making enterprises is increasing, and 
the number of enterprises completely or partially suspending 
production is expanding continuously. This being the case, the 
province should mobilize itself urgently and do its utmost to 
invigorate state-owned enterprises and help them get out of 
their dilemma so as to ensure social stability. He pointed out: 
The fundamental way to invigorate state-owned enterprises is to 
deepen reform and effectively change the way they operate. In 
light of current conditions, however, we should adopt emergency 
measures in accordance with the principle of taking both stopgap 
and radical measures. First, we should solve the current most 
pronounced fund- shortage problem, raise funds through various 
channels, and regenerate those enterprises completely or 
partially suspending production. So far, the provincial 
authorities have raised one billion yuan in funds and will use 
the money to regenerate some enterprises that have completely or 
partially suspended production and to solve the "triangle debt" 
problem among enterprises. Second, we should firmly lighten the 
burdens of enterprises. Third, we should adopt supporting 
measures in policy terms. He especially pointed out: We should 
practice a policy of tilting to large and medium-sized 
state-owned cotton textile industrial enterprises. Currently, we 
should devote great efforts to organizing cotton supplies and 
help a number of selected cotton spinning enterprises overcome 
their cotton shortages. 
  He went on to stress: Party committees and governments at 
all levels must strengthen leadership over the work of 
maintaining stability, with the principal leading comrades 
taking up the job personally. On the one hand, they must solve 
the pronounced problems in social life. On the other, they 
should invigorate state-owned enterprises, lighten enterprise 
burdens, and carry out in a down-to-earth manner the various 
measures designed to maintain stability, right down to the 
grass-roots units. Efforts should be made to promote the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy and to achieve our province's overall goal of 
overfulfilling the plan, catching up with the nation, lifting 
the economy to a new level, and every trade and profession 
making a new breakthrough. 
  Vice Governor Meng Qingping made a speech specially dealing 
with the contradictions and problems currently facing 
enterprises. He emphatically pointed out: It is necessary to 
attach great importance to the problem of demanding forced 
donations from enterprises, thus placing unreasonable burdens on 
them, and to take it as an important task of implementing the 
central authorities' principles and maintaining social stability 
to curb the collection of apportionments of expenses and to 
lighten enterprise burdens. 
  In conclusion, Hui Liangyu, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee, stressed: Currently, we must 
effectively cut the number of meetings to a minimum, go down to 
the grass-roots units, keep in touch with the masses, devote 
great efforts to maintaining stability, and ensure reform and 
development with stability. He went on to stress: A solid job 
should be done in the propaganda orientation of public opinion 
and in the comprehensive management of public security.

  [Text] The provincial party school's third-phase 
rotational training in the Three Basics officially started 
yesterday morning. 
  At yesterday morning's ceremony, Pu Chaozhu, secretary of 
the 
provincial party committee and president of the provincial party 
school, delivered a speech in which he emphatically called for 
setting more store by the study of theory and for further 
enhancing party spirit. He said: These two aspects are part 
and parcel of all party building work! 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu also urged party cadres at all levels 
across the province to understand the profound importance of the 
study of theory; to study revolutionary theory in a 
conscientious manner; and to implement the party's principles 
and policies more accurately and to the letter. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu stated: At present, while studying 
Marxist- Leninist theory, we should focus on studying Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; use the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," 
volume three, as the main teaching material; study theories in 
light of actual local conditions; clearly understand and 
profoundly grasp socialism; and comprehend the necessity of 
building and developing socialism, which is a fundamental issue 
at the moment. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: We should know that socialism 
aims at liberating and developing the productive forces; 
conscientiously learn and master socialist market economic 
theory; bear in mind that the on-going economic structural 
reform aims at building and perfecting the socialist market 
economy structure; and by dint of in-depth theory study, 
heighten both our consciousness and our firmness in building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and in comprehensively 
implementing and carrying out the party's basic line. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu held: While studying revolutionary 
theory, we should persistently adhere to the fine style of 
integrating theory with practice; become more capable of 
applying theory to practice; and transform both the subjective 
and objective worlds in accordance with revolutionary theory. 
In view of the prevailing problems among leading cadres at and 
above the county level, we should employ methods developed in 
each and every rectification movement; conduct both criticisms 
and self-criticisms; concentrate on studying a list of selected 
original works by Marx, Lenin, and Deng Xiaoping; and firmly 
grasp their essence and spirit, thereby achieving mastery 
through a comprehensive study of the subject and acquiring an 
in-depth understanding of the ideological line of persistently 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. In 
addition, we should try to acquire an in-depth understanding of 
such four basic issues as communist ideals, socialist faith, 
whole- hearted service to the people, and democratic centralism, 
as well as a better understanding of Marxism, thereby 
successfully transforming our world outlook; enhancing our party 
spirit; and accelerating the pace of reform, opening up, and 
economic development in local areas and local units under the 
guidance of revolutionary theory. 
  Meng Jiyao, member of the provincial party committee 
standing 
committee and director of its organization department, also 
attended the opening ceremony, which was presided over by Zhao 
Shaomin, deputy director of the provincial party committee's 
propaganda department, executive vice president of the 
provincial party school, and secretary of its party committee.

  [Text] Kunming, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Some 40 percent of the 
provincial and prefectural officials are from ethnic minorities 
in Yunnan, a southwestern province with a large number of 
ethnic-minority inhabitants. 
  A provincial official said that of the total number of the 
province's ethnic officials 68.5 have education up to college or 
special secondary school level. More than half of them hold the 
titles as professors or technicians. 
  Yunnan is home to 25 ethnic minorities, which make up 34 
percent of its population. Most of them used to live primitive 
lives before the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. 
To improve life and education for these ethnic people, the 
province has earmarked over one million yuan (about 110,000 U.S. 
dollars) every year to help start special training classes for 
ethnic officials. 
  Now the number of technical personnel among the ethnic 
population has hit a record high of 127,000. Many of them are 
very active in various walks of life such as agriculture, 
engineering, education, science and technology. Some have 
become acclaimed professors and research scientists. 
  At present, ethnic-minority people hold such prominent 
positions in the Communist Party, government and legislature as 
deputy party head, provincial governor and deputy governor, head 
of the provincial people's congress and chairman or 
vice-chairman of provincial committees of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference.

  [Excerpts] On the morning of 28 April the provincial higher 
people's court sponsored a press briefing to disclose the 
province's achievements in launching the "spring offensive" 
against crimes, during which the responsible personnel of the 
provincial higher people's court said: Since the beginning of 
this year and particularly since the beginning of the "spring 
offensive", the people's courts at all levels throughout the 
province have regarded the work of maintaining the social 
stability and safeguarding the economic construction as their 
own missions and actively joined in the offensive. While doing 
a good job in conducting the administration of justice, they 
have particularly, emphatically, and vigorously grasped the 
trials of criminal cases and strictly punished a large number of 
criminal elements who have jeopardized the social peace. Thus, 
the achievements scored by the province in the "spring 
offensive" have been further consolidated and broadened. 
  After the launching of "spring offensive", the people's 
courts at all levels have reinforced the dynamics in dealing 
blows at criminal elements. Particularly as for serious and 
appalling cases, they have achieved in having their leading 
personnel attach importance on them; concentrate their efforts 
on handling them; join in the handling of them in advance; 
firmly grasp the trials and examination of them; and give heavy 
punishment to convicts rapidly. Last week alone, the provincial 
higher people's court held the meetings of judicial officers in 
three consecutive days to examine and handle 64 serious and 
appalling criminal cases. During the meetings the participants 
made decisions to sentence 76 convicts to the death penalty, 
eight convicts to the death penalty with a reprieve, nine 
convicts to life imprisonment, and 36 convicts to more than 
three months imprisonment. As of 23 April the provincial higher 
people's court wound up 216 cases of second trials and retrials, 
which showed an 86-case increase over the same period of 1993, 
and gave sentences to 466 convicts. [passage omitted] 
  Currently under the unified leadership and arrangement made 
by the local party committees, the people's courts at all levels 
across the province are closely coordinated with the organs of 
public security and people's procuratorate; are concentrating 
their superior forces on dealing with serious and appalling 
cases; and are striving to win an overall victory in the "spring 
offensive".

  [Text] Hohhot, May 11 (XINHUA) -- The solidarity among 
residents of different nationalities and social development in 
Inner Mongolia are epitomes of China's nationalities-inhabited 
regions, according to Ismail Amat, Chinese state councillor and 
minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission. 
  Amat accompanied Premier Li Peng on a recent visit to Inner 
Mongolia. 
  Established May 1, 1947, Inner Mongolia was China's first 
autonomous region. It has a long history of solidarity among 
nationalities. In the 1950s a large number of intellectuals and 
construction workers from other parts of China went there to 
help with the construction of the region. The late Premier Zhou 
Enlai praised the region as "a model autonomous region" in 1959. 
  With the implementation of the reform and open policy, Inner 
Mongolia reached a new stage of solidarity and economic exchange 
in a stable social environment. 
  Under the guidance of the state nationalities policy and the 
autonomous law of the minority-nationality regions, Inner 
Mongolia passed a series of regional laws to meet the needs of 
the reform and open drive. To train officials from minority 
nationalities for regional management is a key task. So far, 
there are 157,000 such officials. 
  Agriculture and animal husbandry have developed rapidly in 
Inner Mongolia in recent years. 
  In 1993 the gross product, per capita income of urban 
residents and net per capita income of peasants and herdsmen 
were up 8.12, 6.26 and 5.45 times, respectively, compared with 
the figures for 1978. Science and technology, education, 
culture and health care have likewise made great progress.

  [Text] On 29 April, State Councillor Li Guixian inspected 
Tianjin and also heard the work reports of the departments 
concerned in Tianjin. Municipal Leading Comrades Gao Dezhan, 
Zhang Lichang, Li Shenglin, Fang Fengyou, and Zhang Guanwen and 
responsible persons of the departments concerned respectively 
accompanied Li Guixian to conduct the inspections and hear the 
reports. 
  During his stay in Tianjin, Li Guixian inspected labor 
service markets, heard the reports on the situation of the 
municipal skilled personnel exchange and service center and on 
preparations for building the north China skilled personnel 
market, and visited the north China skilled personnel market 
whose construction is being prepared. Li Guixian pointed out: 
Skilled personnel markets must well be developed and 
standardized. It is necessary to build labor and skilled 
personnel exchange centers, to create fine conditions under 
which both employment units and laborers can select each other 
and the laborers can compete with one another equally, and to 
promote a reasonable distribution and flow of laborers. Skilled 
personnel markets must not only possess the basic functions for 
recommending skilled persons, acting as go-between, and 
promoting exchange but also set up an overall social service 
system where exchange, development, information distribution, 
and social guarantee are merged into an organic whole. It is 
necessary to set up a set of regulations and systems suitable to 
this system. For instance, there must be strict regulations on 
employment, dismissal, on-the-job injuries, diseases, and 
old-aged insurance. Laborer service markets and skilled 
personnel exchange markets should undoubtedly provide convenient 
conditions for both employment units and job seekers in the 
course of transition from the planned economy to the market 
economy as well as in the aspects of laborer employment and job 
selections. Trouble will be created in the future if there are 
no strict demarcation lines. 
  During staying in Tianjin, Li Guixian also heard the reports 
on reforming the wage system and the organizational system, and 
also set forth specific requirements. 
  On the morning of 30 April, accompanied by the municipal 
leading comrades, Li Guixian arrived at the Tianjin steel tube 
company by car. They heard the reports made by the company 
responsible persons on steel tube production and marketing 
situation, implementation of the shareholding system, products 
on outside-the-border markets, and the project for directly 
returning to iron. After that, Li Guixian also zestfully 
visited the steel works, rolling tube plant, and tube processing 
plant; carefully watched the steel tube production process; and 
fully affirmed the achievements made by the company in such a 
short period of time. Li Guixian and his party left Tianjin on 
3 May.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 11 (XINHUA) -- A new direct shipping 
route from this north China port city to the west coast of the 
United States means the end of cargo shipping via Hong Kong and 
the Middle East to North America. 
  An official at the container shipping headquarters of the 
China Ocean Shipping Company, which opened the new route, said 
that the rapid growth of Sino-U.S. trade and trade with other 
Far East nations have made the opening of the new route a 
necessity. 
  According to the official, ships will leave Tianjin every 
Saturday and go via Qingdao in Shandong Province, and Kobe and 
Yokohama in Japan to Seattle in the United States. Then they 
will sail north to Vancouver in Canada and return to Tianjin via 
Kobe. 
  Six ships capable of handling a total of 2,700 containers 
will ply the new route. That will push the China Ocean Shipping 
Company from tenth position to fifth position among 100 shipping 
companies in the Pacific region in terms of shipping capacity. 
  The first port with a specialized container dock in China, 
the Tianjin port now has eight berths for containers, with an 
annual handling capacity topping one million standard 
containers. The port has opened some 160 international shipping 
routes.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Guo Yuxue (6753 3768 1331): "Mobilize and </F>
Concentrate Efforts To Improve Large and Medium-Sized 
State-Owned Enterprises"] 
  [Text] An important task of the current economic work is 
how to comply with the requirement for establishing the 
socialist market economy system and step up improvement of large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises to enable them to play 
a greater role in deepening reform, developing the economy, and 
stabilizing society. With this task in mind, He Zhukang, 
secretary of the provincial party committee, conducted 
investigation and study in Jilin city from 25 to 29 April. 
  Comrade He Zhukang heard an overall work report by a leading 
comrade of the Jilin city party committee and held discussions 
with the responsible persons of 30 large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises of different types at three forums, 
including the Jilin Chemical Fiber Limited Company, Jilin 
Ferroalloy Plant, Songyuan Food Industrial Company, and Jilin 
city company of chemicals for daily use. Directors (managers) 
and party secretaries of these enterprises talked freely about 
their methods and experiences to transform mechanisms, improve 
management, enhance skills, increase benefits, and strengthen 
party building in the new situation of establishing the 
socialist market economy system and, based on their specific 
conditions, offered views and suggestions on how to overcome the 
current difficulties by deepening reform and how to enable 
enterprises to extract themselves from the predicament, enhance 
their vigor, and improve economic benefits. Comrade He Zhukang 
also conducted field investigation at the Jilin Chemical Fiber 
Limited Company, Jinuoer Electric Appliance (Group) Company, 
Jilin Woolen Mill, and two other plants. 
  Comrade He Zhukang spoke highly of the great amount of 
fruitful work carried out by the Jilin city party committee and 
government since the beginning of this year to develop the 
economy, safeguard social stability, strengthen party building, 
and, in particular, improve large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises. He fully affirmed the methods and experiences of 
some enterprises, which had deepened reform continuously, 
stepped up technical transformation, served the needs of the 
domestic and world markets, and improved economic benefits 
despite the many difficulties they encountered. He pointed out: 
Large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises constitute the 
core of the socialist public sector of the economy, the pillar 
and backbone of the national economy, and the major source of 
state revenue. How they are developed is not only an important 
economic issue but also an important political and social issue 
because it concerns the overall situation of reform, 
development, and stability and the socialist orientation of 
taking public ownership as the foundation. Whether large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises can be improved represents 
a severe test for our party and government. Party committees 
and governments at all levels must take this issue seriously 
from this perspective. Judging from the conditions of Jilin city 
and the entire province, they have adopted some effective 
measures since early this year when the provincial party 
committee held a work conference on improvement of large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises; some enterprises have 
begun to invigorate; others are still very difficult, but their 
bright prospects have shown; and enterprises which can find no 
way out are very few. This shows that not only should we 
improve as demanded by the situation, but also we have the 
methods to improve. We need to further unify our thinking, be 
determined, mobilize and concentrate efforts to perform work in 
line with the requirements of the three-year plan of the 
provincial party committee and government for improving large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, and improve these 
enterprises group after group at different times. Not only 
should leaders at all levels attach great importance to this 
issue, but also all trades and professions and all fields should 
achieve a common understanding, regard improvement of large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises as the most important and 
urgent task for the present, and muster some financial resources 
and create favorable conditions to invigorate them first even if 
this means that some fields have to tighten up their financial 
resources for some time. When large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises are not improved, other fields of work 
cannot be promoted. For this reason, all fields should provide 
necessary conditions and support to improve large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises. 
  Comrade He Zhukang said: The entire industrial sector of 
the economy, especially large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises, is in a very crucial period for development and in 
a very important period for change. First, it has become an 
irresistible development trend to change the planned economy to 
the market economy, and the operating mechanism for the market 
economy has begun to enter enterprises and property right 
relations and is being gradually standardized. Second, the 
consumption pattern in people's life has effected a significant 
change because they have stepped from merely having sufficient 
food and clothes to a moderately prosperous life. This requires 
adjustment of the entire economic structure, especially the 
structure of the industrial economy. Third, new worldwide 
technological revolution and the rapid development of modern 
science and technology have brought about increasingly intense 
competition in the world economy. To gain a foothold in the 
competition, Jilin should also accelerate its economic 
restructuring. Meanwhile, the change in the economic system and 
the structural adjustment call for the compliance of all the 
spheres of the superstructure and the improvement of people's 
quality. Such a change represents a challenge and also a new 
opportunity. We should have a full understanding of this, study 
and arrange it early, acquire a better and comprehensive 
understanding of this important change and crucial period for 
development, guide action according to circumstances, and 
correctly make decisions. This is an important responsibility of 
leading cadres and also a test for them. We should fully 
understand the urgency of this issue, greatly mobilize our 
efforts, and plunge ourselves heart and soul into reform and 
development. We should be aware of the crisis like a boat 
sailing against the current which must forge ahead or will be 
driven back, display the indomitable spirit, have the ability to 
learn and the courage to explore in the practice of reform and 
development, conquer difficulties, and enhance ability. 
  Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: In the period for the 
historical change and in the new situation, our understanding 
often falls behind practice due to our lack of mental 
preparations, and our concepts, work ideas, and work methods are 
very incompatible. As far as the endeavor to improve large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises is concerned, we still need 
to further unify thinking and enhance the understanding of some 
issues so as to pool more efforts and achieve greater results. 
  First, in the overall economic pattern of establishing the 
socialist market economy system, large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises will and should continue to play a key 
role and improve themselves without wavering. They have no 
other choice. 
  Second, we should enhance confidence. Despite the many 
difficulties, we also have many favorable conditions and great 
potential for improving large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises. The key is to enhance confidence and be firm to 
carry out work through to the end. 
  Third, when improving large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises, we should have new concepts and new ideas instead 
of the old methods adopted during the period for the planned 
economy. Improving large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises requires support and necessary assistance from the 
government. Relevant government departments should actively 
help enterprises unload the heavy historical burden. 
Enterprises, however, should understand that in the condition 
of the market economy, they should rely on their own efforts and 
should march toward the market to invigorate themselves. 
Therefore, we should further lift control over enterprises and 
grant them all the decision-making power they are entitled to as 
stipulated in the "enterprise law," so that they will truly have 
the courage to adopt various effective measures to develop 
themselves. Meanwhile, state-owned enterprises should also 
further emancipate the mind, broaden their field of thinking, 
allow the adoption of different ownerships at state-owned 
enterprises, and have the ability to bring in funds from abroad 
to conduct technical transformation. Regarding this work, we 
should have the courage to seek truth from facts and be willing 
to allow others to gain benefits. Only when these enterprises 
are invigorated can they achieve development. 
  Fourth, we should not only adopt various measures, 
strengthen 
management, and accelerate technical transformation and 
development of new products to improve large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises. But we should also pay close attention 
to the central link of reform of the property right system. We 
should adopt every means to make the best use of the assets 
available by selling or leasing them out, reorganizing them, or 
transplanting them to others. We should raise funds for 
technical transformation and construction through various 
channels. When buying new assets, we should make accurate 
selection to ensure that they create good benefits, enjoy a good 
market, and have bright prospects. 
  Fifth, we should take both current and long-term work into 
consideration, first make current work successful, and, in the 
meantime, study the strategy for long-term development. We 
should adopt every means possible to guarantee the production of 
the enterprises whose products are of good quality and sell well 
in the market and muster efforts to support them. We should 
strengthen marketing, reduce stockpiles, and adopt various 
effective means to reduce deficits and increase profits and 
revenues. 
  Sixth, establishing the social security system is a task 
that 
brooks no delay. We should actively probe into it with new 
ideas. 
  Seventh, we should trust and rely on the masses. Staff 
members and workers are the major participators in reform and 
development. We should mobilize them to discuss the major 
affairs of enterprises and fully stimulate the enthusiasm of all 
fields. We should combine material incentives with spiritual 
encouragement and strict demands with concern and love, give 
full play to the role of advanced examples as models and leaders 
and the role of trade unions, Communist Youth League, women's 
federations, and other mass organizations as bridges and 
channels, and lead people's enthusiasm to reform and 
development. We should show concern for and cherish those with 
outstanding achievements in improving large and medium- sized 
state-owned enterprises, improve their material benefits, and 
commend them so that more such people will emerge. 
  Comrade He Zhukang urged: In the process of improving large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, we should strengthen 
and improve party leadership. Party committees at all levels 
should take the overall situation in view to correctly handle 
the relations between reform, development, and stability, have 
the ability to observe and think over issues from a political 
view, continuously enhance the sense of respect for party 
leadership and the overall situation, coordinate well the 
relations between various sectors, and conscientiously implement 
the work principles of the party Central Committee and the work 
arrangements of the provincial party committee. A very 
important point in strengthening party leadership is to further 
implement the principle of democratic centralism. All important 
issues should be decided after collective discussions of party 
committees, and their implementation should be organized 
according to the division of work. We should place reform, 
development, and stability at the center of party committee's 
work. We should carry out the various reform measures in line 
with Jilin's actual conditions; often restructure the economy 
with new ideas and methods, improve the quality of enterprises, 
and maintain sustained, stable, and healthy economic 
development; and adhere to the principle of attaching equal 
importance to the two tasks and never wavering in either, 
strengthen ideological and political work, achieve success in 
punishing corruption, advocating honesty, and maintaining public 
order, and safeguard social stability. Leaders at all levels 
should improve work styles, intensify investigation and study, 
maintain close ties with the masses, guard against exaggeration, 
and oppose formalism. In view of the new situation, cadres at 
all levels should intensify the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 
knowledge on the socialist market economy, the knowledge on 
modern science and technology, and the knowledge on laws. They 
should step up correct and comprehensive analysis of the 
situation and think over some major issues on theories and 
practice in line with reality to gain more foresight and 
initiative in work. 
  When in Jilin city, Comrade He Zhukang also held a 
discussion 
on agriculture and rural work with the responsible comrades of 
relevant departments of the city party committee and government 
and inspected the development of the tertiary industry in the 
Tiannan Township of Jiaohe city. 
  Participating in the investigation and study activities were 
Vice Governor Wei Minxue and responsible comrades of the general 
office, organization departments, and research office of the 
provincial party committee, the provincial commission for 
restructuring of the economy, provincial economic and trade 
commission, provincial finance department, Jilin Provincial 
bureau of the State Taxation Administration, provincial labor 
department, provincial industrial and commercial bank, and 
provincial trade union council.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Desheng (1327 1795 3932): "Gu Jinchi </F>
Inspects Shenyang"] 
  [Excerpts] On 30 April, accompanied by Zhao Jincheng and 
Zhang Ruichang, leaders of Shenyang city; and responsible 
comrades of the province and Shenyang city, Gu Jinchi, Wang 
Huaiyuan, Zhang Guoguang, Xu Wencai, Liu Zhenhua, and Cong 
Zhenglong, leaders of the provincial party committee and 
government, conducted one-day investigation and study activities 
in Shenyang and also cordially extended festive greetings to the 
staff and workers, security cadres and policemen, and armed 
police commanders and fighters who were working on the holiday. 
[passage omitted] 
  In regard to the problems of alleviating the strain on 
capital, Gu Jinchi said: Shortage of capital is a general 
problem. But, there are two different kinds of attitudes toward 
this problem. Should we positively think of methods and measures 
and depend on own efforts or simply rely on higher levels and 
wait for higher levels' support? Different attitudes bring 
about different results. Some of the economically developed 
areas in the province are confronted with this problem, too. 
But, with a positive attitude, these areas regard the shortage 
of capital as a kind of opportunity, try every possible means to 
collect funds, and capture the precious time for development. 
So long as we are inspired with enthusiasm and rely on our own 
efforts will we be able to overcome the temporary difficulties 
in lacking capital. 
  Gu Jinchi stressed: Each and every province and each and 
every area should have its own image, so does a trade. The 
light industrial trade is one closely related to the people's 
livelihood. So, we should be inspired with enthusiasm, 
strengthen management, accelerate the pace of technological 
transformation, and foster new image of our own. Only by so 
doing will we be able to make contributions to doing the second 
pioneering work. Leading comrades, including Gu Jinchi, also 
asked, in detail, about the living situation of the staff and 
workers of light industrial enterprises and urged these 
enterprises to try every possible means to well arrange and 
stabilize the livelihood of the staff and workers. 
  After that, Gu Jinchi and his party also went to the Beihang 
country fair trade market in Huanggu District by car to inspect 
the supply situation of the market on the holiday. [passage 
omitted] 
  Gu Jinchi said: Viewing the general situation, we know that 
the market supply situation is good. But, we must pay high 
attention to the problems relating to excessively fast price 
hikes. We should proceed from safeguarding the interests of the 
people, approach from the high plane of stabilizing the overall 
situation, and do our best to control the goods prices within 
the levels which can be accepted by the masses. The goods 
prices must not rigidly be controlled. The key to controlling 
goods prices hinges on mobilizing the enthusiasm of producers 
and managers, increasing production, expanding goods resources, 
increasing wholesale and retail sale channels, and guaranteeing 
the masses' "vegetable baskets" and "rice bags." Gu Jinchi 
urged that the provincial and city commercial, foodstuffs, and 
pricing departments should be good advisers to the provincial 
and city party committees and governments in this regard, 
provide increasingly more accurate information for higher 
levels, and made more constructive opinions and suggestions for 
higher levels. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Dongmei (3769 0392 2734): "Gu Jinchi, </F>
secretary of the Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee, Conducts 
Investigation and Study Activities in Rural Areas of Tieling 
City"] 
  [Excerpts] From 26 to 27 April, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, conducted investigation and study 
activities in the rural areas of Tieling city. After hearing 
Changtu County's report on spring sowing and economic work, he 
said that intensifying agriculture, being the foundation for 
maintaining economic development and social stability, must not 
be ignored in every minute. As a large agricultural county, 
Changtu should always put grain production in the primary 
position. Only when grain production is well developed will 
forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupation, and fishery be 
developed. To ensure an increase in grain production, we should 
mainly maintain grain sowing areas, increase per unit area 
yield, and achieve scientific farming. [passage omitted] 
  After talking about the facts that Changtu is a large 
agricultural county but a small industrial county and that some 
county-run industrial enterprises in the county are confronted 
with difficulties, Gu Jinchi said: At the time of persistently 
taking agriculture as the foundation, we must exert great 
efforts to grasp industrial production and strive to enliven 
state-owned enterprises. First, we should enable enterprise 
leaders, staff members, and workers as well as responsible 
departments to realistically strengthen the idea of markets. 
This is a decisive factor for enterprises' development. It is 
necessary to achieve the readjustment of the product mix and the 
industrial structure according to market demands. Second, we 
should have the idea of high efficiency. To develop industries, 
we must stress efficiency. Each and every enterprise should have 
profit and tax targets, strive to reduce production costs and 
consumption, and try every possible means to increase the tax 
rate levels. Third, we should select good cadres, select the 
persons with managerial ability to run enterprises, link 
responsibility with right and power, and have outstanding 
skilled persons show their abilities and talents. [passage 
omitted] Fourth, we should mobilize office cadres to go deep to 
the grass roots, organize several inspection groups to help 
enterprises solve their practical problems, attend to weak 
links, and consolidate enterprises. 
  Gu Jinchi said: We should persist in the principle of taking 
a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough in 
developing both agriculture and industry. It is necessary to 
achieve both spiritual civilization and party building, 
particularly the construction of leading bodies and leading 
organs. The leading cadres at various levels and the personnel 
of the leading organs should strictly be self-disciplined and do 
their work in a cautious and conscientious manner. After 
hearing the situation that the Changtu County grain bureau 
simplifies the administrative structure, Gu Jinchi said: This 
bureau has provided the organs across the province with 
experiences in simplifying the administrative structure. At 
present, some persons of some organs are busy day and night, 
some drift along aimlessly, and some act as commentators and 
indulge themselves in grumbling. Some units originally have to 
serve the consumers. By changing this kind of service into 
privilege, they always apportion expenses from those who ask 
them to handle affairs. All this is related to overstaffed 
organizations and bureaucracy. So, the administrative structure 
should resolutely be simplified even if there are great 
difficulties. The organs at various levels should maintain 
administrative honesty and high efficiency, deal with concrete 
work, and better serve the people. Tang Tiehan, secretary of the 
Tieling city party committee; and Li Shiwen, mayor of the city, 
accompanied Gu Jinchi to call on the family members of Bo 
Renshi, a model town and township cadre and late secretary of 
the party committee of Baoli Town of Changtu County.

  [Text] Shenyang, May 6 (XINHUA) -- More and more people in 
Shenyang city, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province, 
are eager to have telephones installed in their homes. 
  Every day more than 400 people come to the Bureau of 
Telecommunications to apply for installation of phones. 
  An official of the bureau noted that the number of 
applicants 
peaked at 1,900 one day. 
  Experts attributed this tendency to the increase in people's 
income in the past decade. 
  On average, the cost for a telephone line for a private home 
is about 5,000 yuan. 
  Ten years ago, people would naturally regard the person with 
a home telephone as a leader or a celebrity. But now things are 
quite different, and telephones have entered common people's 
homes. 
  From the mid-1980s on, Shenyang has invested a lot of money 
to introduce automatic telephone exchanges, program-controlled 
telex switching equipment, mobile telephone systems and radio 
tracking systems from Belgium, Sweden, and Taiwan. 
  The telecommunications network in Shenyang became 
program-controlled last year, and its capacity has been expanded 
to 420,000 lines. 
  From the beginning of the 1990s, applicants for telephone 
installations in Shenyang have multiplied year after year. 
  In 1993, those who applied for prIvate telephones aCcounted 
for 80 percent of the total applicants. 
  From 1990 to 1993, the number of telephones installed each 
year was 13,000, 20,000, 40,000 and 100,000. 
  But the rate of installation is still far lower than that of 
the increasing number of applicants for private telephones. 
  Now there is a telephone for every ten people in Shenyang, 
said the official. 
  Private telephones have become popular because of the 
convenience they bring. On the first day of the spring 
festival, more than 600 people extended greetings to relatives 
abroad by telephone from their homes. 
  This year, Shenyang will enlarge its telephone capacity by 
an 
added 377,000 lines and install 150,000 telephones for citizens. 
  The city will also construct and reconstruct 10 urban 
telephone service bureaus. 
  By 1995, the total telephone lines in the city will reach 
1.15 million or a telephone for every five people.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing met here this afternoon with visiting Director-General 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Peter 
Sutherland. 
  They exchanged opinions on China's re-entry into GATT and 
some other issues of common concern. 
  Li said that eight years have passed since China applied for 
re-entry into GATT, and now, although the Uruguay Round has 
ended, the re-entry issue remains unsettled. 
  He said that China was a full participant in the Uruguay 
Round and China advocates a balance between rights and 
obligations on GATT issues. 
  Li noted that China, as an open country now, has to practice 
trade in accordance with international rules, adding that China 
is making efforts to re-enter GATT and become a founding member 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is due to be set up 
next year, in order to meet the demands of China's economic 
development and many other countries' requirements. 
  On market access, Li said this is a gradual procedure and 
China will lower its tariffs step by step, pointing out that 
along with the development of China's economy, China will 
realize its commitment through its own efforts. 
  Touching upon the national treatment issue, Li said that the 
unification of China's dual-track exchange rates is the most 
profitable treatment for overseas business people. 
  He continued that the opening of China's service sector, 
from 
hotel management over 10 years ago to shops, banks and 
insurance, has expanded during the past few years. 
  To assure healthy development of China's service sector, Li 
noted that the opening of this sector should go forward step by 
step, for China lacks experience and qualified personnel in this 
field, adding that such an opening will be profitable for both 
the Chinese and the foreign sides. 
  Li said that the future WTO should treat China as a 
developing country, and China should never accept the standards 
for developed countries. 
  Before the meeting, China's Minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation Wu Yi also met with Sutherland. 
  Wu said that China needs the assurance of a multi-lateral 
trade system and the world trade system also needs China as a 
participant. 
  She added that, without the participation of China, WTO 
would 
be incomplete and would lack universality. 
  Sutherland said that China should become a full participant 
in WTO so as to provide it with both assurance and 
opportunities, and he expressed hope that both negotiating sides 
would show some flexibility to achieve the anticipated results 
at an early date.

Fahim Bin-Sultan al-Qasimi [spelling of name as received] and 
his party here this morning, Qian said that China attaches much 
importance to its friendship and cooperation with the Council 
for the Arab States of the Gulf and its member nations. The two 
sides are highly complementary in their economies and their 
co-operation enjoys broad prospects, he added. 
  Qian said that China appreciates the efforts that the 
council

said that the parties concerned should find a final solution to 
the Gulf issues through consultation and dialogue on the basis 
of the relevant resolution of the UN Security Council. 
  Qian told the council's secretary-general that China is 
watching closely the developments in Yemen. He urged the two 
sides to act in a cool and restrained manner, stop fighting 
immediately and resolve their disputes through peaceful means 
and restore peace and stability in the country. 
  Al-Qasimi said that the Gulf countries and China have long 
had friendly co-operative relations. He added that they share 
the same or similar views on many regional and international

the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan held talks here today 
with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt on joint efforts to 
promote bilateral relations. 
  Li Ruihuan said that China and Sweden are far away from each 
other, and have no conflict of basic interests. 
  He said that there is great potential for economic 
cooperation because the economies of the two countries are 
mutually complementary. 
  Li said China is carrying out large scale economic 
development and Swedish advanced technology and management 
experience could be very useful. 
  Bildt spoke highly of China's great achievements in economic 
reform, saying that it is important not only for China but also 
for Eastern Asia and the world economy. 
  The Swedish prime minister said that bilateral relations 
between China and Sweden have developed rapidly in recent years. 
  He also expressed Swedish support for China's reentry into 
the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT). 
  Sweden is the second stop on Li's five-European-nation tour 
which has already taken him to Finland and includes Norway, 
Denmark and Belgium.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "China's Nuclear System Meets World </F>
Standards"] 
  [Text] China's nuclear regulatory system meets 
international standards, a review team announced on Monday after 
a two-week inspection. 
  The study was the first conducted on China's nuclear plants 
by an international group. 
  It inspected units and offered suggestions including 
improving backup systems and expanding the role of the China 
National Safety Administration (NNSA), the nuclear industry's 
independent regulatory body. 
  NNSA, which invited the team from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), was set up in 1984 to oversee the 
structure, organization, regulations, safety review, licensing 
and commissioning of nuclear plants . 
  The international team said the NNSA provides a good model 
for countries developing nuclear programmes. 
  "The licensing and review process employed at the Daya Bay 
and Qinshan units conforms with international practice," said 
Morris Rosen, IAEA's assistant director general. 
  Huang Qitao, director general of NNSA, said the group's 
visit 
demonstrates the importance the government is giving to nuclear 
safety. 
  He said the evaluation also helped China locate shortcomings 
in its programme and gain advice from overseas experts. 
  "This will help ensure the safe operation of nuclear 
installations in China and protect the public and the 
environment," Huang said. 
  The review commission said the NNSA should pay more 
attention 
to operational experience feedback systems in accident 
prevention. 
  Such systems, common worldwide, can identify problems ahead 
of time, thus allowing preventive measures to be taken. 
  The group also said the NNSA should take a more active role 
in nuclear industry decisions and provide advice to provincial 
governments and the National Nuclear Accident Emergency 
Committee. 
  Two nuclear plants have gone into operation the past two 
years: one at Daya Bay in Shenzhen and another in Qinshan, 
Zhejiang Province. 
  Two more 600,000 kilowatt units have been authorized for 
Qinshan and additional units are also planned for Daya Bay. 
  The areas reviewed included nuclear safety legislation, the 
role and responsibility of the regulatory body, regulations and 
guides, the licensing process, applicant requirements, 
inspection and enforcement, and emergency preparations.

<F P=106> ["Report (Excerpts) on the Implementation of Anhui </F>
Province's 1993 Budget and the Draft of Its 1994 Budget" -- 
delivered by Kuang Bingwen, director of the Anhui Provincial 
Finance Department at the Second Session of the Eighth Anhui 
Provincial People's Congress on 6 April 1994] 
  [Text] Entrusted by the Anhui Provincial People's 
Government, I now submit a report on the implementation of 
Anhui's 1993 budget and the draft of its 1994 budget to the 
session. Please examine it. 
<H5>  I. Implementation of the 1993 Budget </H5>
  In 1993, while Anhui enjoyed sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development, total provincial revenues overfulfilled 
budgeted amounts and total provincial expenditures basically 
guaranteed normal requirements and supported economic and social 
development. Anhui improved the balance between its financial 
revenues and expenditures. 
<H5>  (1) Anhui Province's Implementation of Its Budget </H5>
  Of the 1993 budget approved by the First Session of the 
Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress for Anhui Province, 
revenues reached 6.63038 million yuan and expenditures 5.89159 
million yuan. After adding funds carried over from the previous 
year and special additional funds appropriated from the central 
treasury, the budgeted expenditures must be adjusted to 8.27229 
million yuan. 
  The implementation of the 1993 budget for Anhui is as 
follows: 
  Revenues amounted to 7.3209 million yuan, or 110.4 percent 
of 
the budgeted amount. The figure exceeded the budgeted amount by 
690.54 million yuan and posted a 32.8-percent increase over 
1992. Calculated in accordance with the current financial 
system, total funds available for use amounted to 6,337.24 
million yuan. Expenditures amounted to 7.20085 million yuan, or 
87 percent of the budgeted amount after adjustment. When funds 
available for use were set against expenditures, there was an 
accumulated deficit of 863.61 million yuan, less than the 
previous year by 185.93 million yuan. Anhui succeeded in 
maintaining a balance between revenues and expenditures in 1993. 
<H5>  (2) Implementation of the Provincial-Level Budget </H5>
  Of the provincial-level budget approved by the First Session 
of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress, revenues 
reached 126.23 million yuan and expenditures 1.2856 million 
yuan. After adding funds carried over from the previous year 
and special funds appropriated from the central treasury and 
after deducting funds appropriated by the province for 
prefectures and cities, the total budgeted expenditures must be 
adjusted to 2.8691 million yuan. 
  The implementation of the provincial-level budget is as 
follows: 
  Revenues returned to the treasury was 217.18 million yuan, 
more than the approved budget by 343.41 million yuan [as 
published]. Calculated in accordance with the current financial 
system, total funds available for use amounted to 1.6985 million 
yuan. Expenditures amounted to 1.6678 million yuan. When funds 
available for use were set against expenditures, there was some 
surplus. 
  Generally speaking, the 1993 budget for Anhui was 
successfully implemented. Anhui's financial revenues exceeded 
the two levels -- 6 billion and 7 billion yuan; and its 
expenditures were effectively brought under control. Anhui's 
revenues covered the year's expenditures. A number of 
prefectures and cities also eliminated some deficits posted in 
previous years and somewhat improved the situation of their 
revenues and expenditures. 
  Last year, closely revolving their efforts around the 
objectives of making financial revenues reach 7 billion yuan and 
enabling revenues to cover the year's expenditures proposed by 
the provincial party committee and government, financial and 
taxation departments in the province did a large amount of 
painstaking and fruitful work under the leadership of party 
committees and governments at all levels. 
  (1) Continuing to expand sources of revenues and increasing 
revenues of counties and townships to a new level. Having 
continued to support the 16 key counties (cities) selected in 
1992, Anhui gave support to 19 additional counties (cities) last 
year. With efforts by various levels of authorities, the 
revenue of the 35 key counties (cities) enjoying government 
support is 17.3 percent more than the target set in contracts of 
support for 1993, an increase higher than that of ordinary 
county revenue. The number of counties (cities) with revenue 
over 50 million yuan increased from 13 in 1992 to 23; among 
them, Chaohu and Suzhou cities have joined Fuyang and Bozhou 
cities to become cities with over 100 million in revenue. In 
the meantime, 36 townships and towns have increased their 
revenues. 
  (2) Strictly enforcing tax laws, strengthening the 
collection 
and management of revenues, and striving to achieve and 
overfulfill the revenue target. Last year, all localities 
vigorously took effective measures to rectify financial and 
taxation order, strengthen budgetary management, and 
conscientiously screen and check unauthorized tax reduction and 
exemption and violations of tax laws. To some extent, this has 
redressed the practices of contracting turnover taxes and 
leaving some revenues unregistered. Meanwhile, great efforts 
were made to clear tax and interest defaults. The incomes of 
prefectures and cities as a whole increased above the target set 
in the budget in 1993. 
  (3) Strictly controlling general expenditures, strengthening 
capital management, and ensuring the needs of key projects. 
Last year, all localities significantly enhanced their 
consciousness of the balance of financial revenue and 
expenditure and actively cut down and controlled general 
expenditures, mainly meeting-related spending, telephone 
charges, auto fuel charges, public health service spending, and 
others. Meanwhile, they collected funds through all possible 
means to ensure the expenditures for key projects and 
particularly did a great deal of work in ensuring wages, 
striving for more funds for agriculture and educational 
investment, and others. This has greatly supported agricultural 
production as well as the development of education and 
scientific and technological undertakings. 
  (4) Intensifying the work of financial and taxation 
supervision and management. Anhui has conducted a general 
financial and taxation inspection, a general inspection of the 
implementation of discipline for purchasing control, and a 
series of inspections of the use of special funds; further 
strengthened the management of capital not included in the 
budget; appraised properties of some selected administrative 
institutions; and launched the work of appraising assets. 
<H5>  II. Draft Fiscal Budget for 1994 </H5>
  The guiding ideology for the budgetary arrangements for 1994 
is: vigorously promote the reform of the financial and taxation 
system, rationalize distribution relations, and strive to ensure 
the smooth implementation of all measures for the reform of the 
economic system; actively create sources of revenue and 
strengthen tax collection and management according to laws to 
ensure a greater increase in revenue; firmly cut down general 
expenditures; give priority to the consideration of wages for 
staff and workers and indispensable expenses for case 
investigation and normal operations of organs, and continue to 
attach importance to the investment in agriculture, science and 
technology, education, and others; and make efforts to achieve a 
balance of financial revenue and expenditure to bring about 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development as well as 
social stability in Anhui. 
<H5>  (1) Draft Provincial Budget </H5>
  The 1994 draft budget submitted to the session for 
examination and deliberation is compiled by the provincial 
authorities. The total provincial revenue is targeted at 8.538 
billion yuan, a 16.6- percent increase over the figure 
registered in 1993 and up 9.2 percent in terms of comparable 
constants [ke bi kou jing 0668 4024 0656 1777]; this includes 
3.886 billion yuan in local revenue. Estimating and calculating 
on the basis of the revenue-sharing system, Anhui's available 
funds as well as its expenditures for the year are both budgeted 
at 7.006 billion yuan, striking a balance of revenue and 
expenditure for the year's budget. 
  1. Draft Current Budget 
  The revenue is set at 3.3025 million yuan, up 13.8 percent 
in 
terms of comparable constants; adding the revenue subsidized by 
the central authorities and deducting the sum to be turned over 
to the central authorities, the current available funds for the 
year are 6.442 billion yuan. With the current expenditures for 
the year set at 5.8009 million yuan, the balance of current 
account is 641.01 million yuan in the budget. 
  2. Draft Construction Budget 
  The revenue is set at 583.5 million yuan; adding the balance 
of current revenue for the year and others, the available 
construction funds for the year is 1.20501 million yuan. This 
strikes a balance of revenue and expenditure, with the same 
year's construction spending set at 1.20501 million yuan. 
  (2) Draft Provincial-Level Budget 
  Revenues in the provincial-level budget total 14.9 million 
yuan. As the financial system governing the provincial 
authorities' policies toward their subordinate organs has not 
been finalized yet, the available funds in the provincial budget 
for the year can only be roughly estimated at 1.4655 million 
yuan; a balance of revenue and expenditure is achieved in the 
budget, with expenditures of the year set at 1.4655 million yuan. 
  In addition to ensuring normal expenses, this year's draft 
provincial and provincial-level budgets have emphatically 
increased the investments in agriculture, education, science and 
technology, and other areas. The operating expenses for 
agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy as well as outlays 
for supporting rural production and expanses for educational and 
scientific and technological undertakings in the provincial and 
provincial-level budgets are all set higher than the revenue 
increase in the current budget. The proportion of three 
scientific and technological expenses to total expenditure in 
the budget exceeds 1 percent. The budget for the aforementioned 
expenses has met the requirements of the central as well as the 
provincial regulations. 
<H5>  III. Strive To Accomplish the Tasks in the 1994 Fiscal </H5>
Budget 
  Comprehensively achieving the tasks in this year's fiscal 
budget is an important guarantee to bring about sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development and social stability and 
unity in Anhui. Financial and taxation departments at various 
levels around the province should, under party committee and 
government guidance, actively promote financial and taxation 
reform, strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, 
vigorously increase revenues and control expenditures, strictly 
enforce financial and economic laws and discipline, and strive 
to promote Anhui's financial work to a new level. 
  (1) Concentrate efforts on carrying out financial and 
taxation reform. Leading comrades in all localities and 
departments must earnestly enhance the leadership and 
coordination in financial and taxation reform, conscientiously 
organize the implementation of reform, promote it steadily, and 
make sure it will be successful. Presently, they should properly 
deal with two tasks: 1. accelerating the organization and 
establishment of local taxation organs, strengthening the 
collection and management of local revenues, and ensuring the 
normal operation of the new financial and taxation mechanism; 
and 2. studying and drafting a program for reforming financial 
system governing the provincial authorities' policies toward 
prefectures and cities as soon as possible. Meanwhile, attention 
should be paid to intensifying investigations and studies as 
well as summing up new experiences, discovering new situations, 
and resolving new problems in time; problems concerning the 
link-up of policies while shifting from one system to another 
should be particularly handled properly to ensure the 
implementation of various reform measures. 
  (2) Continue to attach importance to expanding sources of 
revenues to enhance the momentum for financial development. It 
is necessary to actively readjust our way of thinking for 
creating sources of local revenues based on the changes in the 
distribution structure of financial resources after the 
revenue-sharing system is instituted, to create and expand 
sources of local revenues. We should continue to make the 
expansion of sources of county-level revenues our work focus, 
collect funds from various quarters, and support one more group 
of counties (cities) with promising conditions. 
  (3) Strengthen revenue collection and management and make 
sure to increase revenue to a new level. No matter whether it's 
central revenue or local revenue, every penny must be collected. 
From this year on, state enterprises must pay income taxes to 
the state strictly according to applicable tax rates. The 
practice of leaving some revenues unregistered under the system 
of "distribution of total revenue" must be redressed and all 
receivable revenues must be collected and recorded in the 
budget. Agricultural and special agricultural products taxes 
account for a significant portion of the fixed income of 
localities, all localities must intensify the construction of 
the collection and management system in view of problems such as 
scattered sources of tax revenue and great difficulties in 
collection and management to improve collection and management. 
  (4) Rationally arrange for and strictly control expenditure 
to strive for a balance between this year's revenue and 
expenditure. In arranging for this year's fiscal expenditure, 
we should first emphatically guarantee finances for personnel 
wages, essential case-handling expenditures, and government 
offices' normal operating expenses. We must try hard to ensure 
prompt and full payment of wages for personnel in administrative 
undertakings and units -- teachers in particular -- and to avoid 
back pay. Under this precondition, we will try hard to increase 
investment in agriculture, education, and science and 
technology. It is necessary to resolutely cut expenses on 
meetings, maintenance, post and telecommunications, and others 
and vigorously promote the fine tradition of diligence and 
frugality. Efforts should be made to accelerate reform of the 
expenditure control system; comprehensively implement zero-based 
budgeting; and, in conjunction with institutional reform, 
earnestly appraise and decide the establishment of 
administrative undertakings and units, fix the number of 
personnel according to the establishment, and check and ratify 
payroll against the number of personnel. 
  (5) Take effective measures to support economic development. 
First, we will continue to increase investment in agriculture 
and, with an aim to raise peasants' income, develop the rural 
economy. Second, we will support state-owned enterprises in 
terms of policy and finances to upgrade their reserve strength 
of development. Third, we will vigorously support the 
development of the tertiary industry to foster new finances. 
  (6) Strengthen state property management and deepen reform 
of 
the property rights system. We should center on changing 
state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms, establishing a 
modern enterprise system, implementing a supervisory system for 
state property, and other central tasks to actively explore a 
system and methods of state property management suited to the 
socialist market economic system. It is necessary to take 
realistic and effective measures to prevent and rectify acts 
that are detrimental to state property rights, firmly end the 
drain of state property, and ensure conservation and 
appreciation of the value of state property. 
  (7) Administer finances and taxation in accordance with the 
law and enforce financial and economic discipline. Various 
departments at all levels should earnestly study and implement 
in depth fiscal and taxation laws and regulations, persist in 
administering taxation and finances in accordance with the law, 
and manage to ensure strict observance and enforcement of the 
law as well as punishment of all law violations to truly carry 
out fiscal and taxation work within the scope of law. Fiscal 
and taxation departments at all levels in particular should 
fulfill their duties, exercise strict self-discipline, fight 
corruption, and promote clean administration to ensure that 
fiscal and taxation work is carried out properly.

  [Text] Chongqing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Sichuan Province is accelerating the construction of its 
Chengdu-Chongqing expressway. 
  The present highway from Chengdu city, capital of Sichuan 
Province, to Chongqing city, a major industrial center in the 
region, was constructed in the 1930s and the average speed of 
automobiles on the 430-kilometer highway is only about 25 
kilometers per hour. 
  In 1987, the Chinese Government decided to construct the 
expressway and listed the project as one of the key projects of 
the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period. 
  The total investment in the project amounts to 3.9 billion 
yuan. 
  The project was started in October 1989 and received World 
Bank loans of 120 million U.S. dollars. 
  The expressway is 340 kilometers in length, 98 kilometers 
shorter than the old highway and 165 kilometers shorter than the 
Chengdu- Chongqing Railway. 
  When the expressway opens to traffic, it will take three to 
four hours to drive from Chongqing to Chengdu. 
  The expressway has 261 bridges and many tunnels. The 
Zhongliangshan Tunnel, which is 6,268 meters in length, has been 
completely cut through. 
  The project is expected to be completed in July 1995.

<F P=106> [Yunnan provincial government work report delivered by </F>
Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang before the Second Session of the 
Eighth Yunnan Provincial People's Congress on 1 March: 
"Government Work Report"] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: 
  On behalf of the provincial people's government, I now 
submit 
the government work report for your examination and approval and 
also for suggestions and comments from members of the provincial 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] and other observers. 
<H5>  Review of Work in the Past Year </H5>
  Nineteen ninety-three was a year in which we comprehensively 
implemented the spirit of the 14th party congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. During the 
year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, under the 
leadership of the party Central Committee, the State Council, 
and the CPC Yunnan Province Party Committee, and in accordance 
with requirements for the building of a socialist market 
economic structure, as well as resolutions adopted by the first 
meeting of the 8th provincial people's congress, Yunnan's 
governments at all levels have led the people of all 
nationalities to deepen reform on a constant basis, vigorously 
expand the scope of opening up, work hard to speed up the pace 
of development, and overcome all kinds of difficulties, thus 
creating a new situation in all aspects of work. 
  I. The national economy maintained fairly fast 
growth.GNP was 64.8 billion yuan in 1993 (calculated at 
current prices), representing an increase of 10 percent over the 
1992 figure (calculated at comparable prices). Conquering 
serious national disasters, agriculture enjoyed a fairly good 
harvest, and added agricultural value increased by 2.2 percent 
over the previous year. The production of most major 
agricultural and sideline products was better than that of the 
previous year, among which grain output reached 10.85 billion 
kg, the second highest yield in history. Steady growth has been 
registered in animal husbandry and fisheries. Total meat output 
was 1.023 million tonnes, while output of aquatic products stood 
at 58,000 tonnes, up by 10.7 and 8.6 percent respectively. 
Township and town enterprises enjoyed rapid development, with 
total revenue reaching 22.4 billion yuan, up by 71.6 percent. 
Industrial production maintained stable growth, with improved 
economic efficiency. Added industrial value went up by 13 
percent over the previous year. Yunnan's advantages in the "two 
tobaccos" were brought into better play, and the total output 
value of the tobacco processing industry amounted to 19.1 
billion yuan, registering a 20.5-percent increase. Output of 
all major products, including cigarettes, sugar, generating 
capacity, steel, finished steel products, and cement rose over 
the previous year. The volume of outbound freight moved by rail 
stood at 10.17 million tonne, representing an increase of 5.1 
percent. Posts and telecommunications enjoyed fairly fast 
development, with a 55.6 percent increase in the scale of 
operations. Urban and rural markets enjoyed brisk business and 
an ample supply of goods, and the volume of retail sales rose by 
25.8 percent. Local financial revenue for the year totalled 
20.04 billion yuan. Fairly good results were scored in both 
afforestation and environmental protection. 
  II. New strides taken in economic structural reform, 
and results registered in exercising macroeconomic control and 
regulation. In 1993, in accordance with the arrangements of 
the party Central Committee and the State Council and in the 
light of Yunnan's actual conditions, new headway was made in 
many fields of endeavor, such as deepening rural reform; 
changing the operational mechanism of state-owned enterprises; 
building up a market system; perfecting the social guarantee 
system, the land use system, and the housing system; and 
transforming the functions of government. A total of 114 
counties (cities) relaxed controls over the purchase and selling 
prices of grain and continued efforts were taken to readjust and 
decontrol prices of most of the major means of production, 
including transportation and energy. Improvement was registered 
in the general application of market principles by Yunnan's 
economic sectors. Since the second half of last year, we 
conscientiously carried out all of the central authorities' 
measures on strengthening and improving macroeconomic control 
and regulation, and we scored positive results. 
  The 
financial order took an obvious turn for the better. The 
balance of all kinds of savings deposits in banks at year-end 
amounted to 49.38 billion yuan, representing an increase of 20.7 
percent over the beginning of the year, while total loans and 
currency issued in the whole year were controlled within the 
scope specified in the state plan. High-speed growth of 
fixed-assets investment was slowed, contradictions between the 
supply and demand of the major means of production, such as 
sheet steel and cement, were eased, and the national economy 
attained healthy development while enjoying sustained and speedy 
growth. 
  III. Remarkable results were registered in the 
construction of key projects. To ensure the construction 
of key projects, we screened all projects under construction, 
abolished a number of general projects, and concentrated our 
efforts on speeding up the construction pace of 27 indispensable 
projects, which were selected from a total of 47 key projects in 
the original development plan. A total of 14 projects and 
individual projects were completed and put into operation, 
including the exhibition hall of the Kunming Commodity Exchange 
Fair, the terminal area of Kunming Airport, Shaotong Airport, 
and the Kunming-Yuxi Highway. The fifth and sixth generating 
units of Manwan Power Station and the Mankun 500-Kv Transmission 
and Transformer Project were completed and put into production, 
marking the beginning of a new level of power construction in 
Yunnan. The completion of the Kunming-Yuxi Railway and the 
Guangchu section of the Guangda Railway showed the historic 
results of Yunnan in building local railways. The completion 
and operation of three optical fibers linking Dali and Ruili, 
Kunming and Pingdi, and Kunming and Yuxi under the first phase 
of the Tianxi digital microwave project further eased Yunnan's 
tight supply of telecommunications services. Through 
technological transformation, the Kunming Iron and Steel Plant 
attained an annual steel output of over 1 million tonnes, while 
the Lanjian Light Vehicle Factory and the Dongfeng Gaoyuan Motor 
Truck Factory had the ability to produce more than 10,000 
vehicles a year respectively. The completion of the 
240,000-tonne compound fertilizer project at the Yunnan 
Nitrogenous Fertilizer Plant and the 120,000-tonne ammonium 
phosphate project at the Honghe Prefectural Phosphate Fertilizer 
Plant pushed Yunnan's annual production capacity of ammonium 
phosphate to 640,000 tonnes. Songhuaba Reservoir in Kunming had 
newly added storage capacity of 150 million cubic meters, thus 
improving Kunming's water supply. Initial results were also 
registered in the renovation and construction of the former war 
zone. All of these accomplishments stated above will play an 
important role in reinforcing Yunnan's economic strength and 
potential for further development. 
  4. The scale of opening up was further expanded. 
During the past year, while continuing to consolidate and 
promote existing economic and trade relations with over 100 
countries and regions, Yunnan further stepped up contacts with 
neighboring countries as well as southeast Asian countries. 
Laos and Burma respectively set up consulate generals in 
Kunming; the Hekou, Tianbao, and Jinshuihe outlets for export 
produce along the Sino-Vietnamese border, as well as the Mohan 
outlet along the Sino-Laotian border, were reopened; a number of 
new national-level ports were opened for exports, including 
Jinhong Port, Simao Port, Tianbao, and Jinshuihe; and Yunnan 
Airlines formally opened international routes from Kunming to 
Singapore and Bangkok and put chartered planes into operation 
for package tours to Malaysia. We successfully held the first 
session of the Kunming Commodity Exchange Fair, giving great 
impetus to the southwestern region in its efforts to enter 
southeast Asian markets. Continued progress was attained in 
foreign-related economic and trade work as a result of our 
efforts to deepen reform and overcome difficulties. The annual 
import and export volume totalled $840 million, while that of 
border trade amounted to 2.87 billion yuan, up by 25.3 and 26.6 
percent respectively over the 1992 figures. A total of 509 
foreign-invested enterprises were approved in Yunnan, and 
foreign investment totalling $188 million was utilized, thus 
speeding up the pace of the introduction of foreign investment. 
A 74.1-percent increase was registered in the turnover of 
construction projects contracted abroad and labor cooperative 
services. During the year, Yunnan received a total of 405,000 
overseas tourists, and earned $104 million of foreign exchange 
from tourism, up by 29.3 and 53.8 percent respectively. 
Entailing a total contract amount of 1.3 billion yuan, 1,226 
joint and cooperative projects of various kinds were started 
both inside and outside Yunnan, playing a positive role in 
promoting the economic development of our province. 
  5. New results were attained in education, science 
and technology, and all other social undertakings. Efforts 
were made to strengthen elementary education. The provincial 
government basically fulfilled its plan to raise 50 million yuan 
for the establishment of 1,000 extra primary schools and 200 
extra junior middle schools. Nine-year compulsory education was 
implemented in four more cities (prefectures), while six-year 
compulsory education was basically made universal in 23 counties 
(cities). Vocational and technical education underwent under 
constant development. With the total number of students 
surpassing that of students attending ordinary middle schools, 
secondary vocational and technical schools successfully brought 
up and trained a large number of elementary and 
intermediate-level technical personnel for every front of 
Yunnan's endeavor. Smooth progress was made in optimizing the 
structure and readjusting the setup of higher education, and the 
State Council has already given approval to our plan to set up 
the Yunnan Industrial University. Strides were taken to build 
the Yunnan University into one of China's 100 key institutions 
of higher learning, and the provincial government has already 
allocated 20 million yuan to improve teaching conditions in the 
university. Major headway was made on reforming the province's 
enrollment and distribution system, and the practice of 
respecting teachers and education is being turned into a sound 
general practice for the whole of society. The concept that 
"science and technology is the primary productive force" has 
gradually become a consensus of the people of all nationalities 
across the province, and the contribution rate of scientific and 
technological progresses to economic development has been 
enhanced. Efforts were taken to speed up the pace of 
industrializing and commercializing scientific and technological 
results. Governments at provincial, prefectural, and county 
levels are all engaged in a number of related projects, and a 
large number of scientific and technological products were put 
into batch production. Constantly deepened reform of the 
scientific and technological structure aroused the enthusiasm of 
the vast numbers of scientific and technological personnel, who 
subsequently scored gratifying results in projects and 
enterprises they had contracted or taken charge of. New 
breakthroughs were made on reforming the fund allocation system 
in scientific research institutions. Basic and applied research 
were strengthened, and a number of new results were attained in 
social scientific research. Contributing to enhancing economic 
efficiency, a total of 226 scientific research results won 
national and provincial-level awards for scientific and 
technological progresses as well as spark prizes. Public health 
made constant development, and new headway was made in improving 
public health and elementary medical care in rural areas. Among 
18 counties (cities) which were selected to carry out 
experiments with elementary medical care, 15 passed appraisals 
and fulfilled the requirements of the state. The incidence of 
contagious diseases stated in all kinds of statutory reports 
dropped for the twelfth year in succession. Family planning was 
constantly strengthened. The natural population growth rate of 
the province in 1993 stood at 13.9 per thousand, showing that 
excessive population growth has been basically brought under 
control. A total of 143 projects relating to the construction 
of the 1,000-li border cultural corridor were started, while the 
provincial folk art exhibition proved a success. Comprehensive 
efforts were taken to facilitate cultural exchanges with foreign 
countries. Rapid progress was registered in the development of 
radio and television. A plan to build 8,000 township and 
village-level satellite surface reception stations was fulfilled 
one year ahead of schedule, thus enhancing the television 
coverage rate from 72 percent in the previous year to 77 
percent. Mass sports were carried out in an extensive way. 
Yunnan's athletes won a total of 69 prizes in a number of major 
national-level and international competitions, thus winning 
honors for our motherland and Yunnan. New results were also 
scored in all social undertakings, including the press and 
publishing. 
  6. The living standards of urban and rural residents 
were further improved. Alongside the development of the 
economy and with more employment opportunities, urban and rural 
residents are enjoying higher incomes, and their living 
standards are also under constant improvement. During the year, 
a total of 89,000 job-waiting people in urban areas were given 
employment, and the year-end job-awaiting rate stood at 2.2 
percent. The per capita income used by urban dwellers as living 
expenses and the per capita net income of peasants reached 2,376 
and 675 yuan respectively after allowing for price rises, 
representing an increase of 8.2 and 1.3 percent respectively 
over the previous year. Annual per capita savings deposits of 
urban and rural residents at year-end stood at 647 yuan, 136 
yuan more than at the end of the previous year. Living 
conditions in both urban and rural areas were constantly 
improved, and the spiritual and cultural life of urban and rural 
residents was increasingly enriched. To help the masses tide 
over current difficulties in production and daily life in the 
wake of serious national disasters, governments at all levels 
promptly organized the masses to provide for and help themselves 
by engaging in production, allocated 233 million yuan as relief 
funds, and made appropriate arrangements for the production and 
daily lives of the masses in both disaster-stricken and poor 
areas. 
  7. Democracy and the legal system were constantly 
improved, and the building of spiritual civilization was further 
strengthened.The provincial government conscientiously 
implemented resolutions and decisions adopted by the provincial 
people's congress and its standing committee, subjected itself 
to the supervision of the people's congress, further 
strengthened democratic consultation with the provincial CPPCC, 
as well as various democratic parties and non-party personages, 
and carefully handled letters and visits from the masses. Both 
deputies to the provincial people's congress and provincial 
CPPCC members put forward many suggestions on promoting reform, 
opening up, economic construction, and social development. We 
conscientiously studied and adopted their suggestions with a 
positive attitude with a view to enhance our decision-making 
skills. Headway was made in local legislation. During the past 
year, the provincial government submitted for examination and 
approval six local laws and regulations to the standing 
committee of the provincial people's congress, including 
"Provisions of Yunnan Province on Protecting the Interests and 
Rights of Consumers," and formulated 23 governmental 
regulations. Meanwhile, departments under the provincial 
government as well as governments at all levels also worked out 
a number of documents of standardization; and in line with the 
spirit of the 14th party congress, organized governments at 
county level and above as well as their affiliated departments 
to screen all existing documents of standardization, thus 
enhancing their awareness of the need to administer government 
according to the law. We vigorously carried out special-duty 
struggles against smuggling and drugs and arms trafficking, 
handed down severe punishment to all kinds of criminals, 
eliminated social evils, further implemented measures for a 
comprehensive improvement of public security, strengthened the 
building of the law-enforcement contingent, and successfully 
safeguarded the political and social stability of the entire 
province. The lawyer and notary system was gradually put into 
practice. Education in professional ethics and social morality 
continued to be carried out in both urban and rural areas on an 
extensive scale. Joint activities of building socialist 
spiritual civilization between the Army and the people and 
between the police and the people were under constant 
development. Vigorous efforts were taken to carry out mass 
cultural and recreational activities which are good for the 
people's health, thus further promoting the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization. 
  8. Accomplishments were made in the current phase of 
the anticorruption campaign. Governments at all levels 
conscientiously acted in line with the decision of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council, carried out the 
anti-corruption campaign in depth, and scored certain results. 
In May last year, this government called its first routine 
meeting to study the issue of building a clean administration 
and worked out six stipulations for leading members of the 
provincial government on being clean and honest when carrying 
out official duties. 
  Cadres at the county level and above in 
government organs carried out criticism and self-criticism, and 
measured themselves by the central authorities' five 
requirements for party and government leading cadres to remain 
clean and honest. Working in close coordination with relevant 
sides, supervisory departments put on file and handled 613 major 
cases, of which 484 were concluded. Efforts were taken to 
straighten unhealthy practices which the people resent most, 
including arbitrary fund collection and fee apportionment. The 
provincial government publicly abolished 11 irrational charges, 
and with the addition of charges abolished by all prefectures, 
autonomous prefectures, and cities, heavy burdens on enterprises 
and the masses were lightened by over 380 million yuan a year. 
Efforts were also taken to rectify other incorrect practices, 
such as party and government organs running economic entities, 
traveling at the expense of the state, and cadres embezzling 
public funds. Governments at all levels worked out measures to 
maintain a clean and honest administration with a view to 
gradually systemizing and legalizing the work of combatting 
corruption and advocating a clean administration. 
  Fellow Deputies: 
  Over the last year, we have stepped up economic development, 
promoted unity among all nationalities, and consolidated border 
defense, thus bringing stability to the entire society. It is 
the Army and the people of the whole province who, through their 
hard struggle in unity, have made all these achievements 
possible. On behalf of the provincial people's government, I 
wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to the people of all 
nationalities, the vast numbers of cadres, and all officers and 
men of People's Liberation Army units and armed police 
garrisoning Yunnan. I also wish to express our sincere thanks 
to all our domestic and international friends who care about and 
support Yunnan's construction. While recognizing our 
achievements, we must also be aware that we are still faced with 
many difficulties and problems on the way ahead, and there have 
been failings and mistakes in the work of the government. These 
are chiefly the following. Agricultural production was affected 
by serious national disasters; as a result, prices of the means 
of agricultural production went up by a large margin, the 
comparable efficiency of agriculture dropped, and growth of 
peasants' incomes slowed down. Tobacco production experienced a 
bigger drop than expected as a result of natural disasters. 
Because the quality of tobacco was not as good as before and 
also because of a failure to adopt prompt measures to boost 
tobacco purchases, overall economic returns on tobacco and the 
incomes of tobacco growers were impaired to a certain extent. 
Structural contradictions with economic development remain 
conspicuous, and a considerable number of enterprises found 
themselves in a difficult situation. Retail prices in the 
market rose by an excessively large margin, thus affecting the 
normal operations of the economy and the improvement of people's 
living standards to a certain extent. Many problems still exist 
in public security, and some evil phenomena keep emerging 
despite repeated bans. To counter all existing problems and 
difficulties, the provincial people's government will make 
detailed studies, adopt effective measures, and make every 
effort to solve these problems one after the other. Meanwhile, 
we sincerely hope that all delegates to the provincial party 
congress as well as provincial CPPCC members can offer their 
criticism and suggestions with a view to helping us do a better 
job. 
<H5>  Major Tasks for 1994 </H5>
  The sound development of the economy will maintain its 
momentum in 1994, an important year for advancing reform. The 
following is a basic guiding principle for the work of the 
provincial government: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as well as the party's basic line, the 
provincial government will comprehensively implement the spirit 
of the 14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee; vigorously promote all reforms which 
are aimed at establishing a socialist economic structure; 
further expand the scope of opening up; maintain sustained, 
rapid, and healthy national economic growth; strengthen the 
building of socialist spiritual civilization, socialist 
democracy, and the legal system; safeguard political stability; 
and bring progress to all sectors of society. In other 
words, we should adhere to the guiding principle of this year's 
work, which was raised by the party Central Committee and the 
State Council, act in light of Yunnan's actual 
conditions,make up our mind to further emancipate the 
mind, seize favorable opportunities, deepen reform, expand 
opening up, step up development, and maintain stability. 
  In line with this requirement, the provincial government 
has set the GNP growth rate for 1994 at 10 percent, total grain 
output at 11.25 billion kg, total revenue of township and town 
enterprises at over 32 billion yuan, and the growth rate of 
completed work in kind for fixed-assets investment across 
society at 5 percent. After adopting the new fiscal and 
taxation system, local financial revenue will total 6.67 billion 
yuan; the total import and export volume will reach $950 
million, representing an increase of 13 percent; the retail 
price index of commodities in society will be controlled below 
13 percent; the per capita net income of peasants and the per 
capita income used by urban dwellers as living expenses will 
grow at about 5 and 6 percent respectively after allowing for 
price rises; and the natural population growth rate will be 
controlled below 14 per thousand. 
  To accomplish the above tasks, we must concentrate our 
efforts on work in the following fields: 
<H5>  I. Step Up Our Work as a Whole, Concentrate Efforts on Key </H5>
Issues, and Speed up the Pace of Establishing a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure 
  China's economic structural reform has entered a crucial 
stage, and a series of major measures will be promulgated this 
year guiding reforms in the finance and taxation, banking, 
planning, investment, and foreign trade systems, as well as the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system. Reform has been 
carried out from superficial levels to deeper levels, from 
individual reforms to comprehensive reform packages, and from 
stressing relatively independent reform measures to emphasizing 
comprehensive new economic relations. Since reform involves 
many sides, we will surely encounter many new situations and 
problems. In view of this, we must strengthen leadership, make 
careful arrangements, appropriately handle all kinds of 
complicated social contradictions that might crop up, 
successfully coordinate different interest relations, mobilize 
the enthusiasm of all sectors, and unswervingly carry out reform 
in depth. 
  The establishment of a modern enterprise system is an 
inevitable requirement of the development of socialized general 
production and the market economy, and also the direction of 
reform for state-owned enterprises. The modern enterprise 
system is basically featured by transparent property rights, 
defined powers and responsibilities, separate functions of 
government and enterprises, and scientific management. With 
regard to deepening enterprise reform, Yunnan will concentrate 
its attention on the following issues this year: 1) Continued 
efforts will be taken to implement the "Law on Industrial 
Enterprises Under the Ownership of the Whole People," 
"Regulations on Changing the Operational Mechanisms of 
Industrial Enterprises Under the Ownership of the Whole People," 
and implementation measures of our province, and will ensure 
that all enterprises exercise their rights and responsibilities 
in actuality. Experimental enterprises which have obtained 
approval to change their operational mechanism should pay close 
attention to working out measures and methods which suit the new 
fiscal and taxation system. 2) A total of 30 state-owned large 
and medium enterprises will be selected across the province to 
carry out experiments with the modern enterprise system. 3) 
Experiments with the standard shareholding system will be 
carried out in more enterprises. We will speed up the pace of 
transforming state-owned enterprises into shareholding 
enterprises, and make every effort to put the shareholding 
system into practice in key projects. 4) Contractual 
management or leasing management will be adopted in small state- 
owned enterprises. Such enterprises can also be transformed 
into shareholding cooperative enterprises or sold to collectives 
and individuals. 5) A good job needs to be done to converge 
the contracted enterprise system with the unified enterprise 
income tax system, and to accelerate reform of the internal 
labor, personnel, and distribution systems in enterprises. 6) 
We should pay close attention to fixed-assets appraisal, fund 
circulation, the definition of property rights, assets 
evaluation, and the settlement of debts. 7) Efforts will be 
made to transform urban and rural collective enterprises, 
township and town enterprises, and nongovernmental scientific 
and technological enterprises into shareholding cooperative 
enterprises and to encourage privately run enterprises to 
reorganize themselves into standardized companies. 
  Accelerating the cultivation and development of market 
systems is one of the key tasks of this year's reform. The 
provincial government plans to set up a leading group and a fund 
for market building. It is necessary to continue reducing 
mandatory plans and gradually perfect the commodity market. A 
good job needs to be done in the building of markets at 
different levels, including the international trade market, 
border trade market, specialized wholesale market, and the urban 
and rural trade fair market, and to explore ways to set up a 
futures market. It is imperative to vigorously develop the real 
estate market, as well as markets for various means of 
production, including finance, technology, labor power, and 
information. We should raise funds for market building through 
different channels and should try our best to build up the 
market by adopting a share-holding system. Remote mountain 
areas, areas inhabited by minority nationalities and poor areas 
can set up markets first and standardize them later, with a view 
to accelerating the pace of market building. We should 
conscientiously implement the "Law Against Unfair Competition 
Practices," formulate market regulations, and gradually build up 
and perfect market order. Through cultivating and developing the 
market system, we will gradually give form to a unified and open 
market setup which has its own special features and enjoys 
standardized operations. 
  Major strides should be taken this year in reforming the 
financial, investment, planning, and foreign trade systems. The 
provincial government will make every effort to implement all 
reform measures in line with the arrangements of the State 
Council. To make a success of financial structural reform, at 
the same time as the central bank sets up a powerful and 
effective macroeconomic control and regulation system, Yunnan 
will pay close attention to making preparations for the 
establishment of urban and rural cooperative banks, vigorously 
develop and strictly control the financial market, do a good job 
in stock issuance, make flexible use of credit in stock, 
actively attract foreign funds, and try hard to alleviate the 
shortage of funds for economic construction. As regards the 
reform of the investment structure, since greater autonomy has 
been granted to enterprises and financial structural reform has 
been deepened, enterprises will gradually become the main body 
of economic construction and investment. On the other hand, the 
main function of the government is to guide the investment 
direction, optimize the investment structure, and maintain a 
rational investment scale through macroeconomic policies and 
economic levers. Strides will be taken to reinforce the 
investment risk restriction mechanism, vigorously put into 
practice the enterprise legal person responsibility system and 
the investment decision-making responsibility system, and set up 
a provincial-level infrastructural construction fund system as 
well as a provincial investment company. The direction of 
planning reform is to strengthen macrocontrol, strategic 
importance, and the policymaking role of the planning work, and 
formulate medium and long-term plans, improve comprehensive 
coordination, gradually set up a provincial-level reserve system 
and a regulation fund for key commodities, and increase the 
capacity of the government to exercise macroeconomic control and 
regulation. The goal of foreign trade structural reform is to 
set up an operational mechanism which is well in line with 
international practices and continuous efforts should be taken 
to uphold the reform direction featured by unified policies, 
relaxed control over operations, fair competition, full 
financial responsibility, the integration of industry and trade, 
and practicing an agency system. Meanwhile, we must see to it 
that autonomy is granted to more large and medium enterprises so 
that they can make decisions on matters concerning their own 
import and export operations. With a view to bringing about a 
stable transition to reforming the import and export management 
system, three mandatory plans will remain in use this year on 
the total important and export volume, total foreign exchange 
earned from exports, and the total amount of foreign exchange 
actually utilized. 
  The new fiscal and taxation system has been in effect since 
1 January this year. The focus of this reform is to transform 
the existing local contracted financial system into a tax 
division system which is based on separating the powers of the 
central and local authorities. The purpose of the reform is to 
assure local governments of vested financial gains in 1993, 
appropriately pool new increases, reinforce the capacity of the 
central authorities in exercising macroeconomic control and 
regulation, regulate the distribution and district structures, 
assist less advanced areas to attain development, and to urge 
governments at all levels as well as enterprises to strengthen 
management, enhance economic efficiency, and increase income. 
Since Yunnan's financial revenue and growth mainly rely on the 
"two tobaccos," it has become an important and urgent task for 
us, after submitting most of our cigarette income to the state 
in the form of consumption tax, to maintain the constant growth 
of local financial revenue while ensuring increases in financial 
revenue for the central authorities. In order to make it easier 
for all localities to gradually adapt themselves to the new 
financial structure, the provincial authorities have decided to 
maintain the existing financial contract method for another year 
and will not put into using the new structure until next year. 
To counter the new problems which have cropped up in our 
economic work in the wake of fiscal and taxation structural 
reform, such as increased costs of transportation, difficulties 
in the production and management of materials for agricultural 
use, and decreased income from localities carrying out border 
trade, the provincial government has organized forces to make 
investigations into and study these problems one by one to work 
out appropriate solutions. It is necessary to conscientiously 
carry out all of the measures designed for fiscal and taxation 
structural reform, strengthen the collection and management of 
taxation, organize tax collection in a timely manner, estimate 
our own strength and act accordingly, make rational arrangements 
for expenses, and maintain balanced revenue and expenditure. 
  Besides doing a good job in the above key reforms, we will 
also pay close attention to reforming the science and 
technology, education, social guarantee, and housing systems. 
<H5>  II. Earnestly Strengthen the Foundation of Agriculture and </H5>
Bring About a Comprehensive Development to the Rural Economy 
  Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and 
this concept can never be shaken under any circumstances. To 
establish a socialist market economic structure, we must 
comprehensively implement the "Law of the People's Republic of 
China on Agriculture"; further reinforce the basic position of 
agriculture; unswervingly attach importance to and strengthen 
the foundation of agriculture; conscientiously carry out the 
principles set out by the central authorities at the national 
rural work meeting; stabilize the party's basic rural policies; 
deepen rural reform; reinforce the construction of agricultural 
basic facilities; readjust the agricultural structure, as well 
as the rural economic structure; take the road of high yield, 
fine quality, and high efficiency; increase the peasants' income 
in a steady way; and bring comprehensive development to the 
rural economy. 
  First, we should stabilize policies and deepen reform. It is 
necessary to continue stabilizing the system of contract 
responsibility on a household basis with remuneration linked to 
output, fully respect peasants' autonomy in agricultural 
operations, extend the original farmland contract period by 
another 30 years, and allow the practice of compensated 
subcontracts. The right to use reserve resources, such as 
uncultivated mountains, land, and shoals, can be sold with 
compensation or contracted for development in various forms at 
different levels. Compensated sales and contract periods of 
such reserve resources can be extended, and the right to use 
these resources is inheritable. Vigorous efforts should be 
taken to develop the rural socialized service system and put 
such operational patterns as trade, industry, and agriculture 
complexes into practice, as well as an integrated system for the 
procurement of supplies, production, and marketing. Efforts 
will be made to successfully carry out reform of the supply and 
marketing cooperative system. While raising purchasing prices 
of grain, we will pay close attention to the establishment of a 
grain risk fund. After the state lifts its controls over the 
prices of the means of agricultural production, the provincial 
government will adopt positive measures to protect the interest 
of peasants; put the brakes on unhealthy practices, such as 
unjustified financial levies, the arbitrary collection of fees, 
and the arbitrary acquisition of funds; and continue to try hard 
to lighten peasants' heavy burdens. 
  Second, we will increase inputs into agriculture through 
various channels. This year, budgetary provincial-level 
investment earmarked for the construction of basic agricultural 
facilities and special-purpose agricultural funds allocated by 
provincial financial departments have both increased over last 
year. All governments should act in line with the stipulations 
of the central authorities and increase their financial inputs 
into agricultural. Agricultural loans granted by financial 
organs should grow at a higher rate than loans of other kinds, 
and the total amount of newly granted agricultural loans should 
also exceed the level of last year. The proportion of inputs 
into agricultural scientific and technological progress should 
be raised among the three high-tech inputs. Starting this year, 
the newly levied land value-added tax will mainly be used for 
the comprehensive development of agriculture. We will give 
positive guidance to rural collective economic organizations and 
peasants, and encourage them to increase inputs into 
agriculture. Efforts will be made to help peasants run well 
rural cooperative foundations and gradually increase the amount 
and expand the utilization scope of foreign funds in agriculture. 
  Third, continued efforts will be made to carry out the basic 
construction of water conservancy works. For many years 
running, Yunnan has successfully built up large-scale water 
conservancy works and attained remarkable results. This year, 
we will step up our efforts and strive for greater results. The 
pace of building 25 million mu of farmland with high and stable 
yields should be accelerated, and over 2.1 million mu of medium 
and low-yield fields will be transformed this year. We will 
raise 1.3 billion yuan through various channels to build 39 
large and medium-scale water conservancy works, including those 
in Yudong, Wulichong, and Chaishitan, ensuring the completion of 
14 of them within this year; mobilize the masses to build up 
over 200,000 small irrigation and water conservancy works; 
increase irrigated areas by 1 million mu; and strive to bring 42 
percent of all the farmland in the province under irrigation. 
It is necessary to protect and make rational use of farmland. 
Development zones of all kinds should make use of fields on 
idle slopes and hills and allow peasants to cultivate 
requisitioned fields which will not be developed for other use 
in near future. 
  Fourth, it is imperative to constantly optimize the 
structure 
of the rural economy. Under the prerequisite of ensuring the 
stable production of grain and oil crops, we will enhance 
efficiency, increase the income of peasants, and go all out to 
readjust the agricultural structure and the rural economic 
structure with the aim of earning more foreign exchange. It is 
important to rely on science and technology to enhance per unit 
area yield and the quality and total output of grain. We will 
bring into better play our advantages in tobacco, sugar cane, 
and tea. To boost production of tobacco, we will 
conscientiously act in line with the state's plans, give 
priority to the best tobacco-producing areas, and strive to 
enhance both the quality and efficiency of tobacco production. 
Efforts will be made to step up the development of forestry, 
animal husbandry, and fisheries and set up a number of 
production bases of a certain scale. Vigorous efforts will be 
made to boost production of fruit, dried fruit, coffee, 
vegetables, silkworms, flowers, medicinal herbs, and spices, and 
to cultivate exchange-earning agricultural industries. It is 
imperative to give positive support to the development of 
secondary and tertiary industries in rural areas, process more 
agricultural and sideline products, do a good job in circulation 
and all services, and bring prosperity to the rural economy. 
  Fifth, vigorous efforts should be taken to spread the use of 
applied agricultural scientific and technological results. We 
should conscientiously implement the "Law of the People's 
Republic of China on Spreading Agrotechniques," carry out the 
"harvest program" in a comprehensive manner, expand areas sown 
to hybrid rice and hybrid maize, and grow hybrid rice in the 80 
percent of farmland which is good for growing rice and growing 
hybrid maize in over 55 percent of the total sown area. Strides 
will be taken to vigorously spread the use of advanced 
agricultural scientific and technological results and all 
applied techniques, try hard to standardize and model the 
cultivation of grain and oil crops, promote agricultural 
production in winter, and ensure that the output of grain and 
cooking oil attain steady growth. 
  Sixth, we should do a good job in comprehensive development 
and accelerate the construction of commodity bases. After 
completing the first phase of a comprehensive agricultural 
development project in southwestern Yunnan, which entails an 
investment of 280 million yuan, we will invest another 310 
million yuan in the second phase of the project. To develop the 
dry and hot river valley area of the Jinsha Jiang, the 
provincial government has decided to start a comprehensive 
agricultural development project along the middle reaches of the 
Jinsha Jiang, involving 26 counties (cities) in eight 
prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities. Entailing a 
total investment of 900 million yuan, this project will be 
completed in two phases, and 450 million will be invested in the 
first phase. The provincial authorities have already arranged a 
number of motivational projects, striving to attain results at 
the earliest possible time. The development project aims to 
turn the rich resources of this hot area into the huge wealth of 
the vast numbers of the masses as soon as possible in an effort 
to extricate them from poverty and become rich, and to build the 
1,000-li river valley into a beautiful and fertile green 
corridor. Meanwhile, we should speed up the construction of 
production and exchange-earning commodity grain, pig, cattle, 
sheep, milk, and egg bases, as well as bases for sugar, tea, 
fruit, and forestry. We will run well Kunming's high-yield, 
fine-quality, and high-efficiency agricultural demonstration 
zones and pay close attention to agricultural projects which 
utilize foreign funds. 
  Seventh, we will go all out to develop township and town 
enterprises. In line with the principle of "emancipating the 
mind, giving a free hand, providing support, and bringing about 
great development," we will conscientiously carry out relevant 
stipulations respectively put forward by the state and the 
provincial authorities; through deepening reform and expanding 
opening up, optimize the structure and accelerate development by 
various means; and strive for high-speed and healthy 
development. Preferential policies will be adopted to support 
the building materials industry, "green enterprises," mines and 
the metallurgical industry, and tertiary industries. Through 
market-oriented resource development, we will build up a number 
of villages, townships, and towns which can respectively earn 
over 100 million to several hundred million yuan a year, and 
with relatively concentrated methods, set up small-scale 
township and town enterprise zones, thus bringing faster 
development to township and town enterprises. It is important 
to encourage scientific and technological personnel to take 
charge of township and town enterprises in rural areas, 
especially in remote mountain areas. We will provide more 
training for our workers and staff, vigorously introduce able 
personnel and technology, and develop new highly competitive and 
much-demanded products. It is imperative to pay close attention 
to the management and rectification of existing enterprises, 
perfect their operational mechanisms, and enhance the quality as 
well as the economic and social efficiency of enterprises. 
Construction of small cities and towns should be strengthened 
so as to bring along and promote the development of township and 
town enterprises. 
<H5>  III. Promote Transportation and Industrial Production, and </H5>
Enhance Economic Efficiency 
  Making a success of transportation and industrial production 
is an important guarantee for the sustained development of the 
national economy. The conspicuous problems currently facing 
Yunnan's transportation and industrial enterprises include 
inferior-quality products, poor economic efficiency, and the 
shortage of funds. Motivated by efforts to deepen reform and 
accelerate the establishment of a modern enterprise system, we 
will make greater efforts to bring about a comprehensive balance 
and coordination to the work, and enable industrial and 
communications production to attain sustained and rapid growth 
on the basis of an optimized structure and enhanced efficiency. 
  We will persistently act in accordance with market demands 
and bring about a balance between production and sales. It is 
necessary to guide industrial enterprises to open themselves to 
both domestic and international markets, organize production in 
the light of market changes, and give priority to the 
development of products which are economically efficient and 
highly competitive and enjoy a high technological starting point 
and high added value. It is imperative to give support to the 
production of people's daily necessities, aid-agriculture 
products, and products for exports in terms of funds, energy, 
and transportation, and to restrict the production of 
unmarketable goods which are of inferior quality and poor 
economic efficiency. Enterprises should vigorously carry out 
activities of creating brand-name products, place the quality of 
products above everything else, vigorously develop marketable 
new products and new varieties, and constantly enhance the 
competitive capacity of products made in Yunnan in both domestic 
and international markets. 
  Strengthening technical transformation and pushing forward 
the technological progress of enterprises is an important means 
and material foundation for increasing the vitality of 
enterprises. This year, Yunnan's investment in technological 
transformation will increase by 20 percent over last year. We 
will focus our efforts on a number of technological 
transformation projects, such as the third technical renovation 
of cigarette production, light vehicle production, the 
high-speed wire rod rolling mills of the Kunming Iron and Steel 
Plant, and the Yangzonhai Power Plant. Meanwhile, we will also 
pay close attention to the technological transformation of 
products which are in high demand, such as fine-quality raw 
materials, fine-quality fertilizers for agricultural use, and 
highly competitive export products, thus upgrading and updating 
Yunnan's products. Continued efforts will be taken to 
strengthen joint development between production units, 
institutions of higher learning, and scientific research 
institutes, set up a risk fund for commercialization of 
scientific results, and speed up the pace of turning scientific 
and technological achievements into realistic productive forces. 
Technological development centers will be set up in 10 large 
and medium enterprises with a view to activating their inherent 
motives to seek technological progress, encourage and support 
them to achieve technological progress, and enhance their 
technological management level. 
  We will attach greater importance to and strengthen the 
internal management of enterprises. At present, heavy losses 
have been incurred by a considerable number of enterprises in 
Yunnan as a result of their failure to strengthen weak links in 
work, strictly enforce rules and regulations, and exercise 
proper internal management. People's government at all levels 
should guide enterprises to strengthen management, give full 
play to the role of the working class as masters, mobilize the 
enthusiasm of the vast numbers of workers and staff to respect 
their factories, love their work, and forge ahead, and give 
impetus to enterprises to voluntarily strengthen their internal 
strength. It is necessary to set up a perfect internal economic 
responsibility system as well as various feasible rules, 
regulations, and systems; put into practice targeted management; 
and optimize on-site management. We will attach great 
importance to safety in production and prevent the occurrence of 
serious accidents. We will carry out the activity of dual 
increases and dual retrenchments, pay close attention to making 
up deficits and increasing profits, make comprehensive use of 
resources, broaden sources of income and reduce expenditure, and 
tap production potential. Hard efforts will be taken to reduce 
energy consumption and raw material and production costs, speed 
up the circulation of funds, enhance the utilization efficiency 
of funds and the economic efficiency of enterprises, and further 
reduce the total number of loss-making enterprises and the total 
amount of operational losses compared to last year. 
<H5>  IV. Maintain A Rational Investment Scale, Continue To </H5>
Strengthen Key Construction 
  The guiding ideology of Yunnan's fixed-assets investment 
this 
year is: To maintain an appropriate investment scale, reduce 
the number of general projects, continue strengthening key 
construction and major technological transformation projects, 
and strive to greatly increase productive capacity. In line 
with the principle of ensuring the completion and production of 
projects, ensuring continued projects, and ensuring newly 
started key projects, the provincial government has decided to 
concentrate strength on 57 key construction projects, which 
entail a total investment of 8.6 billion yuan. Among the 57 
projects, 34 are basic construction projects taking an 
investment of 6.5 billion yuan; 15 are technological 
transformation projects, entailing an investment of 1.5 billion 
yuan; and eight are aid-the-poor projects. These are mainly 
major raw and semi-finished materials projects in the fields of 
water conservancy, energy, communications, telecommunications, 
metallurgy, and industrial chemicals. It is estimated that 
generating capacity will increase by 500,000 kw, high-grade 
highways by 176 km, the mining capacity of state-owned mines by 
300,000 tonnes, and cement production by 320,000 tonnes. 
Measures should be taken to ensure the completion of key 
projects in the restoration and construction of former war zone. 
We should pay close attention to making first-phase 
preparations for enterprises and to enhance the utilization 
efficiency of funds. To ensure the smooth implementation of key 
construction plans, we should firmly ban or suspend the 
construction of unqualified projects which fail to suit the 
requirements of the state's industrial policies, which enjoy no 
financial backing, and which have unclear market prospects. In 
order to solve the housing problems of 40,000 urban dwellers who 
currently have a per capita housing area of only 4 square meters 
and below, the provincial government has decided to invest 500 
million yuan in the "living in contentment project" to speed up 
the construction of urban housing. 
  V. Accelerate Economic Structural Readjustment, and 
Nurture New Highly Adaptable Industries 
  The period from now to the end of this century is a vital 
period for Yunnan's economic development. We should step up the 
intensity of economic structural readjustment, vigorously seek 
and cultivate new growth points, give better play to comparative 
advantages, give form to new economic pillars, open and occupy 
more markets with our products, participate in international 
competition and exchanges, and expedite the process of realizing 
the second-step strategic goal. We should seize the current 
favorable opportunities, and, through readjusting the structure, 
bring up a number of highly adaptable industries which can 
promote the economic development of the whole province, and then 
turn them into continuous major financial resources. 
  The concept and focus of Yunnan's structural readjustment 
is: 
To act in accordance with market demands, rely on Yunnan's 
exceptional advantages in natural resources, cultivate new 
groups of highly adaptable industries across the province, and 
encourage thousands and thousands of households, especially 
those in poor areas, to become rich. During the process of 
readjusting the structure, we should give better play to 
Yunnan's advantages in cigarettes, sugar, and tea, especially in 
the "two tobaccos," and enable them to play a more important 
role in boosting Yunnan's economic construction in the 1990's. 
Meanwhile, we will give priority to cultivating and developing 
industries which are well-suited to Yunnan's advantages in 
natural resources, have good market prospects, and enjoy a solid 
foundation. We will, within this century, build Yunnan's food 
industry, nonferrous and ferrous metal industries, machinery and 
electronic industries, animal husbandry and processing industry, 
and power industry into newly emerged pillar industries which 
enjoy an output value of over 10 billion yuan, while turning the 
chemical industry, building materials industry, forestry and 
paper-making industry, and tourism industry into key industries 
with an output value exceeding 5 billion yuan. In addition, we 
will also develop a number of products with an output value of 
over 1 billion yuan, as well as industries and products which 
can earn $10 billion of foreign exchange through exports. All 
these steps will bring about a great improvement to Yunnan's 
comprehensive economic strength. 
  In our efforts to nurture new highly adaptable industries 
under the new structure, we must act in accordance with the 
requirement of building a socialist market economic structure, 
observe the laws of economic development, and make use of modern 
science and technology, as well as modern management results. 
We will step up efforts to formulate industrial organizational 
policies and organize production in line with the principles of 
economies of scale and with the requirements of specialization 
and socialization. It is important to give play to the role of 
science and technology as the primary productive force and to 
enable industries to enhance their ability to compete from a 
relatively high starting point. A highly efficient and flexible 
investment and financing structure will be set up so that 
enterprises and construction projects can quickly obtain the 
funds they need to support the development of pillar industries. 
Joint investment will be made by the central authorities, 
localities, and enterprises in a number of selected projects 
which enjoy a higher than expected investment return. We will 
continue to bring about simultaneous development to pluralistic 
new-type enterprise organizational forms, including the 
state-owned, collective, individual, private, foreign-invested, 
and shareholding sectors and will build up a number of major 
groups, large enterprises, and millions and millions of medium 
and small enterprises which can be found in both urban and rural 
areas. 
  VI. Further Expand Scale of Opening Up 
  The international and domestic situations at present are 
advantageous to our efforts to further expand the scale of 
opening to the outside world. We should firmly seize this rare 
opportunity, put forward more new ideas, open up more new paths, 
step up the intensity of opening up, and push Yunnan's opening 
up onto a new step. 
  While continuing to actively promote our economic and trade 
relations as well as friendly ties with more than 100 countries 
in the world, we will conscientiously apply the principles and 
policies of the central authorities on foreign-related work and 
put the focus of opening up on the southeast Asia region. In 
accordance with the good-neighbor policy, we will step up our 
contacts and make friends with more neighboring countries and 
bring about faster development to our economic and technological 
cooperation with these countries. It is necessary to bring into 
full play the roles of all democratic parties, associations on 
Taiwan and overseas Chinese affairs, and associations of 
industry and commerce in keeping contacts with overseas friends, 
the millions of our compatriots residing abroad, as well as the 
families of overseas Chinese, and to promote foreign- related 
propaganda and exchange and bring about greater development to 
Yunnan's opening up. 
  Efforts will be taken to actively arrange supplies of goods, 
and try hard to expand exports. We will further readjust the 
mix of exported commodities, continue to do a good job in 
exporting large-scale products, such as cigarettes, machinery, 
industrial chemicals, and nonferrous metals; actively expand 
exports of agricultural and sideline products, foodstuffs, and 
medicines; enhance the export proportion of products which enjoy 
higher added value and can earn more foreign exchange; and 
promptly give shape to a number of products which can earn over 
$100 million of foreign exchange from exports. We will 
encourage all localities to make use of their local resources to 
develop their own products which are oriented to international 
markets so that every county has its own commodities for export. 
It is important to improve the quality and grade of export 
commodities and to improve their packing, with a view to 
enhancing the credibility and competitiveness of exported 
commodities. Efforts will be taken to further expand exports of 
technological and labor services and to contract more projects 
in overseas areas. We will encourage and support qualified 
enterprises to set up factories in foreign countries. After the 
adoption of a uniform exchange rate, we will actively expand the 
scale of exports, support and encourage enterprises to introduce 
advanced technology and equipment from abroad, and accelerate 
the pace of technological transformation. 
  The rapid development of border trade will be maintained. To 
adapt ourselves to the new taxation system, we should work out 
new measures in order to bring about greater development to 
border trade. We should gear ourselves to the needs of both 
domestic and overseas markets, integrate producing industries 
with trade, promote the exploration of local resources, and give 
form to new industries. This year, the growth of Yunnan's border 
trade is estimated at over 20 percent. 
  Bold strides will be taken in the introduction of foreign 
investment. Over the past couple of years, Yunnan has attained 
certain results in introducing foreign investment; however, 
compared with other provinces and cities, we still fall far 
behind. This is mainly attributable to our failure to work with 
more open minds, as well as insufficient attention paid by some 
departments and localities to the numerous problems currently 
existing in management and related services concerning the 
introduction of foreign investment. Under such circumstances, 
we should further enhance the awareness of cadres at all levels 
on the need for opening up; mobilize all prefectures, autonomous 
prefectures, cities, counties, and all industries and trades to 
actively introduce foreign investment; and make particular 
headway in attracting major financial groups and companies to 
invest in our province. We will try every effort to improve the 
investment environment, enhance work efficiency, and seek timely 
solutions to problems cropped up during the introduction 
process. We will run well the existing 20 national and 
provincial-level development zones of various kinds and enable 
them to play a greater role in attracting foreign investment. 
It is imperative to put the focus of foreign investment 
introduction on the development of advantageous resources, on 
the construction of basic industries and infrastructure, on the 
development of exchange-earning agriculture and tourism, and on 
the grafting and transformation of state-owned large and medium 
enterprises. Through arduous efforts, we expect to use more 
than $340 million of foreign investment this year. 
  With the approval of the PRC Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations and Trade, the Kunming Export Commodities Fair has 
become one of China's regional fairs for export commodities. We 
are determined to make this year's fair a success. 
  Vigorous efforts will be made to promote the tourism 
industry. Yunnan's tourism industry is enjoying a good 
development momentum. With the improvement of transportation 
facilities and the completion of eight local airports, Yunnan 
has stepped up its contacts with all countries in the world, 
especially neighboring countries, and its tourism industry faces 
unprecedentedly favorable opportunities for further development. 
While continuing to pay close attention to the construction of 
auxiliary facilities at tourist spots, including Kunming and 
Xishuangbanna, we will place tourism in a primary position and 
speed up the pace of development of tourism areas in 
northwestern Yunnan. It is imperative to actively open up 
tourist markets and vigorously develop the production of tourist 
commodities to enhance the economic efficiency of our province 
as a whole. Further efforts will be taken to strengthen 
macroeconomic management, enhance the quality of services, 
perfect the responsibility system at all levels, and bring 
faster development to Yunnan's tourism industry. This year, we 
will strive to attract more than 13 million domestic tourists 
and 480,000 overseas tourists to Yunnan, earn more foreign 
exchange from tourism, and bring about comprehensive development 
to tertiary industries. 
  It is important to actively promote lateral economic ties 
and 
cooperation with other parts of the country. We will 
conscientiously carry out projects adopted at the 10th session 
of the economic coordination meeting which was held by seven 
sides in five provinces and regions, thus bringing about 
comprehensive development to regional economic cooperation. 
Meanwhile, we will actively cooperate with fraternal provinces 
and cities, especial those in coastal areas. We will try hard 
to develop hydroelectric resources in cooperation with Guangdong 
and will engage ourselves in the joint development of oil 
refining and processing bases and other major projects with 
Guangxi and other provinces and regions. 
<H5>  VII. Continue to Attach Importance to Accelerate the </H5>
Economic Development of Ethnic Minority Regions and Poor Areas 
  We must attach great importance to the economic development 
of ethnic minority regions and poor areas, as this has a direct 
bearing on Yunnan's efforts to realize the second-step strategic 
goal, and also on unity among different nationalities and social 
stability in border areas. The provincial government will 
continue to conscientiously implement the "Law on Regional 
Autonomy of Minority Nationalities," and put into practice all 
policies which aim to support the economic and social 
development of ethnic minority regions and poor areas. It is 
imperative to constantly perfect the comprehensive operational 
structure formed by integration between the urban and rural 
areas, between science and technology and the economy, between 
opening up and development, and between agriculture, industry, 
and commerce, with a view to attain the rapid development of 
production. According to the new standards set by the state, 
there are about 7 million people in our province whose per 
capita net income is less than 300 yuan. The provincial 
government has decided to raise 7 billion yuan within the next 
seven years before 2000 to basically solve the problem of 
insufficient food and clothing for 7 million people. We will 
mainly adopt the method of comprehensive regional development, 
and will closely integrate aid-the-poor work with the 
construction of the former war zone, the comprehensive 
exploration of agriculture, and with the development of border 
economic belts and mountain areas to attain common development 
with unifying force. We will focus our efforts on work in the 
following fields: 
  First, we will make a success of comprehensive regional 
development. The provincial government has already studied 
local development programs with a number of prefectures and 
autonomous prefectures and will continue to help several 
prefectures and autonomous prefectures to work out plans on ways 
to extricate themselves from poverty this year. While doing a 
good job in the comprehensive development of areas inhabited by 
minority nationalities, as well as in the large-scale 
development of mountain areas, we will attach importance to 
helping multinational areas and scattered poor households 
extricate themselves from poverty. As regards infrastructural 
construction and resource development in these areas, we will 
try to do a better job in launching projects to provide jobs by 
way of relief and will give priority to a number of projects 
concerning farmland, water conservancy, energy, and 
transportation, thus bringing along the economic development of 
these areas. 
  Second, we will try every effort to optimize the industrial 
structure. We will pay close attention to the construction of 
farmland with stable and high yields, spread the use of applied 
agrotechniques, and support the development of a diversified 
economy. Vigorous efforts will be taken to develop township and 
town enterprises as well as industries and sideline production 
on the basis of households, guide surplus labor to shift toward 
the secondary and tertiary industries, and export labor services 
to advanced areas. During the process of optimizing the 
industrial structure, we will pay attention to suiting measures 
to local conditions, gearing ourselves to the needs of the 
market, and trying hard to develop our own pillar industries and 
highly competitive products. 
  Third, we will boldly give the individual and private 
economies a free hand in development. It is necessary to adhere 
to the principle of relying mainly on public ownership while 
bringing common development to multi economic elements and 
gradually raising the proportion of nonpublic-owned economies 
throughout the national economy. We will guide thousands upon 
thousands of households to proceed from local resources and the 
demands of the market; engage themselves in crop farming, 
livestock breeding, and processing and service industries; and 
support the development of tertiary industries, including 
commerce and trade, tourism, communications, education, 
technology, labor services, and rural socialized services. We 
will encourage individual industrial and commercial households 
as well as private enterprises to contract, lease, merge, and 
purchase small state-owned and collective enterprises. 
  Fourth, it is imperative to gradually set up a perfect new 
operational mechanism for aid-the-poor work. To successfully 
aid the poor and help them develop, we should integrate the 
behavior of the government with that of society and enterprises, 
set up pluralistic fund-raising channels and patterns, and 
attract funds from society and make use of foreign investment in 
an extensive way. We will actively put the shareholding system 
and the project responsibility system in newly started projects 
into practice and will strengthen assisting the poor through the 
application of science and technology, so that the level of 
overall economic and social development of ethnic minority 
regions and poor areas can be enhanced on a constant basis. 
  Fifth, we will continue to take supportive measures. The 
state and provincial authorities will continue to increase their 
inputs to aid-the-poor funds in poverty-stricken areas; 
meanwhile, increases will also be registered in other 
specialized aid-the-poor funds. 
  VIII. Make Adequate Arrangements for the Daily Lives 
of the People 
  This year, under the situation of comprehensively pushing 
forward all reforms, we should attach greater importance to 
making adequate arrangements for the daily lives of the people 
and strive to enhance the general living standards of the masses 
on the basis of economic growth. Salary reform has brought 
improvements to the previous situation where state workers had 
unduly low incomes. As a result of improved agricultural 
production and the development of township and town enterprises, 
as well as tertiary industries, and increases in purchasing 
prices for grain, peasants' incomes are on the rise. Enterprise 
workers and administrative staff also earn more because their 
enterprises have improved production and enhanced work 
efficiency. While trying hard to increase the income of the 
masses, governments at all levels should pay special attention 
to the lives of the masses in disaster-stricken areas, workers 
and staff in enterprises which have suspended their operations 
entirely or partially, and retired personnel with low incomes, 
and should help them tide over real difficulties in their lives. 
We will actively push forward reform of the social guarantee 
system and will pay close attention to establishing and 
perfecting basic insurance systems which have a bearing on the 
life of the people, such as endowment insurance for workers and 
staff. 
  Price reform is directly related to the improvement of the 
people's livelihood and also to maintaining stability in 
society, therefore, we need to push forward price reform in a 
steady way. Last year, commodity prices rose by a large margin. 
To counter such a situation, we should place the work of 
controlling price rises in a primary position, strengthen 
leadership and make careful arrangements, and strive to make 
commodity prices maintain stability. To this end: 1) we should 
make careful arrangements for carrying out price readjustments 
set by the state, and Yunnan will not take advantage of this 
opportunity by adopting measures to raise commodity prices and 
service charges. 2) We will conduct key inspections on prices 
and charges of major commodities which are closely related to 
the lives of the masses and will firmly abolish irrational 
charges. 3) We will strengthen supervision and inspections, 
ban the production and sale of sham and shoddy commodities, put 
an end to price pushing and runaway price rises, and protect the 
interests and rights of consumers. 
  Commodity circulation is closely bound up with the 
livelihood 
of the people, and stabilizing the market is of great importance 
to setting the people's minds at ease. Governments at all 
levels should make the "rice bag" and "shopping basket" projects 
an important item on their agenda; successfully organize the 
purchase, allocation, transportation, and sale of major means of 
livelihood, including grain, cooking oil, vegetables, meat, and 
eggs; and strive to prevent of sensitive market commodities from 
running out of stock. Meanwhile, we will set up funds for 
market regulation and a reserve system for major commodities 
with a view to enhancing our ability to exercise control and 
regulation. Efforts will be taken to give play to the role of 
state circulation cooperatives in regulating supply and demand, 
stabilizing the market, and setting up and perfecting the 
regulation mechanism. 
  Family planning and environmental protection are two 
important tasks for governments at all levels for they have a 
direct bearing on the enhancement of the living standards of the 
people. We should conscientiously observe the central 
authorities' requirement of "paying close attention to and 
making a success of family planning"; persistently implement the 
principle of "relying mainly on propaganda and education, on 
contraception and birth control, and on routine work"; and 
successfully carry out family planning in a down-to-earth 
manner. We will continue to take effective measures and focus 
our attention on family planning work in areas with a weak 
foundation and a high birth rate, as well as on the floating 
population. We will further improve service organs, build up 35 
county-level and 200 township-level family planning service 
stations, and strive to attain new results this year in 
controlling the total population and in enhancing quality. It 
is important to bring environmental protection into our economic 
and social development program, and comprehensively improve the 
environment in both urban and rural areas. We will correctly 
handle the relationship between development and protection and 
strictly ban practices that eventually destroy forests and upset 
the ecological balance. While designing new enterprises and 
transforming the old, we must also take measures to prevent 
pollution. We will attach great importance to water and soil 
conservation, accelerate the pace of afforestation, 
conscientiously carry out "long-term prevention" and "long-term 
harnessing" projects on the Jinsha Jiang, and start to harness 
drainage areas on a small scale. The harnessing of Tianchi is 
already underway, and we must speed up the pace of construction 
and strive for quick results. 
  IX. Expedite Development of Education, Science and 
Technology, and Other Social Undertakings 
  In the process of building a socialist market economic 
structure and carrying out the drive for modernization, we must 
always put the development of education and scientific and 
technological progress in a primary strategic position. Through 
deepening reform, we need to further enhance the awareness of 
the need to promote education and science and technology, 
mobilize the enthusiasm of all sides, and bring about greater 
development to Yunnan's education, science and technology, and 
other social undertakings. 
  In promoting education, we are faced with the following 
major 
tasks this year: We should conscientiously implement the 
"Outline on China's Educational Reform and Development," further 
improve the multi-channel structure of raising educational funds 
which relies mainly on state financial allocations, grant 
greater autonomy to schools in their operations, and gradually 
set up a new operational mechanism for education which suits the 
needs of the socialist market economy. To strengthen elementary 
education, provincial financial departments will raise another 
50 million yuan to help 63 poor border ethnic minority counties 
improve their school-running conditions. Efforts will be made 
to make nine-year compulsory education basically universal in 10 
more counties (cities) and six-year compulsory education in 30 
counties (cities). A total of 280,000 illiterate people have 
learned to read and write, and we will make every effort to 
basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged 
people in 12 to 15 counties. It is important to mobilize the 
enthusiasm of all departments, enterprises and administrative 
organs, and all walks of life, thus creating a new situation in 
which the whole society is engaged in providing vocational and 
technical education through various forms and at different 
levels. Vigorous efforts will be taken to gear vocational and 
technical education to the demands of the market, adapt it to 
the needs of local economic development, take the road of 
integrating production with education and enterprises with 
schools, and bring up large numbers of qualified personnel for 
the economic structural readjustment and for the cultivation of 
new advantageous industries. In carrying out adult education, 
we should act in accordance with the principle of studying for 
the purpose of application and emphasizing practical results, 
focus efforts on on-the-job training and continued education, 
and attach importance to the knowledge renewal of people in 
employment. To boost higher education, we will take the road of 
relying mainly on intensive development, continue to optimize 
the structure, and enhance the quality of teaching and the 
efficiency of school administration on a constant basis. We 
will make every effort to enable Yunnan University to rank among 
China's 100 key institutions of higher learning, and, meanwhile, 
speed up preparations for the establishment of the Yunnan 
Industrial University. We will conscientiously implement the 
"Law on Teachers" and further improve the working, studying, and 
living conditions of teachers. 
  Efforts will be taken to deepen reform of the scientific and 
technological structure, with a view to gradually establishing a 
new-type structure which suits the needs of the socialist market 
economy, conforms to the development laws of science and 
technology, and closely integrates science and technology with 
the economy. We will readjust the structure of scientific 
research institutions in line with the principle of 
"concentrating on scientific and technological research and at 
the same time encouraging the commercialization of research 
results," accelerate the pace of assigning scientific and 
technological personnel to their special fields of study, 
successfully carry out experiments with the scientific and 
technological structural reform in seven scientific research 
institutions and in the city of Dali, and start experiments with 
the shareholding system and shareholding cooperative system in 
several selected scientific and technological enterprises. 
Vigorous efforts will be taken to push into the market those 
scientific research institutions which are engaged in 
technological development and services and optimize the internal 
organization of scientific research institutions. It is 
important to encourage enterprises to attain technological 
progress to turn these enterprises into the main body of 
technological development. We will continue to do a good job in 
building the scientific and technological service system in line 
with the structural readjustment of agriculture, so that the 
system can play its due role in boosting agriculture featured by 
"two highs and one excellent." We will actively guide 
county-run enterprises as well as township and town enterprises 
to improve their economic efficiency, as well as the quality and 
competitiveness of their products, through the application of 
scientific and technological results. It is necessary to 
organize scientific and technological forces of all sides to 
tackle key problems in scientific research, thus providing a 
technological backing for the development of advantageous 
resources as well as for economic growth. Further efforts will 
be made to develop the technology market and gradually set up a 
technological market system in central cities which relies on 
the permanent technology market and is well connected to other 
domestic markets, as well as international markets. We will 
actively develop urban and rural nongovernmental scientific and 
technological enterprises in the fields of resource development, 
energy conservation, environmental protection, new materials, 
and biotechnology. It is imperative to continuously accelerate 
the construction of 10 key laboratories and 6 intermediate-level 
experimental bases in Yunnan and to pay close attention to 
bringing up 200 leading academic figures in different branches 
of learning. Social scientific research should be focused on 
new situations cropping up during the process of establishing a 
market economic structure and on research on major subjects, 
thus providing services for reform, opening up, and economic 
development. We should protect intellectual property right 
according to the law, respect knowledge, and treasure able 
personnel so that they can fully display their talents on the 
main battlefield of economic construction. 
  Public health should undergo vigorous development. We will 
apply the principle of "relying mainly on prevention of 
diseases," improve hygiene conditions in rural areas in real 
terms, and successfully fulfill the task of providing elementary 
medical care in rural areas. Close attention should be paid to 
the prevention and cure of epidemic diseases of all kinds, while 
keeping an effective control over the sudden occurrence and 
spread of all diseases. We will make full use of Yunnan's 
advantage in medical resources, cultivate our own pharmaceutical 
industry, and bring about further developments in traditional 
Chinese medicine. It is imperative to actively push forward 
reform of the urban medical care system and gradually set up a 
social medical insurance system which tallies with the actual 
conditions of our province. 
  Vigorous efforts will be made to promote sports, put into 
practice the plan of "an entire nation in good health," carry 
out mass sports of various kinds on an extensive scale, and 
constantly improve the physical condition of the masses of the 
people. Good preparations should be made for the Fifth National 
Meet. We will continue to pay close attention to athletic 
sports and strive to attain good results again in major domestic 
and international competitions. 
<H5>  X. Strengthen the Building of Spiritual Civilization, </H5>
Democracy, and the Legal System, Creating a Sound Social 
Environment for Reform and Opening Up 
  It is our basic principle to "pay simultaneous attention to 
two types of work, attaching equal importance to both." The 
more we deepen reform and accelerate development, the more we 
need to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization, 
democracy, and the legal system; maintain the stability of 
border areas; and make reform, development, and stability 
complementary to each other. 
  To successfully carry out the building of spiritual 
civilization, what counts is arming ourselves and acting in line 
with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. At present, we must conscientiously 
study the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"; 
fully understand the great role of spiritual civilization 
building in providing reform, opening up, and development with a 
spiritual motive force, intelligence support, ideological 
guarantees and a sound environment of social opinions; and take 
concerted efforts to enhance Yunnan's building of spiritual 
civilizations onto a new level. To realize the goal of bringing 
up well-educated and well-disciplined socialist new people who 
have high ideals and ethical standards, we need to carry out 
in-depth education on the party's basic line, as well as on 
patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; carry forward the 
traditional virtues of the Chinese nation; and inspire the 
spirit and enhance the morale of the people. We will carry out 
activities to emulate the heroic soldier, Xu Honggang, on an 
extensive scale and will cultivate sound general practices in 
society. It is important to pay close attention to the 
education of young people and children and guide them to 
establish the correct outlook on life, value, and morality. We 
must have a clear-cut stand in opposing money worship, hedonism, 
ultra-individualism, and decadent lifestyles; absolutely 
eliminate all kinds of social evils; and try hard to give rise 
to a sound general social environment which encourages healthy 
trends and checks unhealthy ones. 
  Conscientious attention should be paid to the development of 
cultural undertakings. It is imperative to deepen reform of the 
cultural structure and to explore ways to establish an 
operational mechanism which is full of vitality. We will adhere 
to the principle of "serving the people and the cause of 
socialism" and of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a 
hundred schools of thought contend"; encourage those engaged in 
the theoretical circles, literature and art, and the press and 
publishing to immerse themselves among the masses, plunge into 
the thick of life, create healthy works which eulogize reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive and which sing the 
praises of the main melody of the spirit of our times; try hard 
to occupy the front line of ideology and public opinion with 
literature and art products of good taste; make the cultural 
market flourish; and enrich the spiritual lives of the people. 
We will provide our people with correct opinion guides; enhance 
the propaganda quality of radio, films, television, and 
newspapers; and expand the coverage of radio and television 
reception. The provincial government has decided to build 
another batch of satellite relay stations so that the masses 
residing in remote mountain areas can also enjoy television 
programs. We will actively carry out the activity of creating 
advanced cultural counties and will pay continued attention to 
the consolidation and development of township and town cultural 
stations (centers) as well as to the creation of literature and 
art works. We will successfully protect historical and cultural 
relics and accelerate the construction of the Yunnan Nationality 
Museum. Greater headway will be made this year in building the 
1,000-li border cultural corridor. Efforts will be taken to 
strengthen the management of newspapers and publications, films 
and television, audio visual products, and the entertainment 
sector, with the aim of bringing about healthy development in 
the cultural market. 
  Earnest efforts must be taken to strengthen the building of 
socialist democracy and the legal system. The provincial 
government and its affiliated departments must conscientiously 
carry out decisions and resolutions adopted by the provincial 
people's congress and its standing committee, extensively 
solicit the opinions of people's deputies and accept their 
suggestions, and voluntarily subject themselves to the legal and 
routine supervision of the provincial people's congress and its 
standing committee. We will tighten ties with the provincial 
committee of the CPPCC, all democratic parties, and non-party 
personages and will fully consult with them before the 
provincial government makes major policy decisions. Attention 
will be paid to maintaining close ties between the government 
and the people, handle well letters and visits from the masses, 
and quickly comprehend the opinions and requirements of the 
masses on the government's work. With the goal of setting up a 
local legal system which suits Yunnan's reform, construction, 
and development, we will comprehensively implement the "Decision 
of the State Council on Strengthening Legal Work of the 
Government;" focus our attention on standardizing the main body 
of the market, maintaining market order, strengthening 
macroeconomic control and regulation, improving the social 
guarantee system, promoting opening up, and successfully 
building a clean administration; and speed up the pace of 
economic legislation, especially local legislation. This year, 
we will pay close attention to the drafting and formulation of a 
number of local laws, rules, and regulations which have a direct 
bearing on the socialist economy and other aspects. It is 
important to administer the government according to law, 
reinforce administrative law enforcement and legal supervision, 
and promptly get rid of, amend, and abolish those rules, 
regulations, and standardized documents which can no longer meet 
the requirements of reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  We will implement the party's nationality policy in a 
comprehensive way, correctly put into practice policies on 
religion, strengthen unity among different nationalities, 
mobilize the enthusiasm of all sides, and encourage people of 
all nationalities to make contributions to the socialist 
modernization drive. 
  Maintaining social stability is a basic condition for 
pushing 
forward reform, opening up, and economic development. 
Rectification of public security is a system project which 
requires the efforts of the entire society; therefore, measures 
will be taken to improve all facets of public security, thus 
giving rise to a situation where the entire society sets out to 
improve public security with concerted efforts. We will 
persistently carry out the principle of "cracking down on 
crime," concentrate our energy on investigating major criminal 
cases that severely undermine social order and endanger people's 
lives or property, and crack criminal rings and promptly hand 
down severe punishment to criminals according to the law. 
Continued efforts will be taken to carry out special-purpose 
struggles, mainly the anti-drug campaign; crack down on highway 
and railway robberies; and eliminate such social evil phenomena 
as prostitution, mass gambling, and the abduction and sale of 
women and children. We will implement a management 
responsibility system with specific targets for public security 
rectification at different levels, correctly handle 
contradictions of two different types, and seek timely solutions 
to all problems which may undermine social stability. To 
strengthen the work of public security and judicial organs, the 
provincial government has decided to increase its input to 
ensure necessary expenses, gradually improve working conditions, 
and enhance the quality and equipment of Yunnan's 
law-enforcement to a new level. 
<H5>  XI. Change Functions of Government, and Succeed in </H5>
Institutional Reform 
  Changing the functions and reforming the organizational 
structure of government is an urgent need for the establishment 
of the socialist market economic structure. Governments at all 
levels should persistently separate their functions from those 
of enterprises, allow enterprises to make their own operational 
decisions, and allow intermediary organizations to handle 
whatever they are capable of handling. The main function of the 
government is to reinforce macroeconomic control and regulation, 
intensify auditing and economic supervision, and provide 
coordination services and social management. 
  One prerequisite for changing the functions of government is 
to simplify government structures. In accordance with a plan on 
readjusting the structural establishment, which was submitted to 
the first session of the 8th provincial people's congress by the 
provincial government and later examined and approved by the 
State Council, certain changes have been made to the structural 
establishment of our province; as a result, there are now 37 
work organs, five directly affiliated organs, and two offices 
under the provincial government, thus reducing the total number 
from 62 to 44, down 29 percent. Institutional reform, the 
merger of work organs, and reductions in provincial government 
staff are expected to be completed in the first half of this 
year. Prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and city governments 
are required to start experiments with institutional reform in 
the first half of this year, unfold the work in a comprehensive 
way in the latter half of the year, and complete the work in the 
first half of next year. We will strive to fulfill 
institutional reform in county-level organs in the first half of 
next year. On the basis of institutional reform, we will 
gradually put into practice a civil service system and allow the 
system to function normally within the next three years. 
  XII. Carry Out in Depth the Campaign To Combat 
Corruption and Advocate a Clean Administration, Earnestly 
Improve Work of the Government 
  To adapt ourselves to the new situation of reform, opening 
up, and the modernization drive, we must keep government 
employees honest and industrious and carry out the struggle 
against corruption in a thorough way. This is a basic task for 
power building, and also an important guarantee for the smooth 
progress of reform and development. We should fully understand 
that the anti-graft struggle is a protracted and arduous one; 
therefore, we must pay unremitting attention to such matters of 
life and death for our nation and live up to the expectations of 
the people of all nationalities across the province. Government 
functionaries at all levels should bear in mind that the power 
in their hands is given by the people and that the abuse of that 
power for personal gain is absolutely impermissible. Neither 
can anyone apply the principle of commodity exchange to the 
activities of government institutions, or carry out power and 
money deals. All government functionaries should be honest and 
clean when carrying out their official duties, observe laws and 
discipline, and serve the people wholeheartedly. In accordance 
with the arrangements of the central authorities, we will 
continue to investigate major cases of graft and corruption, 
dereliction of duty, and smuggling, hand down severe punishment 
to corrupt elements, and put an absolute end to unhealthy 
practices which the masses resent most. Efforts will be taken 
to build a system of clean administration and establish an 
effective supervision and constraints mechanism so that we can 
prevent and eliminate decadent phenomena in systemic terms. 
  Earnest efforts will also be taken to improve the work of 
the 
government. Government functionaries, especially leading 
cadres, should conscientiously study the third volume of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"; arm their minds and carry out 
their work in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics; constantly 
enhance their Marxist theoretical level; pay close attention to 
learning about the socialist market economy; make good use of 
the state's major plans policies, rules, and regulations on 
reform; and enhance their leadership skills and ability to 
manage economic construction under the new situation. We must 
further change our style of work; firmly overcome bureaucracy, 
formalism, and departmental selfishness; go down to grass-roots 
units to acquaint ourselves with practical conditions; carry out 
investigations and research and learn public feelings through 
personal experience; and accomplish more solid work for the 
interest of units and the masses at the grass-roots level. 
  The People's Liberation Army is a defender of our great 
motherland and a constructor of the socialist modernization 
drive. Governments at all levels as well as the people of all 
nationalities across the province should concern themselves with 
and support the building of our troops, further strengthen unity 
between the Army and the government and between the Army and the 
people, and constantly enhance the fish-and-water ties between 
the masses of the people and the Army. We should successfully 
carry out education on national defense, enhance the awareness 
of the whole people of the need for national defense, strengthen 
the work of the militia and reserve services, extensively carry 
out the activity of supporting the Army and giving preferential 
treatment to the families of revolutionary servicemen and 
martyrs, and do a good job in the resettlement of demobilized 
soldiers as well as armymen transferred to civilian work. We 
will work side by side with the Chinese People's Liberation Army 
and will successfully safeguard national security, consolidate 
border defense, and maintain social stability. 
  Fellow Deputies: 
  Yunnan is faced with glorious and arduous tasks in reform, 
opening up, and development in 1994. We must rally closely all 
the more around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as its core, and under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and under the leadership of the Yunnan 
Provincial CPC Committee, take concerted efforts, forge ahead, 
carry out hard struggles, open up new paths, and strive to build 
up a new socialist market economic structure and fulfill this 
year's tasks of economic and social development!

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Ping (1728 5393): "Implement the Major </F>
Instructions Given by Zhu Rongji and the Problems Resolved by 
Him During His Inspection Tour of Heilongjiang"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 27 April, the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government held a meeting of 
principal responsible persons of pertinent provincial-level 
departments to research how to implement the major instructions 
given by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and the several major problems 
resolved by him during his inspection tour of Heilongjiang with 
a view to promoting the province's reform, development, and 
stability. 
  Provincial leaders Tian Fengshan, Ma Guoliang, Cong Fukui, 
and Yang Zhihai attended the meeting and made speeches. 
  Pertinent departments of the provincial party committee and 
the provincial government have done a lot of painstaking work as 
quickly as possible and assigned, through rapid arrangement and 
research, the tasks of implementing the problems resolved by the 
state for the province. 
  Tian Fengshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, pointed out at the meeting: The whole province 
should reach a common understanding in regarding Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji's major instructions and the problems resolved by him 
during this inspection tour of Heilongjiang as a major 
transition and opportunity for the province's reform, opening 
up, and economic development. Since the beginning of this year, 
leaders of the party and the state have listened to the reports 
on the province's reform and development situation delivered by 
the provincial party committee and the provincial government. 
Entrusted by comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji personally led responsible comrades of pertinent 
ministries and commissions of the state Heilongjiang Province to 
conduct investigations and help the province tackle a series of 
difficulties and problems. From the inspection tour itself and 
from the problems resolved by central leaders for the province, 
we can catch sight of the great concern over Heilongjiang by the 
CPC Central Committee and the State Council, which will produce 
great influence on the province's production and development. 
Therefore, successfully implementing the important instructions 
given by Zhu Rongji and other central leading comrades and the 
major problems resolved by them for the province is by no means 
an ordinary work, but is really a great event of the province as 
a whole. These instructions will provide the province with an 
opportunity to accelerate development and will effect a major 
transition in our work. 
  Tian Fengshan said: In implementing the important 
instructions given by central leading comrades and the problems 
resolved by them, the most important thing is to bring the 
province's work into line with the general pattern of the whole 
country and to accelerate the development of Heilongjiang in the 
course of continuously making contributions to the country. In 
doing research for the province's agricultural development, 
Comrade Zhu Rongji pointed out: "Heilongjiang is the largest 
grain base and a grain reserve base of a strategic significance 
in China. To feed Chinese people, we should depend on 
Heilongjiang." "There are at least 50 million mu of undeveloped 
land that can be reclaimed and 80 million mu of low-yield 
farmland that can be transformed." "If we invest 10 billion 
yuan in Heilongjiang, we can take 200,000 tonnes of soybean and 
several hundred thousand tonnes of corn every year, equal to an 
output value of some 10 billion yuan. With this, we can tackle 
eating problems for our descendants." All these aspirations and 
demands have been set forth from a strategic high plane of 
overall interest. Comrade Zhu Rongji also talked about the 
issues concerning the development of Daqing, concerning the 
rapid renovation of old industrial bases and the invigoration of 
large and medium-sized enterprises, concerning the expansion of 
opening up, foreign trade, and economic and technological 
cooperation, and concerning vigorous development of township and 
town enterprises. All these aspirations and demands have been 
set forth from the high plane of the overall interest and from 
the general economic pattern of the whole country. We should 
attend to these issues by proceeding from the overall situation 
of the country. In particular, it is a huge project to reclaim 
the 50 million mu of undeveloped land and to transform the 80 
million mu of low-yield farmland. We should exert great efforts 
in this project and conscientiously plan, appraise, and carry it 
out. Achieving success in this project, we will not only make 
contributions to the state but also develop ourselves through 
the contributions. So is the case in other fields. 
  Tian Fengshan pointed out: The most fundamental work for 
implementing the guidelines of the instructions on 
Heilongjiang's work given by Zhu Rongji and other central 
leading comrades and the important issues they have resolved is 
to further clarify our ideas for reform, development, and 
stability. On many occasions, Zhu Rongji talked about the 
"desire to probe more ideas for addressing the issues on 
Heilongjiang's development, reform, and stability." He also 
said: "It will not work for us to come here to spend a lot of 
money. Spending money cannot solve problems. We should explore 
an idea and unify thinking to solve problems." Concluding his 
inspection tour, he said that Heilongjiang should unify 
understanding of four issues. This actually indicated the 
direction of our future work. We should acquire a profound 
understanding of it and study and implement it in line with 
reality. 
  Tian Fengshan pointed out: The most crucial point in 
implementing the guidelines of the instructions on 
Heilongjiang's work given by Zhu Rongji and other central 
leading comrades and the important issues they have resolved is 
to base ourselves and focus on our specific conditions. The 
party Central Committee and the State Council have attached 
great importance to Heilongjiang's development, understood our 
difficulties, and helped us address specific issues. They 
resolved not only extremely urgent issues but also issues on 
long-term development; resolved not only the key issues on 
industries but also issues on trades; and not only resolved 
issues on funds and projects but also provided policies. This 
will not only help us overcome the current difficulties and 
maintain provincewide economic and social stability but also 
help promote Heilongjiang's development. More importantly, it 
will play an important role in heightening our spirit and in 
helping us overcome difficulties, unify thinking, enhance our 
confidence, unite as one, and make Heilongjiang's work 
successful. It should be noted that the central authorities 
have indeed helped Heilongjiang address many issues, but it is 
our own efforts we should rely on to ultimately solve problems 
and achieve development. We must enhance the sense of urgency 
and responsibility and seize the favorable opportunity provided 
by Vice Premier Zhu's inspection in our province to 
conscientiously work to promote Heilongjiang's economic and 
social development. 
  Tian Fengshan emphasized: We should establish and institute 
the strict responsibility system characterized by division of 
work among leaders, pay close attention to implementation of the 
responsibilities, and achieve real good results. After several 
days of work, we have sorted out our problems and roughly 
divided them into three categories. In the first category are 
the issues the state have explicitly agreed to resolve totally 
or partly or those it has the intention to resolve. Whether 
these issues can be resolved is the key to whether we can seize 
the opportunity and achieve the greatest results. Particularly 
regarding the issues toward which principles and attitude have 
been provided but specific and clear guidance is still lacking, 
we should exert efforts to make these issued resolved to the 
maximum. In the second category are issues that the state 
agreed to further study and coordinate efforts to resolve or 
those which cannot be resolved for the time being due to lack of 
necessary conditions and should be considered in the future. 
Regarding these issues, we should submit reports to strive for 
their resolution. Our reports should be based on reason and 
just grounds and should be accurate, and we should do this work 
faster and include these issues in the issues to be resolved by 
Vice Premier Zhu Rongji so as to make our work easier. In the 
third category are the opinions and demands we put forward which 
the various ministries and commissions of the state did not 
agree or toward which they have yet to take a stand. If, in 
this category, there are issues conducive to Heilongjiang's 
development and also not harmful to the overall interests, we 
should strive for state assistance to resolve them. In 
particular, we must never give up the issues which the 
ministries and commissions said would decide depending on the 
situation in the second half of this year or in the future. 
  We should foster confidence, approach from a long-term 
point of view, and do solid work to enjoy the support of the 
state. Although some of the problems have not been mentioned in 
our reports except for the problems of these three categories, 
the departments concerned should pay full attention to the 
petroleum, coal, grain, war, forest industries' problems in 
deepening reform, reducing the staff, improving efficiency, and 
developing the tertiary industry as well as the problems 
relating to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline 
occupation, and fishery, as set forth by Vice Premier Zhu and 
the state ministry and committee leaders; and strive to make 
achievements in solving these problems through investigations 
and study, coordination, and proof. 
  Tian Fengshan pointed out: It is necessary to persist in the 
principle that whoever is in charge should assume 
responsibility. The leading cadres at various levels must 
personally organize forces to engage in the work assigned to 
them, personally "run around to departments," and specifically 
and meticulously fulfill their work. On no account must the 
activities of not putting the work in place, not assuming 
responsibility, shifting responsibility onto others, and even 
practicing bureaucracy bring about losses to work. We should 
concentrate time and energy and go all out to grasp our work. We 
should be sure to create conditions if there are no conditions 
and to be good at using conditions if there are any. Work must 
not, in the slightest degree, be put off. All fronts should 
make concerted efforts and positively work in coordination with 
one another. As for the problems relating to two or more 
departments , all departments should exchange views with one 
another and go into action in a coordinate manner. 
Provincial-level leaders and responsible comrades of relevant 
departments should take command in solving the problems if the 
situation needs. What we should particularly stress is that no 
departments are allowed to substitute the departmental interests 
for the interests of the whole or to shift responsibilities onto 
others. We should carry out the work perseveringly through to 
the end; strive to make achievements; ensure that there must be 
assured sources, results, and echoes of handling problems; and 
not give up halfway. 
  In regard to the province's tasks in 1994, Tian Fengshan 
stressed: Persistently focusing the overall economic work on 
increasing economic results is not only an urgent ask at present 
but also a long-term strategic task. We must rely on not only 
the improvement of the macroeconomic environment but also the 
enterprises' efforts to strengthen the microeconomy. Therefore, 
persistently on the basis of the existing effective methods, the 
province as a whole should adopt all realistic measures to 
improve economic results. At the beginning of the year, the 
province made arrangements for industrial production. We should 
continue to grasp the implementation of the arrangements. So 
far, two aspects must be stressed. One is to create external 
environments for enterprises and to give them more assistance. 
The other is to positively guide the enterprises to turn their 
eyes inward, build up their internal strength, and concentrate 
more energy on reform, transformation, and management. In 
regard to agriculture, we should comprehensively grasp 
agriculture and the rural work in line with the idea of large- 
scale agriculture and lay particular stress on tightening up 
fists to grasp spring sowing. The most realistic measure for 
increasing production is to do farm work in the right season. 
The most important task at present is to grasp spring sowing. 
We will gain the initiative in doing the work of the whole year 
when we win a victory in this battle. Therefore, the people 
from higher levels downward, particularly relevant departments 
and all prefectures, counties, and townships, should concentrate 
this period of time to grasp spring sowing and go to the 
forefront of spring sowing to conduct investigations and study, 
grasp the situation, and solve problems. Of course, the 
arrangements and distributions of the leadership forces and work 
forces should be scientific and reasonable. In particular, we 
should make a unified arrangement for developing town and 
township enterprises and the county-level economy and positively 
promote their development. Although greater achievements have 
been made in the past years, we are still confronted with big 
difficulties. We should exert efforts to grasp the study of 
countermeasures and explore new cooperation forms and 
cooperation spheres. 
  A prominent issue at present is to 
concentrate efforts on making well prepared for the fifth Harbin 
border trade and local economic talks. The province as a whole 
should regard the talks as a motive force in improving the 
foreign economic and trade work to a new level. In commodity 
circulation, we should organize the sources of goods in a 
down-to-earth manner; ensure goods supply for festive periods; 
stabilize the markets; make things convenient for the mass; and 
make the economy prosperous. Efforts should be made to 
accelerate and push forward the reform in the circulation field. 
It is particularly necessary to continuously concentrate 
efforts on having state-owned commercial and service 
enterprises, enterprises owned by the state but run by 
individuals, and wholesale enterprises change their track and 
style so as to enable the circulation field to further become 
brisk. As for security and fire prevention work, various 
localities and departments should attach great importance on 
them; strictly enforce the responsibility system; implement the 
measures of being on guard; and realistically do a good job in 
preventing fires among forest zones, urban areas, and coal mines 
as well as in stressing safe production chiefly among 
construction and installation enterprises. 
  Tian Fengshan emphatically pointed out in concluding his 
speech: A good job should be further done in the work of keeping 
stable. Maintaining the stability represents an important 
content of creating a whole situation in the work undertaken by 
the entire party this year. Without political stability and 
social peace, we are in no position to carry out reform, opening 
up, and development. First, we should emphatically do a good job 
in dealing with the hot problems for which the masses have shown 
concern. In line with the demand set by the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, we should make unified arrangement in the 
anticorruption struggle; continuously and successfully grasp the 
struggle; and score marked results in the struggle so as to win 
the people's trust. We should adopt an earnest attitude toward 
the problems of markets and commodity prices. Relaxing the 
restriction on the marketing prices of many commodities does not 
mean to cancel the macro control over prices. In particular, we 
should resolutely bring under control the prices of the people's 
necessities, such as grains, vegetables, and nonstaple 
foodstuffs. Efforts should be made to realistically enhance the 
comprehensive management of public security and to deal heavy 
blows in a timely manner at serious crimes. Second, a good job 
should be realistically done in dealing with the problems of 
production and livelihood of staff members and workers, which 
have encountered by enterprises that are in the state of 
production suspension or semi suspension. We should enhance the 
work of handling the petition letters from the mass and 
receiving the petition visits paid by the people and 
realistically assume the responsibility in the work. This 
represents the important work of maintaining the stability and 
the concrete expression of the party in fulfilling its purpose 
of serving the people wholeheartedly. Third, a good job should 
be done in stabilizing the work undertaken by higher educational 
institutions. While enhancing the positive education, attention 
should be paid to adopting multiple forms suitable to the youth 
characteristics so as to lead youths to concentrate their 
efforts on showing concern for reform, modernizations, and 
studies. 
  Ma Guoliang, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, delivered a speech at the meeting, in which he 
pointed out: Efforts should be made to seize the historical 
opportunity and to broaden the opening up. Units from top to 
bottom across the province should unify their thinking, heighten 
their spirit, and be reliant or become strong independently. To 
turn the factors that are restricting the province's development 
into strong points, cadres at all levels should train hard in 
their professional skills; truly grasp study and do practical 
deeds for their work; and carry forward the spirit of making 
all-out efforts. They should fulfill the target harbored by 
them, turn the concerns shown by the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council into motive forces, and be worthy of the great 
trust the 36 million people place in them. In line with the 
demand of seizing the opportunity, various departments should 
vigorously grasp the implementation of tasks; broaden the 
achievements; make a breakthrough in key areas; and achieve 
overall progress. Cadres at all levels should improve their 
work style, be vigorously willing to go down to grass-roots 
level units, and commonly make efforts with these units to 
improve the work as soon as possible. 
  Vice Governor Cong Fukui also delivered a speech at the 
meeting, in which he pointed out: Various localities should do 
a good job in relaying and implementing the work arrangements 
recently made by the provincial party committee and the 
provincial people's government. They should actively make 
concerted efforts in relaying and implementing the arrangements 
and start the implementation of these arrangements as soon as 
possible so as to enable every work arrangement to be in place 
at an early date.

  [Text] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng chaired 
the 19th executive meeting of the State Council today. The 
meeting examined and adopted, in principle, the "Detailed Rules 
for Implementing the PRC State Security Law (Draft)," and 
discussed other issues. 
  The meeting maintained that, since the 30th session of the 
Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee adopted 
and promulgated it on 22 February 1993, the "PRC State Security 
Law" has played an important part in maintaining state security, 
in defending China's people's democratic dictatorship and 
socialist system, and in safeguarding the smooth progress of 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. It maintained, 
however, that detailed implementation rules should be drawn up 
on the basis of the State Security Law so that the law can be 
implemented more effectively. 
  The meeting decided that the State Council will promulgate 
the detailed implementation rules (draft) after they have been 
further amended.

  [Text] Shanghai, 10 May (XINHUA) -- During his 8-10 May 
inspection tour of Shanghai, Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing 
Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice 
chairman of the Central Military Commission [CMC], said 
emphatically: The entire party and Army, as well as people 
across the country, should subordinate themslves to the overall 
task of economic construction, further strengthen the Army's 
unity with the people and the government, and make concerted 
efforts to contribute more to the socialist modernization drive.

achievements in economic construction. He said: The Shanghai 
municipal party committee and the municipal government have 
earnestly implemented Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and they have carried 
out their work vigorously. Shanghai has undergone phenomenal 
changes, and its situation is very good. On the Yanpu bridge, 
CMC Vice Chairman Liu Huaqing joyously told Zhu Zhihao, who was 
in charge of directing the bridge's construction: The working 
class in Shanghai has rendered outstanding services and boosted

Jiang Qianfeng (3068 6929 1496) and Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 
4376): "Make Educational Development A Strategic Priority -- An 
Account of Beijing's Practice of Respecting Teachers and 
Stressing Education"] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 20 Apr (XINHUA) -- The educational 
circle of Beijing experienced two pleasant events in 1993: 
After seven years of hard work, Beijing led the country in 
basically universalizing the nine-year compulsory educational 
system and in essentially eliminating illiteracy among young and 
middle-aged people. This was the fruit of all-out efforts by 
Beijing Municipality over the past few years to promote the 
practice of respecting teachers and stressing education, as well 
as the practical turns it did for education. [passage omitted] 
  In 1982, Chen Xitong, who had just assumed the mayoralty, 
attended a meeting of the municipal committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] to hear 
opinions. Several CPPCC members presented their cases 
passionately, expressing their views and raising questions 
before him. Their sharp words revealed their true and sincere 
feelings. Chen Xitong expressed his heartfelt thanks for the 
"friends who do not hesitate to offer admonition." On a 
blackboard in a suburban normal school which he visited shortly 
thereafter, he saw a newly composed verse to the effect that 
education was not being given due attention, that nobody cared 
about the poor teachers, and that "nobody showed compassion" for 
education, which resembled an orphan. Once again, the new mayor 
was deeply moved by the words. He felt that he would not be 
able to justify himself before the people, and would be 
negligent in his duties, if he did not make up his mind to 
improve educational services in Beijing. 
  At that time, there was a lack of common understanding about 
education. Some comrades asked: If we stress education, what 
about other professions? If we raise teachers' salaries, what 
should we do about the pay of other workers and staff members? 
[passage omitted] 
  Reviewing that period, Chen Xitong, who is now secretary of 
the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, said: The key to whether 
education is truly considered important lies in determination on 
the part of leaders at all levels. Only by conducting 
investigations and studies in schools can we understand the 
conditions of schools, teachers, and the practical problems and 
hardships in running schools; only by doing so can we develop 
feelings toward education. When leaders at all levels show real 
feelings for education, they will develop a common language and 
show a common determination. [passage omitted] 
  Chen Xitong said: Competition in today's society ultimately 
consists in vying for professionally trained people. We cannot 
merely ferret out such people; the more important thing is to 
train them. If we now invest our money in education, we shall 
have large numbers of useful people in the future for our 
modernization drive. [passage omitted] 
  During the interview [not previously mentioned; date and 
place not given], Chen Xitong told the reporters: The party 
Central Committee and the State Council take educational work 
seriously. Although Beijing has achieved some success in 
educational work, it still falls far short of the demands of the 
central authorities and people throughout the municipality, and 
there remain quite a few problems. At present, further efforts 
should be undertaken to deepen educational reform and improve 
teachers' salaries and living quarters. More school buildings 
need to be constructed so that schools will not institute the 
"two-shift system" to cope with yet another surge in enrollment. 
Further efforts should be made to solve new problems and 
difficulties in connection with school administration. We must 
remain level-headed, identify areas where we are lagging, 
continue our efforts, devote great efforts to educational 
reform, and resolutely improve education.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Communist Party 
leaders must combine theoretical study with practice and use it 
to solve practical problems, a senior Communist Party official 
said here today. 
  Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
China (CPC) and president of the Central Party School, made 
these remarks at a seminar which started here today. 
  He told those provincial and ministerial leaders attending 
the theoretical seminar on study of the Third Volume of 
The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping that while they 
are studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, they should make concentrated efforts 
on two issues -- to master the theoretical systems of Deng and 
to use the theory to solve existing practical problems. 
  "Only when one has grasped the scientific world outlook and 
methodology can one judge the situation in a correct way and... 
brush aside difficulties, and promote the reform and open policy 
and the socialist modernization cause to a further degree," he 
said. 
  He noted that while the general situation is good, there are 
still certain problems and difficulties in China's social and 
economic lives. Party leaders should have a clear idea about 
that situation and seek a scientific way out through reform and 
development. 
  He pointed out that party leaders should take bold steps in 
probing for solutions to the existing problems under the 
guidance of scientific theories. 
  "If we want to do all tasks well, and consolidate and 
enhance 
the existing good situation, we must upgrade our theoretical 
level so that we can better take leading responsibility," he 
stressed. 
  The present basic task for the whole party in further 
studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics is to grasp the whole theoretical system 
and use it to solve existing leading problems through profound 
study and investigations, he told those leaders attending the 
opening ceremony. 
  At present, the party should take effective measures to 
solve 
problems unfavorable to further reform, development and 
stability as China's economy will keep growing at a rapid speed 
and in a healthy way this year through a series of reforms, 
aiming to build a socialist market mechanism. 
  He called on the leaders to build the Communist Party better 
in terms of ideology, politics, party organization and style so 
that the party will be more united, attractive and forceful. 
  Ding Guangen, member of the Politburo of the CPC Central 
Committee and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee, hosted today's meeting. Ren Jianxin, also member of 
the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, attended today's 
meeting.
