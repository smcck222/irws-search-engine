  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- A farewell ceremony was 
held here today for Zhu Futang, a well-known pediatrician and an 
academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who died on 
April 23 at the age of 95. 
  More than 600 people, including Chen Xitong, member of the 
Politbureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
China (CPC), Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee 
of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), and Chen 
Minzhang, minister of public health, attended the ceremony. 
  Founder of China's modern pediatrics, Zhu was also an 
educator and honorary president of the Beijing Children's 
Hospital. 
  A native of Wuxi city in east China's Jiangsu Province, he 
graduated from the Beijing Union Medical College in 1927 and 
obtained a doctor's degree from the State University of New York 
of the United States. 
  In 1931 he went to the United States to study pediatrics, 
majoring in the prevention of children's measles through 
placental globulin, and was highly praised by TIME magazine at 
that time. 
  Zhu's achievements in that study are still helping 
pediatricians in many hospitals around the world today. 
  He returned to China in 1933 and with others set up the 
private Beijing Pediatrics Hospital in 1942. 
  In the 1960s, he and other Chinese pediatricians invented a 
new vaccine for measles and promoted it across the nation. The 
vaccine effectively reduced the occurrence of and mortality rate 
from children's measles in China. 
  His work Practical Pediatrics, which was first 
published in 1943, was highly praised by fellow pediatricians 
around the world. In 1993, that book was awarded a national best 
prize. 
  He also set up a training seminar, through which several 
generations of pediatricians in China were trained. In 1991, 
the ministry of public health set up the "Zhu Futang Prize" in 
his honor, an award to recognize outstanding pediatricians in 
China annually.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (CNS) -- Chairman of the Chinese 
Association for the Handicapped Mr. Deng Pufang said that to 
talk of humanitarianism and human rights without taking into 
account clothing and food problems was insincere and unrealistic. 
  In a press conference on a sports meeting for the 
handicapped 
in the Far East and South Pacific region, Mr. Deng, the son of 
Deng Xiaoping, made these remarks in reply to a question on the 
relationship between humanitarianism and human rights. He said 
that humanitarianism and human rights were closely related with 
the former regarded as an ideal to be sought for which covers 
the fact that every person is entitled to enjoy the rights of 
man and humanitarianism can help realize the value of mankind. 
He added that China put a strong emphasis on humanitarianism 
and human rights. During the last few years China did its very 
best to protect the rights and interests of the handicapped. 
  With China's reform and open door policy going further, Mr. 
Deng said that the living standard of the general public was 
becoming better while that of the handicapped was improving 
gradually. He added that there had been dramatic changes in 
China in the past few years when people's lives took a turn for 
the better. People could achieve their goal and hopes through 
their own efforts. 
  Mr. Deng pointed out that generally speaking the living 
standard for handicapped people in China had to some extent 
improved while many disabled people were still facing various 
kinds of difficulties including clothing and food problems with 
their economic life in no way guaranteed.

Federation for the Disabled and chairman of the Preparatory 
Committee for the Sixth Far East and South Pacific Games for the 
Disabled; Zhang Baifa, executive vice chairman of the 
preparatory committee and vice mayor of Beijing; and Wan Siquan, 
secretary general of the preparatory committee, with foreign and 
domestic correspondents in Beijing on 10 May, hosted by the 
State Council Information Office -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Announcer] A ZHONGGUO 
XINWEN SHE correspondent asked Deng Pufang for his comments 
about the first gathering in Beijing of disabled athletes from 
both sides of the Taiwan Straits as well as from Hong Kong and 
Macao. 
  [Deng] Both comrades from the Preparatory Committee and 
myself are delighted that athletes from Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Taiwan will be participating in the games. On the one hand, the 
Preparatory Committee will try its best to serve them and make 
them feel at home. On the other, I wish them good results. I 
shall be as delighted if they achieve good results as I shall be 
if mainland- based disabled athletes do the same. 
  [Announcer] Taibei's [Taipei] CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY would like 
to ask Deng two questions. The first is whether you have any 
plans to visit Taiwan in the near future. The second is what 
expectations you have regarding exchanges between disabled 
athletes from the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. 
  [Deng] I very much hope to visit Taiwan because Taiwan is 
part of China's territory. I am now seeking an opportunity to 
visit. Once conditions are right, I will definitely visit 
Taiwan. We also have had many contacts with Taiwan's disabled 
in recent years. We will continue such contacts and exchanges. 
In my opinion, contacts between the disabled are least 
susceptible to interference and influence from other factors. 
My disabled friends in Taiwan and myself share this common 
understanding and wish. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Patriarch Deng Xiaoping may be officially retired 
but he still ranks as a central leader of the Communist Party, 
his son, Deng Pufang, inadvertently revealed yesterday. 
  Asked at a press conference if his father would be attending 
any of the ceremonies at the forthcoming Far East and South 
Pacific Disabled Persons Games in Beijing, Mr Deng said: "The 
time has not yet come to issue invitations to central leaders". 
  Deng Xiaoping resigned from his last official post as 
chairman of the party's central military commission in 1989 and 
according to official reports has been leading a life of 
relatively quiet retirement since. 
  It is an open secret, however, that Mr Deng still retains 
considerable influence over party policy and his son's comments 
yesterday clearly showed he was still regarded as a key member 
of the central leadership. 
  Mr Deng Pufang also dismissed reports that his father was 
seriously ill and had been in hospital, saying he was still in 
"very good health". 
  "I deeply regret that these rumours (about Deng Xiaoping's 
health) have been circulating recently," he said. 
  Mr Deng Pufang did not go as far as his sisters and claim 
that his father managed to walk three kilometres a day but he 
did say that as the weather in Beijing improved his father would 
be taking leisurely walks outdoors. 
  His father would also be spending a lot of time glued to the 
television watching the World Cup this summer he added. 
  "He is a great football fan, so I am sure he will watching a 
lot of games on television this summer," he said.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Deng Xiaoping is no longer in full control. The 
patriarch's grip on affairs of state is weakening by the day. 
Sources close to his family said that while the patriarch 
suffers from no life-threatening diseases his prostate cancer 
was brought under control a few years ago -- what they referred 
to as his "old man's ailment" had deteriorated. 
  They said on the "better days", Mr Deng was fit enough to 
hear briefings for periods of 30 minutes or so. These days of 
lucidity, however, have become rarer. 
  The helmsman of 1.15 billion people can no longer attend to 
the details of governance. His energy level only allows him to 
be apprised of the most essential matters such as the inflation 
rate and China's Most Favoured Nation status in America. His 
"briefers" are daughter Deng Rong and members of the Deng 
Office, including its director, General Wang Ruilin. However, 
since Mr Deng mumbles so badly he can hardly make himself 
understood, not even the "imperial lip readers" can be really 
sure of his reactions to whatever information he has taken in. 
  To dispel speculation about Mr Deng's impending rendezvous 
with Karl Marx, the Politburo decided last year that his 
offspring and relatives should keep to their regular overseas 
travels. Diplomats said the protestation by the Foreign 
Ministry spokesman last Thursday that Mr Deng was "in very good 
health" was an indirect confirmation of the severity of his 
physical condition. The same spokesman's claims in April 1993 
that Premier Li Peng "only had flu" was newspeak for him having 
suffered a major heart attack. 
  Insiders said a ferocious power struggle could break out 
along the following lines. Holders of vested interests -- 
mainly the Deng family and Mr Deng's anointed successors such as 
President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji -- would take 
advantage of their position as palace guards to maintain the 
status quo. 
  Ms Deng, who is believed to have formed a power pact with Mr 
Jiang, has repeatedly stressed that her father favours 
"stability" and that he has full confidence in the President as 
the "core of the third-generation leadership. Mr Jiang, whose 
ability to jockey for position is as brilliant as his track 
record for market reform is lacklustre, has stepped up his 
campaign to woo two principal power blocs: the People's 
Liberation Army (PLA) and the so-called Shanghai Faction. 
  Since becoming Chairman of the Central Military Commission 
(CMC) in late 1989, Mr Jiang has visited more than 100 army 
units in all the seven military regions. Since late last year, 
the President is believed to have cemented his ties with key PLA 
players including CMC Vice-Chairman Zhang Zhen, Defence Minister 
Chi Haotian, and General Wang. Sources said Mr Jiang had 
recently given the generals carte blanche in areas including 
arms purchase and the expansion of the military business empire. 
  The President, a former party boss of Shanghai, has elevated 
a large number of the affiliates of the Shanghai Faction to 
crucial positions in the party apparatus since 1992. Last 
month, Mr Jiang paid a visit to Shanghai in an apparent effort 
to consolidate his power base before the showdown. Upon Mr 
Deng's total departure, Mr Jiang will likely follow in the 
footsteps of former party chairman Hua Guofeng and brandish the 
New Helmsman's will, which is expected to be along the lines of 
"With you (Jiang) in charge, my heart is at ease". 
  It will not, however, be plain-sailing. Forces at both ends 
of the political spectrum -- the dissidents and the remnant 
Maoists - have mapped out plans to challenge the succession. 
Both the rightists and leftists will try to win popular support 
by exposing Mr Deng's responsibility for the massacre -- and Mr 
Jiang's complicity as one of the patriarch's advisers in the 
military crackdown. 
  Even assuming that Mr Jiang and such members of the 
Mainstream Faction as Vice-Premier Zhu could ride out the storm 
that ensues upon Mr Deng's death -- which will include vicious 
street demonstrations -- their strengths may be sapped. Should 
the heirs apparent falter, the men to watch will be leaders of 
the party's "non-mainstream" faction: former president and 
retired general Yang Shangkun; former National People's Congress 
(NPC) chairman Wan Li; Mr Wan's successor as parliament chief, 
Qiao Shi and Mr Qiao's deputy, Tian Jiyun. 
  Relatively speaking, all four are liberals. Since the 
Tiananmen Square bloodbath, they have at one time or another 
been shoved aside by Mr Deng for reasons such as failure to back 
the armed suppression and readiness to overturn the verdict on 
the anti-party "turmoil". 
  Last winter, Mr Deng made possibly his last major political 
decision by appointing Mr Wan a senior spokesman of the council 
of elders. Analysts said while Mr Wan had accepted the slot, it 
was doubtful whether he would repay Mr Deng by funnelling 
support to Mr Jiang. Since falling out with Mr Deng in late 
1992, Mr Yang has been plotting a comeback. Early this year, 
the head of the disgraced Yang Clan toured Guangdong, one of his 
power bases, with the apparent aim of securing the backing of 
the nation's most forward-looking province. 
  Since becoming respectively NPC Chairman and 
Vice-Chairman in April 1993, Mr Qiao and Mr Tian have buttressed 
their positions by forging links with regional congresses and 
promoting the heretical idea of the "supervision of the party 
and government by the legislature". Observers say much depends 
on whether Messrs Yang, Wan, Qiao and Tian can pool their 
resources and win the blessings of such "progressive forces" as 
the party's old liberal wing, the regional "warlords" and the 
entrepreneurs. 
  A number of luminaries among the party's 
"bourgeois-liberals", including ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang 
and former propaganda chief Zhu Houze, have displayed signs of 
restiveness. In the past year, Mr Zhao and Mr Zhu have toured 
several provinces -- and been received like heroes by local 
chieftains. 
  Then there is the attitude of the top brass. On the surface 
Mr Jiang should feel confident because as CMC Chairman, he had a 
hand in the appointment of several hundred mid-to top-echelon 
officers in the past 18 months. The 21st century, however is 
not on the side of the president. Mr Jiang is a product of the 
ancient regime rather than a prophet of the emerging economic 
superpower. 
  The PLA -- and the party -- is increasingly being run by 
cadres who are hooked to those types of satellite-television 
programmes that Mr Jiang helped to ban. In the world without a 
helmsman, the army, like other sectors of society, will cast 
their vote for whoever could nudge them closer to the 
Asia-Pacific century.

  [Excerpts] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Liu Jiachen, vice 
president of the Supreme People's Court, made an announcement in 
Beijing today: People's courts in various places have completed 
the trial of four serious cases involving theft and damage to 
railways, oilfields, electric power equipment, and 
communications facilities. Six law offenders were sentenced to 
death and were executed by shooting in Daqing, Liuzhou, 
Zhumadian and Huanggang respectively today. 
  At a news briefing held by the Supreme People's Court, Liu 
Jiachen said: Recently, serious crimes involving theft and 
damage to railways, oilfields, and electric power and 
communications facilities have been rampant. Those criminal 
activities are very harmful to public security, social 
stability, state property, and the smooth building of the 
national economy. The carrying out of the death sentence of the 
six criminals who committed heinous crimes is a demonstration of 
the resolute and forceful struggle against such activities waged 
by the people's courts as state adjudication organizations. 
[passage omitted] 
  After the people's courts passed their initial judgments, 
all 
six criminals appealed. The higher people's courts in 
Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Henan, and Hubei rejected the appeals and 
affirmed the original judgments in their final decisions.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Six criminals who have 
plundered rails, electrical wires, communications facilities and 
materials from oilfields have been sentenced to death by local 
Chinese courts and were executed today. 
  Vice-President of China's Supreme Court Liu Jiachen said at 
a 
press conference here this afternoon that the crimes of stealing 
and damaging facilities for railways, oilfields, power and 
communications have become very rampant recently, which has done 
great harm to public security, social stability and the national 
economy. 
  Liu Xiaoguang, a 27-year-old jobless man, and his accomplice 
Zhang Guobin, 26, had plundered types of valves, seamless steel, 
tires and other materials valued at 520,000 yuan from the Daqing 
oilfield on 20 occasions from January to September 1992. The 
two were sentenced to death by the Daqing Intermediate Court of 
Heilongjiang Province in northeast China. 
  Chen Guiluo, a 35-year-old railway worker, together with six 
other accomplices, had committed six burglaries at five railway 
stations and along the railway lines from April to June 1993. 
He had plundered more than 140 tons of rails and 111 wooden 
ties valued at 400,000 yuan. 
  While being held at the police bureau, Chen tried to flee 
with other detainees. He was sentenced to death by the Special 
Intermediate Court for Railway Transportation of Liuzhou city in 
southwest China. 
  Two peasants, Zang Wenli and Zang Genzhu, stole 60,000 
meters 
of telephone line worth 90,000 yuan in one year's time. Direct 
loss from the crime was 100,000 yuan and indirect loss was more 
than 2.45 million yuan. They were sentenced to death by the 
Intermediate Court of Zhumadian city of Henan Province in 
central China. 
  Hu Xinqi, a 22-year-old peasant, together with four other 
accomplices, had plundered or damaged 11 working electrical 
transformers from February to June 1993, and had brought about 
45,000 yuan in direct economic losses as well as bringing about 
great disruptions in people's lives and local rural production. 
He was sentenced to death by the Huanggang Intermediate Court 
of Hubei Province. 
  The six convicts appealed to higher courts after the 
sentences. All appeals were rejected, with original sentences 
maintained. 
  The Vice-President Li Jiachen said that what the convicts 
had 
stolen were large and heavy facilities of high value. The 
crimes were also perpetrated on a fairly large scale with 
multiple accomplices. 
  "Such criminals, who pay no attention to the public security 
and law of the state, must be punished severely according to 
law," he stressed.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page by Wen Jing, vice minister </F>
of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission: "Ethnic Groups 
Flourish With More State Funds"] 
  [Text] Ethnic minorities have benefited greatly from 
preferential policies the government gives to their regions. 
  Last year, gross national product (GNP) in provinces and 
autonomous regions with a high density of ethnic groups -- Inner 
Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou and 
Qinghai -- reached 293.8 billion yuan ($33.8 billion). And the 
annual per capita income of farmers and herdsmen in the eight 
areas exceeded 720 yuan ($83). 
  China has 55 minority nationalities with a total population 
of 91 million. Most live in remote mountain areas where the 
economy has traditionally lagged behind other parts of the 
country. 
  But since 1949, the government has worked out a series of 
preferential policies to promote economic growth in these areas. 
  In 1984, a law governing the regional autonomy of minority 
nationalities laid the foundation for the development of 
relationships between all nationalities as well as economic, 
cultural, scientific and technological progress. 
  There are five autonomous regions, 30 autonomous prefectures 
and 123 autonomous counties. 
  To advance local industry, the government started 1,400 
large 
and medium-sized enterprises in the eight autonomous regions and 
provinces. These enterprises have since become the pillars of 
the local economy. And industry is now complementary to the 
traditional agriculture and animal husbandry. 
  Last year, the total output value of agriculture and 
industry 
in these areas hit 540 billion yuan ($62 billion). Industry 
accounted for 59.8 percent of the local economy, up from 14.8 
percent in 1949. 
  In recent years, township enterprises in ethnic areas have 
progressed steadily. Relying on local natural resources, labour 
and State loans, these enterprises are engaged in a diverse 
range of industries. 
  From 1991 to 1995, the State will allocate 100 million yuan 
($11.5 million) in low-interest loans to these enterprises. 
  State subsidies have been promoting economic growth in 
minority nationality regions. 
  In 1955 a special subsidy for minority nationality regions 
was set up. In 1964, two reserve funds were established for 
these regions. By the end of 1979, the State had allocated more 
than 3 billion yuan ($344 million) to minority regions through 
the three projects. 
  From 1980 to 1987, grants increase by 10 percent under a new 
State subsidy system. By 1991, the grants totaled 80 billion 
yuan ($9.2 billion). 
  In 1980, the government set up a development fund for 
economically backward regions. By 1991, half of the fund, 4 
billion yuan ($459 million), went to minority nationality 
regions. 
  Ethnic regions also topped the State agenda for poverty 
relief. The poverty line in these areas was set lower than other 
regions so that more counties would benefit from the State 
subsidies. 
  Eleven years ago the government provided 200 million yuan 
($23 million) in annual loans to the agricultural development 
fund in Hexi and Dingxi, of Gansu Province, and Xihaigu, of 
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The loans will continue until 
the end of the century. 
  To create a favourable environment for economic development, 
the State spent 10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) on materials for 
the regions to upgrade infrastructure. 
  And in 1990 the State set up a special fund to provide 
minority people with sufficient, food and clothing; the fund 
covers 143 poverty stricken counties in ethnic areas. 
  As a result of government efforts, minority living standards 
have greatly improved. In 1992, the per capita income of 
farmers and herdsmen in the autonomous areas hit 548 yuan ($63), 
six times that of 1978. 
  Minority nationality regions, however, took longer to open 
up 
to the outside world compared to coastal areas. 
  But since China has developed friendly relations with its 
neighboring countries, the government has encouraged minority 
regions to make the most of their geographical positions and 
boost their border trade. 
  China has 22,000 kilometres of border land, of which 19,000 
kilometres are in minority regions. 
  Last year, trade in the eight autonomous regions and 
provinces reached $5.7 billion. And trade with Russia, Myanmar 
[Burma] and Vietnam is especially active. 
  Due to diverse traditions and customs, minorities have 
different kinds of daily necessities. 
  Before 1949, ethnic regions suffered a shortage of daily 
necessities. They had problems exporting the locally made 
products, and consequently, prices for these goods were very low. 
  Over the past four decades, the government worked hard to 
rectify the existing price structure, subsidizing grocery stores. 
  And companies producing goods for minority groups enjoy 
preferential loans, investment and taxation policies. Special 
low-interest loans have also been set up to help the technical 
innovation of these enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- China has declared that 
it will continue its macro control over the development of 
higher education this year. 
  The State Education Commission insists that all students 
must 
take the unified national examination for college entrance, 
otherwise, no graduation certificates will be given. 
  To prevent unauthorized colleges from expanding enrollment, 
the government will issue for the first time forgery-proof 
graduation certificates. 
  And the total enrollment nationwide will be reduced by about 
30,000 over last year. 
  "These are the toughest control measures for many years," 
said Xu Dunhuang, who is in charge of the plan. 
  The commission has reported that the enrollment reached 
924,000 last year, up 22.5 percent over 1992. That made a total 
of 2.53 million students on campuses, up 16.1 percent over 1992. 
  However, the growth of student number exceeded the economic 
growth of 13.4 percent last year, putting the education sector 
in the doldrums. 
  Dormitories have become more crowded. Over 100 universities 
and colleges were not able to meet the official requirements for 
residence conditions last year. 
  Teaching and research equipment is insufficient or outdated, 
owing to funding problems. About 160 colleges of science or 
engineering cannot meet the official standards. More 
difficulties were found in liberal arts schools. 
  Compared to the fast growth of higher education, basic 
education has been slow. Last year about 73 percent of eligible 
students went to junior middle schools, up only 1.2 percent over 
1992. 
  "The situation reveals that the current state investment 
level cannot support the growth of education," said Xu. 
  However, Xu said, the government has decided to allow the 
number of students on campuses to grow by 6.5 percent each year, 
to reach 3.5 million before the year 2000. 
  This will enable 35 percent of Chinese youngsters of college 
age to receive higher education by then.

  [Excerpts] Members of the Standing Committee attending the 
Seventh Session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National 
People's Congress [NPC] today [9 May] examined the Draft Law on 
the Management of Urban Real Estate, the draft decision on 
punishing criminals who violate copyrights, and other proposals. 
[passage omitted] 
  Some members held that laws related to the Law on the 
Management of Urban Real Estate, such as the Land Administration 
Law, should also be formulated as quickly as possible. Some 
members said that, in order to prevent disputes over trifles 
among various real estate administrative departments, it is 
necessary to let one department assume unified management. 
  In examining the draft decision on punishing criminals who 
violate copyrights, some members said that, without clear and 
specific laws and regulations, the people's court will find it 
difficult to make punitive judgments. They eagerly hoped that 
the decision could be adopted after revision as quickly as 
possible. 
  The members today also examined the Draft Law on Judges and 
the Draft Law on Procurators.

  [Text] Beijing, may 10 (XINHUA) -- An executive meeting of 
the State Council, China's highest governing body, today 
approved in principle a set of draft detailed regulations for 
the implementation of China's State Security Law. 
  Participants in the meeting, presided over by Premier Li 
Peng, decided that the draft regulations will be revised before 
being issued by the State Council. 
  They agreed that since coming into force on February 22, 
1992, the State Security Law has played a significant role in 
maintaining state security, defending the people's democratic 
dictatorship and the socialist system, and ensuring the progress 
of the reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive. 
  The formulation of the detailed regulations is needed to 
enforce the law more effectively, they noted.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Ordinary Work Shining With </F>
Splendor of Dedication"] 
  [Text] "He stood upright in the manner of a Communist 
Party member." The people in Tianjin gave their heartfelt 
praise to Comrade Dai Chengjiang, a Communist Party member and 
people's policeman. People reading the newsletter about his 
deeds were moved to tears. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was worthy of 
the praise given by the masses. 
  People's policemen have certain powers for performing their 
official duties. It is rather convenient for them to use the 
powers in their hands to seek certain "real benefits" for 
themselves. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was always sober-headed in 
facing this issue, and drew a clear line of demarcation between 
public duties and personal gains. When performing official 
duties, he gave the "red light" to his personal affairs and the 
private affairs of his family and friends, and even refused to 
buy a pair of shoes for his wife at the wholesale price. Did he 
lead a well-off life? No. The difficulties he was facing was 
self-evident because he had to support a family of three 
generations with his salary alone, as his wife was working in a 
unit that was mired in financial difficulties. Then why did he 
turn down such little benefits? Because he was determined to 
safeguard the solemnity and purity of the national emblem on his 
cap, and to keep it from being sullied by self-interest and 
corruption. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was deeply aware that he had 
to always set strict demand on himself and keep himself 
incorrupt and honest in order to really win the masses' trust 
and support and to properly perform his official duties. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong said: It is not hard for one to do a bit 
of good; what is hard is to do good all one's life and never do 
anything bad. Comrade Dai Chengjiang was precisely this kind of 
model Communist Party member. He always did good, not because 
he acted on impulse, not because he wanted to earn some capital 
for himself in order to climb to a higher position and gain 
greater benefits; instead he did good really and wholeheartedly 
for the purpose of seeking benefit for the people. In the eyes 
of some people, his behavior was "no longer suited to the 
current conditions" and he was too "silly." After Comrade Dai 
Chengjiang's death, however, Tianjin residents spontaneously 
braved the bitterly cold winds to take part in a funeral 
procession. This was the best evaluation of a man's life. 
Comrade Dai Chengjiang carried forward the Chinese nation's 
uprightness and the Communists' lofty belief. Seeing the strong 
repercussions evoked by Comrade Dai Chengjiang among the people, 
are the people who are keen only to seek private gains and line 
their pockets not ashamed of their behavior? 
  Comrade Dai Chengjiang stood at his posts for more that 23 
years and always faithfully performed his duties by doing 
innumerable little and ordinary things. The little things he 
did showed his lofty spirit, and the ordinary work shone with 
the splendor of dedication. This splendor lit up the hearts of 
hundreds of millions of people, and encouraged the vast numbers 
of cadres and masses to make progress and work with one heart 
and one mind by following in the footprints of the hero.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Respectable Master of the House"] </F>
  [Text] Today, this newspaper carried a report entitled 
"Aspirations Under the Wings" about the progressive deeds of Li 
Guangnan, who behaved as a master. The report was aimed at 
prompting people to consider this question: What should we do, 
as we too are masters? 
  Li Guangnan was born to a peasant family of the Korean 
nationality at the foot of the Changbai Mountains. From the 
parent generation's bitter experience of being enslaved by the 
Japanese invaders and from modern China's experience of being 
bullied, humiliated, and carved up by foreign powers, Li 
Guangnan -- while still a student -- began to have patriotic 
thoughts and to aspire to render service to his motherland. 
After growing up and joining the armed forces, his patriotic 
consciousness was further enhanced, and he acquired a stronger 
sense of responsibility as a master. He often said: The Army 
is ours, and the country is ours; if we do not build them up and 
love them, who will do this? Such love for the motherland added 
inexhaustible wisdom and strength to Li Guangnan in rendering 
service to the motherland. He is an ordinary member of the 
ground crew in the air force, and has received only junior 
secondary education, but he never feels that he bears no 
responsibility for the motherland because of his humble 
position. He is deeply concerned about the destiny of the nation 
and has a strong sense of urgency for the times while working 
hard and selflessly at his own post and performing first-rate 
work for China's regeneration. 
  Li Guangnan is a respectable and laudable master. To learn 
from Li Guangnan, we should behave like him in making 
painstaking efforts to study modern science and technology, and 
to master the skills needed for rendering service to the 
motherland. Like him, we should work selflessly at our own 
posts, thus turning our patriotic enthusiasm and aspirations for 
rendering service to the motherland into concrete action. Of 
course, the most important point is that, like Li Guangnan, we 
should love our socialist motherland. This is the ideological 
base for establishing the master spirit and increasing the sense 
of responsibility as a master. The party central leadership has 
pointed out that the ideology of patriotism, socialism, and 
collectivism should be the main theme in our society as a whole. 
Singing the main theme loudly and carrying forward patriotism 
are of great significance for boosting our national morale, 
increasing our nation's rallying force, deepening reform, 
expanding opening, and promoting the vigorous development of our 
work in all fields. 
  At present, the reform in our country is developing in 
depth. 
Beyond any doubt, the patriotic spirit of the master should be 
reflected in the great practice of participating in the reform. 
We must give top priority to the overall interests of the 
reform; correctly handle the relationship between the interests 
of the state, the collective, and the individual; consciously 
resist the influence of money worship, hedonism, and extreme 
egoism. We should share the concern of the whole nation and 
meet the urgent needs of the whole nation as masters, and should 
understand the difficulties the reform faces and join hands in 
overcoming such difficulties by offering constructive 
suggestions and making positive efforts. In short, we should 
take reform as our own duty; only thus can we be worthy of the 
glorious title of the state's masters.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- A ceremony was held in 
Beijing today to mark the publication of the Comprehensive 
Chinese Dictionary. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and other 
leaders Ding Guangen, Li Lanqing and Li Tieying attended the 
ceremony to express congratulations to the editors of the 
dictionary. 
  In 1975, the late Premier Zhou Enlai approved the editing 
and 
publishing of the dictionary. After 18 years of effort, the 12 
volume dictionary was completed in April. 
  The dictionary collects 375,000 entries including about 50 
million Chinese characters and 2,253 illustrations. 
  Jiang Zemin said that the publication of the dictionary is a 
bumper harvest from Chinese cultural, academic, educational and 
publications fields. 
  China has a splendid culture with more than 5,000 years of 
history, he noted, adding that the publication of the dictionary 
represents the developed Chinese culture and will make 
historical contributions to the development of Chinese culture. 
  He said that the academic and publications fields are 
expected to turn out more books and lexicographical works. 
  At the ceremony, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng's inscriptions for 
the dictionary were announced. 
  The dictionary was jointly edited and compiled by 43 units 
including universities, institutes and publishing houses in 
Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian and Shanghai.

<F P=106> [By Cao Min and Hong Xia: "Most Units Complying With New </F>
Work Hours"] 
  [Text] More than 90 percent of State and collective 
enterprises have complied with the State Council decree to 
reduce the work week from 48 to 44 hours, a labour official said 
yesterday. 
  Enterprises that have failed to make the change will be 
criticized and ordered to implement the practice within the 
shortest possible period, according to Lin Xiaoning, an official 
of the Ministry of Labour. 
  Since the law took effect on March 1, the Beijing Labour 
Bureau has received over 20 complaints from workers, most of 
whom blamed their employers for forcing them to work overtime in 
violation of the government decree. 
  Employees at the Shougang General Company (formally Capital 
Iron and Steel Company) complained last month to the mayor that 
they still were not getting two days off every other weekend. 
  They said in addition to working the maximum 44 hours a 
week, 
they were also asked to spend another four hours on political 
study and training each week. 
  Several days later, Shougang granted them their two days off 
every other weekend. 
  Under the work-week law, which all companies were to comply 
with by May 1, workers must be paid overtime if they put in more 
than 44 hours per week. Extra hours may not exceed three hours 
per day. 
  To ensure companies meet these requirements, Beijing will 
offer more subsidies to units such as the public buses that have 
a hard time providing normal services within the shortened work 
week. 
  Trade unions have been asked to help supervise the new 
system 
to protect workers' rights, Lin said. 
  China replaced the 48-hour week, practised nationwide for 
the 
past 40 years, with the 44-hour week on March 1. Companies had 
until May 1 to adopt the system. 
  Lin was unclear about how well private and foreign-funded 
enterprises were complying with the law. Such companies 
employed 3 percent of China's 147 million urban workers as of 
the end of March this year. 
  But Lin said many State and collective enterprises, 
including 
all 14 bureaus under the Ministry of Railways, have made great 
efforts to adopt the system. 
  In Shanghai, where 1,727 enterprises started introducing a 
44-hour work week beginning in 1992, worker productivity has 
risen by 10 to 30 percent, Lin said. 
  The new work week has also been successfully introduced in 
most of Beijing's enterprises, institutions, hospitals and 
schools.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) of the Central </F>
People's Broadcasting Station and XINHUA reporter Sun Benyao 
(1327 2609 1031)] 
  [Excerpt] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- While meeting 
recipients of the first national award for excellent 
entrepreneurs with inventive achievements at the Great Hall of 
the People this afternoon, Li Peng, premier of the State 
Council, said: This is an era in which people of great talent 
come forth in great numbers. The broad masses of people, 
including the vast numbers of intellectuals and workers, have a 
vast reservoir of enthusiasm and creativity for socialist 
modernization; some of these people are very talented. We 
should provide them with better mechanism and environment to 
show off their talent, and enable them to make greater 
contributions to socialist modernization. 
  Premier Li Peng began by extending his warm congratulations 
at the meeting to recipients of the national award for excellent 
entrepreneurs with inventive achievements on behalf of the party 
Central Committee and State Council. 
  He said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping said science and technology 
are the primary productive forces. Scientific and technological 
progress, inventions, and creations decide whether or not an 
enterprise flourishes and develops. To flourish and develop, to 
consolidate its national strength, to improve its people's 
living standards, and to achieve the four modernizations, a 
country has to rely on scientific and technological progress 
also. Awarding excellent entrepreneurs who have made inventive 
achievements is a very meaningful thing to do. You are 
inventors as well as entrepreneurs. You have turned scientific 
and technological fruits into productive forces, introduced good 
products which meet market needs, and brought economic 
efficiency to enterprises -- all these greatly deserve 
recommendation. 
  Li Peng said: We have different types of inventions -- 
great, medium, and small ones. Great inventions can usher in a 
new scientific era. To a certain degree, the foundation for 
basic and applied sciences, which have great potentials and 
bright prospects, has been established in our country. Small 
inventions can promote social progress, make things convenient 
for the people, and make society efficient. Our country needs 
major inventions to scale new heights in science. In addition 
major inventions, we should also put a premium on small and 
practical inventions. 
  In his speech, Li Peng expressed the hope to see more 
inventions and creations being produced on all fronts, so that 
our motherland will thrive and prosper. 
  Leading Comrades Ni Zhifu, Li Peiyao, Song Jian, and Luo Gan 
attended the meeting and the first national award ceremony for 
excellent entrepreneurs with inventive achievements. [passage

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- A socialist market 
economy will eventually replace the planned economy, and the 
next few years will be crucial for that transition, senior 
Chinese official Li Tieying said here today. 
  Addressing the '94 China Summit, the state councillor said 
15 
years of reform and opening to the outside world have anchored 
the national economy on a fast-expansion track. As the world's 
last big market, China now holds great appeal for foreign 
investors. 
  From 1979 to 1993 China approved 174,000 joint ventures, 
which absorbed actual foreign capital totaling 63.9 billion U.S. 
dollars. In 1993 alone, foreign funds utilized by China amounted 
to 25.7 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Li said that China has in recent years put more stress on 
exchanges and co-operation in the opening-up drive, and 
encouraged competent domestic enterprises to invest overseas. 
  By 1993 China had launched 4,497 firms in 120 countries and 
regions, with 5.16 billion U.S. dollars in investment. 
  Li said that reform and opening conform to the fundamental 
interests of the Chinese people and contribute to world peace, 
stability and development as well. 
  "China will continue the reform and opening up process in 
the 
years to come," said Li. 
  Li, who is also the minister in charge of the State 
Commission on Restructuring the Economy, said that since 1992 
China's reform has centered around building up a socialist 
market economy in unprecedentedly big strides in the reform and 
opening-up policies. 
  He briefed the participants at the summit on China's reform 
blueprint and economic development strategy. 
  He said China will open up further to merge with the world 
economy. It will establish a transparent foreign trade system 
and actively participate in international competition and 
co-operation. 
  In pushing ahead with foreign trade reform, Li said, China 
will give more autonomy to foreign trade companies and set up a 
new import mechanism which will gradually allow the auctioning 
of and public bidding for import quotas and permits.

<F P=106> [By Antoine So: "Vice Premier Warns Against Squeeze on </F>
Export Prices"] 
  [Text] The vice premier has warned of a possible weakness 
in the reform of China's foreign trade policy that might allow 
foreign investors and suppliers to squeeze China's export prices. 
  State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing told officials of the 
Foreign Trade Ministry that in the process of reforming China's 
foreign trade policy, care must be taken against foreign 
corporations squeezing the prices of Chinese exports. He was 
speaking at the 57th anniversary of Guangzhou Stock Exchange. 
  Mr Li said that as China reformed its economy and become 
more 
open, exporters' profit margins might be squeezed as their 
suppliers took advantage of the booming export levels and 
charged unreasonably high prices. 
  He also said exporters should guard against foreign 
investors 
reducing the prices of China's exports. 
  Without commenting on the current situation, Mr Li said that 
price squeezing could adversely affect the country's balance of 
payments and thus the foreign exchange system. 
  Mr Li called on the Ministry of Foreign Trade to guard 
against any price squeezing by foreign investors. 
  He said privatization of state-owned enterprises, which 
would 
improve their efficiency, needed to continue as a way of 
preventing such price squeezing. 
  He said China had been very successful in attracting foreign 
investment in the 10 years since it started its open-door 
economic policy. Many former trade restrictions had been lifted 
and foreign investment has soared rapidly in recent years. 
  The foreign trade policy reform, in which international 
corporations were invited into the China market, had brought the 
country wealth and improvements, Mr Li said. 
  The State Statistics Bureau said foreign investment in the 
first quarter of the year alone had increased to U.S.$5.4 
billion (HK$42.1 billion), spread among 11,800 projects. In the 
past 10 years, China had approved 186,062 foreign investment 
projects with total contractual investment of U.S.$241.5 
billion, of which U.S.$67.2 billion had been put to use. 
  But state-owned corporations also needed to pay attention to 
improving product quality and to human resources in order to 
better compete in the market, Mr Li said. 
  As a first step to improving export quality, he urged a 
faster introduction of the International Standards Organizations 
ISO9000 product certification system.

XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 May (XINHUA) -- Speaking on 7 May at a 
national conference of commodity inspection bureau directors, Li 
Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
and vice premier of the State Council, said: We should further 
tighten commodity inspection, inspect and supervise product 
quality in accordance with the law, and exercise strict control 
over the quality of export and import products. 
  Li Lanqing said: Quality is not only the lifeblood of 
enterprises and foreign trade but also an important matter that 
bears on a country's reputation, national quality, and a 
country's economic and social development. People should be 
aware of the need to "develop the country by improving quality." 
Product quality, which is primarily the business of 
enterprises, should be improved scrupulously so that "coarse 
food grains will be turned into delicacies." However, commodity 
inspection departments bear heavy responsibility for checking 
quality. Our country's reform, opening up, and development of 
foreign economic relations and trade have increased the 
responsibility of commodity inspection departments. Although 
their main duty is to inspect quality, these departments should 
also take necessary measures to help and prod enterprises to 
improve the quality of their commodities. Commodity inspection 
departments should be impartial and incorruptible, should not be 
kind-hearted, and should be "fastidious." They should not 
"raise their hands" to allow substandard goods through, and 
should firmly prevent those goods from leaving the country. 
They should also continue to inspect the quality of imported 
goods in accordance with the law, so as to reduce unnecessary 
losses to the state and business operators. They should keep 
expanding the scope of commodity inspection and increase the 
inspection rate. In addition, they should further improve the 
quality and efficiency of their work, and serve units that 
engage in production and foreign trade. They should increase 
exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts, 
strive to bring themselves into line with international norms, 
and act according to international practice. Domestically, 
commodity inspection departments have approved more than 400 
laboratories in various lines of business, which should be 
allowed to perform their functions fully. Although they are the 
"main force," commodity inspection departments should make full 
use of social resources to compensate for their own limited 
resources. 
  Li Lanqing noted emphatically: Commodity inspection 
departments should further build up their ranks. They should 
pay attention to training various types of qualified personnel; 
they should not only cultivate senior- and mid-level personnel 
but should also strengthen in-service training, placing 
particular stress on the training of law enforcement personnel. 
Commodity inspection departments should never slacken their 
efforts at building clean government. Without a highly 
disciplined commodity inspection team which possesses a 
stringent work style and enforces laws impartially, it is 
impossible to accomplish our tasks. We should study and draw up 
several strong, easy-to-implement measures in light of the 
distinct features of the commodity inspection sector, and should 
implement those measures relentlessly. 
  In closing, Li Lanqing said: The party Central Committee and 
the State Council are very concerned about and supportive of 
commodity inspection work; party and government leaders in all 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under 
the central government also take such work seriously. This 
attests to the increasingly important role of commodity 
inspection work in national economic construction and foreign 
trade. We hope that comrades in commodity inspection 
departments will redouble their efforts and make fresh 
contributions to national economic construction and foreign 
trade.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xia Jun (1115 0193) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Chao Wen (6872 2429)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 Apr (XINHUA) -- Wen Jiabao, alternate 
member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of 
the CPC Central Committee, today pointed out at a discussion by 
some delegates attending the eighth national conference on 
experimental areas for rural reform: Rural reform, a major 
component of establishing a socialist market economic structure, 
is extremely important for our country's reform of the economic 
structure as a whole. We should further deepen rural reform 
according to the general objectives of establishing a socialist 
market economic structure. 
  Since the experimental areas for rural reform were 
designated 
in 1987, tremendous achievements have been made in 
institutionalizing and standardizing the results of rural reform 
and in exploring some major issues in this regard. 
  Wen Jiabao said: After the Third Plenary Session of the 
party's 11th Central Committee, rural areas took the lead in 
carrying out reform, scoring achievements attracting world 
attention. Reform effectively promoted the development of 
agriculture and the rural economy, bringing about historic 
changes in the countryside. At the same time, this also laid a 
foundation for the reform of the national economy as a whole. 
As the national economy is making the transition to a socialist 
market economy, new requirements are set for deepening rural 
reform. This calls for us to continue our arduous exploration 
in this regard. Compared with the past, the rural reform at the 
present stage has the following new features: 1) Rural reform 
touches more and more on deep-seated problems; 2) rural reform 
interweaves more and more with urban reform. This requires us 
to be more careful in making plans, choosing times, and 
determining the pace of reform. In deepening rural reform, we 
should not only define our objectives and tasks but also pay 
close attention to methods. We have gained a lot of experiences 
in rural reform over the past decade and more, which we should 
carry forward and develop. 
  Wen Jiabao pointed out: Our rural areas are in a 
transforming stage from the current level of sufficient food and 
clothing to a better-off level of moderate prosperity and from 
traditional to modern agriculture. The development of 
agriculture and the rural economy is now faced with two 
extremely arduous tasks: 1) It is necessary to ensure the 
adequate supply of farm products; and 2) it is necessary to 
ensure the steady increase of peasants' incomes. To achieve 
these two objectives, we must uphold and deepen rural reform 
according to the general plan and requirements for the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure. The 
current major tasks in deepening rural reform are: First, while 
stabilizing the household contract responsibility system with 
remuneration linked to output, we should promote the rational 
flow of production factors and the optimum distribution of rural 
economic resources. Second, we should vigorously develop 
professional market intermediate organizations and connect rural 
household production and management with the market in various 
ways. Third, we should strengthen the government's 
macroeconomic regulation and control over agriculture and 
effectively support and protect agriculture. 
  Wen Jiabao stressed: In the course of developing a socialist 
market economy in the countryside, we should strengthen the 
building of basic-level rural organizations and the development 
of a spiritual civilization and the legal system. We should 
"grasp two links at the same time and pay equal attention to 
both" and develop a material and a spiritual civilization 
simultaneously. This is something we should not overlook in 
doing research on rural reform and development. He called on 
comrades who are engaged in rural work and research on rural 
policy to strengthen their spirit and confidence and to make a 
fresh contribution to rural reform and development.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (CNS) -- Minister of Internal 
Trade, Mr. Zhang Haoruo, speaking at a meeting recently held by 
the ministry on an analysis of the economic situation in the 
internal trade sector in the country, stressed that the key task 
at present facing the ministry was to stabilize markets and 
prices in the country. All departments and units engaging in 
commodity circulation must take an earnest attitude to the 
inflation problem with special attention being paid to the 
stability of prices of important goods such as grain, edible 
oil, meat, sugar and chemical fertilizers. 
  The minister said that the national economic operations in 
the country in the first quarter this year was on the whole 
good. Some problems and difficulties, however, still appeared 
including the unsatisfactory sales of production means and a 
drop in economic results in enterprises specializing in 
commodity circulation. Some of these problems and difficulties 
resulted from certain temporary factors and were undergoing a 
solution through measures taken by relevant state departments. 
  Mr. Zhang called for departments and units under the 
ministry 
to keep a close eye on and analyze market changes and trends 
especially for important goods related to people's livelihood 
and at the same time adopt respective measures to control and 
regulate such changes and trends. 
  Mr. Zhang pointed out that the current work for the ministry 
was the purchase of summer grain and edible oil, the easing of 
supply of these products, the supply of chemical fertilizers, 
the earnest implementation of state price policies, prevention 
increased burdens imposed on farmers and the rectification of 
the market order of agricultural production means. [sentence as

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- In the process of 
further deepening the reform of its planning and investment 
system, China will exploit the advantages of both planning and 
market means to promote a sustained, high-speed and healthy 
development of the national economy. 
  Gui Shiyong, deputy minister of the State Planning 
Commission, said this in his speech at the opening of the "94 
China Beijing Senior Economic Seminar" here today. 
  Gui said that from now on the task of planning is to 
rationally define the strategies of national economic and social 
development, macro-control targets and industrial policies; 
carry out economic calculations; and draft plans for major 
economic structures, the arrangement of the productive forces 
and land management, and construction of key projects. 
  All economic activities which should be, or are qualified to 
be, regulated by the market, will be brought under market 
regulation, he added. 
  He said that the existing planning management style will be 
reformed, so as to realize the shift from direct control to 
indirect control, mainly using economic policies, regulations 
and other economic levers to guide the operation of the economy. 
  Gui said that China will also rationally define and perfect 
the economic management rights between the central and local 
governments. The unity and authority of macro-control by the 
central government should be guaranteed, while bringing the 
enthusiasm of local governments into full play, he stressed. 
  Meanwhile, he said, more attention should be paid to the 
participation of enterprises, market mediation organizations, 
scientific research units, universities, non-governmental 
organizations and other social circles in drafting plans. 
Efforts must be made to open planning work further, he said. 
  Gui said that the major contents of the reform of the 
investment system include the intensification of the investment 
risk restraining mechanism; the reform of the investment and 
fund-raising patterns; the reinforcement of macro-control on the 
investment volume and structure; and the establishment of 
policy-oriented investment and fund-raising systems by the 
central government and the State Development Bank.

<F P=106> [Article by Lin Zhiyuan (2651 1807 6678) of the Financial </F>
Research Institute of the People's Bank of China: "Conditions 
and Policies for the Reform of Convertibility of the 
Renminbi"--edited by Zhan Xiaohong (6124 1420 3163)] 
  [Text] Convertibility of the renminbi is one of the 
overall goals of China's financial reform. In 1989 China set up 
on an experimental basis official foreign exchange swap markets; 
in July 1993 the central bank intervened for the first time in 
the transactions of foreign exchange swap markets to stabilize 
exchange rates. These were important reform measures moving 
toward convertibility, but to put into immediate effect complete 
convertibility of the renminbi, we cannot but seriously estimate 
the growth of foreign trade, the state's foreign exchange 
reserves, and the ability of the central bank to raise and 
supplement foreign exchange reserves in time by making use of 
the whole banking system and the financial market. As in all 
developing countries, there exists in China serious financial 
constraint, and a backward banking system and erroneous policies 
are leading to serious capital outflow, obstructing the 
modernization process of domestic banking business and the 
financial market, and weakening the ability of the central bank 
to allocate and collect foreign exchange funds. In view of 
this, in the reform of convertibility of the renminbi, efforts 
should be made to overcome financial constraint, correct 
erroneous policies, and promote in an overall manner the 
internationalization development of commercial banks and the 
building of an international financial center inside China. 
<H5>  I. The Causes and Necessary Conditions for Convertibility of </H5>
the Renminbi 
  The nature of the system of convertibility of the renminbi 
is 
that the foreign exchange needed for the import and capital 
export of ordinary residents can be bought from banks at the 
market price without restriction. There are two basic reasons 
for giving up traditional foreign exchange controls and 
replacing them with convertibility of the renminbi: 1) Foreign 
exchange controls must be based on foreign trade controls, which 
directly impedes the development of foreign trade; so, foreign 
exchange controls must be abolished; 2) after the reform of 
decontrolling foreign trade and further opening to the outside 
world, the cost to the government of exercising foreign exchange 
controls goes up, and as it is also subject to breeding 
corruption, it is better to abolish it. There are fundamental 
differences between convertibility and foreign exchange 
controls, in each case as a part of the currency system. 
Convertibility uses the state's foreign exchange reserves under 
the control of the central bank as a policy means, and regulates 
exchange rates by taking foreign currencies out of the market 
and putting them in, and then proceeds to regulate import and 
export trade; as for foreign exchange controls, it is for the 
government to control import and export trade by administrative 
means to stabilize exchange rates and seek the stability and 
growth of reserves. World history has proved that to maintain 
sustained economic growth, a country must be supported by 
continuous expansion of foreign trade. To speed up and maintain 
sustained high-speed growth, China must remove the constraints 
on foreign trade and foreign exchange controls over the growth 
of foreign trade, and must therefore carry out the reform of 
convertibility of the renminbi. 
  The economic feature of convertibility is to regulate import 
and export trade and the flow of international capital by 
fluctuations in exchange rates; conversely, trade changes for 
other reasons and large amounts of capital flow which affect the 
supply and demand on the foreign exchange market will also give 
rise to drastic fluctuations in exchange rates. Big 
fluctuations in exchange rates have an extremely unfavorable 
impact: 1) They create difficulties in the calculation of 
commodity prices, and impede the development of import and 
export trade; 2) they give rise to instability in the domestic 
money market, and increase difficulty in money policy; 3) they 
harm public confidence in the renminbi, and affect the political 
situation of stability and unity. To avoid unfavorable 
influences, the central bank, in order to carry out reform, must 
first have the ability to regulate market supply and demand and 
achieve stability of exchange rates. Therefore, the key to 
success in reform does not lie in whether or not exchange rates 
can spontaneously regulate import and export trade and the flow 
of international capital, but in whether or not the central bank 
has the ability to overcome big fluctuations in exchange rates. 
At present, it is especially necessary for the central bank to 
have the ability to offset the impact on the foreign exchange 
market caused by unfavorable export and large amounts of capital 
outflow, thus fundamentally replacing the restraint of existing 
foreign trade and foreign exchange controls on foreign exchange 
demand for import and for capital export. 
  To realize full regulation of foreign exchange supply and 
demand by the central bank, and achieve the goal of stabilizing 
exchange rates, it is necessary to have three conditions: 1) 
Ample foreign exchange reserves, including spot and short-term 
foreign exchange supply the central bank can control, and 
general drawing rights and special drawing rights with the IMF. 
2) Ample foreign exchange funds-merging channels; that is, the 
ability of the central bank to borrow in good time foreign 
exchange funds at low cost from financial organizations at home 
and abroad and from foreign governments. 3) A developed 
international financial center and foreign exchange market 
available inside China, capable of absorbing foreign exchange 
funds to stay in a centralized manner in large commercial banks 
in China through various highly efficient foreign exchange 
settlement businesses, spot and futures foreign exchange 
transactions, and various kinds of high added-value index-linked 
foreign exchange services. 
  Foreign exchange reserve assets are low-interest or 
interest-free foreign currency creditors' rights, with very 
little interest income and very high risk in exchange rates. If 
increases in reserves come from increases in debts, then there 
are also expenses for the cost of interest to keep the reserves. 
Therefore, it is not the case that the more foreign exchange 
reserves the better. Current experienced international practice 
is to measure it according to import volume, because settlement 
of payment for goods in most international trade uses 
three-month term bills. It is generally believed, therefore, 
that an appropriate level of foreign exchange reserves should be 
equal to three months of total import volume. For countries 
with a large export volume and a favorable balance of payments 
in constant items, total import volume can be appropriately 
reduced; conversely, for countries with a small export volume 
and an unfavorable balance of payments, total import volume can 
be appropriately increased. China belongs to the latter, and an 
appropriate level of reserves should be equal to four or five 
months of total import volume. 
  Limited foreign exchange reserves for import can only meet 
the needs of normal trade settlement, and can in no way offset 
the impact of foreign trade fluctuations and capital outflow on 
the foreign exchange market. China is a country exercising 
strict import control. Once restrictions are released, and 
imports increase by a big margin, capital outflow increases with 
export trade. It is inevitable that the subsequent unfavorable 
balance of payments will affect the market. Therefore, the 
central bank must have ample foreign exchange funds-merging 
channels, and when market exchange rates are high, raise foreign 
exchange, increase bear sales, and press down exchange rates in 
time; and when market exchange rates are low, buy foreign 
exchange in time, and use it for repayment of debts or deposit 
it in commercial banks for the purpose of stabilizing exchange 
rates. At present, the channels through which the central bank 
of China may merge foreign exchange funds in a timely way 
include: 1) Self-run foreign exchange funds of the Bank of 
China; 2) small amounts of foreign exchange deposits absorbed by 
the Bank of Industry and Commerce, the Bank of Construction, and 
the Bank of Communications; 3) loans from IMF special drawing 
rights; 4) loans from the central banks, governments, and 
commercial banks of foreign countries. Among the above 
channels, only banks in China may possibly lend foreign exchange 
funds unconditionally in time, but the amounts are extremely 
limited; there is no limit to the amounts from other channels, 
but procedures are complicated, the cost is great, and the 
restrictive terms are extremely harsh. Therefore, taken as a 
whole, relative to the requirements for stabilizing market 
fluctuations, the ability of China's central bank at present to 
transfer foreign exchange funds and its funds-merging channels 
are still extremely limited and utterly insufficient. 
  Full convertibility requires not only that the central bank 
has the ability to regulate and control, but also that there is 
a kind of market buffer ability capable of automatically 
offsetting the impact of drastic movements of international 
capital, and therefore it is required to have a developed 
foreign exchange market and numerous large transnational banks 
to build up an international financial center inside China. 
Take Shanghai and Shenzhen for example: As the securities 
markets there are fairly developed and standardized, funds in 
China automatically flow toward Shanghai and Shenzhen. For the 
same reason, if there is a developed international financial 
center, it can draw funds from at home and abroad on an 
extensive basis to stay in banks inside China to produce a solid 
cushioning effect in foreign exchange supply and demand, and the 
central bank can also make full use of foreign exchange funds of 
large commercial banks to stabilize the drastic fluctuations of 
exchange rates. 
<H5>  II. Financial Constraint Policy and Trends of Capital </H5>
Outflow 
  Financial constraint refers to the fact that due to 
restraint 
by factors of history and system, the development of China's 
banking business is in an extremely unfavorable situation in the 
face of international competition. It presses capital to flow 
out, and leads to loss of foreign exchange and stagnation in the 
development of China's banking business. Experiences of some 
developing countries show that if there exists serious financial 
constraint, if they rashly carry out monetary reform of real 
convertibility, they often aggravate capital outflow, affect the 
foreign exchange market, and the result is failure in the 
reform. As in almost all developing countries, there are also 
serious financial constraints in China, specifically expressed 
in the following aspects: 
  1. The backward banking system. There were not a few 
developments in China's banking business in more than 10 years 
of reform. The central bank was organized, and many commercial 
banks were newly set up. However, the central bank did not 
fully control the means of financial management that fit the 
requirements of a market economy, but stuck to the restraint of 
the traditional planned credit system, limiting the number of 
newly established banks, limiting new businesses developed by 
banks, and restricting banks' free choice in the methods of 
credit and property mix to supplement capital by making use of 
the market. Under these restrictions, the financial management 
which took a leading position in commercial bank operations lost 
its significance, and therefore it was difficult to fully raise 
the level of operation and management and vocational skill, 
which finally impeded the growth of large international 
commercial banks and the birth of an international financial 
center, and also impeded the development of funds-merging 
channels overseas and the extensive absorption of foreign 
exchange funds. 
  2. The money market settlement system is extremely 
backward. A strictly standardized and highly efficient 
settlement system is the basis of the credit system of modern 
banks, and on that basis various kinds of high-tech financial 
innovation business can be done successfully, such as foreign 
exchange futures, futures rights, monetary funds, and money 
exchange to provide necessary services of money value-keeping 
and increment for foreign trade enterprises and investors. 
However, there is not yet a written law on negotiable 
instruments in China to serve as the basis of a monetary 
settlement system, and the rights and duties of creditors and 
debtors lack ample legal guarantees, which restricts the 
settlement technique in developing in the direction of safety 
and high efficiency. Backward settlement instruments plus 
low-service efficiency compel enterprises and investors to 
choose banks outside China to keep their foreign exchange 
position, or let enterprises outside China gratuitously occupy 
the short-term use of foreign exchange settlement funds, which 
delays foreign exchange earnings for export, and impedes the 
development and growth of a foreign exchange market inside China. 
  3. Strict foreign exchange controls increase the cost of 
foreign exchange. The reform of keeping part of foreign 
exchange earnings increases the power of foreign trade 
enterprises in using foreign exchange, but the existing planned 
distribution of foreign exchange quotas still strictly restricts 
the use of foreign exchange by various kinds of enterprises and 
ordinary residents, which increases the noncurrency cost of 
enterprises and residents in obtaining foreign exchange. It 
makes them feel that it is more convenient to keep foreign 
exchange themselves. Therefore, stimulation of foreign exchange 
demand is reflected in the market as exchange rates on the black 
market being artificially pushed up. In addition, the fixed 
exchange rates system and quota distribution make the whole 
foreign exchange settlement system become further extremely 
complicated, and compel foreign trade enterprises to choose 
constantly keeping large amounts of foreign exchange to provide 
against any contingency. Therefore, the demand for foreign 
exchange is artificially increased. 
  4. The capital market is small and backward, and investors 
look to overseas markets. At present, some enterprise 
corporations which have high management level and abundant funds 
still find it difficult to invest and develop through the 
capital market. They turn to look for overseas investments and 
capital export. 
  5. Erroneous money policies and revenue policies. Misled by 
theory, China practices a 100 percent reserve fund ratio 
requirement for financial deposits in commercial banks, and a 13 
percent reserve fund ratio for ordinary deposits. These two 
regulations cause the operational funds of commercial banks in 
China to be reduced by over 10 percent compared with banks 
outside China, virtually increasing the cost of funds. At the 
end of 1992, the People's Bank announced that the renminbi could 
be taken out of China, and foreign banks outside China started 
competing for renminbi settlement business, creating a powerful 
competitive momentum for banks inside China, and weakening the 
sources of foreign exchange funds from inside China. In 1993, 
the central bank, by administrative means, imposed on financial 
centers in coastal areas the purchase of funds-merging coupons, 
which further weakened the funds operation capacity of 
commercial banks, and stimulated banks in these areas to 
exchange funds for foreign exchange and transfer it outside 
China for operations, thus turning it into an outflow of 
financial capital. Moreover, a high tax rate policy for banks 
and low-wage policy for bank staff also at present make banks in 
China face the perplexity of backward technological equipment 
and loss of professional managerial staff. 
  The direct consequence of financial constraint is capital 
outflow, and the following statistical analysis shows China's 
present scale of capital outflow. 
  1. Foreign trade settlement funds have flowed out of China 
for a long time, estimated at $16.97 billion in 1992. Due to 
backwardness in the foreign exchange settlement system and the 
lack of necessary foreign exchange value-keeping services, 
China's foreign exchange receipts for export are generally 
delayed, and payment for import is basically made by spot 
exchange (payment upon delivery), and foreign exchange receipts 
for export are delayed for three months on average. For 
example, in 1992 imports amounted to $64.385 billion, and 
exports amounted to $69.567 billion. Supposing payment for 
imports was delayed for one month on average, and foreign 
exchange for exports was received two months ahead of schedule 
on average (53.65 = 643.85/12; 115.94 = 695.67/6; 169.6 = 53.65 
+ 115.94), with the two added together, China would have $16.96 
billion of settlement funds available for use, but due to the 
backwardness of the settlement system, it is now used by foreign 
businessmen, which is tantamount to capital outflow. 
  2. Short-term capital outflow is on average larger than 
capital inflow. According to international payment statistics, 
the net amounts of inflow and outflow of China's short-term 
assets items have been as shown in Table 1. Negative values in 
the Table are unfavorable short-term capital balances 
(outflow&gt; inflow), the largest being 31.98 (1990), the smallest 
9.06 (1992), while the largest favorable balance is only 3.62 
(1991). The sum total of favorable balances of various years 
added together is still lower than the smallest unfavorable 
balance. Therefore, the basic trend of short-term capital items 
is an unfavorable balance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  3. There is a trend of a progressive decrease in the 
favorable balance of long-term capital. It can be seen from 
Table 2 that the favorable balance of capital items increased 
year by year during the 1986-1988 period, and in 1989 started 
decreasing year by year, and an unfavorable balance appeared for 
the first time in 1992. It proves that China's capital outflow 
was expanding and the use of foreign capital was decreasing. 
Mid-term capital items reached a peak of $8.238 billion in 
1986, and subsequently presented a trend of fluctuation and 
decline. There was a slight upturn in 1988 and 1990, and it 
decreased drastically in 1991. This trend was basically 
identical with China's reform of the decontrolling of foreign 
trade, and with changes in enterprises setting up overseas 
organizations since 1990.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  4. Trade items changed from sustained unfavorable balance to 
sustained favorable balance. This change was identical with the 
trend of a progressive decrease in favorable balance in capital 
items. It showed that a part of exports was changed into 
overseas investments without foreign exchange income. Comparing 
the growth rate of imports with that of exports, imports were 
mainly constrained by planned quotas, artificial factors led to 
fluctuations in growth rate, and there was no inevitable 
connection with the trend of changes in trade items. Therefore, 
the trend of trade items was mainly determined by sustained 
export growth. From 1985 to 1992, there was a total export 
growth of 177 percent, and import growth of 68 percent. The 
difference between the two was the decrease in the use of 
foreign capital and the loss of foreign exchange funds.

  5. The escaping of foreign exchange funds. Table 4 includes 
items of errors and omissions in the balance of international 
payments, which shows the defects of the statistical system and 
the escaping of foreign exchange funds. If these were only 
statistical defects, the errors and omissions in various years 
should tend toward stability; if statistics were improved, the 
margin of fluctuations should be even smaller, and tend to be 
identical with the changes in trade items. However, the 
numerical values listed in the table are obviously to the 
contrary, which proves that there was escape of foreign exchange 
funds. Drastic fluctuations started in 1989, showing that the 
escape became serious, especially when it reached $8.419 
billion, amounting to 12.1 percent (84.19/695.67) of export 
volume. Supposing that errors and omissions caused by 
statistical defects amounted to an annual average 3 percent of 
exports, then the escape of capital in 1992 reached $6 billion 
(84.19 x (12.1 percent - 3 percent)/12.1). Added to the outflow 
of settlement funds, the total is $23 billion, exceeding 30 
percent of total export volume. According to international 
experience in the development of market economy, developed 
countries require the use of capital export as a means to open 
up, expand, and occupy overseas markets, and developing 
countries must also make use of this means in the face of fierce 
competition in overseas markets. According to the experience of 
the "four Asian dragons," with their high-speed economic 
development, there are three stages of change in capital items 
in international payments: In the early stage of economic 
development, there is a sustained favorable balance 
(import&gt; export) in capital items; when they get close to the 
take-off stage, both favorable and unfavorable balances of 
capital items will frequently appear alternately; when they 
reach the take-off stage and become an affluent society, there 
will appear a constant unfavorable balance in capital items. 
China is a developing country, and is extremely short of 
capital. It cannot but cause people anxiety that capital export 
should quicken in the early stage of economic development. 
Financial constraint leads to too early capital outflow, and if 
we do not speed up financial reform, try to remove financial 
constraint, and carry out the reform of convertibility of the 
renminbi, it will possibly lead to more serious capital outflow, 
and harm the development of China's financial market, the 
prosperity of the banking business, and sustained economic 
growth. A large amount of capital outflow affects the foreign 
exchange market, and the instability it causes may possibly 
finally lead to failure in convertibility.

  III. Proposals for Reform Measures 
  Once we make clear the relations of capital export to 
economic growth and financial constraint, in the face of 
inadequate foreign exchange reserves and capital outflow, our 
measures should emphatically be concerned with removing 
financial constraint and carrying out a step-by-step limited 
regulation of the renminbi exchange rate, so as to achieve 
success in the reform of convertibility of the renminbi. 
Specific proposals for measures to be taken include the 
following aspects: 
  1. Carry out all-round and in-depth financial reform, and 
overcome the restraint of the traditional planned system of 
centralized credit. In this respect, it requires replacing the 
current planned distribution of centralized credit with control 
of the quantity of money and overall financial supervision and 
management by the central bank, supervising and controlling 
banks' credit creation by the proportion of banks assets, and 
guiding and ensuring improvement in the overall quality of 
financial organizations by high-standard and scientific market 
admittance conditions, thus fundamentally overcoming the 
malpractices of the current system in one-sidedly emphasizing 
quantitative restrictions, making light of quality control, and 
using a single policy to deal with all kinds of problems; and 
quickening the healthy development of the financial business. 
  2. Promote the building of financial centers in an overall 
manner, and vigorously widen the financing channels at home and 
abroad. It is necessary to speed up the reform of specialized 
banks, urge them to face the market, and actively raise the 
management level; it is necessary to develop and organize many 
large transnational commercial banks, and encourage them to 
engage in foreign exchange settlement business and various kinds 
of foreign exchange value-keeping business of high added value, 
so as to speed up the expansion, escalation, and renovation of 
the foreign exchange market; it is necessary to speed up working 
out the law on negotiable instruments of an international 
standard, set up a specialized inter-bank clearing bank, and 
promote the progress of settlement technology and the healthy 
development of the money market; it is necessary to choose a 
large city which is an economic center with conditions to serve 
as an experiment in building an international financial center, 
absorb international short-term funds for long-term deposits, 
and develop in an overall manner financing channels at home and 
abroad for Chinese banks. 
  3. Improve policy operation, and heighten fully the 
competitive position of China's banking business. To improve 
policy operation at present, we must abolish the irrational 
regulation which requires a 100 percent reserve fund for 
financial deposits and, referring to international practice, we 
should reduce the legal reserve fund ratio to below 5 percent, 
and reduce banks' income tax rate to below 20 percent, so that 
the cost of funds of Chinese banks will be reduced and come 
close to the general international level; [Footnote 1: The 
results of practice prove that the regulation on reserve funds 
for financial deposits is not conducive to the control of money 
quantity. That banks by every possible means change general 
deposits into financial deposits leads to the distortion of bank 
behavior and a lack of fidelity in statistics, disadvantageous 
to macroeconomic regulation and control. Such a policy is 
brought about purely by misleading theory, and must therefore be 
abolished. The reserve fund ratio of general deposits is 3 
percent in the United States, and 0.5 percent in the United 
Kingdom, and in recent years many Asian countries have also 
greatly reduced the reserve fund ratio. As for banks' income 
tax rate, for Swiss banks it is below 10 percent, and it is 
about 5 percent in Hong Kong.] we must fully decontrol the 
stipulation of wages for bank staff, and allow banks to increase 
by a big margin the wages of their technological grade staff, so 
as to promote the training and reduce the loss of senior 
managerial staff; it is necessary to improve the issue of 
funds-merging coupons, replace fixed-interest-rate purchase 
imposed administratively with the principle of voluntary 
purchase, set up securities buy-back arrangements, and reduce 
restrictions on banks' use of funds; it is necessary to 
standardize and develop the inter-bank market, and strengthen 
the central bank's regulation of interest rates and funds of the 
inter-bank market; it is necessary to allow commercial banks to 
choose methods of fund-raising according to the principles of 
minimum cost, timely sources, and longest duration, and to 
choose the methods of loans and property mix according to the 
principle of maximum profit, minimum risk, and full mobility, 
and abolish the present various irrational restrictions on 
banks' methods of fund-raising, methods of lending, and property 
mix to enable them to truly become commercial banks. 
  4. Speed up the building of the capital market, improve its 
organizational structure, reduce its transaction costs and 
information costs, and quicken the development of the securities 
business, so as to promote the process of enterprise reform. It 
is necessary to allow banks to make use of the capital market to 
cast off the historical burden of idle loans by securitization 
and capitalization of debts, speed up reform, and become large 
modern commercial banks. It is necessary to widen the capacity 
and range of the capital market, create channels for taking in 
and putting out huge amounts of funds for the development of 
large, newly emerging enterprises and the building of the 
state's key projects, encourage active absorption in multiple 
forms of capital at home and overseas, and reduce as far as 
possible early loss of home capital. 
  5. Practice limited regulation of exchange rates in steps, 
and have a gradual transition to convertibility of the renminbi. 
Based on the progress of financial reform and the extent of 
gradual widening of market funds-merging channels, the reform of 
convertibility of the renminbi should be promoted beginning now 
in three steps. The first step: Implement limited regulation 
according to existing amounts of foreign exchange reserves, and 
with the average exchange rates of the previous three years as 
the central target, allow 20 percent market exchange rate 
fluctuations, carry out regulation when this range is exceeded, 
and retain some foreign exchange controls. The second step: 
Make full use of the strength of foreign exchange funds of 
commercial banks in China, and borrow funds from international 
financial organizations for exchange rate regulation. Keep the 
exchange rate fluctuations within the range of 5 percent above 
or below the central rate, and carry out a small degree of 
crawling devaluation of the renminbi against major international 
currencies. Gradually remove planned quota distribution of 
foreign exchange, and stop the issue of new foreign exchange 
coupons. The third step: Under the circumstances that banking 
reform is basically in position and that the international 
financial center inside China is built on a preliminary basis, 
carry out reforms toward a unified market, full regulation, and 
maintenance of a stable exchange rate. By a unified market is 
meant unifying and merging into one the current official parity 
foreign exchange market, the foreign exchange quota swap market, 
and the free transaction market among the people, unifying 
standards, and realizing a unitary market in which the renminbi 
is fully convertible. Through exchange rate regulation, it is 
necessary to keep the fluctuations within the range of 2.5 
percent above or below the central rate, coordinate with 
domestic economic policies, carry out unlimited buying and 
selling, and achieve basic stability of exchange rates. Based 
on China's present level of foreign exchange reserves and market 
funds-merging conditions, we can only carry out the first-step 
reform of limited regulation in one or two years, but we must 
speed up financial reform, actively create conditions for a 
higher goal, and finally realize full convertibility of the 
renminbi.

  [Text] The trading hall of the Shenzhen Metals Exchange 
(SME), on the first floor of an ordinary commercial building on 
Huafu Road, was bustling with activity. A number of young 
people wearing red vests concentrated their attention on the 
continuous flow of market quotations and transactions which 
flashed across the 5x2.5 meter electronic screen. While the 
exchange had only been open for 15 minutes, the transaction 
volume totalled 1,200 tons of electrolytic copper, with each 
transaction falling between 100 to 200 tons. 
  According to SME President Zheng Yuanheng, SME's total 
transaction volume in 1993 exceeded the planned figure of 20 
billion yuan by a substantial margin, reaching 38 billion yuan, 
a 6.5-fold increase over the previous year. 
  "The exchange was jointly established by 38 enterprises on 
June 1, 1991, and began formal operations on January 18, 1992," 
Zheng said. "The business volume for 1992 reached 6.3 billion 
yuan, far exceeding the planned figure of 1 billion yuan." 
<H5>  Standardization </H5>
  China initiated research and investigation of futures 
markets 
in the mid-80s. Peng Haike, director of the General Manager's 
Office of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Shenzhen 
Associated Corp., said his company began investigating 
international futures trading in 1985, and succeeded in carrying 
out hedging transactions on the London Metals Exchange in 1987. 
People were later sent to the London Metals Exchange to pursue 
indepth research and investigations. They gained an in-depth 
understanding of the requirements for establishing a futures 
market to boost the rapid development of China's market economy. 
  At that particular time, China was shifting from a planned 
economy to a market economy, and futures trading was something 
completely new for both enterprise leaders and officials. Situ 
Huai, president of the China Nonferrous Industry Shenzhen 
Associated Corp., who concurrently serves as a professor at the 
South-Central China Engineering University, wrote a book 
entitled An Introduction to Futures Business. His intent was to 
provide information and promote futures trading. According to 
Situ, "The first step is to help people in the economic sector 
understand futures trading and to train professionals. As a 
result, from the very beginning China's futures trading will 
operate under a standardized system." 
  The Shenzhen Metals Exchange opened for business on January 
18, 1992, following a long preparatory period. Prior to the 
opening, the Shenzhen municipal government issued its 
Provisional Regulations on Administration of the Shenzhen Metals 
Exchange and Regulations on Transactions in the Shenzhen Metals 
Exchange. Executives from major futures exchanges in countries 
and regions such as the United States, Britain, Japan, Canada, 
Singapore and Hong Kong attended the opening ceremony. Filled 
with zest, they visited the transaction hall which had been 
operating on a trial basis, and expressed their appreciation for 
the standardized operations, while at the same time offering 
high praise for the establishment of the exchange. 
  Futures trading, which represents the top end of the market, 
features major risk and heavy speculation. Therefore, 
activities must be governed by laws and regulations. The 
Shenzhen Metals Exchange, the first of its kind in China, must 
be operate with high standards and proceed on a steady course. 
It must be strictly managed in accordance with international 
practices. According to Zheng Yuanheng, this has been the 
guiding ideology from the very beginning. 
  The SME practices a membership system. Members must be 
enterprises with relatively strong economic strength and which 
employ professionals. The enterprises, which seek membership on 
a voluntary basis, are examined by the board of directors and 
approved by competent authorities of the local government. Only 
members are qualified to appoint personnel as brokers, and all 
brokers are required to pass an examination prior to receiving 
working credentials. The number of members has risen from the 
initial 38 to the present 110. Most large-scale nonferrous 
metals enterprises in China are members, in addition to various 
commercial and marketing enterprises, processing enterprises, 
and financial and investment institutions. 
  The exchange operates five days a week, and on any given 
day, 
brokers in red vests busily complete vouchers containing the 
selling and purchasing prices of commodities, which are then 
displayed on the screen. At present, eight metals--copper, 
aluminum, lead, zinc, tin, nickel, magnesium and antimony have 
been approved for listing for either one-month spot or one-year 
futures trading. The exchange's accounting center is 
responsible for all settlements. 
  The Anhui Tongling Nonferrous Metals Corp. appointed Ma Ji, 
26, a graduate of the Economics Department of Anhui University, 
as one of the first brokers on the Shenzhen Metals Exchange. Ma 
said that in the beginning business was far from brisk, but has 
increased steadily as people have gained a better understanding 
of the new business form. He noted that large production 
enterprises mainly engage in hedging transactions in order to 
lock-in costs to protect them from volatile market prices, and 
show little interest in profit-making. For example, the price 
for electrolytic copper on the international market was recently 
lower than the domestic price, with a substantial price 
difference of 1,000 yuan per ton. As a result, his corporation 
imported copper from foreign countries while selling reserves on 
the domestic market. Shortly thereafter, the domestic price 
fell, as did the price on the international market. Ma's company 
was nonetheless able to earn a profit. Today, the corporation 
allows Ma to personally make decisions to conduct transactions 
involving less than 1,000 tons. In addition to his work for the 
corporation, Ma also serves as a broker for various other 
enterprises. At present, each broker working on the exchange 
handles accounts at least five enterprises [as published]. 
  Liang Xiaohua, a female broker working for an aluminum alloy 
processing plant in Sanshui City, Guangdong Province, said that 
futures transactions may be hedging, but nonetheless ensure a 
steady supply of goods. Strict rules and regulations instituted 
by the exchange ensure that payments will be made in a timely 
manner, and Liang said her company dare not undertake major 
futures trade due to limited operating funds and loans. Liang, 
who also works as broker for more than 10 other companies, finds 
her job quite interesting since she is able to learn a great 
deal from the exchange, while at the same time enhancing her 
judgment and developing a sense of competition. 
  In the very beginning, Liang said, she was much too 
nervous to work well, and other brokers nearby often helped her 
correct mistakes. However, only two short years practice has 
transformed her into a skilled broker. At present, females 
account for only 10 percent of the total number of brokers. 
  According to Zheng Yuanheng, the key to futures trading is 
designing standardized contracts for commodities, since 
contracts ensure that products must be traded in accordance with 
circulation standards and help to prevent switch selling. In 
addition, contracts not only help to increase business volume 
but also guarantee day of delivery. In 1992, the SME joined wit 
production, use and quality inspection departments to adopt a 
special-class standardized aluminum contract in line with 
current international standards. The contract, China's first 
ever for a commodity, was revised and used in trial operations 
prior to its formal adoption on April 26, 1993. Shortly 
thereafter, similar contracts were adopted for copper, zinc, tin 
and nickel. 
  Zheng said aluminum and copper contracts have distinctly 
strengthened the circulation of commodities and attracted a 
large number of firms engaged in hedging and profit-making. As 
a result there has been a significant increase in business 
volume, up five fold per month over the previous period. At 
present, all transactions consummated on the exchange have been 
subject to standardized contracts and the rate of evening up has 
increased by a large margin to near 90 percent. The strict 
administrative system has ensured that the contract fulfillment 
rate has remained at 100 percent since the founding of the SME. 
  The SME has invested several million yuan to install 
state-of-the-art telecommunications and computer systems. In 
addition, the exchange has installed 225 program-control 
telephones, and a new long-distance business transmission system 
links it with some 10 other exchanges. The number will soon be 
expanded to include another 20-odd exchanges both at home and 
abroad. The exchange is now linked with the Reuters Information 
Network which transmits market information worldwide. In 
addition, the network provides the exchange with rapid access to 
international market quotations published by Reuters. At the 
same time, negotiations are underway with United Press 
International and the Satellite Communications Corp. Market 
quotations from the SME are regularly published in more than 10 
domestic newspapers and periodicals. And some local newspapers 
and magazines publish a weekly market outlook, and broadcasting 
and television stations carry daily quotations. 
<H5>  Development With Chinese Conditions </H5>
  SME's effort to develop a futures market has included paying 
close attention to the unique characteristics in China. For 
instance, in consideration of the country's true conditions and 
resources, SME introduced antimony and magnesium to the futures 
market thereby setting a worldwide precedent. The exchange's 
settlement system requires the payment of earnest money 
representing only 3 percent of the total transaction volume. 
The intentionally low figure, which is in fact far below the 
international practice of some 10 percent, is designed to 
encourage enterprises lacking abundant excess funds to actively 
participate in the market and conduct large-scale business with 
small-scale funds. 
  Following the lead of the SME, the Shanghai Metals Exchange 
went into operation in May that same year, and within a very 
short period its transaction far surpassed that of the SME. By 
exerting price guidance on production, consumption and 
circulation and using forward pricing, the exchanges have played 
an important role in regulating market supply and demand, and 
stabilizing market prices. The consumption surge resulting from 
the dramatic expansion of basic construction between 1988 and 
1989 pushed the prices of aluminum, copper and nickel up by from 
2.5 to 3-fold in a very short period of time. During 1992 and 
1993, domestic basic construction was once again expanded and 
the prices for rolled steel and various other raw materials not 
yet listed on futures market increased by a wide margin, while 
prices for aluminum and copper maintained relative stability due 
to the regulatory function of the futures market. 
  Zheng said that when materials are in short supply on the 
domestic market and prices rise, the majority of members of the 
exchange purchase on the international market and sell on the 
exchange, thereby bringing about a balance in supply and demand 
and stable prices. 
  In accordance with open and just principles, all business 
transactions are carried out publicly, rapidly and in simple 
procedures. This particular form of business has gained great 
has popularity amongst the majority of enterprises, especially 
large enterprises. Ma Ji said most of his company's business 
are transacted on the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges, adding 
that the company has opened two futures trading companies in 
Shenzhen and Shanghai in order to act as large-scale trade 
agents. 
  The success of the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges has 
ignited a fervor for the establishment of additional futures 
markets. By the end of 1993, the number of various types of 
futures exchanges rose to more than 40, 11 of which were 
nonferrous metals exchanges. In the interim period some have 
been forced close because of low standards. 
  Speaking of future development, Zheng said the SME is still 
in the midst of a period of growth and self-perfection. Last 
December, based on the SME, the Futures Integrated Exchange was 
established to expand the scale of the industry to include 
banking futures and option trading.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- Consumer markets in our 
country have shown steady signs of brisk growth since the 
beginning of this year. During the first quarter, the total 
retail volume of consumer goods amounted to 352.24 billion yuan, 
up 25.2 percent from last year's corresponding period. After 
being adjusted for price increases, the sale volume rose 5 
percent in real terms, thus maintaining the strong momentum of 
steady growth. 
  Consumer markets in our country are well stocked this year. 
According to a breakdown of consumer goods based on an analysis 
of supply and demand by relevant departments, supply and demand 
are basically balanced for 58.7 percent of the 726 major 
commodities, whereas the supply of 29.7 percent of the 
commodities outstrips demand. Sales of various brand-name, 
special, and new products have increased sharply. In the food 
category, brand-name foods and beverages, as well as fresh fruit 
and aquatic products, have enjoyed extremely brisk sales. Among 
clothing and accessories, brisk sales of cashmere and fur 
clothing, underwear, and leather shoes have continued unabated. 
Among daily necessities, the sale volume of home electrical 
appliances has increased 30 percent or more in some areas when 
compared to last year's corresponding year. Sales of cameras, 
videocassette recorders, and some small home electrical 
appliances have consistently been strong. 
  As urban and rural markets go, last year's vast disparity 
between consumer markets in urban and rural areas has begun to 
narrow as consumer markets in rural markets have grown more 
rapidly. Increases in peasants' incomes have somewhat improved 
purchasing power. During the first quarter, the retail sales 
volume of consumer goods at or below the county level totaled 
142.5 billion yuan, up 22.3 percent from last year's 
corresponding period. The retail sales volume of consumer goods 
in the cities was 209.8 billion yuan, up 27.3 percent from last 
year's same period. Hainan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and 
Tianjin are among the regions which posted increases of 30 
percent or more in their total retail sales volumes of consumer 
goods.

counterfeit and low quality products. 
  Some 954 of medium and small-sized enterprises were 
examined, 
making up 82.5 percent of the total enterprises looked at. Of 
these, only 63.7 percent of the products were found to meet the 
standards and only 62.7 percent of township enterprise products 
were found to meet the standards, and at the same time, the 
production of counterfeit and low quality products remained 
serious.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- China's rural firms had 
an output worth 474 billion yuan in the first quarter of this 
year -- a 47 percent growth over the same period of last year, 
said the Ministry of Agriculture. 
  The ministry officials said this formed a sharp contrast 
with 
the state-owned sector, which chalked up a growth of only 2.2 
percent during the first three months. 
  The officials estimated that rural industries will have an 
annual growth of 25 percent to 30 percent this year. 
  Meanwhile, rural firms have seen a remarkable improvement in 
their product quality, thanks to an investment of more than 100 
billion yuan in fixed assets last year, mainly for improving 
manufacturing technology. 
  Facing market competition that is getting fiercer and 
fiercer, the rural firms have been improving their management 
and adopting a flexible market policy, the officials noted. 
  In the first quarter of this year rural firms sold more than 
83 percent of the products made during that period, making a 
sales income of 395 billion yuan. 
  In the first three months the exports of rural firms 
skyrocketed by 72 percent over the same period of last year, to 
reach 48.5 billion yuan. 
  According to the officials, rural firms now employ one tenth 
of the nation's population. In 1993 alone the number of their 
employees increased by six million. 
  The officials said they expect that rural firms will be able 
to absorb more surplus rural labor. The government estimates 
that China will have five million more people in need of jobs by 
the end of this year. 
  The officials said rural firms in Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan and 
Sichuan Provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region 
showed the fastest growth in the first quarter. 
  Rural industrial enterprises in east China reported a 50 
percent growth in the first three months, three percentage 
points higher than the national average in the same period, the 
officials added.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (YONHAP) -- The Chinese Government 
on Thursday [12 May] denied some reports that China has been 
arranging behind the curtain a summit meeting between the two 
Koreas. 
  In a weekly press interview here, Wu Jianmin, Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, said China does not need to mediate between 
South and North Korea inasmuch as there is a dialogue channel 
between the two Koreas. 
  "The Chinese Government wishes to see South and North Korea 
resolve their problems through their direct and constructive 
dialogue and negotiations," Wu said. 
  Asked to comment on the report of North Korea's acceptance 
of 
nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), Wu said he heard nothing about it. 
  He added, however, that if the report were true, it could be 
a welcome news. "It is in accord with China's consistent policy 
that problems should be settled through dialogue and 
negotiations between direct parties involved," he said. 
  On the remarks allegedly made by a senior U.S. State 
Department official to the effect that China had assisted in 
North Korea's missile system and nuclear development, Wu 
rejected it as an "irresponsible and totally unfounded 
allegation."

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here today that China appreciates 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's attitude toward the 
history of Japan's aggression against China, saying that his 
attitude is sensible and is in accordance with the trend of 
history. 
  Commenting on the letter from Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu 
Hata to Chinese leaders here this afternoon at the weekly press 
conference, the spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said that on May 10, 
Japanese Ambassador to China Kunihiro Michihiko conveyed to 
Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan a message from Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata to Chinese Premier Li Peng on the remarks 
made by former Japanese minister of justice, Shigeto Nagano, in 
which Nagano distorted the history of Japan's aggression against 
China. 
  "We have taken note of the profound introspection expressed 
by Prime Minister Hata that Japan's aggression and colonial rule 
in the past have inflicted unbearable suffering on many 
peoples," Wu said. 
  In the letter, the Japanese prime minister promised that 
history shall be treated correctly and the young generation 
shall be educated with the correct historical views and 
determined to prevent the past unfortunate history form being 
repeated. 
  "This attitude of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is sensible 
and 
is in accordance with the trend of history. We appreciate 
that," said the spokesman.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The remark made by the 
U.S. Assistant Secretary Winston Lord at the Senate Subcommittee 
of Foreign Relations is totally groundless, said a Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman here today. 
  At a weekly press conference here this afternoon, Spokesman 
Wu Jianmin made the statement when asked to comment on a report 
that on May 4, Lord indicated at the Senate Subcommittee of 
Foreign Relations that China in the past possibly aided the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ballistic missile 
program, and surely helped its nuclear program. 
  Wu said "such a remark is totally groundless and entirely 
irresponsible".

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Viktor Stepanovich 
Chernomyrdin, prime minister of the Government of Russian 
Federation, will pay an official visit to China from May 26 to 
29, at the invitation of Chinese Premier Li Peng. 
  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman announced this at a 
weekly news briefing here this afternoon. 
  Wu Jianmin, the spokesman, said this will be the first China 
visit made by a Russian prime minister, to which the Chinese 
side attaches great importance. 
  In general, Wu noted, the Sino-Russian relations in various 
fields, with the joint efforts by both sides, have achieved 
positive progress since Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited 
China in December 1992. 
  The purpose of the coming visit by the Russian prime 
minister 
is to "promote the steady and sustained development of bilateral 
relations on the basis of the achievements already made, 
especially to further promote the two countries' economic and 
trade cooperation", the spokesman said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here today that long-term exclusion of China from the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is beneficial 
neither to China nor to the rest of the world. 
  Meeting with some of the participants of the '94 China 
Summit 
Meeting, which opened here today, Li Peng stressed that China is 
willing to resume its contracting status in GATT at an early 
date and become one of the founding members of the future World 
Trade Organization (WTO), adding that China has made many 
efforts to this end. 
  He said that the relations between China and GATT or even 
the 
future WTO are mutually beneficial. China needs multi-lateral 
trade organizations like GATT while GATT and the future WTO also 
need China. 
  If China, a country with over 1.1 billion people and a 
rapidly growing economy and trade volume, is barred from entry 
into GATT, it is hard to say that such a World Trade 
Organization is an integral one, he said. 
  The Chinese premier also briefed the participants on the 
characteristics and contents of China's socialist market 
economic system, the situation of the state-owned major and 
middle-sized enterprises, the efforts China has made to handle 
the relations between reform, development and stability as well 
as the measures adopted to deepen the reform and strengthen 
macro-control. 
  He pointed out that for China development is the purpose, 
reform is the motive force and stability is the condition. 
  Later on Li Peng hosted a banquet in honor of all the 
participants at the '94 China Summit Meeting at the Great Hall 
of the People. 
  Li said that China is a peace-loving country. The 
establishment of economic construction as the central task and 
the introduction of reform and opening policies advocated by 
Deng Xiaoping at the end of the 1970s have brought tremendous 
changes to China, he noted. 
  He continued that currently China is enjoying political 
stability, economic development, unity among its nationalities 
and social progress. "We have never been so confident in the 
future of our country," Li stressed. 
  Owing to its large population and less-developed economy, 
however, China has a long way to go in this respect, Li said. 
To develop its economy rapidly, China needs the long-time 
cooperation of the international community. 
  "We sincerely hope that our foreign friends all over the 
world will cooperate and exchange with us in capital, 
technology, management and other aspects," he said. 
  The country is a huge market and open to all countries that 
are willing to develop friendly cooperation with it, he noted. 
  China is willing to learn about the rest of the world and 
the 
rest of the world needs to learn about China, he said. This end 
is surely attainable, judging from all the speeches at today's 
meeting. 
  The summit meeting has dealt not only with China's economy, 
but with the world economy and its long-term development. 
"Peace and development are the common task we are faced with," 
Li told the gathering. 
  Asia, East Asia in particular, boasts the most energetic 
economic growth in the world and has a bright future, Li said. 
  He expressed the hope that the summit meeting would be held 
annually or every other year in his country and pledged it full 
support from the Chinese government. 
  In his speech, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad 
praised new changes he had witnessed in Beijing since his visit 
here last year. This has resulted from the hard work of the 
Chinese leadership, the government and the people, he said. 
  Mahathir voiced his appreciation of China's achievements. 
  The prosperity of China is sure to bring about prosperity to 
East Asia and the rest of the whole region, Mahathir said. He 
wished the Chinese people more achievements in their national 
construction. 
  Among those participating in today's meeting and banquet 
were 
Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of the Federal Republic of 
Germany, the World Bank's Managing Director Ernest Stern, and 
Richard McLean, publisher of the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE. 
  Li Tieying, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge 
of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, was also 
present at the occasion.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li 
Peng said here today that ousting China from GATT for a long 
time is detrimental [bu li yu 0008 0448 0060] not only to China 
but also to the world. 
  While meeting with some Chinese and foreign delegates to the 
1994 international high-level economic forum in Beijing, China, 
that opened today, Li Peng stressed: China is willing to resume 
its status as a GATT contracting member at an early date and to 
become a founding member of the future World Trade Organization 
[WTO], and China has made great efforts in this regard. 
  Li Peng said: China will maintain two-way relations with the 
currently existing GATT and with the future WTO. China needs 
multilateral trading organizations like GATT, while GATT and the 
future WTO also need China. 
  He said: If the WTO refuses to admit China -- a country with 
over 1.1 billion people and a rapidly developing economy and 
expanding trade volume, it will be very hard to regard the WTO 
as a wholesome organization. 
  During the meeting, Li Peng also briefed the delegates on 
the 
characteristics and contents of China's socialist market 
economy; on the conditions of China's large and medium state 
enterprises; on China's efforts in handling relations among 
reform, development, and stability; and on measures taken to 
deepen reform and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and 
control. 
  Li Peng said: After 15 years' practice and exploration, 
China has proposed the objective of establishing a socialist 
market economy. In the process, China will pay attention to 
properly handling the relations among reform, development, and 
stability. 
  He pointed out: Development is the purpose; reform, the 
driving force; and stability, the condition. 
  Later, Premier Li Peng hosted a banquet for all forum 
delegates at the Great Hall of the People. He said in his 
speech: He was very happy to be with distinguished guests and 
friends in Beijing at a time of bright sunshine, gentle breezes, 
and blooming flowers. 
  Li Peng said: China is a peace-cherishing country. 
Initiated by Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of the reform and 
opening up, China has formulated, as early as the end of the 
seventies, the general policy regarding economic construction as 
the central task and has been implementing policies of reform 
and opening up. Such efforts have brought tremendous changes to 
China. 
  He said: Currently, China is enjoying political stability, 
economic development, unity among its nationalities, and social 
progress. Full of hope and under the CPC leadership with Jiang 
Zemin as the core, the Chinese people are moving toward the 
21st century and the future. We are full of confidence in our 
country's future as never before. 
  However, Li Peng added: Owing to its large population and 
underdeveloped economy, China still has a long way to go. To 
develop its economy as rapidly as possible, China needs the 
international community's long-term support and cooperation. 
  He said: "We enthusiastically welcome foreign friends all 
over the world to cooperate and exchange with China in funds, 
technology, management, and many other fields." 
  Li Peng said: China is a huge market, open to all countries 
willing to develop friendly cooperation with it. 
  He said: China is willing to understand the world and the 
world also needs to understand China. Judging from the forum's 
speeches, this objective is definitely attainable. 
  Li Peng said: The meeting's agenda concerns not only China's 
economy, but also the world's economy and its long-term 
development. That is why we said: "Our common tasks are to 
attain peace and development." 
  Li Peng believed: Asia, including China and particularly 
East Asia, is the most active region in the world economy [shi 
jie jing ji zui wei huo yue de di qu 0013 3954 4842 3444 2584 
3634 3172 6460 4104 0966 0575] and has a very bright future. 
Therefore, he expressed the hope that after the forum ends in 
Beijing, similar international high-level forums will be held 
annually or every other year in China, adding that the Chinese 
Government is willing to provide effective support in this 
regard. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir delivered an ebullient 
speech at the banquet. He hailed new changes in Beijing since 
his last visit to China in 1993. He said these have been the 
results of efforts made by China's leaders, government, and 
people. 
  He said: "It is hard to administer a country with more than 
10 million people, not to mention one with more than 1.1 billion 
people." He added: As an Asian, he admires China's 
achievements. 
  Mahathir said: China's prosperity is sure to bring about 
prosperity in East Asia and in the whole of Asia. He wished 
that the Chinese people will accomplish more in their future 
construction. 
  Attending the meeting and banquet were Helmut Schmidt, 
former 
chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany; Ernest Stern, 
deputy managing director of the World Bank; and Richard McLean, 
chairman of the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE. 
  Li Tieying, state councillor and minister in charge of the 
State Economic Restructuring Commission, also attended the 
meeting and banquet.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Peter Sutherland, 
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), said here today that he confides in the prospect of 
early completion of the negotiations on the terms and conditions 
for China's rejoining GATT. 
  "China's ambitious program of trade and economic reforms has 
contributed greatly to bringing China more closely into line 
with the world trading system," he told the 1994 China summit 
meeting which opened here today. 
  In his speech entitled "Global Multilateral Trading System: 
The Role of the People's Republic of China," he said that 
observing the Chinese economy in the process of reform, one 
could see that China is essentially doing "autonomously" what 
the world trade organization would in any case oblige it to do. 
  "China is to be congratulated on its most recently announced 
program of liberalization and reform," he said, since "China's 
economic reforms have given a far greater role to market forces 
and have led to a rapid liberalization of its foreign trade 
regime. 
  "I am sure that producers, traders and consumers the world 
over, including those in China, are keen to see full 
implementation of these and other announced reforms." 
  He said that given the magnitude of China's economy and the 
likelihood that China would assume a leading role in shaping the 
global economic environment of the next century, it was of 
critical importance that close attention be paid to the manner 
in which China proceeds with its full integration into the world 
trade organization.

<F P=106> [By Giles Hewitt] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (AFP)--GATT chief Peter Sutherland 
warned China Wednesday that its bid to rejoin the world trade 
body was threatened by doubts over transparency and the threat 
to withdraw privileged access for Chinese exports to the U.S. 
market. 
  "There is a whole range of areas where more transparency is 
sought," Sutherland said, citing concerns among GATT members 
over the uniform administration of its foreign trade regime, 
especially in the area of import quotas, licences and standards. 
  "I believe that China would be well advised to take these 
concerns seriously," said Sutherland, who held talks on the 
membership issue Tuesday with Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi and 
other senior officials. 
  China, which was a founder member of GATT but left after the 
communists came to power in 1949, has made it clear that it 
attaches great political significance to being readmitted before 
GATT is replaced by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) on 
January 1. 
  While such a timeframe is possible, Sutherland told 
reporters 
that it would be a "difficult task." 
  "It depends ultimately on the willingness ... of the Chinese 
side to be immediately responsive to the concerns about 
transparency and other issues and for the rest of the world to 
respond rapidly to the political demand made by China for early 
accession." 
  He also pointed out that the WTO provides precise guidelines 
as to the types of instruments -- such as import quotas and 
tariffs -- that governments may resort to in pushing individual 
economic and trade priorities. 
  "Transparency is the only vehicle by which multilateral 
scrutiny of such instruments can be achieved. And full 
transparency is the basis on which China's request for 
resumption will be judged," he said. 
  Another serious obstacle to early re-entry is the ongoing 
Sino-U.S. row over China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status, 
which Washington has threatened to withdraw in June unless 
significant progress is made in China's human rights record. 
  If MFN is withdrawn, "it may signal difficulties vis-a-vis 
the conclusion of China's entry to the WTO," Sutherland said. 
  Because MFN is an "important principle" within the GATT, 
"the 
U.S. attitude, as a major contracting party to the Chinese 
integration into the world economy, will be of considerable 
importance to the conclusion of the negotiations for China's 
full accession into the WTO." 
  That attitude "will be signalled one way or another by 
events 
in the MFN issue," he added. 
  On the Chinese side, Wu Yi warned Sutherland that without 
Chinese participation, the WTO would be "incomplete and lack 
universality." 
  In a policy speech made later Wednesday to an international 
symposium, Wu insisted that China had in fact made "remarkable" 
progress in improving market access and engineered a 
"considerable rise of transparency in its foreign trade regime." 
  China has complained that it has not received adequate 
recognition for its trade liberalisation programme and that the 
requirements laid down by some GATT members for readmission 
could not be met without jeopardising the reform process. 
  However, while praising China's "real commitment," 
Sutherland 
stressed that GATT membership could not be granted on a basis 
which erodes any of the fundamental principles of the 
multilateral trading system. 
  "Therefore there is a responsibility on the part of China to 
show flexibility and to give adequate assurances" that would 
address the concerns of GATT members. 
  In effect, the deadline for concluding the current 
negotiations is much closer than December, with the GATT looking 
for a protocol agreement on China's re-entry to be reached 
before the next GATT Working Party on China talks scheduled for 
late June. 
  "In order to have any realistic possibility of concluding 
this negotiation in time, that protocol and agreement as to the 
terms of the protocol must be a priority," Sutherland said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing told the 1994 China summit meeting that since China has 
entered the new stage of comprehensively establishing its 
socialist economic system, it is necessary for it to cement its 
exchanges with the outside world. 
  About 600 people from abroad and at home attended the 
opening 
ceremony of the meeting, which was co-sponsored by the China 
State Commission for Restructuring Economic Systems (SCRES) and 
THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE. Among them were Mahathir 
Mohamed, Malaysian prime minister, Peter Sutherland, 
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, and 
Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of Germany. 
  Li Lanqing stressed in his speech that China is advancing 
toward its second goal in its economic and social development 
drive and establishment of a new socialist market economy. 
  "At the moment," he said, "the holding of this important 
summit meeting will provide a multi-layer contact opportunity 
for high- ranking Chinese and foreign officials, entrepreneurs 
and economists to discuss economic theories and practices in the 
contemporary world and China." 
  For this reason, he added, Chinese Government departments 
related to the economy will introduce their position with regard 
to the establishment of the socialist market economy, economic 
development, and reform and development measures put forward 
recently, so the delegates can obtain a full understanding of 
today's China. 
  The vice-premier also gave a briefing on China's economic 
situation. 
  In his speech entitled "Global Multilateral Trading System: 
the Role of the People's Republic of China", Sutherland said 
that momentous developments are taking place in China along with 
the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round world trade 
negotiations, and prior to the set-up of the new World Trade 
Organization. 
  "China is to be congratulated on its most recently announced 
programs of liberalization and reform, particularly those 
relating to the exchange regime, taxation, state trading, 
licensing, tariffs and non-tariff measures," he said. 
  "I am sure that producers, traders and consumers the world 
over, including those in China, are keen to see full 
implementation of these and other announced reforms. 
  "I clearly view most positively the prospect of early 
completion of the negotiations on the terms and conditions for 
China's rejoining GATT," he added. 
  Sutherland noted that China's ambitious program of trade and 
economic reforms has contributed greatly to bringing China more 
closely into line with the world trading system. 
  Mahathir said in his speech that an anarchic situation was 
neither going to facilitate the growth and flowering of a free 
market, nor help the transition from a command economy to a 
market economy. 
  "China is right in not making a total and immediate switch," 
he said. "It is right in not simultaneously attempting a 
radical political about-turn." 
  He also spoke highly of China's socialist market economy by 
saying that "China did right in sticking to its brand of 
socialist politics while espousing a version of the market 
economy," because "it is apparently more successful in terms of 
the economy, which is growing very fast." 
  Li Tieying, Chinese state councillor and minister in charge 
of SCRES, Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic 
and Trade Commission, and Gui Shiyong, vice-minister of the 
State Planning Commission, also made speeches to introduce 
China's reform and opening drive. 
  Entrepreneurs from Malaysia, Hong Kong and France also spoke 
at the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA) -- Speaking at an 
international symposium on China's strategy for developing 
foreign economic relations and trade during the 1990's, Wu Yi, 
minister of foreign economic relations and trade, said today 
that, while China restructures its financial, tax, and foreign 
trade systems, the nation's preferential policies for foreign 
investors remain unchanged. 
  Wu Yi told the Chinese and foreign participants at the 
symposium that China, while restructuring its economic and trade 
systems, will continue to attend to respecting and protecting 
foreign businesses' legitimate rights and interests. She said: 
During the new round of foreign trade reforms, state-owned 
foreign trade businesses are allowed to convert renminbi for 
foreign exchange or to buy foreign exchange with renminbi, but 
will adopt interim measures on all foreign-funded businesses in 
China, namely permitting them to maintain their current spot 
exchange accounts to facilitate their production and operations, 
including their import and export businesses. 
  Wu Yi also noted: On the whole, foreign-funded businesses in 
China do not have to pay higher taxes during the new round of 
financial and tax reforms. For the few businesses which do have 
to pay higher taxes, China has drawn up some compensatory 
measures to make sure that they will continue to enjoy 
preferential treatment prescribed in Chinese laws and 
cooperation accords. 
  Wu Yi indicated that China's preferential policies for 
foreign investors remain unchanged. She added that China will 
continue to improve the investment environment and create the 
necessary conditions so that foreign businessmen can enjoy the 
"same treatment as Chinese nationals."

  [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA) -- China hopes that the 
coming century will see neither world war nor cold war, that 
relations among nations will be more open and democratic and 
that the international community will advance in harmony, said 
Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and foreign 
minister here today. 
  The remark was made by Qian Qichen while addressing the 
opening of the symposium on the post-Cold War security situation 
in the Asia-Pacific region and its prospects here today. 
  Dozens of scholars and strategic studies experts from the 
United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the 
Republic of Korea, Russia, India, Singapore, the Philippines, 
Indonesia, Vietnam, and China were invited to participate in the 
symposium. 
  Qian Qichen said: The overall international situation has 
moved toward relaxation since the Cold War, which had continued 
for almost half a century, came to an end. However, there are 
still severe turmoil and unceasing military conflicts in some 
regions. In contrast, the political situation in the 
Asia-Pacific area is rather stable, as the progress there 
towards multipolarity started rather early and the Cold War 
impact was drastically reduced. Moreover, most countries in the 
region have long since given priority to domestic economic 
development, which has helped bring about a virtuous circle of 
mutual promotion between political stability and economic 
development. 
  Qian Qichen pointed out: The situation of relative political 
stability in the region is the result of the close cooperation 
and concerted efforts of the relevant countries, who should all 
treasure and continue to consolidate and develop the situation 
marked by peace, stability, and prosperity. 
  He said: However, there are indeed some factors of 
instability in the Asia-Pacific region. Some of them are 
left-overs from the Cold War; others are issues that have come 
to the fore over the end of the Cold War; still others have been 
caused by failure to adapt to the changes in the post-Cold War 
situation in the areas of policies and ideology [zai zheng ce si 
xiang shang 0961 2398 4595 1835 1927 0006]. Qian Qichen pointed 
out: For peace, security, stability, and development in the 
Asia-Pacific region, it is necessary to attach importance to 
these issues and find a solution for them. 
  He said: The Chinese Government holds that all countries in 
the region should base their relations with other countries 
entirely on the purposes and principles of the United Nations 
charter, the five principles of peaceful coexistence, and other 
universally recognized norms governing international relations. 
Mutual respect and cooperation on an equal footing between 
states should replace hegemonism and power politics. Peaceful 
negotiation, dialogue and consultation should replace the threat 
or use of force. Equality, mutual benefit and complementary 
activities should replace protectionism and economic sanctions 
in trade. Only in this way can the existing and potential 
unstable factors be brought under effective control and be 
removed altogether, so as to help maintain and develop the 
present situation of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  Qian Qichen stressed: China is in favor of a variety of 
channels and levels of bilateral or multilateral dialogue on 
Asia-Pacific security. He said: In addressing the security 
issues of the region, it is necessary to proceed from the 
realities and particular needs of the Asia-Pacific region and 
its sub-regions, and to improve communications and enhance 
mutual confidence among various parties. Moreover, to bring 
about successful cooperation of the nations of the Asia-Pacific 
region on the issue of security, it is necessary to seek common 
ground while reserving differences, to seek truth from facts, 
and to refrain from imposing one's will on any country or on 
others when trying to solve an issue. During the symposium, 
which was organized by the China International Issues Research 
Center, the China Society of International Strategies, and the 
Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, the participating 
scholars and experts are expected to focus on exchanging views 
on the security situation in the region; on the relations among 
China, Japan, the United States, and Russia and their security 
policies in the region; and on the ways and methods adopted by 
countries in the Asia-Pacific region to strengthen political and 
security cooperation among them.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- To become one of the 
world's 10 largest traders, China is to strive for a new foreign 
trade system with improved legislative protection, more 
transparency and open and fair competition. 
  The statement was made by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing at 
the international symposium on China's strategy for foreign 
economy and trade opened here today. 
  Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Director 
General of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
Peter Sutherland made speeches at the symposium. 
  This is the first symposium of its kind to be held in China. 
  In his speeches, Li said that China's foreign trade strategy 
is of vital importance to China's modernization drive as well as 
to the Asian and world economies, for China has a large 
population, a vast market and rich resources. 
  He said that China has made active contributions to the 
world 
economy and trade with the speeding up of China's economic 
development and expansion of its opening since the '80s, which 
has drawn attention from all over the world. 
  He continued that in the latter half of the '90s, China's 
economy will maintain sustained, fast and healthy development 
and China's market will be more open, so China will continue to 
make its due contributions to the world economy. 
  Wu Yi, minister of China's foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, said in her report at the symposium that although 
China's foreign trade has achieved substantial development, it 
can not fully meet the requirements of China's modernization 
construction, adding that China's foreign trade has a vast 
potential. 
  Wu gave a detailed description of China's foreign trade in 
her report titled "Opportunities and Prospects: Basic Framework 
for China's Foreign Trade in the 1990s". 
  She pointed out that China's economy is to be brought 
further 
in line with international practices and China will learn from 
successful international experience to formulate a suitable 
foreign trade strategy so as to ensure its development. 
  Before the opening of the symposium, Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing met with some foreign attendants.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- China today expressed 
its firm determination to take part in the world multi-lateral 
trade system. 
  At the international symposium on China's strategy for 
foreign economy and trade in the 1990s opened [as received] here 
today, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said that China is 
expecting to resume its status as a signatory country of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) at an early date 
and become a founding member of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO). 
  In his speech, Li noted that China, along with other 
countries in the world, will continue to make efforts to 
strengthen a multi-lateral trade system in the world and 
maintain an open world trade environment. 
  Li expressed his hope that on the basis of the multi-lateral 
trade system, China will further its economic and trade 
relations with other countries so as to make its due 
contributions to the world economy. 
  In her report, Wu Yi, minister of Chinese foreign trade and 
economic cooperation, said that China resolutely advocates the 
multi-lateral trade system represented by GATT and is speeding 
up negotiations on its re-entry into GATT, adding that China's 
determination to re-enter GATT is firm and China has made great 
efforts to this end. 
  In accordance with international trade norms and practices, 
she said that China has conducted a series of reforms of its 
foreign trade system such as the improvement of conditions on 
market access and foreign trade transparency. 
  Wu noted that China's more open market plays an active role 
in the world economy and trade, and through reforms this year, 
China's economy and trade will be further brought in line with 
international rules. 
  Wu expressed her thanks to most contracting parties who 
support China for its re-entry into GATT. 
  Meanwhile, she hoped that some contracting parties can 
realize their commitments and take action to support China in 
the bid.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511): "Wu Yi Views China's Foreign 
Trade Strategy in the 1990's"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA)--Today, Wu Yi, minister of 
foreign trade and economic cooperation [MOFTEC], said that in 
the 1990's our country must pursue a "large economic and trade 
strategy" for foreign trade and economic cooperation to 
substantially raise the work in this field to a higher level. 
  At the international symposium on China's foreign trade and 
economic strategy that opened today, Wu Yi analyzed a number of 
important factors in China's foreign trade and economic 
cooperation in the 1990's: First, the tendency to form regional 
economic groups is developing rapidly on the international 
stage, and this will inevitably create a tendency to replace a 
certain amount of trade outside a region with trade within the 
region. This is the so- called "trade shift effect." At the 
same time, trade protectionism will prevail in many fields of 
international trade. Some countries will even try to politicize 
economic relations, pursue unilateralism, and more frequently 
exert unilateral pressure on their trade partners. This will 
directly threaten the operation of the multilateral trade system 
and will also be greatly unfavorable to the development of 
China's foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation. Second, 
China, being a developing country, is still facing a low level 
of production and technology at home and uneven levels of 
economic development have persisted between various localities 
and economic sectors, so the country will continue to have a 
rather low rank in the international economic and trade system. 
Third, in the process of transforming the domestic economic and 
trade structure, frictions between the new system and the old 
will be unavoidable, so it is necessary to properly coordinate 
reform and development. 
  Wu Yi asserted: In the 1990's, China's foreign trade and 
economic cooperation must be based on importing and exporting 
goods, with cooperation and exchanges in the fields of 
commodities, funds, technologies, and services being developed 
in a well-coordinated and interconnected way. The foreign 
trade, production, scientific research, and banking institutions 
should all participate in pursuing the "large economic and trade 
strategy," thus substantially enhancing foreign trade and 
foreign economic cooperation, moving it to a higher level, and 
giving better play to its strategic role in promoting economic 
growth, making structural readjustments, making technological 
progress, and enhancing economic efficiency. 
  She said: It is necessary to create a multi-directional and 
multi-channeled opening pattern in all fields of domestic and 
foreign economic activities by furthering the depth and breadth 
of foreign trade and foreign economic cooperation. It is 
necessary to hasten the process of integrating the activities of 
foreign trade, using foreign capital, making foreign investment, 
and other foreign economic and technical cooperation and to 
ensure the coordinated development of the commodity, technology, 
and service trades. It is also necessary to strive to properly 
integrate multilateral economic cooperation and trade, regional 
economic cooperation and trade, and bilateral economic 
cooperation and trade, thus building up our country's overall 
strength in international competition. 
  She said that, in the 1990's, foreign trade and economic 
cooperation should take the course of intensive development [ji 
yue hua fa zhan 7162 4766 0553 4099 1455] and should strive to 
transform the main body of exports from light industrial and 
textile goods into mechanical and electrical appliances, heavy 
chemical products, high and new technology products and from 
rough processed products with low added value to intensive 
processed products with high added value. It is necessary to 
build up a reasonable foreign market structure which is composed 
primarily of the Asia-Pacific market and supported by the market 
of the neighboring countries and areas, with other markets 
evenly spread in developed and developing countries, thus 
guaranteeing the balanced and well-coordinated development of 
China's foreign trade and foreign economic relations. 
  Wu Yi also revealed that China's first "Foreign Trade Law" 
had been submitted to the seventh meeting of the Eighth National 
People's Congress Standing Committee for deliberation, and the 
other laws and regulations related to the "Foreign Trade Law" 
were also being drafted. In about three years, China will 
basically set up a rather perfect legal system for foreign trade 
and foreign economic activities.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- China is to set up a new 
foreign trade framework by the end of this century, according to 
Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation 
(MOFTEC), here today. 
  She said at an international symposium here this morning 
that 
the new framework will be a combination of commodity, fund, 
technology and labor services based on imports and exports in 
order to realize a coordinated range of development. 
  She said that the strategy will need the participation of 
all 
sectors in charge of foreign economic relations and trade, 
production, science and technology as well as finance. 
  To this end, the minister proposed the following measures: 
  -- To further its reform of the foreign trade system and try 
to formulate a pattern of opening in all directions, across 
several fields and through multi-channels; 
  -- To speed up the integration of various businesses of 
foreign trade and economic cooperation including foreign trade, 
use of foreign funds, investing abroad and technical cooperation; 
  -- To take an intensive development road and to continue the 
strategy of winning through improving quality of products; 
  -- To explore plural markets and form a rational structure 
of 
export markets with its focus on the markets in Asian and 
Pacific area with support from neighboring markets and with a 
proportionate distribution in developed countries. 
  Wu said that China advocates a balance between imports and 
exports and will open its domestic market to all trade partners 
on the basis of the increase of its exports. 
  She also touched on the use of overseas funds, introduction 
of technologies and foreign trade working skills. 
  She noted that China will gradually open and improve its 
service trade to meet the development of world trade. 
  Meanwhile, China is to explore the service trade market 
worldwide and develop its advantageously placed service sector 
so as to achieve a balance in its service trade.

  [Text] Vienna, May 11 (XINHUA) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) announced today that it will send a mission 
to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Saturday 
[14 May] to continue its inspection of the DPRK's nuclear 
facilities. 
  Tests will be conducted at a reprocessing plant if the DPRK 
government gives a positive reply or does not raise any 
objection to the move before the weekend, IAEA Spokesman David 
Kyd said. 
  IAEA Director General Hans Blix said in a message sent to 
DPRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam on Tuesday that it was 
crucial for international experts to inspect spent uranium fuel 
rods at the nuclear reactor when the plant is refueled. 
  Blix also requested the DPRK to send a team of experts to 
Vienna to discuss measures and a timetable for inspections of 
the reactor. 
  Last week, an IAEA spokesman said last week that the agency 
will not send inspectors to the DPRK until the government gives 
the green light to an overall inspection of its nuclear 
facilities.

  [Text] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Economics, science and 
technology, and laws are three important factors behind today's 
social development. More than 200 Chinese and foreign 
specialists, scholars, and entrepreneurs gathered in Beijing 
today to attend a four-day international conference on 
integrating and developing economics, science and technology, 
and laws. 
  The main theme of the conference, which is jointly sponsored 
by the China Association for Science and Technology and the 
Chinese Society of International Economic, Scientific and 
Technological, and Legal Personnel, is to study and explore the 
operational mechanisms for integrating and developing the 
economic, scientific and technological, and legal fields; to 
search for ways to groom and train interdisciplinary personnel 
suited to these efforts; to further promote economic prosperity, 
scientific and technological advancement, and the sound 
development of laws; to increase exchanges and cooperation 
between specialists and scholars in various countries; and to 
advance social development and progress. 
  Chen Muhua and Li Ximing, vice chairpersons of the National 
People's Congress Standing Committee, attended the opening 
ceremony this morning. 
  This was the first time that an international conference of 
interdisciplinary personnel from a wide range of fields was held 
in our country. Chinese and foreign specialists and scholars 
submitted 65 academic papers to the conference. The papers show 
that they share this common understanding: The integration and 
development of economics, science and technology, and laws is a 
very important research project. Science and technology are the 
motive forces for social progress, the economy is the foundation 
of social development, and laws are guarantees for social 
progress. The integration and simultaneous development of these 
three aspects represent a general trend in today's social 
development. 
  In his speech, Justice Minister Xiao Yang said: The 
convocation of this international conference will facilitate the 
efforts to explore the operational mechanisms for integrating 
economics, science and technology, and laws; to search for ways 
to groom and train interdisciplinary personnel; and to promote 
academic services, peace, and development in the world. 
Moreover, it will benefit contacts and exchanges between people 
in economic, scientific and technological, legal, and business 
circles in various countries, thereby creating conditions for 
forging effective links and cooperation in the future. 
  In his speech, Zou Yu, president of the Chinese Society of 
International Economic, Scientific and Technological, and Legal 
Personnel, said: The present-day world is characterized by very 
close economic contacts between various countries and regions, 
and by an extremely rapid pace of interaction between the 
economy on the one hand and science and technology on the other. 
The development of these two fields should be guaranteed by 
law, and it is increasingly urgent to coordinate and harmonize 
various laws. This dictates long-term exchanges and cooperation 
between specialists and scholars in various countries in 
carrying out strenuous, in-depth exploration and studies in a 
joint effort to promote social progress and development. 
  Attending the conference are more than 60 economic, 
scientific and technological, and legal specialists and scholars 
from such countries and regions as Germany, Canada, the United 
States, Australia, and Austria.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The Walmart Company, a 
leading retailer of the United States, is studying the 
possibility of entering the Chinese retail market, according to 
the chairman of the board of directors of the company. 
  Robson Walton, whose company's retail sales volume tops 55 
billion U.S. dollars annually, has arrived in Tianjin to 
investigate market potential. 
  He said he is very much interested in China's huge market 
potential and is looking for investment possibilities in the 
north China port city. 
  The chairman has inspected several large commercial centers 
in the city and conducted in-depth discussions with local 
officials. 
  Tianjin, one of the leading trade and commercial centers in 
northern China and one of the few cities that allow foreign 
investment in commerce and retail sales, has become the favorite 
of many foreign investors. 
  The Isetan Company of Japan, which leased and opened a large 
shopping center in the city last year, is achieving a rising 
business volume. Another large store funded by a Hong Kong 
company is also being constructed. 
  Other overseas businessmen eyeing Tianjin market potentials 
include the Chia Tai Group company of Thailand and the Nino 
Textile Company of Germany, local officials revealed.

  [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- The China National 
Technical Import and Export Corporation (CNTIC) signed a 
contract here today with the U.S. Foster wheeler energy company 
to import a boiler island worth 190 million U.S. dollars. 
  The island is being imported for the Ezhou Power Station, 30 
km east of Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province. 
  The power station, composed of two sets of turbogenerators 
with a capacity of 300,000 kilowatts each, is the first thermal 
power plant built with part of the third batch of loans from the 
Japanese Government. 
  The station is made up of a boiler island, turbine island 
and 
a electrical equipment island. 
  Last March, CNTIC signed contracts with Japan's Itochu 
Corporation and ABB Ltd. to import a turbine island and an 
electrical equipment island worth 130 million U.S. dollars. 
  Last year, the Foster Wheeler Energy Company exported a 
boiler island to Zouxian Power Station in east China's Shandong 
Province. 
  The construction of the Ezhou Power Station will help ease 
electricity shortages in Hubei Province, CNTIC sources said.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Yang Yuanhua (2799 0337 5478): "Why </F>
the United States Readjusts its Peace-Keeping Policy"] 
  [Text] Last week, U.S. President Clinton signed a new 
decree on U.S. peacekeeping policy, setting out strict 
conditions for selective U.S. participation in UN peacekeeping 
operations. It no longer advocates, as it did in the past, that 
the United Nations send peacekeeping forces to act as a global 
policeman in any region experiencing conflict. 
  This move by the United States is the result of protracted 
research and extensive negotiations with Congress. Madeleine 
Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said: This 
decree "is not intended to expand UN peacekeeping operations, 
but to help it get oriented." This policy readjustment conveys 
a message, which is that the United States cannot resolve all 
conflicts in the world and does not believe the United Nations 
is capable of creating and maintaining peace, especially in 
regions where wars have been continuing and enmity still exists. 
  The second message is that the readjustment of the U.S. 
peacekeeping policy is based on the consideration of U.S. 
interests. Albright gave footnotes to the decree, saying: The 
objective of this decree is that "we are not going to ask the 
United Nations to take up missions that are beyond its 
capability, but to help it complete the missions we hope it can 
complete and succeed in." The conditions provided for by this 
policy are that it is necessary to consider promoting U.S. 
interests, consider the ability to supply personnel and capital, 
win support from the U.S. Congress, have clear objectives, and 
not get bogged down for a long time in peacekeeping operations 
that have no hope of success. 
  The third message is that the United States is striving to 
reduce its budget for peacekeeping operations. At present, the 
United States shoulders 31.7 percent of the peacekeeping 
operations budget. The decree provides for reducing this 
expenditure, as the United States hopes, to 25 percent. The 
U.S. Congress obviously is indifferent to and hesitant about 
increasing appropriations for this. In a report in May, the 
U.S. Government pointed out that the United Nations is launching 
or plans to launch 36 peacekeeping operations, whereas the 
American people have long complained about missions that entail 
huge amounts of funds and that do not involve the safeguarding 
of national interests, yet require the sending of young 
Americans. 
  The fourth message is that the United States does not 
support 
the United Nations in building up a permanent force, nor is it 
sending troops to prepare for or support this force, and that 
moreover, U.S. combat forces will not be placed under the direct 
command of foreign servicemen. This obviously differs greatly 
from the idea -- as put forward by Clinton in 1992 -- of 
building up an international force and stationing it on the 
borders of countries threatened by aggression. 
  Observers maintain that the readjustment of U.S. 
peacekeeping 
policy shows the decline of the U.S. status, that it takes the 
strategy of retreating before advancing under the pressure of 
Congress and public opinion, and that it is reducing the burdens 
of capital and manpower so that the selective U.S. participation 
in UN peacekeeping operations can be more effective. Moreover, 
they maintain, the United States is doing its best to act as 
leader in world affairs, influencing or swaying the missions of 
the United Nations. It is foreseeable that this U.S. move 
inevitably will have a huge influence in the scramble for 
spheres of influence among the major Western powers.

  [Text] Moscow, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev said on Friday [6 May] that he will outline 
Russia's new approaches to the "partnership for peace" program 
in Brussels on May 24. 
  At a news conference at the Russian Defense Ministry, 
Grachev 
stressed that Russia should put forth its own idea of 
partnership. 
  A special team of Russian experts is to draw up proposals on 
this score before May 15, the minister said, adding that the 
proposals will be discussed by the Russian Security Council. 
  If approved, the new idea will be read out by Grachev before 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) defense ministers 
at the NATO headquarters in Brussels. 
  The minister told reporters that he had discussed the new 
Russian proposals concerning the "partnership for peace" program 
with President Boris Yeltsin. 
  He stressed that some provisions of the NATO's program do 
not 
suit Russia. "The role of NATO and the West European Union is 
growing in Europe, but they have no right to...overlook the 
interests of Russia," the minister pointed out. 
  At the news conference, Grachev also noted that the planned 
joint Russian-U.S. peace-making exercises on the Totsk testing 
ground near Orenburg should take place. He disagrees with the 
Russian state Duma's view that they should be cancelled. 
  Touching upon Russia's armed forces, the minister said they 
are confronted with three main problems which must be solved. 
The problems include the financing of the military 
establishment, the army's manning status and the accommodation 
of troops withdrawn from abroad.

  [Text] Moscow, May 6 (XINHUA) -- The promotion of good 
neighborly relations with China is in keeping with Russia's 
long-term national interest, Vladimir Podoprigora, chairman of 
the committee on foreign affairs of the federation council said 
here today. 
  At a press conference following a parliamentary hearing on 
the development of Sino-Russian relations, Podoprigora said that 
promoting relations will be beneficial to the security and 
stability of the Asia-Pacific region and the world. 
  Mutually beneficial economic and trade relations with China 
is an important element in Russia's economic reform and for the 
integration of the Asian-Pacific region, he added. 
  Addressing the problems of the development, Podoprigora said 
the process now lacks coordinated long-term strategy, and that 
the import-export system must be perfected.

<F P=106> ["It Seems to Me" column by Zhang Huimin: "Spectre of </F>
Aggression Still Haunts Japan"] 
  [Text] The moment I heard the statements, I knew I had to 
write something. But things happened too fast. Before I could 
turn my rage into action the event had already receded into the 
past. 
  Mr Shigeto Nagano's remarks on Japan's role and behaviour in 
World War II were published in the news media last Wednesday. 
He retracted his "inappropriate" comments on Friday. And then 
he resigned as Japan's justice minister on Saturday. 
  Nagano is down and out and his case seems to have already 
been forgotten. 
  But from a historical perspective, these comments must not 
be 
forgotten so soon. I know Nagano is not the first Japanese 
politician in recent years to make such "inappropriate" 
utterances regarding Japan's past, but I wonder if he will be 
the last. 
  In 1894, Japan defeated China's Qing Dynasty and wrested 
Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from China. This marked the first 
successful step of Japanese aggression against China in modern 
times. 
  With the 20th century ushered in, Japan's aim to devour all 
of China intensified and the methods diversified. 
  It imposed on a Chinese warlord then in power the Twenty-one 
Demands, which reduced China to a de facto colony of Japan. 
Then, with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, it replaced 
Germany's interests in Shandong Province after World War I. It 
engineered the Jinan Incident slaughtering Chinese people in 
Shandong to deter Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expeditionary Army 
from pushing further north. And a bomb blast killed a warlord 
who ruled northeast China when he got in their way. 
  In 1931, Japan conquered China's three northeast provinces 
and set up the Machurian puppet regime; soon afterward, it 
seized the then Jehol Province in north China. 
  In 1937, it launched a full-scale invasion of China. In 
1941, it started the war in the Pacific with the bombing of 
Pearl Harbour. 
  Finally, in 1945, after a half-century effort to repel 
Japanese aggression, came Japan's unconditional surrender to the 
Allied Nations. The fond dreams of the Japanese militarists for 
world domination came to naught. 
  Their aggression brought untold misery to the victim 
countries, killing millions upon millions of people. It also 
grievously hurt the Japanese people themselves. Japan is the 
only country in the world to have been hit by atomic bombs. 
  Mr Nagano, now 71, is well educated enough that he was 
qualified to serve as Japan's justice minister. 
  He cannot be ignorant of his nation's past. 
  This being the case, any Japanese person with reason and 
sense should be able to form an objective view of Japan's role 
in Asia and the whole world in the first half of this century. 
  In 1972, when Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei came to 
China to re-establish diplomatic ties, he said that Japan had 
caused China trouble in the past, and for that, he was sorry. 
Mild as the wording was, it was meant as an apology 
nevertheless. 
  I remember resenting his understatement though I recognized 
that he was the first Japanese leader to apologize to China. 
  Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is the Japanese 
official who made the most candid and unbiased appraisal when he 
admitted that the events in the 1930's and 1940's were "a war of 
aggression and a wrong war." The apologies he made during 
official tours of South Korea and China were the most sincere 
and thorough any Japanese prime minister has ever made. 
  However, there is another crop of Japanese who still deny 
their past even though it is almost 50 years since Japan's 
aggression was completely defeated. 
  In the mid-1980's, a Japanese education minister had the 
audacity to defend Japan's infamous record in World War II. He 
won no open applause. Instead he evoked condemnation from the 
former victim nations as well as his own countrymen. 
Consequently, he too resigned dismally. 
  A few years later another cabinet member followed suit and 
met with the same wretched fate. And when a Japanese minister 
tried to whitewash the past by saying that the academic 
definition of the aggression should be left to the future 
historians, he was immediately trounced by angry critics. 
  The fact is that whenever a Japanese politician makes some 
"inappropriate" remark on Japan's past, he is bound to meet with 
indignant refutation at home and abroad. 
  Nagano claimed that the Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication. 
Let me remind him about a fact which he, as an old man of 71, 
must still remember. 
  Two young junior officers of the Japanese Army, on entering 
Nanjing in the winter of 1937, competed with each other on who 
would kill more Chinese civilians in one day. The result was 
that each killed more than 100. A photo of the two standing 
side by side with swords in their hands was published in the 
most influential newspaper in Japan with the caption praising 
the two as "heroes." 
  However, as the saying goes, the mills of God grind slowly, 
and 10 years later, these two Japanese butchers received justice 
in full measure in Nanjing. Ironically, the news report and the 
photo, once in honour of them, became damning evidence against 
them. 
  Mr Nagano, can you dismiss this as fabrication? 
  Nagano, as a shrewd politician, must have known what 
response 
his wild remarks would evoke. Nevertheless, he did not hesitate 
to make them. This makes me suspect that this former member of 
the Imperial Japanese Army is, from the bottom of his heart, 
still nostalgic for the glories of Japanese militarism. He 
simply could not contain the strong urge to vent his inner 
feelings, whatever consequence his mouthing off would bring. 
  Strong pressure forced Nagano to retract his erratic 
utterances and offer apologies in three day's time. This shows 
how unpopular his behaviour was even in his own country. 
  But his retraction is only lip service meant for appeasement 
so that he can get away. How can you expect to fundamentally 
change in only three days' time the deep-seated ideas of a 
politician? 
  The string of incidences simply indicates that the spectre 
of 
militarism still haunts some Japanese minds, especially the 
older ones. 
  Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of the Japanese have 
conscientiously awakened to the inglorious past of their country. 
  When Nagano's behaviour aroused an uproar, Japan's new prime 
minister, Tsutomu Hata, lost no time to make known his stand. 
"Japan's past actions, including aggression and colonial rule, 
caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many people," he 
said. He even pledged to communicate this solemn admission to 
future generations to affirm "Japan's commitment to the path of 
peace." 
  Only with this approach can Japan hope to win the respect of 
the world community and cultivate true friendship with other 
countries, including China.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 KYODO -- A Chinese magazine will 
later this month publish "top secret" Japanese documents aiming 
to verify the true nature of the 1937 massacre of Chinese 
civilians in Nanjing, state press reported Tuesday [10 May]. 
  "MINGUO DANGAN (Files of the Republic) will publish for the 
first time historic files written by the Japanese invaders 
themselves which will uncover the true facts of the Nanjing 
massacre," Xinhua News Agency reported. 
  The documents, marked "top secret," were produced by a 
special group of the South Manchuria Railway, a railway company 
set up in northeast China by the invading Japanese, the report 
said. 
  In mid-January 1938 the group reported that a 600-member 
team 
was formed and had buried around 5,000 corpses by the beginning 
of February. 
  By March 15, after three months, the group reported that 
1,793 corpses had been buried inside Nanjing and 29,998 were 
buried outside the city. 
  According to the XINHUA report, charitable and benevolent 
groups, such as the Red Cross, were involved in burying the dead. 
  "So if the Red Cross could bury some 30,000 corpses in three 
months, then it can be seen that the number of Nanjing citizens 
slaughtered by the invading Japanese Army was large," it said. 
  The documents have been kept with files in the northeastern 
province of Liaoning, it said. 
  The Chinese Government and citizens have long questioned the 
Japanese interpretation of its 1931-45 invasion of China and was 
especially outraged when former Japanese Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano last week called the Nanjing Massacre "a 
fabrication." 
  Nagano, who also denied Japan was the aggressor in the war, 
has since resigned, but in China his statements have open up old 
wounds that have never completely healed. 
  China estimates that Imperial Japanese Army troops massacred 
more than 300,000 Chinese civilians following their invasion of 
the then Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937. 
  According to estimates given at the Tokyo war crimes 
tribunal 
in 1948, about 42,000 civilians were killed in Nanjing and more 
than 100,000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed in the 
vicinity over the next six weeks.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 11 (XINHUA) - King Norodom Sihanouk 
of Cambodia announced suddenly today that he will leave for 
China on May 18 to resume chemotherapy treatment for cancer. 
  A statement released by the royal palace said the reason the 
king is going to China earlier than planned is because he has 
been "slandered" over his latest proposals for peace. 
  Some local newspapers have recently accused the king of 
seeking to regain power by proposing new elections. 
  "From now on, I quit concerning myself with this tragic 
problem between the royal government and the Democratic 
Kampuchea Party. I don't want people to continue to slander 
me," the king, who repeatedly sought a peaceful solution to the 
civil war, said in a written statement. 
  In order to end the civil war and realize peace and national 
reconciliation in the country, Sihanouk proposed holding an 
early election to give the Democratic Kampuchea Party a chance 
to join the government. 
  On May 9, Khieu Samphan wrote to Sihanouk saying that he 
supported the proposal, but the government did not give a 
positive response. Some officials expressed the view that the 
term of the present government has yet expired, and that there 
are no fund available for another national election.

<F P=106> [By Abdul Rahman Sulaiman] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Countries of 
Southeast Asia should have no fear of a wealthy and strong China 
and they should instead welcome it, Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed said Wednesday. 
  The prime minister said the countries would tend to benefit 
in the long term of their ability to share the wealth through 
trade and economic interaction with China. 
  He told an international business gathering of the world's 
top corporate leaders here that the Chinese had now found an 
answer to their political and economic needs in what they termed 
the socialist market economy. 
  Dr. Mahathir, who flew here after a successful meeting with 
U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington, dwelt at length on 
Malaysia's early experience in managing its economy and the 
obstacles it faced, democracy, and China's current economic 
modernization efforts in his address on the theme "The Socialist 
Market Economy of the People's Republic of China: An ASEAN 
Perspective" at the 1994 China summit meeting. 
  He said although he was no expert on China, he had followed 
with a great deal of interest over the last 68 years of his life 
as an individual the great events occurring in and around China. 
He said: I have read substantially about China's last 2,000 
years. But I'm by no stretch of the imagination an expert on 
China. 
  I cannot imagine that I know more about Chinese policy than 
the Chinese leadership and its wealth of advisors. 
  Nevertheless, he intuitively understood what China was 
attempting to do, why it was doing it, and how it was going 
about the entire process of revolutionising its society and 
building towards a place of pride and comprehensive prosperity 
for its people in the 21st century. He believed his views were 
shared by other leaders in ASEAN and East Asia. 
  This was because almost all countries in East Asia were 
trying to do the same thing in the best way they knew how given 
the complexities of their own specific situations, the enormous 
obstacles, and the incredible opportunities before them. 
  Dr. Mahathir said China was right in sticking to its brand 
of 
socialist politics while espousing a version of the market 
economy. 
  This was so because it had managed to avoid the kind of 
economic and political anarchy the Soviet Union suffered. It is 
right because it is apparently more successful economically. It 
is growing and growing very fast, he added. 
  He cautioned the Western powers against being too fearful of 
a prosperous China. He said although a rich China would spend 
much more than what it is now spending on its military forces 
and, thus, [words indistinct], historically, Beijing had not 
exhibited any consistent policy of territorial acquisitiveness. 
  He added: Its neighbours may have lost some disputed 
territory, but full invasion and colonisation has not been a 
feature of Chinese history. This differs very much, of course, 
from the European record. He said the question of Chinese 
aggression occupied much of the Western mind because, 
historically, hegemony and violent or peaceful occupation of 
territories had always been the West's approach to 
self-preservation and wealth. As a result, they naturally 
suspected China of having similar ambitions.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (AFP)--Malaysian Prime Minister 
Mahathir bin Mohamad on Wednesday offered strong support for the 
Chinese government's resistance to western pressure to change 
its social and political policies. 
  "China needs the strong government that it has. It may be 
authoritarian, but it is better than anarchy," said Mahathir. 
"Business needs order," he declared. 
  "For the moment the interest of the majority demands an 
orderly society," he said in a speech at a two-day international 
conference here on the "socialist market economy." 
  Mahathir advocated controlled development of a market 
economy. He said "it is right in not attempting a radical 
political about- turn simultaneously" with economic reforms. 
  The Malaysian premier strongly criticised western countries 
and accused them of wanting to weaken China. "This 
proselytising for democracy veils only slightly the objective of 
eliminating competition before it begins," he said. "They would 
like the East Asian democracies to be weak and unstable like 
theirs," he said, denouncing proposals by some nations for a 
worldwide minimum wage clause in the final text of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Mahathir said he supported a strong China, which he 
described 
as an "engine of growth firstly for East Asia, including 
Southeast Asia, and the world." "Southeast Asia should have no 
fear of a wealthy and strong China."

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 10 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese ocean survey 
ship, the "Haiyang No. 4", left here for mid-Pacific waters 
yesterday to search for seabed minerals. 
  Official sources said the vessel would engage in a survey of 
metal nodules in an area of 150,000 sq [square] km that has been 
allocated to China by the United Nations for investigation. 
  The sources said that this is the sixth time since 1986 for 
the vessel, owned by the Chinese Ministry of Geology and Mineral 
Resources, to carry out such a mission. 
  By employing submarine photography and detection means, 
scientists on the vessel will try to work out a metal nodule 
distribution map in an area of 33,000 sq km, the sources said. 
  They added that scientists on the vessel were also equipped 
with the most advanced international "sea beam" system, which 
would be used in drawing maps of the submarine terrain. 
  The "Haiyang No. 4" will also continue the unfinished survey 
which was being carried out by the "Xiangyanghong No. 16", 
another Chinese survey vessel, before it was involved in an 
accident, the sources said. 
  Two technicians -- one from Algeria and one from the Sudan 
-- 
dispatched by the United Nations, will be trained on the ship in 
ocean survey operations, the sources said. 
  The ship also carries three experts from "International 
Ocean 
Metals", and their equipment for joint studies. 
  On board the "Haiyang No. 4" are 86 persons, 46 of them 
being 
researchers. 
  The vessel will cover about 30,000 nautical miles in the 
survey, which is scheduled to last until December 26 this year.

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, May 11 (XINHUA) -- The first 
group of Palestinian policemen numbering some 150 arrived in the 
Gaza Strip at about 03:00 (12:00 GMT) this morning, formally 
starting Palestinian self-rule in the strip. 
  The entry of the Palestinian police into Gaza was in 
accordance with an agreement signed between the Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel on implementing 
Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank's 
Jericho area. 
  The first group of Palestinian police had been scheduled to 
come on May 8. But the arrival was delayed because of some 
technical problems and lack of adequate coordination between the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides. 
  Before the arrival of the group, Major General Naser Yousef, 
commander of the Palestinian National Security Forces, and 
Brigadier Yom-Tov Samia, head of the Israeli side of the 
coordination committee between the Palestinians and Israelis on 
the transfer of authorities in Gaza, met Tuesday [10 May] 
afternoon with local and foreign reporters at the Rafah Border 
Check Point, the scheduled entrance for the Palestinian 
policemen to Gaza from Egypt. 
  Yousef said, "this is a historic day, the first day on the 
road of independence and freedom of the Palestinian people. It 
is also the starting of the implementation of the May 4 Cairo 
Agreement" between the Palestinians and the Israelis. 
  He said he believed "we will be capable of building our 
relations with our brothers and neighbors with very good spirit. 
Good neighborliness will prevail in this area." 
  Samia, who is also former commander of the Israeli forces in 
the Gaza Strip, said he hoped "security people on both sides 
will work together to ensure smooth transfer of area camps and 
responsibility," adding he believed both sides are ready to make 
it as smooth as possible. 
  In this way, he said, both sides can continue their 
missions, 
a common mission, to make sure that the people on both sides in 
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area will feel safety and "we can 
start a new era of prosperity for all the area." 
  Over the past few days, local Palestinian people expressed 
their joy and excitement by turning out to the streets and 
gathering at the main road near the Rafah Border Check Point, 
some 50 kilometers southwest of Gaza City, to greet the arrival 
of the police. 
  Thousands of people waited for three consecutive days, some 
holding flags of the PLO, some singing and dancing, and others 
chanting slogans. 
  A total of some 9,000 Palestinian policemen will be deployed 
in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The PLO and Israel signed a peace accord in Washington on 
last September 13, which provides for Palestinian self-rule in 
the two areas as a step toward a final resolution of the 
Palestinian problem.

  [Text] Vienna, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Austrian Chancellor 
Franz Vranitzky today said he will actively support the further 
development of the relations between Austria and China. 
  Vranitzky made the remarks at a meeting with a municipal 
delegation from the Chinese capital city Beijing led by its 
Mayor Li Qiyan. 
  Vranitzky said his successful visit to Beijing last year 
deeply impressed him, adding that the development of good 
relationship and economic cooperation between the two countries 
have been greatly boosted by the exchange of visits between the 
two countries' leaders. 
  The Austrian chancellor also expressed his support for 
further cooperation between the two countries' capital cities. 
  The Beijing delegation arrived here on May 8 at the 
invitation of Vienna Mayor Helmut Zilk. The two sides today 
signed two documents to increase bilateral exchange of 
information in the health and cultural fields.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (AFP)--French group Aerospatiale, 
main constructor of the Ariane rocket, wants to develop 
satellite cooperation with China, its chairman Louis Gallois 
said here Wednesday. 
  He told a press conference that an Aerospatiale technical 
team will arrive in Beijing within the next few days to study 
areas for space cooperation, particularly for satellites. 
  Although China's Long March rocket launcher is a direct 
competitor to Ariane "we need to work with China and have 
technical exchanges," he added. 
  Gallois said his group's presence in China did not reflect 
the company's position in Asia where it sold 35 percent of its 
exports. 
  China had bought only 43 Airbus aircraft, manufactured by 
the 
European consortium in which the French group is a partner, 
compared with 90 McDonnell Douglas planes and 225 Boeings, its 
U.S. rivals. 
  He said "we must increase our presence in China and the aim 
of this trip is to assure the Chinese authorities that we want 
to invest long-term in this country." 
  Aerospatiale, active in both civilian and military spheres, 
has an annual turnover of around nine billion dollars, 70 
percent from exports. 
  It controls two thirds of Arianespace, has a 38 percent 
stake 
in Airbus and 50 percent in a Franco-Italian regional transport 
plane ATR. The group also manufactures helicopters and tactical 
and ballistic missiles. 
  Gallois said the turbo-prop ATR-42 was particularly suited 
for regional operations and ideal for a country like China. He 
said 150 ATR models had been sold in the United States. A key 
part for the plane is already being manufactured under licence 
in Xian, northern China, he said. 
  In cooperation with a factory in Harbin, northeast China, 
the 
group was also developing a light helicopter -- the EC 120. The 
factory has been manufacturing the Dauphin helicopter under 
licence for several years and has sold more than 100 models in 
China. 
  Gallois said Aerospatiale was also ready to offer training 
to 
Chinese civilian pilots and "possibly" to military pilots.

Consultative Conference (CPPCC), held talks here today with 
Norwegian Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore 
Godal on joint efforts to promote cooperation between China and 
Norway. 
  Li Ruihuan briefed Godal on China's current economic 
construction and the democratic politics. 
  He said democracy marks the advance of a society, it is also 
the inevitable trend of history. The Chinese government 
maintains that the building of democratic politics actively and 
steadily must be on the basis of social stability. Otherwise, 
he said, it will hurt society and even create social chaos. 
  Godal said that Norway gives great importance to relations 
with China which has world influence. 
  He said he is pleased to see the rapid development of 
Sino-Norwegian cooperation in trade, science and other fields.

  [Text] Warsaw, 9 May (XINHUA) -- On the morning of 9 May, 
Polish Prime Minister Waldeman Pawlak met with General Zhang 
Wannian, member of the Central Military Commission and chief of 
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army [PLA], and 
his party who are currently visiting Poland.

bilateral cooperative relations in the military field. He said 
Poland hopes to establish a cooperative partnership with China, 
particularly in the economic field.

period of normal development after experiencing acute changes. 
Located in central Eastern Europe, Poland can serve as a bridge 
for developing China's contacts with Western European countries.

attach great importance to developing friendly relations and 
cooperation with Poland and the Polish Army; and the purpose of 
his current visit is to deepen understanding and enhance 
friendship to promote the development of relations between the 
two countries and two armies.

party arrived in Warsaw on 7 May for this visit.

<F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] The UN Security Council yesterday unanimously 
adopted a resolution on imposing further economic sanctions 
against Haiti. The resolution will come into force at 0000 on 22 
May. The resolution calls on various countries to forbid all 
imports from and exports to Haiti with the exception of food, 
medicine, and items for humanitarian purposes. It also calls 
for banning air and sea transportation to Haiti except scheduled 
transportation for passengers. The resolution emphatically 
points out that the UN Security Council will remove all 
sanctions against Haiti only when Haiti's military rulers step 
down and the executive power of Aristide, the democratically 
elected president of Haiti, is returned and restored. 
  The UN Security Council resolution was proposed by the 
United 
States, France, Argentina, and other countries. 
  China maintains its reservations, although China voted for 
the resolution. Chen Jian, deputy representative of China's 
permanent mission to the United Nations, emphatically pointed 
out in his speech that China's persistent stand is not in favor 
of using sanctions as a method to resolve conflicts. The 
sanctions measure included in the resolution is a special 
measure to be taken under the extremely special situation in 
Haiti at present.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F>
Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 
1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- The fourth seminar for 
principal provincial and ministerial leading cadres to study 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
opened at the Central Party School today. Hu Jintao, Standing 
Committee member of the Political Bureau and member of the 
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and principal of the 
Central Party School, spoke at the opening ceremony today. He 
emphasized: In studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we should 
combine theoretical study with practice, and concentrate efforts 
on two issues -- to master the theoretical system and to use the 
theory to solve existing major practical problems. Only when we 
have grasped the scientific world outlook and methodology can we 
assess the situation in a correct way, achieve unity in 
thinking, have the overall situation under control, tackle major 
problems, enhance our foresightedness in our work and do it in a 
more scientific manner, brush aside difficulties, and 
continually promote the reform and open policy and the socialist 
modernization cause. 
  Ding Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and Secretariat, presided over the opening ceremony. Ren 
Jianxin, Secretariat member of the CPC Central Committee, 
attended the ceremony. 
  In his speech, Hu Jintao said: All localities and 
departments have done a tremendous job in implementing the 
central authorities' general principles and plans for the work 
of the whole party. While the general situation is good, there 
are still certain problems and difficulties in China's social 
and economic lives. Therefore, we should, first, be clearly 
aware of the problems and difficulties on the road of advance, 
noting both their objective existence, as well as the advantages 
for solving problems and difficulties. We should neither treat 
them lightly nor forfeit our confidence in solving them. 
Second, we should seek a scientific way for solving problems. 
We should step up investigation and study and accurately 
identify the crux of problems. We should actively and 
conscientiously probe for solutions through reform and 
development. 
  He said: We should take bold steps in probing for solutions 
to the existing problems under the guidance of scientific 
theories. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, which is profound in meaning and 
wide in coverage, has given an incisive exposition on a series 
of fundamental issues related to the building of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, including the adherence to one central 
task and two basic points; correct handling of the relationship 
between reform, development, and stability; the persistence in 
being tough with both hands; and the CPC's internal improvement 
as the key to solving problems in China. Problems which Comrade 
Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized that we must solve properly, 
things which he has reminded us time and again that we must pay 
attention to, and tendencies which he has periodically 
admonished that we must guard against are still of great guiding 
and practical significance today. In a sense, theoretical level 
decides leadership quality. This is particularly so for the 
party's senior leading cadres. If we want to implement the 
party's basic line comprehensively and accurately, to grasp the 
overall situation of the work of the whole party and country, to 
do all tasks well, and to consolidate and develop the good 
situation, we must study theories with a greater sense of 
urgency and more conscientiously so that we can enhance our 
theoretical level and more effectively carry out our leadership 
responsibility. 
  He said: The present basic task for the whole party in 
further studying Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics is to grasp the theory's scientific 
system and use it to solve existing prominent problems through 
profound study. The theory is a comprehensive system. Without 
studying and mastering the ideological views and principles of 
the theoretical system, it is impossible to truly understand and 
correctly use the theory in practice. To really master the 
theory's scientific system is no easy task and cannot be 
accomplished overnight; it requires protracted and unremitting 
efforts. The sole purpose of study is to use the theory as a 
weapon for guiding and correctly identifying and solving 
practical problems in reform and construction. This year, we 
have launched a great number of comprehensive coordinated reform 
programs focused on the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure. The reform programs, which involve 
readjustment of the pattern and relations of interests in 
various sectors, will tackle many deep-seated problems and will 
be rather difficult. In the process of deepening reform in all 
fields and expediting the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure, it will be a real test for our party 
committees and leading cadres at all levels to maintain a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; to ensure 
social and political stability; to comprehensively implement the 
party Central Committee's policies, decisions, and plans; and to 
properly handle the relations between reform, development, and 
stability. At present, we should take effective measures to 
solve problems unfavorable to further reform, development, and 
stability. 
  Discussing the question of strengthening and improving party 
building, he said: The key to adhering to the party's basic 
line for 100 years lies in the party. The key to creating the 
overall environment for seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability also lies in the party. If we do not strengthen party 
leadership and further promote party building, we can go 
nowhere. We will accomplish nothing if we fail to implement the 
party's basic line in the light of realities and if we deviate 
from the overall interests of reform, development, and stability 
in promoting party building alone. We must keep abreast of the 
demands and tasks of the new situation and must improve the 
party ideologically, politically, organizationally, and in its 
style so as to solve the existing problems in party building and 
increase the party's cohesive and rallying power and fighting 
capacity to provide more effective guarantees for reform, 
development, and stability. 
  Responsible comrades from the departments concerned Zeng 
Qinghong, Zheng Bijian, Zhao Zongnai, Wang Jialiu Zheng Keyang, 
Chen Fujin, and Zhou Ziyu were present at the opening ceremony.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA) -- A get-together was held 
in Beijing to mark 1994 International Family Year. 
  Wang Shoudao, Li Desheng, Chen Xilian, Wang Enmao, and other 
revolutionaries of the older generation, as well as people from 
all walks of life in Beijing, attended the get-together. 
  The 44th UN General Assembly passed a resolution in 1989 
proclaiming 1994 as "International Family Year," and designating 
15 May of each year thereafter as "International Family Day." 
  Speaking at the get-together, Wang Shoudao said: Families 
are basic units in society, and they should be allowed to play a 
role in social development and progress. Our country cannot 
carry out its socialist modernization drive without the efforts 
of each and every family. He noted: We should promote the 
Chinese nation's fine tradition of respecting the old and 
cherishing the young, build closer generational ties within the 
family, and promote familial harmony. We should improve the 
family's functions of caring for the elderly, and take better 
care of and provide for old people so that they will spend their 
remaining years peacefully. The elderly should educate the 
younger generation, impart their experiences, and make more 
contributions to social development. 
  Wang Zhaohua, chairman of the China National Committee on 
Aging, also spoke at the get-together. 
  Entertainment workers staged brilliant theatrical 
performances at the get-together. 
  The get-together was sponsored by the China National 
Committee on Aging and organized by the Hualing Publishing House 
and the Beijing Mass Information Center.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese legislators said 
the draft decision on punishing copyright violators is necessary 
for the protection of the legal rights of authors and combating 
the rampant piracy of intellectual property in the country these 
years. 
  The decision will be an important part of China's legal 
system to protect intellectual property, and be conducive to 
promoting the country's public awareness of the legal control of 
intellectual property. 
  The lawmakers were speaking at the eight-day seventh session 
of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's 
Congress (NPC) which will end Thursday [12 May], where they have 
deliberated the draft decision on punishing criminals who 
violate copyrights. 
  The NPC Standing Committee members have also aired their 
opinions on the draft decision in view of passing it at the 
earliest possible time. 
  Yang Jingheng, member of the NPC Standing Committee, said 
today that the prevailing piracy of books and audio and video 
tapes in the country has generated an adverse influence upon 
China's cooperation with the outside world. 
  "Promulgation of such a decision will be good for China's 
image in the international community," he said. 
  Yang said the protection of copyrights of computer software 
has been more critical at a time when computers are widely used. 
He said the relevant items should be specific and easy to 
operate. 
  Vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peiyao said 
production lines are purchased from abroad to duplicate compact 
discs illegally. Many local governments even protect such 
activities. 
  He proposed that the draft decision stipulate that local 
protectionists involved in copyright violations be punished. 
  Member of the NPC Standing Committee Fu Tieshan, who is also 
a bishop, said the draft decision so far lacks items to deal 
with foreigners' infringement upon Chinese authors' rights and 
should include such provisions. 
  Wang Liping, a noted music composer and member of the NPC 
Standing Committee, said that copyright violators have been 
seeking exorbitant profits and have destroyed the normal order 
of the cultural market and economic activities. 
  The penalties for them in the decision should be harsh and 
fines should be heavy to curb such crimes, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Ruiyu, who was 
convicted in August 1990 of having conspired to overthrow the 
government by means of religious activities, has been released 
on parole, sources said here today. 
  Zhang was sentenced to a term of imprisonment by the Putian 
city Intermediate People's Court of Fujian Province. 
  The court recently ruled according to law that as she had 
abided by prison regulations and had behaved well during her 
imprisonment, she was qualified for release on parole.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (AFP)--Bao Tong, the most senior 
Chinese official arrested after the 1989 pro-democracy 
demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, has been hospitalised, his 
daughter Bai Jian said Thursday. 
  "I saw my father two days ago and his health is very bad. He 
is in considerable pain and his face is badly swollen and he has 
difficulty speaking," she said by telephone, adding he had been 
transferred to a hospital in the capital from Qincheng prison 
here just over a month ago. 
  Bao, 62, an economist and former top aide to disgraced 
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, is serving a seven-year 
sentence imposed in 1992 for "counter-revolutionary propaganda 
and incitement" and "leaking important state secrets" during the 
1989 demonstrations. 
  "We don't know exactly what is wrong with him," she said, 
adding "he complains of pain in the throat and stomach because 
of inflammation of the thyroid, salivary glands and lymph nodes." 
  He has already undergone six operations for polyps in his 
intestines and colon and his swollen lymph nodes, according to 
specialists, indicate that cancer -- if present in the 17 polyps 
removed -- could have spread. 
  She said he was still being kept in solitary confinment and 
saw only his doctors. 
  "He is allowed to read, but cannot listen to the radio, or 
watch television. We are allowed to visit him once a month, up 
to a maximum of four people, and bring him books or food," she 
said. 
  She said she had no reason to suppose her father would 
benefit from the same clemency shown to dissident Wang Juntao 
who was released from prison last month and allowed to travel to 
America for medical treatment. 
  Wang was sentenced to 13 years in prison for his involvement 
in the 1989 pro-democracy movement. 
  Speaking in Washington Wednesday, Wang said his release was 
a 
"cosmetic gesture" to help China win renewal of its 
Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) trading status. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has called on China to improve 
its human rights prior to renewal of MFN and Bao is on a list of 
dissidents Washington wants to see released. 
  Bao Jian said neither she nor her brother, Bao Pu, 28, nor 
mother, Jiang Zongcao, were being harassed by the authorities.

  [Text] Hangzhou, may 12 (XINHUA) -- More and more inmates 
in China have been turned into skillful workers by the time 
their prison terms expire through prison training courses, 
prison officials said. 
  Officials attending an ongoing national conference on reform 
training here told XINHUA that some 1.2 million prisoners who 
have been released since 1984 have acquired different levels of 
diplomas and some one million of them have won technical titles 
after studying in prison training courses. 
  Only 5.39 percent of those released have committed crimes 
again, according to information at the meeting. 
  Wang Mingdi, chief of the reform bureau under the Ministry 
of 
Justice, said that Chinese prisons always respect the dignity of 
inmates, and never discriminate against or maltreat them because 
China's reformation organs assume that all criminals can be 
reformed. 
  Training courses offering lectures in law, morals, culture 
and scientific knowledge have been set up in China's 700 prisons. 
  "Skills and techniques learned in prison increase 
reemployment possibilities for prison inmates after their 
release," Wang said. "Re-employment helps cut the rate of crime 
recurrences." 
  He said Chinese prisons have achieved satisfactory results 
in 
setting up training courses and individual prisoners are 
channeled into different courses according to their knowledge 
level. 
  "The training courses have helped turn Chinese prisons into 
special training schools," he said.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Severely Punish Crimes of Theft </F>
and Destruction"] 
  [Text] The Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic 
of China pronounced severe punishments according to the law on 
criminals involved in four major cases of stealing and 
destroying railway, oil field and electric power equipment, and 
telecommunications facilities in Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Henan, 
and Hubei. The main culprits were given the death sentence. 
These criminals caused serious harm to the country and the 
people, and committed heinous crimes not to be tolerated by the 
law. 
  Railways, oil fields, electric power supply, and 
telecommunications are important, basic undertakings of the 
country, and are also the lifeblood and support of the national 
economy. The development and safety of these undertakings have 
an important bearing on the national economy, the people's 
lives, reform, and opening up. In the last few years, however, 
the crimes of stealing and destroying railway, oil field, and 
electric power equipment, and telecommunications facilities have 
been quite rampant. Apart from this, stealing and destroying 
farmland irrigation facilities and urban public facilities also 
are apparent, and these crimes are committed in larger groups, 
more openly, and with violence. Some lawbreakers have developed 
from small-scale theft and trouble to daylight armed robbery, 
defying laws both human and divine. We must pay close attention 
to, and curb these criminal offenses, which seriously trample on 
state property, damage economic construction, and endanger 
social stability; we must not tolerate them. Violations of 
criminal law must be subject to imprisonment, and no fines can 
replace imprisonments. When severe sentencing is necessary, it 
must be carried out; no softheartedness is allowed. 
  On the one hand, the people are carrying out construction 
enthusiastically, but on the other, a small number of criminals 
are wantonly engaged in theft and destruction. This situation 
must be changed as soon as possible. This year is an important 
one for establishing the socialist market economy structure and 
for maintaining the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu, kuai 
su, jian kang, 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development of the 
national economy. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
expanding the scope of opening up, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability are the main aspects of the work of the 
entire party and country. Party and government leading comrades 
in all localities and departments must have a good idea of the 
relations between reform, development, and stability; must 
"carry out two types of work simultaneously and attach equal 
importance to both"; and must take effective measures to curb 
all crimes in the course of concentrating on economic 
construction, reform, and opening up; so as to ensure smooth 
economic construction, reform, and opening up. 
  From now on, we must never relax our efforts to severely 
punish the crimes of theft and destruction. Special combat must 
be conducted in regions where such crimes are rampant, so as to 
concentrate our crackdowns on them. In this combat, we must 
rely on the government; on public security departments, 
procuratorates, and courts; as well as on the people. The 
masses must be mobilized and organized in such a manner that 
they regard themselves as masters of their own affairs in 
cherishing and protecting state property. Every civilian must be 
made to understand that state property is inviolable and that 
state property is the property of all the people and is also 
their own property. There is a need to conduct education on the 
legal system so that everyone understands what violations of law 
are and what criminal offenses are, so as to reduce and halt the 
occurrence of criminal offenses and to make everyone fight 
bravely against lawbreakers. The masses serve as a deterrent 
force against criminals. When the masses are mobilized, they 
will constitute a dragnet so that criminals have nowhere to hide.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Invention Is Aimed at Application"] </F>
  [Text] The results of the first nationwide election of 
excellent entrepreneurs with inventive achievements have already 
been released and Premier Li Peng has cordially met with the 
winners and delivered an important speech. This was an exciting 
event for the inventors and entrepreneurs in our country. We 
extend warm congratulations to these outstanding representatives 
who have won the title of excellent entrepreneurs with inventive 
achievements in this election, the first of its kind in our 
country. 
  It is not easy to create an invention and it is even harder 
to apply an invention to industrial production. We have several 
tens of thousand inventions each year but too few of these 
inventions are applied to industrial production and transformed 
into productive forces. This group of entrepreneurs with 
inventive achievements who have now been presented to the public 
have not only made inventions of their own but have also applied 
their inventions to real industrial production, producing 
excellent economic returns and social benefits. 
  Ours is a time of creation and reform which calls on more 
inventor-entrepreneurs to come forward and for more inventions 
to be applied to industrial production and commercialized. To 
transfer inventions to the industrial production process, we 
need a large number of entrepreneurs with knowledge of modern 
science and technology, modern management ability, modern 
business know-how, and a sense of creation. We hope this first 
nationwide election of excellent entrepreneurs with inventive 
achievements will give impetus to and set an example for the 
application of inventions to industrial production in our 
country. 
  The history of the world and China has proved time and again 
that science and technology are daily becoming the most active 
and important motivation for social and economic development. 
Without the development and application of science and 
technology, there would be no economic prosperity and social 
progress. If an enterprise wants to grow and take the market, 
it had better develop its own inventions and patented 
technology. Every one of the 10 prize winners of this first 
nationwide election of excellent entrepreneurs with inventive 
achievements has his patented inventions and some of them are 
even the owners of more than 60 patents each. The history of 
the rise and decline of enterprises, in China and abroad alike, 
has shown that an enterprise without its own patented technology 
can hardly win in keen market competition. 
  China is a country with an ancient civilization and a long 
history, which made splendid scientific and cultural 
achievements in ancient times. But, however splendid a nation's 
scientific and cultural achievements have been in the past, this 
nation will radiate a myriad of dazzling rays today and in the 
future only if it keeps developing its sciences and culture. We 
wholeheartedly wish that our inventors and entrepreneurs will 
unremittingly assimilate advanced scientific and technological 
knowledge, learn advanced business management know-how, 
constantly enhance improving themselves in the fields of science 
and culture, and thus carry forward the fine traditions of the 
Chinese nation amid the great tide of reform and opening up and 
make greater contributions to promoting technological progress 
and economic development of our country.

<F P=106> ["Stipulations on Management of First Import of Chemicals </F>
and the Import and Export of Toxic Chemicals"] 
  [Text] Chapter I -- General Principles 
  Article 1: In order to protect the health of human beings 
and the ecology, to strengthen management over the first import 
of chemicals and over the import and export of toxic chemicals, 
and to implement the "London Code on Exchange of Data on the 
International Trade in Chemicals (1989 amended version)," 
(London Code for short) these stipulations are drafted. 
  Article 2: Activities in the import and export of chemicals 
within the areas administered by the PRC must abide by these 
stipulations. 
  Article 3: These stipulations apply to the first import of 
chemicals, and to environmental management regarding the import 
and export of chemicals listed into the "Category of Toxic 
Chemicals Banned or Strictly Restricted in China" (the Category 
for short). 
  Food additives, medicines, drugs for use in animals, 
cosmetics, and radioactive materials need not follow these 
stipulations. 
  Article 4: The terms used in these stipulations have the 
following meanings: 
  1. "Chemicals" refers to chemical materials made by man or 
obtained from the nature, including the chemical materials 
themselves, chemical mixtures, or compenents of chemical 
compounds, as well as the substances used as industrial 
chemicals and pesticides. 
  2. "Banned chemicals" refers to chemicals that are 
completely banned because they harm health and the environment. 
  3. "Strictly restricted chemicals" refers to chemicals that 
are banned because they harm health and environment, but still 
can be used under special circumstances and with authorization. 
  4. "Toxic chemicals" refers to chemicals that, after 
entering the environment, cause harm to health and the 
environment through environmental accumulation, biological 
accumulation, biological transformation, chemical reaction, and 
so on, or which cause serious harm and potential danger to human 
beings through contact. 
  5. "The first import of chemicals" means the export to 
China, by a foreign businessman or his agent, of a chemical that 
has not been registered in China by him. Even if the same kind 
of chemical has been registered in China by another foreign 
businessman or his agent, the former case will still be viewed 
as a first import of chemicals. 
  6. "Approval granted upon prior knowledge" means that 
international transportation of banned and strictly restricted 
chemicals -- banned and strictly restricted for the purpose of 
protecting mankind's health and the environment -- must be 
carried out with the approval of the state-level department 
assigned the administrative duty by the importing country. 
  7. "Export" and "import" refer to the activities of 
performing formalities for the entry and exit of chemicals 
through the PRC's customs departments, not including transit 
shipments. 
  Chapter II -- Supervision and Management 
  Article 5: The State Environmental Protection Administration 
practices overall environmental supervision and management 
regarding the first import of chemicals and the import and 
export of toxic chemicals, takes charge of the thorough 
implementation of the procedure for granting approvals upon 
prior knowledge according to the "London Code," announces 
China's list of banned chemicals or strictly restricted toxic 
chemicals, registers the first import of chemicals, approves and 
manages the import and export of those toxic chemicals listed in 
the "Category," signs and issues "Environmental Management 
Registration Certificates for the Import/Export of Chemicals" 
and "Environmental Management Note of Advice on Allowing the 
Import/Export of Toxic Chemicals To Pass Through," and issues 
public notices on registering chemicals that are imported for 
the first time. 
  Article 6: The PRC's customs departments examine the import 
and export of toxic chemicals listed in the "Category," and 
allow them to pass on presentation of the "Environmental 
Management Note of Advice on Allowing the Import/Export of Toxic 
Chemicals To Pass Through" (see annex) issued by the State 
Environmental Protection Administration. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, 
pursuant to its duties, assists the State Environmental 
Protection Administration in examining the relevant contents of 
applications for environmental management registration regarding 
the first import of chemicals and the import and export of toxic 
chemicals, and announces the "Category of Toxic Chemicals Banned 
or Strictly Restricted in China." 
  Article 7: The State Commission for Assessing Toxic 
Chemicals, to be established by the State Environmental 
Protection Administration, is responsible for the work to 
comprehensive appraise those chemicals for which applications 
for environmental management registration are lodged for the 
purpose of import and export, and will advise the State 
Environmental Protection Administration on technical matters 
relating to the implementation of these stipulations. 
  The State Commission for Assessing Toxic Chemicals will 
consist of the management personnel from the departments in 
charge of the environment, health, agriculture, the chemical 
industry, foreign trade, commercial inspection, customs, and the 
relevant quarters, as well as technical experts; they will serve 
a three-year tenure. 
  Article 8: Following these stipulations, the local 
environmental protection departments at various levels will 
carry out environmental management and supervision of the first 
import of chemicals and the import and export of toxic chemicals.

(except for pesticides), he must file an application with the 
State Environmental Protection Administration for environmental 
management registration regarding the first import of chemicals, 
fill out the "Application for Environmental Management 
Registration Regarding the First Import of Chemicals" according 
to the regulations, and provide a test sample (generally not 
less than 250 grams) free of charge. 
  Registration and management of pesticides sold by foreign 
businessmen to China for the first time, will continue to be 
carried out according to the "Regulations on Registering 
Pesticides," and the Ministry of Agriculture will exchange 
registration information with the State Environmental Protection 
Administration according to a fixed schedule. 
  Article 10: When the State Environmental Protection 
Administration examines and approves applications for 
environmental protection registration regarding the first import 
of chemicals, it will grant environmental management 
registration permits to chemicals that meet requirements, and 
will issue the "Environmental Protection Registration 
Certificates for Import/Export of Chemicals," to allow their 
import. No registration will be performed for the chemicals 
that, on examination, are found to be unsuitable for import into 
China, and the applicants will be so notified. 
  For a chemical that is imported for the first time, and on 
examination is deemed to require more testing and a longer 
period of observation in order to determine its degree of 
danger, temporary registration can be performed, and a temporary 
registration certificate can be issued. 
  The chemicals that have not obtained environmental

exports to China any industrial chemicals or pesticides listed 
in the "Category," or when someone inside the country imports 
such chemicals from a foreign country, he must file an 
application for environmental management registration regarding 
the import of toxic chemicals with the State Environmental 
Protection Administration. For those chemicals that are allowed 
to be imported, the administration will issue the "Environmental 
Management Registration Certificate for Import/Export of 
Chemicals" and the "Environmental Management Note of Advice on 
Allowing Import/Export of Toxic Chemicals To Pass Through" (the 
"Note of Advice" for short). The "Note of Advice" follows the

Note of Advice on Allowing Import/Export of Toxic Chemicals To 
Pass Through" will be kept by the State Environmental Protection 
Administration. The second page (the original) will be given to 
the applicant for customs clearance purposes. The third page 
will be sent to the State Administration for Import and Export 
Commodity Inspection.

  [Text] Chinese-funded enterprises are investing in more 
than 20 foreign countries and regions around the world, 
according to Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing. A total of 4,497 
Chinese-funded enterprises had invested U.S.$5.16 billion around 
the world, Mr Li said yesterday. Meanwhile, China had a total 
of 174,000 foreign-funded projects with actual investment of 
U.S.$63.9 billion. 
  "China's economic reform is deepening, and its opening to 
the 
outside world has made new progress," he said. 
  The rate of overseas investment in China was growing, he 
said. Last year, the mainland saw foreign investment equal to 
the total of the previous 14 years. China would continue to 
carry out preferential treatment for foreign investors, he said. 
  However, "China will gradually implement national treatment 
towards foreign-founded enterprises, creating a competitive 
environment on an equal footing for Chinese and foreign 
investors." The country would introduce further "helpful" reform 
measures Mr Li said. "In the field of reform, we should focus 
on invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises 
by transforming their operating systems and actively setting up 
a modern enterprises by trial and error." 
  "We should strengthen and improve macro-control and 
meticulously implement various reform measures in taxation, 
finance, investment and the foreign exchange system, while 
ensuring that these are smoothly carried out," he said. 
  This year it was important for China to speed up the 
establishment of a socialist market-economy and maintain 
sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national 
economy. "Now, China is advancing toward its second goal in its 
economic and social development drive and establishing a new 
socialist market economy," he said. Mr Li was speaking at the 
opening of the '94 China Summit Meeting held in Beijing. The 
meeting provides a multilayered opportunity for Chinese and 
foreign officials, entrepreneurs and economists to meet and 
discuss economic theories and practices. 
  At the summit, Chinese Trade Minister Wu Yi launched a 
thinly 
veiled attack on the United States for politicizing trade issues 
in his keynote speech that mapped out China's trade strategy for 
the 1990s. Describing the next seven years as a "crucial 
period", Ms Wu outlined plans to shift the focus of China's 
export production, narrow regional economic disparities in the 
country and complete the construction of a legal framework 
governing foreign trade by 1997. 
  While China is committed to the "extremely heavy and arduous 
task" of economic development, Ms Wu said progress was being 
threatened by countries exerting economic pressures for 
political ends. Ms Wu also made it clear that trade disputes 
with Beijing could penalise other countries, predicting that 
total imports to China in the next seven years "may well reach 
U.S.$1 trillion".

  [Text] Speaking yesterday [24 April] at the 1994 work 
conference of the state economic information network, Chen 
Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, 
noted: The state economic information network should seize the 
opportunity to deepen reform, play its role, harness its 
potential, and better serve the twin information needs of the 
government and society. 
  Chen Jinhua said: The state economic information network was 
established in 1984 with the State Council's approval. In the 
eight years or so since its inception, the network has expanded 
to cover the entire country. More than 30 provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities directly under the central 
government; all cities with provincial-level economic 
decisionmaking power; 280 key cities and regions; and 1,500 
counties have become information hubs sufficiently outfitted 
with technology and equipment, and staffed by professional teams. 
  The network has played an important role in serving the 
party 
and government in macroeconomic policy-making, macroeconomic 
regulation and control, and macroeconomic management, as well as 
in providing information to enterprises and people in society. 
  At the conference, Gao Xingmin, director of the State 
Information Center, reviewed last year's achievements, discussed 
new problems, and laid down several key tasks for this year.

XINHUA reporter Huang Wei (7806 1218)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chen Xitong, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the 
Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, and 
leaders of some municipal departments today visited some hilly 
townships in Pinggu County in Beijing's suburb to inspect 
construction there. This was their seventh trip to hilly areas 
this year to study their ways to become affluent. 
  Hills in Beijing, which account for 62 percent of the city's 
area, have a population of 1.5 million, and the 60 relatively 
poor townships in these hills have a population of 400,000. The 
Beijing leaders maintained that hilly areas' prosperity is 
essential for Beijing to achieve a comparatively comfortable 
life faster, and Beijing must consider hilly areas' construction 
as an important goal to achieve. So far this year, Chen Xitong 
and Li Qiyan have visited the hilly Miyun, Yanqing, Changping, 
Fangshan, Mentougou, Huairou, and Pinggu Counties in Beijing's 
suburbs. While there, they talked to villagers to familiarize 
themselves with these counties' agriculture, forestry, breeding 
business, water conservancy projects, and processing industries; 
helped the local people solve problems; and discussed with local 
cadres and people on how to achieve prosperity. Chen Xitong 
noted in Liubinbao township in Yanqing County and again in 
Heishanzai township in Changping County that, to expedite 
construction, authorities in hilly areas must emancipate their 
minds, relax policies, and promote market-oriented businesses. 
To expedite development, hilly areas must proceed from 
practical needs; count primarily on tapping their rich natural 
resources; and actively produce marketable agricultural, 
forestry, livestock, and mineral goods. Chen Xitong repeatedly 
stressed that all trades and professions in Beijing should come 
to hilly areas to take a look and actively support hilly areas' 
construction so that people in hilly areas can also lead a 
comparatively comfortable life, and so that the idea of 
"exploiting mountain resources and achieving prosperity through 
the market" can be realized. He said people in Beijing should 
consider it an honor to support hilly areas and be able to 
answer the question what they have done in supporting hilly area 
development. 
  Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan also stressed in Pinggu County that 
active support should be given to those cadres who have 
foresight and the courage to start businesses. They said: We 
must encourage the peasants to count on science and technology 
and produce market-oriented goods, and to work hard to expand 
production so that hilly areas will see the prospects for 
achieving a comparatively comfortable life.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 May (XINHUA) -- After being examined and 
approved by the Central Organization Committee's General Office, 
the "Program Governing the Disposition of Functions, 
Establishment of Internal Organs, and Size of Staff in the State 
Planning Commission" has been approved by the State Council. 
The program directs that the State Planning Commission should 
strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, reduce its 
specific tasks, and accelerate the transformation of its 
functions in accordance with the objective of establishing a 
socialist market economic structure and the principles of 
changing functions, rationalizing relations, simplifying 
administration, and heightening efficiency.

monitoring, and analysis of the condition of the national 
economy, and on economic information; strengthening state 
industrial policies and the distribution of major productive 
forces; strengthening the study and formulating of plans for 
regional economic development, and strengthening supervision, 
implementation, and coordination; strengthening macroeconomic 
regulation and control by coordinating such economic levers as

Planning 
Commission plans to weaken, to delegate, or transfer to 
departments at lower levels are: Simplifying planned targets in 
all spheres and gradually lifting the planned control over 
relevant products; simplifying the examination and approval 
procedures for large and medium capital construction projects, 
projects outside the quota, and foreign investment projects; 
from now on the State Planning Commission will make arrangements 
in its annual plan on a one-time basis for nonbusiness 
investment funds, and after the arrangements, in general it will 
not accept applications requesting arrangement of funds for a 
single project; the responsibility for implementing and 
coordinating the annual plan for technical transformation 
involving the adaptation of ordnance technology to civilian use 
will be transferred to the State Economics and Trade Commission; 
and will gradually reduce the lists of import-export products 
under planned management. 
  The program directs that the State Planning Commission is a 
comprehensive department of the State Council for managing 
national economic and social development and will perform the 
following main functions: 
  -- Studying and proposing strategic targets and major 
principles and policies for national economic and social 
development; formulating a long-term, intermediate, and annual 
plan for national economic and social development, plans for the 
development of basic industries and pillar industries, and a 
plan for the issuance of national negotiable securities; and

between total demand and total supply and a balance in money 
supply (including funds inside and outside the budget, bank 
loans, funds of nonstate-owned enterprises and of individuals, 
and foreign capital); and reasonably fix and arrange the major 
ratios in the national economy.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO Reporter Pi Shuyi (4122 2885 5030) and </F>
XINHUA Reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511): "The Commodity 
Inspection Departments of Our Country Should Strictly Hold the 
Pass of the Import and Export Commodity Quality"] 
  [Text] Along with the sustained increase in the import and 
export volumes of our country's foreign trade, the task for well 
holding the pass of the import and export commodity quality 
becomes heavier and heavier with each passing day. To safeguard 
the interests of the state and consumers, the staff members and 
workers of the commodity inspection departments throughout the 
country have made efforts to carry out reforms and keep forging 
ahead and promoted the rapid development of the commodity 
inspection cause. 
  The reporters learned of the fact from the national meeting 
of commodity inspection bureau directors held on 5 May that 
positively responding to the strategy for "winning victory in 
foreign export trade through quality," commodity inspection 
departments have strictly conducted inspections and guarded the 
pass. The import and export commodities inspected last year 
were valued at $75.18 billion. Of this, 11,065 batches of 
export commodities were found unqualified, valuing at $301 
million. The goods owners were instructed to sort out or change 
their goods. Thus, the reputation of the state has been 
safeguarded. Simultaneously, 12,814 batches of import 
commodities were found unqualified, valuing at $1.53 billion. 
Commodity inspection certificates were timely issued to the 
departments concerned for claiming damages from foreign 
countries. Some $186 million of compensation funds were paid. 
According to the "regulations on banning unlawful transit of 
textile products" promulgated by the Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations and Trade, the General Customs Office, and 
the State Commodity Inspection Bureau, the commodity inspection 
departments of all localities inspected the marks of export 
textile products and prevented more than 300 batches of export 
textile products from exports. 
  To solve the problems of fake and poor-quality products 
exported through the border trade which has rapidly developed 
over the past years, the commodity inspection department and the 
departments concerned especially investigated and studied these 
problems on several occasions and reflected the situations to 
the State Council in a timely manner. The commodity inspection 
department, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and 
Trade, and the General Customs Office jointly issued the 
"Circular on Strictly Banning the Exports of Fake and 
Poor-Quality Commodities," and revised and made public the 
"methods for inspecting the commodities exported and imported 
through the border trade." Simultaneously, the establishment of 
commodity inspection organs at border trade ports was 
accelerated. Methods for linking on-the-spot inspections with 
pursuing for a permanent control were adopted to manage the 
commodity inspections. Strict measures, including expanding the 
scale of sample surveys and turning over goods for inspections, 
were adopted to especially inspect the commodities relating to 
the people's safety and public health, the ordinary commodities, 
and the commodities easily mixed with fake commodities. The 
commodity inspection department also worked in coordination with 
the departments concerned to strictly handle a number of 
enterprises and businessmen that manufactured and sold fake and 
poor-quality export commodities. Thus, the trend that fake and 
poor-quality commodities were wantonly exported through border 
trade channels has effectively been brought under control. 
  The commodity inspection organs at various levels have 
positively conducted self-reform. Some commodity inspection 
bureaus changed their laboratories with conditions into 
relatively independent inspection entities which could join the 
market competition. A small number of inspection and appraisal 
entities were changed into independent corporations. Market 
intermediate organizations, including quality attestation and 
property appraisal organizations, were growing up. On the basis 
of this, some commodity inspection bureaus begin to 
appropriately separate administrative management functions from 
specific inspection functions. To suit the demands for 
expanding the scale of opening the coastal and border areas and 
the areas along the rivers to the outside world, last year, 31 
new commodity inspection organizations were established, 26 
preparatory organizations were approved, and six Sino-foreign 
jointly invested inspection and appraisal organizations were set 
up.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yu Yingrui (0151 3841 3843)] </F>
  [Text] Xiamen, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- At the national 
conference on market and commodity circulation, which just ended 
in Xiamen, participants called for establishing a new regulatory 
and control system by enacting new regulatory and control rules 
and employing new regulatory and control mechanisms in line with 
the principle of a market economy. They also called for proper 
regulation and control of such important commodities as grain, 
cotton, edible oil, sugar, meat, vegetables, chemical 
fertilizer, steel products, and petroleum products, which have a 
bearing on people's lives and economic development. 
  Wang Yiping, a responsible person of the State Economics and 
Trade Commission, said: Regulating and controlling market 
operations is an important part of the operation of the economy 
as a whole and is crucial to ensuring steady economic 
development and the smooth progress of reform in all areas. As 
the majority of commodities have been decontrolled, in dealing 
with major problems that have emerged and with possible major 
problems that may emerge in the operation of markets, it is 
necessary to regulate and control market prices by applying 
economic means and monetary policies and guide market depand so 
as to achieve a balance between supply and demand. 
  Wang Yiping said: In establishing new regulatory and control 
rules and regulations under the present circumstances, first, we 
should establish a national reserve system and a local reserve 
system. The central reserve system's main task is regulating 
and controlling social supply and demand and regulating and 
controlling market problems that will affect the situation as a 
whole; the local reserve system's main task is regulating and 
controlling the operation of markets in localities to ensure 
market stability there. Second, we should establish a system of 
risk funds for important commodities. The central authorities 
have studied and established a system of risk funds for grain 
and is planning to establish risk funds for meat, vegetables, 
and other nonstaple food. Some localities have established 
their own risk funds. After commodities are decontrolled, 
production will be protected and market regulation and control 
will be flexible and effective only if a system of risk funds is 
established. Third, price regulation and control should be 
conducted by making full use of international and domestic 
markets, with emphasis on coordinating import-export policies. 
Following the elimination of the dual-track system for foreign 
exchange, the reform of the foreign trade system, and the 
connection between the international and domestic markets, 
imports and exports are playing an increasingly stronger 
influence on the operation of markets. It is necessary to 
establish a unified coordinating system for policies on the 
import and export of important commodities and means of 
production, and to coordinate, in accordance with changes in the 
international and domestic markets, the application of customs 
tariffs and value-added taxes as well as necessary nontariff 
policies and measures, and to promptly readjust the 
specifications and quantity of import and export commodities, so 
as to promote the balanced and coordinated development of the 
international and domestic markets. Fourth, we should establish 
a market monitoring system to monitor the production, marketing, 
and stocks of important commodities and means of production, as 
well as to monitor changes in their prices, and also establish a 
comprehensive information forecasting and monitoring network 
that can provide feedback flexibly. Through such a system and 
network we can do quantitative analysis on a regular basis, 
promptly discover market problems suggesting a new development, 
and put forward corresponding regulatory and control measures or 
suggestions. In this way, market regulation and control we be 
carried out promptly, accurately, and effectively.

<F P=106> [By Foo Choy Peng] </F>
  [Text] China's state enterprises face a harsher policy of 
survival of the fittest under the latest credit guidelines of 
the State Economic and Trade Commission and the People's Bank of 
China. 
  Deserving industrial enterprises are to receive the same 
level of--if not more--loans as last year while some of those 
with no hope of returning to profits will see the previous heavy 
transfusions of bank loans cut off. 
  Analysts say the latest credit policy statements underscore 
a 
more determined approach to prevent moribund industrial 
enterprises drawing off funds which could be better used by 
those which are making profits, or showing signs of making real 
financial progress. 
  The latest guidelines state that loans to profitable state 
enterprises in the next two years generally should not be less 
than last year's level. Indeed, more loans could be given to 
the money-making enterprises if bank deposits go up this year 
and next year. 
  Money-losing enterprises which could reduce their losses in 
the next two years should continue to receive loans from banks 
to cover their working capital. "Appropriate support should be 
given to enterprises which could reduce their losses or even 
turn around in these two years to help them tide over their 
difficulties," says a report. "Credit should be tightened for 
those with no hope of turning around and whose assets cannot 
sustain their debts so that they could face bankruptcy." 
  These guidelines come at a time when foreign economists are 
increasingly concerned that the biggest obstacles to the 
country's economic reform programme are the moribund state 
enterprises which still make up a sizeable portion of its 
industrial base. 
  The fear that the political implications of removing them as 
burdens to the state could prove too arduous--at least, while 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping is alive and no one is prepared 
to make stern decisions. 
  A recent report by Baring Securities, for example, points 
out 
that there are 500 enterprises which lose more than 500 million 
yuan (about HK$445.5 million) a year. 
  Tang Xu, deputy director of the Graduate School of the 
People's Bank, said while even some money-losing enterprises 
would continue to receive loans for working capital, they were 
under increasing pressure to tighten their operations. 
  "The lending policy is certainly tighter now, as 
unprofitable 
enterprises will have to convince banks that they can become 
leaner and fitter in order to get loans," Mr Tang said. He 
added that as the country had yet to have a social security 
system in place, it would be unthinkable to force all 
money-losing enterprises to go under. "How do you take care of 
those who are laid off? That is a bigger social question which 
the central authorities will have to handle." 
  State enterprises essentially still take care of the 
cradle-to-grave needs of their employees, and if many are forced 
to close, would become a politically destabilising influence. 
Indeed, some Hong Kong analysts believe that unemployment could 
become a potentially more serious problem than inflation, if not 
handled well.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--News from 
the China State Information Center indicates that the State 
Structural Reform Commission is drafting a program for 
transferring state-owned enterprises' property rights in order 
to standardize the practice of property rights transfer. 
  The individual revealed that the central government is 
encouraging small state-owned enterprises to transfer their 
property rights and affirmed that there are no ideological 
obstacles, even to the transfer of large and medium state-owned 
enterprises' property rights. Because China's economic 
construction is suffering a serious capital shortage, the income 
from transferring property rights will be used in urgent and 
important sectors of the national economy. Therefore, state 
asset losses will not be a problem as property rights are 
transferred; on the contrary, the transformation of tangible 
assets into monetary assets will be quite beneficial to an 
industrial adjustment. 
  An expert pointed out that the following merits attention in 
any discussion of property rights transfer: State assets should 
be scientifically and correctly appraised; payments should be 
made in a lump and no installments are allowed; asset ownership 
should be clearly defined; and, after an enterprise transfers 
its property rights, overall arrangements should be made for its 
staff members' and workers' employment and labor insurance and 
the pensions of its retired personnel.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--To meet the 
needs of enterprise reform, especially those of reorganizing 
state large and medium enterprises into joint-stock companies, 
the Chinese Government department concerned days ago released 
explicit regulations on converting state assets into shares, 
stressing the need to assess assessment before reorganizing 
state enterprises into joint stock companies. 
  The regulations say that before issuing new shares the 
adjusted net book price of the enterprise assets should be 
converted into the original shareholders' interest. If the net 
book price is not all converted into shares, the remaining net 
assets price should be regarded as a part of capital surplus 
rather than being converted into liabilities. 
  In the meantime, the ratio at which enterprise assets are 
converted into shares and the multiple of assets-turned shares 
[zhe gu bi lu he zhe gu bei shu 2124 5140 3024 3764 0735 2124 
5140 0223 2422], together with the planned program for issuing 
new shares and the issue price, should be subject to 
examination. That is to say, the multiple rate of premium at 
which new shares are issued [xin gu fa xing yi jia bei lu 2450 
5140 4099 5887 3300 0116 0223 3764] should not be smaller than 
the multiple of assets-turned shares; otherwise, the net book 
price of the enterprise assets of original shareholders will not 
be fully expressed. 
  The regulations also stressed that the premium at which new 
shares are issued should be raised as high as possible to fully 
reflect the value of the original shareholders' interest.

projects will be managed and operated by the foreign businessmen 
during the contract period, which lasts 15 years or so, and the 
Chinese side will collect taxes. At the expiration of the 
contract period, the entire projects will be returned to the 
Chinese side. According to a briefing, foreign investors can 
have access to power plants, railways, highways, and other

  [Text] Beijing, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Zhu Li, secretary 
general of the China Securities Supervision and Administration 
Committee, today told a XINHUA reporter: With the State 
Council's approval, the State Council's General Office recently 
relayed the State Council Securities Commission's six-point 
concrete opinion on halting futures trading in steel products, 
sugar, and coal: 
  1. Standardized futures contract trading in steel products 
and sugar will be halted. Exchanges already engaged in futures 
trading in steel products and sugar will stop issuing futures 
contracts after the end of October. Trading under contracts for 
current futures trading will be allowed to continue until the 
day of settlement. 
  2. Trading under nonstandardized, long-term contacts may be 
continued; however, illegal sales of contracts at a profit to 
increase prices indirectly will be strictly prohibited. 
  3. It is suggested that the Ministry of Coal Industry issue 
a 
circular urging all coal exchanges and wholesale markets to stop 
designing and listing standardized futures contracts for coal 
varieties. 
  4. From now on, no exchanges will be allowed to decide on 
their own to list new futures varieties. The listing of any new 
variety must be reported to the China Securities Supervision and 
Administration Committee for examination and approval after its 
justification is fully proven. 
  5. No banking institution may issue letters of guarantee 
regarding futures trading. All futures exchanges are forbidden 
to accept bank-issued letters of guarantee for use as cash 
deposits. 
  6. When futures prices fluctuate drastically, the China 
Securities Supervision and Administration Committee may ask 
exchanges to raise the proportion of cash deposits to those 
prices. 
  Zhu Li said: The State Council's General Office urges 
people's governments in all localities and relevant departments 
to follow and implement the foregoing opinion, and to actively 
but steadily carry out work arising from its issuance to ensure 
social stability and the normal performance of various economic 
tasks.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- A top Chinese securities 
official said here today that China will expand issues of 
B-shares in a bid to reactivate the sluggish market, and 
strategically the markets of A-shares and B-shares will merge in 
the future. 
  "We are adopting policies to allow companies to expand the 
issue of B-shares, because the present B-share market is too 
small to meet the enterprise demand for foreign fund supply," 
said Liu Hongru, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory 
Commission (CSRC), speaking at the '94 China summit meeting that 
opened here yesterday. 
  B-shares were devised in 1991 for overseas investors. 
Denominated in Chinese yuan, the shares are traded in U.S. or 
Hong Kong dollars only. 
  By the end of 1993 there were 42 companies issuing B-shares, 
with a total capital stock of 3.01 billion yuan and raising 1.2 
billion in U.S. dollars. 
  Liu did not disclose the projected issue volume of B-shares 
in 1994, but sources close to the CSRC said that at least 50 new 
B-shares will be listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen this year, 
doubling last year's figure. 
  The securities authorities are also considering expanding 
the 
investor base by allowing enterprises with B-shares to issue ADR 
(American depositary receipts), convertible bonds and other 
stock-related paper to invigorate transactions and raise more 
capital. 
  Liu acknowledged that the long-term division into A-shares 
and B-shares of the country's securities could trigger many 
problems. 
  "From the view of progress, the two markets should be 
merged," said Liu. "However, the free convertibility of the 
renminbi is the most essential prerequisite for the merger." 
  Liu noted that some foreign companies have expressed the 
wish 
to issue stocks on the Chinese securities market with some 
planning to issue shares similar to B-shares and some preferring 
A-shares. 
  "Right now our market is not open to foreign companies, 
though in the long run it will be," said Liu. "But we are 
studying schemes put forward by foreign firms." 
  According to the CSRC chairman, opening the Chinese market 
to 
foreign firms requires mapping out specific laws and regulations 
to standardize the issuing and listing of foreign companies and 
determining which accounting code foreign companies should adopt. 
  "We must specify what kinds of foreign companies are 
eligible 
to be listed in China and how to supervise them," he said. 
  He added, "the impending task is to study how to deal with 
the problem of free flow of capital while the renminbi is still 
not freely convertible and foreign exchange is still controlled."

<F P=106> [By Tan Hongkai: "State Services Still Require Support"] </F>
  [Text] A major step in the current wave of government 
reform is to wean nonadministrative establishments from state 
agencies and "socialize" their service functions. 
  As a result, many government-sponsored state agencies in 
charge of nonexecutive issues are told to earn their own money. 
  For some, however, it is very hard to make profits, at least 
for the time being. 
  Management involved with subsidization of plant protection, 
water and soil conservation, pest control, and technology 
promotion fall into such a category, said Li Zhensheng, former 
vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
  With these people struggling to eke out a living, "few 
bother 
about their proper duties," he said. 
  Much of the damage caused by insect pests and crop diseases 
in recent years Li attributes to the crippled state agencies in 
charge of rural technical promotion. 
  Many participants to the 1994 session of the Chinese 
People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) criticized a tendency 
in some local authorities to shirk responsibility in the name of 
reform. 
  Agrotechnology -- the application of science to farming 
problems -- was neglected by cadres who were misinterpreting the 
reform message as profits and good-looking financial accounts. 
  Agrotechnology promotion agencies should be retained and 
strengthened, they contended, to support agriculture -- the most 
important and fragile industry in China. 
  "Although we've been affiliated to the state, we are only 
responsible for technological promotion. Such nonexecutive 
agencies as ours should go public in the long run. But there 
should be a process," said Zhang Yaozong, director of the 
National Centre for Agrotechnology Promotion (NCAP), in an 
interview with CHINA DAILY. 
  "Though this time reforms are targeted at reducing the 
government's direct involvement in economic activities, many 
local governments gave priority to reducing financial burdens," 
said Xu Weisheng, deputy director of NCAP. 
  The problem is that some local farm authorities have 
deserted 
their responsibilities instead of diversifying management to 
ensure main duties. 
  With some agriculture-related agencies at the county level 
being dismembered or merged, some funds earmarked for 
agrotechnological promotion have been diverted to balance the 
books and make up for financial deficits, Nie Chuang, a division 
chief with NCAP, pointed out. 
  NCAP officials are disappointed the Law on Promotion of 
Agrotechnologies has not been well implemented. 
  The 1993 law urges local governments to ensure setting up 
county level farm management with personnel and financial 
support. 
  NCAP's opinions are echoed by researchers at the Institute 
of 
Political Science (IOPS) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
  "A latent motive behind the initial call for government 
reforms was mounting financial pressure," said Chen Hui, IOPS 
researcher. "That is why burden reduction receives priority over 
functional transfer." 
  Chen and his fellows, in consensus with the NCAP, appealed 
for a step-by-step procedure while stressing the necessity of 
current reforms. 
  The government should not relinquish its control before a 
socialized service system is set up, according to Bai Gang, a 
senior IOPS expert in charge of county-level research programmes. 
  Closing government agencies and diverting their staff have 
been repeated several times in China's governmental reforms. 
But each round was followed by an even more cumbersome 
administrative body. 
  Zhang Dongchang, also an IOPS researcher, insisted that mere 
simplification cannot solve all the problems at county level. 
  "This approach excelled mostly because of its immediate 
effects in poverty-stricken counties," he said. "Since local 
finance can see rapid improvements after streamlining the 
payroll, the results are of course conspicuous. 
  "But excessive publicity has made this a model for all 
areas." 
  Placing emphasis on the peculiar situation of the transition 
from a planned economy to a market one, they appealed for an 
even stronger role for the government. 
  "The most important factor that has enabled sustained 
prosperity in many other nations is sophisticated control by the 
government," Chen said. 
  The most basic functions of any county government is the 
development of its agriculture, they said. 
  "The central government must reinforce its intervention 
during the transitional period to ensure a smooth and 
well-coordinated transfer," Bai said. 
  The embarrassment of agrotechnical departments, in their 
eyes, exposes local governments' indifference to agriculture. 
  Emphasis on numerical criteria in official accounts also 
explains local cadres' eagerness to neglect the basics. 
  Work performance evaluations generally emphasize output 
value 
and tax-profits turnover. Agriculture, however, always needs 
government subsidies. 
  "The government's role in such fields as rural education, 
health care, family planning, and technical services should not 
be weakened for the time being," Bai said. "Otherwise, there 
will only be chaos." 
  But Wang Qinfeng, with the General Office of the Central 
Organization and Establishment Committee, sees a brighter 
picture. 
  Difficulties of rural technical agencies are just like the 
throes of childbirth, painful but temporary, according to Wang. 
  "If people knew more about local conditions, they would draw 
a different conclusion," he said. 
  He stressed that pilot reforms were carried out not only in 
poor regions but also involved economically-advanced areas. His 
committee has never asked local governments to follow any 
identical model. 
  "Our policy is to encourage early separation of nonexecutive 
branches from the chains of government offices in localities 
where conditions are ripe, instead of making it compulsory 
everywhere," he said. "And there should be a process." 
  Problems do exist in the course of reforms, he noted, but 
most derive from policy distortion and practical implementation. 
Current problems can only be solved through further reforms. 
  Misuse of funds, for example, has little to do with the 
reforms themselves, he said. 
  "So far as I know, the experiments are generally 
successful," 
he said. 
  Qin's optimism is based on the focus of debates that it is 
not whether but how the nation should push forward reforms. 
  Difficulties of agrotechnical service agencies are not 
peculiar in such comprehensive reforms in a populous country 
like China. 
  Losses of vested interests are inevitable in the transition 
from the old to the new mechanism. As long as reforms are still 
on the right track, the agony is worthwhile. 
  The most essential task now seems to be how to ensure reform 
measures that are not misinterpreted.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Technical associations 
have become very active among Chinese farmers as more and more 
of them want to learn technical expertise and information so as 
to get rich faster. 
  According to the Ministry of Agriculture, such associations 
started to flourish in the 1980s, with their focus first solely 
on grain production in the ten provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, 
Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Guangdong and 
Sichuan. 
  Since then, such associations have expanded to different 
areas, including capital investment, technology, production, 
processing, and supply and marketing, as farmers come to depend 
more and more on the market. 
  A recent survey by the ministry shows that seven percent of 
these associations focus on technology extension, over 50 
percent of them concentrate on various production services, and 
another 36 percent provide complete sets of help for farmers 
from production to marketing. 
  The best known of such organizations is the Changcheng 
township vegetable association of Zhucheng city in east China's 
Shandong Province. As most of 2,400 household members are well 
versed in vegetable production, the association helps them with 
technical training, introducing fine seeds and supplying 
services for vegetable processing and sales. Farmers from other 
villages make up the majority of the association members, as 
they want to learn more from the Changcheng farmers. 
  Another outstanding example is the Edible Fungus Association 
in Feixiang county, in north China's Hebei province. The 
association embraces 14 percent of the households in 100 
villages specializing in edible fungus production.

  [Text] Fuzhou, May 12 (XINHUA) -- A foundation-stone-laying 
ceremony was held Tuesday for the Dongshan Economic and 
Technological Development Zone in Dongshan county, Fujian 
Province. 
  The zone is separated by the sea from Taiwan and lies 
between 
the Xiamen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Fujian and the Shantou 
SEZ in neighboring Guangdong Province. 
  Approved by the State Council, the 10-sq-km zone will focus 
on the growth of such industries as food processing, 
electronics, tourism souvenirs and new building materials, 
according to an official of the zone administration commission. 
  Chinese and overseas investors will also be encouraged to 
expand the financial, commercial and real estate sectors in the 
zone, the official said. 
  He said that the Dongshan county government is doing 
everything within its power to create a fine investment 
environment in the zone. 
  To date, the zone has invested 40 million yuan in building 
three km of roads and a substation, and installing a 
program-controlled switchboard with 6,000 lines, he said. 
  A port in the zone has opened to foreign ships, he said. 
With two berths for ships of 5,000 dwt, it is capable of 
handling 9,000 standard containers annually. 
  Regular container ship services between Dongshan and Hong 
Kong began May 1 this year.

  [Text] Xiamen, May 11 (CNS) -- Mayor of Xiamen, Mr. Hong 
Yongshi, speaking yesterday at a meeting on the mobilization of 
efforts to speed the development of the export-oriented economy 
in the special economic zone city in Fujian Province, stressed 
that Xiamen must further improve its environment for investment, 
grasp the city's advantages and rebuild its image in order to 
develop its export-oriented economy to a new stage. 
  According to the mayor, economic operations in the city had 
been on the whole good in the first four months of this year 
with its industrial output value increased by 35.4 percent over 
the same period of last year, fixed assets investment by 89 
percent and export value by 20 percent. 
  For various reasons, the special economic zone had suffered 
a 
decline in the introduction of foreign capital in the first four 
months with only 163 contracts on the use of foreign funds being 
signed in this period, a drop of 15.5 percent over the same 
period last year and a total of foreign investment of U.S.$415 
million, down by 29.4 percent, but its actual utilization of 
foreign capital increased by 7.2 percent, reflecting that most 
of the indicators for the introduction of foreign capital in the 
city were lower than those in other special economic zones in 
the country. 
  Mr. Hong attributed the decline in the introduction of 
foreign capital in the city to the unstable environment for 
investment there besides objective factors including a 
large-scale decline of investment in the real estate industry, 
the shifting of foreign investment from coastal areas to inland 
areas in the country and various limits imposed by the Taiwan 
authorities on its investment in the mainland. 
  The mayor called for a solution to problems in the 
environment for investment through means of reform in order to 
curb the declining trend in foreign capital introduction in the 
city. He also said that the city must make itself trusted by 
foreign businessmen and all contracts, once signed, must be 
implemented even if in the circumstances there was a loss for 
the Chinese side.

  [Text] Nanjing, in Jiangsu Province, recently adopted a 
series of new measures allowing foreign entrepreneurs to 
contract large and medium-sized loss-making state-owned 
enterprises. 
  It was learned that three large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises based in Nanjing, each having assets valued over 40 
million yuan, already had been contracted by Hong Kong and Thai 
entrepreneurs. 
  The foreign-contracted enterprises are allowed to employ 
advanced foreign management measures; institute advanced foreign 
operational mechanisms; and enjoy full decision-making powers in 
terms of production, supply and marketing, personnel, finance, 
management, operation, and so on, on the premise of assuming 
full responsibility for the wages of staff and workers, for 
production and operational expenses and funds, for state taxes, 
for contracted minimum profits, as well as for profits turned 
over to the authorities at a yearly incremental rate. The 
foreign-contracted enterprises are free to retain surplus 
profits after turning over the minimum profits to the state in 
accordance with the contracts.

  [Text] Since the beginning of this year, in line with the 
principles set forth by the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council on `seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding 
opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability,' 
the provincial party committee and the provincial government 
have positively and steadily promoted the reform in various 
fields, thus effecting a relatively rapid increase in 
production, construction, circulation, and consumption, and 
keeping on the fine economic trend emerged since last winter. 
In the first quarter of this year, the province's gross 
domestic product was 66 billion yuan, an increase of 18.3 
percent over the corresponding period last year. Of this, the 
added value of the primary industry was 6.7 billion yuan, an 
increase of 6.7 percent; that of the secondary industry was 41.6 
billion yuan, an increase of 20.6 percent; and that of the 
tertiary industry was 17.7 billion yuan, an increase of 18.7 
percent. Economic development showed the following 
characteristics: 
  The increase trend of industrial production was strong, and 
production and marketing grew simultaneously. In the first 
quarter of this year, the province's industry at or above the 
township level realized 89.2 billion yuan in sales value, an 
increase of 30.9 percent over the same period last year, and the 
marketing rate of products was 91.6 percent, an increase of 1.57 
percentage points. Such major light industrial products as 
bicycles, electric fans, clothes, television sets, and washing 
machines registered increases ranging from 40 to 80 percent. 
And, such heavy industrial products as rolled steel, coal, soda 
ash continued to increase steadily. 
  Crops were doing well, and livestock production developed 
steadily. Since the beginning of spring, party committees and 
governments at all levels in the province have conscientiously 
implemented the guidelines of the national rural work conference 
and the demands set by the telephone conference on spring 
production held by the provincial government, thus giving rise 
to a relatively good situation in agricultural production. 
Wheat was doing well. Assignment of cotton fields was carried 
out rapidly. Acreage sown to oil-bearing seeds and vegetables 
increased greatly. Animal husbandry developed in an all-round 
way, and the large-scale breeding of pigs, cattle, and sheep 
developed rapidly. 
  Increase trend in investment remained vigorous, and 
investment structure tended to be reasonable. State-owned units 
throughout the province invested 3.94 billion yuan in fixed 
assets, up by 38.2 percent over the corresponding period last 
year, or an increase of 15 percent if price rise factor is 
deducted. Major characteristics of investment were: the 
investment in the projects undertaken by the central authorities 
increased rapidly, the investment in local projects increased 
slowly, the newly initiated projects decreased, and investment 
structure improved. Investment in the energy industry increased 
rapidly. Of this, investment in coal and power industries 
increased by 170 and 130 percent respectively. 
  Sales on market tended to be brisk steadily, and urban and 
rural markets were thriving. In the first quarter of this year, 
the volume of retail sales of consumer goods totaled 24.86 
billion yuan, an increase of 28 percent over the corresponding 
period last year, with is growth speed faster than the average 
national level. There was an ample supply of commodities on 
markets, and the people's shopping mentality was stable. The 
increase in rural markets was accelerated, and the gaps between 
the increase margins of urban and rural markets were narrowed. 
The transaction volume of country fair trade in urban and rural 
areas increased at a high speed. In the first quarter of this 
year, the transaction volume of the province's urban and rural 
country fair trade amounted to 19.45 billion yuan, up by 92.4 
percent over the same period last year. 
  Foreign trade maintained its steady increase. In the first 
quarter of this year, the total volume of foreign export trade 
reached $1.36 billion, an increase of 12.8 percent over the same 
period last year. Utilization of foreign funds entered the 
stage of substantial development. In three months, a total of 
1,040 projects using foreign funds were newly signed, with the 
contracted volume of foreign funds reaching $458 million. 
Because the foreign investments for the projects signed last 
year was put in place one after another, the foreign funds 
actually utilized in the first quarter of this year reached $306 
million, an increase of 42 percent over the same period last 
year. 
  Revenues increased steadily, and the difference in social 
credit was narrowed. The provincial budgetary financial 
revenues amounted to 2.02 billion yuan, an increase of 27.5 
percent, and expenditures amounted to 2.91 billion yuan, an 
increase of 23.5 percent. By the end of March, credit savings 
deposits of the province amounted to 194.3 billion yuan, 13.26 
billion yuan more than the figure at the beginning of this year; 
and loans amounted to 209 billion yuan, 3.12 billion yuan more 
than that at the beginning of this year. 
  Living standards of the people continued to improve. In the 
first quarter of this year, the total payroll of workers and 
staff throughout the province was 7.46 billion yuan, an increase 
of 31.5 percent over the same period last year, and the average 
wage was 872 yuan, an increase of 27.7 percent. Living 
standards of urban and rural residents also improved obviously. 
  At present, some problems remain to the province's economic 
life. For instance, commodity prices have continued to pick up 
in high place, the efficiency of industrial production has 
declined, the range of deficits has been expanded, and the 
prices of means of agricultural production increased. The 
provincial departments concerned are adopting effective measures 
to gradually resolve these problems with a view to pressing 
forward the provincial economy in an even more healthy and 
orderly manner.

  [Text] Shandong Province has vigorously strengthened the 
building of infrastructure facilities by giving consideration to 
the interests of foreign traders, thus creating a fine 
environment for foreign countries to run plants and do business 
in the province. Over the past several years, thanks to the 
implementation of the strategy of promoting the development of 
the entire economy with an export-oriented economy, Shandong's 
opening up has extended from eastern coastal areas to western 
inland areas, and the new pattern of opening to all directions 
and levels has taken shape basically. Thus far, eight cities and 
prefectures and 56 counties, cities, and districts have been 
delimited as the coastal economic open region, with its area 
accounting for 40 percent of the province's total territory, its 
population accounting for 38 percent of the province's total, 
and its GNP accounting for 61.8 percent of the province's total. 
Now, this coastal economic open region has become one of the 
largest open regions in China's eastern coastal areas. Qingdao, 
Yantai, and Weihai economic and technological development zones 
have given rise to the new framework of modernized cities. Nine 
high and new technology industrial development zones in Jinan, 
Weihai, and some other localities have begun to take shape and 
become the areas where high science and technology industries 
develop in a concentrated manner. 
  According to statistics, in 1993 the province set a record 
high in utilizing foreign funds, with the foreign funds utilized 
equal to the total in the previous 14 years. In 1993, the 
number of newly approved projects using foreign funds surpassed 
8,000, the amount of contracted foreign funds reached $7.55 
billion, and the foreign funds actually utilized reached $2.26 
billion, respectively showing an increase of 73 percent, 81 
percent, and 83 percent over 1992. Among the projects using 
foreign funds, the projects with optimized structure, high 
grades, large amount of investment, advanced technology, and 
close connections with industries increased obviously. Of them, 
the projects using more than $10 million each numbered 257. 
  Thus far, 65 countries and regions in the world have 
invested 
in Shandong, and the foreign investment sphere has extended to 
commerce, retail sales, and finance. Yamaguchi Bank in Japan 
and (Huifeng) Bank in Hong Kong have opened their banking organs 
in Qingdao. (Xiri) Bank and (Rixin) Stock Company in Japan, 
(Baosheng) Corporation in Hong Kong, (Bada) Corporation in the 
Britain, and the Long-Term Credit Bank in the ROK have 
established representative offices in Shandong.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The shift to a market 
economy has helped speed up the growth of the private sector in 
south China's Guangdong Province, according to the provincial 
administration for industry and commerce. 
  An administration official said that during the first 
quarter 
of 1994, 4,484 private companies were set up throughout 
Guangdong, a national pace-setter in reforms and opening to the 
outside world. 
  That figure brought the number of private companies in 
Guangdong to 50,000, 10.5 percent more than at the end of 1993, 
the official said. 
  He said that Guangdong had 25,000 private companies at the 
end of 1991, adding that 7,070 more such companies sprang up in 
the following year. 
  Last year saw the establishment of 13,000 such companies, he 
said. 
  Private companies have a total registered capital of 21.3 
billion yuan. "These companies have become a main force behind 
Guangdong's economic growth," he said. 
  Guangdong has some 4,000 private companies with a registered 
capital exceeding one million yuan each, he said. 
  To date, 40 private enterprise groups have been formed 
throughout Guangdong, he added. 
  According to the official, many government employees have 
abandoned their iron rice bowls, or lifelong jobs, to launch 
their own companies to provide services in advertising, real 
estate development, computers and consultancy.

  [Text] According to the Guangdong Customhouse, our 
province was bullish about its import and export trade in the 
first quarter of this year. The total value of our province's 
import and export trade in this quarter amounted to about $16.2 
billion. Both imports and exports increased by more than 20 
percent over the same period last year, with a favorable import 
balance of $150 million, thus putting an end to last year's 
export deficit situation. In export-volume terms, Shenzhen 
ranked first among other cities in the province, with an export 
volume of $3.1 billion; Guangzhou ranked second, with an export 
volume of close to $1.1 billion, and Dongguan City ranked third, 
with an export volume of $1 billion. Shenzhen, Dongguan, and 
Guangzhou were the three top importing cities in our province. 
  In Guangdong's foreign trade, exports exceeded imports in 
the 
first quarter of this year, indicating that after the state 
unified exchange rates this year, import demand, which has 
remained high for many years, had been initially alleviated. 
Meanwhile, as state export encouragement measures, such as duty 
refunds, were further implemented, general export trade began to 
bottom out and gained upward momentum.

  [Text] According to the Shenzhen Commission for 
Restructuring Economy, the city soon will conduct comprehensive 
experiments in 20 selected enterprises on the establishment of a 
modern enterprise system. It will open up a new path by summing 
up the experience gained in these experiments and lay a 
foundation for the city to be the first in the country to 
establish a market economy structure. The main contents of these 
experiments include the establishment of the enterprise 
legal-person system, the limited liability system, and the 
scientific management system; the effective solution of such 
crucial problems as property, personnel, and distribution 
rights; and the adoption of appropriate supporting measures. 
While carrying out these experiments, the city will continue to 
do a good job in the work in three ways: 
  1. The city will reappraise the stocks and assets of 
enterprises, register their property rights, harmonize property 
rights relationships, and institute and perfect an enterprise 
legal-person system. 
  2. It will reform and improve the enterprise internal 
leadership system, and will set up boards of shareholders and 
boards of directors, as well as a scientific leadership 
structure of checks and balances -- under which functions and 
powers are clearly defined -- between [words indistinct]. 
  3. It will improve the enterprise distribution system and 
set up a rational encouragement mechanism.

  [Text] On 8 May, the regional party committee and people's 
government held a regional family planning work meeting in 
Nanning to relay and implement the spirit of the Fourth Central 
Discussion on Family Planning Work, analyze the present 
population situation, unify understanding, exchange experiences, 
and to study and make arrangements for family planning work in 
our region this year. Regional party, government, and military 
leaders who attended the meeting included [provincial party 
Secretary] Zhao Fulin, [provincial Governor] Cheng Kejie, 
[congress head] Liu Mingzu, Ding Tingmo, Li Zhenqian, Peng 
Guikang, Li Enchao, Ma Qingsheng, Yang Jichang, Zhi Zhaotang, 
Chen Ren, Huang Yuyang, Mao Guobin, Rui Qingkai, and others. 
  The meeting was presided over by regional party Deputy 
Secretary Ding Tingmo. Regional Chairman Cheng Kejie first 
relayed the spirit of the Fourth Central Discussion on Family 
Planning Work and made arrangements for family planning work in 
our region this year. He pointed out: Leaders at all levels 
must fully understand the current population situation in our 
region and further grasp family planning work in a firm and 
effective manner. Last year, thanks to the concern and 
leadership of the party committees and governments at all 
levels, our region fulfilled the population control plan 
assigned by the state. This was not an easy job. However, we 
must realize soberly that the present population situation in 
our region is still grave as is mainly reflected in the 
following: 
  1. Our population base is large and comprises many young 
people with a rapid population growth rate; 
  2. Our foundation for family planning work is weak; 
  3. There are new situation and problems arising in family 
planning work in the course of establishing a socialist market 
economic system; in particular, an increase in the floating 
population in cities and towns has made our family planning work 
more difficult. 
  We must seriously deal with these problems. We must 
persistently and unswervingly treat control over population 
growth as a fundamental task in economic development. Cheng 
Kejie continued: Our region's targets for population control 
this year have been examined, discussed, and approved by the 
Second Session of the Eighth Regional People's Congress. In 
other words, our natural population growth rate must be 
controlled within the range of 14.04 per mill. The birth rate, 
population natural growth rate, and additional births rate must 
be lower than last year. The birth control rate must be 
increased to over 80 percent. To fulfill the abovementioned 
targets, the regional people's government urges leaders at all 
levels to truly grasp family planning work. This problem must 
be handled seriously. Leaders must do a solid job of paying 
attention to the grass-roots levels, laying a good foundation, 
and constantly helping to enhance grass-roots units' capability 
to control population growth. It is necessary to strengthen the 
building of the family planning contingent at the grass-roots 
level and put effort into improving the quality of the cadres' 
contingent and closely linking propaganda and ideological work 
with management according to law. It is necessary to compile 
population statistics properly. Starting from this year, 
regional authorities will organize forces to examine and check 
population statistics. In places where population statistics 
are grossly inaccurate, the relevant leaders and the specific 
persons in charge will be held accountable in a serious manner. 
Under the new situation, we must persist in carrying out 
reform, explore the way forward, and work in a down-to-earth 
manner to raise our region's family planning work to a new level. 
  At the meeting, Secretary Zhao Fulin aired his views on 
grasping our region's family planning work properly this year. 
He stressed: Leaders at all levels must conscientiously study 
and resolutely implement the spirit of the central discussion on 
family planning work. They must make an overall analysis of the 
population situation and family grasp planning work in a strict 
and unshakable manner. At present, we must particularly grasp 
family planning work in rural areas. We must assign cadres 
responsible for family planning work and their remuneration, 
duties, and responsibilities must be clearly defined. Births 
not covered by the state plan, or additional births, must be 
resolutely banned. Additional births must be controlled within 
the range of less than 5 percent. In addition, we must attach 
importance to family planning work in areas inhabited by 
minority nationalities. 
  Zhao Fulin pointed out: Under the new situation of 
establishing our socialist market economic system, we must 
actively explore and expand new methods of family planning work. 
The foothold of family planning work must be shifted to the 
center of serving economic construction. In this regard, the 
Guilin area has accumulated some excellent experiences. Facts 
prove that the three-way combination in family planning work is 
beneficial to coordinate the development of the population, 
economy, and society. The whole region must sum up and 
popularize the advanced experiences of the Guilin area. As far 
as strengthening leadership is concerned, we must insist that 
those number one men in the party and government personally 
grasp family planning work and take full responsibility for it. 
They must put family planning high on their important work 
agenda and personally preside over party and government meetings 
to specially discuss family planning issues. They must listen 
to work reports regularly, investigate implementation of the 
population plan, and ensure that work is carried out in a 
planned way, arrangements are properly made, investigations are 
conducted, and plans are implemented. Prefectural, city, and 
county leaders must include a population plan in the local 
overall plans for economic and social development and see to it 
that the plan is implemented. Family planning work must be 
regarded as an important factor determining party and government 
cadres' achievements, awards and commendation, and promotion. 
In a word, as long as those number one men in the party and 
government truly attach importance to family planning work, and 
grasp it personally, family planning work can definitely be 
carried out well. 
  Lan Siqi, chairman of the regional family planning 
commission, briefed attendees on the family planning situation 
in our region last year and on work plans for this year. At the 
meeting, the Guilin, Yulin, and Nanning areas and Beihai City 
passed on their experiences in three-way combination, helping 
counties attain their targets, and carrying out family planning 
work well. 
  Party and government leaders from various prefectures, 
cities 
and counties, as well as relevant departments directly under the 
regional authorities also attended the meeting.

  [Text] In his office on the afternoon of 5 May, Ruan 
Chongwu, provincial party secretary and governor, listened to a 
report submitted by the provincial industrial department. He 
made detailed inquiries about enterprises' production and 
operation, technical transformation, reforms, and so on. He 
also issued instructions on accelerating the pace of industrial 
development. 
  Ruan Chongwu pointed out: At present, funding remains the 
primary problem facing industrial production. Since the 
beginning of this year, there has been a tight money supply for 
enterprises in general. In particular, they have faced 
difficulties in obtaining circulating funds. To solve the 
funding problem, the key lies in inviting foreign investments. 
Departments in charge of industry and enterprises must exert 
great efforts to make use of foreign capital. With regard to 
making use of foreign capital, we can invigorate our original 
capital through equity transactions. 
  Ruan Chongwu emphasized: Our province's industrial technical 
level is low, and our industrial scale is small. To develop our 
industry, we must carry out large projects, especially those 
projects that can make full use of our province's strong points 
in natural resources -- such as oil refining; the petrochemical 
industry; the building materials industry, which includes 
ceramics, glass, cement, and bricks; as well as tropical crops; 
and the aquatic products processing industry. These projects 
promise high hopes of success. As long as we succeed in 
carrying out these large projects, our industry can be pushed to 
new heights. As long as our products are marketable, we can 
promote these projects. In particular, there is a big market 
for natural drinks. On the one hand, we must develop new 
products on a large scale. On the other, we must improve 
packaging. The problem of funds arising in the new, large 
projects also can be solved by inviting foreign investment and 
by making use of foreign capital. 
  As for enterprise reform, Ruan Chongwu stressed: The pace of 
enterprise reform must be accelerated. In state-owned 
enterprises, it is necessary to actively promote reform in the 
corporation system, with the emphasis on the system of 
limited-liability shareholding companies. This is the key to 
transforming the operational mechanisms of enterprises and 
enhancing their vigor. While carrying out enterprise reform, we 
must thoroughly solve the problems of enterprises' leadership 
mechanisms, efficiency, and contributions to society. It is 
very important to choose managers and factory directors well. 
Government departments must standardize their conduct and 
refrain from exercising excessive control over enterprises or 
interfering too much in own their affairs. The Industrial 
Department and a sugar plant held a meeting to discuss the way 
to separate the surplus labor force from the plant. It was good 
and necessary to do so. 
  In conclusion, Ruan Chongwu emphasized: Without exception, 
enterprises in Hainan -- whether they are covered by the 
provincial budget or belong to any ownership system -- are 
treated equally. The provincial industrial department is the 
unit responsible for all industries in the province. It must 
serve all industrial enterprises so as to jointly promote the 
great development of Hainan's industry.

  [Text] Yesterday, Governor Jia Zhijie; Hui Liangyu, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee; and Vice Governor 
Meng Qingping; led those in charge of departments under the 
direct jurisdiction of the provincial government to the city of 
Huangshi to conduct investigation and study and to handle 
official business on the spot. They held discussions with 
directors and managers of large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises to probe plans to deepen reform, accelerate 
development, and maintain stability, and helped enterprises 
solve practical problems. 
  During the investigation tour, Jia Zhijie and others 
listened 
to the report submitted by the person in charge of Huangshi, and 
fully affirmed the work of the Huangshi City CPC Committee and 
government. When talking about the problems currently facing the 
city -- such as funding strains, the increasing amount of losses 
suffered by enterprises, and some employees being badly off -- 
Jia Zhijie said: The difficulties currently facing our work are 
rather many. They are difficulties cropping up in the course of 
reform and development. We now are discussing ways of properly 
handling the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability. He stressed that all departments should pay close 
attention to and guarantee stability from top to bottom, and 
should ensure a stable political and social environment in which 
we can carry out reform and accelerate development. As for the 
problems in economic life, such funding strains, they should be 
resolved by adopting reform measures, and the supply of money of 
some selected localities, trades, and professions should be 
ensured. He hoped that Huangshi would speed up development, 
make the best possible use of its favorable conditions and avoid 
the unfavorable, bring its strong points into full play, and 
push ahead as a whole to strive for comprehensive development, 
with the large bringing along with the small and the cities 
pushing the countryside forward. Particular efforts should be 
made to accelerate the development of individual and private 
economies and of town and township enterprises so that Huangshi, 
an old industrial base, will radiate the vigor of its youth.

  [Text] Wuhan, may 12 (XINHUA) -- Residents along large 
reservoirs in central China's Hubei Province have become 
prosperous as local governments have adopted preferential 
policies to encourage them to develop a commodity economy. 
  Statistics show that the 45 large reservoir areas directly 
administered by the provincial government generated 530 million 
yuan in industrial and agricultural output value last year, 
compared with 360 million yuan in 1990. 
  The per capita net income of local residents also increased 
drastically. Most of the farmers living in the reservoir areas 
have now gotten enough to eat and wear. 
  While earmarking more money to support construction of basic 
facilities, such as farmland and water-control works to improve 
production and living conditions for local farmers, the 
provincial government has also adopted measures to encourage 
farmers in the above-mentioned areas to turn rich resources into 
economic advantages. 
  Local farmers have now established many cash forest areas, 
fish ponds, fenced streams for breeding fish, and bases for 
growing edible fungus, while making active efforts to set up 
numerous industrial businesses compatible with these bases. 
  Such efforts have begun to pay off. With more money in hand, 
farmers in the reservoir areas in turn have started to pursue 
more and better cultural activities.

  [Text] According to the Shaoyang radio station, in our 
province's Shaodong County there have been close to 100,000 
peasants from outside our province setting up factories and 
doing business. The county -- dubbed a land of opportunity, 
where all trades and professions prosper -- already has 90,000 
individual industrial and commercial businesses and private 
enterprises, as well as a floating population of more than 
100,000 people doing business there everyday. In 1993, total 
income of individual and private enterprises amounted to 1.5 
billion or so, constituting 60 percent of the total income of 
the county's national economy, while the total volume of 
commodity retail sales accounted for 50 percent of the society's 
total volume of commodity retail sales, thus forming a regional 
superiority for the development of the individual and private 
economies. Making use of this superiority, the Shaodong County 
CPC Committee and government have created a relaxed environment 
to attract peasants from the other parts of the country to 
settle down in the county. In addition, with a view to helping 
promote the development of productive forces, they have 
formulated numerous policies and measures to attract investment, 
and have successively invested over 30 million yuan to open 51 
market fairs throughout the county, thus forming a multifunction 
and multilayer market network with the Shaodong manufactured 
goods market, which has transactions amounting to 300 million 
yuan a year, as the dragon's head and 10 major specialized 
markets as the backbone elements. 
  After seeing that the environment was relaxed and the 
weather 
was delightful, the peasants who had come to Shaodong to do 
business settled down in the county to operate businesses, one 
after another, and some even moved their families there. The 
number of peasants from Zhejiang Province who settled down to do 
business in Shangdong's manufactured goods markets alone was 600 
households or more, and their business is growing more and more 
brisk.

  [Excerpt] The Autonomous Regional Foreign Propaganda 
Bureau held a farewell meeting for all members of the Chinese 
Tibet Art Troupe prior to their departure for a performing visit 
to Austria, at the Tibet Guesthouse in the afternoon of 11 May. 
Speaking at the function, Autonomous Regional Chairman 
Gyaincain Norbu said: After meticulous and thorough 
preparations, the Tibet Art Troupe will soon be leaving for 
performances in Austria. The troupe is thus far Tibet's largest 
cultural troupe to be dispatched for overseas performances, 
serving not only as a key foreign propaganda project for Tibet, 
but also a major cultural exchange program with foreign 
countries. Gyaincain Norbu stated: We should, through visiting 
performances, widely publicize Tibet's realities, including 
political stability, economic development, social progress, 
nationality solidarity, ever-enhancing living standards, 
protected Zang culture, and freedom of religion achieved under 
the correct central leadership and with the vigorous support of 
people of all nationalities across the country in the past 
40-odd years since its peaceful liberation, particularly since 
launching of reform and opening up, so that more Zang 
compatriots overseas and people all over the world will have a 
correct and full understanding on Tibet -- a bid to project a 
correct image of a new socialist Tibet to the world and to 
enhance friendship between the people of the Chinese Tibet and 
that of other nations through friendly exchanges. 
  Gyaincain Norbu said: The Tibet Art Troupe will not only 
function as Chinese ambassadors responsible for conducting 
cultural exchanges with foreign countries with the missions of 
spreading friendship and broadening overseas publicity, but will 
also be given the important responsibilities of studying, 
drawing experience from, and absorbing the fine cultures of the 
people of other nations. The autonomous regional party 
committee and government hope that all members of the art troupe 
will be united as one in completely fulfilling their glorious 
and arduous missions entrusted by the party and the people of 
the motherland. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The fifth meeting of the sixth Standing 
Committee of the autonomous regional committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] closed in the 
morning of 11 May. [passage omitted] 
  Addressing the meeting, Basang, deputy secretary of the 
autonomous regional party committee and vice chairman of the 
autonomous regional committee of the CPPCC, said: Since the 
first meeting of the Sixth Standing Committee of the Tibet 
Autonomous Regional Committee of the CPPCC, the committee, 
guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, has been conscientiously 
implementing guidelines set by 14th CPC National Congress, the 
third plenary session of the 14th Central Committee, and the 
fifth (enlarged) meeting of the fourth autonomous regional party 
committee; holding high the flags of patriotism and socialism; 
persisting in the principles of long-term coexistence, mutual 
supervision, and treating each other with all sincerity and 
sharing weal or woe; fully promoting socialist democracy; 
seriously exercising the functions of political consultations 
and democratic supervision amid economic construction; and 
making its due contributions toward the region's political 
stability, reform and opening up, economic development, and 
social progress. As this year will be an important year for 
China's on-going reform, opening up, and modernization drive, 
"seizing the opportunities, deepening reform, opening wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability" will be the 
overall strategies for the entire nation." Within the realm of 
these overall strategies, we in the CPPCC must first identify 
our position, select a favorable perspective, and bring out our 
superiority before we offer plans and ideas for stabilizing the 
situation and promoting reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. In line with the principle of macroeconomics, 
pioneering, in-depth, and practicality, we should actively 
participate in government and political affairs by putting 
forward plans and ideas, concentrating on major problems 
surfacing in carrying out the central tasks of the autonomous 
regional party committee and government, on difficult points in 
economic development, and on flash topics of common concern. In 
his speech, Comrade Basang put forward concrete demands on ways 
to better bring out the role of consultation and supervision 
under the CPPCC system and how special investigations, 
self-construction, and organizational services can be 
intensified.

  [Text] Pretoria, May 11 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC]'s ambassador to South Africa, Loh I-cheng, on Wednesday 
[11 May] denied reports that President Li Teng-hui had a dinner 
meeting with Zambia President Frederick Chiluba during which the 
two discussed establishing diplomatic relations. 
  Several Taipei newspapers carried reports Wednesday that 
Chiluba was the guest of honor at a dinner given by Li at Loh's 
residence Tuesday. Both President Li and Chiluba were among the 
heads of state attending the inauguration of new South African 
President Nelson Mandela. 
  Loh and Presidential Spokesman Raymond Tai, who is 
accompanying Li during his trip, said only embassy staff and 
President Li's entourage were present at the dinner. 
  But Loh said Li did have a meeting with ranking South 
African 
officials, including a provincial governor and a member of the 
new cabinet, at his residence Tuesday.

  [Text] In a sign of respect and hospitality for President 
Li's visit, Jose Maria Figueres, president-elect of Costa Rica, 
specially convened a joint news conference on the morning of 7 
May local time, at which the leaders of the two nations answered 
correspondents' questions. Because of the imminent changeover 
of government in Costa Rica, the conference hall was packed with 
correspondents from various countries who came to cover the 
inauguration. Asked about democracy in Costa Rica and what we 
can learn from Costa Rica's experience of democracy, President 
Li said: Costa Rica has been a model democracy of late, because 
all the institutions in Costa Rica are founded on the idea of 
power belonging to the people. Power is being transferred 
peacefully in Costa Rica from the outgoing president to the 
incoming president, and there is no uneasiness over the 
changeover of political power. 
  Aware of the presence of a XINHUA correspondent, President 
Li 
changed the subject by pointing out: The foremost problem on 
mainland China is who is going to be the successor. Looking at 
the democratic institutions in Costa Rica, we should know that 
lasting peace and stability must be founded on institutions. It 
would be ideal for politics to be founded on institutions. 
President Li said: 
  "The expression that power belongs to the people is an old 
saying; it is, as a matter of fact, also very timely. Let us 
talk about it. I believe a representative from mainland China 
is present here. The biggest problem facing mainland China is 
who is going to be the successor. [words indistinct] will tell 
you that the democracy we are promoting is such an institution. 
We should know that lasting peace and stability refers 
precisely to the establishment of such institutions. The 
establishment of institutions [words indistinct]. I believe 
that this is the best and soundest approach." 
  At this point, President Li said with emotion that he has a 
dream. His dream is avert transferring power only after his 
death. He would be happiest to oversee a peaceful transfer of 
power while he is still alive. 
  "I have a dream. I hope that some day I can hand over power 
to another person. I would be happiest doing that. There has 
never been a president in China, in the ROC, who has handed over 
power to another a person while he was still alive. In the 
dynasties of old, a new emperor would emerge only after the old 
one died. I hope this will not happen again. This is precisely 
the goal of our constitutional reform. Only then will the 
country enjoy stability. Development is possible only when there 
is stability." 
  [Words indistinct] his ideas of democracy and power 
belonging 
to the people and his wishes to establish a political system of 
lasting peace and stability, the XINHUA correspondent present at 
the news conference told ROC correspondents that what President 
Li said was very sensible. China indeed needs to become more 
democratic and scientific. The practice in the past of one 
person designating another as his successor should never be 
repeated. 
  (Shu Chih-cheng), director of the Secretariat of the 
Presidential Office who was a member of the government 
delegation, also told the XINHUA correspondent that the 
president's words were from the bottom of his heart, saying that 
he hoped that they would give full coverage to his remarks.

  [Text] Vienna, May 10 (CNA) -- Some 33.5 percent of all 
power in Taiwan is generated by nuclear power plants, making 
Taiwan the world's 12th largest user of nuclear power, according 
to a report compiled by the International Atomic Energy agency 
Tuesday [10 May]. 
  The ratio put Taiwan behind Switzerland's 37.9 percent, 
Bulgaria's 36.9 percent, and Spain's 36 percent, the report said. 
  Eight countries generate more than or nearly 50 percent of 
their power with nuclear plants, including Lithuania (87.2 
percent), France (77.7 percent), Belgium (58.9 percent), 
Slovakia (53.6 percent), Hungary and Slovenia (43.3 percent), 
Sweden (42 percent), and Korea (40.3 percent). 
  Meanwhile, the report said there are 18 countries in the 
world whose nuclear power usage ratios surpassed 25 percent in 
1993, including Taiwan, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, 
Japan, Britain, and Ukraine. 
  There are 430 operational nuclear power plants in the world 
and 55 plants are under construction, the report said. 
  In 1993, nine new nuclear power plants began operations in 
Canada, Mainland China, France, Japan, Russia, and the United 
States.

  [Text] Taipei, May 11 (CNA) -- Taiwan will cut import 
tariffs on more than half of its agricultural products in 
preparation for its entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT), the Council of Agriculture (COA) said 
Wednesday [11 May]. 
  Import tariffs on 660 out of 1,300 farm products are 
expected 
to be cut during the second half of this year, but not by a 
significant margin, a COA official said. 
  The average import tariff on agricultural products is 
expected to be cut to 20.5 percent from the current 21.6 percent 
before the end of this year, moving closer to targets set by a 
number of foreign nations, particularly the U.S., the official 
said. 
  A Taiwan mission, led by Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu 
Ke-sheng, has left for Washington for the second round of 
U.S.-Taiwan trade negotiations under the GATT framework. 
  The U.S. negotiators, who have asked Taiwan to cut import 
tariffs on agricultural products to under 20 percent, are 
expected to agree with Taiwan negotiators on a range between 13 
percent and 20 percent, a formula modeled after precedents set 
by South Korea and Japan, the official said. 
  The Taiwan negotiators will proceed to Geneva on May 16 to 
attend further tariff reduction talks with officials from five 
countries, including Canada. 
  Taiwan has held negotiations with more than 10 nations since 
March to discuss tariff and non-tariff trade issues related to 
Taiwan's GATT membership. Among the issues discussed, tariff 
cuts on agricultural products have been a major concern. 
  So far Taiwan has held tariff reduction talks with Hungary, 
South Africa, Brazil, New Zealand, Turkey, Australia, Chile, 
Egypt, Singapore and Switzerland with a view to accelerating 
Taiwan's entry into GATT. 
  The 12-member European Union is also scheduled to hold 
bilateral tariff reduction talks with Taiwan in May, and will 
most likely use the results of the second-round Taiwan-U.S. 
trade consultations as reference for its own negotiations with 
Taiwan. 
  Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September 
1992, is expected to become a full member by the end of this 
year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 11 (CNA) -- The domestic investment 
willingness of local small- and medium-sized business has 
rebounded, an indication that the overseas relocation fever 
among Taiwan industries has been easing, the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs reported Wednesday [11 May]. 
  Citing a recent survey on 1993-1994 investment willingness 
of 
local industries, Vice Minister S.J. Li said 64 percent of the 
manufacturers and companies surveyed -- up from last year's 57 
percent -- said they had plans to invest at home this year while 
those who said they did not dropped by 6.4 percent to 36 percent. 
  Those manufacturers and companies who are planning to invest 
at home will mainly boost purchases of machinery and expand 
facilities, Li said, adding that only 25 percent of the 
companies plan to pour more than NT$20 million (about 
US$800,000) into new investment projects this year, noticeably 
down from last year's 35.7 percent. Some 33 percent will invest 
from NT$1 million to NT$5 million, Li noted. 
  Meanwhile, Mainland China remains the favored site for 
Taiwan 
industries when choosing overseas production bases, with 64 
percent of the respondents saying they preferred the mainland to 
other countries because of the cheap cost of labor there. 
  The survey also found that most local manufacturers hope the 
government will allow more foreign workers into Taiwan and 
provide more land for industrial use as well as more financial 
assistance. They also want the government to step up efforts to 
shut down illegal factories and increase the pace of developing 
more small-scale industrial zones, according to the survey.

  [Text] Taipei, May 11 (CNA) -- Taiwan was rated the 
world's third best country for investment, next to Japan and 
Switzerland, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Wednesday [11 
May]. 
  Ministry officials said that the rating was listed in the 
latest report of the New York-based Business Environment Risk 
Intelligence S.A. (BERI), which regularly evaluates investment 
profit opportunities in the world's 50 major countries. 
  BERI issues the investment climate report three times a 
year, 
in March, July, and November, they said. 
  The March report said that Taiwan's ranking may advance to 
second place sometime within the next five years. This will put 
Taiwan on equal footing with Japan and Singapore, the report 
said. Switzerland is expected to keep hold of its top position, 
the report added. 
  The BERI evaluation on investment profit opportunities is 
based on three major indicators: the operation risk index, the 
political risk index, and repatriation capabilities. A final 
cumulative assessment comes out after separate evaluation of the 
three factors. 
  In terms of the operation risk index, which comprises 15 
items including inflation, the balance of international 
payments, transportation and telecommunications, and long-term 
loans and trust funds, Taiwan topped the economic growth list 
and and ranked second in the local attitude toward foreign 
investors and their profits as well as labor costs versus labor 
productivity. 
  Taiwan was placed fourth with Norway in the political risk 
index, behind Switzerland, Singapore, and Austria. 
  In repatriation capabilities, Taiwan was currently rated as 
third, behind Japan and Switzerland, but was expected to jump to 
the top position in the next five years. 
  The officials, commenting on the BERI report, pledged that 
they would continue their efforts to help improve Taiwan's 
investment environment.

  [Text] Taipei, May 11 (CNA) -- The Taiwan High Court on 
Wednesday [11 May] upheld the nine-year jail term meted out to 
Shih Yuebo by the Taipei District Court earlier this year for 
hijacking a passenger airliner from Mainland China to Taiwan on 
Aug. 10. 
  Shih pled not guilty, claiming he hijacked the plane to seek 
political asylum mere. 
  Shih, 30, of Hebei Province, forced the Air China Boeing 
767, 
which was en route from Beijing to Indonesia, to land in Taiwan 
after he threatened the crew with what he said was a bomb but 
that later turned out to be sulfuric acid in a bottle. 
  Nobody was injured during the incident, the third of 11 
hijackings of mainland Chinese planes to Taiwan last year.

<F P=106> [By Agatha Ngai at Qiandao Lake, Zhejiang Province] </F>
  [Text] Attempts by Beijing to heal the wounds of the 
Qiandao Lake tragedy have apparently backfired with relatives of 
the Taiwanese victims criticising the authorities for concealing 
and intentionally destroying evidence. 
  The relatives were yesterday shown the charred boat in which 
the 24 Taiwanese tourists and their eight mainland tour guides 
were burnt to death on March 31. 
  "The Chinese Government is not sincere in helping us," said 
one victim's relative Chen Chin-tzu. 
  Relatives' representative Wang Tse-lung said he had pictures 
of the boat which could prove that the pleasure boat had been 
further damaged since their last visit. "Last time (in April), 
there were only a few holes found on the boat's plastic shade... 
But it (the shade) is totally damaged now," Mr Wang claimed. 
"What are they (the mainland authorities) trying to hide from 
us?" he asked. 
  Another relative, Lin Chi-neng, said the top of the bow had 
been repainted. 
  In addition to the pleasure boat, the relatives and a 
delegation of experts of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation 
(SEF) were also taken to a display room where they were shown 
two hunting rifles used by the murderers. They also saw 33 
pictures developed from films taken by the Taiwanese victims 
before the murder, some cash, and six cameras belonging to the 
victims. 
  Despite this evidence the relatives claimed that the Chinese 
authorities had broken an earlier promise of giving them a 
forensic report -- more than a month after the autopsies were 
completed. "We have been here for four days. And today is the 
first time we have been given some practical information about 
the case. However, the scene (of the crime) has been damaged. 
The video they have shown us in the last two days is also 
incomplete. How can I know the truth and be satisfied?" Mr Wang 
said. 
  But Hangzhou's Public Security Bureau Criminal Investigation 
Team Commander Li Shuguang denied they had destroyed evidence of 
the massacre. "We have to sweep up the ashes to look for 
evidence. The point of the explosion was discovered after 
cleaning the cabin," Mr Li said. 
  Hsu Hui-you, secretary-General of the SEF said the visit 
yesterday was "helpful." "We hope we can come to a conclusion 
when we go back to Hangzhou," Mr Hsu said. "What we are doing 
is to manage the aftermath of the incident objectively and 
reasonably. We hope crosss-trait relations will return to 
normal quickly."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Li Chi-kuang (2621 1323 0342)] </F>
  [Text] On the morning of 20 April Yin Tsung-wen, director 
of the National Security Bureau, gave a report to the National 
Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan saying more than 3,000 
mainland stowaways have gone into hiding in Taiwan. The 
National Police Administration will handle these cases by 
relying on letters of accusation and reports made by people, and 
by offering rewards to informants; the Investigation Bureau will 
be in charge of investigating the illegal entry of groups of 
people from the mainland. 
  Yin Tsung-wen stated: From 1987 to March of this year, 
public security and intelligence agencies discovered a total of 
more than 28,300 mainlanders who entered Taiwan illegally, of 
which 26,324 have been repatriated back to the mainland. About 
60 percent of those were discovered inside Taiwan, and 40 
percent were caught at sea or when they tried to make shore. 
This shows the massive efforts taken by the National Security 
Bureau are quite effective.

were living in Taiwan at the end of March, including some 21,012 
who were staying in Taiwan illegally, according to the Interior

Justice Investigation Bureau estimated that there were 180,000 
legal and illegal foreigners in Taiwan. 
  The Interior Ministry said it has approved work permits for 
169,417 foreign workers, of which 83,701 had already come here

  [Text] Taipei, May 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan is seeking to boost 
trade with Southeast Asian nations by signing double taxation 
avoidance agreements with countries in the region, the Board of 
Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Thursday [12 May]. 
  BOFT officials said the board has held consultations on how 
to avoid double taxation with Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia and 
Thailand. Although differences remain, the officials expressed 
hope that agreement could be signed soon. 
  Meanwhile, Taiwan is also expected to ask the nations to 
sign 
more far-reaching taxation agreements in the future. 
  The Finance Ministry has already evaluated the impact on 
Taiwan's tax revenue and trade relations if the expanded 
agreements are signed. The ministry has also mapped out a 
taxation agreement draft to help speed up consultations on the 
issue.

<F P=106> [Text of comments by unidentified spokesman of the Foreign </F>
Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress on 22 April 
regarding a report on Sino-British relations issued by the 
Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons] 
  [Text] Since last year, the Foreign Affairs Committee of 
the British House of Commons has held several hearings on the 
China question. On April 13, the committee issued a report 
related to the relations between Britain and China before and 
after 1997. The report openly advocates the adoption of a 
further confrontation policy toward China and interfering in 
China's internal affairs. We express strong indignation and 
regret over this. 
  The report admits the British side's change of policy 
regarding Hong Kong and its support of Governor Chris Patten's 
practices in Hong Kong, proceeding from its inaccurate 
assessment of the current situation and prospects in China. 
While continuing to adopt a policy of confrontation with China, 
the report even advocates seeking international support over the 
Hong Kong issue. We are shocked by such a report at a time when 
the British side has repeatedly stated that it would cooperate 
with China on other issues now that the truth of the disputes 
over Hong Kong's political system has been made clear to the 
public. 
  The report claims that China will not change the three-level 
political framework established by the Hong Kong governor in 
violation of the Sino-British Declaration, the Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the bilateral 
understandings already reached by the two sides. The Chinese 
government has repeatedly stated that, in order to guard the 
sanctity of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and 
the Basic Law, the Hong Kong Legislative Council and district 
organizations established according to Patten's program can only 
exist till June 30, 1997. After that date the government, the 
legislative council and district organizations of Hong Kong will 
be reorganized in accordance with the Basic Law. We firmly 
support the stand of the Chinese government. 
  The report even openly attacks some articles, such as 
Articles 18 and 158, in the Basic Law which state that the 
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) 
has the right to announce a state of emergency in Hong Kong when 
necessary and that the right to explain the Basic Law lies with 
the NPC Standing Committee. These provisions are to ensure the 
restoration of China's exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong 
after July 1, 1997. However, the report claims the articles are 
a potential serious threat to the Special Administrative Region 
of Hong Kong, thus revealing the true motive of the British side 
to attempt to prolong its control and influence over Hong Kong. 
  The promotion of democracy and the safeguarding of human 
rights in Hong Kong as advocated in the report has revealed the 
hypocrisy of the British side. The essence of the disputes over 
Hong Kong's political system is not whether or not to develop 
democracy, but whether or not to abide by international 
commitments and to ensure the smooth transition of Hong Kong in 
line with the Basic Law. The Chinese government put forward the 
policy of "one country, two systems" and advocated the 
exercising of a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong. The Basic 
Law has provided adequate and specific provisions on the 
development of democracy in Hong Kong after the Special 
Administrative Region is established. There have been no 
democracy or human rights to speak of over the past century or 
more while the British codes for colonies governed Hong Kong. 
To make much fanfare about democracy and human rights just a 
few years before the ending of its rule over Hong Kong is aimed 
at simply creating confusion. 
  The report also suggests that a human rights committee and 
human rights supervision agency be established in Hong Kong. 
The purpose is to create new barriers for the smooth transition 
of power in Hong Kong. The Chinese side will not recognize 
British unilateral decisions made on major affairs that extend 
beyond 1997. 
  The report, in an attempt to interfere in China's internal 
affairs, advocates self-determination of Tibet. It is known to 
all that since ancient times, Tibet has been an inalienable part 
of Chinese territory. Before 1959, a system of feudal serfdom 
was practiced in Tibet, which was darker and crueler than that 
of the Middle Ages in Europe. The old Tibet was one of the 
regions in the world which suffered most seriously from 
violations of human rights. 
  After abolishing the serf system, Tibet began to march down 
the road of national unity and economic development, and people 
began living in peace and contentment. This is a reform of 
historical significance that moves to safeguard human rights and 
promote social progress. 
  But the authors of the report do not like to see this kind 
of 
change. On the contrary, they describe the serf owners as 
"guards of human rights," a statement which in itself pokes 
great fun at human rights. The making of such claims is in fact 
an attempt to sabotage China's unification and national unity. 
  We advise them to take a cautious attitude toward the issue 
of Tibet in light of what part Britain has played in history. 
The Chinese government and its people, including compatriots of 
the Tibetan nationality, are firmly opposed to any attempts to 
use the so-called Tibet issue to interfere in China's internal 
affairs. These attempts will never be realized. 
  The British House of Commons also suggests strengthening the 
ties between the British parliament and Taiwan's "legislative 
yuan," calling on the British government to ease its 
restrictions on Taiwan. There is only one China in the world, 
and Taiwan is part of its territory. The government of the 
People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government 
representing China, a fact recognized by the world community. 
The point of view on the issue of Taiwan by the Foreign Affairs 
Committee of the British House of Commons runs counter to the 
principles concerning the establishment of diplomatic ties 
between China and Britain. Its real aim is to create "two 
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," a move firmly opposed by the 
entire Chinese populace, including the people of Taiwan. 
  The report also has an ulterior motive in advocating the 
"China threat," which is simply slated to undermine the 
relations between China and,its neighboring countries. It is 
known to all that China pursues an independent foreign policy of 
peace and is a positive agent for safeguarding world peace and 
stability. So talk of a "China threat" is totally groundless 
and to no avail. 
  The NPC Foreign Affairs Committee attaches great importance 
to maintaining and developing its friendly ties and cooperation 
with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of 
Commons. 
  The Chinese side does not do anything to harm Britain, the 
British parliament or Sino-British ties. But some members of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons 
have recently repeatedly harmed Sino-British relations while 
stressing the maintenance and development of Sino-British 
relations. We should ask their motives and where they will lead 
to in terms of bilateral relations. It is certain that the 
anti-Chinese views that the report has raised will bring harm 
not only to Sino-British relations, but also to the long-term 
interests of Britain. We believe that those who really care for 
and want to safeguard traditional and friendly bilateral 
relations do not want to see that happen.

<F P=106> [By Linda Choy, Louis Won, So Lai-Fun, Fung Wai-Kong, Doreen </F>
Cheung, and Mark Hughes] 
  [Text] Government officials yesterday abstained from an 
appeal for the Chinese authorities to respect the freedom of the 
press in Hong Kong and release jailed journalist Xi Yang. This 
was despite pledges that it would continue to pursue the case. 
  After a heated debate the three ex-officio members joined 
the 
Liberal Party and independents Martin Barrow, Elsie Tu, and 
Roger Luk Koon-hoo, in abstaining from the vote. 
  The Secretary for Home Affairs, Michael Suen Ming-yeung, 
said 
in the official reply that the government shared the concerns of 
legislators who supported the motion. The government had tried 
to seek more authoritative information about Xi, the Ming Pao 
reporter jailed for 12 years by Beijing for allegedly stealing 
state secrets, through the British Embassy. 
  Citing the lack of guidelines for Hong Kong reporters 
regarding the definition of state secrets, Mr Suen said: "The 
Hong Kong Government fully appreciates the depth of this anxiety 
and has forcefully conveyed it to the UK Government. As a 
result, clarification of the law on state secrets and the 
promulgation of clear rules and guidelines on news gathering has 
been a key request made by the British Government in its 
exchanges with China on Mr Xi's case." 
  The motion, proposed by the United Democrats' Yeung Sum, was 
endorsed by a majority of 24 to one. It was backed by Meeting 
Point, the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood's 
Frederick Fung Kin-kee, as well as the Hong Kong Democratic 
Foundation's Jimmy McGregor together with some other 
independents. 
  Pro-China legislator Chim Pui-chung voted against the 
motion, 
following a heated exchange with United Democrat Szeto Wah. 
  Tabling the motion, Mr Yeung said the sentence handed down 
to 
Xi was a signal for Hong Kong reporters to practise 
self-censorship. Rejecting the accusations made by the Chinese 
Government against Xi, Mr Yeung said the heavy sentence was 
based on "unfounded `facts', unclear evidence, and inappropriate 
application of judicial process and laws." He criticised the 
secretive manner in which the trial was conducted, saying this 
had undermined Hong Kong people's confidence towards what China 
called "an independent decision made by the judiciary." He also 
accused the Chinese authorities of lying when they said the Xi 
case had nothing to do with press freedom in Hong Kong. He 
cited as proof the fact that China had retaliated against 
reporters who had signed a petition in support of Xi. The 
reporters had been barred from covering a visit to the mainland 
by relatives of the Taiwanese victims of the Qiandao Lake 
killings. 
  Mr Yeung's call was echoed by United Democrat chairman 
Martin 
Lee Chu-ming, who urged the Governor, Chris Patten, to "practise 
what he preached" and take positive steps to protect press 
freedom. Mr Lee said the lack of initiative from Mr Patten 
would leave Hong Kong vulnerable to intimidation by China after 
1997. 
  However, the United Democrats' view was rejected by Mr Chim, 
who accused them of a lack of understanding of the case. Mr 
Chim questioned how much the party knew of Xi's background. "We 
must get an in-depth understanding of the issue before making 
criticisms, or else we will be misleading the public," he said.

<F P=106> [By Ivan Tong and Chan Wai-Fong] </F>
  [Text] China has tightened controls on Hong Kong reporters 
by barring them from an international securities symposium in 
Beijing. 
  About 12 Hong Kong business journalists, invited to Beijing 
to attend the symposium last week, were prevented from covering 
the event after a warning from the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office. 
  It was the second time in a week that Beijing had cracked 
down on Hong Kong journalists covering events on the mainland. 
  According to Richard Tsang, director of Edelman Financial 
who 
invited Hong Kong journalists to the symposium, the organisers 
were told by the office that some of the journalists invited had 
no permits and could not cover the event. "This is a sensitive 
time, and we don't want anything to happen," Mr Tsang said. 
  On Thursday, Beijing banned at least seven Hong Kong 
journalists seeking to cover a visit by a Taiwan delegation to 
the site of the Qiandao Lake tourist boat fire. The journalists 
had signed a petition expressing their concern and anger over 
Ming Pao journalist Xi Yang's 12-year sentence for "stealing 
state secrets" and were boycotted "propaganda-oriented" media 
invitations from China until the end of this month. Hong Kong 
Journalists' Association chairman Daisy Li Yuet-wah said 
Beijing's move was apparently a reaction to the journalists' 
boycott. 
  "There is no sign that it is a long-term policy to tighten 
control. And we do not want this to happen again," she said. 
  The Hong Kong journalists were angered by a statement from 
the organisers that "foreign journalists have not been formally 
invited to report" on the symposium. "The event's PR consultant 
issued invitations to the local press in black and white. I 
simply don't understand why they denied having made any 
invitation," Ms Li said. 
  Mr Tsang said journalists were invited to attend the 
symposium, but "they have been told that no reporting activities 
should be done when the symposium is on". "We won't interfere 
during recesses," he said.

<F P=106> [By Rain Ren] </F>
  [Text] Hopes for an agreement over military lands have 
evaporated following a dramatic new set of demands by the 
Chinese, it was revealed yesterday. Officials close to the 
negotiations said the British were "shocked" when told that the 
promised new naval base for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) 
on Stonecutters Island was "too small." 
  The Chinese have also reneged on a promise to allow some 
residential property occupied by the British military to be 
redeveloped. The PLA now wants to use the property to house its 
own soldiers. 
  Chinese negotiators were also reluctant to agree on specific 
wording that any unused sites after the 1997 handover must be 
given to the special administrative region government. The PLA, 
a powerful behind-the-scenes influence during the seven-year 
talks, is thought to be responsible for the new demands. 
  These unexpected setbacks emerged after the second day of 
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) talks in Hong Kong yesterday. A 
source said that the British side had thought that everything 
was in place and a final agreement had been expected tomorrow. 
Officials said it was unlikely that Britain could meet China's 
new demands. 
  The government's original idea was to pay for the PLA naval 
base on Stonecutters Island with the profits received from the 
sale of the military flats. If those flats had to be released 
to the PLA, officials said, the Government would have to draw 
from its reserve funds to build the new naval base. It would be 
hard to win Legislative Council approval for this. 
  It is believed that during the last JLG defence land expert 
meeting the two sides agreed the size of the new naval base 
would be about 160,000 square metres. It was estimated the 
government would have to pay more than $1bn for its construction. 
  China's new demands mean that seven years of talks have 
failed to reach agreement about the disposal of military lands. 
This will create a bad atmosphere at the JLG general session 
scheduled for May 31. 
  During the two-day meeting, according to sources, British 
negotiators tried deseparately to remind their Chinese 
colleagues of all those matters that Britain assumed had been 
agreed by China before the meeting. China had reportedly agreed 
to release about 25 sites to the government for redevelopment, 
including Royden Court in Repulse Bay, Mt Austin Mansion at the 
Peak, Cape Mansion, Harcourt Place in Happy Valley, Tudor Court 
in Kowloon, and Burma Lines in Fanling. Of 11 main military 
sites, the PLA was expected to get about eight, including the 
Prince of Wales building in Central, the naval base on 
Stonecutters Island, the Gun Club Hill site in Kowloon, which 
will be used to build a military hospital for the PLA, Stanley 
Fort, and the barracks in Osborn [Kowloon Tong] and Sek Kong. 
  The Chinese JLG officials will be shown some sites today, 
after which the talks will continue.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "China's Military Representatives </F>
Secretly Visit Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] The Defense and Security Expert Group of the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group is discussing the use of 
military sites. An informed source has disclosed that if an 
agreement can be reached on Friday, the Sino-British Airport 
Authority is likely to resume its meeting on 17 May, a date 
proposed by the British side, to resolve the pending new airport 
financial arrangements. 
  At the ongoing meeting of the expert group, Chinese and 
British representatives are holding discussions and hoping to 
reach an agreement. As the main issues have been straightened 
out, both sides are discussing the wording of the agreement. 
  Since early April this year, several groups of important 
mainland People's Liberation Army [PLA] officials, including 
representatives from the General Staff Department, the Navy, and 
the 42d Group Army of the ground forces, have visited Hong Kong 
to secretly inspect British military sites and gather 
information first hand. 
  In late April, the CPC Central Military Commission held a 
meeting to discuss stationing troops in the territory, to listen 
to a report by an inspecting team from Hong Kong, and to ratify 
the use of military sites. 
  The British side also received hints from the Chinese side 
that it would be more flexible on the question of military sites 
to resolve the resumption of the Airport Authority talks and the 
fourth financial arrangements. 
  At the current meeting, both sides have narrowed their 
differences mainly because the Chinese side has agreed to accept 
14 major military sites for PLA use. In addition, another 25 
military sites will be delivered to the special administrative 
region [SAR] government for development. The earnings are 
estimated to be HK$100 billion. Thus, the SAR Government will 
have tangible financial reserves. The British side has promised 
to repair and improve military facilities for use by the PLA. 
  Prior to this, the Chinese side had already indicated to the 
British side that if the military sites issue could be smoothly 
resolved, the Airport Authority could set the date for a 
meeting. If such is the case, at a formal panel of the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group at the end of this month both 
sides can finalize the decisions of the Airport Authority and 
the expert group concerning the new airport issue and military 
sites. 
  The Chinese side wishes to resolve the military sites issue 
as soon as possible, mainly because of heavy pressure from the 
mainland military. With proper consolation provided for the 
mainland military, the Chinese side will be able to take care of 
pressure from the outside and resolve the new airport issue. 
  Because the new airport project has entered an important 
stage, some franchised contracts have to be ratified. If China 
and Britain cannot reach an agreement on the new airport 
financial arrangements this will produce a major impact on the 
new airport project. 
  It is learned that the Chinese side intends to discuss and 
resolve the financial arrangements together with the draft 
regulations for the new airport corporation, showing flexibility 
on the former for the purpose of the British side's concessions 
on the latter.

Ziying Says People Should Rest Assured of the Prospects of 
Religions in Hong Kong After 1997"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chen 
Ziying, deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, met today with a visiting delegation from 
the Hong Kong Buddhist Association, headed by Rev Kok-kwong, and 
expressed deep appreciation for the Hong Kong Buddhist 
Association's benevolent activities over the past 50 years since 
its founding. He asked the Buddhists in Hong Kong to rest 
assured of the prospects for religions in Hong Kong after 1997. 
  Chen Ziying said that, according to the Basic Law, the 
future 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government will 
not impose any restriction on religious freedom. People with 
religious beliefs, including Buddhists, will be able to openly 
carry out missionary work and hold various religious activities 
that are not in violation of SAR laws. 
  Temples, hospitals, and other rights and properties of 
religious organizations will not be affected, and will be 
protected by law. 
  In addition, religious organizations and individuals in Hong 
Kong may continue to maintain and develop relations with their 
counterpart organizations and individuals in other areas. 
  Chen Ziying said that between the Hong Kong and mainland 
Buddhist organizations, Buddhists should show mutual respect 
before the Buddha, and there will be no subordinative 
relationship between the two sides. The religious circles in 
Hong Kong and the mainland are welcome to visit each other 
frequently so that they can increase exchanges. 
  Zhao Bingxin, director of the Hong Kong Social and Cultural 
Affairs Department of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, 
was present at the meeting. 
  In the evening, Chen Ziying and Zhao Bingxin invited the 
12-member delegation headed by Rev Kok-kwong to the Hong 
Kong-Macao Center.

  [Text] The head of the civil service, Anson Chan Pang 
On-sang, yesterday warned any attempts to destabilise the system 
would be resisted. She also rejected a proposal for civil 
servants to indicate before 1997 if they would be willing to 
serve the Special Administrative Region government. 
  Mrs Chan, the Chief Secretary, said arrangements for the 
continuity of the civil service had been set out in the Joint 
Declaration and the Basic Law. 
  "Indeed senior Chinese officials, including the Director of 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, have already repeatedly 
assured Hong Kong civil servants on this point," she said. "The 
continuity of service provisions are very clear and we do not 
believe that any further action is required." 
  The political sub-group of the Preliminary Working Committee 
recently proposed that civil servants should indicate their 
post-1997 plans. The proposal was criticised as a form of 
political vetting. 
  Mrs Chan said civil servants did not have a political role 
and their duty to serve the community should not alter before or 
after 1997. The civil service would not pursue private agendas 
or promote the policies of individuals, she said. 
  Despite China's refusal to discuss the line-up of senior 
civil servants, Mrs Chan said the Government believed a dialogue 
should begin as soon as possible. Only 22 positions would be 
affected by requirements, regarding the nationality of civil 
servants, in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, she said. 
  In the meantime, the Government would continue to fill the 
most senior government posts with local officers while adopting 
measures to restore the confidence of civil servants.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- Tian Qiyu, vice minister 
of public security, met with Li Junxia, head of the Hong Kong 
branch of the International Criminal Police Organization [ICPO] 
and commissioner of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force, and his 
party in Beijing the other day. At the invitation of Zhu Entao, 
director of the ICPO National Control Bureau of China, Li Junxia 
and his party arrived in Beijing on 9 April for the 19th working 
meeting between the ICPO National Control Bureau of China and 
the ICPO Hong Kong branch. 
  Zhu Entao held working-level talks with Li Junxia during the 
latter's stay in Beijing. The two sides briefed each other on 
public security in the hinterland and in Hong Kong and exchanged 
views on further cracking down on across-the-border crimes and 
conducting exchanges in work. Tian Qiyu, vice minister of 
public security, met with Li Junxia and his party. 
  During the meeting, Vice Minister Tian Qiyu extended a 
welcome to Li Junxia and his party. He also expressed 
appreciation for the Hong Kong police's efforts to maintain 
public order in the region and highly appraised police 
cooperation between the interior of the country and Hong Kong. 
  Tian Qiyu said: Since Mr. Li Junxia took over the office of 
Hong Kong Police Force commissioner, marked achievements have 
been scored by the interior of the country and Hong Kong in 
strengthening their cooperation and making concerted efforts to 
crack down on criminal offenses through the ICPO channel. Hong 
Kong's criminal offenses have continuously dropped since 1992, 
and its public order as a whole has taken a noticeable turn for 
the better. Mr. Li Junxia and the Hong Kong Police Force have 
contributed to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. 
  Tian Qiyu said: The year 1997 is drawing near. The Chinese 
Government is fully confident of the smooth handing-over of Hong 
Kong sovereignty in 1997. It is hoped that, in the last 
transitional period, the Hong Kong Police Force will play its 
due role in effecting a smooth transition. When the 
sovereignity of Hong Kong is returned to China in 1997, the 
Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will 
be responsible for its public order and organize its police 
force. Hong Kong police who love the motherland and Hong Kong 
are welcome to continue their service in the force in order to 
contribute their intelligence and wisdom to the region's 
prosperity and stability. Hong Kong police personnel are also 
welcome to visit and tour the interior of the country more often 
to enhance their understanding of the hinterland and to 
strengthen their cooperation with us so that we all can make a 
due contribution to cracking down on criminal offenses and 
maintaining social prosperity and stability.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yang Liu (2799 2692): "Guangzhou City </F>
Awards German Consortium $150 Million Contract for Subway Cars"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu said that a few days ago, 
Guangzhou awarded an important contract for subway locomotives 
and cars to a German consortium, and because the British 
authorities have adopted an unfriendly policy of confrontation 
toward China on the issue of Hong Kong, Guangzhou will not award 
any subway equipment contracts to British companies. 
  Li said at a public occasion in Hong Kong yesterday that the 
Guangzhou subway invited tenders for the import of 15 items. 
Several dozen foreign companies, including British companies, 
have participated in the bidding so far. However, he said that 
they did not plan to award contracts to British companies. 
  He said that locomotives and car imports were the most 
important. They had decided to award the $150 million contract 
to a German consortium led by Siemens Ltd. According to the 
contract, the German side will provide the Chinese side with 200 
German-made subway cars and locomotives in the next few years, 
when the Guangzhou subway is open to traffic. 
  He said that in addition to the Guangzhou Mass Transit 
Railway Corporation awarding contracts for the importation of 
two items last month, it awarded another supply contract a few 
days ago. At the end of last month, the company awarded 
contracts for the supply of an automatic ticket sales and 
checking system and an escalator system to two suppliers from 
the United States and Japan respectively. Li also talked about 
the development of construction of the 18.15-km Guangzhou 
subway, and he said that everything had progressed smoothly and 
that the whole line would be completed in 1998. The section 
between Fangcun and Huangsha will be open to traffic in 1997. 
  On the question of assigning the right to develop property 
above the 16 subway stations, Li said that of the right to 
develop 25 lots above the stations, 15 have been approved. 
Guangzhou is not anxious to award contracts to develop the 
remaining 10 lots. It will offer contracts when land prices 
have risen one or two years from now. 
  Yesterday, Li also touched on the questions of keeping down 
inflation and stabilizing rice prices and vegetable supplies in 
Guangzhou. He said that the city's price index (inflation) 
dropped from 23 percent in March to 21 percent in February, but 
we still should not lower our guard. He said that both now and 
in the future, Guangzhou, with a population of 7.2 million 
including the suburban areas, will never adopt the previous 
practice of issuing rice and oil coupons to residents. The city 
currently has grain reserves for six months' of consumption and 
puts over 90,000 tonnes of vegetables into the market every day.

  [Text] Beijing, May 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren met here today with Philip Leigh Tose, chairman of 
the Hong Kong Peregrine Investments Holdings Limited. 
  Rong said that expansion of China's opening up is an 
important aspect of its economic development, in the process of 
which China needs to attract foreign investments as well as 
upgrade its technology and reform old enterprises, through 
introduction of international advanced science and technology 
and management. 
  He expressed hope that Peregrine would play its role in 
China's economic construction and forge closer ties with Chinese 
enterprises both in the mainland and in Hong Kong. 
  Tose, who is leading a party here to attend the 1994 China 
summit meeting scheduled to open tomorrow, said that the future 
of his firm is closely related to the future of China. 
  "China will play a bigger role in the world in the next 
century," he noted. "We are full of confidence in the future of 
Hong Kong."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Cutting Off Oxygen"] </F>
  [Text] Information is the oxygen of financial markets. 
Reduce the flow, and they slow down. Cut it off, and they die. 
This is a truism with which those who govern China's still 
young markets were becoming very familiar. 
  But there is a now real concern that press activity in China 
is becoming much more regulated since the Xi Yang imprisonment, 
and the outspoken reaction which followed in Hong Kong. Threats 
of boycotts have been responded to with threats of exclusion. 
In this sort of game there are no winners. If it escalates, 
one of the losers will be the ambition of China to see its big 
companies comfortably listed and traded on foreign stock markets. 
  So it was an ominous development when journalists from Hong 
Kong attending a Beijing conference on the coming international 
listing of 22 mainland enterprises, organised by the China 
Securities Regulatory Commission, found themselves under 
apparent threat. 
  The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office told the organisers 
that those reporters who were not fully accredited through 
Xinhua (the New China News Agency) might be regarded as 
unwelcome guests, even though they had been formally invited by 
the organisers. Given the current atmosphere, prudent 
newspapers recalled their reporters. 
  The Hong Kong journalists' anger was legitimate when the 
organisers said foreign journalists had not been formally 
invited to report on the symposium. It was the second time in a 
week that Beijing had played it tough with journalists covering 
events on the mainland. 
  The result was that valuable information and interpretation 
of the programme for floating these companies was lost to the 
international investment field. Beijing has hurt, rather than 
helped, these firms by excluding the Hong Kong media from 
covering the event. 
  Instead of making journalists nervous about covering the 
plans for the corporatisation of China, the authorities should 
be looking at the role that the press plays in financial 
markets. There is an enormous demand from investors, both 
professional and private, for information about markets and 
companies. This is especially true of emerging markets, which 
are far from transparent. 
  Official statements, and even brokers' circulars, are only 
part of the information dissemination system. The press plays 
the bigger role of offering impartial reporting and analysis, 
which for many potential investors is the preferred source of 
information. 
  This is recognised by many mainland companies (and many 
government officials) who welcome journalists to their plants 
and offices to explain their businesses and outline their plans. 
  The regular conferences and symposiums held inside China are 
valuable sources of quality information about corporate 
developments. If China were to silence this essential dialogue 
it would quickly be noticed by the international investment 
community. No newspaper would be so arrogant as to claim that 
this would lead to a total investment drought, but it would 
undoubtedly add an item to the minus column of investors 
calculating their portfolio strategies. 
  It is in China's interest for Beijing to loosen the Hong 
Kong 
media's activities in the mainland -- not tighten them.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 KYODO -- China denounced on 
Thursday [12 May] a joint U.S.-Japanese-Vietnamese project to 
develop oil deposits under the ocean floor in the South China 
Sea off Vietnam. 
  Japan Petroleum Exploration Corp., Indonesia Petroleum Ltd. 
and Nissho Iwai Corp. of Japan and Mobil Corp. of the United 
States last month signed a contract on the project with the 
Vietnamese state-run oil corporation. 
  A Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman said the project for 
development of oil deposits in waters 400 kilometers off Vietnam 
infringed Chinese rights and interests and was illegal. 
  It said the area is part of waters around the 
Chinese-claimed 
Spratly Islands. 
  The islands are objects of territorial disputes involving 
China, Vietnam and other Asian nations.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 May (XINHUA) -- China and the United 
States will jointly establish a world first-class ammino fiber 
[an lun 8637 4858] producing enterprise in Shanghai. A signing 
ceremony was held at the Diaoyutai Guesthouse in Beijing this 
evening. Authoritative sources in this field said the move will 
upgrade China's synthetic fiber production to a new level. 
  The project, with an investment of $90 million, is a joint 
venture between the China Huayuan Industrial Company Limited 
under the China Textile Federation and the Dupont Corporation of 
the United States. It will be built within the China Textile 
Science and Technology Industrial City in Shanghai's Qingpu. 
The U.S. side has a 90 percent share in the project. After 
completion, it will be able to produce 2,000 tonnes of ammino 
fiber a year. 
  Ammino fiber has a good spinning and weaving property. A new 
high-tech product, it was invented by the Dupont Corporation of 
the United States. At present, only 23 enterprises in 15 
countries in the world can manufacture this type of new fiber. 
Their combined annual output is 50,000 tonnes. China currently 
produces only 700 tonnes a year. 
  State Councillor Song Jian and Chairman of the China Textile 
Federation Wu Wenying attended the signing ceremony.

<F P=106> [By Chang Hong: "Qian Seeks Immediate Cease-Fire in Yemen"] </F>
  [Text] Vice-premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen 
yesterday called for an immediate cease-fire and peaceful 
settlement to the civil strife in Yemen. "China is seriously 
concerned with the worsening situation in Yemen and deeply 
grieved by the huge loss in lives and property there," he said. 
"We sincerely hope that both the South and the North can remain 
cool-headed, exercise restraint, stop fighting immediately and 
resolve their disputes through consultation and dialogue," he 
said, adding that China hopes domestic stability is quickly 
restored. 
  Qian made the remarks yesterday in Beijing during a meeting 
with Fahim bin Sultan al-Qasimi, secretary-general of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council (GCC). 
  Qian said China hopes to continue to strengthen ties with 
the 
GCC adding that increased exchanges in recent years have been 
very beneficial. He also said the economies of China and Gulf 
countries are complementary and there is a bright future for 
cooperation. 
  In the Gulf, Qian said China appreciates the GCC's efforts 
to 
maintain regional peace and stability. "China believes that the 
unsettled questions in the Gulf region have to be solved through 
consultation and dialogue among the parties concerned on the 
basis of the UN Security Council resolutions," he said. 
  This will help quickly restore peace and stability and allow 
the war-torn countries to develop their national economies, 
improve peoples' livelihoods and cultivate regional 
co-operation, he said.

this end. Al-Qasimi said the Gulf countries want to develop 
long-term and friendly relations with China, adding that the two 
share similar views on many world and regional issues.

Sino-US bilateral relations.

occasions.

<F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing and Daniel Kwan] </F>
  [Text] In another apparent concession to the United States 
to win renewal of most favoured nation (MFN) trading status, 
China is allowing a dissident scholar to visit New York after a 
two-year battle. Yu Haocheng -- who was officially accused of 
"plotting and instigating the counter-revolutionary rebellion" 
in 1989 -- said the authorities issued him with a passport this 
week and all he needed was a U.S. visa. He expected to depart 
at the end of the month. "I'm very happy, of course. I've been 
applying for permission for the past two or three years. I want 
to go out and learn new ideas," Mr Yu said yesterday. 
  He will accept an invitation from Columbia University to 
spend up to a year there as a visiting scholar researching law, 
his field of expertise. He said he was not sure what role the 
MFN debate had played in his new-found freedom but observers 
said the permission was an attempt to prove that China was 
making the "significant progress" in human rights required by 
U.S. President Bill Clinton for extension of the special trade 
status. 
  A diplomat in Washington said Mr Yu's case was one of the 
major "blocked-passport cases" that U.S. officials had discussed 
with Beijing. 
  A dissident in Beijing said the development might be part of 
efforts to kick dissident leaders out of the country. 
  Hong Kong-based lobbyist John Kamm yesterday welcomed the 
news, saying Mr Yu's had been "the most important case the US 
has been pressing" with China in the past few years. 
  Mr Yu, 68, was arrested soon after the June 4, 1989, Beijing 
massacre, and held under round-the-clock guard at a school run 
by the paramilitary People's Armed Police for 18 months. He was 
eventually released with no charges being laid. A former 
director of the China Legal System and Social Development 
Research Institute, he incurred political hardliners' wrath 
after appealing in May 1989 for the student movement to be 
declared "patriotic." Shortly afterwards, the Chinese 
Government included him on a list of 40 "anti-party coalition" 
supporters of ousted Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang. 
  Mr Yu, a member of the New York-based Human Rights in China 
group, said he was likely to meet Chinese human rights advocates 
in the U.S. But he said he believed it would be best for China, 
the U.S. and human rights advocates in China for MFN to be 
extended. 
  Sources said a brother and a sister of former Tiananmen 
Square student leader Chai Ling were also likely to be given 
passports to leave the country.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" by Cary Huang, China editor] </F>
  [Text] Shocked by alarming economic data for the first 
quarter of this year, China's cabinet has decided to reimpose 
its austerity program in an attempt to check the runaway economy. 
  The austerity measures initiated by Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji 
last June, but largely lifted later due to pressure from senior 
leader Deng Xiaoping, would be reimposed, the State Council said 
in a recent circular. 
  Besides reviving the original 16 measures, the government 
has 
also banned new investment in fixed assets and banned further 
expansion of approved projects, expansion of new economic and 
technology zones, and the expansion of those zones already 
approved. It has also banned land auctions by local government 
agencies for commercial buildings, villas, and luxury 
residential housing or the further expansion of such projects 
that have already been approved. 
  Economic analysts said both Hong Kong business and the 
mainland economy would be affected by the revival of the tough 
policies. 
  In the circular, the government said the economic 
rectification measures introduced in the middle of last year 
would continue because the policies had not yet achieved their 
objectives in full. Admitting that the economy was now on the 
brink of being overheated, the central government called on 
regional governments, economic agencies, and financial 
institutions to work together to check uncontrolled growth. 
  Prompted by alarming figures for the first quarter of the 
year, the State Council and the Communist Party's central 
leading group on finance and the economy called a joint meeting 
recently to discuss measures to rescue the fragile economy, 
Chinese sources said. 
  The circular said statistics in the past months showed that 
three major economic indicators had been broken by great 
margins, which it said was a dangerous signal. 
  The government had set three major economic targets for 
overall economic development this year: 
  The annual gross national product growth rate should be 9 
per 
cent, of which the industrial output growth rate should be 10.2 
per cent. 
  Consumer price inflation should be maintained at less than 
10 
per cent. 
  Total capital investment should be kept to 1,300 billion 
yuan 
(HK$1.16 trillion), an increase of about 9 per cent over last 
year. 
  However, statistics showed industrial output had increased 
18.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year and 20 per cent 
in April; the overall price index had risen about 20 per cent, 
with 35 leading cities at 26 per cent, and investment had 
increased by 40 per cent, 31 percentage points higher than the 
state plan called for. 
  Mr Zhu unveiled a 16-point austerity plan in June last year 
which was aimed at tightening credit, attaining financial 
discipline and monetary order and laying down precise directions 
on economic growth. The controversial plan was largely undone a 
few months later after a remark by reclusive leader Deng 
Xiaoping, who apparently favoured a faster pace of reform and 
growth. He said that only a certain pace of development would 
pass the test of truth. 
  Mr Zhu's program, which included raising interests rates, 
calling in speculative loans, and cutting government 
administrative spending by 20 per cent, was a mixture of methods 
from China's old planned command-economy and from the new 
market-oriented system. It demanded: Forced bond sales, 
rolling back an earlier market reform experiment; suspension of 
new price-reform measures; a ban on most new government imports 
of cars and smaller investment projects; and an end to dubious 
fundraising schemes. 
  The current circular said the revival of the austerity 
measures was aimed at containing the three major economic 
indicators, saying it was the major task for government 
departments and economic officials at all levels. "Local 
governments and economic officials at all levels should work 
hard to contain the situation from further deterioration," a 
Chinese economic source quoted the circular as saying.

  [Text] Fuzhou, May 11 (CNS)--Fujian's provincial 
government has decided to regulate prices of nine categories of 
daily necessities and 50 basic services to curb inflation there. 
  The nine categories of daily necessities include grain, 
edible oil, meat and poultry, eggs, aquatic products, fresh 
vegetables, seasonings, milk and milk products as well as 
household articles. 
  The provincial government has stipulated that among these 
categories, adjustment to the prices set by the government must 
be reported to a high-level authority for filing, while the 
adjustment to other prices which had been regulated by market 
forces must be reported to the relevant department for 
examination five days ahead of implementation of the adjustment. 
  The government has also asked authorities at various levels 
there to set up and improve the system of reserving important 
foods such as grain, edible oil and meat as well as grain risk 
funds and the strengthening of macro-control and adjustment of 
prices of non-staple foods. [sentence as received] Those found 
breaching regulations will be seriously dealt with.

  [Text] While marked results have been achieved in the 
extensive implementation of the shareholding system over the 
last two years, a number of problems have cropped up, as well. 
Yi Zhenqiu, chairman of the provincial commission for 
restructuring economy, pointed out: If these problems are not 
solved promptly, not only will they hamper the development of 
shareholding companies, but they also will affect the healthy 
development of the securities market. It has been learned that 
there are four main problems currently facing our province's 
experiments with the shareholding system: 
  1. People have a one-sided understanding of the shareholding 
system. So far, some people still regard the establishment of 
shareholding companies exclusively as a way of raising funds. 
After funds are raised, investment projects frequently are 
altered at will. 
  2. Some companies' asset assessments are inflated and some 
individual companies juggle the figures on their financial 
reports and make false reports on profits in order to lure 
residents to buy their shares. 
  3. The government and relevant management departments have 
not managed companies in accordance with the rules and 
regulations by which limited-liability shareholding companies 
should abide. 
  4. The first- and second-class markets are not converged 
properly. 
  Yi Zhenqiu pointed out that the ultimate goal of the 
shareholding system is to establish the independent status of 
enterprises so they will become the main players on the market 
and will change the way they operate. Shareholding companies 
should be responsible to all the shareholders, and on no account 
should they do anything harmful to the shareholders.

2430): "Work Together in Building a Broad Way Leading to Hong 
Kong's Return -- Writing at a Time When Preliminary Working 
Committee Members From Interior China Are Leaving Hong Kong for 
Beijing"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 10 May (XINHUA) -- After successfully 
completing their agenda in Hong Kong, all 16 Chinese members of 
the Administrative and Economic Subcommittees of the Preliminary 
Working Committee [PWC] for the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region [HKSAR] Preparatory Committee have left Hong Kong for 
Beijing today. This was the first time the PWC held 
subcommittee meetings in Hong Kong since the PWC was founded in 
July last year; and it was also the first time that PWC members 
from interior China visited Hong Kong. People in Hong Kong 
universally welcomed the meetings and the visit because they 
fully reflected the sincerity which PWC members demonstrated in 
establishing widespread contacts with the Hong Kong people, in 
listening to their heartfelt wishes, and in strengthening ties 
with them; and also because they also reflected PWC members' 
open-mindedness, democratic and pragmatic workstyle, and 
earnestness. 
  During the short eight-day period, the PWC's administrative 
and economic subcommittees respectively held their seventh 
meetings -- each of which lasted two days -- to examine the work 
in the past six months; and they reached common understanding on 
certain issues, including the principles for forming the first 
legislative council in the HKSAR, and coordination between Hong 
Kong and interior China on capital construction projects. These 
were the major successes that members of the two subcommittees 
achieved during their stay in Hong Kong. 
  The convening of the PWC meetings in Hong Kong has enormous 
and far-reaching significance and influence because, on the one 
hand, it enabled members from interior China to examine Hong 
Kong's social, political, and economic life themselves so that 
they could understand Hong Kong more specifically and more 
directly, and so that PWC operations will occur more in line 
with the true state of affairs in Hong Kong. On the other hand, 
it helped the vast number of Hong Kong people acquire a deeper 
understanding of PWC operations, and it also strengthened the 
ties and communications between the PWC and Hong Kong people, 
thus providing a concrete guarantee for successful PWC 
operations and for a smooth transition in Hong Kong. 
  Aside from the tightly scheduled meetings, PWC members from 
interior China also took advantage of the precious opportunity 
to meet with members of 30 grass-roots organizations and 
political groups in Hong Kong to hear their views and 
suggestions on Hong Kong and PWC affairs during the transitional 
period; to inspect Hong Kong's consolidated exchange, citizens' 
public housing village, and container wharf; and to discuss 
important transition matters with National People's Congress 
deputies, members of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, as well as Hong Kong 
and district affairs advisors who were in Hong Kong. Speaking 
at luncheons hosted by five chambers of commerce, including the 
Hong Kong China Chamber of Commerce, Lu Ping, PWC vice chairman 
and secretary general, profoundly and specifically elaborated on 
the origin and contents of the "one country, two systems" policy 
as well as China's general and specific policies for Hong Kong. 
The widespread contacts which the PWC members from interior 
China established with Hong Kong's grass roots, their many 
contacts with mass organizations, the many subject matters they 
discussed, and the depth of the discussions all show the 
sincerity of PWC members from interior China toward establishing 
a genuine dialogue with the vast number of Hong Kong people, the 
importance they attached to Hong Kong people's heartfelt wishes, 
and their open-mindedness and democratic work style. All this 
has strengthened the understanding and mutual trust between the 
PWC and Hong Kong people and built the foundation for more 
effective PWC operations in the future. 
  Affairs closely related to Hong Kong people's vital 
interests 
have always been the PWC's focus of attention since its 
founding. The PWC Economic Subcommittee has also set up research 
panels to study several issues of concern by people in Hong 
Kong. During their stay in Hong Kong, PWC members from interior 
China also extensively listened to the views and suggestions of 
people of all strata and various groups about "high land prices, 
high rents, and high housing prices" as well as retirees' 
security and stabilization of civil servants' ranks -- issues 
which all people in Hong Kong have been following with great 
interest. This shows that the PWC attaches great importance to 
the interests of people in Hong Kong and that it holds itself 
responsible to the people in Hong Kong. 
  The PWC's main task is to work to facilitate preparations 
for 
the HKSAR so that the policies of "one country, two systems" and 
the "administration of Hong Kong by people in Hong Kong" can be 
implemented, Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-range 
prosperity and stability can be ensured, and people in Hong Kong 
can live and work in contentment after 1997 and can work 
together to create an even more prosperous Hong Kong. The 
extensive contacts and communications between the PWC members 
from interior China and people in Hong Kong show that PWC 
operations require the active involvement of Hong Kong's people, 
that people in Hong Kong are glad to be involved, and that 
communications, understanding, and cooperation between the PWC 
and people in Hong Kong are entirely possible. 
  People are pleased to note that when people of all strata in 
Hong Kong contacted the PWC, they could act with candor, say all 
they wanted to say, and could present their many enlightening 
and constructive views and proposals. Some even came forward 
with detailed, comprehensive, thoroughly investigated, and 
earnestly researched proposals on certain issues. All this has 
fully demonstrated the Hong Kong people's sense of 
responsibility as masters of Hong Kong -- a sense exemplified by 
their readiness to cooperate closely with the PWC as well as 
their patriotism and love for Hong Kong. Their views and 
proposals, which are important for the PWC to take into account 
in its future operations, constitute one of the biggest rewards 
PWC members from interior China acquired during their stay in 
Hong Kong. 
  People of all walks of life in Hong Kong followed closely 
the 
visit which PWC members from interior China paid in Hong Kong, 
and all media in Hong Kong reported the members' activities and 
the meetings' progress. Many scholars, experts, and celebrities 
expressed their views and suggestions on PWC operations and Hong 
Kong's future in newspaper and magazine articles. The PWC has 
become a thread connecting the vast number of people in Hong 
Kong. It has rallied more and more people in Hong Kong to work 
hard together to achieve the historical tasks of achieving "one 
country, two systems" and the "administration of Hong Kong by 
Hong Kong people," ensuring Hong Kong's smooth transition, and 
maintaining its prosperity and stability. 
  "One country, two systems" is a great, broadminded, and 
creative concept, and the materialization of this great concept 
as well as the actual work involved also require the same 
broadmindedness and the spirit that we can achieve anything if 
we are united. While the PWC members from interior China have 
now left Hong Kong for Beijing, we hope that the ties and 
communications between the PWC and people in Hong Kong will 
continue to strengthen. The many grass-roots organizations and 
celebrities in Hong Kong who are willing to work hard for Hong 
Kong's future have already built a strong and unimpeded avenue 
of communications between the PWC and people in Hong Kong. 
  It has been the aspiration of countrymen in Hong Kong for 
several generations over the past 150 years or so to completely 
remove the humiliation of colonial rule, return to the embrace 
of the motherland, and enjoy again the dignity and pride of a 
great nation. Today, history has bequeathed on us the great task 
of accomplishing this historical mission. Our motherland, which 
is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, will provide the 
strong support for accomplishing this mission. Hong Kong's 
brilliant tomorrow has already been outlined in the blueprint of 
"one country, two systems." While working hard for Hong Kong's 
future, the PWC members and the vast number of people in Hong 
Kong are also working on the project of building a broad way 
leading to a bright future with Hong Kong's return to the 
motherland. We are fully convinced that, with the involvement 
and support of the vast number of people in Hong Kong, all 
preliminary work facilitating the preparations for the HKSAR 
will be accomplished on time, and the "Pearl of the Orient" 
under the five-star red flag will shine with even greater 
brilliance!

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Two 
Chinese-Americans were sentenced to prison by a local court 
today for swindling, and forging official documents and seals. 
  This was the final verdict made by the higher people's court 
of Hebei Province on a case involving 200 standby letters of 
credit to the amount of 10 billion U.S. dollars and the Hengshui 
Branch of Agricultural Bank of China (HBABC) last April. 
  Francisco Hung Moy was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment 
and his property confiscated, followed by deportation. His 
accomplice, Raymond C. Lee, was sentenced to 14 years' 
imprisonment, also followed by deportation. 
  Both Moy and Lee are U.S. citizens. According to China's 
criminal law, they will be deported after they have finished 
their terms of imprisonment. 
  Zhao Jinrong, former director of the HBABC, was sentenced to 
11 years' imprisonment with deprivation of his political rights 
for two years for dereliction of duty and revealing state 
secrets; Xu Zhiguo, the deputy director, was sentenced to 19 
years' imprisonment with deprivation of his political rights for 
three years for dereliction of duty and providing state secrets 
to people from outside the Chinese mainland. 
  The Hengshui Intermediate People's Court of Hebei Province 
conducted public trials of the two cases on April 18, 19, 22 and 
23. 
  The court notified the U.S. Embassy in China of the date of 
the trial beforehand, in accordance with a Sino-U.S. consular 
treaty. Moy, Lee and the other defendants hired defense lawyers, 
who notified the relatives of the accused of the date of the 
trial beforehand. 
  After the sentence, Moy, Lee and the other defendants 
appealed to the provincial higher court, which rejected the 
appeal and upheld the verdict after an overall review of the 
whole case. 
  Moy, the 45-year-old chairman of the "United Asia (Group) 
Corporation", and Lee, 44, finance manager of the corporation, 
contacted the HBABC in March 1993, and passed on to Zhao Jinrong 
and Xu Zhiguo documents regarding introduction of foreign 
capital into China. 
  During discussions, Moy and Lee claimed that their 
corporation had many powerful business partners in many 
countries, and that they would mortgage their own negotiable 
securities, treasury bonds and assets abroad to get funds from 
outside China. The standby letters of credit issued by the 
HBABC was only to certify that the foreign capital had been used 
in China. 
  On April 1 and 2, 1993 Zhao Jinrong signed with Moy and Lee 
three agreements on "co-operatively introducing foreign capital 
for investment and development projects" to the amount of five 
billion, 1.6 billion and 3.4 billion U.S. dollars, respectively. 
  Lee produced for the HBABC a "proxy statement on opening 
letters of credit" afterwards, claiming that the HBABC was not 
obliged to pay back any principal or interest on the funds being 
introduced into China nor did it bear any economic or legal 
responsibility arising from the issuance of the letters of 
credit. 
  In the Chinese translation of the English original of the 
standby letter of credit lee gave to Zhao Jinrong and Xu Zhiguo, 
he deliberately left out the words, "accompanied by a signed 
statement by the beneficiary certifying that the amount of 
drawing represents indebtedness due from United Asia (Group) 
Corporation in connection with loan accommodation granted to 
United Asia (Group) Corporation". 
  Zhao and Xu issued 200 irrevocable and transferable standby 
letters of credit to the amount of 10 billion U.S. dollars on 
April 5. Moy and Lee sent all the standby letters of credit 
abroad the next day. 
  When some foreign companies inquired about the authenticity 
and reliability of the standby letters of credit, Moy and Lee 
cheated Zhao again into agreeing to a reply letter prepared by 
them, by repeating their lie that the letters of credit caused 
no risk to the bank. 
  On April 18, in the name of the fabricated "United National 
Republic Bank", Moy and Lee made up a standby letter of credit 
to the amount of 10 billion U.S. dollars as security guarantee 
against the standby letters of credit issued by the HBABC. 
  Meanwhile, Moy and Lee signed a "loan agreement" with a 
foreign company, which stipulated: The United Asia (Group) 
Corporation would borrow 7.5 billion U.S. dollars from this 
company and "the collateral shall be one-year standby letters of 
credit drawn on the Agricultural Bank of China". It also made 
it clear that united Asia group "does not have the 
responsibility to repay the principal." 
  Besides, Moy and Lee illegally engraved the official seals 
of 
the "Agricultural Back of China, Hebei Branch" and forged the 
confirmation letter for two standby letters of credit to the 
amount of 1.68 billion U.S. dollars for some foreign swindlers 
from February to April 1993. 
  The court held that the swindle caused severe social damage, 
infringed upon the rights and interests of the Agricultural Bank 
of China and seriously hampered China's financial and social 
order. 
  At the same time, Zhao Jinrong and Xu Zhiguo fell for the 
lies of the swindlers. Violating the provisions on management 
of foreign currency, they exceeded their power and issued 
standby letters of credit for huge amounts of money. They also 
transgressed the laws and regulations on keeping secrets and 
provided state secrets to people from outside the Chinese 
mainland, which infringed on the interests of the country. 
  It was learned that after the crime had been committed, 
judicial departments and other relevant administrations of China 
took a series of measures. And with the co-operation of police 
and financial institutions of other countries, no money was paid 
out during the validity period of the 200 standby letters of 
credit.

  [Text] While meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State 
Kissinger at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this afternoon, 
President Jiang Zemin said confrontation between China and the 
United States will do no one any good, adding that the 
development of cooperation between the two countries will 
benefit the peoples of the two countries and the people of the 
world. 
  Jiang Zemin said: China and the United States bear an 
important responsibility for the future of the world and the 
destiny of mankind. We should do something for the people of 
the world. Although there are some disputes, some problems, and 
differences between the two countries, in the final analysis, 
efforts should be made to improve relations between them. This 
is required for world peace and stability. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Practice demonstrates fully that Sino-U.S. 
relations are not merely limited to bilateral ties but are 
closely related to the international situation. In the past, 
Sino-U.S. relations developed more smoothly whenever both sides 
were able to overcome their differences in social systems and 
value concepts, proceeded from their common interests, developed 
mutually beneficial cooperation, and continually expanded common 
points on the basis of mutual respect, noninterference in each 
other's internal affairs, and treated each other on an equal 
footing. However, Sino-U.S. relations met with difficulties or 
setbacks, or even regressed whenever these principles were 
violated, differences over ideology were stressed, the other 
side's interests were ignored, views were imposed on others, and 
sanctions and pressure were applied. These historical lessons 
are very profound. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: A good opportunity has presented 
itself for the development of Sino-U.S. relations. It is hoped 
that both sides will grasp the opportunity, respect each other, 
seek common ground while reserving differences, and work 
together on the basis of the principles set forth by the three 
Sino-U.S. communiques, so as to enable their relations to 
develop on a healthy and normal track. 
  During the meeting, Jiang Zemin praised Dr. Kissinger for 
working vigorously to develop Sino-U.S. relations with the 
foresight of a strategist and the courage of a statesman, saying 
that this is commendable. 
  Kissinger said: I have always been against the use of the 
most- favored-nation trading status [MFN] as a means to exert 
pressure on China; I am also against putting pressure on China. 
I hope to see greater improvements in U.S.-Sino relations. 
  Present at the meeting were Minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, 
and others.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin, in meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger here today, said that world peace and stability call 
for improved Sino-U.S. relations, which are not restricted only 
to bilateral dimensions, but closely linked with the 
international situation. 
  In the 70-minute meeting, Jiang said that Kissinger, with 
the 
foresight of a strategist and the courage of a statesman, has 
always worked for the development of Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Discussing the world situation, Jiang noted that after the 
end of the cold war, the multi-polarization of the world 
structure is increasing, with the international situation moving 
towards relaxation and economic interests becoming a leading 
factor for the development of international relations. 
  "It represents the common wish of all peoples in the world 
to 
seek relaxation of tensions, cooperation and progress," Jiang 
said. 
  "However, the end of the cold war has not brought about 
overall peace, and some regions suffer from turbulence and even 
continuous wars," Jiang said, adding that such a situation has 
aroused concern from across the world. 
  As two big nations that have international influence, China 
and the United States "shoulder an important responsibility for 
the future of the world and the fate of mankind," a Chinese 
source quoted Jiang as saying. 
  After a review of the growth of Sino-U.S. relations, Jiang 
said that confrontation between China and the United States 
benefits neither side, while cooperation brings benefits not 
only to the two peoples, but to world peace in general as well. 
  Despite some disputes, problems or differences of one kind 
or 
another between the two countries, Sino-U.S. relations need to 
be improved, Jiang said, calling this "the need for world peace 
and stability." 
  Practice shows that Sino-U.S. relations have never been 
restricted to bilateral dimensions alone, but are closely linked 
with the international situation, Jiang said. 
  "When Sino-U.S. relations have enjoyed smooth growth, it has 
always been when the two sides could overcome the differences in 
social systems and concepts of values, proceed from the common 
interests to develop mutually-beneficial cooperation on the 
basis of mutual respect, practice non-interference in each 
other's internal affairs and equality, and strive to expand 
common ground," he noted. 
  In contrast, when those principles were violated and 
ideological differences emphasized, in cases of imposing one's 
own views upon the other side or even resorting to sanctions and 
exerting pressure, Sino-U.S. relations have encountered 
difficulties, set-backs or even retrogression, Jiang said, 
calling those "profound historical lessons." 
  Jiang, noting that the development of Sino-U.S. relations is 
facing a good opportunity at present, said that the two 
countries should seize the opportunity to work together, in the 
spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while 
reserving differences, so as to ensure expansion of bilateral 
ties along a healthy and normal track, as well as on the basis 
of the three Sino- U.S. joint communiques. 
  Kissinger said that a friendly relationship between the 
United States and China is essential for peace and stability in 
Asia and the world at large. Also, he said he has always 
opposed using the MFN [most-favored nation] status to exert 
pressure on China and exerting pressure on China in general. 
  Kissinger said he hoped to see greater improvement of 
u.S.-China relations, according to a Chinese official.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- While meeting with 
former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger at the Diaoyutai state 
guesthouse this afternoon, President Jiang Zemin said that 
Sino-U.S. relations have never been limited to bilateral ties 
but rather are closely related to the international situation. 
Sino-U.S. relations should be improved, for this is required 
for world peace and stability. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, President Jiang Zemin 
extended a welcome to Kissinger for making another trip to 
China. He said: Dr. Kissinger has always worked unswervingly 
and vigorously to develop Sino-U.S. relations with the foresight 
of a strategist and the courage of a statesman. This is 
commendable. 
  He said: After the end of the cold war, the trend of 
multipolarization in the world has been intensifying, and the 
international situation as a whole is moving toward a 
relaxation; economic interests are becoming the main factor 
having a bearing on international relations. The universal 
desire of the people of all countries is seeking a relaxation, 
cooperation, and progress. However, the end of the cold war has 
not brought about universal peace for the people of the world. 
Turbulence and unceasing military conflicts have continued in 
many regions. This situation cannot but draw the universal 
concern of the people of the world. He stressed: "China and the 
United States, as two powers having a considerable influence on 
the world, bear an important responsibility for the future of 
the world and the destiny of mankind. We should do something 
for the people of the world." 
  After reviewing the course of the development of Sino-U.S. 
relations, Jiang Zemin pointed out: Confrontation between China 
and the United States will do no one any good, but the 
development of cooperation between the two countries will 
benefit the peoples of the two countries and the people of the 
world. Although there are some disputes, some problems, and 
differences between the two countries, in the final analysis, 
efforts should be made to improve relations between them. This 
is required for world peace and stability. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Practice demonstrates fully that Sino-U.S. 
relations have not been merely limited to bilateral ties but are 
closely related to the international situation. In the past, 
Sino- U.S. relations developed more smoothly whenever both sides 
were able to overcome their differences in social systems and 
value concepts, and when they proceeded from their common 
interests, developed mutually beneficial cooperation, and 
continually expanded common points on the basis of mutual 
respect, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, and 
treated each other on an equal footing. However, Sino-U.S. 
relations met with difficulties or setbacks or even regressed 
whenever these principles were violated, differences over 
ideology were stressed, the other side's interests were ignored, 
views were imposed on others, or sanctions and pressure were 
applied. These historical lessons are very profound. 
  Jiang Zemin stressed: A good opportunity has presented 
itself for the development of Sino-U.S. relations. It is hoped 
that both sides will grasp the opportunity, respect each other, 
seek common ground while reserving differences, and work 
together on the basis of the principles set out by the three 
Sino-U.S. communiques, so as to enable their relations to 
develop on a healthy and normal track. 
  Kissinger said: The maintaining of good relations between 
the United States and China is very important to peace and 
stability in Asia as well as in the world. He said that he has 
always been against the use of the most-favored-nation trading 
status as a means to exert pressure on China and that he is also 
against putting pressure on China. He expressed the hope of 
seeing greater improvements in U.S.-Sino relations. 
  According to a Chinese official, the meeting took place in a 
cordial and friendly atmosphere. 
  Present at the meeting were Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade 
and economic cooperation; Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, and 
others.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren met with Henry Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of 
state, here today. They discussed bilateral relations between 
China and the United States and some international issues. 
  Rong expressed his appreciation over former U.S. President 
Nixon's efforts in opening the door of Sino-U.S. relations and 
in pushing the normalization of formal relations between the two 
countries. 
  Kissinger, as an assistant to the former U.S. president, has 
also made great contributions in this aspect, Rong said. 
  China hopes to see a peaceful and stable international 
environment and that differences between China and the U.S. 
should be solved through discussions and consultations on an 
equal footing, he stated. 
  Kissinger said he hoped that U.S.-China relations would be 
improved and developed in a "constructive way", and the trade 
between the two countries should also be separated from human 
rights and all other issues. He believed that the two countries 
can cooperate in a still wider sphere. 
  The meeting proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

  [Text] Washington, May 12 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today urged Congress to quickly pass the crime bill that 
would put 100,000 more police officers on the streets to fight 
crimes. 
  "It is imperative that we not let politics for one day delay 
the passage of this crime bill," Clinton said. "We can drive 
the crime rate down and make our people safe." 
  Announcing a 74-million-dollar federal grant to help local 
government pay for hiring 1,001 more police officers, he said 
the adoption of the crime bill will redeem his campaign pledge 
to put 100,000 additional police officers on American streets in 
its entirety. 
  The House and Senate have passed their own versions of the 
crime bill. The difference between the two versions will have 
to be reconciled by a conference committee. 
  In 1993, there were about 24,500 were murders, 12.1 million 
property crimes in the United States. 
  The federal grant and two previously announced awards, with 
a 
total of 150 million dollars, will go to 250 police departments 
across the country and help pay for the hiring or rehiring of 
2,023 police officers.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata today dispelled concerns that Tokyo may move toward 
active overseas military deployments. 
  Hata told a plenary session of the House of Representatives 
that Japan's Constitution prohibits the country's involvement in 
collective security and that he has no intention of changing the 
conventional interpretation of the constitution on this issue. 
  This was in response to a question from Yohei Kono, 
president 
of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
  The prime minister's remarks were apparently designed to 
ease 
apprehension among opposition legislators that his 
administration is moving toward more active involvement by 
Japan's Self-Defense Forces in international conflicts. 
  Hata also denied that Japan had secretly agreed with the 
United States in 1969 to allow Washington to deploy nuclear arms 
on Okinawa island to defend Japan and America's other Asian 
allies. 
  He was referring to a recent allegation in a book written by 
Kei Wakaizumi, former special emissary of then Prime Minister 
Cisaku Sato, that Sato and Nixon signed a top-secret memorandum 
at the White House on November 21, 1969, saying that Japan is 
aware of U.S. expectations for a favorable response to possible 
U.S. requests to deploy nuclear weapons on Okinawa in times of 
crisis.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Spokesman Denies Nuke Aid to DPRK"] </F>
  [Text] A foreign Ministry spokesman yesterday refuted an 
allegation by a US official that China has aided the nuclear 
programme and ballistic missile development of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  Wu Jianmin of the ministry called the charges by US 
Assistant 
Secretary of State Winston Lord "groundless and irresponsible." 
  Lord made the statements before a US Senate Foreign Affairs 
Subcommittee meeting on May 4. 
  He said China has assisted the DPRK in the development of 
ballistic missiles and nuclear devices. 
  Wu said China hopes all parties involved in the nuclear 
inspection crisis adopt constructive and positive attitudes to 
reach an early settlement through dialogue. 
  He also said at the briefing that China has noticed genuine 
concern in Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's statement that 
Japan's past aggression and colonial rule inflicted unbearable 
suffering on many people. 
  China appreciates his indications that history shall be 
treated correctly and the younger generation shall learn a 
correct historical view Wu said. 
  Wu also announced that Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Stepanovich Chernomyrdin will pay an official visit from May 26 
to 29, the first time a Russian premier will come to China. 
  Since President Boris Yeltsin's visit in February 1992, Wu 
said, Sino-Russian relations have undergone steady development 
in all fields. 
  He said Chernomyrdin's trip will bring new energy to 
existing 
ties, particularly economic and trade relations. 
  He also announced President Pascal Lissouba of the Republic 
of Congo will visit China from May 19 to 25 at the invitation of 
President Jiang Zemin.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin today stressed the importance of stability, saying China's 
stability is not only requisite for its own development, but 
will also benefit the stability and prosperity of Asia and the 
world in general. 
  Jiang made the remark in meeting with Malaysian Prime 
Minister Mohamed Mahathir here this afternoon. 
  Jiang, quoting Mahathir's remarks made during a visit to 
China last year, said political stability is an important factor 
for economic development. "This makes a lot of sense and we 
have good knowledge of that," he said. "China needs stability, 
and so do Asia and the world in general. This is a crucially 
important issue," he added. 
  Referring to the political disturbance in June 1989, Jiang 
said that without the resolute measures taken then, China would 
not have enjoyed today's stability. "A bad thing has been 
turned into a good thing, and as a result, our reform and 
opening program has forged ahead with steadier, better and even 
quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought into fuller 
play," he said. 
  "History shows that anything conducive to our national 
stability is good," Jiang said. "In the past five years, China 
has enjoyed economic development, social stability and improved 
livelihood of the people, thanks to our consistent efforts to 
take stability as an overriding priority. Facts prove this is 
absolutely correct." 
  Stability forms a prerequisite and reform serves as a 
driving 
force, while development represents the goal, Jiang said, adding 
that the three factors interact to promote each other. 
  The importance of ensuring lasting national stability has 
become a common understanding of all the Chinese people, Jiang 
said. "The stability of China is not only needed for China's 
own development, but will also benefit the stability and 
prosperity of Asia and the world in general." 
  That is because the stability of China, which has a 
close-to-1.2-billion population, is of international 
significance, he said, noting that in the past decade and more, 
the stability and development of China have not only brought 
benefits to the Chinese people, but contributed to world peace 
and development as well. 
  On the regional situation, Jiang noted that the situation in 
Asia is developing in a good direction in general, with 
sustained economic development and constantly improving regional 
security. 
  Further efforts to safeguard regional peace and development 
reflect an issue that has won attention from leaders of Asian 
nations, he noted. "We are ready to work with Malaysia and 
other Asian countries towards peace and development in Asia." 
  In the meeting, Jiang noted that Mahathir's visit coincides 
with the 20th anniversary of Sino-Malaysian diplomatic 
relations, saying such ties have gained overall expansion in the 
past two decades, with fruitful cooperation in the political, 
economic, cultural, scientific and technological fields. 
  The traditional friendship between the Chinese and Malaysian 
peoples continues to expand, while vast potential exists for 
bilateral cooperation, Jiang said. 
  Continuous expansion of such relations will not only promote 
common prosperity of the two countries, but also will serve to 
enhance regional economic cooperation, he added. 
  Mahathir said that since last year, he has been encouraging 
Malaysian businessmen to invest in and expand trade with China. 
Malaysia is satisfied with the steady growth of economic and 
trade ties with China, he said. 
  Referring to his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton 
shortly before he came to China, Mahathir said he had stressed 
his opposition to imposing one's own views upon others and to 
using the MFN [most-favored nation] issue to exert pressure on 
China, according to a Chinese official. 
  After the meeting, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of 
Mahathir and his party.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng met with 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir at the Ziguang 
Pavilion of Zhongnanhai this afternoon. Both sides expressed a 
willingness to peacefully resolve the Nansha [Spratly] Islands 
issue through dialogue on the basis of friendly cooperation. 
  Li Peng extended a welcome to Mahathir for paying a working 
visit to China and for participating in the 1994 China Beijing 
international high-level economic forum. 
  During the meeting, both sides satisfactorily reviewed the 
all-round and rapid development of bilateral relations since the 
two countries established diplomatic relations 20 years ago, and 
they said that they would work together to further develop 
bilateral relations. 
  Li Peng said: After the end of the cold war, the world has 
been developing in the direction of multipolarization. This is 
the positive side, but many contradictions and problems exist 
that need to be resolved. 
  He said: World affairs should be managed jointly by all 
countries of the world. The practice of hegemony and power 
politics will get one nowhere. All countries, big or small, 
rich or poor, and strong or weak, are equal, and they should 
enter into friendly cooperation. Disputes between nations 
should be solved peacefully through consultation and dialogue on 
a equal footing. It is necessary to establish a world political 
and economic order that is just and reasonable. The United 
Nations should do something more for the developing nations. 
  In discussing former Japanese Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano's remark on the Nanjing Massacre, Li Peng said: Nagano's 
remarks, which reversed black and white and distorted history, 
show that there is a force in Japan which is attempting to 
negate and beautify its history of aggression. Naturally, the 
remarks were condemned by all Asian countries that suffered from 
Japan's aggression. 
  He said: After Shigeto Nagano made his remarks, the Hata 
administration has made many speeches and has taken some 
measures. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Hata himself has conveyed an oral 
message to Premier Li Peng. He expressed his regret over what 
happened and reiterated that he will carry out a deep 
self-examination on Japan's past aggression and colonial rule, 
and that the young generation will be educated accordingly. Li 
Peng expressed his appreciation for such efforts. 
  Li Peng said: Sino-Malaysian relations are very good. We do 
not have any problems that need to be resolved urgently. 
  Commenting on the Nansha Islands issue, Li Peng said: "We 
should resolve peacefully the issue through dialogue with 
statesmen's farsightedness and friendly attitudes. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping proposed long ago that we should put aside disputes and 
carry out joint development. We should explore and discuss the 
issues with Malaysia based on the above principle." 
  Mahathir said: Both Malaysia and China are developing 
countries which share many common points in dealing with both 
regional and international affairs. 
  He indicated: Malaysia very much appreciates China's stand 
of peacefully resolving the Nansha dispute and opposes the 
internationalization of the Nansha issue. Malaysia is willing 
to hold bilateral talks on the basis of friendly cooperation to 
seek ways to resolve this issue. 
  Commenting on democracy, Mahathir expressed his belief that 
we should respect the specific situations in various countries. 
It is not commendable or feasible to apply the same democratic 
concept to countries that are undergoing different stages of 
development.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
met here today with Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir 
and they both agreed on seeking a peaceful solution to the issue 
of the Nansha [Spratly] Islands based on friendly cooperation. 
  Li extended a welcome to his Malaysian counterpart on his 
working visit to China and attendance of the 1994 China summit 
meeting, a high-profile economic forum which ended here today. 
  During the meeting, both leaders expressed their willingness 
to further bilateral relations, which have seen full and speedy 
growth since the two countries established diplomatic ties 20 
years ago. 
  The Chinese premier said that after the cold war, the world 
has been developing in the direction of multi-polarization, 
which he believes is a positive trend; but on the other hand, 
there still remain many contradictions and problems to address. 
  Li said that world affairs should be jointly managed by all 
countries and that there is no room for power politics on the 
earth. 
  He said that all countries, big or small, rich or poor, 
strong or weak, should be treated equally, and disputes between 
nations should be settled through peaceful consultations and 
dialogues. 
  A just and rational world political and economic order 
should 
be set up, Li said, and the United Nations should do more for 
developing countries. 
  On the remarks made by former Japanese Minister of Justice 
Shigeta Nagano, in which Nagano distorted the history of Japan's 
aggression against China, Li said, the facts show that there is 
a force in Japan which attempts to distort and even beautify its 
aggression in history, which will surely be condemned by its 
Asian victims. 
  He said that the Hata government has taken a series of 
measures and delivered various speeches following Nagano's 
remarks. 
  A message from Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was later 
conveyed 
to Chinese Premier Li Peng promising that history shall be 
treated correctly and the younger generation shall be educated 
from a correct historical perspective. 
  The Chinese premier said he appreciated the profound 
introspection expressed by Prime Minister Hata over Japan's 
aggression and colonial rule. 
  On the Nansha Islands issue, Li said China will discuss the 
matter with Malaysia based on the principle of putting aside 
disputes and seeking joint exploration as proposed by Chinese 
leader Deng Xiaoping. 
  Mahathir said Malaysia very much appreciates China's stand 
of 
peaceful settlement of the Nansha issue and opposed an 
internationalization of the Nansha issue. 
  Both China and Malaysia are developing countries, he said, 
so 
they share many common points in dealing with both regional and 
international affairs. 
  On democracy, the Malaysian prime minister said, the 
concrete 
situation in different countries should be respected when 
talking about the issue of democracy, and it is not agreeable to 
apply the same concept of democracy to all countries in 
different stages of development.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 13 (XINHUA) -- "Let the Chinese

one country and community may not be at all applicable in 
another." 
  In an editorial entitled "The China Express", the English 
daily said, "a concerted push by some developed economies for 
China to accept and implement policies that are alien to it and 
not acceptable to the 1.2 billion Chinese citizens...would only 
result in driving China into isolation -- and this would 
certainly not benefit anyone." 
  "On the other hand, the region and indeed the world will 
stand to benefit from a wealthy and strong China." 
  "In the final analysis, as Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed 
said, its leaders and intelligentsia themselves must pick and 
choose from the methods of other countries which could possibly 
fit in with the conditions in China," the paper said. 
  Mahathir, who ends his three-day working visit to China 
today, said on Wednesday that "Southeast Asia should welcome a 
wealthy China as it "will become the engine of growth firstly 
for east Asia including Southeast Asia."

  [Text] Suzhou, May 13 (XINHUA) -- A ceremony to mark the 
official start in the construction of a joint land development 
project between China and Singapore was held here Thursday [12 
May]. 
  Located by Jinji lake in the eastern part of Suzhou city, 
the 
project covers an area of 70 sq km, and is expected to develop 
into a modern industrial park with modern industries as the main 
structure, and new- and high-technology as the leading sectors, 
complemented by service industries and public welfare services. 
  According to an agreement concluded by the two sides, the 
Suzhou Industrial Park will be developed in three stages. 
  The first stage will focus on building a trunk road linking 
the park with the downtown area and a 45-ha industrial district. 
  Construction of standardized workshops with a combined floor 
space of 90,000 sq m, 1,200 apartments and an office block is in 
full swing in the district, which is scheduled for completion in 
July next year. 
  In addition, the park is building a special highway linking 
the city with Shanghai's Hongqiao airport. 
  A number of Singapore companies will support the development 
of the project, with 65 percent of the shares owned by the 
Singapore side and the rest by the Chinese side.

  [Text] Oslo, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Norwegian Acting Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister Bjoern Tore Godal held talks here 
on Wednesday [12 May] night with Li Ruihuan, chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), on further developing the 
mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. 
  Li, who arrived here on Tuesday for a five-day visit to 
Norway, spoke highly of the cooperation between Norway and China 
after they established diplomatic ties more than 40 years ago. 
  He said that many new changes emerging after the Cold War 
have created favorable conditions for international cooperation 
and development. 
  He said, however, regional conflicts are increasing in the 
world and economic situation in many countries is worsening. 
Thus, preservation of world peace and promotion of economic 
development remain the two primary tasks for the international 
community. 
  Li stressed that China pursues a foreign policy of 
independence and peace and wishes to develop friendly relations 
with all countries in the world. 
  He added that all nations, small or big, weak or strong, 
poor 
or rich, have the right to equally participate in international 
affairs. 
  Li said that Western Europe plays an important role in 
international politics and economy, and China shares common 
views with it on many important international issues. 
  He said China would like to develop cooperation with the 
west 
including Norway on the basis of mutual respect, 
non-interference with each other's internal affairs, equality 
and mutual benefit. 
  Godal said that East Asia, which has been experiencing a 
fast 
economic growth, is playing a more and more important role in 
international affairs and China is an active stable factor there. 
  He said Sino-Norwegian relations have developed rapidly in 
recent years and his government wishes China more successes in 
its reforms. 
  He added that China's reform will benefit the world economy 
and the trade and economic cooperation between Norway and China.

(0002 3189 3932): "Chinese People's Association for Friendship 
With Foreign Countries Holds Grand Reception To Celebrate 40th 
Anniversary of its Founding"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 May (XINHUA) -- Personages from various 
circles of the national capital, representatives from all over 
the country, and foreign friends, totaling more than 800 
persons, happily gathered at the Great Hall of the People this 
evening to warmly celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding 
of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship With Foreign 
Countries. 
  At the grand reception held by the Chinese People's 
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, inscriptions 
written by party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao 
Shi, Li Ruihuan, and Qian Qichen for the founding anniversary 
were read. 
  Qian Qichen, vice premier of the State Council and 
concurrently foreign minister, gave a congratulatory speech at 
the reception. On behalf of the party Central Committee and the 
State Council, he extended heartfelt congratulations to the 
Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign 
Countries and high respects to all the Chinese and foreigners 
who were engaged in nongovernmental diplomatic work and made 
positive contributions to strengthening the friendship between 
Chinese people and the people of the various countries of the 
world. 
  Qian Qichen said: The Chinese People's Association for 
Friendship with Foreign Countries is one of the national 
nongovernmental organizations for friendship with foreign 
countries established earliest in China. It has played an 
important role in developing nongovernmental friendly contacts 
and cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries over 
the past 40 years. He said: The 40 years the Chinese People's 
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries has traversed 
were a period when it held high the banner of peace, friendship, 
unity, and cooperation and marched continuously along the road 
of human progress and social prosperity. Over the past four 
decades, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with 
Foreign Countries has made friends with many sincere people from 
various countries in the world for the Chinese people and made 
contributions to China's development and progress. 
  He said: "We will never forget the names of the many friends 
in the world engraved on the monument of China's revolution and 
construction. We wholeheartedly wish to associate with more 
friends in the world to make concerted efforts for human 
progress and China's prosperity." 
  Qian Qichen said: China's status and influence in the world 
have increasingly improved, and the various countries in the 
world have attached importance to improving and developing their 
relations with China and have expanded the exchanges and 
cooperation with China. This has provided a favorable 
international environment for us to build socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  He said that he was convinced that the Chinese People's 
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries would create a 
still higher level in its work under the correct leadership of 
the party Central Committee and the State Council, guided by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and China's foreign policy of 
independence and peace, and in reliance of the concerted efforts 
of the comrades on the nongovernmental diplomatic front. 
  Han Xu, president of the Chinese People's Association for 
Friendship with Foreign Countries, spoke first at the reception. 
He reviewed the brilliant course that the Chinese People's 
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries had traversed 
in the past 40 years and expressed thanks to friendly personages 
of various countries in the world for their tremendous support 
to the association. 
  Present at the reception were Lei Jieqiong and Wang 
Guangying, vice chairmen of the National People's Congress [NPC] 
Standing Committee; Huang Hua, former vice chairman of the NPC 
Standing Committee; Gu Mu, former vice chairman of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference; and Qi Huaiyuan, director of the Foreign Affairs

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Pan Gang (3382 1511) and XINHUA </F>
Reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474): "The National Rally To Commend 
Advanced Young Individual Workers Is Held, and Li Lanqing and 
Wang Bingqian Meet With Representatives and Deliver Speeches"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 May (XINHUA) -- The national rally to 
commend advanced young individual workers was ceremoniously held 
at the Great Hall of the People today. Li Lanqing, member of 
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice 
premier of the State Council, Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of 
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and 
Wan Guoquan, vice chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, met with 207 
representatives and took a group photo with them. 
  While meeting with the representatives, Li Lanqing said: I 
am very happy to meet with advanced representatives of 
individual workers and let me extend congratulations to all who 
have won this honor. As all people know that the socialist 
market economy is composed of various economic sectors with 
public ownership as the mainstay, and they are competing with 
one another at an equal footing, promoting one another, and 
seeking common development. This is a long-term national policy. 
During the past few years, the individual and private economies 
were filled with vigor and vitality. This achievement should be 
attributed first to the party's open policy, and second, to the 
painstaking and pioneering spirit and hard work of the 
individual workers. They have played an important role in 
promoting economic development, which is obvious to all. It is 
hoped that all of you will do business in line with law, rely on 
your honest labor and management ability to develop your own 
undertakings, and contribute to China's economic development. 
It is also hoped that all of you will not forget the virtue of 
the Chinese people, which means that one should not forget other 
people when become rich and that one should lead the local 
people to reach common prosperity. Meanwhile, it is also 
necessary to promote the spirit of feeling happy to help other 
people. For example, the activities to donate funds to support 
education should be conducted. 
  Li Lanqing said: Among the individual workers, many heroic 
models have emerged in addition to the emergence of a batch of 
outstanding entrepreneurs. Among the representatives present at 
this rally, one individual worker from Zhejiang was injured 
during a fire fighting. His deed is very touching. It is hoped 
that all of you will promote the spirit of being ready to take 
up the cudgels for a just cause, make common efforts, enable our 
economy to further develop, and achieve good results in building 
spiritual civilization. 
  In his speech, Wang Bingqian said: The development of the 
individual and private economies has played an increasingly 
noticeable role in promoting production, enlivening the economy, 
making the market brisk, invigorating circulation, making things 
convenient for living, expanding employment, and safeguarding 
social stability. At present, there are more than 17.6 million 
individual industrial and commercial units across the country 
with more than 29 million employees. This is an important force 
which can never be dispensable with in China's socialist 
construction cause. The undertakings engaged in by the 
individual workers are glorious, and are protected by the state 
law, which should be acknowledged by society and respected by 
the people. 
  This commendatory activity is co-sponsored by the Central 
Committee of the Communist Youth League, the State Industrial 
and Commercial Administrative Bureau, and the China Association 
of Individual Workers.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- China's Foreign Trade 
Law has provided a good start in providing a legal framework for 
China's foreign trade and a very important step in connecting 
China's economy with the world economy, said Wu Yi, minister of 
foreign trade and economic cooperation, here today. 
  She added that China's Foreign Trade Law, which was passed 
here today by the seventh meeting of the Standing Committee of 
the Eighth National People's Congress of China, is an 
epoch-making event in China's foreign trade history. 
  It will be the basic law in fields related to China's 
foreign 
trade, outlining basic principles, policies and a 
macro-management framework for China's foreign trade. 
  Wu said that China's foreign trade has witnessed drastic 
development during the past 15 years and, with China's further 
opening, China's economy will continue to join the world economy 
and has to be managed in line with international practice. 
  As far as foreign trade is concerned, the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) is a set of accepted world trade 
rules, she added. 
  She noted that China applied for the resumption of its 
contracting status in GATT in 1986, at which time GATT asked for 
the unification and transparency of foreign trade systems of its 
contracting parties. 
  Wu opined that without a foreign trade law, meeting the 
requirements of GATT is beyond imagination.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- China's legislature 
adopted the country's first foreign trade law here today to 
institute a unified foreign trade system. 
  It is claimed to be able to maintain a fair and free foreign 
trade order and is believed to be conducive to China's 
development in trade and economic cooperation with other 
countries as well as facilitating the establishment of the 
market economic structure. 
  The new law, consisting of 8 chapters and 44 articles, was 
passed at the closing of the Seventh Session of the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) today, over 
which its chairman, Qiao Shi, presided. 
  The NPC Standing Committee also passed the State 
Compensation 
Law today to make state functionaries adhere to laws in their 
operations. 
  It stipulates that citizens, legal persons and other 
organizations will be "compensated for their losses or suffering 
when their legal rights are harmed due to illegal deployment of 
power by state functionaries or state employees." 
  The lawmaking body also approved three decisions today: 
  -- The supplementary provisions to regulations governing 
offenses against public order, initiated by the ministry of 
public security, defined 18 new offenses, targeting 
newly-emerging public security problems in the country at the 
time of reform and opening to the outside world. 
  -- The amendments to the regulations on active service and 
rank of military officers of the People's Liberation Army are 
meant to meet increasing needs of the reform and construction 
drive of the the nation and the armed forces. 
  The first amendment takes two to three years off the ceiling 
age for officers of deputy-army level, officers at the level of 
deputy commander-in-chief for the greater military areas and 
officers with elementary professional posts. 
  The latter one spells out the disestablishment of 
first-class 
(highest ranking) general. It also stipulates that no military 
rank will be granted to the chairman of the central military 
commission. 
  Wang Yingwei and 12 other persons today were added to the 
membership of the Preliminary Working Committee for the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. 
  The NPC Standing Committee appointed Nie Li as a member of 
the NPC Internal Affairs and Judicial Committee, named Song 
Ruixiang and Sun Jiazheng as minister of geology and mineral 
resources and minister of radio, film and television, to replace 
Zhu Xun and Ai Zhisheng respectively. Guo Zhenqian was named 
auditor-general of the auditing administration to replace Lu 
Peijian.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- China named new 
ministers today for the Ministry of Geology and Mineral 
Resources and the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television, and an 
auditor-general for the auditing administration. 
  The appointments of Song Ruixiang, Sun Jiazheng and Guo 
Zhenqian to the top seats of the three ministries were 
respectively passed by the country's parliament at the Seventh 
Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress [NPC], which ended today. 
  Song Ruixiang, 54, has been working at grass-roots 
geological 
and mineral resource departments for a long time. He is cited 
to be "decisive, daring and resolute in work." 
  Since 1980, Song held the posts of deputy director of the 
provincial geological bureau of hunan, and deputy director and 
director of the geological bureau of Qinghai Province. 
  He became deputy secretary of the Qinghai Provincial 
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and governor of 
Qinghai Province in 1985. In 1989, he was named vice-minister 
of the geology and mineral resources. 
  The former geology minister Zhu Xun is now secretary-general 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. 
  Sun Jiazheng, 50, replaced Ai Zhisheng as minister of radio, 
film and television, who became deputy director of the 
ideological and media work group under the CPC Central Committee. 
  Sun, a university graduate, is noted for his "reliable and 
safe methods in working." He held the posts of secretary of the 
Nanjing City Committee of the Communist Youth League of China 
(CYLC), deputy secretary and later secretary of the CYLC Jiangsu 
Provincial Committee. 
  He became a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC 
Jiangsu Provincial Committee, its secretary-general and 
secretary of Xuzhou City Party Committee in 1983. In 1986 he 
became deputy secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party 
Committee and head of the committee's propaganda department. 
  He is also an alternate member of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee. 
  The former vice auditor-general Guo Zhenqian, 61, replaced 
Lu 
Peijian as auditor-general of the auditing administration. Lu 
has been appointed chairman of the board of auditors in China's 
new policy-lending bank, the Development Bank. 
  Guo is said to be "familiar with the macro-economy and a 
capable leader." 
  He was once director of the Hubei branch of the People's 
Construction Bank of China, and then vice-governor of Hubei 
Province, and later its governor. 
  Guo became vice-governor of the People's Bank of China in 
1990.

<F P=106> [By China Radio International reporter Chen Yong; from the </F>
"Current Affairs" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] China's economic reform has made tremendous progress 
but the country is facing a resources shortage, environmental 
pollution, and overpopulation. Vice Minister of the State 
Planning Commission Chen Yaobang says future development will 
pay more attention to sustainable development of the resources 
and the environment. He says China's National Agenda 21 aims at 
bringing industrial pollution under control by the year 2000. 
The National Agenda 21 covers the economic development, natural 
resources, environmental protection, agriculture, population, 
and education. The plan is China's response to the World Agenda 
21 endorsed by the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. All 
participating countries agreed to do their best to protect the 
environment. Premier Li Peng attended the Earth Summit and 
promised to implement the resolution on behalf of the Chinese 
Government. Vice minister Chen Yaobang says China's National 
Agenda 21 was approved by the State Council in March this year. 
  Chen Yaobang says China's National Agenda 21 considers the 
country's actual conditions and the relationship between the 
population, environment, and development in the next century. 
Chen Yaobang says the plan is the guiding principle for the 
nation's long and medium term social and economic plans. The 
formulation of the National Agenda 21 has involved over 300 
Chinese experts and has drawn the attention of the United 
Nation's Development Program [UNDP]. The UNDP has worked with 
the Chinese Government for making Agenda 21. Chen Yaobang says 
Agenda 21 will be implemented in three phases. Sixty-three 
projects are included in the first phase of the plan. The 
projects are aimed at obtaining international cooperation. Chen 
Yaobang says the preferential project will give a boost to 
China's sustainable development. He believes the implementation 
can have some influence over global development. However, he 
says the implementation is a huge amount of investment. 
  Chen Yaobang says the first stage of implementation needs 
$3.7 billion. The Chinese Government will cover 60 percent of 
the cost. The other 40 percent will be obtained through 
international donations. China is to hold an international 
donor conference in July to gain financial and technical 
assistance.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Five offenders were 
recently released from education-through-labor institutions 
before their terms expire, according to a department concerned 
here. 
  Chen Zhuman, Yan Peizhi, Xu Zhihe, Cui Tai and Zhang Li were 
ordered to be re-educated through labor respectively between 
December 1991 and September 1993 because of disturbing social 
order and endangering public security by making use of religion. 
  Decisions to release them were made by the 
eduction-through-labor committees of Quanzhou City in Fujian 
Province, Weifang City in Shandong Province and Zhangjiakou City 
in Hebei Province. The department concerned said that they were 
released ahead of time because they had been amenable to 
discipline and behaved themselves during correctional period.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Wang Bixue (3769 3024 1331) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zhang Yinshu (1728 6892 2562)] 
  [Text] 26 Mar, Beijing (XINHUA) -- At a national meeting 
on discipline inspection in procuratorial organs today, Zhang 
Siqing, procurator general of the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, pointed out: Procuratorial organs are an 
important force in the anticorruption struggle. They are also 
one of the departments designated by the central authorities as 
being of importance to the anticorruption struggle. To correct 
others, we must correct ourselves first. Procuratorial organs 
at all levels in the country must fight corruption in their own 
system and purify the procuratorial ranks to more effectively 
fulfill their roles in law supervision. 
  Zhang Siqing said: Procuratorial personnel are warriors at 
the frontline of the anticorruption fight, but they are also 
important targets which corrupt criminal elements try to win 
over to their side and corrode. From problems that have been 
exposed so far, we can see that only a small minority of the 
procuratorial ranks has violated the law and discipline. 
However, this fact has a very bad effect on the masses. It 
seriously ruins the image of procuratorial organs and damages 
the sanctity of the state legal system. Some procuratorial 
personnel have used their procuratorial authority to obtain 
personal gain or wantonly used their authority to infringe on 
the rights and interests of citizens, such as by using it to 
practice favoritism and commit fraud, to demand and receive 
bribes, and to leak classified information on cases which are 
being handled, and by wantonly using it to illegally detain 
people and extort confession by torturing people. These are the 
main manifestations of corrupt phenomena in procuratorial 
organs. We should focus on strictly investigating and dealing 
with these cases, which involve acts that violate law and 
disturb discipline. We must never connive with or tolerate such 
acts; nor should we cover up those acts or shield their 
perpetrators. 
  It has been made known that last year, while they were 
vigorously investigating and dealing with major and important 
cases involving corruption and bribery, the procuratorial organs 
focused on fighting corruption in their own system and scored a 
certain degree of success. Since August 1993, procuratorial 
organs at all levels have been comparing themselves to what is 
stipulated in provisions on honesty and self-discipline in order 
to investigate and correct themselves. At the same time, they 
have strictly investigated and dealt with cases involving 
procuratiorial organs and personnel who violated the law and 
discipline. They investigated and dealt with 568 personnel who 
violated the law or discipline, and they sorted out 24 types of 
fees and fines which were arbitrary collected or imposed within 
the procuratorial system.

  [Text] Instead of being outlawed by new regulations on 
religious venues, Chinese church leaders argue that a great 
majority of house churches will gain legal recognition and 
protection. But resistance is anticipated, particularly from 
lower level cadres, and conflicts are expected in the process of 
implementation. "There were reasons to fear that the process of 
implementation would not be without conflicts," Dr Konrad 
Raiser, general-secretary of the World Council of Churches, 
yesterday quoted church leaders in China as saying after a visit 
to China from May 5 to 11. 
  Official figures show that there are about seven million 
Christians in China, with a widely quoted 8,000 registered 
Protestant churches or 20,000 meeting places. But a larger 
number of believers stay outside the official Three Self 
Patriotic Church of China and prefer house churches. 
  House churches are estimated to have about 70 million 
members, and are branded underground by the Chinese Government. 
Violations against religious liberty by the state reportedly 
occur in these venues. "There is no prediction on what impact 
these decrees will have," Dr Raiser said. 
  But Chinese church leaders consider these rules progressive, 
he said, because local cadres who were largely without any 
control could now be held accountable. According to the new 
rules, the house churches now have to supply clear addresses, 
defined membership and clear financial conditions in order to 
register. Chinese church leaders expect a large number of the 
now unregistered meeting points to seek registration and public 
recognition for legal protection, Dr Raiser said.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Cable-stayed bridge 
design in China will be advanced synchronously with this 
industry in the world, according to a famous Chinese bridge 
expert. 
  "It will be advancing towards spans of over 1,000 meters 
sooner or later," Lin Yuanpei, general designer of the Yangpu 
bridge -- the world's longest -- told over 200 foreign 
specialists at a recent international symposium in this city. 
  He said that within a period of less than 20 years, China 
has 
proceeded to become one of the pioneers of the world in this 
field. 
  In the mid-1970s, China had only one cable-stayed bridge 
with 
a 76-meter span. 
  In the 1990s, two huge bridges were set up across the 
Huangpu 
river in shanghai. Nanpu bridge, built in 1991, boasts a span 
of 423 meters, and the Yangpu bridge, which was completed last 
year, is 602 meters in length. 
  So far, the country has 40-odd stay cables. 
  Lin also said that a third stay cable for Shanghai is on the 
drawing board and is expected to be finished in 1996. 
  The four-day symposium received over 90 theses on the latest 
developments in the field. 
  Some well-known experts took part in the meeting, including 
Li Guohao, honorary president of Tongji University.

  [Text] Ninety percent of the military commanders of the 
main combat fleet under the People's Navy have achieved an 
educational level equivalent to a regular university degree. 
This is one of the hallmarks of a new stage in the Navy's 
modernization. 
  According to what a reporter saw during a tour of a certain 
submarine detachment in the North Sea Fleet, officers and men 
have acquired a range of training methods aimed at improving 
their overall fighting capability with the assistance of 
existing equipment in complex settings; this has been made 
possible by the general improvement in their educational levels. 
Their detachment has been named as an all-army, advanced 
training unit for two consecutive years. [video shows a 
submarine anchored at sea, military officers in a meeting, and a 
submarine heading out to sea] 
  The Navy is a knowledge- and technology-intensive service. 
In its early days in 1949, most captains did not even have a 
primary school education. Since the fifties, the Navy Vessels 
Academy, the Navy Submarine Academy, and other naval academies 
aimed at training commanders for troops on surface vessels and 
submarines have been established one after another. Most of the 
Navy's primary-level commanding officers are graduates of those 
academies. Commanding officers of all ranks must undergo 
training anew in those academies or training groups if they want 
to be promoted. This will enable them to constantly renew their 
knowledge, improve their strategic and command skills, and 
master the various modern equipment and systems employed at 
their posts and their ranks. Nineteen cadres from a certain 
detachment in the East Sea Fleet have been admitted to Chinese 
University of Science and Technology and other major colleges 
and universities for graduate programs leading to master's and 
doctoral degree. [video shows file footage of old surface 
vessels, cutting to show naval personnel attending class and

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Air Force has 
scored marked achievements in training capable pilots. A few 
hundred pilots who are capable of meeting the challenge of air 
combat, who understand foreign languages, and who know how to 
operate computers are gradually becoming the Air Force's 
backbone force for striding from this to the next century. 
  According to a briefing by an Air Force department, the 
development of modern aviation technology and the improvement in 
the performance of weapons and equipment demand that pilots be 
very capable. For this reason, the people's Air Force added 
mathematics in pilot colleges. In addition, it organized 
English classes for pilots in 1983 and later added computer 
science and high-technology subjects, and all pilots are 
required to attend these classes on a rotational basis. At 
present, a few hundred pilots are able to understand, speak, 
read, write, and translate English; they have also mastered 
computer principles, computer programming, and computer 
operation and utilization. Through self-study, a number of 
pilots have mastered Russian and other languages, and a marked 
change in their level of knowledge has taken place. 
  Their advantages are clearly demonstrated in their flight 
training and contacts with foreign countries. According to a 
briefing, these pilots are more able to adapt to and accept new 
ways of flight training, and they especially do better in 
test-flying new-model aircraft and undergoing difficult training 
programs. Some pilots have even raised their training 
efficiency by 100 percent. In carrying out their flying mission 
to protect foreign guests, their outstanding performance has won 
many praises from foreign pilots and experts. An Air Force 
source said the increase in the number of capable pilots has 
great significance for raising the combat capability of the Air 
Force and for expanding contacts with foreign countries.

staff reporter Mo Xinyuan (5459 2450 0337): "Molding Oneself 
According to the Owner's Demand--Reports on Comprehensive 
Reforms Carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation (second installment)" -- first paragraph is editor's 
note] 
  [Text] Editor's Note: The first installment, entitled "The 
Market Calls For a New Role," mainly relates the Beijing First 
Light Industrial Corporation's efforts to explore reform before 
it became a state asset management company, suggesting that its 
transformation into a "new role" has been entirely the outcome 
of deepening reform and an inevitable progression in coping with 
market economic development. This article mainly explains the 
difference between the new Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation and the old one, following its transformation. What 
are its responsibilities and rights in its relations with the 
higher authorities? How will it affect its subordinate 
enterprises as the "boss" of state assets? How have they changed 
their relationship from one between "mother-in-law and 
daughter-in-law" to one between "mother and son?" 
  "The separation of asset management from government 
administration is an important condition for the separation of 
enterprise management from government administration. The 
universal significance of the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation's reform finds expression in the creation of state 
asset representatives in enterprises themselves. They can 
ensure and increase the value of state assets and operate state 
assets according to market economic demands." -- Written by a 
person in the State Structural Reform Commission who is familiar 
with the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation's reform. 
  At its 19th Standing Committee meeting on 13 August 1993, 
the 
Beijing Municipal Government decided to authorize the Beijing 
First Light Industrial Corporation to manage state assets. 
Subsequently, in accordance with the decision by the municipal 
government and under the specific guidance of the Beijing 
Municipal State Asset Administration, the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation completed the verification and appraisal 
of the corporation's state assets after three months of busy 
work. On 7 December of the same year, it registered the 
following: Legal person's name: The Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation. Registered capital: 1.288 billion yuan. 
First item in its business scope: State asset management. 
  In Beijing, this was the first enterprise granted the right 
to manage state assets. 
  After an enterprise is authorized to manage state 
assets, is it an operator or the owner's representative? If it 
is the former case, reform is stagnant; if it is the latter 
case, a breakthrough is made in reform. The Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation has transformed itself from an "employee" 
into the "boss" representative. 
  What does it mean to authorize an enterprise to manage state 
assets? On this question, this reporter [Mo Xinyuan] 
interviewed Cui Zhian, chairman of the board of the Beijing 
First Light Industrial Corporation. 
  [Cui] There are still different opinions on this question. 
Some people are still of the opinion that what has been granted 
to the enterprise is only an operationing right; the state is 
still the owner and the enterprise is only an operator. We do 
not agree with this view. In our opinion, this authorization 
has made us a representative of the owner who possesses that 
part of state assets. We represent the state in exercising 
ownership, therefore we are the owner. 
  [Mo] What is the difference between being an operator and 
being the owner? 
  [Cui] According to these people's opinion, the state is the 
owner and we are only the operator. In this case, our reform is 
stagnant. For a long time, the relation between management and 
ownership in state enterprises has been unclear. It has been 
unclear who will represent the owner of state assets. Under the 
planned-economy structure, the entire country was a great 
factory and all enterprises were its workshops. This no longer 
suits the market economy. Only when an enterprise becomes a 
competitive body of "four self's" [self-accumulation of funds, 
self-construction, self-management, and self-assumption of 
responsibility for profits and losses], can it enter the market. 
This is an essential demand of the market economy. If the 
enterprise is an operator and the state is the owner, problems 
will arise in two aspects. The first is that if the state is 
the owner, it is "false" because either everyone or no one can 
represent it--a case resulting in the falsification of the asset 
ownership body and a large-scale loss of state assets. The 
second aspect is that if the owner is represented by a 
government department, this will cause the mixing of enterprise 
management and government administration, and the enterprise 
will become the subsidiary of a government department. 
Moreover, if a government department is the owner, it will find 
it difficult to enter the production factors market or to engage 
in the trading of proprietary rights; thus it is also impossible 
to display the basic role of the market in optimizing resource 
distribution. 
  In its reform, the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation faced not only low economic results, but 
a number of problems as well, such as upgrading its production, 
adjusting its arrangements and structure, and optimizing its 
resource distribution. To resolve these problems, it will not 
do to rely on enterprise reform alone; there is a need to create 
a new type of state asset representative that can perform 
ownership over the part of state assets within the framework of 
authorization and also can operate this part of state assets in 
the market as an enterprise. 
  [Mo] With this authorization, the enterprise has ownership. 
Does this mean carving out state ownership over state assets? 
  [Cui] This is not carving out state ownership, but grading 
it. The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee formed the concept about the proprietary right 
of an enterprise's legal person. This is a major breakthrough 
in China's enterprise reform theory, and points out the 
orientation for clearly defining the relationship between 
management and ownership. The state has final ownership, 
whereas the enterprise has the legal person's proprietary right. 
This is graded ownership. Without this graded ownership, the 
separation of enterprise management from state administration 
will forever remain empty talk. Through our own reform, we have 
understood that the asset dispenser's ownership can be derived 
from between these two tiers of ownership. This asset 
dispenser's ownership will be undertaken by the state asset 
representative authorized by the state so as to ensure state 
asset value and increments in this value. The essence of 
authorized operation is the separation of government 
administration from asset management. The enterprise will 
operate this part of state assets and also can make investments. 
Therefore, the grading of state asset ownership does not change 
the nature of state ownership over state assets; it confirms the 
rational existence form, task, and responsibility of state asset 
ownership at different levels of economic operations according 
to market economic demands so as to promote state-owned economic 
development. Obviously, this falls into the category of system 
formation. 
  With this authorization, we have formulated regulations that 
provide, among other things, for the following: "This 
corporation is a state asset representative with legal 
registration and is a wholly state-invested corporation with 
limited liabilities." "As the asset owner, this corporation 
represents the state in operating and managing the part of state 
assets within the framework of government authorization." With 
this new status, we can possess the "key" to practicing the 
optimal distribution and rational circulation of the state 
assets in the former light industrial departments affiliated 
with the corporation. 
  It does not matter whether one's power is great or 
small, but the most fearful thing is undefined responsibility. 
With a clearly defined relationship between management and 
ownership, enterprises can perform their different duties and 
functions. The relationship between the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation and its affiliated enterprises has 
changed from one between "mother-in-law and daughter-in-law" to 
one between "mother and son." 
  The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has 122 
enterprises and institutions. These include enterprises 
manufacturing brand-name products, like the Xinghai Piano 
Factory, the Hongxing Brand Liquor Distillery, and a wristwatch 
factory. There are enterprise groups comprising dozens of 
enterprises, such as the glass group company, the paper 
manufacturing group company, and the Liyuan company. There are 
also 85 joint-venture factories, centers, and projects. What 
changes has the establishment of the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation as a state asset owner brought about in 
these enterprises? What impact has it had? Let us listen to 
Assistant General Manager Yang Zhide's explanations: 
  [Yang] After clearly defining the corporation's reform 
ideas, 
we held several discussions with enterprise leaders. Early this 
year, we held a work meeting for leaders of enterprises and 
institutions affiliated with the corporation, during which our 
reform program was submitted for discussion. This reform 
program was unanimously supported by the participants. 
  The most important change was the establishment of the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as the "boss," which 
can influence its subordinates with its power. It has the right 
and power to benefit from the assets, to make major decisions, 
and to select managerial personnel, but it does not interfere in 
the daily production and operations of its affiliated 
enterprises. The assets of its affiliated enterprises are 
formed with the corporation's investments, and these enterprises 
are responsible for ensuring the value of these assets and also 
their increments. Thus the relationship between the corporation 
and its affiliated enterprises has changed from one between 
"mother-in-law and daughter-in-law," which is of an 
administrative subordination nature, to one between "mother and 
son," which is characterized by the relationship between 
management and ownership. 
  [Mo] Does this change make enterprise leaders feel they have 
been "downgraded"? 
  [Yang] The separation of the owner from the operator is the 
demand of social productive forces' development. The positions 
of the owner and the operator must not be mistaken, as this 
could lead to confusion. Some of our enterprise leaders think 
they are the owner's representatives. This is a 
misunderstanding resulting from a confused idea about the 
relationship between management and ownership. As a matter of 
fact, a clear definition of enterprise roles, responsibilities, 
and rights will be more favorable for them in the performance of 
their duties and functions. 
  In the past, when a government 
department formed a company, it abolished the legal person's 
position of the enterprise affiliated with it. We do not do 
this. The mother company and the branch company are independent 
legal persons enjoying an equal position in civil rights. The 
branch company possesses the right to the legal person's assets 
formed with the investments of the asset dispenser, including 
the state. It carries out independent operations, assumes sole 
responsibility for its profits and losses, pays taxes according 
to regulations, and enjoys all the rights provided by Enterprise 
Law, the Regulations on the Transformation of State Enterprises' 
Operational Mechanisms, and Beijing's methods for implementing 
these regulations. Therefore many enterprises are of the 
opinion that we are not withdrawing powers from them, but are 
delegating powers to them. Comrades in these enterprises said 
jokingly: Evidently, "mother is more intimate to son" than 
"mother-in-law to daughter-in-law." 
  [Mo] How does the mother company manage the assets? 
  [Yang] First, it practices a new leadership system, which is 
the general manager responsibility system under the leadership 
of the board of directors. Second, it has established rules and 
regulations, such as the company's regulations, methods to 
operate and manage state assets, and methods to award or punish 
operators. Principal enterprise leaders will be awarded or 
punished according to the letter of responsibility for state 
asset operation and the contract of responsibility for target 
fulfillment, by referring to the increment rate, profit rate, 
and net turnover of state assets, as well as the fulfillment of 
other targets. In short, the previous practice of exercising 
management over enterprises to the neglect of state assets has 
been changed to the current practice of exercising management 
over state assets while relaxing control over enterprises. 
  In the next step, we will introduce graded authorization. 
Large group companies will be granted asset operational rights 
in light of their specific conditions so that they will be 
entitled to an asset dispenser's status, which will be favorable 
to asset invigoration in the group companies themselves. 
  "Through a thorough transformation, we can free ourselves 
from miscellaneous administrative affairs and concentrate on 
this entirely new field: Making an overall plan for further 
development of assets, optimization of resource distribtuion, 
and adjustment of the structure," Cui Zhian said excitedly. 
"The power of models is limitless. Now many enterprises and 
staff members in cities who cannot see their development 
prospects have asked us to `optimize their resource 
distribution' as soon as possible so they can learn from the 
match factory in revitalizing itself. 
  ("The new role" has come up to the stage. How does it 
actually perform? Where is its ignition point? Please read 
part three of these serial reports--"The Hongyun Company Builds 
a Bridge.")

staff reporter Fei Weiwei (6316 0251 0251): "Calmly Untying the 
Tight Knot--Reports on Comprehensive Reforms Carried Out by the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation (Fourth 
Installment)"-- first paragraph is editor's note] 
  [Text] Editor's Note: Under the macroscopic environment 
of the still-unsound social insurance system, the issue of 
assigning jobs for surplus personnel generally has become the 
biggest obstacle to in-depth enterprise reform. The third 
installment of these reports -- "Hongyun Company Builds the 
Bridge" -- gave an account of the role it has played as a 
starter in the reform of the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation. It was also this company that had offered the 
first expenses for the training of the corporation's surplus 
personnel, which has created a favorable "microclimate" for 
in-depth reform. This article will mainly brief readers on how 
the Beijing Match Plant, a breakthrough point of reform in the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, trained and diverted 
more than two-thirds of its staff and workers to work elsewhere. 
  Where lies the difficulty in revitalizing large and 
medium-sized state enterprises? The greatest difficulty lies in 
the inability to divert numerous surplus personnel to work in 
other units because enterprises find it very difficult to absorb 
these personnel by themselves and society also finds it 
difficult to bear the burden, as the social insurance system is 
still unsound. That is why people called this a "tight knot." 
  The Beijing Match Plant, with a staff of 868 people, was a 
subsidiary of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. 
It had only 60 people left when it reorganized and moved out of 
the urban district to continue its match production. The 
surplus personnel all were diverted to other units, but none of 
them lodged a complaint against the plant, appealed to the 
higher authorities for help, or created trouble. This great 
event -- and in Beijing Municipality, at that -- was handled 
very smoothly and without causing any disturbance. 
  How did they untie this "tight knot"? 
  Neither society nor enterprises were in a position to 
bear the burden of surplus personnel. Hence, the Beijing First 
Light Industrial Corporation created an independent intermediary 
organization to manage its work force -- an organization that 
takes on the responsibility for untying the "tight knot" from 
beginning to end. 
  As a matter of fact, the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation succeeded in discovering a starter -- the Hongyun 
Company -- for the development of state assets and comprehensive 
reform. Meanwhile, the issue of relocation and placement of 
labor resources also was resolved, and funds for establishing a 
compensatory unemployment insurance mechanism have been 
relatively sufficient. However, who will undertake the heavy 
responsibility of "diverting the staff and workers to work 
elsewhere"? 
  In fact, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has 
studied the solution of the increasingly serious problem of 
redundant personnel over the past few years. There were nearly 
80,000 staff and workers in the corporation. Even if the factor 
of industrial structure was not considered, the rate of surplus 
personnel still exceeded 30 percent. A few years ago, in order 
to invigorate the employment system, they optimized labor 
organization, which resulted in a reduction of 8,000 people from 
among the 80,000 staff and workers. For this reason, the 
corporation was at the forefront of the entire municipality in 
this respect. However, owing to the unsound insurance system, 
excessively scanty amount of unemployment compensation, and the 
inability of the untrained personnel to enter the market, most 
of the staff and workers returned to their original posts one 
after another, and a number of new contradictions were elicited 
accordingly. 
  "The diversion of staff and workers in state-owned 
enterprises should be resolved by way of a market mechanism, but 
should not wait until the perfect establishment of a labor 
market. Therefore, it calls for setting up an economic entity 
that will act as an intermediary for the development and 
placement of labor force in keeping with the market law." This 
is a consensus reached by the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation through assiduous exploration of the issue of 
diverting staff and workers to other jobs. Consequently, when 
the Hongyun Investment Company -- an asset development company 
-- was founded, expenses needed for the diversion of staff and 
workers were allotted from this company to set up an economic 
entity with independent assets: the Beijing Jingqing Labor 
Service Development Company. Its duties are as follows: 1) The 
management of staff and workers during the removal period to 
redevelop the assets of the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation; 2) The training of staff and workers to enhance 
their quality; and 3) The transition from a centralized job 
placement system to a new employment mechanism suited to the 
market economic structure through the integration of labor force 
employment system with labor insurance system, so as to achieve 
the objective of appropriately assigning jobs for staff and 
workers in society. 
  This labor force management intermediary 
organization took overall responsibility for unemployment 
insurance, training for job transference, and job assignment of 
the asset development enterprises [zi chan kai fa qi ye 6327 
3934 7030 4099 0120 2814], so that state-owned enterprises were 
able to perform the tasks of asset development "with light 
burdens." In this regard, we may say that it was the Beijing 
Jingqing Labor Service Development Company that untied the 
"tight knot." 
  The big pot has been broken, and everyone is longing for a 
new and fine bowl after being trained. People hope that those 
in work can have more pay for more work, that those who are our 
of work need not worry about their food and clothing, and that 
those who seek new jobs will also obtain benefits. They have 
something to wish for and have actually gained something. 
Thanks to these "two wheels," the diversion of staff and 
workers has progressed at a more rapid pace. 
  At the end of 1993 when the match plant, with a history of 
70 
years, was leveled to the ground amid the rumble of bulldozers, 
the staff and workers really could not calm their feelings. "I 
can do nothing but dip the heads of matches and package them, so 
I am incapable of finding a new job. What am I to live on in 
the future?" 
  Just a couple of months later, the once-agitated and 
disappointed hearts were overflowing with beautiful aspirations. 
Among the 868 staff and workers, some of the elderly ones 
retired ahead of time, others were transferred to work in a new 
factory, and it was arranged for the remaining 558 personnel to 
receive training for other posts. On the basis of full 
investigation and study, the Beijing Jingqing Labor Service 
Development Company has made training plans in line with the 
requirements of society and of management and service work for 
the small residential district built on the site of the original 
match plant. Here, the company started 14 training courses, 
including business accounting, computer science, enterprise 
business administration, commercial services, cooking, 
cosmetology, hair-dressing, gardening, driving, automobile 
maintenance, tailoring, and so on. After these people were 
released from work to receive training for three to 12 months, 
those who passed examinations were issued certificates 
certifying their qualifications for reemployment, their grades, 
and their standard equivalent to technical secondary school 
graduates. In this way, they were qualified to participate in 
the talent competition on the market, thereby achieving the 
ultimate goal of two-way selection between enterprises and 
individuals through training so that the superior ones were able 
to find new jobs. For this reason, staff and workers were 
extremely enthusiastic about attending training courses. Some 
said: "Reform did not kick us out and leave us alone. The 
state has spent money on our training, paid our basic salaries, 
and prepared us for re-employment. That is why we are most 
willing to learn, despite fatigue and hardships, because it is 
to our own benefit to learn the skills, is it not?" Some types 
of work -- like driving and hair-dressing -- require higher and 
special skills, so the trainees must pay for part of the 
expenses. They paid readily, without saying a word. 
  Without doubt, the opportunity to find an occupation again, 
the pressure of obtaining a job based on one's own 
qualifications and not by assignment, and the pursuit of a new 
profession are powerful driving forces for staff and workers to 
keep their minds diligently on their studies. In addition, the 
Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company also gave 
consideration to appropriate interest stimulation for the 
job-awaiting staff and workers, who live on their salaries, 
through the following measures: 1) The salaries of staff and 
workers who persist in production are higher than their original 
levels; 2) Salaries during training are lower than those 
received when they were at work; 3) The compensation given to 
personnel waiting for employment is larger than social 
compensation; 4) Sick and resigned personnel are given a 
lump-sum subsidy in an amount generally equivalent to one-third 
of their annual income; 5) Those who suspend work and pay while 
retaining their posts are granted a lump-sum subsidy, but should 
pay unified funds for old age and management fees for keeping 
files; and 6) Those who resign and will find jobs on their own 
are given subsidies equivalent to their salary income of two and 
a half years. Within two weeks of the announcement of these 
measures, four people asked for transfers, three resigned, and 
most of the students in the driver training course said they 
would try their best to find jobs by themselves after the 
training. 
  Overstaffing is not only a tough problem for asset 
development enterprises, but also one that state-owned 
enterprises wish very much to resolve. In-depth exploration is 
being carried out at a new level. 
  Although students in various training courses had not 
obtained their graduation certificates, recruitment units in 
society began to call on them, one after another. The 
restaurant service training class would finish its course by the 
end of April, but a unit told the students that it would come to 
recruit more than half of them at the end of March. The 
gardening class was in similar circumstances, as a unit readily 
announced the recruitment of half the students.... 
  However, personalities responsible for the Beijing Jingqing 
Labor Service Development Company did not dare to relax their 
efforts in the least. The aim of this company is to take care 
of the work to divert nearly 20,000 staff and workers in 32 
enterprises engaged in asset development or relocating to other 
places. Liang Jingao, general manager of the company, proposed 
an even higher goal: The Beijing Jingqing Labor Service 
Development Company ultimately should undertake the entire task 
of diverting all surplus personnel in the state-owned 
enterprises under the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation, so that all these enterprises can shake off their 
burdens and "march with light packs." 
  In light of the large numbers of surplus personnel 
prominently existing on the Chinese sides [xiao mu ti 1420 3018 
7555] of joint ventures at present, they have decided to start 
with this, by using for reference the practice of diverting 
personnel in enterprises that are relocating. According to this 
practice, a joint venture pays an amount in the form of 
compensation to a labor service company to discharge the 
expenses of training its surplus personnel so that they are 
capable of finding jobs again in the labor market. Recently, the 
Beijing Jingqing Labor Service Development Company began drawing 
up plans to train some 180 off-the-post staff and workers of a 
joint venture: The Convenient Foodstuff Factory.

7022 3932), and Zhu Jianhong (2612 0494 4767): "What Has 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation Told Us?--Reports on 
Comprehensive Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation (fifth and last installment)"--passages 
published in boldface contained in a box] 
  [Text] The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation 
experiences in enlivening state assets through carrying out 
comprehensive reforms have attracted the universal attention of 
society. A leader of a southern city sighed with regret because 
he had not known about the corporation earlier. At a recent 
meeting to exchange experience in points selected for 
experiments on comprehensive reforms in the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation, convened by the State Commission for 
Restructuring Economy, a representative expressed his feelings 
as follows: "A small match (meaning the case of the relocation 
of a match factory) has lit up the whole space around." 
  We heartily rejoice at such strong repercussions of the 
reforms in the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation 
because, in the course of making reports about the corporation, 
we indeed had the feeling of a soft breeze blowing toward us. 
However, because the enthusiasm to learn from the Beijing First 
Light Industrial Corporation is intensifying, we are worried 
that what is learned may be different from what is expected and 
that things which should not be stressed, may be stressed. 
  Our desire and responsibility is to help our readers 
correctly understand and grasp this typical example. 
  The focus of the reforms carried out by the Beijing 
First Light Industrial Corporation is not to enliven the 
enterprises but to enliven the assets. The corporation has 
pushed reforms a big step forward and such reforms mark the 
raising of the curtain of a new stage in the reforms of 
enterprises. 
  "If I were the boss, what I should consider at present would 
be how to enliven all the assets instead of how to save each 
individual enterprise," said Zhou Dali, deputy director of the 
State Commission for Restructuring Economy Distribution 
Department, at an informal discussion meeting. "How should we 
change the situation of three one-thirds in state enterprises? 
If we concentrate our efforts on saving each individual 
enterprise, all enterprises will be half dead. Assets must be 
current assets. This is an essential demand of the market 
economy. Some enterprises must survive while others must perish 
and the disposal of resources should be optimized in the course 
of readjusting the structure and layout. Only by enlivening 
state assets will it be possible to enliven the overall 
situation." 
  The shift of the focus from enlivening enterprises to 
enlivening assets is a new change and a new demand of reform of 
the economic structure. It is also something that makes the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation so prominent. Of 
course, this does not mean enlivening enterprises is 
unimportant. Enlivening enterprises is the foundation. How can 
we enliven assets without enlivening enterprises? However, 
enlivening assets is the goal. To attain this goal, some 
enterprises which should survive should be allowed to live on 
happily, while other enterprises which should perish should be 
allowed to die a "natural and unrestrained death [xiao sa si yi 
hui 3469 3155 2984 0001 2585]." 
  "Enlivening assets is different from enlivening 
enterprises," 
said Li Yuan, director of the State Commission of Restructuring 
Economy Distribution Department. "First of all, in enlivening 
enterprises, impetus is often required only once. Such impetus 
can be a policy, funds, or technology and if it can last three 
to five years, it will be good enough. However, the enlivening 
of assets needs a long-term effective mechanism and the 
formation of such a mechanism is based on the construction of 
systems. Second, the enlivening of assets needs comprehensive 
reforms. In the reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation for example, the solutions to the two 
major difficult problems regarding the sources of funds and the 
placement of surplus personnel must involve the reforms of 
various systems, such as the land use system, the personnel and 
labor system, the system for training staff members and workers, 
and the social security system. Third, since the reforms are 
comprehensive, a new role is needed. The person who plays this 
role should undertake responsibility for state assets and should 
be able to manage state assets with a free hand, in accordance 
with the laws of the market economy, in a bid to preserve their 
value. However, such a new role should be established through 
reforming the enterprise property rights system." 
  Bai Jinrong, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal 
Committee for Restructuring Economy said: "The existing 
enterprise systems cannot meet the demands of the market economy 
on enterprises--to become competitive main bodies which raise 
funds on their own, carry out construction and operation on 
their own, and assume sole responsibility for their profits and 
losses. Nor can they meet the needs of large-scale socialized 
production--assets to float and disposal of resources to be 
optimized. In carrying out reforms of enterprises in the past, 
we always focused our attention on the relationships of 
production. However, the universal significance of the reforms 
carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation 
lies in the new path it has explored for enlivening the state 
economy--the organic integration, through comprehensive reforms, 
of the readjustment of the production setup, the enterprise 
organizational setup, the layout of industries, the 
transformation of the old urban areas, and the development of 
the land resources with the reform of the enterprise property 
rights system, with the goal of establishing a modern enterprise 
system to realize the unity of the readjustment of the 
production relationships with the development of the productive 
forces. That is, the unity of reform and development, as we 
usually put it." 
  The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation shifted from 
the management of production and enterprises to the operation 
and management of state assets. Ever since then, the Beijing 
First Light Industrial Corporation has lost its original meaning 
and like "Yiqing" and "Fazhan," has become a code name for large 
enterprise groups with assets of several billion yuan. 
  If you agree with the above views, do you accept the 
following judgment? The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Committee put forward the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system and this enabled the reforms of enterprises in our 
country to enter a new stage. With the intensive work carried 
out for some time, the curtain of this new stage has been raised 
and the opera has started. 
  The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has been 
able to carry out operational activities to enliven state assets 
thanks to the reform of the enterprise property rights system. 
Through authorized management of state assets, the Beijing 
First Light Industrial Corporation has acquired the status of 
the representative of the proprietor of assets and, therefore, 
can handle affairs which a single production enterprise could 
not handle and which government departments should not 
handle. 
  Although there are different views on the comprehensive 
reforms of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, we 
hold that the sequence of ideas is very clear: The point of 
integration of deepening reforms in enterprises with the 
development of the productive forces is to enliven assets; in 
the market economy structure, enterprise actions should be 
dominant ones in enlivening assets; and we must reform the 
existing enterprise system, otherwise the property rights 
relationship will not be clear and enterprises will find it 
difficult to fulfill this task. 
  Cui Zhian, chairman of the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation board of directors, recalled the formulation of the 
train of thought on reforms, saying: "Our new exploration of 
reform began in 1991 and the train of thought was really 
formulated after Comrade Xiaoping made his remarks in the south 
in 1992. The remarks about being beneficial to promoting the 
productive forces, beneficial to reinforcing the comprehensive 
national strength of our socialist country, and beneficial to 
enhancing the living standards of the people have enlightened us 
a great deal and have become the ideological weapon for us to 
deepen reform. We conducted investigations and made analyses of 
our own position and discovered that we were in a very difficult 
situation. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation 
mainly produced daily necessities and any other enterprise could 
also do that. Besides, preferential policies were implemented 
for joint ventures, township and town enterprises, and open 
areas, but we were under the impact of contraband. We had no 
strong points at all. What was the way out? We summed up the 
experience of reforms carried out in some of our enterprises and 
our train of thought became clearer. In the past, the 
consumption rate of the No. 3 Glass Plant was great and its 
products were of lower grade. After it was moved to Daxing 
County and became a joint venture, it introduced advanced 
technology and produced high-grade glass products. The price 
for each tonne of glass products rose from 1,200 yuan to 8,000 
yuan. Then came the lighting device plant which had been a 
loss-making plant for many years. After it used the building of 
a branch plant to do business, it was able to give jobs to over 
100 surplus personnel and to bring in an additional income of 3 
million yuan. It was most profitable to develop tertiary 
industry in prosperous areas and everybody was able to see that. 
The idea of relocating secondary industry enterprises and 
developing tertiary industry enterprises, and of moving 
production factors out of the Fourth Ring Road to develop 
secondary industry at a high level was put forward on this basis. 
  "At present, state enterprises commonly face three 
difficulties: Funds are in short supply, personnel are 
excessive, and assets cannot be enlivened," said Cui Zhian. 
"Viewed from the reality of the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation, the last of the three difficulties was the crux and 
once this knot was untied, the other difficulties could be 
overcome. Once the assets were enlivened, there would be money 
and more jobs could be provided for the surplus personnel. How 
could this knot be untied? We must have the right to operate 
assets. To whom should the rights to operate assets be given? 
Should they be given to a certain production enterprise? Given 
the difficult situation the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation was in, it would not make things any better no 
matter which production enterprise was given the right to 
operate assets. Should such rights be given to government 
departments? But government departments cannot take part in 
operational activities. What should we do then? The only thing 
for us to do was to change ourselves and shoulder the task." 
  "Unclear property rights relationships are the root cause of 
the poor operation of state enterprises," said Li Yuan. "To 
solve this problem, the idea of separating the two rights, that 
is, separating ownership rights from the rights of operation, 
was once put forward in carrying out reforms in the past. This 
played a great role in ensuring the right to make decisions on 
the operation of enterprises. However, since the state was the 
proprietor and the enterprises were operators, it was still 
difficult to separate the government from enterprises. The crux 
of the problem was to find an appropriate position for the 
proprietor in enterprises. Through authorized rights to operate 
state assets, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation 
acquired the status as the representative of the proprietor. 
This shows that separating government from assets is an 
important condition for separating government from enterprises." 
  To enliven assets, we must establish a property rights main 
body. The ultimate ownership of state assets belongs to the 
state and enterprises only have legal person property rights. 
Who then should exercise ownership of assets on behalf of the 
state and undertake the responsibility of preserving and 
increasing the value of such assets? The Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation has provided us with a train of thought. 
  The reforms by the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation have both universal and special significance. The 
reforms by the corporation have been carried out on the basis of 
its own reality. In learning from the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation, we should also proceed from our 
respective realities. 
  There are two direct reasons for the success in the reforms 
of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation: The right to 
operate state assets and the right to develop land resources. 
However, these two cannot be equated with the reform of the 
property rights system and the construction of the modern 
enterprise system. 
  The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation has found its 
own position in reform. It has changed from an organization for 
the management of a trade into a company of an enterprise nature 
for the operation of state assets. "Can we also do the same?" 
This is perhaps the most directly associated thought in some 
administrative departments. 
  Speaking about this question, Li Yuan said, "Where this new 
role can be played should be based on the characteristics of the 
respective specific situations and productive forces. In a big 
city like Beijing, for example, if such a role is played at a 
level higher than the original specialized administrative 
department, the range of administration will be too wide. In a 
small city, it is perhaps more appropriate for one or two 
companies to play this role. Another idea is for the role to be 
played by a single production enterprise but this has to be 
determined by the scale and capacity of that enterprise. In the 
Beijing light industry system, if the role is played by a 
certain production enterprise, that enterprise can be enlivened. 
However, the role of enlivening state assets of the entire 
system will be greatly reduced." 
  "What is more important," stressed Li Yuan, "is to select 
the 
player of this `new role.' We must take into consideration its 
quality and ability, including its sense of reform, its 
comprehensive ability, and its operational capacity. Before it 
was authorized to operate state assets, the leadership of the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation had already made 
numerous attempts at reform. Under difficult conditions, it 
constantly optimized the disposal of the production factors and 
achieved initial results and valuable experience. Therefore, if 
we want to follow its example we should act in the same way and 
learn from them properly." 
  Whenever comrades of the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation talk about the reforms they carried out, they never 
forget the support of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and 
Municipal Government and the guidance from the State Commission 
for Restructuring Economy. In fact, the reforms in the Beijing 
First Light Industrial Corporation have been carried out ahead 
of time. It is precisely because of this that some practices are 
not completely in keeping with certain existing rules, 
regulations, and policies. The Beijing CPC Municipal CPC 
Committee and Municipal Government, from the angle of carrying 
out experiments boldly, have given special treatment to the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. The right to 
comprehensively develop real estate within the system, for 
example, has been granted specially. 
  According to a comrade from the Beijing Municipal Committee 
for Restructuring Economy, land is a state asset. The use of 
land has to be compensated and has a time limit. The 
responsibility for land management is undertaken by special 
government departments and specific work is carried out by local 
governments. Taxes and fees collected are used for urban 
construction. The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation 
has changed the purpose in using land. According to regulations, 
the land should be taken back, new applications should be 
submitted for examination and approval, and taxes and fees 
concerned should be paid. In this respect, there is no 
exception for the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. 
However, the municipal government has adopted some relatively 
lax policies and flexible practices in the relocation of 
enterprises. For example, the amount of money to be handed over 
to the state for the sale of land can be handed over by 
installments and part of the money can be returned to the 
enterprises as reinvestment by the state. In redeveloping the 
land originally occupied by the Beijing Match Plant, the land 
was converted into 47 million state shares in the Hongyun 
Company. At present, the value of this part of the state assets 
has increased by 200 percent. In this way, the reforms of the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation acquired the 
necessary means and funds for the start. Therefore, in this 
sense, it can be said that the attempt to reform the system of 
using land has benefited the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation and the credit should go to the municipal 
government. This is precisely a concrete action of "supporting 
reform with reform" put forward by the Beijing Municipality. 
  Li Yuan holds that the reform of the land use system 
centering round the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation 
carried out by the Beijing Municipality can meet the needs of 
the market economy and has not changed the nature whereby land 
belongs to the state. Compared with various practices of using 
land to attract foreign capital in some localities and giving 
preferential treatment to foreign businessmen and allowing them 
to have more profits, the method adopted by the Beijing 
Municipality is more normal. The merit of this practice is that 
it has demonstrated the value of land assets and has prevented 
the loss of land assets. However, the land use system is an 
important state system and we should safeguard its solemnity and 
authority. Reforms must be carried out in an orderly way, step 
by step, and under the guidance of the government departments 
concerned. 
  We should not just focus our attention on land in optimizing 
the disposal of resources but should also pay attention to 
management, technology, equipment, qualified personnel, and the 
ways of combining various production factors. In Beijing, 
because differential land rent exists, land resources are very 
important. This may not be so in other localities. The reforms 
of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation have been 
carried out on the basis of its reality. In learning from the 
corporation, we should also proceed from our respective 
realities.

<F P=106> [Article by the Ministry of Agriculture Rural Economic </F>
Research Center edited by Lin Li (2651 4539): "Problems and 
Strategic Changes in China's Rural Economic Development"] 
  [Text]I. The Main Current Problems in Rural Economic 
Development 
  1.01 Since the late 1980's, the deep-seated contradictions 
and problems which had long existed in China's rural economic 
development, gradually emerged. These contradictions and 
problems are mainly reflected in the sluggish growth of 
peasants' income in recent years. Since the beginning of 1992, 
given a new period of speedy growth in the national economy and 
an unprecedented thriving market economy, the sluggish growth of 
peasants' income has not changed. On the contrary, this has 
made the various new circumstances and new problems which are 
unfavorable to agriculture and peasants salient and once again 
is drawing people's great attention. These problems include: 
The continuous deterioration of trading conditions for 
agriculture, the issue of IOU's for the purchase of farm 
products, the outflow of agricultural funds, the holding up of 
farmlands by development zones, and the added burden on 
peasants. In the meantime, given the further removal of price 
controls on farm products and the conditions of a market 
economy, the questions of whether or not there is a need to 
protect agriculture and how to protect it have become new hot 
topics in policy research. All these problems, which have 
occurred as China changes to a market economic system, seem to 
imply that the development of China's agriculture and rural 
economy has entered a crucial period of change. 
  The Importance of Achieving Growth in Peasant 
Incomes 
  1.02 Compared with that at the previous stage, the growth of 
the rural economy during the 1989-1992 period had some totally 
different characteristics, namely that the growth in peasant 
incomes basically stagnated despite the fact that the supply of 
farm products picked up. Between 1989 and 1991, excluding the 
price factor, the per capita net income of peasants across the 
country only grew by 0.7 percent. Together with the 5.9 percent 
in rehabilitation growth in 1992, the average growth rate during 
the four years was only 1.88 percent. During the same period, 
calculated at constant prices, the total agricultural output 
value had an annual average increase of 5.1 percent and grain 
saw an increase of 2.9 percent; other major farm products, 
except cotton whose production decreased in 1992 as a result of 
insect disasters and which only had an average annual growth of 
2.2 percent, such as oil-bearing crops, sugar-bearing crops, 
meats, fruits, vegetables, and aquatic products had increases 
ranging from 6 to 10 percent. The increased output of farm 
products unaccompanied by a growth in peasant incomes, by little 
growth, or even by negative growth in certain years, has been 
seldom seen since reform and since the PRC was founded. 
  1.03 Another phenomenon which attracts the same attention as 
the excessively slow growth in peasant incomes is the 
continuously widening income gaps between the cities and the 
countryside and between different regions. For eight years 
running since 1985, the income of urban residents grew much 
quicker than that of peasants. Between 1989 and 1992, the annual 
growth calculated by actual incomes showed that cities were 5 
percentage points higher than the countryside. This has once 
again widened the income gap between cities and the countryside 
which had been narrowing for some time since reform. In 1978, 
the ratio between peasants' per capita net income and urban 
residents' per capita living expenditure income was 1:2.37. In 
1984, it narrowed to 1:1.71, and in 1992, it widened again to 
1:2.33. The gap has returned to the pre-reform level. 
  1.04 The income gap between peasants in different regions 
has also increased very obviously. In 1992, the ratio between 
peasants in the west, central, and eastern regions was 
100:115:166 and the highest-income province (Shanghai) had 
income 4.49 times higher than the lowest-income province 
(Gansu). In 1983, the figures were 100:126:144 and 2.69 times 
respectively. During the period of slow growth in peasant 
incomes between 1989 and 1992, the annual growth in peasant 
incomes in the eastern region was 2.29 percent and that in 
central and the western regions 1.44 and 1.27 percent 
respectively. This shows that the income gap between peasants 
in different regions still tends to widen continuously and that 
the growth in peasant incomes in many regions has stagnated or 
even decreased in recent years. 
  1.05 The slow growth in peasant incomes not only directly 
affects the upgrading of peasants' quality of life and 
agricultural reinvestment but also has a negative influence on 
the growth of the entire national economy. In the three years 
between 1989 and 1991, the actual per capita living expenditure 
of peasants across the country only increased by 0.07 yuan each 
year. We can see from this that in many regions, peasants' 
living standards virtually have not improved and the so-called 
added burden on peasants is related to this. During the same 
period, peasants' per capita expenditure on the purchase of 
productive fixed assets (excluding the price factor) decreased 
by 22.2, 35.4, and 18.2 percent from 1988. Peasants' 
expenditure on purchasing chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and 
sheets of plastic film in recent years have also decreased and 
this will have an adverse and sluggish influence on agricultural 
production. 
  1.06 It is also necessary to point out that peasant incomes 
are becoming an increasingly important variable in the flowing 
course of the national economy. As the degree of 
commercialization and monetization of the rural economy is 
continuing to rise, the proportion of money income in peasant 
incomes has risen from 40 percent in the pre-reform period to 
nearly 70 percent at the present time. This means that an 
increase or decrease of one percentage point in peasant incomes 
has a much greater influence on the demand expansion of the 
national economy than in the past. Due to the sluggish growth 
in peasant incomes, in 1992, the proportion of rural retail 
sales volume in the total volume of retail sales decreased by 
5.5 percentage points from 1984 and by 3.1 percentage points 
from 1988. In the four years, peasants refrained from 
purchasing 82 billion yuan's worth of commodities and this is 
one of the main reasons why the home market has been sluggish 
during the past few years. 
  1.07 For a long time, due to the absolute short supply 
of farm products, the guiding principle in formulating rural 
policy was always to give priority to ensuring the supply goal 
of farm products. However, following the radical changes in the 
supply-demand pattern of farm products in the mid-1980's, the 
growth of agricultural production no longer simply corresponded 
to the growth in peasant incomes and the importance in peasant 
incomes as a motivation for growth had greatly increased. 
Furthermore, at the microscopic level, since reform, peasants 
can expand supply only on the premise of increasing income and, 
if the peasant incomes are as bad as expected, the government 
will find it very difficult to achieve the supply goal. 
Therefore, like maintaining the growth of a balanced 
supply-demand structure for farm products, maintaining the 
sustained growth in peasant incomes should become the basic goal 
for the formulation of China's agricultural and rural policies 
in the 1990's. 
  The Main Factors Restricting Growth in Peasant 
Incomes 
  1.08 It is generally held that two factors have resulted in 
the sluggish growth in peasant incomes since 1989. First, the 
trading conditions for agriculture have worsened. Compared with 
1988, the price index of farm products rose by 10.87 percent in 
1992 (prices on the grain market have fallen since 1989, 
reaching their nadir in October 1992), whereas the price index 
of agricultural capital goods rose by 33.59 percent. Second, 
during the period of economic rationalization, the speedy growth 
of township and town enterprises was curbed. Between 1989 and 
1991, peasant incomes from nonagricultural sources fell by 25 
percentage points from the previous years, the percentage 
basically remaining at the 1988 level. 
  1.09 However, a deeper analysis shows that in addition to 
the unfavorable factors, which are caused by the abovementioned 
short-term policies, there are deep-seated reasons for the 
sluggish growth in peasant incomes in recent years. In order to 
demonstrate this, we can compare the changes in the main sources 
of peasant income growth at different stages since 1978. The 
speediest growth in peasant incomes was in the 1978-1984 period 
when the actual average per capita income growth was 15.1 
percent annually. The same period also saw farm products having 
their speediest growth, an average annual growth of 6.5 percent. 
At this stage, the growth in peasant incomes mainly benefited 
from the supernormal growth in farm products in the early years 
of reform and iis characteristics were that agricultural 
production increased as did peasant incomes. At the second 
stage, namely between 1985 and 1988, despite the fact that the 
growth rate of agriculture lowered to 4.1 percent, peasants' per 
capita actual income retained an annual growth rate of 5 
percent. The main reason for this was that township and town 
enterprises began to emerge during this period and income from 
nonagricultural sectors supported the continuous growth in 
peasant incomes. The characteristics of this stage can be 
summed up as the slowing down of agricultural growth and the 
continuous growth in peasant incomes. However, during the 
1989-1992 period, the growth rate of agriculture rose to 5.1 
percent but the actual per capita income of peasants only grew 
by 2 percent, representing an increase in agricultural 
production unaccompanied by an increase in peasant incomes. 
This "increase in output unaccompanied by an increase in 
income" in fact means that the major motivating factors which 
had supported the sustained growth in peasant incomes in the 
first two stages, namely the growth patterns in agriculture and 
in township and town enterprises, have already undergone some 
phased change. In fact, as the analysis given below shows, the 
real challenges we are faced with are that the previous growth 
pattern of the rural economy has difficulty in supporting the 
sustained growth in peasant incomes and that, if radical 
readjustment measures are lacking, then the sluggish growth in 
peasant incomes in recent years will probably become a long-term 
tendency. Below, we are going to analyze the major phased 
changes facing rural economic development. 
  1.10 First, there have been profound changes in the supply 
pattern of farm products and in the form of agricultural growth. 
Prior to reform, China had been short of farm product supplies 
for a long time. The speedy growth of agriculture motivated by 
rural reform reversed this situation in just a few years. In 
approximately the mid-1980's, China's farm-product supply 
pattern began to radically change. This was first reflected in 
the changes in the consumption level and consumption structure 
of urban and rural residents. Following the improvement in the 
supply of foodstuffs, in 1983, the per capita daily calorie 
intake from food by peasants in China exceeded 2,400 
kilocalories for the first time. In the mid-1980's, the daily 
calorie intake from food by urban and rural residents had 
already reached 2,900 kilocalories. After urban and rural 
residents steadily passed the point of simply having enough food 
and clothing, Engel's Coefficient began to steadily lower, the 
per capita direct consumption of grain by urban and rural 
residents began to fall in 1986 in absolute terms, and food 
consumption began to change from an increase in quantity to the 
upgrading of the quality structure. Second, following the 
change of the consumption structure, agricultural growth began 
to feel the restriction of demand and the income elasticity of 
major farm products began to decrease. 
  According to 
estimates by relevant experts, comparing the 1985-1992 period 
and the 1979-1984 period, the income elasticity of grain fell 
from 0.63 to -0.15, that of oil-bearing crops fell from 2.94 to 
0.49, that of pork from 1.34 to 0.53, that of poultry from 3.06 
to 0.75, that of sugar-bearing crops from 0.94 to 0.09, and only 
the income elasticity of aquatic products rose from 0.52 to 
0.86, that of eggs basically remained the same, and that of 
cloth fell from 0.76 to zero. Since the mid-1980's, it has been 
difficult to sell farm products. Although China's per capita 
grain output in the 1990-1991 period was basically the same as 
in the 1983-1984 period, prices on the grain market fell 
considerably and grain did not sell easily, a clear sign that 
agricultural growth was restricted by demand. The change from 
the restriction of supply to the restriction of demand or, 
rather, from mainly aggregate contradictions to structural 
contradictions is a historical change in China's farm products 
supply-demand structure. This change began in the mid-1980's 
and will play a role for a long time in future agricultural 
growth. Precisely because of the motivation of the change in 
this pattern, China's agricultural growth pattern will change 
from the previous pure quantity-type growth to a type of growth 
stressing both quantity and quality. 
  1.11 The restriction of demand is not all bad. Rather, it 
makes it possible to use market mechanisms to effectively 
allocate resources. However, what we have to say here is that 
the sluggish growth in peasant incomes in recent years, and the 
prospects for peasant income growth in the future, are directly 
bound up with the changes in this pattern. First, given the 
short supply of farm products in the early years of reform, the 
"sponge effect," namely where an increase in supply is 
immediately swallowed by demand, no longer exists. This means 
that the growth in peasant incomes no longer simply corresponds 
to the growth in agricultural output. Second, given the 
existence of the restrictions of demand, if the supply structure 
of farm products does not adjust to the changes in their demand 
structure, it also means that an increase in output is not 
accompanied by an increase in income. In fact, the readjustment 
of China's agricultural production structure already lags behind 
the changes in the supply-demand pattern. This is reflected by 
the very salient structural contradictions in the supply-demand 
structure in recent years. Third, once China officially rejoins 
GATT as a member, the pressure from external competition will 
increase and this also means that it will be much more difficult 
to support peasant incomes with agricultural growth. Lastly, if 
the course of agricultural transformation is not accompanied by 
technological progress, the effect of decreasing marginal 
returns from agricultural investment will occur conspicuously 
and peasants' efforts to increase income will be partially 
invalidated by the accelerated increase in agricultural costs. 
  1.12 Therefore, we have come to the viewpoint that the 
characteristics of great phased changes have already begun to 
appear in China's agricultural development and this is a token 
that agricultural development is stepping into a new period. We 
can conclude from this that if we are unable to effectively 
promote structural reform, it is already impossible for the 
current structural framework of agriculture to sustain a 
continuous fast growth rate in peasant incomes, although 
peasants derive 60 to 70 percent of their income from 
agriculture at the present time. 
  1.13 We are now going to analyze the profound changes facing 
the development of township and town enterprises. As for the 
question of increasing peasant incomes, people set more hope on 
township and town enterprises. As the great invention by 
Chinese peasants in the 1980's, township and town enterprises 
really play a vital role in opening employment channels for 
peasants and increasing their income. The development of 
township and town enterprises in recent years has been not slow. 
In 1992, their total output value reached 1,700 billion yuan, 
of which 1,300 billion was in industrial output value and 
represented more than one-third of China's total industrial 
output value. However, since the late 1980's, the tendency has 
obviously appeared in the development of township and town 
enterprises that their capital is becoming increasingly 
intensive and their ability to employ labor has weakened. The 
output value of township and town enterprises in 1992 doubled 
that of 1988, while the number of their employees only increased 
by 10.9 percent, showing a decrease in employment elasticity 
from 0.35 to 0.13. Since 1988, the fixed assets of collective 
enterprises at the township and village levels have increased by 
an annual average of 18.4 percent, while the number of employees 
hired per 10,000 yuan of assets decreased from 3.1 in 1988 to 
1.8 in 1991. Between 1984 and 1988, township and town 
enterprises employed 12.6 million people from the agricultural 
sector, while only an annual average of 2.6 million were 
employed during the 1989-1992 period, representing a fraction of 
that during the former period. 
  1.14 There will be an annual increase in surplus manpower by 
over 10 million people in China's rural areas in the future. 
The question of how to dissolve this huge unemployment pressure 
and fully utilize and develop these rich labor resources is the 
most challenging one for rural development in the 1990's. The 
problem now is that the manpower not absorbed by agriculture 
cannot be absorbed by township and town enterprises, which we 
have always considered the best Chinese-style way to resolve 
unemployment in rural areas! Does this indicate that there is a 
need to reassess our previous understanding all over again? 
  1.15 In fact, some recent analyses have already pointed out 
the inherent weaknesses in the structure and composition of 
township and town enterprises. The following are the two major 
weaknesses: First, township and town enterprises are extremely 
scattered and are not in step with urbanization, so they are 
unable to effectively nurture the development of tertiary 
industry and this in turn leads to the unbalanced development of 
secondary and tertiary industries among township and town 
enterprises. This is an important point which restricts 
township and town enterprises from expanding employment. 
Second, the community-based nature of township and town 
enterprises restricts the flow of production elements and, 
coupled with other factors, leads to the distortion of the 
prices of production elements, thus causing the township and 
town enterprises in some developed regions to "replace labor 
with capital" too soon. 
  1.16 We have come to the view that the contradictions 
covered up in the early years of the development of China's 
township and town enterprises are being gradually exposed. This 
means that, like agriculture, township and town enterprises are 
also faced with major phased changes in their further 
development. From this, we have come to the conclusion that if 
we fail to effectively readjust the strategy for township and 
town enterprises, the present pattern can no longer effectively 
resolve the unemployment problem in rural areas nor can it 
continue to support the comparatively quick growth in peasant 
incomes. 
  Price Protection and Structural Readjustment 
  1.17 According to estimates by the quarters concerned, in 
order for peasants to lead a comparatively comfortable life by 
the end of this century, their per capita net income should 
reach 1,200 yuan (at 1990 prices) which requires that peasant 
incomes increase at an annual rate of 6.3 percent from 1993 
onward. Obviously, under the restrictive conditions mentioned 
previously, it is very difficult to achieve this goal. In other 
words, in order to promote the continuous growth in peasant 
incomes for a period of time to come, it is necessary to make a 
policy choice about opening up new sources of income. In 
discussions in recent years, various different views have 
gradually concentrated on a choice between two policies: The 
first is that we should adopt a price protection policy for 
major farm products and the second is that we should formulate 
and adopt a new policy which promotes structural readjustment. 
  1.18 The price protection policy we are talking about here 
is whereby, after controls on grain prices have been lifted, the 
state should fix minimum protective prices for grain purchases 
to stabilize grain production and simultaneously increase 
peasant incomes. Most people agree with this policy proposal 
but some disagree and have raised several questions worthy of 
further discussion. The first is the question of whether or not 
we are able to grant subsidies. They maintain that financial 
subsidies are needed to form a price higher than the market 
price; that if the protective price is inappropriate, its 
protective role does not work; and that if the protective price 
is too high, the financial burden will be very heavy. In 
adopting price protection policies, North America, the EC, 
Japan, and Taiwan each have only a small agricultural population 
which is approximately 20 percent of the total population. That 
is to say, the majority subsidizes the minority. China's 
present agricultural population accounts for 70 percent or more 
of the total and, in these circumstances, it is very difficult 
to pursue a price protection policy. The second question is 
that of efficiency. The price protection policy inevitably 
causes price distortions and leads to the loss of efficiency in 
resources allocation. In this respect, developed countries have 
also drawn a lesson. While creating a huge burden, subsidies 
also lead to a great surplus of farm products and an excess 
waste of resources. Moreover, given the serious unemployment 
situation in China's rural areas, the interests of the price 
protection policy will be shared by the large rural population 
and will in fact increase the cost of shifting rural manpower 
from the agricultural sector and will, in turn, cost us the 
opportunity for structural readjustment. In addition, there is 
the problem that agricultural costs chase prices, namely the 
"return of price parity." In short, before adopting the price 
protection policy, we need to consider various factors and weigh 
all advantages and disadvantages. Our basic view is that it is, 
after all, necessary to pursue the protective price system at 
the present stage. We should at least ensure that peasants do 
not make a loss from growing grain crops. This is also out of 
consideration for the country's grain security. However, we must 
know that this policy is very limited in resolving the problem 
of peasant incomes and that it is very unrealistic if we set all 
our hopes of increasing peasant incomes on protective prices in 
the future. 
  1.19 In our opinion, it is a more practical and positive 
idea to seek and open up new sources for increasing peasant 
incomes in the future through adopting a new policy or measure 
which promotes structural readjustment and through promoting the 
further reform of the rural industrial structure. The 
structural readjustment we are talking about here not only 
includes the readjustment of the agricultural structure and the 
internal industrial structure of rural areas but also the 
readjustment of economic structure between cities and the 
countryside. It not only means readjusting the industrial 
structure but, more fundamentally, changing the current 
employment structure through the readjustment of the industrial 
structure so that the free flow, rational combination, and 
optimum allocation of all production elements and resources 
within a greater scope can be achieved. In light of the 
inherent demand of rural economic development and of past 
experiences, the main points of the new policy which can promote 
structural readjustment are: We must not limit it to rural 
areas but should carry it out in both cities and the 
countryside. We should combine the internal structural 
readjustment of rural areas with the drive for urbanization and 
pursue a new round of structural reforms with urbanization as 
the central issue. We must intrtoduce more extensively market 
mechanisms and let price mechanisms play a better role in 
regulating the allocation of resources. We must pay more 
attention to the promotion of advanced and practical farming 
technology and support the efficiency of structural readjustment 
with technology. We must insist on making innovations in the 
organizational system to seek and establish the new 
organizational form and order of the future mobile society. In 
short, in our opinion, structural readjustment is a major force 
promoting economic development and China's rural development 
which takes structural reforms as the central issue has totally 
different characteristics from the past and richer contents. 
  II. Create a Macropolicy Environment Which Suits 
Structural Readjustment 
  2.01 The rural industrial structure in the 1980's was 
basically readjusted in the rural areas themselves and under the 
condition of not changing the original urban and rural economic 
patterns. Whether the readjustment of the crop-farming and 
agricultural structures in the early years, or the rise of 
township and town enterprises which came afterward, the basic 
focus of the policy is to resolve the problems in the rural 
areas themselves. Such being the case, the readjustment of the 
industrial structure in rural areas is still often restricted by 
the macropolicy environment. As we said earlier, the question 
remains: Is it okay to limit structural readjustment to rural 
areas themselves? This involves one fundamental point, namely, 
whether or not there is the need to readjust the traditional 
economic development strategy and its policy environment and 
whether or not we have come to the time for the readjustment and 
how to readjust it. In fact, discussions and arguments by the 
relevant quarters over this question have continued since rural 
reform but it was not until recently that this question was put 
on the agenda for policymaking. 
  The Necessity To Readjust the Traditional Development 
Strategy 
  2.02 For a long time, the strategy for developing the 
national economy has been that the development of heavy industry 
takes precedence over others. This form of traditional 
development strategy is of historical necessity. In the early 
years of the PRC, and under the prevailing international 
environment, the most important task was to build as quickly as 
possible a complete industrial system with heavy industry as the 
pillar. As the task was put forward, it was first necessary to 
solve the problem of primitive accumulation for 
industrialization. Obviously, under the prevailing historical 
conditions, in order to complete the task of primitive 
accumulation, it was impossible to rely on China's own weak 
light industry, still less on international aid, but on 
agriculture and rural areas. Therefore, in the process of 
national industrialization which followed, we gradually formed a 
whole set of macropolicy environment and economic management 
systems suited to this strategy, which gave priority to the 
development of heavy industry and special accumulative 
mechanisms. 
  2.03 For various historical reasons, in order to extract 
accumulations from agriculture and the rural areas and convert 
them into capital for industrialization, our specific practice 
was to adopt the system of state monopoly for the purchasing and 
marketing of farm products. Under this system, we lowered the 
cost of industrial raw materials and the wage costs through the 
monopoly purchase of farm products at low prices and acquired an 
excess profit through raising the prices of industrial 
manufactured goods. This excess profit kept changing into funds 
for industrialization through financial means. According to 
expert analyses and calculations, from 1952 to 1978, owing to 
the exchange of industrial and agricultural products at unequal 
prices, the funds flowing from agriculture to industry amounted 
to 391.7 billion yuan and the funds diverted from revenue income 
sources to industry totaled 93.5 billion yuan giving an overall 
value of 485.2 billion yuan. After deducting the financial 
returns to agriculture, the net flow of funds from agriculture 
came to 312 billion yuan, equivalent to 73.2 percent of the 
original value of the nonagricultural fixed assets of 
state-owned enterprises during the same period. 
  2.04 In order to guarantee the realization of this special 
accumulative mechanism, a policy environment and structural 
conditions which matched it were needed. This was mainly 
reflected in the following three aspects. The first was the 
artificially distorted prices of products and production 
elements. Given an extreme shortage of capital, in order to 
quickly develop capital- intensive industries, the state adopted 
the policy of: Suppressing the prices of farm products and raw 
materials, wages, and the prices of daily necessities and labor 
services; maintaining low interest rates and exchange rates; and 
raising the prices of industrial manufactured goods, thus 
maximizing the industrial profit rate and accumulative 
capability. Second, given the price distortions, it was 
necessary to allocate resources through a highly centralized 
planned system and administrative means and to strictly limit 
the free exchange of products and the free flow of production 
elements. In order to suppress the prices of farm products in 
rural areas, market prices and the market were eliminated 
altogether. In order to keep the opportunity cost of 
agricultural labor low and to control the scope and 
effectiveness of low-price welfare distribution in cities, China 
adopted a strict identity and household management system and 
firmly bound peasants to their land through a strict 
city-countryside segregation system, excluding them from the 
process of industrialization and urbanization. The third was to 
establish a microfoundation which suited the planned management 
structure. In rural areas, China instituted a people's 
commune-based collective economic system, integrated government 
administration with commune management, and deprived peasants of 
their decisionmaking power to ensure that agricultural 
production and management were placed under the government's 
direct intervention. In the cities, China built an economy with 
state ownership and state management as the mainstay, in which 
the government exercised planned management of enterprises and 
enterprises were merely production and labor units. 
  2.05 The traditional development strategy relied on the 
accumulations of rural areas and on the government's very strong 
capability to mobilize resources. This enabled China to 
basically establish a comparatively complete industrial system 
within a fairly short time. Its historical contributions and 
positive significance deserve affirmation. However, after the 
industrial system was basically established, following the 
diversified and specialized development of materials production 
departments and the increasingly complex national economic life, 
the weaknesses in the original structure and policy environment 
became increasingly obvious. In this process, although the goal 
of the strategy whereby the development of heavy industry took 
precedence over others was revised to some degree, its structure 
and policy environment remained basically unchanged. The 
microscopic low efficiency and the waste of macroscopic 
resources allocation seriously hindered the normal development 
of the national economy. In particular, under this traditional 
strategy, agricultural productive forces remained stagnant as a 
result of a long-term inability to make accumulations and a high 
degree of tension developed between the population and the land 
as large numbers of the rural population and work force were 
unable to shift smoothly in keeping with the industrialization 
process. All this shows that the traditional development 
strategy and its policy and structure could no longer be 
continued and had to be radically changed. It is not difficult 
to understand why rural reform unexpectedly took the lead when 
this kind of readjustment began. 
  2.06 The point is that, after 15 years of rural reform, 
extremely profound changes have occurred in the rural economy 
and its microscopic operational mechanisms, whereas the 
macropolicy environment, though having been relaxed, has not 
been radically changed. This is first reflected by the 
relationship between industry and agriculture and the 
distribution of national income. To date, the pattern of 
supporting industry with agricultural accumulations has not been 
radically reversed. In the process of industrialization, 
countries around the world have to have agriculture nurture 
industry. However, general experience shows that the nurturing 
time cannot be too long, otherwise a huge cost has to be paid. 
China's past experience has already explained this. Under the 
new condition of extensively introducing market mechanisms, the 
government should and must adopt a necessary support policy and 
protective measures for agriculture, which is a special sector, 
otherwise history will repeat itself. 
  2.07 More importantly, the current macropolicy environment 
already seriously hinders the development of the rural economy 
and its change into a market structure and has become a 
difficult point in reform. As we have said previously, in order 
to guarantee the further growth of agriculture, the rural 
economy, and peasants' income, we must launch a new structural 
readjustment and this demands market mechanisms play a fuller 
role so that production elements can freely flow and recombine 
within a greater scope. However, in the macropolicy environment, 
the distorted prices of products and production elements, the 
administrative intervention which is sometimes strict and 
sometimes loose, and the various manmade limitations on the flow 
of production elements hinder the normal growth of the products 
market and the production elements market and are becoming major 
limitations to the further development of the rural economy. In 
rural areas, this is mainly reflected in the planned purchase 
and marketing system which has not been thoroughly abolished and 
the city-countryside segregation system. In addition, this 
distorted macropolicy environment has led to the excessive 
number of frictions and contradictions in the process of 
changing the structure. This is because reform has created a 
new market-oriented mainstay of operations [jing ying zhu ti 
4842 3602 0031 7555]. On the other hand, because the 
macropolicy environment which conforms to the form of the 
previous development strategy has not been changed accordingly, 
the two inevitably have acute frictions and contradictions, 
leading to special difficulties during the period of changing 
the structure. Therefore, it is high time the traditional 
development strategy and its macropolicy environment are changed. 
  Smash the Key Links of the Old Economic Pattern 
  2.08 According to the experiences in countries and regions 
whose economies have developed in a sustained and speedy way 
since World War II, the development strategy which increases the 
speed and stability of economic development and possesses 
inherent structure-optimizing mechanisms is a one with a 
comparative advantage. By a strategy with a comparative 
advantage, we mean that we confirm an industrial structure in 
keeping with a comparative advantage in resources and readjust 
the industrial structure in keeping with the dynamic changes in 
the comparative advantage in resources, to ensure that we can 
fully use resources with a relative advantage to promote the 
development of the national economy at every stage of economic 
development. 
  2.09 The key to readjusting the relationships between 
industry and agriculture, and between cities and the 
countryside, does not lie in how we should "subsidize" or 
"protect" agriculture or other industries through government but 
in how we should develop the products market and production 
elements market so that the relative prices of all production 
elements and products can accurately reflect their relative 
scarcity. This way, the development of all industries can be 
rationally laid out in keeping with market price information, 
their own economic advantages brought into play, and equal 
competition achieved. Viewed from the angle of readjusting the 
traditional development strategy, in deepening rural reform we 
must mainly make breakthroughs in two things at the present 
stage, namely: Thoroughly smashing the planned purchase and 
marketing system and the city-countryside segregation system to 
promote the growth of the products market and the production 
elements market. 
  2.10 Thoroughly reforming the planned purchase and marketing 
system. Since the central authorities announced the abolition 
of the planned purchase and marketing system in 1985, the scope 
of planned purchase and marketing of farm products has shrunk 
greatly. However, the planned purchase and marketing of grain 
and some industrial materials is still, to varying degrees, 
being continued and this still has a very great influence on the 
development of the rural economy. Owing to the stagnant growth 
in grain output at one time, the purchase of grain has returned 
from the contract purchase as confirmed in 1985 to state 
purchase. Despite the fact that grain prices are close to the 
market prices after their prices were raised on several 
occasions, state purchase means that grain still cannot be 
totally regulated by the market. State purchase has the sense 
of obligation and taxation and is compulsory. In the process of 
implementing state purchase, it is apportioned among all peasant 
households. This, in fact, limits peasants from readjusting the 
industrial structure and rationally allocating resources in 
keeping with market price signals. Moreover, by retaining the 
form of state purchase, we in fact retain the government's right 
to use administrative means from time to time, and purchasing 
organizations which are performing the purchase tasks can 
continue to treat peasants haughtily. This leaves room for a 
structural relapse. Although this situation has changed a little 
in recent years since the removal of grain price controls was 
announced, it is still there. Therefore, we should quicken the 
reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system as we set up 
the grain risk fund and the reserve system and we should lift 
price controls over cotton and silkworm cocoons as soon as 
possible. 
  2.11 Break the city-countryside segregation system. Central 
Document No. 1 of 1984 allowed peasants intending to set up 
industries, do business, and offer services to take care of 
their grain supplies and to settle in small towns. In practice, 
this encouraged the rural population to migrate to small towns 
and promoted the development of these small towns. Later, 
however, this trend did not continue following the widening gap 
between the parity price and negotiated price of grain, the 
various unmatched urban management and development policies, and 
the changes in the macroeconomic environment. In recent years, 
following the development of the small industrial districts for 
township and town enterprises and of small towns run by peasants 
themselves, and the upsurge of the "wave of migrant workers," 
the hot wave of peasants flocking into cities has reappeared, 
having an impact on the old order in which cities and the 
countryside are segregated and loosening the city-countryside 
segregation system. The segregation between cities and the 
countryside inevitably distorts the prices of production 
elements making it impossible to fully develop the rich labor 
resources. On the other hand, it makes it impossible to use 
capital rationally and effectively. It not only limits the 
development of rural areas but narrows the room for the 
structural readjustment of cities themselves. Therefore, in 
order to promote interaction between cities and the countryside 
and readjust the industrial structure in a concentrated way, it 
is necessary to reform the various economic and social policies 
which segregate cities and the countryside, including those for 
household management, employment, housing, education, social 
security, and city development. The first step in breaking the 
barriers between cities and the countryside is that the state 
must no longer continue to foster and protect the sense of 
superiority of city residents, must not protect the privileges 
of cities at the expense of the interests of peasants and rural 
areas, and gradually cancel "shifting agriculture into 
nonagricultural sectors [nong zhuan fei 6593 6567 7236]." 
Second, while allowing peasants to enter and settle in small 
towns and in medium and small cities, we should also allow them 
to come into big cities and megacities and improve and perfect 
city management methods accordingly. 
  The Probability of Creating a New Macropolicy 
Environment 
  2.12 Reforming the macropolicy environment which suits the 
traditional development strategy means a readjustment of all 
vested interests. If this is not done properly, it will lead to 
social contradictions. However, with the past dozen years or 
more of reform, China's comprehensive national strength has 
continuously increased and the people's living standards have 
greatly improved, people have a stronger psychological endurance 
for the reform of their own interests, and everyone tends 
increasingly to sympathize with market structure reform. All 
this has created the basic preconditions for pursuing this 
reform. 
  2.13 Owing to the changes brought about in the industrial 
structure by the speedy economic growth in the 1980's, 
especially the speedy development of light industry, China's 
industrial accumulative capability has obviously strengthened. 
With the readjustment of the prices of major farm products on 
several occasions, the exchange of industrial and farm products 
already tends to be at equal prices. Following the speedy 
increase in the income of city staff and workers, the Engel's 
Coefficient of food consumption began to decrease. In 1991, 
grain expenditure only accounted for 6.5 percent of the living 
expenses of urban residents. This meant that low-priced farm 
products no longer played a decisive role in maintaining low 
labor costs. The contribution of farm products supplies to 
urban society has already had a change in nature, namely that it 
has changed from offering accumulations for industry into 
offering security for society. In view of this, there no longer 
exist preconditions for continuing the policies of planned 
purchase and marketing and of city-countryside segregation. 
  2.14 Since reform, there have been noticeable changes in the 
accumulative form of national income and in the course of 
capital flows. Following the growth of enterprises' incomes and 
personal discretionary incomes, banking and credit have 
accordingly replaced finance as the main channel of financing 
and investment; securities, insurance, and real estate have 
opened up new areas of investment; and banks' savings-absorbing 
ability has greatly strengthened and a diversified investment 
pattern has already been formed. On this basis, we not only 
find it necessary to deepen monetary system reform but we also 
have increasingly ripe conditions. As long as we straighten out 
the monetary system and policy and maintain the stability of the 
state's various basic reform policies, coupled with the people's 
inherent tendency to save money, the accumulation rate and 
utilization rate of national income will not decrease overall. 
In the meantime, since we have straightened out the distorted 
policy environment so that the comparative advantages of 
different sectors and different regions can be fully released, 
it will greatly increase the overall efficiency of the national 
economy. 
  2.15 Quickening the development of the products and 
production elements market is also badly needed for further 
opening to the outside world, and participating in international 
competition, and for the government to establish new regulating 
and controlling mechanisms. China's rejoining GATT as a member 
will mean that industrial and farm products will, without 
exception, participate in international competition. If we do 
not perfect the market regulating and controlling mechanisms as 
soon as possible so that all sectors can enhance their own 
competitiveness according to market rules, then we will lose the 
relative economic advantage we have or even let our national 
income drain away through irrational prices. Viewed from the 
level of the state's macroscopic regulating and controlling 
mechanisms, the original purchase and marketing system which 
guarantees the supply of accumulations from agriculture to 
industry has already become a big burden on the government's 
expenditure. As a result of the fact that controls over the 
purchasing prices of major farm products have been lifted while 
the sales prices in cities lag behind, the amount the government 
has to allocate from its budget to subsidize the price 
difference between purchase and marketing comes to tens of 
billions of yuan and the efficiency this produces is becoming 
increasingly low and the state will find it increasingly 
difficult to support it financially. 
  2.16 In the forthcoming structural readjustment, the most 
active force is still the hundreds of millions of peasants. In 
fact, in recent years, peasants have begun to take advantage of 
the current reform environment to tackle the deep-level 
composition of the irrational traditional development strategy. 
What is most noteworthy is the trend wherein peasants are 
breaking the barriers between cities and the countryside and 
directly participating in urbanization. According to expert 
surveys and estimates, the migrant population flowing from the 
countryside into cities has rapidly increased since the 
mid-1980's. In 1988, the total number of migrant population had 
already reached 70 million with 59.34 percent flowing from rural 
areas. In 1992, the migrant population coming from the 
countryside into cities remained at 35.75 million per day, most 
of whom were job seekers. The unstoppable migrant population 
has created the "wave of peasant workers" which is worsening 
annually and has become a hot point of concern to society and 
the media. Peasants' entry into cities has not only quickened 
the development of tertiary industry but also spurred the reform 
of the city management structure. In megacities like Beijing 
there are already residential areas for the migrant population 
such as "Zhejiang Village." In the villages in these cities, 
the autonomy of residents in the real sense has begun to emerge. 
Special economic zones and development areas like Shenzhen, 
Xiamen, Haikou, and Beihai have a comparatively high proportion 
of migrant population. They have become migrant cities which 
are different from other cities. Their development and 
management have also become more suited to the population flows. 
In places where township and town enterprises are comparatively 
concentrated, a number of small cities and towns are quickly 
emerging, even such new cities as Zhejiang's Longgang Township 
which was all built by the pooling of funds among peasants 
themselves. 
  2.17 Another notable phenomenon is that since price controls 
on grain have been lifted, the nongovernmental circulation 
channels formed under the previous "double-track pricing system" 
for grain purchase and marketing have been rapidly expanding. 
State-owned grain stations find it "difficult to purchase 
grain." On the other hand, nongovernmental grain dealers are 
unprecedentedly active. According to surveys, in typically big 
agricultural provinces, the volume of interprovincial grain 
exchange through nonstate channels already exceeds one-fourth of 
the total. In the entire circulation of farm products including 
grain, there is an active large sales force consisting of tens 
of thousands of peasants. A number of wholesale markets run by 
peasants themselves have been set up, forming a new and 
noticeable pivot for farm products circulation channels. The 
wholesale volume of vegetables in Beijing's Dazhongsi Wholesale 
Market, for instance, already accounts for over one-third of the 
city's total supplies. 
  2.18 Following the reform of the city industrial 
enterprise system and the monetary system, the segregation in 
reciprocal investment between cities and the countryside is 
being broken through. At present, it happens that in various 
localities peasants go into cities and contract on state-run or 
collective enterprises and that township and town enterprises 
and city enterprises carry out joint operations, cooperate, and 
buy or even hold each other's shares. Moreover, some 
enterprises in cities, especially some food processing 
enterprises, are beginning to change from dependence on the 
government to directly establishing affiliated or cooperative 
relationships with peasant producers. They play a very positive 
leading role in the production of some farm products. 
  2.19 To sum up what we have talked about above, we can 
conclude that China's rural economy in the 1990's will enter a 
stage of change in its development strategy. At this stage, the 
structural readjustment for the establishment of new 
relationships between cities and the countryside and for a 
development strategy for the national economy will be the basic 
characteristics of rural economic development. Changing the 
traditional macropolicy environment and promoting the further 
growth of the products market and the production elements market 
in order to complete this strategic change, will be the 
mainstream of rural reform in the 1990's.

  [Text] Xuzhou, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Xuzhou in east China's 
Jiangsu province used to be contested by all strategists due to 
military purposes, but today it has assumed new importance in 
line with its strategic position -- it has now become a key 
goods distributing center of coal, iron and steel, oil, 
machinery, durables and daily necessities. 
  Early at dawn, the city is thronged with business people and 
motor vehicles carrying fresh vegetables and other commodities 
from almost all parts of the country to sell goods or purchase 
what they need. 
  A survey shows that the transaction volume of vegetables 
alone in Xuzhou tops 300,000 kilograms a day. 
  "Xuzhou's business is so developed that people from all 
corners of the country wish to dig into it for profits," said 
Huang Yuannan, a businessman from east China's Zhejiang Province 
who is operating a stall of decorations at the Xuanwu small 
commodities market. 
  He disclosed that his fellow natives have booked some 500 
stalls at the market. 
  Jiang Qijun, a businessman from Harbin, capital of northeast 
China's Heilongjiang Province, has made big profits by 
operating a furniture shop and engaging in furniture-making in 
the Kaiming market. The 30-year-old man now has fixed assets 
worth several hundred thousand yuan. 
  Both Jiang and Xu are typical examples of 10,000 business 
people from other parts of the country who open shops in Xuzhou. 
  In the afternoon and evening, Xuzhou's five major state 
department stores are the best places for visitors and shoppers. 
  These splendid stores are a feast for the eyes and shop 
assistants with smiling faces are always ready to offer a 
helping hand. 
  Xuzhou is located in the area where Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan 
and Anhui Provinces meet, and at the bank of the ancient 
Beijing-Hangzhou grand canal, where the Lianyungang-Lanzhou and 
Beijing- Shanghai railways meet. 
  Known as a "museum of war," the city has experienced more 
than 200 battles in history. 
  "It was its geographical location provided with convenient 
transport facilities that has enabled the city to develop into a 
business center," said Yu Xianrong, director of the Xuzhou 
Bureau of Commerce. 
  According to Xu Jiping, director of the Xuzhou City 
Administration for Industry and Commerce, Xuzhou has set up 437 
markets of farm produce, trade businesses, small commodities, 
industrial products and production factors, with an annual 
transaction volume totalling 12.5 billion yuan. 
  "These markets are paving the way for the city to further 
boost the market economy," said Li Yangzhen, a senior official 
of the city. 
  More and more Xuzhou citizens have abandoned their view of 
distaste toward business careers. 
  According to statistics, Xuzhou has more than 100,000 
registered private business people. 
  While welcoming business people from across the country, 
Xuzhou is further improving its investment conditions to attract 
overseas investment. 
  So far, 220 Taiwan-funded companies have opened service in 
the city.

  [Text] After reading a XINHUA news account about the press 
units symposium sponsored by the central propaganda department 
in the country's capital, which urged the authorities to sound 
frequent warnings to the press circles, Governor Wu Guanzheng 
issued an important written instruction on strengthening the 
building of professional ethics in the journalist ranks. In his 
instruction, the governor urged journalists to draw a lesson 
from the fact that a small number of reporters violated the law 
and committed offenses in the illegal fund-raising activities of 
the Great Wall Company. He told them to behave properly and 
stick to correct opinion guidance as the society undertakes 
major changes, to attach importance to ideological problems, and 
to strive to remold their own subjective world while changing 
the objective world. 
  The Jiangxi Provincial CPC Committee Propaganda Department 
attached great importance to the building of professional ethics 
in the journalist ranks. Zhong Qihuang, Standing Committee 
member of and propaganda department director of the provincial 
party committee presided over a regular meeting of principal 
persons in charge of the press units under the direct 
jurisdiction of the provincial government on media, publication, 
and propaganda work. The meeting worked out a specific plan to 
thoroughly educate the press in professional ethics and 
strengthen the building of the ranks of journalists and decided 
to slate May as the professional ethics education month for the 
province's journalists. For this purpose, the meeting issued a 
circular containing the requirements of the month's activities.

  [Text] The 14th annual meeting of the Sino-Japan 
Association for the Exchange of Economic Knowledge ended in 
Jinan on the afternoon of 11 May after completing all items on 
the agenda. In the past 2 days, members of the Chinese and 
Japanese sides made a profound analysis of the current economic 
situation of the world and the trends of economic development in 
East Asia, extensively explored the channels and prospects of 
cooperation between China and Japan in multiple spheres, and 
offered some valuable views on the multilateral economic 
cooperation. This association has paid high attention to the 
economic development of Shandong Province. At the meeting held 
on the afternoon of 11 May, this association specially discussed 
on Shandong's economic development. 
  Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party 
Committee, and Zhao Zhihao, governor of the province, 
respectively delivered speeches at the meeting. They profoundly 
discussed and exchanged views on the issue of further expanding 
the friendly cooperation between Shandong and Japan. Jiang 
Chunyun and Zhao Zhihao maintained: Japan is a major economic 
and trade cooperation partner of Shandong. The convocation of 
this meeting will bring about a new opportunity for the economic 
cooperation between Shandong and Japan. The vistas of the 
economic and trade cooperation between Shandong and Japan are 
vast. 
  Jiang Chunyun and Zhao Zhihao pointed out: Looking forward 
to the future of the economic and trade exchanges between 
Shandong and Japan, there are many favorable conditions and 
great potentials. First, the exchanges between Shandong and 
Japan have a long history and a good cooperation foundation. 
Second, from the view of optimizing the setup of productive 
forces, Shandong and Japan are much complemented with each other 
in the economy. Third, both China and Japan are located in East 
Asia and thus there are geological advantages in the economic 
and trade cooperation between the two countries. So long as we 
persist in the principles of mutual benefit and making up for 
each other's deficiency with one's advantages, much can be 
accomplished in the economic and trade coopratrion between the 
two sides. 
  On the evening of 11 May, Comrade Gu Mu hosted a banquet to 
warmly entertain members of the Japanese and China sides. He 
congratulated the annual meeting on its successful convocation.

  [Text] Jinan, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Shandong Province in East 
China has pledged to help all its residents shake off poverty 
within five years. 
  In China the poverty line means that people have an annual 
income of less than 200 yuan per capita and less than 200 kg of 
grain a year. 
  A provincial official in charge of the aid-the-poor project 
said that Shandong has made progress in this field over the past 
decade and the number of poor people has dropped to four million 
at present. 
  These people are mainly distributed in remote mountainous, 
beach and lake areas with adverse production and living 
conditions. 
  According to the plan, the governor will be in charge of the 
overall work, while local officials' promotion will be linked to 
the project. 
  While allocating more funds, the province will speed up the 
construction of infrastructure facilities in rural areas to 
ensure that every village is linked with roads, and supplied 
with electricity and fresh water. 
  It will also popularize education and science, and launch 
publicity about personal hygiene and environmental sanitation in 
rural areas.

  Taian City's project on second-phase comprehensive 
agricultural development of Huang He, Huai He, and Hai He passed 
the provincial acceptance test a few days ago. This project has 
involved 43 township and towns in five counties, cities, and 
districts. Over the past three years, a total of 73.74 million 
yuan have been invested in this project. In the areas covered 
by this project, some 400,000 mu of irrigated fields have been 
increased or improved, and the coverage rate of forest has been 
raised to 16.8 percent. In 1993, the per capita net income of 
peasants in the areas covered by this project was 1,078.2 yuan, 
65.2 yuan more than the average of the city.

<F P=106> [By staff correspondent Zhang Chuanxi (1728 0278 3556)] </F>
  [Text] Guangzhou, 10 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- An 
analysis by economists here of Guangdong's economic situation 
over the past five months identifies the following new 
characteristics: A noticeable drop in rate, breakthroughs in 
macroeconomic regulation and control in individual sectors, and 
the appearance of many serious problems. 
  Under the economic development target of catching up with 
the 
"four little dragons of Asia" which was put forward in the wake 
of Deng Xiaoping's southern inspection tour, Guangdong -- in 
actual operations -- has eased up on the previously planned 
economic retrenchment. Guangdong's economy has been developing 
at an extremely high rate over the past three years. Its GDP 
rose 17.3 percentage points in 1991, 21 in 1992, and 22 last 
year. As its economy grew at high rates, its economic power 
increased rapidly, and it now plays a notable role in China's 
economy. 
  However, Guangdong's economic growth obviously has slowed 
down since early this year. Its first-quarter GDP growth has 
been predicted to be 15 percentage points, compared with the 20 
percentage points registered in the same period last year -- a 
glaring contrast from recent years. 
  Experts analyzed that the marked economic slowdown was 
caused 
mainly by the government's strengthening of macroregulatory and 
control measures, tightening of credit, and curbing of building 
projects; in addition, fluctuations in policy triggered by the 
introduction of various reformist measures this year have played 
a role. Against last year's 32 percent growth in first-quarter 
industrial output value, this year saw only 21 percent growth -- 
a drop of 11 percentage points. 
  Falling industrial development rates have had a direct 
impact 
on the overall economic growth rate, but also have reduced 
longstanding "bottleneck" constraints on the province, resulting 
in improvement in the overall economic environment. This is one 
new salient characteristic of Guangdong's economic development 
this year. 
  On the other hand, Guangdong has achieved some successes in 
macroregulation and control this year, with breakthroughs 
registered by individual economic indicators. This is the 
positive side to Guangdong's economic development this year. 
  Government-released figures gave a 51 percent fulfillment 
rate for this year's first-quarter fixed-asset investment, up 51 
percent, which is lower than in the same period last year, 
indicating that the abrupt surge in fixed-asset investment 
starting the year before is now under control. Falling 
fixed-asset investment is helping to reverse the problem of 
economic disequilibrium sparked by excessively rapid growth in 
investment. 
  Guangdong's foreign trade and exports in the first quarter 
increased 22 percent from the same period last year to $8.2 
billion. Trade surplus from the first-quarter imports and 
exports topped $100 million. Such a large margin of increase in 
foreign trade and exports has been rare in recent years. The 
good situation established by foreign trade mitigated the 
contradiction of imbalanced growth between imports and exports 
seen last year. 
  In addition, Guangdong's financial revenue in the first 
quarter rose 48 percent, and industrial and commercial tax rates 
rose significantly. This has been the one among Guangdong's 
several economic indicators registering the greatest growth so 
far this year. 
  However, economic activities in the first quarter also 
uncovered many problems. Experts here pointed out that there 
would be economic, and even social turmoil if these problems 
were not handled well. These problems include: 
  1. It is clear that industrial production is operating far 
below capacity. As the pillars for industrial development, in 
terms of production, the province's state-owned budgetary 
industries this year have performed very badly. Output value 
fell 4.2 percentage points from the same period last year; 
profits were down 38 percent, with 43 percent of the industries 
suffering losses, up 9 percentage points from the same period 
last year. Several factors contributed to this situation: 
Shortages in funds forced some factories to maintain production 
and fund projects with lending; persistently high prices raised 
production costs, with the result that some products ceased to 
be competitive in price and were forced out of the market; and 
the government adopted the policy of scaling down infrastructure 
projects, so many projects could not be launched, sapping the 
economic development of reserve strength. 
  Apart from affecting overall economic growth, a sharp 
decline 
in industrial production also has aggravated unemployment, 
making the problem of slumps in the state-owned enterprise 
sector more acute. 
  2. Greater inflationary pressure: Prices in Guangdong have 
continued to rise since early this year, on top of last year's 
increase of 18.2 percentage points. Prices in January rose 1.9 
percentage points from last December, then another 4.2 
percentage points in February, and continued rising in March. 
Total social retail prices in the first quarter rose 33 
percent, up 4 percentage points from the same period last year 
-- a rather steep hike. Factors such as greater inflationary 
pressure stimulating growth in consumption power played a role 
in this. 
  3. Shortages in funds have worsened the existing debt chains 
in the economic sector and have taken away the necessary support 
for economic development. High interest rates across the board 
have affected financial order. 
  4. Agriculture is still beset by hidden problems. Despite a 
3 percent agricultural growth last year, Guangdong saw drastic 
reductions in major agricultural products, such as grains and 
sugar cane. Self-sufficiency in grains has remained an acute 
problem this year. Although spring farming enjoyed a good 
start, there should be no premature optimism concerning the 
prospects for agriculture, as factors hampering development in 
agricultural production remain.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Guangzhou city, 
capital of Guangdong Province, recently shut down 113 
overseas-funded enterprises for failing to fulfill their 
contracts. 
  According to the Guangzhou City Bureau of Industry and 
Commerce, the measure taken by the Guangzhou City Government is 
aimed at enhancing management of overseas-funded enterprises. 
  An official of the bureau noted that all licenses of the 113 
overseas-funded enterprises were withdrawn by the bureau. 
  He said that the 113 enterprises, including Guangzhou Garden 
Exhibition Center, Guangzhou Kangbao Beverage Co. Ltd. and 
Huaxian New Lake Hotel, did not put in funds according to 
contract or provided insufficient funds. As a result, the 
enterprises could not operate normally. 
  He said that the 113 enterprises which were shut down 
account 
for only 2 percent of the total number of Guangzhou's 
overseas-funded enterprises which had been approved by relevant 
Guangzhou departments. 
  He said that most of the overseas-funded enterprises in 
Guangzhou are abiding by Chinese laws and contracts and their 
rights and interests will be protected by the government. 
  He said that with the deepening of the reforms and expanding 
of opening to the outside world in the country, Guangzhou will 
enhance supervision over the operation of overseas-funded 
enterprises and help promote their business.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Jianjun (0491 1696 6511): "The Inner </F>
Mongolia Autonomous Regional Party Committee and Government 
Cosponsored a Financial Work Forum"] 
  [Excerpts] On 25 April, the regional party committee and 
government cosponsored a regional financial work forum to 
analyze the regional financial situation and to study and work 
out methods for resolving the current financial difficulties. 
  Present at the forum were regional leaders Bai Enpei, Liu 
Zuohui, Song Zhimin, Shen Shuji, and Bao Wenfa; and leaders of 
the regional departments concerned, all leagues and cities, and 
some banner and county party and government departments. Bai 
Enpei, Liu Zuohui, and Song Zhimin made important speeches at 
the forum. The forum was chaired by Bai Enpei. 
  Along with the ceaseless deepening of reform and the rapid 
development of the economy since the third plenary session of 
the 11th party Central Committee, our region has registered big 
increases in revenues with each passing year. The region's 
revenues in 1980 was 413 million yuan; those in 1985, 1.136 
billion yuan; those in 1888, 2.35 billion yuan; those in 1992, 
3.91 billion yuan; and those in 1993 rapidly increased to 5.61 
billion yuan. Song Zhimin pointed out in his speech: The 
region's revenues continued to double for several times in the 
past 10 years or so. Simultaneously, the region's economic and 
social undertakings have developed at an increasingly faster 
speed. Increasingly more financial resources have been spent to 
develop economic and social undertakings. The input to the 
construction of production projects and the development of 
undertakings continues to increase with each passing year. The 
number of personnel to be provided by the financial departments 
increases at an excessively high speed. The income of staff and 
workers and cadres increases with each passing year. The 
financial burdens become heavier and heavier. Leagues, cities, 
banners, and counties differ greatly in revenues. Meanwhile, 
problems of collecting, managing, and using financial resources 
exist in varying degrees among the financial departments at 
various levels. All this helps enhance the contradictions 
between the region's revenues and expenditures. The financial 
difficulties, cropping up in the course of promoting the 
economic construction, rapidly developing other undertakings, 
and ceaselessly improving the people's livelihood, are temporary 
difficulties in the course of advance and development. So long 
as we persistently implement the line, principles, and policies 
of the party will the financial difficulties certainly be 
alleviated and eliminated in a step-by-step manner along with 
the ceaseless deepening of reform and the sustained development 
of the economy. [passage omitted] 
  At the time of collecting financial resources, the financial 
departments at various levels should conscientiously manage both 
budgetary funds and extrabudgetary funds. Under the leadership 
of the governments at various levels, the financial departments 
should further arrange, in a unified manner, available financial 
resources and expenditures; and make arrangements for the use of 
funds in the order of importance and urgency. We should first 
ensure the payment of wages in accordance with the principle of 
feeding the people primarily and building the country 
secondarily and the principle of acting according to 
capabilities; and arrange the expenses in other aspects 
according to the principle of keeping expenditures within the 
limits of income. We should strengthen and achieve the 
distribution of financial funds, do our best to shorten the 
capital turnover period, and ensure the timely distribution of 
capital. The banks at various levels should support the rapid 
distribution of financial funds, avoid the occurrence of the 
phenomenon of keeping the capital that should be allocated, and 
ensure the timely turnover of capital. The tax departments at 
various levels should strengthen the management of tax revenues, 
widely open tax resources, handle tax affairs persistently 
according to laws, calculate taxes according to tax rates, and 
collect and hand over to the state the taxes that should be 
collected and handed over. The banking departments at various 
levels should positively collect funds, try every possible means 
to alleviate the strain on capital, and better support the 
economic construction and the production of enterprises. The 
governments at various levels should support the financial 
departments to develop deposits, assimilate savings from 
society, increase available funds, and enliven the existing 
funds. [passage omitted] 
  Bai Enpei finally stressed: We should strengthen leadership, 
rely on the masses, work arduously, and jointly overcome the 
financial difficulties. The party committees and governments at 
various levels should realistically strengthen the leadership 
over the financial work, regularly conduct research, carefully 
make arrangements, and timely solve various kinds of 
difficulties. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, may 12 (XINHUA) -- A mobile telephone 
network will cover the whole of north China's Hebei Province by 
the end of the year. 
  An agreement to import mobile telecommunications equipment 
with a total capacity of more than 70,000 terminals from the 
Ericsson Radio System AB of Sweden was signed here Tuesday. 
  Officials from the Hebei Provincial Posts and 
Telecommunications Bureau said that upon completion of the 
installation by the end of this year, mobile telephone calls 
from any of all 103 counties and cities in the province will 
automatically reach receivers in neighboring Tianjin and Beijing 
cities. 
  The province built its first mobile telecommunications 
system 
in 1987. However, by the end of April this year, the total 
number of mobile phone users topped 17,000. 
  The agreement, which is the third import transaction with 
the 
Swedish company, involves some 28.59 million U.S. dollars. 
  Wei Enhong, director of the provincial telecommunications 
bureau, said that the province is set to install more mobile 
phones in the coming few years to meet increasing demands. By 
1998, the expected number of mobile phone users will top 
300,000, some 17.5 times the existing number.

published in the 9 May China Daily Report on pages 61-62 
entitled "Zou Jiahua Praises Jilin's Automobile Project" 
replacing the following item] 
  [Text] Changchun, 6 Apr (XINHUA) -- The 150,000-sedan 
production line project of the Volkswagen company under the 
First Automobile Group I/E Corporation -- China's largest modern 
sedan manufacturing base -- has entered the last stage of 
construction. The Jilin provincial party committee and the 
provincial government recently held a mobilization meeting at 
the corporation at which they declared the project has been 
listed as the province's "priority project," and they pledged to 
have it completed and put into operation by the end of this year. 
  The project, the construction of which started in 1991, is a 
major project listed in the state's Eighth Five-Year Plan and is 
currently the largest joint venture in the country's machinery 
industry. Requiring an area of 218,000 square meters, the 
project will have internationally first-class equipment. When 
the first phase of the project is completed, the production line 
will turn out 150,000 sedans a year. The total investment for 
this project is 1.26 billion yuan. When the second phase of the 
project is completed, the company will be able to turn out 
300,000 sedans a year. When the entire project is completed, 
the company will become China's largest modern sedan 
manufacturing base turning out Jetta and Golf sedans. 
  After three years of hard work by 30 domestic and foreign 
design and construction units which carried out design, 
construction, installation, and production debugging 
simultaneously, about 80 percent of the planned total investment 
has been completed. A modern sedan production base with four 
large buildings has taken shape. Adhering to the principle of 
carrying out construction and production simultaneously while 
striving to increase the rate of self-sufficiency in the 
automobile industry, the Volkswagen company under the First 
Automobile Group I/E Corporation organized the production of 
sedans in 1992 by putting up a temporary production line. By 
the end of last year, it had manufactured more than 20,000 Jetta 
sedans for sale on the market. It also set up more than 100 
special service facilities throughout the country.

  [Text] On 28 April, the provincial government held a 
provincial televised conference on financial and tax work to 
comprehensively implement and accurately understand the new 
financial and tax system, to support enterprise production, to 
promote economic development, to safeguard social stability, and 
to comprehensively fulfill the 1994 financial and tax revenue 
tasks. The conference reported on the situation emerged since 
the implementation of the new financial and tax system, set 
forth some policies and methods for solving some specific 
problems, and studied and arranged the next-step financial and 
tax work. Liu Xilin, vice governor of the provincial 
government, made an important speech. 
  On the provincial economic situation, Liu Xilin pointed out: 
Since the beginning of this year, according to the requirements 
and arrangements of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, our province has grasped favorable opportunities, 
deepened reform, expanded the scale of opening up, promoted 
development, maintained stability, and continued to promote the 
development of the national economy on the basis of the faster 
economic growth rate of last year. A good rural economic 
situation rarely seen before has emerged. The investment scale 
is controlled strictly within the plan. The construction of key 
projects is further strengthened. The scale of opening up has 
ceaselessly been expanded. Noticeable progress has been made in 
inviting businessmen, bringing in foreign capital, and 
developing foreign export trade. Revenues have been increased. 
The credit scale has been expanded. The financial situation is 
stable. However, worries still exist. The industrial 
production growth rate was changed from the faster development 
in 1993 to a slow speed in the first quarter of this year. 
Thus, great difficulties have been added on enterprises, 
enterprises' economic results tend to decline, and the burdens 
on price hikes are rather high. 
  On the issue of how to treat the new situation and new 
problems cropping up since the implementation of the new 
financial and tax system, Liu Xilin pointed out: The general 
situation over the past four months has been good since the 
implementation of the new financial and tax system. No bigger 
fluctuation has been created by the reform of the tax system. 
The increase in the revenues has been maintained. Affected by 
the fact that the implementation of the new financial and tax 
system is related to the readjustment of the interests of 
various fronts as well as an all-round and integrated structural 
reform, it is unavoidable that different trades, enterprises, 
and products have different burdens and different changes. 
Besides, the new tax system should embody equal tax burdens and 
the state industrial policy requirements to promote equal 
competition. Some enterprises that used to rely on the 
protections of tax reductions and profit concessions for 
development will lose their preferential conditions. 
Simultaneously, the industries that should be readjusted 
according to the state industrial policies and the enterprises 
with unreasonable economic scales, poor quality, and high 
production costs will naturally come across serious challenges 
and difficulties. We must be sober-headed to treat the problems 
in this regard. We should also understand that problems of this 
or that kind still exist in course of implementing the new 
system due to the fact that the new system is being replaced by 
the old one. Some large and medium-sized enterprises' tax 
burdens rise by a big margin. Meanwhile, with the strain on 
capital, the decline in economic results, and the changes in 
markets, enterprises actually have great difficulties. Both the 
state and the province have paid full attention to this and have 
studied or are studying measures to solve the problems in this 
aspect. 
  Liu Xilin particularly pointed out: Although the financial 
and tax revenues have kept on increasing since the 
implementation of the new financial and tax system, the 
situation in the implementation of the new situation is not 
ideal enough. The revenues in the first quarter of this year 
increased by 10.5 percent over the same period of last year and 
accounted for 15.7 percent of the annual plan. The industrial 
and commercial tax revenues in this period increased by 3.4 
percent and accounted for 14.3 percent of the annual plan. The 
financial and tax situation is comparatively grim. This aspect 
is related to the current economic situation. Simultaneously, 
the people have prejudice against the new financial and tax 
system. A very important content of the new system is to 
guarantee the 1993 vested financial resources of the localities. 
Although the consumption taxes belong to the central revenues 
and the value added taxes are divided between the central 
financial department and the localities, the central financial 
department do not obtain the portions covered in the base 
figures of consumption taxes and value added taxes. That is, 
the portions covered in the base figures will totally be 
obtained by the localities. If the localities do not reach the 
1993 levels this year, the state should reduce the 1993 base 
figures. In this way, both the balance between this year's 
revenues and expenditures and the development of the province as 
a whole and all cities and counties will be affected. It is 
extremely wrong that we continue to follow the habitual methods 
of putting the collection of the local fixed revenues before 
that of value added taxes, as stipulated in the previous old 
system. This must be changed. The governments at various 
levels, all departments concerned, and enterprises should seek 
unity of thinking, comprehensively implement the new financial 
and tax system, realistically strengthen the collection and 
management of tax revenues, try every possible means to support 
production, specifically carry out the system for responsibility 
for fulfillment of fixed work, and ensure a balance between this 
year's revenues and expenditures. 
  The provincial government urged that the financial and tax 
departments at various levels should foster the idea of 
supporting production and positively promote increases in 
production and revenues. Particularly in the course of 
reforming the financial and tax system, we should realistically 
strengthen the coordinate service for enterprises, help 
enterprise resolve practical difficulties, timely implement the 
state financial and tax preferential policies, and study ways 
for solving some specific problems. The financial departments 
at various levels should mainly concentrate turnover funds on 
the current industrial production. The tax departments should 
find out ways to reduce burdens for the enterprises with special 
difficulties according to the "tax law" and timely report to 
higher levels the problems that cannot be solved by themselves. 
According to some state tax policies and in line with the 
provincial specific situation, the conference defined 13 
specific policy measures for supporting the development of 
enterprises.

  [Text] The provincial public security department and the

few days ago to commend three collectives, including the Navy 
border defense work station of Yingkou city, and 20 individuals, 
including (Liu Zhiqi), officer of the Dalian city border defense 
corps, for their outstanding contributions to defending the

  [Excerpts] Yesterday afternoon the provincial party 
committee held a monthly meeting, which was presided over by Yin 
Keshing, secretary of the provincial party committee. Briefing 
the meeting on the results of his recent inspection of township 
and town enterprises in Jiangsu, he said: Jiangsu has superior 
geographic conditions. Its drive of reform and opening up to 
the outside world and its economic development program are 
progressing rapidly. Particularly, township and town enterprises 
in Jiangsu have played a leading role in the country as a whole 
and have made important contributions in terms of development. 
At present its township and town enterprises have made certain 
achievements in terms of scope, quality, and level and have 
occupied a decisive position in the province's national economic 
development. Township and town enterprises have scaled new 
heights in terms of quality, grade, scope, and efficiency. 
  The export-oriented economy has developed vigorously. 
Jiangsu has utilized large quantities of foreign capital and is 
home to many joint-venture enterprises. The development of 
township and town enterprises is closely integrated with rural 
construction. The grand prospect for a new socialist 
countryside characterized by the modernization of agriculture, 
industrialization of rural areas, urbanization of villages, 
socialization of services, and education of peasants is 
gradually being materialized. 
  Yin Kesheng said: Considering the development of township 
and town enterprises in Jiangsu Province, our province must 
learn from and use as a reference Jiangsu's experience in the 
following areas: 
  1. We should always implement the leading principle of 
grasping opportunities and accelerating development, firmly 
foster the idea of development being the last word, and persist 
in striving for rapid development with good results if 
conditions permit. 
  2. We should persist in promoting development with reform 
and place great stress on seeking solutions to the 
contradictions and problems that crop up in the course of 
economic operation by deepening reform. 
  3. We should encourage township and town enterprises to get 
involved in the market so that they will decide their 
development orientation, seek development, optimize their 
structure, and establish their own operational mechanisms. 
  4. We should persist in simultaneously grasping the two 
civilizations and strive for new breakthroughs in building 
spiritual civilization while accelerating economic development. 
  Yin Kesheng pointed out: The development situation of 
township and town enterprises in our province in the last few 
years is fine on the whole, but, compared with the other parts 
of the country, we still have a long way to go. 1) Our 
province's township and town enterprises are small in scope; 2) 
the strong points which ought to be brought into play have not 
been duly brought into play; 3) fund and talent shortages are 
relatively pronounced; 4) the level of enterprise management is 
low. [passage omitted] 
  The provincial party committee will hold a township and town 
enterprise work meeting at an appropriate time this year to 
study, in a concentrated way, ways of developing our province's 
township and town enterprises more rapidly and with better 
results. [passage omitted] 
  Yin Kesheng urged the principal party and government leaders 
of prefectures and cities to personally take up the work of 
developing township and town enterprises and township and town 
enterprise bureaus at all levels to strengthen themselves 
organizationally by providing more and better leaders and 
personnel, fulfilling their duties, and boldly carrying out 
their work. [passage omitted] 
  Present at the meeting were the standing committee members 
of 
the provincial party committee, including Cai Zhulin, Doba, Tang 
Zhengren, Wang Hanmin, and Yao Xiangcheng.

  Governor Tian Chengping, chairman of the provincial people's 
armament committee, discussed his views on attaching further 
importance to bringing into play the role of the militia and 
reserve forces in our province's development and stability. He 
pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the political 
construction of the militia and reserve forces, conduct more 
publicity work and education, do regular ideological and 
political work, ensure the party's absolute leadership over the 
armed forces, and do a good job in improving the quality of the 
militia and reserve forces in accordance with the principle of 
troops being small in number, but politically strong. He said: 
Militia training should be sharpened; education should be 
conducted on a regular basis; equipment should be improved; 
importance should be attached to the building of militia units 
responsible for handling emergencies; and stress should be 
placed on the militia's coordination and cooperation with the 
public security and armed police forces, and on solving the 
problem of adequate maintenance and supplies for the militia and 
reserve forces. He stressed that party committees and 
governments at all levels must strengthen leadership over armed 
forces work and must genuinely discharge the duty of the party 
managing the armed forces.

  [Text]An autonomous regional work conference on state civil 
service system and wage reform was held in Urumqi yesterday. 
Speaking at the conference, Autonomous Regional Chairman 
Abulaiti Abudurexiti pointed out: We must fully recognize the 
role and the importance of personnel system in economic 
construction and do a good job in personnel affairs under the 
new situation. The reform of personnel system must be guided by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and closely 
centered around the main theme of economic construction. We 
must establish a personnel system in compliance with the demands 
of market economy. The implementation of the state civil 
service system is aimed at establishing a socialist cadre 
administration system with Chinese characteristics, 
strengthening and invigorating government operations, improving 
government personnel's quality and efficiency, and making the 
government's personnel administration system scientific and 
legal. 
  Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: While focusing on promoting the 
civil service system, we must vigorously carry out personnel 
system reform in institutions and enterprises.

  [Text] Urumqi, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Xinjiang has entered the 
era of mechanical farming, a group of officials from the 
Ministry of Agriculture concluded after a recent visit to the 
northwest China autonomous region 
  The officials said the region's level of agricultural 
mechanization had reached the year-2000-goal set by the ministry 
for the nation's agriculture as a whole. 
  A report released by the regional agricultural department 
says that Xinjiang now has 340,000 tractors and other farm 
machines, worth 2.2 billion yuan. 
  The report says 85 percent of the region's 3.1 million ha of 
farmlands is now ploughed by tractors, and 74 percent are sowed 
by machines. 
  Other farm work, such as harvesting, laying plastic sheet, 
transportation and preliminary processing of farm products have 
also been mechanized to a large extent, the report says. 
  According to the report, Xinjiang now tops all other Chinese 
regions in the mechanization of sowing and plastic-sheet cover 
of crops. 
  The mechanization of farm work has resulted in a great 
improvement in productivity. The report says that Xinjiang's 
agricultural output value has been increasing at an annual rate 
of 6.4 percent over the last 16 years. 
  With an output of 680,000 tons of cotton, Xinjiang was 
China's No. 1 producer of cotton in 1993. It was also a major 
producer of oilseeds, sugar crops and fruit. 
  Meanwhile, the region has developed a wide network of 
farm-machine marketing, maintenance, management and other 
services, employing a total 230,000 people, says the report.

  [Text] Hangzhou, 11 May (XINHUA) -- Xu Huiyou [Hsu 
Hui-yu], deputy secretary general of Taiwan's Strait Exchange 
Foundation [SEF], some experts hired by the SEF, as well as 
victims' relatives viewed the fire-damaged boat "Hairui," stolen 
money and articles, and implements which the public security 
organ recovered from the criminals, in Chunan County this

the Association For Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] 
on the Chunan trip. 
  By showing actual things on the "Hairui," the ARATS-hired 
experts answered SEF experts' questions regarding the cause of 
the fire, the direction in which the fire spread, the degree of 
burning, bullet marks made by the hunting rifle, and other 
relevant matters. The SEF personnel and experts then checked 
the crime implements recovered from the three culprits, 
including a motor boat, hunting rifle (rifles), explosives for 
civilian use, and a gasoline container which was left at the 
crime scene; recovered stolen U.S., Hong Kong and other 
currency; and precious metal and jade articles.

  [Text] Chunan, Zhejiang Province, May 11 (XINHUA) -- A 
group sent by the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) 
today visited Chun'an County in Zhejiang Province to inspect the 
site of the Qiandao Lake incident. 
  In the accompany of mainland legal experts invited by the 
mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits 
(ARATS), the group, including Taiwan's legal experts and 
relatives of the victims of the incident, went to see the 
"Hairui" boat and instruments used by suspects in the murder 
case. 
  The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Chun'an 
County on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat and 
the robbery and murder of 32 victims from Taiwan and the 
mainland. Of the dead, 24 were tourists from Taiwan. 
  After the inspection, Shi Hwei-yow, SEF's deputy 
secretary-general, said it is helpful to understand the whole 
incident and to see the scene of the crime. 
  During the two-hour inspection, the SEF group went onto the 
"Hairui", which is docked in the boat-building yard of Chun'an 
County. They reviewed the entire structure of the boat and 
fire damage on the upper, middle and lower cabins. They also 
asked questions about the cause of the fire and how it spread, 
the position of the explosives and the fittings of the boat. 
  The legal experts from the mainland answered the questions 
in 
detail. 
  The SEF group also went to a small house not far away from 
the "Hairui" where the tools of the suspects in the incident and 
their booty were kept, including two hunting rifles, a bag of 
explosives for civilian use, a pail for gasoline, cameras, gold 
and jade trinkets, watches, video tapes, and pictures developed 
from the film in the cameras. 
  The SEF group also inspected the motorboat used by the 
suspects.

  [Text] China's antiterrorism unit has been brought into 
public view for the first time. The secretive government cell 
has been called in to refute rumours that renegade soldiers were 
involved in the massacre of 24 Taiwan tourists in Zhejiang 
province. 
  The Ministry of Public Security unit, which is believed to 
have been set up after the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989, 
has never been officially acknowledged, except, by necessity, in 
confidential international police work. Revealing the unit in 
connection with the boat tragedy apparently reflects the 
seriousness with which Beijing is treating the incident, which 
brought cross-straits relations to their lowest point since the 
late 1980s. 
  He Ting, head of the unit, answered reporters' questions in 
Hangzhou on Monday. He said there was no evidence of army 
accomplices in the tragedy on Qiandao Lake on March 31. "This 
case is 100 percent without any military involvement," he said. 
  A total of nine mainland experts, two of them from the 
Ministry of Public Security in Beijing, are testifying in the 
trial of four suspects in the incident. 
  He Ting's first public appearance has become something of a 
sideshow, with reporters plying him with questions on everything 
from international terrorist groups based in China to attempts 
on the lives of senior Chinese leaders. The antiterrorist unit 
is also in charge of investigating aircraft hijackings. 
According to a report in Ming Pao, one of He Ting's first 
assignments as antiterrorism chief in 1989 was to investigate 
and handle the extradition from Japan of a Hebei Province man 
who claimed political asylum after hijacking a mainland plane to 
Japan. 
  In the five years since then, he has earned a reputation for 
taking a hands-on approach. This included taking charge of an 
armed assault on the hideaway of a gang of heavily-armed bandits 
in the Shanxi capital, Taiyuan.

  [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan representative 
offices in Italy and Sweden have changed their names recently to 
better reflect their functions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
said. 
  Ministry officials said that the representative office in 
Sweden changed its name from the Taipei trade, tourism and 
information office to the Taipei mission in Sweden, while the 
Taipei Cultural and Economic Institute in Italy was renamed the 
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office. 
  The officials said that the renaming of the two 
representative offices is a sign that Taiwan's political and 
economic relations with the two nations have become closer. 
  They said that relations with European nations have been 
improving steadily, noting that Sweden began to issue visas in 
Taiwan last year, becoming the first European nation to do so. 
  The renaming of the Italian office also showed that Italy 
has 
begun to attach greater importance to its ties with Taiwan, they 
said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan will lower tariff 
rates on 244 agricultural items, including vegetables and 
fruits, as part of its bid to join the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Friday 
[13 May]. 
  This is the first time Taiwan has decided to cut tariff 
rates 
on fresh fruits and vegetables, including those which are 
produced in Taiwan, the council said. 
  After the adjustment, the average nominal tariff rate for 
agricultural products will drop to 20.8 percent from the current 
21.6 percent. The adjustment will take effect after being 
approved by the Legislative Yuan, the council said. 
  To minimize the impact on local farmers, COA Vice Chairman 
Lin Shiang-nung said, the tariff cuts will affect items which 
Taiwan does not produce or over which Taiwan boasts a strong 
competitive edge. 
  Lin said tariff rates for veterinary medicines, pesticides, 
fertilizers, feed, farm machinery and raw materials will be 
lowered by greater ranges with a view to helping local farmers 
and food processors cut production costs. 
  Tariff rates for some vegetables and fruits, including 
onion, 
potato, celery, cauliflower, strawberry, kiwi, lemon, orange and 
grapefruit will be reduced by 2-10 percent. "The adjustment 
ranges vary with their `sensitivity' or domestic production 
quantities," Lin said. 
  Customs duty rates for beef, lamb, cod, lobster, small 
shrimp, dry shark's fin and salmon will be cut by 5 to 10 
percent, and those for various kinds of fruit juice will be 
lowered by 5 percent. 
  The proposed tariff reductions are part of draft amendments 
to the country's current tariff regulations passed by the 
Executive Yuan Thursday. 
  The draft amendments propose tariff cuts on a total of 758 
industrial and agricultural products. Industrial products 
subject to tariff reductions include large refrigerators, 
washing machines, typewriters, data processors, fax machines, 
cellular phones, walkie-talkies, and videotape recorders. 
  The draft amendments will soon be sent to the legislature 
for 
deliberation and approval. If all the proposed tariff 
reductions are approved, finance officials said, Taiwan's 
average nominal tariff rate will decline to 8.64 percent from 
the present 8.89 percent, while the real average tariff rate 
will fall to a mere 4.69 percent. 
  The tariff cuts will cost the national coffers an estimated 
NT [New Taiwan] $2.5 billion annually in tariff revenues, the 
officials said. The government previoulsy proposed sweeping 
tariff cuts in 1990, with the adjustments taking effect in 1992.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, May 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan on Thursday [12 May] 
took a major step in opening its insurance market by revising 
the insurance law to put foreign insurers on an equal footing 
with their local counterparts. 
  The Ministry of Finance said Article 22 of the insurance law 
had been eliminated in order to meet requirements set by the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which Taiwan expects to 
join before the year's end. 
  The article stipulated that total stakes of an individual 
insurance firm held by foreigners must not exceed 30 percent of 
the firm's paid-in capital. 
  It is generally believed that this further opening of the 
insurance market will make the already severe competition 
stiffer. 
  At present, 14 American life insurance companies are doing 
business in Taiwan, struggling to take only 4.5 percent of the 
local market share. Only Aetna Life Insurance Co., a division 
of Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. of Hartford, Conn., is believed 
to

  It has been reported that Continental Insurance Co. of New

  [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan will work with 
Southeast Asian countries to increase regional intellectual 
property rights (IPR) protection, the Board of Foreign Trade 
(BOFT) said Friday [13 May]. 
  Taiwan is paying equal attention to consultations on both 
IPR 
protection and agricultural imports as part of its effort to 
join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), BOFT 
officials said. 
  The efforts include exchanges of information and personnel 
between Taiwan and members of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN). 
  Besides IPR protection consultations, the officials said, 
BOFT is seeking bilateral recognition of national laboratories 
and cooperation in product verification and quality control 
certification with ASEAN members. 
  Details of the issues will be further discussed in an 
October 
Asia-Pacific meterology conference to be held in Taipei, BOFT 
said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan will attend the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) 
animals committee meeting scheduled for May 16-18 in Beijing, a 
spokesman for the local green consumers foundation said Thursday 
[12 May]. 
  Foundation Chairman Fang Chien said the Council of 
Agriculture [COA] agreed to attend the meeting after being 
notified by committee Chairman Hank Jenkins, through Fang, that 
he had reached an agreement with mainland Chinese authorities to 
allow Taipei's participation. 
  Beijing had previously said it would not allow Taiwan's 
participation at the meeting, ostensibly because it is not a 
CITES member. 
  Jenkins, a conservation official in the Australian 
Government, said it is important for Taiwan to be present at the 
meeting because issues pertaining to wildlife protection and 
conservation in Taiwan are on the agenda. 
  Both government agencies and private conservation groups in 
Taiwan are hoping to attend the meeting since it will detail the 
future direction of international wildlife management programs, 
Fang said. 
  He said it would have been "unjustifiable" for Taiwan to be 
barred from the meeting, considering CITES has threatened it 
with trade sanctions for its failure to sufficiently stem the 
trade in rhino horn and tiger parts. 
  The COA will be represented by Prof. Li Ling-ling from 
National Taiwan University and Prof. Wang Ing from National 
Normal University at the Beijing meeting. Fang said he would 
also be a member of the Taiwan delegation, along with Ted Ting, 
chairman of the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation, another local 
conservation group. 
  The biennial meeting is a warm-up for the 1994 CITES parties 
meeting, which is scheduled to open in Florida this November.

  [Text] Two former senior government officials were named 
yesterday to offer their expertise on government affairs to 
China's working panel overseeing Hong Kong's 1997 transfer. 
Arthur Garcia, the first ombudsman in Hong Kong, and Wilfred 
Wong Ying-wai, former deputy secretary for civil service, are 
among a group of 13 appointed by the National People's Congress 
Standing Committee to join the 57-member Preliminary Working 
Committee (PWC). 
  The new members include eight from Hong Kong and five from 
the mainland. The total membership of the PWC has been boosted 
to 70, minus Liu Yiu-chu, who had earlier quit. Officials 
earlier promised to increase the membership of the PWC amid 
fierce criticism over its lack of credibility and dearth of 
dissenting views. The new batch of the think-tank, however, 
remains dominated by mainland officials and pro-China figures. 
  The five mainland members come from the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, the local headquarters of Xinhua (the New China 
News Agency) and the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), 
which falls under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Ministry. 
Mainland officials admitted that the expertise of senior 
government officials was desperately needed in their work. "We 
always hope that more former government officials will take 
part. But there are practical difficulties for some," one said. 
  The appointment of Wilfred Wong, who has helped arrange 
private dialogue between serving colleagues in the bureaucracy 
and local officials from Xinhua, is significant. Mr Wong said 
last night that his previous service in the Government would 
help him to give constructive advice to the Chinese Government. 
Mr Garcia, a retired High Court judge who was later named as 
the Commissioner for Administrative Complaints, will offer legal 
advice to the working panel, which has suffered from the 
shortage of legal experts. 
  Although the Hong Kong Government does not allow any civil 
servants to brief PWC members, an Executive Councillor said they 
would not object to Chinese JLG members briefing the panel or 
even letting them read the documents as long as they could be 
kept confidential. 
  Another local legal expert appointed to the panel is Ambrose 
Lau Hon-chuen, who is also convenor of the preparatory committee 
for the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, a political party to be 
launched by the end of next month. Mr Lau said he would 
definitely join the PWC's legal sub-group to help in 
scrutinising existing Hong Kong laws and to bring them in line 
with the Basic Law. 
  Two academics -- Ng Ching-fai, dean of the science faculty 
at 
Baptist College, and Woo Chia-wei, a vice-chancellor of the Hong 
Kong University of Science and Technology -- were also 
appointed. Also included were two businessmen; Paul Cheng 
Ming-fun, an executive committee member of the influential 
Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong, and Philip 
Wong Yu-hong, who represents the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in 
the Legislative Council and is also a member of the New Hong 
Kong Alliance. 
  The publisher of the pro-China Hong Kong Commercial Daily, 
Lee Cho-jat, was also named to sit on the panel. 
  Topping the list of the five mainland members are two 
high-flyers in the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office Zhang Liangdong and Xu Ze -- who were recently promoted 
to head the office's Hong Kong administration department and 
economic department respectively. Mr Zhang and Mr Xu have been 
serving in the secretariat of the PWC since its inception last 
July. 
  Two more local Xinhua officials were also appointed: 
Ulanmulun, a vice-director focusing on economic affairs in Hong 
Kong; and Weng Xinqiao, director of the department of education.

<F P=106> [Article by Legislative Councillor Christine Loh: </F>
"Blinkered Visions"] 
  [Text] Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, told a business audience last week: "There are 
those who believe that only when China turns capitalist that 
Hong Kong's capitalism can be guaranteed. This is an entirely 
wrong concept." With this, I agree. 
  However, Lu's reasoning is incorrect. Hong Kong people want 
to practise capitalism and much more. We also want to enjoy a 
system of representative government, human rights and the rule 
of law. It is precisely because China has an authoritarian 
government and low respect for human rights, and because it 
practises rule by man, that people believe that only when the 
Chinese government becomes less repressive and more democratic 
will Hong Kong's life-style and freedoms be guaranteed. 
  In limiting Hong Kong's desires to capitalism, Lu 
misunderstands the territory. Chinese leaders may believe that 
making money is all Hong Kong people care about and that it is, 
therefore, their reason for wanting to retain the economic 
system beyond 1997. But the leaders are wrong. The "one 
country, two systems" concept also means our social, cultural 
and developing political systems. 
  Lu said on May 6 there would always be a "handful" who 
thought they could "turn Hong Kong into a political city in 
order to influence the mainland in the sense of politics". He 
warned that Hong Kong would then be of "negative value" to 
China. On May 8, Lu clarified that statement to pro-China trade 
unionists, saying Hong Kong should not become a base to convert 
China to democracy. 
  Socialism and democracy are, after all, not mutually 
exclusive, but Chinese leaders are accustomed to authoritarian 
rule. The director really meant that China is hostile to 
democracy in Hong Kong because it fears that democracy might 
spread. Because of this fear, Beijing sees attitudes towards 
democracy in Hong Kong as the dividing line between its friends 
and supposed enemies. Those who are outspoken in their support 
of democracy have already, in effect, been warned that they will 
not he allowed to hold any political office after 1997. They 
are accused of being unpatriotic, even subversive. 
  And perhaps the issue of human rights is also becoming a 
measure of loyalty to the motherland. Human rights serve to 
define the relationship between the government and the governed, 
and to limit the powers of the state over the individual. 
Individual rights are dangerous to Beijing because they promote 
values which make Hong Kong the "political city" that Chinese 
leaders fear. For example, Beijing must find irksome the 
continued support for the release of the Ming Pao reporter, Xi 
Yang, who was jailed for 12 years for allegedly stealing state 
banking secrets. 
  No doubt China's leaders are also beginning to find 
threatening the continued call for a human rights commission in 
Hong Kong. Lu said such a body would contravene the Basic Law 
because it was not set out in the future mini-constitution. 
Perhaps he conveniently forgot that "other special courts" can 
be established. Perhaps a rent tribunal might be more 
acceptable than a human rights version. 
  Lu disputes that Hong Kong people even care about politics. 
He says that if you ask anyone in the street about their 
primary concern, 90 per cent will say their livelihoods. But 
the director misses the point. Concerns for housing, welfare, 
education, the environment, corruption, law and order, and even 
equality of the sexes are highly political issues. 
  The formulation and implementation of public policy in Hong 
Kong is as much about the process as it is about the end 
product. People expect to be consulted each step of the way, 
and they expect important issues to be publicly debated. Hong 
Kong people demanded that the policy-making process should 
become more open. Now, they have also insisted on being given 
enough information to be able to assess policies and to hold the 
executive accountable. 
  It is against this background that Hong Kong wants a more 
representative system of government. And it is this development 
that makes Hong Kong a vibrant political city. This is not the 
work of a "handful" of people, but of all residents of Hong Kong. 
  Lu failed to win the hearts and minds of Hong Kong because 
Beijing does not want to deal with all these views. China's 
united-front strategy cannot cope with opposing views. Until 
this changes, Beijing will continue to pretend that only a 
"handful" have different ideas about how "one country, two 
systems" should work.

<F P=106> ["Off My Chest" column by Neville de Silva from the "Focus" </F>
page: "Lu Ping's Dismal Visit Shows the Heavy Hand of Beijing"] 
  [Text] However much apologists try to colour wash Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Director Lu Ping's visit here to make it 
seem a success, the truth is that he did not endear himself to 
the Hong Kong people. There are those who will airily dismiss 
public opinion polls as of little meaning and significance, 
unless of course such polls tend to buttress their own 
viewpoints. 
  Even if one concedes this, the comments of some considered 
sympathetic to Beijing appear to reflect public displeasure at 
Lu Ping's crass discourtesy in refusing to even say hello to 
Governor Patten. That exhibition of poor taste and even worse 
diplomacy, was compounded by the often contradictory 
explanations offered by Chinese officials and their sycophants 
for Mr Lu's inability to find a few minutes to meet the governor. 
  To add to this dismal performance, Mr Lu's former deputy, 
and 
now Bank of China director Wang Qiren, came up with a puerile 
explanation for not inviting Mr Patten to the note-issuing 
ceremony. It might have been lapped up by sympathetic media, but 
would have sounded silly to anybody with the mental age of even 
a 10-year old. 
  To cap it all, Mr Lu could not find a few minutes to 
formally 
meet the press. Was it because he feared being trapped in their 
own consistencies or was it another instance of Beijing's 
contempt for the Hong Kong people and the value system they 
would like to preserve? 
  Before Mr Lu even set foot in Hong Kong, Chinese officials 
were quick to explain that the director's nine-day itinerary was 
full to the last millisecond. While Chinese officials were 
claiming that a packed programme forbade a visit to Government 
House, the Chinese media proffered its own excuses. Lu Ping was 
like the master and Chris Patten like the caretaker and there 
was no reason for the master to meet the caretaker. 
  Whatever one thinks of the appositeness of that simile--here 
is a caretaker who is not of the master's choosing--the tone 
suggests that Imperial China still lives on in socialist China, 
despite all the Marxist rhetoric about a people's republic and 
other slogans, fast turning into shibboleths under the thrust of 
capitalist economics. The fact is that Mr Lu behaved like a 
petty potentate, a sign surely of the vertically regimented 
political structure he represents. 
  Having first said that a busy schedule prevented Mr Lu from 
meeting Mr Patten, the Chinese then came up with another 
explanation. The governor had not been very friendly towards 
the China-appointed Preliminary Working Committee. That was the 
reason Mr Lu adduced later. In the meantime, there had been 
other explanations from the Chinese as well as their camp 
followers. Given the state of bilateral relations, they said, 
nothing would have been achieved by such a meeting. 
  Some apologists argued that a meeting between Mr Lu and Mr 
Patten was not important. After all, he was coming here to 
attend the PWC meeting and that was the prime concern. Others 
argued that the visit was symbolic, as it showed that Chinese 
officials can come to Hong Kong, talk about Hong Kong, meet with 
Hong Kong people (or a select few) while totally ignoring the 
Hong Kong Government. 
  One might have believed some of these stories had Mr Lu's 
busy schedule been jampacked with discussions with the PWC. How 
much of his time here was really spent at PWC meetings and how 
much of it talking to the business community, to pro-China trade 
unions, closeted with Xinhua officials and other pro-China 
elements? 
  Why wasn't Mr Patten invited to the Bank of China ceremony? 
Because the organisers thought that the governor would be too 
busy. This excuse is both stupid and crude. Perhaps it is 
another sign of the condescending attitude of Beijing officials 
to the Hong Kong people? 
  What is more, Mr Lu publicly issued a political message just 
as Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and Sir Percy Cradock had done 
before him. The real significance of all this has, 
unfortunately, escaped attention. Mr Lu or Mr Lee can speak 
their minds freely in Hong Kong, even criticise the chief 
executive publicly. 
  Will this still be possible three years or so from now? 
Apart from foreign visitors coming here and talking openly, 
will the Hong Kong people themselves be able to do so without 
being branded as subversives and possibly incarcerated? Will 
even the media be able to discuss issues freely, seeing how 
China reacted the other day to protesting Hong Kong journalists? 
  That is the question Hong Kong people should ask themselves. 
Lu Ping has done little to stem the growing belief that the 
concept of "one country, two systems" is nothing more than a 
high-faluting slogan. Rather, he strengthened fears that the 
essence of Hong Kong's life style will be slowly crushed by the 
juggernaut of Beijing authoritarianism.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Hong Wen (3126 2429): "Experts Say If China's </F>
MFN Status Is Revoked, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Foreign-funded 
Enterprises Will Suffer Most"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 12 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Whether 
or not China's most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment will be 
renewed will be announced in a couple of weeks. Economic 
experts point out that if this treatment is withdrawn, it goes 
without saying that both China and the United States will suffer 
losses. However, those who will really suffer most will be the 
Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign investors who have set up 
production bases on the mainland. That is why these experts 
predict that if the United States genuinely has its eyes on a 
development strategy in the Asia region, it will certainly not 
revoke China's MFN status rashly. 
  Dr. Chen Wen-hung, director of the China Business Center at 
the Hong Kong Polytechnic, told this reporter that the trade 
dispute between China and the United States is, in the final 
analysis, a trade balance issue. However, the principal 
beneficiary is not China, but foreign investors who open 
factories on the mainland and export their products to the 
United States using the mainland's export quotas. Most of them 
are manufacturers from Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  According to the press, the net export value of Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, and other foreign-invested enterprises increased 
substantially by 45 percent in 1993, which accounted for nearly 
28 percent of the country's total export value. It is 
anticipated that this proportion will rise to 40 percent this 
year. Chen Wen-hung pointed out that China's export growth last 
year was basically achieved by relying on foreign-invested 
enterprises. Hence, he believes that if China loses its MFN 
status, Hong Kong and Taiwan investors will suffer most. 
  According to a World Bank estimate, if the United States 
revokes MFN status for China, the volume of Chinese manufactured 
goods exported to the United States will fall by 25 to 50 
percent. These are mostly goods produced in mainland China by 
Hong Kong and Taiwan manufacturers. A report from the Hong Kong 
Trade Department shows that, under these circumstances, China's 
re-export volume to the United States through Hong Kong will 
fall by 33 to 46 percent, and Hong Kong profits amounting to 
$2.4 to $3.4 billion will be lost. As a result, Hong Kong's 
economic growth rate, which has previously been estimated at 5 
percent, will be reduced by 2.2 percentage points to 3 percent. 
According to an analysis of Tang Ying-yen, vice chairman of the 
Federation of Hong Kong Industries, calculated on a per-capita 
basis, Hong Kong will sustain the heaviest blow. 
  As regards Taiwan, according to Taiwan customs statistics, 
the proportion of re-export trade between both sides of the 
strait in terms of Taiwan's total foreign trade has risen by 2 
percent annually in recent years. Li Chien, managing director 
of the Hong Kong Taipei Trade Center, said that most of 
re-export goods were industrial raw materials, components, 
accessories, and so on, a considerable proportion of which are 
re-exported to foreign countries after being processed in 
mainland China. Among the 100 largest enterprise groups in 
Taiwan, nearly 60 of have invested or plan to invest in the 
mainland. 
  In view of the extremely serious impact on Hong Kong and 
Taiwan because of the issue of China's MFN status, relevant 
experts believe that in consideration of political and economic 
factors, the United States, which has shifted its strategic 
focus to Asia, will certainly not revoke China's MFN status 
rashly.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- When answering a 
reporter's questions today, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Wu Jianmin said: The attitude expressed by Japanese Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata in his oral message to Premier Li Peng on 
his determination to prevent past unfortunate history from being 
repeated is "sensible." 
  At today's news conference, a reporter asked: Has the 
Chinese side received Prime Minister Hata's letter to Chinese 
leaders? Does the Chinese side have any comments on Prime 
Minister Hata's letter and on his inaugural address? 
  Wu Jianmin said: Japanese Ambassador to China Kunihiro 
Michihiko conveyed to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan 
on 10 May an oral message from Prime Minister Hata to Premier Li 
Peng on the remarks made by former Japanese Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano in which Nagano distorted the history of Japanese 
aggression against China. We have noticed Prime Minister Hata's 
profound introspection concerning Japan's past aggression and 
colonial rule that inflicted unbearable suffering on many 
peoples. He indicated that past history shall be treated 
correctly and that the young generation shall be educated with 
the correct historical views. He is also determined to prevent 
the past unfortunate history from being repeated. 
  Wu Jianmin said: "We believe Prime Minister Hata's attitude 
is sensible and is in accordance with the trend of history, and 
we appreciate his attitude."

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- At a meeting with 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir at the Diaoyutai State 
Guesthouse this afternoon, President Jiang Zemin stressed the 
importance of stability, saying China's stability is not only 
requisite for its own development, but will also benefit the 
stability and prosperity of Asia and the world in general. 
  In the meeting, the Chinese president and the Malaysian 
prime 
minister said they were delighted at seeing each other again. 
Jiang Zemin said: "Your Excellency's second visit to China 
coincides with the 20th anniversary of the establishment of 
Sino-Malaysian diplomatic relations. Bilateral ties have gained 
overall expansion in the past two decades, with fruitful 
cooperation in the political, economic, science and technology, 
and cultural fields. The traditional friendship between the 
Chinese and Malaysian peoples continues to expand, while vast 
potential exists for bilateral cooperation." He added: 
"Continuous expansion of such relations will not only promote 
common prosperity of the two countries, but will also serve to 
enhance regional economic cooperation." 
  The Chinese president said: "Your Excellency remarked during 
the visit to China last year that political stability is an 
important factor for economic development. This makes a lot of 
sense and we have good knowledge about that. China needs 
stability, and so does Asia and the world in general. This is a 
crucially important issue. Looking in retrospect at the 
political disturbance between the spring and summer of 1989, if 
resolute measures were not taken then, China would not enjoy 
today's stability. A bad thing has been turned into a good 
thing, and as a result, our reform and opening program has 
forged ahead with steadier, better, and even quicker steps, and 
our advantages have been brought into fuller play." History 
shows that anything conducive to our national stability is good. 
In the past five years, China has enjoyed economic development, 
social stability, and the improved livelihood of the people, 
thanks to our consistent efforts to take stability as an 
overriding priority. Facts prove this is absolutely correct. 
  Jiang Zemin emphasized: Stability forms a prerequisite and 
reform serves as a driving force, while development represents 
the goal. The three factors interact to promote each other. 
The importance of ensuring lasting national stability has 
become a common understanding of all the Chinese people. The 
stability of China is not only needed for China's own 
development, but will also benefit the stability and prosperity 
of Asia and the world in general. That is because the stability 
of China, a big country with a close to 1.2 billion population, 
is of international significance. In the past decade and more, 
the stability and development of China has not only brought 
benefits to its own people, but contributed to world peace and 
development as well. 
  On the regional situation, Jiang Zemin noted: The current 
situation in Asia is generally good, with relative political 
stability, sustained economic development, and constantly 
improving regional security. Further efforts to safeguard and 
promote regional peace and development reflect an issue that has 
won attention from leaders of Asian nations. He said: "We are 
ready to work with Malaysia and other Asian countries towards 
peace and development in Asia." 
  Mahathir said: Since the visit to China last year, he has 
been encouraging Malaysian businessmen to invest in and expand 
trade with China. Malaysia is satisfied with the steady growth 
of economic and trade ties with China. 
  The Malaysian prime minister also told Jiang Zemin that 
during his meeting with U.S. President Clinton shortly before he 
came to China, he stressed his opposition to imposing one's own 
views upon others and to using the issue of Most-Favored-Nation 
trading status to exert pressure on China. 
  According to a Foreign Ministry spokesman, the meeting 
proceeded in a cordial and friendly atmosphere. Vice Foreign 
Minister Tang Jiaxuan, assistant to the minister Wang Yinggan, 
and Malaysian Ambassador to China Adenan [name as received] were 
present at the meeting. 
  After the meeting, Jiang hosted a banquet in honor of 
Mahathir and his party.

  Wu continued that despite the breakdown of the Sino-British 
talks on arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections, the 
Chinese side, proceeding from the livelihood and economy of Hong 
Kong, is still willing to cooperate with the British side. Of 
course, whether cooperation between the two sides is smooth 
depends on the British side. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- China has caught up with 
the world's developed countries in the technology and industrial 
application of slurry, a new coal-based clean fuel. 
  Hao Fengyin, chairman of the National Research Center of 
Slurry Engineering and Technology, said that although China has 
been late in starting research in this field, it has developed 
its own set of technologies. 
  Slurry, composed of 60-70 percent of coal, 30-40 percent of 
water, and some one percent of additives to keep the mixture 
stable and fluid, is believed to be a good substitute for fuel 
oil. 
  The technology of slurry was born during the world oil 
crisis 
in the 1970s. The United States, Italy, Japan, Sweden and the 
Soviet Union invested large amounts of money and technical force 
in its research and development. 
  The Chinese Government showed interest in exploiting and 
using slurry to supplant oil, which was falling short of demand, 
and listed slurry technology as one of the key projects for 
research in the three consecutive "five-year plans" starting 
from 1980. 
  During 1985-90, China succeeded in completing research of 
slurry, developed a complete set of technologies and built 
demonstration projects and bases for experimenting with slurry 
preparation, pipeline transportation and industry-oriented 
combustion. 
  Since 1990, the state has approved five energy-saving and 
environmentally sound projects using slurry instead of oil, 
bringing to a new stage the large-scale, streamlined industrial 
application of slurry technology. 
  At present, six slurry preparation plants have been built in 
China, with their annual production capacity totaling one 
million tons. Specialized workshops can produce 500 to 2,000 
tons of slurry additives, with only two-thirds, or even half, 
the cost of their foreign equivalents. 
  Breakthroughs were also made in slurry combustion for 
industrial scale boilers and kilns and power plant boilers, 
slurry storage and transportation and research and development 
of specific equipment. 
  Hao said China is developing second-generation slurry 
technology, including preparation of super-low ash slurry and 
intensified low- sulphur combustion, which has attracted the 
attention of foreign counterparts. 
  It is estimated that by the end of this century, China's 
slurry production will replace 10 million tons of fuel oil and 
the capacity of pipeline transport will reach 30 million tons. 
  Hao said this will not only help ease the congestion of rail 
transportation, but also greatly reduce the emission of ash and 
other pollutants into the atmosphere. 
  China is rich in coal deposits as against oil resources, Hao 
said. Coal accounts for more than 75 percent of the country's 
consumption of primary sources of energy. "It is imperative to 
put the slurry technology into full play, so as to attract more 
clients, domestic and foreign," he added. 
  He proposed that a high-tech coal processing conglomerate be 
established based on the national research center to undertake 
large-sized projects in and outside China. 
  He also expressed China's willingness to develop 
international cooperation, from the pure technological type to 
an all-around one incorporating technology, industry and trade. 
  This would pave the way for China's slurry technology and 
products to enter world markets, he added.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] In a show of force triggering memories of the 
Tiananmen Square massacre, six People's Liberation Army trucks 
roared through Beijing's centre yesterday. The convoy of 
trucks, each carrying about 50 soldiers from the Beijing 
Military Region, was indicative of the Army's heightened profile 
around the capital ahead of the fifth anniversary of the June 4 
massacre. 
  Troop trucks and other army vehicles have been sighted in 
increasing numbers over the past two weeks, particularly in 
Beijing's northwestern university district, but yesterday's 
daylight procession past the China World Trade Centre was 
perhaps the most blatant demonstration of the military's 
presence so far. "They did not seem to be armed but it was 
still a little scary," said an office worker at the World Trade 
Centre who watched the convoy pass. "I hadn't seen anything like 
that since 1989. It was weird." 
  But despite the Army's higher profile, military analysts 
said 
there was little to suggest that troop numbers actually had 
increased in the capital over the past few months. The Army 
maintains about 50,000 troops in the Beijing Municipal District. 
  Likewise, the People's Armed Police (PAP), which has between 
30,000 and 50,000 officers in Beijing, does not appear to have 
acquired reinforcements in the past couple of months. "I think 
they are just trying to let the people know they are there and 
that no one should try anything stupid in the run-up to the 
(June 4) anniversary," a Western military attache said. "The 
number of military and PAP troops in Beijing at the moment 
should be enough to handle any disturbance.

<F P=106> ["Marching Toward the Modern Enterprise System" column, by </F>
staff reporter Wu Changsheng (0702 7022 3932): "The Market 
Calls for a New Role--Reports on Comprehensive Reforms Carried 
Out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation (first 
installment)"] 
  [Text] Editor's Note: Clearing Our Thoughts, Doing 
Things Discreetly 
  Beginning today, a series of reports will be published in 
this newspaper on the comprehensive reforms carried out by the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. The corporation's 
reforms and exploration are still in progress and its experience 
is only preliminary. The main reason for a series of reports to 
be published on it is that we want the reading public to more 
thoroughly understand the basic train of thought of the 
corporation's reform. It would never be our aim to encourage 
everyone simply to copy the corporation without paying any 
attention to his own conditions, neither do we intend to 
popularize the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as a 
so-called "model." Since different localities have different 
conditions, the exploration of reform can be and should be 
varied, but a common point of departure must be grasped firmly, 
which is to develop and strengthen the state-owned economy and 
to ensure that the value of state-owned assets can be maintained 
and increased. This is also the basic point of the reform 
experience of Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. 
  Once the train of thought of reform is determined, concrete 
work must be done in a safe and discreet manner. Strategic 
considerations are not tantamount to tactical operations. 
Negative effects may be brought about if one stresses only good 
wishes while doing one's work, but disregards the peculiarities 
of the time and the situation. For example, we can never take 
the flexible use of assets as simply the reorientation of land 
use; neither can we set off another upsurge of real estate 
development in the name of learning from the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation. State-owned assets cover a very wide 
range, and land is only a very small part. 
  Shortage of funds, overabundance of personnel, and rigid 
asset application are the three problems generally being 
encountered by state-owned enterprises at present. Under the 
guidance of Comrade Xiaoping's southern-tour remarks and the 
spirit of the 14th Party Congress, the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation proceeded from reality to blaze a new 
trail of comprehensive reforms in asset appreciation, 
transformation of industries, transformation of functions, 
transformation of the mechanism, and transfer of workers and 
staff to other work units, thus finding the key to solving these 
three problems. 
  According to comrades of the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation, rigid asset application is the knot of the three 
problems, and the others can be solved readily once this knot is 
untied. Therefore, although many aspects are involved in the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation's reform, the 
enterprise ownership reform remains its nucleus. 
  How did they untie the knot? What kind of key did they find? 
We will publish four reports to answer these questions one by 
one. Our reporters still found it interesting to address the 
issue after finishing four reports on it. Hence, we will 
publish a fifth report, in which the reporter and people 
concerned will speak on what we actually get from the reforms 
carried out by the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. 
Of course, the reading public is very welcome to discuss this 
with us. [end editor's note] 
  "The starting point of the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation is not a premeditated scheme, but practice. Up to 
now, they have taken an entirely step-by-step approach to work." 
  -- Opening remarks made by a comrade of the Beijing First 
Light Industrial Corporation who was familiar with the whole 
process of systematic reform 
  In a football game, "offside" means breaking the rules. 
In order to find a way out for the enterprise, the Beijing 
First Light Industrial Corporation was unconsciously on the 
"offside"--turning its attention from dealing with products to 
dealing with state-owned assets. A fortuitous "offside" made an 
impact on the whole system. 
  State-owned enterprises abstain from talking about "death," 
and so did the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation. 
Although the Bankruptcy Law was introduced several years ago, 
and the idea of "euthanasia" is accepted by more and more 
people, after all, owing to environmental limitations, only a 
few enterprises have resorted to "euthanasia." Many enterprises 
originally thinking of an "easy death" often give up the idea 
because they "cannot bear such a death" and they are still 
bitterly fighting for their "mere existence." 
  To our surprise, however, the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation miraculously and quietly "died" in the past two 
years or so, without causing any sloppiness or trouble. 
  The first case in point was the former Beijing No. 2 
Eyeglasses Plant. From 1984 on, faced with increasingly fierce 
market competition, the plant failed again and again. In 1991, 
the capacity utilization rate was less than 30 percent, the 
annual per capita income of workers and staff was a mere 2,400 
yuan, and the plant's deficits accumulated to 1.2 million yuan. 
At the same time, hundreds of individual household traders 
emerged around there who were running eyeglasses industries and 
processing eyeglasses, and their business was good. After 
conscientiously weighing the pros and cons, the plant decided to 
"transfer" from the "secondary industry" to "tertiary industry." 
With the support of industrial and commercial departments, in 
August 1991, the Beijing No. 2 Eyeglasses Plant was transformed 
into a specialized eyeglasses wholesale market with over 500 
stalls, which attracted not only numerous individual household 
traders in the area, but foreign businessmen as well. The 
annual turnover reached 130 million yuan, which not only offset 
the enterprise's deficits, but reaped more than 1 million yuan 
of profits. Former staff and workers changed their occupations 
and acted as security guards, cleaners, and transport personnel, 
and the annual per capita income almost doubled. Last year, the 
Beijing No. 1 Eyeglasses Plant -- an "associate" of the Beijing 
No. 2 Eyeglasses Plant which also was running in the red -- was 
incorporated into the eyeglasses market. The largest eyeglasses 
center in our country will be built here. 
  The second case was that of the No. 1 Branch Factory of 
the Beijing Lighting Equipment Company. From 1988 onward, this 
factory -- which produced traditional lamps for civilian, 
industrial, and mining use -- was in a predicament. In 1991, it 
incurred more than 500,000 yuan in deficits. The company took 
notice of the superiority of the No. 1 Branch Factory's 
location, in the bustling Xizhimen section, and decided to 
rebuild it into a commercial building that would specialize in 
selling communications equipment. In August 1992, the building 
opened for business. Although it was owned by the state, the 
business was privately run and contracted by staff and workers. 
In consequence, it reaped 160,000 yuan in profits in 1992 and 
over 2 million yuan the following year. 
  The third case was that of the Beijing Lamp Factory. Owing 
to its running in the red and incurring debts year after year, 
the factory was incorporated into the Xinhai Instrument Company 
in September 1992. The lamp factory's former main production 
building was rebuilt into the Caishikou Xinguang Commercial 
Building, of which some floors were leased, while some others 
were used by the company for sales of instruments and lamps. 
Last year, the commercial building reaped more than 700,000 
yuan in profits and the income of staff and workers increased by 
over 40 percent. Most of the staff and workers were transferred 
to a piano plant that was short of labor. In consequence, the 
piano plant was able quickly to expand its scale of production 
and increase its output, profits, and taxes. 
  Viewed from the product angle, these factories -- as 
enterprises manufacturing certain kinds of light industrial 
products -- really are "dead," and they have been removed from 
the "roll" of secondary industry. Viewed from the enterprise 
angle, they are still open for business, and their staff and 
workers are still working and being paid because, even though 
the "secondary industry" is dead, the "tertiary industry" was 
born. Viewed from the angle of assets, state-owned assets -- 
which are created by state investment -- are neither dead nor 
lost, but reinvigorated with their value greatly increased! 
  All these things are neither readjustment of the product 
structure nor simply industrial transformation, but indicate a 
kind of change in nature -- breaking through the barriers of 
products and industries, and achieving a transformation from the 
running of a certain kind of products to the running of 
state-owned assets. Although the transformation was started 
unconsciously and at a time when the goal of socialist market 
economic reform had not been clearly fixed, real actions were 
taken, and they have successfully redistributed resources while 
standing in the commanding position of running the main body of 
assets and following the market course. 
  This kind of unconscious "offside" practice has not only 
reshaped the enterprises' external images and transformed their 
internal mechanism, but more important, has had a huge impact on 
the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation as a whole. 
  An "offside" is often the starting point of reform. 
When people are aware of the fact that an "offside" precisely 
fills the "gap" of owners (representatives) of state-owned 
assets, "filling the gap" will become a strong voluntary 
demand. 
  The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, which was 
formed and departmentalized according to product categories 
during the planned-economy period, once scored brilliant 
achievements. Not to mention the "three renowned pieces" -- 
watches, bicycles, and sewing machines -- which were popular, 
personnel of the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation are 
really proud of the fact that the "Beibingyang" soft drink and 
"Hongxing" sorghum spirits monopolized the capital's market for 
a long time. 
  After the policy of reform and opening up was started, 
however, the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation came 
across the problems generally encountered by state-owned 
enterprises. Moreover, the corporation was faced with more and 
more special problems: Small production scale, obsolete 
equipment, overabundance of personnel, and low-technology 
products. In consequence, the corporation failed again and 
again because it could hardly adapt itself to the intense market 
competition. The most distressing problem was that owing to the 
expansion of urban districts, many factories that lay between 
residential and commercial districts became annoyances and were 
urgently required to move elsewhere. However, there simply was 
no way to raise 1.5 billion yuan for moving expenses. Up to the 
early 1990's, 30 percent of the more than 120 enterprises under 
the Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation were in the red, 
and products manufactured by over 35 percent of these 
enterprises were unsalable. From 1990 to 1992, the whole 
corporation earned fewer and fewer profits, which dropped from 
110 million yuan to 90 million yuan and then to just over 60 
million yuan. 
  As a matter of fact, like all other state-owned enterprises 
in the last decade or so, the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation also made constant progress by following the general 
trend of reform. It delegated power to lower levels and let 
them retain a proportion of profits, changed profits into taxes, 
implemented the contract responsibility system, and put the 
Regulations into effect, without missing any single link. All 
of these reforms played a positive part in promoting the 
development of the enterprises, and a small number of the 
enterprises still were faring quite well. We should say that 
without implementing these reform measures, the Beijing First 
Light Industrial Corporation certainly would have encountered 
many more difficulties than it did. As far as the whole body is 
concerned, however, the situation of the Beijing First Light 
Industrial Corporation was becoming more and more grimm. By 
drawing on the experience of coastal areas and by 
conscientiously analyzing the situation of the enterprises under 
the corporation after Comrade Xiaoping had made his 
southern-tour remarks in 1992, the decision-makers at the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation concluded: 
Objectively speaking, the corporation was being surrounded by 
five "circles" -- joint-venture enterprises, town and township 
enterprises, enterprises in special economic zones, civilian-run 
enterprises, and import goods -- and subjectively speaking, the 
corporation was still fettered by five shackles -- the petty 
production concept, the influence of "leftist" ideology, the 
sluggish transformation of government functions, the ossified 
administrative system, and an inflexible operational mechanism. 
In addition, the corporation bore three heavy burdens 
--overabundance of personnel, shortage of funds, and 
difficulties in making an inventory of assets. 
  Where does the crux of this situation lie? -- Sluggish 
reform. A vertical view shows that in the past, the Beijing 
First Light Industrial Corporation based its reform primarily on 
improving a single type of product, to the benefit of a single 
enterprise, but nothing was done explicitly to set a goal for 
preserving and heightening the value of state-owned assets. 
Moreover, its enterprises did not have the right to manage the 
assets and they need not and could not flexibly distribute 
resources within a wider scope in light of changes in market 
demand, hence its enterprises could not sustain deficits once 
incurred. As far as the ultimate ownership is concerned, the 
assets of these enterprises belong to the state, a fact that is 
never ambiguous, but in reality, it is very difficult for the 
state to be concretely in charge of each of the enterprises, 
thus giving rise to the phenomenon of a "gap" in the main body 
of ownership. Filling the "gap" has become a task of paramount 
importance in deepening the reform of state-owned enterprises. 
One of the important factors accounting for stronger vitality 
of joint-venture, private, and stockholding enterprises is 
precisely the availability of ownership representatives, and 
basically, the nonexistence of the nominal post of "person-in 
charge." A lateral view shows that past reform attached 
importance to making a breakthrough in a single area while 
neglecting the importance of promoting corresponding progress in 
other areas, hence the short-term effect was prominent, but 
after some time, the effect gradually faded and the reform was 
subject to various limitations. The market is ruthless, and 
market competition at present is, in reality, a competition of 
reform. Anyone who is sluggish in reform will become passive 
and may be thrown out of the market, which is developing at a 
high speed! This is the truth proven by innumerable facts. 
  Reform must be deepened vigorously! Reform must be 
promoted in a comprehensive manner! At a moment when its fate 
hung in the balance, the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation had no retreat, but could only make this choice. 
How to make things work, however, is a very realistic 
problem. 
  Some people suggested that the 120 or so enterprises could 
part company with each other and each seek its own way out. 
However, as proven by practice, this method will not work. 
Some enterprises can "fight their way out of the heavy 
encirclement," but owing to different bases and qualities, a 
considerable number of enterprises still, just as in the past 
several years, will be in a state of not knowing whether they 
can survive or not, and it is inevitable that they will blindly 
readjust their structure, thus causing great losses to the 
Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, which is a 
state-owned asset. As far as comprehensive reform is concerned, 
it is impossible for any single enterprise to accomplish it. 
Not to mention other problems, under the present circumstances 
in which the social security system is not yet perfect, the mere 
existence of several tens of thousands of personnel seeking 
reemployment and over 20,000 retired staff and workers is 
sufficient to have quite a large impact on social stability. 
  Could all the work be handled and administered entirely by 
the municipal government? Such a practice does not accord with 
the reform orientation of separating the functions and 
responsibilities of administration from those of management, and 
in reality, this will not work. In the past several decades, 
the government has played a role of chief factory director 
bearing "unlimited responsibilities." The conclusion was 
reached long ago in history: Facing the volatile market and tens 
of thousands of enterprises, the government cannot and does not 
have the strength to handle all the work. 
  The Beijing First Light Industrial Corporation, with 
billions 
in state-owned assets, had an urgent need for a genuine 
"person-in-charge," and the corporation's more than 100 
enterprises were eager to have an "operator" to coordinate their 
comprehensive reform. It was precisely under such circumstances 
that a new role mounted the great stage of the market economy, 
and the first company in Beijing for the management of 
state-owned assets -- the Beijing First Light Industrial 
Corporation -- emerged as required by the times!

<F P=106> ["Marching Toward the Modern Enterprise System" column by </F>
staff reporter Zhu Jianhong (2612 0494 4767): "Hongyun Company 
Builds the Bridge -- Series of Reports on Comprehensive Reforms 
Carried Out by Beijing No. 1 Light Industrial Corporation (Third 
Installment)"-- first paragraph is editor's note] 
  [Text] Editor's note: If the previous installments of 
this series, namely, the first installment, "The Market Calls 
for a New Role," and the second installment, "Molding Oneself 
According to the Owner's Demands," focused on introducing the 
mental approach of Beijing No. 1 Light Industrial Corporation 
[BLIC] to reforms, the following installment concentrates on 
explaining in specific terms how they operate. Reforms require 
inputs. The "Hongyun" Company is a "starter [qi dong qi 0796 
0520 0892]" of the BLIC for pooling input funds. With the 
special powers vested in it by the higher authorities, Hongyun 
gave play to the corporation's advantage in available resources 
in accordance with Beijing's urban master plan and the state 
industrial policy, thus allowing the re-exploitation of the 
BLIC's stock assets. Within six months, the "starter" activated 
the entire BLIC community. With the BLIC's change of 
identity, a definite goal came to be seen, i.e., ensuring the 
increasing value of state assets. 
  Increasing value is possible only when the assets are 
in active operation. For assets to be adjusted from an idle 
state to an active state, inputs of capital are needed. Among 
the three major difficulties facing state enterprises, "lack of 
money" is a key problem. The BLIC used a weapon unique to the 
market economy, namely, the joint-stock system, and activated 
management of state assets. 
  Before this, in fact, they had thought about how to make 
state assets active and had taken action accordingly. 
  A large work force, a small amount of money, and an asset 
stock that was hard to activate were like three mountains 
pressing on the BLIC, making it hard to breathe. The most 
important inspiration they drew from Deng Xiaoping's remarks in 
South China in 1992 was that they must make efforts to 
emancipate their minds and change concepts, choose the right 
point of breakthrough, and break out of confinements. 
  They looked back and reviewed a series of past reform 
explorations which had somewhat stepped beyond prescribed limits: 
  Beijing No. 3 Glass Factory used to operate in a busy 
downtown area and caused pollution and disturbance to residents. 
It was only after it received foreign investment through equity 
participation that it could move from the downtown area to 
outside the city's No. 4 Beltway and embarked on a new phase of 
development from a high starting point. 
  Beijing No. 2 Spectacles Factory stopped producing glasses 
and started doing business in the optical market . By doing so, 
it not only adjusted its industrial line according to the 
orientation of the market, but also materialized differential 
earnings from land [tu di ji cha xiao yi 0960 0966 4787 1567 
2400 4135]. 
  Beijing Lighting Equipment Factory also adjusted its 
structure according to the orientation of the market, 
revitalizing itself and achieving the optimal disposition of its 
assets.... 
  Judged by the old standards, a large work force and numerous 
enterprises making little profit or at a loss were all burdens 
that were hard to get rid of. However, when viewed from a 
different angle, the stock assets of the BLIC are actually an 
enormous pool of resources. They had 56 enterprises within and 
along the No. 3 Beltway in Beijing, occupying a total of 1.3 
million square meters of land. Once exploited, these resources 
would make an inestimable contribution to changing BLIC's 
situation when the development and renovation of Beijing reached 
a high tide. The BLIC drew up a new development strategy: 
backing away from the secondary and entering the tertiary, 
i.e., conducting industrial transfers on urban enterprises 
engaged in secondary industry in order of priority to exploit 
differential earnings from land and develop tertiary industry; 
and moving beyond the No. 4 and entering the secondary, i.e., 
moving production elements transferred from the urban area to 
outside the No. 4 Beltway in accordance with state industrial 
policy and the urban development master plan and developing 
secondary industry on a high basis. 
  This is a major example of industrial transfer executed by 
way of the re-exploitation of assets. The number one task was 
to put capital into circulation. 
  Methods of financing are many, but not for BLIC. BLIC at 
that time was a nominal enterprise, which was in fact merely an 
administrative organ without the authority to extend credit. 
Funding from the government was for the purpose of sustaining 
the corporation's administrative operations. Therefore, they 
had to resort to different channels of financing. They chose 
the mode of a limited liability company and raised large amounts 
of money from society at large by setting up joint-stock 
companies and obtaining the capital funds for the ongoing 
exploitation [gun dong kai fa 3340 0520 7030 4099] of assets. 
  In July 1993, Beijing Hongyun Property Company Limited, 
which is held by BLIC, was founded by "special approval." The 
capital stock of Hongyun was 150 million yuan. Of this capital 
stock, 135 million yuan comprised corporate shares, of which 110 
million yuan was subscribed by the five promoters. In addition, 
25 million yuan was raised from designated legal persons from 
society at large and internal staff shares were worth 15 million 
yuan. In this way, the Hongyun Company managed to raise a total 
of 190 million yuan. 
  "Money spent should buy in a new mechanism." If the 
Hongyun Company had not faced the market but had continued to 
operate in the mode of administrative management, the bridge it 
had built would not have led BLIC toward the modern enterprise 
system. 
  The Hongyun Company is a product of the market economy. It 
was incorporated under the rules of a market economy and the 
degree of standardization in this company was fully affirmed by 
relevant personalities. 
  In enlivening the state asset stock of BLIC as a whole, the 
Hongyun Company undertook the heavy responsibility of raising 
starter funds, implementing industrial transfer through ongoing 
exploitation, and accomplishing the re-exploitation of existing 
assets. To cater to this special mission, the municipal 
government decided to grant the Hongyun Company the right to 
(general) real estate development. In other words, the Hongyun 
Company could develop real estate in all BLIC enterprises and 
was authorized to transform parts of the urban area in complete 
plots. 
  This economic entity, carrying the mission of activating 
state assets, began to operate by the rules of the market 
economy. 
  The first project was the Beijing Match Factory. It was 
located in Beijing's Chongwen District, occupying 47,000 square 
meters of land. It had a work force of 868, with 500 retired 
workers. Heavy burdens and high operating costs caused the 
enterprises to suffer high production costs and low profits. It 
had started to operate at a loss in the first half of 1993. In 
the process of transformation planned according to the new 
approach, the factory was first moved outside the No. 4 Beltway 
and a new match factory operating under the joint-stock system 
was set up in conjunction with Tongxian County. Because a new 
operational mechanism was used, the work force was streamlined 
to about 300 and, in the meantime, a large number of contract 
workers were recruited, taking advantage of inexpensive labor 
from suburban counties. In the middle of February 1994, the new 
factory went into trial operation and the estimated profit rate 
for the whole year will be over 10 percent. On the site of the 
old match factory, the construction of a residential 
subdistrict, with a total floor space of over 120,000 square 
meters, began at the end of last year. The whole project will 
be completed in about two years. The total investment is 273 
million yuan and income from sales will reach 344 million yuan. 
  The transformation of the match factory was a big success, 
as 
well as a big sensation. A lossmaker had disappeared and, in 
its place, a new-type enterprise and a large tract of high-value 
property had been born. That is why Fu Lin [0265 2651], the 
director of the old match factory, vividly described the 
metamorphosis of his enterprise as "experiencing a rewarding 
death." Society's comment on this example was: "Move one spot, 
enliven the whole area." 
  In less than a year since it started operating, the Hongyun 
Company has displayed extremely strong vitality: 
  --It has completed the investigation of 32 BLIC enterprises 
located within the bounds of the No. 3 Beltway. Their 
properties have been reappraised and the results show that they 
occupy a total of 1.008 million square meters of land. 
According to Beijing's urban development plan, this amount of 
land can be redeveloped into 3 million square meters of 
commercial and residential floor space worth about 18.3 billion 
yuan and generating an estimated profit of 4.5 billion yuan. 
  --Three projects, including the match factory project, have 
been started, with the total floor space under construction 
being 170,000 square meters. Returns had been quite handsome by 
the end of last year and shareholders are expected to receive 
satisfactory dividends. 
  --It has pre-injected 87 million yuan of project funds into 
such enterprises as a battery factory, a light bulb factory, a 
general winery, a glass company, and the No. 1 Foodstuffs 
Company. This move has not only helped relieve a shortage of 
working capital in these enterprises, but has also laid the 
foundation for the development of future projects. 
  The Hongyun Company's investments are extensive. Besides 
real estate development carried out in conjunction with the 
industrial transfers in its sector, it has also started equity 
participation in other fields. So far, the value of its equity 
investments in commercial circulation enterprises, the garment 
industry, real estate, and exchange markets has reached 20 
million yuan. According to Li Xiaohong [7812 2556 1347], 
general manager of the Hongyun Company, the company's investment 
policy is: Invest in various fields, extend feelers in various 
directions, and establish many fulcra to distribute investment 
risks, adjust the orientation of operations whenever necessary, 
obtain market information, converge with domestic and 
international markets, and strive for stable returns. 
  There are similarities and differences between the Hongyun 
Company's behavior and that of ordinary joint-stock companies. 
The similarities are that they operate in the same market 
environment, have decision-making powers in operations, and are 
developing their business according to the orientation of the 
market. Differences are that the Hongyun Company shoulders the 
heavy responsibility of activating state assets in a whole 
sector and in the meantime also has unshirkable social 
responsibility; therefore, it has secured government support and 
enjoys advantages in resources that ordinary companies do not 
have. 
  Because of this special role that the Hongyun Company plays, 
BLIC sees itself as a starter for managing state assets and, 
relying on the strength of the market, uses it to transform the 
old system bit by bit with the new system, activate the 
reorganization of stock assets according to market orientation 
with new development in a step-by-step way, and eventually reach 
the goal of activating all of its state assets. Notable results 
were generated within a few months. Last year, the total 
industrial output value and sales income of the corporation 
increased by 6.8 percent and 24.2 percent respectively over the 
previous year, its profits and taxes increased 61.7 percent and 
16.3 percent respectively, and the number of lossmakers and 
losses within the budget fell by 37.5 percent and 52.5 percent 
respectively. Its rate of profit increase was the highest in 
Beijing's industrial sector and among the highest in the light 
industry sector nationwide.

<F P=106> [Report by Zheng Yizheng (6774 5030 2973), chief procurator </F>
of the Fujian Provincial People's Procuratorate, to the Second 
Session of the Eighth Fujian Provincial People's Congress on 14 
April 1994: "Work Report of the Fujian Provincial People's 
Procuratorate" 
  [Text] People's Deputies: 
  I am now going to deliver a report to this congress on the 
main facts about the procuratorial work in 1993 and the main 
tasks for the procuratorate in 1994 for your deliberation. 
  In the past year, the provincial procuratorial organs at all 
levels, under the leadership of the party committees and under 
the supervision of the people's congresses at the same levels, 
conscientiously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; carried out the guideline of "strictly enforcing the 
laws and effectively handling cases" in procuratorial work as a 
whole according to the spirit and the resolution from the First 
Session of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress; intensified 
the legal supervisory function; made new progress in all fields 
of procuratorial work; and made positive contributions to 
maintaining political and social stability and guaranteeing the 
smooth development of reform, opening, and economic construction 
in this province. 
<H5>  I. Concentrate Strength on Handling Major and Serious </H5>
Corruption and Bribery Cases 
  Last year, especially after Comrade Jiang Zemin's important 
speech at the second meeting of the CPC Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission last August, the procuratorial organs at 
all levels resolutely carried out the tasks laid down by the 
party central leadership and by the provincial party committee; 
vigorously carried out an anticorruption struggle; adopted a 
series of measures to crack down on crime more effectively; 
handled a number of major and serious criminal cases, including 
corruption and bribery cases; and achieved new results in their 
work. The procuratorial organs throughout the province placed a 
total of 1,876 corruption, bribery, and other criminal cases on 
file for investigation and prosecution. Of these, 1,119 were 
major cases involving over 10,000 yuan, an increase of 34.5 
percent; cases involving between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan 
numbered 114; cases involving between 500,000 and 1 million yuan 
numbered 22; cases involving over 1 million yuan numbered 13; 
and cases involving lawbreaking by cadres at and above the 
county and bureau level numbered 52, an increase of 370 percent. 
The number of major and serious cases accounted for 62.4 percent 
of the total cases placed on file for investigation and 
prosecution, a recorrd high. By the end of last year, the 
investigation of 1,522 cases had been concluded and involved 
1,786 people to be prosecuted. Apart from those still undergoing 
investigation for prosecution, and those exempt from prosecution 
because of the petty nature of their crimes, prosecutions 
against 770 people were brought to the courts. Through handling 
these cases, 75.31 million yuan's worth of direct economic 
losses caused to the state and the collectives were recovered. 
  Last year's anticorruption struggle and the actions of 
meting 
out punishment to those involved in such crimes as corruption 
and bribery had the following characteristics: 
1. Strength was concentrated on handling major and 
serious cases and a number of economic criminal cases involving 
huge amounts of money were solved. For example, Zhang 
Jianping, head of the first section of the Provincial Foreign 
Trade Center Group Minerals and Chemicals Department, accepted 
bribes [tan wu 6304 3064] of more than $2.74 million and more 
than 640,000 yuan and embezzled [nuo yong 2180 3938] more than 
$170,000 of public money. This was the most serious corruption 
case in this province since the founding of the PRC. After a 
public trial was held, the court sentenced Zhang Jianping to 
death. In another case, Zeng Huiyang, a securities dealer with 
the Trust and Investment Company of the Construction Bank of 
Fujian Province, accepted bribes of 560,000 yuan and embezzled 
4.15 million yuan of public money for illegal stock speculation. 
After a public trial, the court sentenced Zeng Huiyuan to death 
with a reprieve. Cadres at the county and bureau level who were 
involved in the corruption and bribery cases on file for 
investigation and prosecution numbered 47; and cadres at the 
provincial departmental level involved in such cases, numbered 
five. These numbers marked an all-time high. In particular, a 
major bribery case was cracked in the Min Jiang Hydropower 
Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Power Industry. Five 
departmental-level cadres, including bureau chief Zhang Chunbao 
and bureau party committee secretary Qiao Yanling (both with the 
rank of full departmental chief) and 10 bureau-level cadres were 
involved in the case. They demanded and took bribes by taking 
advantage of their official function in issuing work contracts. 
This created strong repercussions inside and outside this 
province. The facts revealed in the course of the investigation 
of such criminal cases show that if the principal leading cadres 
in a department are corrupt and degenerate, crimes there will 
certainly be comparatively serious. Therefore, we always gave 
priority to the thorough handling of some particularly serious 
cases among the major cases. 
  2. Resolute action was taken to handle criminal 
cases which occurred within the party and government leading 
organs, the judicial organs, the law enforcement administrative 
organs, and the economic management organs. Last year, 756 
corruption and bribery cases in these four types of organs were 
investigated and handled. Of these, 126 cases were in party and 
government leading organs, 180 were in judicial and 
law-enforcing administrative organs, and 450 cases were in 
economic management organs. The procuratorate in Nanping 
Prefecture investigated and handled a major cases involving Qu 
Awang and Wei Mingjing, director and deputy director of the 
prefecture's hydropower bureau, who were suspected of abusing 
their official functions and accepting bribes. The 
procuratorate in Quanzhou City investigated and handled the 
major case of Lin Wentao and five other customs officials who 
were suspected of taking bribes amounting to more than 360,000 
yuan and showing favor to smugglers on many occasions by not 
checking the smuggled goods. Chen Ganming, deputy director of 
the Yunxiao County Public Security Bureau, extorted and accepted 
bribes amounting to 34,000 yuan by means of threatening to 
arrest some people. Chen, whose dastardly behavior aroused 
strong public indignation, was sentenced to life imprisonment 
after his trial on the basis of the procuratorial organ's 
investigation. The handling of these cases was of great 
significance in maintaining the incorrupt nature of the party 
and government organs and safeguarding the solemnity of the 
state laws. 
  3. The particularly serious smuggling cases involving 
the law enforcement personnel from some administrative organs 
were directly investigated and handled according to the relevent 
law. Last year, in accordance with Article 13 of the 
"Criminal Procedure Law" and the requirements of the "Circular 
on Sternly Cracking Down on Smuggling Activities" issued jointly 
by the Supreme People's Procuratorate and Supreme People's 
Court, the procuratorial organs directly investigated and 
handled four particularly serious smuggling cases: In the first 
case, Fujian Anhua Development Company participated in smuggling 
600 sets of motorcycle parts with a total value of 8.36 million 
yuan. The department concerned confiscated the smuggled goods 
and imposed a fine on the company but did not transfer the case 
to the judicial organ to bring the criminal offenders in the 
case to justice. The provincial procuratorate placed the case 
on file for investigation and prosecution. The provincial party 
committee, the provincial government, and the provincial 
people's congress attached great importance to the handling of 
this case and strongly supported the procuratorate. After 
efforts over one and a half months, the investigation was 
concluded and a public indictment was filed to the court. In 
the second case, Zhanghai Economic Development Company practiced 
fraud when importing 10,000 tonnes of steel products in the name 
of 17 foreign-funded enterprises for their own use and then 
resold the duty-free goods for 34.7 million yuan, making an 
illegal profit of 1.8 million yuan. The company thus caused 
6.89 million yuan in losses to the state's customs tariff and 
product tax revenue. The Zhangzhou City Procuratorate placed 
the case on file for investigation and prosecution and brought 
those responsible in the case to justice. In the third case, 
Zhanglong Enterprise Co. Ltd. and Zhangan Labor Service Company 
collaborated in smuggling 1,000 Hitachi 63-cm color TV sets. 
The Zhangzhou City Procuratorate has placed the case on file 
for investigation and prosecution. In the fourth case, 12 
people, including the leader and members of an anticontraband 
team headed by Wang Shaomin, director of the Xiapu County 
Industrial and Commercial Administrative Bureau, abused their 
official functions by participating in smuggling 899 cartons of 
cigarettes worth 2.29 million yuan. The Xiapu County 
Procuratorate has concluded investigating the case and has 
conducted a public trial. The procuratorial organs' direct 
investigation and handling of these smuggling cases played a 
positive role in checking the participation by institutions in 
smuggling activities and effectively prompting the law 
enforcement organs concerned to perform their functions 
rigorously. 
  4. Constant efforts were made to rely on the masses in 
performing professional functions. We cannot do without the 
people's support in the course of discovering crimes, collecting 
evidence, and punishing criminal offenders. Last year, the 
procuratorial organs throughout the province received a total of 
15,349 items of information and evidence and 11,921 of these 
items related to cases currently being handled. More people 
provided information using their real names and a larger 
proportion of the information was verifiable. The information 
provided by ordinary people exposed 69.2 percent of the 
corruption, bribery, and other criminal cases on file for 
investigation and prosecution in the procuratorates throughout 
the province. The procuratorates at all levels adhered to the 
principle of "being resolute and prudent and verifying all 
evidence" in the course of investigation and employed all legal 
means with flexibility to unearth major and serious cases. Last 
year, the procuratorial organs in Nanping, Longyan, Fuzhou, and 
Quanzhou successfully collected decisive evidence for 14 
extremely serious corruption cases, involving more than 300 
suspected lawbreakers and over 7 million yuan in ill-gotten 
gains. In the course of handling these major cases, 181 related 
cases were placed on file for investigation and prosecution, of 
which 102 were major cases and 26 were serious cases. The 
procuratorial organs also made more effective efforts to round 
up criminals at large. Last year, 61 economic criminal 
offenders at large were arrested in this province. Ten of these 
people were suspects in serious cases involving over 500,000 
yuan; four were even suspected in cases involving the huge 
amount of over 1 million yuan. In addition, 122 people who had 
committed crimes of corruption surrendered themselves to the 
procuratorial organs because they were frightened by the power 
of the laws. 
  5. Chief procurators took the lead in handling 
cases.We adopted the work system which required that chief 
procurators take the lead in handling cases and defined the 
responsibilities of chief procurators at various levels for 
handling cases of differing seriousness. The chief procurator 
of the provincial procuratorate is responsible for handling 
serious cases involving over 500,000 yuan and major cases 
involving departmental- level cadres; the chief procurators of 
the prefectural and city procuratorates are responsible for 
handling serious cases involving between 100,000 and 500,000 
yuan and major cases involving bureau-level cadres; and the 
chief procurators of the county procuratorates are responsible 
for handling serious cases involving between 50,000 and 100,000 
yuan. Last year, 174 chief procurators and deputy chief 
procurators personally directed and participated in the 
investigation of 674 corruption, bribery, and other criminal 
cases. The chief procurators also personally examined letters 
and complaints from the masses and discovered a number of 
important clues in some major cases. In the practice of taking 
the lead in handling cases, the leaders enhanced their work 
ability to make decisions in a democratic and scientific way and 
to control the overall work situation. 
  Last year, the procuratorial organs investigated and handled 
286 cases of evading taxes and refusing to pay taxes and 87 
cases of counterfeiting trademarks, recovering more than 13 
million yuan in direct economic losses to the state and the 
collectives. 
  The cases being investigated and handled in recent years 
show 
that the seriousness and prominent characteristics of the crimes 
of embezzlement and bribery are reflected in the following 
facts: First, the criminal cases often involve large amounts of 
money and the number of major and serious cases is on the 
increase. Second, an extremely small number of leading cadres 
abuse the power in their hands in pursuit of private gains, 
exchange power for money, and commit serious crimes of 
embezzlement and accepting bribes. Third, a small number of 
functionaries in the judicial and law enforcement administrative 
organs were involved to a serious degree in extorting and 
accepting bribes, bending the law, and other irregularities. 
Fourth, the incidence of economic crimes increased in some 
functional departments which play a key role in regulating the 
market economy and in some active economic sectors. Fifth, 
there were more criminal activities involving legal persons; in 
particular, an extremely small number of law enforcement 
institutions were involved to a serious degree in smuggling 
activities. Sixth, some new forms of criminal activity appeared 
in the stock and securities market and in the real estate 
market. Seventh, economic crimes were committed, in many cases, 
by people holding concrete power in some specific fields; for 
example, those committing crimes of embezzlement were often 
people managing money and those extorting and accepting bribes 
were often people managing personnel, material, and financial 
affairs. Eighth, crimes were committed through collaboration 
between insiders and outsiders and between people from different 
localities and departments. Ninth, in the departments and 
localities where irregularities existed to a serious degree, the 
principal leaders were often corrupt and degenerate and the 
incidence of crimes was higher. Tenth, many criminal offenders 
were motivated by their desire to seek physical pleasures, often 
lavishing their ill-gotten gains on leading a dissipated life, 
gambling, and visiting prostitutes. 
  In general, the vast majority of party and state officials 
are working honestly and diligently for the benefit of the 
general public. However, a small number of seriously corrupt 
people certainly exists and we should be fully aware of the harm 
and danger their existence poses. As Comrade Jiang Zemin 
pointed out, if we take such problems lightly and allow evil to 
spread unchecked, then our party and the people's government 
will eventually be ruined, as will the great cause of socialist 
modernization in our country. 
  At present, the situation in the anticorruption struggle is 
very good and it continues in depth. However, quite a few 
problems still remain. The main problems are: The leaders of 
some departments and localities still do not properly understand 
the necessity to "use both hands to grasp the work and keep both 
hands tough," thus they cannot investigate and handle major and 
serious criminal cases effectively and the anticorruption 
struggle there has not yet achieved good results. In some 
places, the local authorities have replaced the laws with their 
own oral instructions, using their administrative powers to 
interfere in the enforcement of the laws and impeding the 
procuratorial organs in their investigation and handling of 
major and serious cases. Some units do not transfer the 
discovered criminal evidence to the procuratorial organs for 
investigation and prosecution. On the other hand, some chief 
procurators lack the courage to perform their law enforcement 
duties when encountering tough cases; some police officers have 
not adapted their law enforcement methods to the needs of the 
struggle and have yet to enhance their ability to discover and 
verify crimes; some police officers fail to rigorously enforce 
the law, or even bend the law, while performing their duties, 
thus affecting and disrupting the handling of the cases; the 
rate of exemption from prosecution in corruption and bribery 
cases is 33.5 percent, which is still too high though it is a 
bit lower than in the previous year; and the effectiveness of 
the crackdown on crimes has not been markedly improved. In 
addition, the local procuratorates are still short of working 
funds and their technical equipment, transportation, and 
communications remain backward in quality and insufficient in 
quantity. This has also affected the efficiency of 
investigating and handling major and serious cases. All such 
problems and difficulties have to be solved in our future work. 
  II. Maintaining Stability, Sternly Cracking Down on 
Serious Criminal Activities 
  Persistently inflicting stern and quick penalties on serious 
criminal offenders and resolutely cracking down on serious 
criminal activities is an important aspect of our efforts to 
maintain social stability and is also another key point of the 
procuratorial work. Last year, the procuratorates closely 
cooperated with the public security organs, the law courts, and 
the law enforcement administrative departments in taking 
intensive actions to deal with the salient problems in law and 
order and to crack down on various crimes. 
  1. Approving arrest applications and handling cases 
transferred by the public security organs for arrest and 
prosecution in a timely fashion. Last year, the 
procuratorates handled applications submitted by the public 
security organs for the arrest of 16,220 suspects and approved 
14,395 arrests after examination, an increase of 10.9 percent 
over the previous year. The procuratorates handled the cases of 
15,327 suspects for prosecution and for exemption from 
prosecution transferred from the public security organs and 
conducted public trials against 12,062 people, an increase of 
6.4 percent. On the other hand, 1,290 people were exempted from 
prosecution. 
  2. Giving priority to cracking down on such vicious 
and violent crimes as murder, robbery, rape, causing explosions, 
and the illegal use of firearms and cracking down on criminal 
gangs with the nature of triads. Last year, the 
procuratorates approved the arrest of 5,150 suspects involved in 
serious violent crimes and brought 4,137 of them to public 
trial, increases of 29.8 and 27.1 percent respectively. The 
procuratorates also approved the arrest of 549 members of crime 
syndicates and prosecuted 322 of them, increases of 9.8 and 14.6 
percent respectively. 
  3. Taking an active part in the struggle against 
highway and railroad robbery, theft, smuggling, illegal 
emigration, and prostitution. The procuratorates at all 
levels conscientiously carried out the instructions of the 
central authorities and the provincial party committee on 
suppressing highwaymen and railroad robbers. They dispatched 
investigation teams led by chief procurators to key areas and 
sections of highways and railroads, cooperating with the 
departments concerned in rounding up and suppressing highwaymen 
and railroad robbers. Last year, the procuratorates approved 
the arrest and pursuit of 1,516 highwaymen and railroad robbers, 
increases of 15.6 and 17.6 percent respectively. The 
procuratorates in coastal areas intensified the crackdown on 
smuggling and illegal emigration and approved the arrest of 101 
people suspected of illegal emigration and prosecuted 161 such 
criminals (including those arrested during the previous year). 
This included the approved arrest of 91 organizers of illegal 
emigration (also called "snake heads") and the prosecution 101 
such criminals (including those arrested in the previous year). 
Action was also taken to punish lawbreakers who committed such 
crimes as trafficking in drugs, selling pornographic items, 
abducting and kidnapping women and children, and enticing and 
forcing women to practice prostitution. The procuratorates 
approved the arrest of 391 suspects in such crimes, prosecuting 
439 criminals (including those arrested in the previous year). 
  4. Increasing the advance participation in the 
handling of serious criminal cases. The procuratorates 
made advance participation in the handling of 2,733 serious 
criminal cases from the stage of approving arrests and made 
advance participation in the handling of 1,808 serious criminal 
cases from the investigation and prosecution stage, increases of 
225 and 250 percent respectively. The advance participation in 
the investigations and preliminary hearings not only enhanced 
the efficiency and quality of the work of approving arrests and 
conducting prosecutions but also enabled the procuratorial 
personnel to discover facts relating to the cases in good time, 
collect sufficient evidence, cooperate with the public security 
organs more closely, and supervise the investigation activities 
more effectively. 
  5. Improving the effectiveness of the procuratorial 
link in the comprehensive measures for maintaining public 
security and public order. Through the public prosecutions 
in the courts, the procuratorates played a positive role in 
giving publicity to the laws and regulations, helping cadres and 
ordinary people increase their understanding of the laws and 
regulations and prompting them into abiding by the laws and 
regulations. Through handling criminal cases, the 
procuratorates also made suggestions to the units where crimes 
occurred about removing the hidden perils. The procuratorates 
gave more effective reeducation to convicts undergoing reform 
through labor and to offenders who were exempted from 
prosecution. They also carried out the established measures for 
helping and educating offenders exempted from prosecution and 
convicts being released after completing their prison terms and 
reeducation-through-labor terms by calling on these people and 
monitoring their behavior regularly. The procuratorates set up 
fixed ties for maintaining law and order with certain factories, 
mines, schools, and villages; paid close attention to trends in 
society; and organized mass activities of preventing and 
cracking down on crimes. The procuratorates conscientiously 
carried out the "Law on Protecting Minors" adopted by the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee, improved the work 
of arrest approval and prosecution involving cases of juvenile 
delinquency, and strengthened measures for preventing juvenile 
delinquency and for educating and rescuing juvenile delinquents. 
The procuratorates conscientiously handled letters and 
complaints from the masses and took the initiative in helping 
the departments concerned to promptly and properly handle 
collective complaints and civil disputes, thus removing various 
factors which could affect social stability. 
  At present, public order in the province is stable on the 
whole but the law and order situation remains rather stern. The 
hostile forces and individuals within and without the mainland 
of China have never stopped their sabotage and secret-stealing 
activities; serious criminal cases are still on the increase and 
violent criminal cases have been increasing by a big margin; the 
activities of crime syndicates in some places remain rampant and 
some of these crime syndicates are triads; and factors which can 
affect political stability and public order continue to 
increase. In law enforcement work, some localities are still 
failing to crack down on criminal activities effectively. We 
should closely cooperate with the public security and state 
security organs, and with the people's courts, in taking 
resolute action against counterrevolutionary criminals who 
endanger state security in various forms and against serious 
criminal offenders, making efforts to safeguard political 
stability and public order. 
<H5>  III. Performing the Functions in Rigorous Law Enforcement </H5>
  Last year, we particularly emphasized rigorous law 
enforcement. The procuratorates themselves were required to 
rigorously enforce the law and to intensify internal control 
over the handling of cases which they directly investigated; on 
the other hand, they conscientiously performed the duties of 
exercising legal supervision as stipulated by the Constitution 
and other laws and intensified the supervision over the law 
enforcement work of the other institutions concerned. 
1. Intensifying supervision over 
investigation.Attention was paid mainly to the phenomena of 
not bringing lawbreakers to justice and replacing terms of 
imprisonment with fines. The procuratorates rigorously 
performed their duty of exercising legal supervision over the 
investigation activities of the public security organs. They 
also took legal measures to correct the practice of not bringing 
lawbreakers to justice or treating innocent people as criminal 
offenders, as soon as such problems were discovered. Last year, 
in the course of examining the arrest applications and the 
prosecution preparations, the procuratorates issued warrants for 
the arrest of 223 lawbreakers at large and instituted 
prosecutions against 29 criminal suspects who had not been 
prosecuted initially; on the other hand, the procuratorates 
overruled the arrest of 792 people who had not committed any 
crime and whose arrest was unnecessary, decided not to prosecute 
66 people who should not have been suspected of having committed 
a crime, and returned the cases of 4,359 suspects to the public 
security organs for further investigation. The procuratorates 
submitted 314 proposals for correcting illegal practices in the 
investigation process. Some local procuratorates also 
supervised the handling of major criminal cases and took action 
according to the laws and regulations to correct the practice of 
failing to charge and arrest lawbreakers or replacing necessary 
prison sentences with fines. For example, Wang Teh-chin, a 
lawbreaker from Taiwan, colluded with six other lawbreakers in 
Aoqian Town, Pingtan County, in organizing the illegal 
emigration of 112 people and gaining an illegal profit of 1.7 
million yuan. Under the legal supervision of the local 
procuratorate concerned, the case was properly handled and the 
criminals in the case were punished according to law. 
  2. Intensifying supervision over the trials of 
criminal cases and sentencing. Attention was paid mainly to 
incorrect court judgments which treated serious crimes as petty 
crimes or treated the guilty as innocent, protests being filed 
against such judgments. The provincial procuratorate dispatched 
special officials to investigate a number of cases in which the 
courts announced the innocence of the accused in some 
localities. Protests were filed if the court judgments were 
found to be incorrect. Last year, the procuratorates filed 50 
protests against incorrect court decisions on criminal cases and 
put forward 46 proposals to correct the lawbreaking practices in 
court hearings. 
  3. Intensifying discipline supervision over legal 
proceedings. Attention was mainly paid to malpractices by 
some government functionaries in abusing their powers, 
infringing upon people's civil rights, and cases of malfeasance. 
Last year, the procuratorates investigated and handled 352 
cases of such malpractices as bending the law for private gain, 
extorting confessions by torture, effecting illegal detention, 
neglecting public duties, and causing serious accidents through 
dereliction of duty. Such cases accounted for 81.3 percent of 
the lawbreaking cases in the law enforcement field. The 
Quanzhou City Procuratorate investigated, in accordance with the 
law, the case of Lin Zhaoze and others in the Nanan City Public 
Security Bureau, who tortured people under interrogation to 
death; the investigation has been concluded and a public trial 
held. The Hanjiang District Procuratorate in Putian City 
investigated, in accordance with the law, the case of Yao 
Yinghuang, a policeman from the Suburban Police Station of the 
District Public Security Sub-bureau, who illegally detained and 
beat up Chen Guozhang, a people's deputy in Putian County. A 
public trail was held and the court sentenced Yao ot one year's 
imprisonment, suspended for 18 months. 
  4. Intensifying supervision over prisons and places 
for reeducating convicts. Attention was paid mainly to 
such lawbreaking cases as prison management personnel who 
practiced corruption, took bribes, performed corporal punishment 
and mistreatment prisoners, releasing prisoners illegally, and 
neglecting official duties. Supervision over court decisions in 
criminal cases and the implementation of such decisions was also 
strengthened. The procuratorates corrected the illegal and 
unwarranted detention of 70 people, the illegal release of 61 
people, and the continuing imprisonment of 18 people who should 
have been released. They also corrected the handling of 23 
convicts who were improperly released on parole, whose prison 
terms were improperly decreased or increased, and who were 
released on bail for medical treatment. The procuratorates gave 
advice on correcting the illegal practices in prison management, 
including illegally prolonging the prison terms of some 
convicts. As some prisons and places of correction ordered 
convicts or their families to pay unfair and irregular charges 
and fees, the procuratorates investigated such problems and 
promptly checked such practices. At the same time, the 
procuratorates cooperated with the correction institutions in 
resolutely suppressing convicts who took the lead in resisting 
prison management and acting as overlords among their fellow 
prisoners. Prosecutions were brought against 178 convicts who 
were undergoing reform through labor or receiving reeducation 
through labor when they committed new crimes while serving their 
sentences. 
5. Intensifying procuratorial supervision over the 
handling of civil and administrative cases. Attention was 
paid mainly to lodging protests against incorrect court 
judgments in civil, economic, and administrative disputes. Last 
year, the procuratorates handled 541 such appeals, placed 121 
cases on file for investigation, and finished the investigation 
of 115 cases. They lodged protests against the court decisions 
on 33 of these cases to the procuratorates at the higher levels 
and lodged protests on 24 cases to courts, with different 
decisions being made by the courts. At the same time, serious 
action was taken against the court personnel who made incorrect 
judgments in civil cases by perverting justice after accepting 
bribes and private gains. Xue Lizhi, deputy chief judge of the 
Pingtan County Court, and Lin Maohao, an assistant judge of the 
court, accepting 20,000 yuan in bribes when handling a debt 
dispute case. They thus practiced fraud and bent the law when 
making the judgment. The procuratorate concerned investigated 
the case and brought a prosecution against the court officials. 
They were sentenced to imprisonment for five and six years 
respectively. The procuratorate also lodged a protest against 
the first court judgment on the civil case. 
  6. Intensifying procuratorial supervision over the 
handling of appeals. Attention was paid mainly to 
reexamining the handling of appeals against decisions on 
exemptions from prosecution and against court decisions in 
criminal cases. Last year, the procuratorial organs handled 552 
initial appeals within their jurisdiction, gave replies to 276 
appeals, placed 182 criminal appeals on file for reexamination, 
and corrected the decisions on 38 cases. Of the appeals, 151 
were against the decision on exemption from prosecution and the 
original decision on 32 cases was changed; three were criminal 
appeals against the sentences made by the courts and one case 
was retried by the court and the original sentence was changed. 
  Through intensifying supervision over law enforcement the 
procuratorates played a positive role in prompting the 
departments concerned to rigorously enforce the law, 
guaranteeing the unified and correct enforcement of the state 
law, and protecting the democratic and personal rights of the 
citizens. However, they still could not fully perform the 
function of exercising legal supervision and their supervision 
was still not effective enough. The environment and conditions 
for rigorous law enforcement have yet to be improved. The new 
situation of establishing the socialist market economy urgently 
requires rigorous law enforcement. The established laws must be 
followed and rigorously enforced and those who violate the law 
must be brought to justice. Therefore, it is necessary to carry 
out legal supervision more effectively. 
<H5>  IV. Setting Strict Demands on the Procuratorial Personnel </H5>
and Guaranteeing Their Integrity and Ability 
  Over the past year, the procuratorates at all levels 
persistently carried out the principle of strictly performing 
procuratorial functions according to law and made great effort 
to improve their work and enhance the political and professional 
quality of the procuratorial personnel. 
  In order to guarantee the integrity of the procuratorial 
personnel, we adopted five main measures: First, we required 
leading cadres to carry out serious self-examination and 
self-correction, strictly in accordance with the five-point 
anticorruption self-discipline requirements laid down by the 
central authorities. Second, we resolutely investigated and 
handled lawbreaking and violation of discipline cases occurring 
among procuratorial personnel, never shielding the evildoers or 
concealing the problems. Last year, we handled 32 such cases, 
three of which were criminal cases. Zheng Lilin, an assistant 
procurator of the Gulou District Procuratorate in Fuzhou City, 
accepted bribes and then absconded to avoid punishment. He is 
still on the wanted list. Liu Tong, an assistant procurator from 
the Longyan City Procuratorate, joined others engaging in 
illicit coal trading and evading taxes. He was sentenced to six 
months' detention. Third, we resolutely checked and corrected 
the illegal practice of abusing the procuratorial functions by 
levying irregular charges. Some grass-roots procuratorates 
charged fees for exempting from prosecution, fees for criminal 
investigations, guarantee money for repentance and bail, 
amounting to a total of 154,600 yuan. All the money has been 
returned to those who paid it. Fourth, we seriously screened 
and reorganized the business companies run by procuratorates. 
The procuratorates throughout the province once ran 36 business 
companies; 23 have been closed down, 11 were transferred to 
other institutions, and two are still being handled. Fifth, we 
conscientiously implemented the "Circular on Strictly Enforcing 
Discipline and Rigorously Enforcing the Laws in Law Enforcement 
Departments" issued by the Central Commission on Politics and 
Law, further establishing and perfecting anticorruption rules 
and regulations, strengthening the work of discipline inspection 
and supervision, and improving the internal supervisory 
mechanisms. 
  Strengthening ideological and political work. Cadres and 
policemen were organized to study the third volume of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" so that they could arm their 
minds with the theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. They were also organized in studying the 
theoretical knowledge about the socialist market economic 
structure in order to enhance their firmness and consciousness 
in carrying out the party's basic line. Education was given to 
all procuratorial personnel on the issues of rigorous law 
enforcement, procuratorial discipline, the principle of serving 
the people wholeheartedly, and honestly performing official 
duties. Publicity was given to the progressive and exemplary 
deeds of the procuratorial personnel who performed official 
duties honestly, faithfully, and with selfless dedication and 
advanced collectives and individuals in various aspects of the 
procuratorial work, especially in the forefront of case 
handling, were commended. Through the establishment of the chief 
procurator training system, procuratorial diploma courses were 
given to procuratorial personnel and professional training was 
organized in various forms and through various channels. 
Education and training for cadres were strengthened. 
  Last year, the election of new leading bodies in grass-roots 
procuratorates throughout the province was completed. A number 
of outstanding young and middle-aged cadres, with integrity and 
ability and with professional knowledge and practical 
experience, were elected as chief procurators. The leading 
bodies in the grass-roots procuratorates were consolidated and 
strengthened. 
  Last year, according to the Supreme People's Procuratorate 
instructions, tax affairs procuratorial offices, mainly at the 
township level, were consolidated and improved. The management 
systems and the organizational structure were improved so that 
they functioned more effectively. 
  Over the past year, the vast number of procuratorial cadres 
and police officers in this province demonstrated a high morale 
and good working style while facing arduous tasks and difficult 
conditions. They were tempered in the anticorruption struggle 
and stood tests in that struggle. A number of advanced 
collectives and individuals emerged in the work and they made 
outstanding contributions to the improvement of the 
procuratorial work in all aspects. 
<H5>  V. Implementing the "Regulations" and Conscientiously </H5>
Accepting the Supervision By the People's Congress 
  Last year, the procuratorial organs at all levels 
conscientiously implemented the "Regulations on Subjecting the 
Procuratorial Organs to Supervision by the People's Congresses 
and Their Standing Committees" laid down by the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate and subjected their work to supervision by the 
state power organs. First, continuing to pursue the effective 
systems of giving regular work reports, special reports on 
important issues, immediate reports on major cases, and advance 
reports on personnel changes. Last year, the provincial 
people's congress standing committee held the chairman's meeting 
and the fourth plenary meeting to listen to the provincial 
procuratorate reports on cracking down on the crime's of 
corruption and bribery. The meetings also emphasized the need 
to bring the functions of the procuratorial organs into better 
play. This played an important role in guiding and promoting the 
work of the procuratorates in the process of rigorous law 
enforcement and effective case handling. 
  Some local 
procuratorates set up the system of keeping a namelist of local 
people's deputies and keeping regular contacts with them. They 
included the activities of contacting people's deputies in their 
routine work plans and made concrete arrangements for this. 
Second, chief procurators attended the meetings of the people's 
congress standing committees as observers, resolutely carried 
out the resolutions and decisions adopted by the people's 
congress standing committees, and conscientiously accepted the 
law enforcement inspections by the people's congress standing 
committees. They also seriously considered the opinions of the 
people's congress standing committees and promptly adopted 
measures for solving the problems discovered during the 
inspections. Third, the procuratorates conscientiously 
considered the opinions expressed by people's deputies and the 
measures passed by the people's congresses. They assigned 
special cadres to take charge of cases and other affairs, 
including the motions, proposals, criticisms, and opinions 
transferred from the people's congresses. They also gave quick 
feedback to the people's congresses. Through accepting 
supervision by the people's congresses and their standing 
committees, we deeply felt that such supervision was supportive 
of our work and, only under the supervision of the state's power 
organs, could the procuratorial organs correctly and effectively 
perform their functions and fully play a role in exercising 
legal supervision. 
  People's deputies: 
  In 1994, the general tasks for the whole party and the whole 
nation is to grasp the opportunity, deepen the reform, expand 
opening, promote development, and maintain stability. The 
procuratorial work must be properly oriented to the needs of 
these general tasks and must serve their general fulfillment. 
At the provincial chief procurators meeting earlier this year, 
we fixed our main tasks for the year: Under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, we must: Conscientiously carry out the 
spirit of the 3d Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and the instructions by the central leadership on 
struggling against corruption; persistently carry out the 
principle of "using both hands to grasp the work and keeping 
both hands tough"; strengthen the legal supervision function; 
rigorously enforce the laws and regulations; effectively handle 
cases; concentrate strength on investigating and handling major 
criminal cases of corruption and bribery, criminal cases 
involving legal persons, and cases of not rigorously enforcing 
laws; sternly crack down on serious criminal activities; take an 
active part in the comprehensive activities of maintaining law 
and order in society; safeguard political stability and public 
order; create a benign law environment for reform, opening, and 
modernization in this province; and promote the establishment 
and development of the socialist market economic structure. 
  1. In the anticorruption struggle, continue to 
concentrate strength on investigating and handling major and 
serious cases. Priority is to be given to investigating and 
handling criminal cases involving party and government leading 
organs, leading cadres, the judicial institutions, the law 
enforcement administrative institutions, the economic management 
institutions, and their personnel; especially the criminal cases 
of corruption and bribery among leading cadres, cases of bending 
the law by judicial and law enforcement administrative personnel 
in the course of law enforcement, and the criminal cases 
involving legal persons. Top priority is to be given to 
handling the most important serious cases and the most important 
major cases and such cases must be handled conscientiously. No 
matter who is involved in such cases, the investigations must be 
thoroughly carried out without leniency. It is necessary to 
sort out the available evidence and information promptly, 
especially that related to major and serious cases. Attention 
should be paid to the comprehensive and flexible employment of 
various legal investigation means and efforts should be made to 
collect decisive evidence. The provincial procuratorate and the 
prefectural and city procuratorates should organize, direct, and 
inspect the investigation and handling of major and serious 
cases more effectively. They should supervise and guide the 
work of their immediate subordinates, thus advancing the 
struggle in depth, step by step, by removing obstacles and 
resistance. 
  2. Persistently carry out the principle of inflicting 
severe and quick punishments on serious criminal offenders 
according to law and sternly cracking down on serious criminal 
activities. Priority is to be given to cracking down on 
such crimes of violence as murder, robbery, rape, causing 
explosions, and stealing firearms and cracking down on crime 
syndicates, especially triads. Arrests and prosecutions should 
be carried out as quickly as possible according to law so that 
severe punishments can be inflicted on the criminals through 
cooperation with the departments concerned. We must take an 
active part in the struggle to crack down on crime syndicates, 
solve major cases, and round up criminals at large. We must 
also participate in cracking down on highway and railroad 
robbery, thefts, abduction, prostitution, smuggling, and illegal 
emigration. The procuratorial work related to state security 
will be strengthened and severe action will be taken against 
criminals who endanger our social and political stability in 
various ways. At the same time, the procuratorial link in the 
comprehensive management of public security will also be 
strengthened. 
  3. Intensify law enforcement supervision and correct 
the problems of not strictly enforcing the law. Attention 
will be paid to uncovering various phenomena of not following 
the legal procedures in handling cases and not strictly 
enforcing the law. We will shortly advance proposals on 
correcting such practices. In particular, we shall investigate 
and handle such criminal cases among the judicial and 
administrative law enforcing personnel as abusing power, bending 
the law to seek private gain, shielding evildoers, extorting 
confessions by means of torture, effecting illegal detention, 
mistreating or employing corporal punishment on people in jail 
or under detention, covering up criminal facts, providing false 
evidence, and harboring criminals, resolutely bringing such 
lawbreakers to justice. 
  4. Consolidate the contingent of the procuratorial 
personnel and enhance their integrity and law enforcement 
ability. We will earnestly study the third volume of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," arm our minds with the theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and 
continuously enhance the integrity and ability of the 
procuratorial cadres and police officers. We must seriously 
deal with the corrupt phenomena existing among the procuratorial 
personnel and resolutely investigate and handle the lawbreaking 
and violation of discipline cases among them. At the same time, 
we will persistently carry out the principle of "running the 
procuratorates and performing the procuratorial functions 
strictly according to law." We will conduct reeducation on 
ideals, beliefs, and principles fo all procuratorial personnel 
and will require them to strictly abide by laws and discipline, 
rigorously enforce the laws and regulations, and handle cases in 
a correct manner. We will also conduct discipline and 
professional ethical education for them and establish and 
perfect the concrete anticorruption rules for the procuratorial 
personnel, the responsibility system for case handling, and 
various rules and regulations for internal supervision and 
self-discipline. 
  People's deputies: The people's procuratorates at all levels 
in this province and all procuratorial cadres and police 
officers will, under the effective leadership of the party 
committees and under the supervision of the people's congresses 
and their standing committees, will continue to make greater 
achievements in their work, overcome difficulties, and make new 
and solid progress in the effective and efficient handling of 
cases, the rigorous enforcement of the laws and regulations, and 
in doing down-to-earth work to perform the procuratorial 
function in all aspects.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yuan Yang (6678 3152): "Where Does the </F>
`Southbound' Road Lead? -- Commenting on Taiwan's `Southbound 
Policy'"] 
  [Text] On the 10th of the first lunar month of 1994, Subic 
Bay, 80 km northwest of the Philippine capital of Manila, 
received an industrial and commercial investigation delegation 
from Taiwan. This large delegation of nearly 100 people included 
Taiwan officials and entrepreneurs. Having heard the hosts' 
introduction to the investment situation there, a Taiwan 
entrepreneur of the delegation thought that the preferential 
treatment offered was poor, and indicated that he "would not 
invest in a factory in Subic Bay." 
  Subic Bay is an excellent natural port of the Philippines. 
It is surrounded on three sides by mountains, the water is 
deep, and the port is spacious. In 1941 the United States and 
the Philippines signed an agreement to lease Subic Bay, which 
the United States turned into its largest naval base in Asia. 
At the end of November 1992 the lease ran out, and American 
troops withdrew from Subic Bay. 
  For the Taiwan authorities to invest in Subic Bay and 
develop 
an industrial zone in cooperation with the local people is an 
important component of Taiwan's implementation of its southbound 
economic and trade policies. 
<H5>  The Major Contents of the "Southbound Policy" </H5>
  The southbound economic and trade investment and cooperation 
plan drawn up by the Taiwan "Ministry of Economy" requires that 
"state- operated" enterprises belonging to the "Ministry of 
Economy" and the Kuomintang party-run enterprises take the lead 
and, at the same time, bring along nongovernmental enterprises 
to participate in the southbound investment plan. 
  The region covered by this investment plan is Southeast 
Asia. 
The plan includes four aspects: Investigate and study the 
economic and trade movements of Southeast Asia and come up with 
corresponding measures, expand bilateral trade between Taiwan 
and Southeast Asia, strengthen bilateral investment and 
technical cooperation, and effectively promote substantive 
bilateral economic and trade relationships. 
  This so-called economic and trade plan actually contains 
political motives. An official of the Taiwan "Ministry of 
Economy" pointed out frankly: "Choosing Southeast Asia as an 
economic and trade emphasis of our southbound policy is because 
we want to use economic and trade exchange to expand room for 
diplomacy." 
<H5>  The Background and Reasons Behind the "Southbound Policy" </H5>
  Beginning in the early seventies, Taiwan developed economic 
and trade relations with Southeast Asian countries, and by the 
mid- eighties bilateral economic and trade relations had become 
heated, reaching a peak at the end of the eighties. In the 
nineties, these relations began to decline. Statistical data 
indicates that by 1993, Taiwan's investment volume in Southeast 
Asia had already exceeded $16 billion. 
  During the late eighties, when Taiwan capital flowed into 
Southeast Asia the most, the Taiwan authorities had not raised a 
"Southbound policy", they were, on the contrary, worried about 
the "gutting of Taiwan industry." In that case, why do they 
push hard for a "Southbound policy" today? This is closely 
related to the problems faced by Taiwan economic development, 
the rapid economic development trend of the Asia-Pacific region, 
including Southeast Asia, and the economic trade development 
trends between both sides of the Taiwan Straits. 
  Since the eighties, the economy of the Asia-Pacific region 
has developed rapidly, leading the regional economic development 
of the world. Taiwan, belonging to the Asia-Pacific region, 
beginning in the mid-eighties has suffered from a drastic 
deterioration in its internal investment environment, rising 
labor costs, land price-hikes, a rise in the environmental 
protection movement -- facing medium and small enterprises with 
huge pressures for survival. It is from such a background that 
a large batch of medium and small enterprises have moved to 
regions where land and labor are relatively cheap. 
  The Taiwan authorities have thought that, with its economic 
power and geographical factor, Taiwan can play an important role 
in the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region, becoming 
an operating center in the Asia-Pacific region. According to 
this concept, the Taiwan of the future not only wants to become 
the transportation center of the Asia-Pacific region, but also 
wants to become the center of information, business, and 
personnel training. Large corporate groups and multinational 
corporations would all set up their headquarters in Taiwan, 
while other Asia-Pacific countries would only have their branch 
and representative offices. The manufacturing center of various 
high-tech products would be in Taiwan, with product assembling 
distributed in the Asia-Pacific region, forming an industrial 
structure with a vertical division of labor. 
  In this ambitious grand plan, the southbound economic and 
trade policy has been a component, and the promotion of a 
southbound policy has been to create the conditions for the 
realization of Taiwan becoming the operating center of the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  Early in the 1990's, with the gradual reduction of tensions 
in the relationship between both sides of the Taiwan Straits, 
economic and trade relations have developed rapidly. In 1993, 
indirect trade volume between both sides exceeded $10 billion, 
and the negotiated capital of Taiwan investment in the mainland 
during recent years has exceeded $10 billion. This 
complementary and mutually beneficial economic and trade 
cooperation between the two sides has promoted economic 
prosperity for both parties. However, out of political 
considerations, and not from the economic interests of both 
sides, the Taiwan authorities think of all kinds of ways to 
continuously lower the temperature of the island's "mainland 
investment fever" and advocate the "scattering of Taiwan 
businessmen's investment in the mainland" and the "weaning of 
ourselves from dependence on the mainland market." The other 
purpose of its "southbound policy" has been to persuade Taiwan 
businesses into increasing their investment in Southeast Asia, 
hence "counterbalancing" their investment in the mainland. 
<H5>  The Political Motivation of the "Southbound Policy" </H5>
  In order to promote the "southbound policy," some 
decisionmakers of the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort 
to visit countries in Southeast Asia to conduct so-called 
"vacation diplomacy." Various signs indicate that the 
"southbound policy" is an important measure in the Taiwan 
authorities' promotion of "pragmatic diplomacy"; it is an 
attempt to obtain the status of a political entity in Southeast 
Asia. 
  In order to "expand room for survival in the world," as it 
is 
called, the Taiwan authorities again and again have disregarded 
the principle of "one China," and have used all kinds of means 
-- from the "silver-bullet diplomacy" and "money diplomacy" of 
the early eighties, to the "dual recognition" of the early 
nineties, to the promotion of "substantive relationships" with 
certain "influential countries," all the way to the unbridled 
activities last year of trying to "return to the United 
Nations." However, the "result" they have obtained has not been 
ideal. The Taiwan authorities, especially after encountering 
defeat in last year's attempt to "return to the United Nations," 
have decided to make 1994 "the year of seeking a new orientation 
in diplomacy." As such, the Taiwan authorities have turned their 
foreign relations emphasis to the neighboring areas of Southeast 
Asia, attempting to become a dialogue partner of ASEAN, and to 
obtain the status of a political entity, and then to further 
squeeze into regional international organizations. At the same 
time, they have also modified their methods and come up with 
disguises such as "vacation diplomacy" and "informal visits" in 
order to cover up the substance of striving for "two Chinas," or 
"one China, one Taiwan." 
  Taiwan has no "diplomatically related country" in Asia, and 
all countries only recognize the government of the People's 
Republic of China as the only legitimate government representing 
China, with Taiwan as a part of China. This situation is not 
something that the Taiwan authorities can change with its 
"economic and trade advantages" or by using "vacation diplomacy." 
<H5>  The "Southbound Policy" Arouses Wide Discussion </H5>
  After the "southbound policy" was raised, it attracted 
discussion from the political circles, media, academia, and 
business circles of the mainland. They expressed opinions on 
the economic significance and political intention of the policy, 
the practicality of its implementation, the relationship of the 
"southbound policy" with mainland policies, and various other 
aspects. 
  A Taiwan economist has analyzed the important significance 
of 
the "southbound policy" for Taiwan's economic development. He 
believes three major economic forces may appear in the 
Asia-Pacific region in the future: Japan, mainland China, and 
ASEAN. Being sandwiched between the three powers, Taiwan must 
maneuver among these economic forces to maintain its economic 
development. Establishing an industrial division of labor with 
Southeast Asia countries is the most advantageous to Taiwan. 
  An influential Taiwan newspaper expressed, in an editorial, 
doubts that the "southbound policy" would realize a "diplomatic 
opening up." That editorial stated that if the basic diplomatic 
policies of the Southeast Asian countries did not change, then 
no matter how hard Taiwan pushed its "southbound" policy, it 
would be difficult to turn economic and trade forces into 
diplomatic forces. The editorial said that "it will be 
difficult" for Taiwan "to turn its economic and trade relations 
with ASEAN countries into diplomatic pressure against Communist 
China." 
  A Taiwan newspaper reporter expressed the following thoughts 
after visiting Subic Bay in the Philippines: The "southbound 
policy" is an up-current movement in the general movement of the 
Asian market. That reporter likened the mainland to a "super 
magnetic field," while Southeast Asia was a "small magnetic 
field." He believed that the Taiwan authorities were now "using 
the state- operated and party-operated businesses as a main 
electric current to divert Taiwan businessmen from the large 
magnetic field to the small magnetic field." He wondered: "Is 
the power of this electric current really that strong?" 
  A Taiwan businessman who has invested in both the mainland 
and the Philippines said that, within a short period of time, it 
will not be easy to see the investment results of Taiwan 
businessmen answering the "southbound" call because the cost of 
investment opportunities is still the most important 
consideration of Taiwan businessmen. In addition, language 
problems are also an obstacle to Taiwan businessmen investing in 
the south. 
  Another large Taiwan newspaper expressed doubts that the 
"southbound policy" could turn Taiwan into the operating center 
of the Asia-Pacific. This newspaper said in an editorial that 
if enterprises took Southeast Asian countries as their targets 
for market development, then from the perspectives of 
geographical location, humanities, and social conditions, the 
best central depots were Singapore and Hong Kong, not Taiwan. 
  In discussing the relationship between the "southbound 
policy" and the mainland policies, this editorial made this 
analysis: The key to implementing the "southbound policy" is a 
more open mainland policy. If the transport and business 
channels between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits can be 
opened up, then the key position and central depot function of 
Taiwan in Southeast Asia region will have a better chance of 
showing itself. 
  In sum, the Taiwan authorities' promotion of the "southbound 
policy" is, on the one hand, to seek a road for the island's 
economic development in an attempt to use Taiwan's economic 
power to obtain the crucial position of being a business center 
in the flourishing economic development of the Asia-Pacific 
region and, on the other hand, to divert Taiwan businessmen's 
investment from the mainland towards the Southeast Asia region 
in order to be rid of a "dependency on the mainland market." 
The political intention of this policy is to open up and build 
up "substantive relations" with the so-called "economic and 
trade advantages" -- first to obtain the status of a political 
entity in the Southeast Asia region, and then gradually to 
squeeze into regional international organizations in order to 
realize the goal of "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas." 
  As some foreign media have pointed out, some important 
policy 
measures of the Taiwan authorities have been far from the 
objective reality. These are often "self-inflated propaganda or 
wishful suggestions." It seems that the "southbound policy" is 
no exception.

<F P=106> [By Chip Tsao, political editor] </F>
  [Text] Millions of potential holders of British National 
(Overseas) (BNO) passports face having to apply for travel visas 
for almost all countries except Britain after 1997. China's 
refusal to cooperate with Britain in lobbying for recognition of 
the validity of BNO passports threatens to cause serious 
problems, a senior Hong Kong government official warned 
yesterday. 
  Seventy-one countries grant visa-free status to the BNO 
passport but such arrangements could be scrapped by all except 
Britain after 1997. 
  An absence of clear recognition of the BNO by China would 
leave countries with the fear that if a BNO passport holder was 
declared an undesirable person, Britain would not take 
responsibility for repatriation nor would there be any guarantee 
that person could be returned to the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (SAR). "The situation is really worse than 
most people seem to realise," the official said. "The main 
practical consideration of the third country is will Britain 
take these people back when they have problems?" 
  Britain wants an understanding with China that the British 
will lobby for the visa-free arrangements to continue for the 
BNO after 1997 as well as the Hong Kong SAR passports issued by 
China after 1997. SAR passports will be issued to Hong Kong 
residents who were formerly CI (Certificate of Identity) holders 
and the Hong Kong born who do not wish to carry BNO passports. 
  "What Britain will need is a letter from China to say that 
is 
no problem and BNO will continue," the official said. 
"Likewise, for China, they need the Hong Kong Government to 
tell the third countries that SAR passports are just as reliable 
as BNO. Otherwise they are going to get nowhere with SAR 
passports and the BNO is not going to be what they gave everyone 
the impression that it would be, which is a travel document 
which can be used after 1997." 
  He said there was no sign at present that Beijing saw the 
practical need to work together with Hong Kong. "What we are 
trying to do is to try to make a practical arrangement in 
advance of 1997. We are not fighting for BNO against SAR 
passports," he said. 
  The Hong Kong government has expressed a willingness to 
cooperate with China in issuing SAR passports before 1997 
because it would take two to three years for the new passport to 
be recognised by foreign countries. 
  The government official warned that Hong Kong's economic 
prosperity could be undermined if people's freedom of travel was 
affected. 
  Some 3.3 million people in Hong Hong are eligible for the 
BNO 
passport, the travel document that will replace the British 
Dependent Territory Citizen (BDTC) passport after 1997. More 
than 500,000 people already possess BNO passports, which give 
people right of entry but not right of abode, in Britain. 
  Countries offering visa-free treatment to BNO passports 
include Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Malaysia, the 
Netherlands, Switzerland, South Africa, and Thailand. Only 
Switzerland has said current arrangements will not change after 
1997. 
  A Thai consulate-general spokesman said the future situation 
"depends on the status of this passport (BNO) in the British 
system and how it will be treated by the UK Government itself".

  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin stressed again this afternoon that 
China has indisputable sovereign rights over the Nansha 
[Spratly] Islands and their waters. Vietnam will be infringing 
on China's rights and interests in entering into contracts with 
any oil company on prospecting and exploiting oil deposits in 
waters around the Nansha Islands, and such contracts are illegal. 
  Wu Jianmin made this statement at a routine Foreign Ministry 
press conference in Beijing in reply to a reporter's question 
about Vietnam's cooperation with the U.S. Mobil Corporation in 
recovering oil deposits in the Lanlong Sea. 
  Wu said: The Lanlong Sea lies within the waters of the 
Nansha Islands. China has always favored solving international 
disputes in a peaceful manner, and likewise, holds that the 
Nansha issue can be solved through peaceful consultations. 
  On Prince Sihanouk's planning to invite Khmer Rouge leaders 
to participate in new national elections, Wu Jianmin said: This 
is an internal affair for Cambodia. China hopes that all 
Cambodian factions will solve their internal problems properly 
and will achieve national reconciliation under the leadership of 
Prince Sihanouk.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin pointed out this afternoon at the 
press conference that China is fully capable of meeting GATT 
requirements, and it hopes that with the joint efforts of the 
GATT Secretariat and signatories, the negotiations for resuming 
China's membership can be speeded up. 
  He said this in reply to a reporter's question. 
  Wu Jianmin said: China's reforms in its economic and trade 
structure over the last 15 years, particularly its progressive 
establishment of a socialist market economic system, have put 
its foreign trade system on a market economic footing and have 
rendered the system more in line with GATT requirements. 
Therefore, most of the GATT signatories agreed that under these 
circumstances, an agreement on China's resuming its GATT 
membership can be reached. GATT Secretary General Mr. Sutherland 
has spoken a great deal on this issue, giving much active 
support to China's GATT bid. China appreciates and commends his 
efforts. 
  Wu Jianmin said: China's reforms in its foreign trade system 
have greatly increased the transparency of its trade rules and 
regulations. In line with its resumption of GATT membership, 
China has done much work in ensuring the transparency of foreign 
trade policies and rules and regulations, making a good start. 
To guarantee the unity and transparency of foreign economic and 
trade policies, all rules and regulations concerning foreign 
economic activities and trade are promulgated by the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC], the National 
People's Congress, and the State Council only. MOFTEC has 
processed and released a total of 93 internal documents still in 
effect and announced the revoking of four batches of documents 
totaling 744. China will also shortly be unveiling its Foreign 
Trade Law. The above facts show that China is fully capable of 
meeting GATT requirements.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here today that China's contracting status in the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) should be restored based 
on the principle of seeking a balance between duties and rights. 
  Li made the remarks when meeting with GATT Director-General 
Peter Sutherland this afternoon in Zhongnanhai, headquarters of 
the State Council. 
  The Chinese premier said that China's foreign trade is 
developing in tandem with the growth of the country's gross 
national product. 
  Preliminary estimates show that the annual import and export 
volume will reach 400 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2000, he 
added. 
  China will continue to import raw materials and primary 
products which are in short supply in China while importing more 
technologies and equipment, Li said, and the prospects for 
China's economic cooperation and trade with foreign countries 
are promising. 
  The premier said that China's bid for re-entry into GATT is 
a 
result of the country's reform and open policies which have been 
implemented since the late 1970s. 
  China's foreign trade regime has basically met GATT 
requirements through its economic reform in more than a decade, 
he said, and China will observe the rules of the Uruguay Round 
and shoulder corresponding duties, while enjoying its due rights. 
  He said that China is willing to resume its GATT membership 
at an early date and will make its greatest efforts to realize 
the target based on the principle of balance between obligations 
and rights. 
  Yet, he stressed, whatever efforts China makes must be in 
line with the level of its economic development. 
  Li cited China's signing of the final act of the Uruguay 
Round and the agreement on the establishment of the World Trade 
Organization as a good demonstration of China's determination 
and sincerity to re-enter the world multi-lateral trading system. 
  The Chinese premier expressed his thanks to the 
director-general and the GATT Secretariat for their support for 
China's re-entry into GATT. 
  Sutherland said that he was very much impressed by China's 
efforts and sincerity in the process of negotiations on its re- 
entry, and he appreciated China's courage in its reform. 
  The GATT chief said he had always believed that China should 
be brought into the world multi-lateral trading system. 
  It will substantially benefit both China and the world if 
China bases its foreign trade regime on the rules of the 
multi-lateral trading system, Sutherland said. 
  China's fast economic growth based on controlled inflation 
is 
not an easy target, he said, and he expressed hope that China 
will make greater achievements in future economic reform.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (AFP)--GATT chief Peter Sutherland 
all but ruled out Friday the possibility of China's rejoining 
the world trade body by the year's end, labelling the schedule 
put forward by Beijing "extremely demanding." 
  While "encouraged" by three days of talks with senior 
foreign 
trade officials here, Sutherland made it clear that China was 
some way from realising its aim to be in at the inception of the 
World Trade Organisation (WTO), which replaces the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on January 1. "It is 
still going to be extremely difficult, with the best will in the 
world, to achieve the timeframe we have spoken of," Sutherland 
told a press conference. "The time schedule is extremely 
demanding." 
  The GATT secretary-general also stressed there was "no 
practical difference" in whether China joined the international 
trading regime on "January 1, April 1 or June 1." "Really what 
we should be talking about is the likelihood of a satisfactory 
outcome at the end of the day. The end of the day being not too 
distant," he said. 
  China, which was a founder member of GATT but left after the 
communists came to power in 1949, has repeatedly made it clear 
that it attaches great political significance to readmission 
before the new year. 
  Sutherland said he had seen signs of "genuine will and 
flexibility" from the Chinese side during his visit, but added 
that doubts remained over the transparency of China's foreign 
trade regime, especially policies governing import quotas, 
licences and standards. "I do not wish to minimise the amount 
of additional discussion that has to be undertaken," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- China's great economic 
achievement has not only improved people's lives, but also 
exercised significant influence on the international economic 
structure. 
  This is the view shared by some well-known foreign 
personages 
who participated in the 1994 China summit which opened in 
Beijing Wednesday. 
  In his speech entitled "Global Multilateral Trading System: 
The Role of the People's Republic of China", Peter Sutherland, 
director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), said that there was no doubt that China's reform 
starting from the late 1970s has yielded good results. 
  "The reforms have given a far greater role to market forces 
and have led to a rapid liberalization of its foreign trade 
regime," he said, adding that the Chinese people have benefited 
from the reforms too. 
  "I am sure that producers, traders and consumers the world 
over, including those in China, are keen to see full 
implementation of these and other announced reforms," he said. 
  Great changes have taken place just after the successful 
conclusion of the Uruguay round multilateral trade negotiation, 
and on the eve of the establishment of the new World Trade 
Organization (WTO), the director-general said. 
  He pointed out that the reforms would help China to finish 
the negotiations on the terms and conditions for its rejoining 
GATT as early as possible, and to become one of the initial 
member states of WTO. 
  "China's ambitious program of trade and economic reforms has 
contributed greatly to bringing China more closely into line 
with the world trading system," he said. "Observing the Chinese 
economy in the process of reform, one sees that China is 
essentially doing autonomously what the WTO would in any case 
oblige it to do." 
  "Given the magnitude of China's economy and the likelihood 
that China will assume a leading role in shaping the global 
economic environment of the next century, I think it to be of 
critical importance that close attention be paid to the manner 
in which China proceeds with its full integration into this 
newly-strengthened multilateral trading system. 
  "China's membership would increase the universality of the 
multilateral trading system and in other respects reflect 
positively on the evolution of international relations." 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed said in his speech 
that Southeast Asia should have no fear of a wealthy and strong 
China. 
  In contrast, "the Southeast Asian countries would benefit 
from a huge market at their doorsteps" since the demands of 
China would increase tremendously with its development, he said. 
  A stable environment is necessary for Asian countries to 
catch up with the Western developed ones, Mahathir said, adding 
that China had set a good example for other countries in this 
regard. 
  "An anarchic situation is neither going to facilitate the 
growth and flowering of a free market, nor help the transition 
from a command economy to a market economy," he said. 
  Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, said in 
his speech that the World Bank would continue to support China 
in deepening its reform. 
  Since the quality and stability of the economic growth is 
one 
of the important elements that would shape China's future, he 
said, the World Bank would finance China in support of 
macroeconomic stability, reform of state-owned enterprises, 
improvement of the infrastructure, environmental protection and 
the development of its poor areas. 
  The World Bank has been China's partner in its reform drive, 
he said. 
  Till now, the bank has supported 130 projects in China, 
involving accumulated finances of over 16 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said in his speech 
entitled "China and the world" that China was playing a more 
important role in current world affairs and economic and trade 
exchanges, and in 20 years, China would become an economic giant. 
  For this reason, he said, all important world organizations 
including GATT should accept it. 
  In order to fulfill its target, Schmidt said, China should 
be 
stable at home and upgrade its infrastructures to empower people 
in the inland and the countryside, as well as controlling 
inflation. 
  He also pointed out that the United States should not 
interfere in China's internal affairs and that it is not wise to 
stop China's most favored nation status.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Ruichang (0491 3843 1603): "China Supports </F>
Establishment of Partnership Relations for Sustainable 
Development"] 
  [Text] Bridgetown, 5 May (XINHUA) -- At a high-level 
meeting of the UN "global conference on sustainable development 
of small island developing countries" held in Bridgetown, 
capital of Barbados, Liu Chengguo, leader of the Chinese 
Government delegation, pointed out that the principle of 
establishing partnership relations for sustainable development 
as defined in this conference should become the foundation of 
international cooperation in the fields of environment and 
development. 
  Liu Chengguo held: The sustainable development of small 
island developing countries is an important component of global 
sustainable development. Small island developing countries' 
efforts to develop the economy and protect the environment 
constitute a contribution to realizing the goal of global 
sustained development. 
  Speaking on how to establish such partnership relations for 
sustainable development, Liu Chengguo said that such relations 
should be characterized by mutual respect and equality in 
treating each other. He said: Large or small and strong or 
weak as they may be, all countries are equal partners in 
international cooperation. Only in this way, can they have the 
foundation for cooperation. If a country criticizes others at 
every turn, always tries to force certain patterns or the 
policies and methods suitable to some countries on others, and 
even regards money and technical aids as political counters and 
puts forward unreasonable demands on the internal affairs of the 
aided countries, partnership relations will be out of the 
question. 
  Liu Chengguo said: In such partnership relations, the 
endeavor to solve global environmental problems should also be 
closely combined with the endeavor to solve the specific 
problems that small island developing countries are faced with, 
and small island developing countries should be helped to attain 
the two goals of sustained economic development and 
environmental protection, which supplement each other. 
  Liu Chengguo pointed out that such partnership relations 
should manifest the principle of "common and yet different 
responsibilities." He said: Changes in weather, rise of the 
sea level, pollution of seas and coasts, and other environmental 
problems are not created chiefly by small island countries, but 
small island countries are the first to suffer the damage. Many 
problems left from colonial or trusteeship periods are still 
restricting their social and economic development. Therefore, 
to effectively solve the environmental problems of small island 
countries and enable them to achieve sustainable development, 
the international community, especially developed countries, 
should shoulder more duties. 
  In conclusion, Liu Chengguo said: As a developing country, 
China has a deep understanding and sympathy toward the 
difficulties small island developing countries encounter. China 
has established friendly cooperative relations with many small 
island developing countries and is willing to actively probe and 
strengthen multiform and multi-layered South-South cooperation 
to realize common development and prosperity. 
  The UN "global conference on sustainable development of 
small 
island developing countries" opened on 25 April. Government 
delegations from 100 member countries of the United Nations, 
including China, attended the conference. The conference was 
held particularly for the purpose of addressing the special 
problems regarding the environment and development of small 
island countries after the 1992 UN conference on environment and 
development.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- China's import and 
export volume has continued to grow over the first four months 
of this year after the implementation of the deepened reform in 
the foreign economic and trade field, a high-ranking trade 
official said here today. 
  Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, 
told the 1994 China summit that the operational order of China's 
foreign trade has been relatively normal and the operation of 
the new foreign trade system has been satisfactory. 
  In her speech entitled "Deepening Foreign Trade System 
Reform, Promoting Sino-Foreign Economic and Trade Cooperation", 
she said that the reform of the foreign trade system this year 
is markedly different from that carried out during the previous 
15 years. 
  The reform this time is being closely coordinated with that 
in other main areas of the national economy, such as taxation, 
finance, investment, planning, foreign exchange and enterprises. 
  "It is unprecedented in terms of scope, dynamics and 
difficulties," she said. 
  To ensure the smooth progress of the reform, she said, it 
was 
necessary to focus attention on the overall situation of 
economic system reform and properly handle the relations between 
the foreign trade reform and reforms in other sectors. 
  It was also imperative to conscientiously handle relations 
between foreign trade development and reform and effectively 
maintain good order in foreign trade operations, as well as 
encourage and protect legitimate competition among enterprises, 
she added. 
  "China has consistently pursued a policy of independence, 
maintaining initiative in its own hands, equality and mutual 
benefit," she said. "We are willing to develop various forms of 
economic and trade cooperation with all countries and regions." 
  At today's meeting, other Chinese officials, including Liu 
Zhongli, minister of finance, Chen Yuan, vice-president of the 
People's Bank of China, Liu Hongru, chairman of China Securities 
Supervision and Management Commission, Huang Ju, mayor of 
Shanghai, Ernest Stern, managing director of the World Bank, and 
Helmut Schmidt, former chancellor of Germany, as well as some 
foreign entrepreneurs, also delivered speeches. 
  The meeting came to a close this evening.

  [Text] Chinese people have been flocking abroad to pursue 
advanced studies since the late 1970s when the country opened up 
to the outside world. Many of them have retuned after the 
graduation. As CRI's [China Radio International] (Zhao Jianpu) 
discovered, China has just set up an information system to help 
make it the best use of these talented young people. Here is 
(Tian Hong) with the details: 
  China has just set up a worldwide computer network to 
collect 
and give information for both the country's talent hunters and 
returned students. (Gong Changshun) from the China Service 
Center for Scholarly Exchange says the information system will 
be a great help for the country in retrieving these talents. 
  [Gong in Mandarin fading into English translation] Gong 
Changshun says the system has come just in time as more and more 
students are finishing their courses and returning home. The 
official says since 1978 when China began its open-door policy, 
the country has sent many people abroad for advanced studies. 
Also a large number of others have gone abroad 
privately-funded. Statistics show that so far the number of 
returned students have reached 70,000. More than 140,000 are 
still studying abroad. Gong Changshun says both the returned 
and those who are still abroad are concerned as to how they can 
best serve their country. But many of them have not found 
suitable positions, due to a lack of information. 
  [Gong in Mandarin fading into English translation] Gong 
Changshun says the computer network covers most parts of China 
and every Chinese embassy and consulate abroad. Due to the 
network, information about the supply and demand of these 
talented young people can be obtained immediately. In this way, 
people can not only find more choices for their skills, but also 
can effectively be introduced into joint-venture projects to aid 
the country's economy. The official says that most talent 
hunters and students who have returned or are still abroad are 
welcome to join the scheme. The hotline number of the network 
is 205-1306, that is 205-1306. 
  For China Radio International, this is (Tian Hong).

  [Text] Changchun, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Changchun City has 
signed an agreement with South Korea's Hyondae Commercial 
Company Limited to establish a joint venture with an annual 
capacity of producing one million dashpots for automobiles and 
motorcycles. 
  The project in this capital of northeast China's Jilin 
Province, where the country's number one automobile plant is 
located, marks a new wave of overseas investment in China's 
automotive industry. 
  Just before this project, the Shanghai Volkswagen Automobile 
Corporation signed an agreement with Ford Motor Co. of the 
United States to produce interior decoration parts for cars. 
  China is described as the world's largest potential auto 
market, as some 270 million families are estimated to be 
potential auto owners. Listed by China as one of the backbone 
industries, auto production is expected to hit three million 
vehicles a year by the end of the century, fueling demands for 
auto parts. 
  As most of China's auto manufacturers started by assembling 
foreign parts, domestic part makers have to greatly reduce costs 
when China approaches its resumption of its status in GATT (the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). Joint production with 
foreign auto makers is an option or even a way out for some 
Chinese firms, experts say. 
  According to an official from the Ministry of 
Machine-Building, most of the China's existing 116 auto makers 
are Sino-foreign joint ventures. He added that China will 
divert auto joint-ventures to auto parts production. He said 
China plans to establish 200 enterprises to build another 200 
auto parts production plants within the century, and so 
Sino-foreign co-operation, he said, will be of vital importance. 
  in light of the growing Chinese market, Ford of the United 
States set up a special department to deal with Chinese business 
this year. General Motors started a joint venture to make auto 
parts in Beijing this April and another two ventures are being 
discussed with Chinese partners in Henan and Shenyang. Similar 
Sino-foreign auto parts enterprises have also been established 
by companies from France and other countries.

  [Text] Washington, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
today refused to recognize the new Haitian president installed 
by that country's military on Wednesday, dismissing the action 
as "purely illegitimate." 
  State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry told a news briefing 
that it was clearly "an illegitimate act by this rump group in 
Haiti." 
  The Haitian military arranged for their allies in parliament 
to install on Wednesday 80-year-old Supreme Court Justice Emil 
Jonassaint as that country's head of state to replace exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  The Organization of American States (OAS) issued on 
Wednesday 
night a strong declaration condemning the Haitian military's 
action as "contrary to the majority will of the Haitian people." 
  "Any action taken by the illegitimate government, including 
any call to elections, will be deemed entirely invalid," the 
declaration said. 
  McCurry said the OAS declaration is "a united statement on 
behalf of the hemisphere which categorically rejects the actions 
that have been taken by this rump group in attempting to install 
an illegitimate provisional president in Haiti." 
  "I think the standing of the UN Security Council resolutions 
in effect," he said. "The purpose of the world community is to 
restore President Aristide and restore democracy to Haiti." 
  "That is the purpose of the sanctions that have been in 
place 
and that are now going to be put in place in an even stronger 
fashion," McCurry added.

  [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Beijing has been chosen 
as the host of the Seventh International Anti-Graft Conference 
(IAGC) of October 1995, a senior Chinese official said here 
today. 
  "It is of great significance for China to hold the 
convention," said Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate, today at the founding ceremony 
of the IAGC Organizing Committee, when its first session was 
also held. 
  The top procurator said China has consistently cracked down 
on the crimes of embezzlement and graft in order to build a 
clean and honest government. 
  He claimed that China has achieved great successes in its 
anti- corruption drives since its founding in 1949, especially 
the one since August 1993 till now. 
  According to the Supreme People's Procuratorate, more than 
22,000 corruption cases were investigated between September last 
year and March this year, among which 37 are major cases 
involving more than 1 million yuan each, 789 involve money from 
100,000 to 1 million yuan each and nearly 10,000 cases involve 
sums between 10,000 and 100,000 yuan each. 
  Nine hundred and four officials above the county level were 
punished according to the law in that period, of which 71 rank 
at the city level. 
  Zhang said the "Beijing conference" will not only seek 
academic exchanges, but also promote international cooperation 
to fight against embezzlement and graft. 
  "The problem of embezzlement has been internationalized," he 
said. "China is even more in need of such cooperation in the 
time of reform and opening to the world." 
  Zhang said the motif of the conference will be "anti-graft 
and social stability and development." 
  The international anti-graft conference is an international 
academic meeting for the exchange of experience in curbing and 
imposing punishment upon embezzlement, and research into methods 
for international cooperation. 
  The conference is held every two years. Its participants are 
mainly government officials, judges, procurators, police chiefs, 
lawyers, experts and professors from around the world.

  [Text] Shanghai, may 12 (XINHUA) -- China has contributed 
to the history of bridge construction worldwide by building the 
Yangpu Bridge in Shanghai with the biggest span of all 
cable-stayed bridges in the world. 
  Holger Svensson, a renowned bridge expert from Germany, made 
this remark here yesterday while visiting the Yangpu Bridge 
together with some 100 other bridge engineers from 19 countries 
and regions. These experts are attending the 1994 International 
Symposium on Cable-Stayed Bridges here. 
  He praised the design of the Yangpu Bridge, with a span of 
602 m [meters], as "first-rate", its welding techniques as 
"perfect" and its structure as "excellent". 
  Walter Podolney, a structural engineer with the U.S. Federal 
Highway Administration, said that the erection of the Yangpu 
Bridge across the Huangpu River is not only a matter of pride 
for the entire Chinese people, but also for mankind in 
conquering rivers. 
  He added that so far the bridge still has the biggest span 
of 
any cable-stayed bridge in the world. 
  However, cable-stayed bridges with even bigger spans are 
being built in France and Japan. "So, there is no limit to the 
progress made by mankind," he noted. 
  Dr. Man Chung Tang, a professor at Columbia University and 
chairman of DRC Consultants Inc. of the United States, revealed 
that a cable-stayed bridge with a span of 865 m in Normandy, 
France, is scheduled for completion later this year. 
  Another cable-stayed bridge, with a span of 890 m, in Japan 
is set for completion in 1997, said Man, who helped the Asian 
Development Bank examine all data concerning the Yangpu Bridge 
in 1991. The bridge was built with a loan from the bank. 
  The bridge in France is a concrete bridge, while the bridge 
in Japan is a steel one, he said. 
  But the Yangpu Bridge is a concrete and steel composite 
girder bridge, he said, noting that it is different from the 
above two bridges in terms of structure. 
  Lin Yuanpei, chief architect of the Yangpu Bridge, 
accompanied the foreign guests on their visit to the bridge. 
  Lin said that the erection of the Yangpu Bridge is 
inseparable from contributions from foreign bridge experts. 
  "Yes, it belongs to China and yet it is a crystallization of 
mankind's engineering progress," he said.

  [Text] Washington, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Senate today 
passed two amendments urging the government to try to lift the 
UN- authorized arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Although the two documents called for an end to the 
two-year-old embargo, one urged president Bill Clinton to do so 
unilaterally while the other directed him to first seek support 
from the European allies and Russia. 
  The amendments, both passed with votes of 50-49, have yet to 
be approved by the house and signed by Clinton before becoming 
law. 
  The Clinton administration, which all along favors lifting 
the ban, has failed to register support from its European allies 
and Russia. 
  While the white house "certainly understands the Senate's 
sentiment," Clinton's spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said it refuses 
to do it alone. 
  "The president does not support unilaterally lifting the 
arms 
embargo," Myers told Cable News Networks' "inside politics" 
program. "He thinks that would have implications for other 
multilateral actions that we've taken in places like Serbia." 
  As debates on the unilateral actions were raging in 
Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher was preparing 
for Friday's meeting on Bosnia in Geneva with foreign ministers 
from Britain, France, Germany, Greece and Russia. 
  Although the Clinton administration has time and again said 
it would press other nations to lift the arms ban, it is very 
unlikely to succeed. 
  Visiting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe reiterated on 
Wednesday Paris' strong objection on the ground that, among 
other things, more weapons flowing in would worsen the war, 
endangering its troops in the Balkan republic. 
  France is the largest contributor of UN peacekeepers in 
Bosnia. Its objection to lifting the ban was echoed by Russia 
and Britain, which also have troops in the former Yugoslav 
Republic.

  [Text] Washington, May 11 (XINHUA) -- French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe failed today to convince the United States 
to exert pressure on the Bosnian Muslims to accept an imposed 
peace plan in the Balkan republic. 
  Juppe arrived here this morning to meet with U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher in preparation for a foreign 
ministers' meeting on Bosnia Friday in Geneva. 
  Before his discussions today with Juppe, Christopher said: 
"The best kind of a settlement is one the parties agree on." 
  His spokesman, Mike McCurry, added a footnote to the 
remarks. 
  "It's our view that imposing a settlement on the parties is 
not the best way to bring it about," McCurry told a state 
department daily briefing. 
  The United States also rejected French and European 
suggestions that the international community relax sanctions 
against the Serbian Republic to encourage the Bosnian Serbs to 
cede some of their captured territory. 
  Instead, Washington is calling for tougher sanctions and 
enhanced enforcement of those already in place. 
  "There is a strong argument to be made for increasing the 
pressure of sanctions, either by increasing their scope, or if 
not that, at least their enforcement," McCurry said. 
  France, along with other European Union contributors of 
troops to the UN peace-keeping force in Bosnia, has threatened 
to pull out if there are no prospects of a political settlement. 
  "It's a question of weeks, maybe some months, but it will 
not 
be possible to have a new winter in Bosnia," Juppe said. 
  "The time has come for a peace settlement, there is no 
military solution for Bosnia," the minister said. 
  France has some 6,000 troops on the ground in Bosnia. During 
the conflict, 21 of them have been killed and more than 300 
wounded, reports said. 
  Members of the United Nations are trying to avert an 
escalation of violence in Brcko, another potential hot spot in 
Bosnia, which has seen an increase of troops and weapons by all 
three warring sides. 
  The United States has pinned the major blame on the Serbs 
for 
the two-year bloody war and is sympathetic to the Muslim-led 
Bosnian government. 
  The Muslims are apparently resisting a settlement for the 
time being in hope of rolling back some of lands conquered by 
the Serbs, who now control some 70 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "We think it's reasonable for the Bosnian government to hold 
the view that a cessation of hostilities agreement that doesn't 
have a sunset or doesn't expire at some point might run the risk 
of keeping in place current lines of confrontation, which then 
makes a peace settlement much more difficult to achieve," 
McCurry said. 
  The Geneva meeting will involve Christopher and Juppe, as 
well as foreign ministers from Russia, Britain, Greece, and 
Belgium.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Muslim forces 
today shelled Serb-held Brcko with five rockets for the second 
time in as many days and there is no immediate report of 
casualties and property losses. 
  The local press reported that all five rockets fell in the 
Grchica district, and this was the second Muslim attack on 
Brcko, a strategic city vital as a link between Serbia and 
Bosnian Serbs. 
  The Muslim forces reportedly bombarded Brcko today with at 
least 16 shells, killing four people, including a pregnant 
woman, and injuring 10. 
  Brcko, in north Bosnia, is a vital communications and supply 
line for Bosnian Serbs into Serbia and has been under the 
control of strong Serb forces since the beginning of the Bosnian 
war. 
  Following today's shelling, Serb commander in eastern Bosnia 
Novica Simich met officers of the United Nations peacekeeping 
forces in Bosnia and lodged a protest. 
  Simich suggested that the UN peacekeeping forces arrange a 
meeting between him and Muslim commander in Tuzla, Hadzeim 
Shadzzich, to negotiate an agreement on ending hostilities 
between their troops. 
  At a press conference today, Simich warned that if Brcko was 
bombed again, his troops would return fire with all possible 
means and weapons in their possession. 
  Jovan Zametica, a spokesman for Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic, accused Muslims of using the shelling attack to 
provoke counter-attack from Serb forces in a bid to lure the 
international community into carrying out air strikes against 
Serb positions. 
  Meanwhile, Muslim forces in Tuzla reportedly admitted that 
they had launched the bombing attack on Brcko, but a spokesman 
for the UN peacekeeping forces told a news briefing in Belgrade 
today that it was still unclear who was responsible. 
  Tension around Brcko intensified shortly after the crisis in 
Gorazde calmed down. Both Serbs and Muslims have massed their 
forces near the region in preparation for a major battle.

  [Text] Paris, May 11 (XINHUA) -- UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali today urged the international community to 
try to find a political solution to the Bosnian conflict before 
UN peace-keeping troops are withdrawn from the area. 
  The UN chief made the appeal in a meeting with French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur here today. 
  French President Francois Mitterrand and Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Alain Juppe have recently been considering the 
withdrawal of the 6,000 troops France has stationed in Bosnia. 
  The United Nations has deployed some 45,000 soldiers in the 
former Yugoslavia, 14,000 of whom are in Bosnia. 
  Butrus-Ghali also expressed the hope that the 11 French 
volunteers who have been detained by the Bosnian Serbs on 
charges of smuggling weapons for the Bosnian army will be freed 
as soon as possible through negotiations. 
  Balladur said today that the French government wants the 
volunteers to be released unconditionally. 
  Butrus-Ghali intends to discuss the issue with his chief 
advisers on Thursday and with the "group of contact" composed of 
the foreign ministers of the U.S., France, Britain and Russia in 
Geneva on Friday in an effort to find a political solution to 
the Bosnian conflict.

reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13 May (XINHUA) -- GATT Secretary-General 
Peter Sutherland said today that China has, in his opinion, made 
positive progress in its efforts to rejoin GATT. There is, 
however, still considerable difficulties for China to rejoin the 
organization within a specified time. He said that under any 
circumstances China should, as a matter of principle, be a 
member of GATT and the multilateral trading system. 
  Sutherland, who is in China to attend the international 
symposium on China's strategy for foreign economy and trade in 
the 1990's, told Chinese and foreign reporters that he came to 
China at a time when negotiations on the global multilateral 
trading system have entered a crucial stage. He has had an 
opportunity to hear the progress China has made in its active 
efforts to have its status as a signatory party to GATT restored 
and he was deeply impressed by China's determination and courage 
in this regard. 
  Sutherland said: In 1980, China ranked 31th in the world in 
terms of trade volume. In 1993, it became the 11th largest 
trading nation in the world. If we count the EC as a single 
unit, China would have been the 6th largest trading nation. 
Besides, progress in recent years in legislation and reform has 
further opened up China's trade. A new global multilateral 
trading system will be officially inaugurated on 1 January 1995. 
As a major player, China should play a central role on the 
world economic stage. The world trading system needs China's 
participation. 
  Speaking of the "Foreign Trade Law" China just promulgated, 
Sutherland said: Some of the top topics in negotiations on 
reentry involved the transparency of China's trading system, 
consistency of its trade policy, and a series of issues in 
regard to quotas, licensing, and inspection standards in China's 
import administration. Promulgation of China's "Foreign Trade 
Law" will serve as a positive factor in the process of restoring 
China's GATT status. 
  Sutherland pointed out: Negotiations on China's reentry into 
GATT have entered a crucial stage. Although China has displayed 
determination and flexibility in an effort to accomplish this 
task, whether or not the talks can be completed quickly depends 
on the attitude of the various signatory parties concerned. If 
China wishes to have its status restored by year-end, if will 
have to reach substantive agreements with the various signatory 
parties by the summer. It is not impossible, but will be rather 
difficult. 
  Gu Yongjiang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation who held the news conference with Sutherland, said: 
Some of the obstacles to the restoration of China's GATT status 
are technical, some are political. During numerous talks, China 
has offered its answers to issues involving tariff reduction, 
non-tariff reduction, and transparency of its trade system. 
Some signatory parties, however, have set excessive conditions 
on China's re-entry into GATT. As a developing country, China 
is supposed to undertake the obligations of a developing nation 
and, at the same time, enjoy the corresponding rights as such. 
He said that many difficulties lie ahead in China's reentry 
into GATT. China is, however, confident of reaching its goal 
through bilateral and multilateral negotiations.

  [Text] Damascus, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Syrian President Hafiz 
al- Asad today met with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher who arrived here earlier today on a new tour of the 
Middle East. 
  Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' went to Damascus 
airport to greet the U.S. official, whose ongoing tour aims at 
securing an essential progress in the Syrian-Israeli peace talks 
in Washington. 
  Israel's proposals on the return of the occupied Golan 
Heights is believed to be the main topic in talks between 
Christopher and al- Asad. 
  Israel has offered a phased withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights 
but did not give details on how much territory it planed to 
return to Syria. At the same time, Israel wanted to set up full 
diplomatic relations with Syria. 
  Syria demanded Israel's commitment to a full withdrawal 
before outlining its stand on future relations. 
  On the eve of Christopher's tour to the region, the Arab 
world called for Israel's complete withdrawal from the occupied 
Golan Heights, stressing that peace will not be achieved unless 
it facilitates a comprehensive pullout based on international 
legitimacy and in line [with] relevant U.N. Security Council 
resolutions.

<F P=106> [Report by Chen Yong and Wang Genbao: "Difficult Assignment </F>
of Christopher's New Shuttle Tour"] 
  [Text] Damascus, May 15 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher started a visit to Syria this evening to 
initiate a fresh round of shuttle diplomacy between Syria and 
Israel aimed at expediting the Middle East peace process. 
  Syria attaches great importance to Christopher's visit and 
President Hafiz al-Asad met with the U.S. secretary of state 
immediately after his arrival. 
  According to diplomatic sources here, the U.S. official will 
convey an Israeli reply to ideas and proposals raised by Syria 
in connection with the Israeli peace proposals. 
  The Israeli proposals, the sources said, focus on an Israeli 
troop withdrawal from the Golan Heights in three stages lasting 
between six to eight years, security arrangements and the start 
of a normalization of relations between the two countries. 
  The sources noted that though the Syrian and Israeli 
positions are wide apart, exchanges by the two sides entered a 
new phase to discuss substantive issues such as peace, security 
arrangements and creation of a favorable atmosphere for resuming 
bilateral peace negotiations in Washington. 
  Christopher will try to bridge the gap between the Syrian 
and 
Israeli positions and to encourage both sides to negotiate peace. 
  Syria is said to be insisting on a complete and immediate 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights before discussing 
issues of peace, normalization of relations and security 
arrangements as demanded by Israel. 
  A Syrian official source said his country will renew its 
demand for an Israeli commitment to complete withdrawal from the 
Golan Heights, adding that Syria is not willing to enter into 
either protracted talks or partial settlements because in that 
way it will only prolong the duration of Israel's occupation. 
  The source disclosed that Israel proposes to devise a 
strategy for security arrangements, preliminary steps toward 
peace, formation of a joint committee and creation of contact 
channels with Syria away from the bilateral Syrian-Israeli 
negotiations. 
  In the meantime, political observers here say that 
Christopher's difficult assignment may prompt him to travel back 
to Damascus from Israel if Israel's response to Syrian demands 
is encouraging. 
  Although Syria has repeatedly pledged commitment to 
negotiate 
peace with Israel, Damascus has recently made strong criticism 
of the U.S. Administration for its listing of Syria as a country 
supporting terrorism. 
  Syria believes that publication of the report was meant as a 
means of twisting Syria into offering more concessions in the 
peace talks with Israel.
