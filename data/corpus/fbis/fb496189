  [Text] Geneva, May 16 (CNA) -- The first bilateral tariff 
consultations between Taiwan and Canada under the framework of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ended here Monday [16 
May] in a friendly atmosphere. 
  Director General Huang Yen-chao of Taiwan's Board of Foreign 
Trade, who led the Taiwan delegation to the tariff talks, said 
that during the one-day meeting, the Canadian side again stated 
its support for Taiwan's bid to join GATT. 
  The Canadian delegation was headed by Paul Haddow, a 
division 
chief in charge of tariffs and market access under the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 
  Canada is prepared to give a detailed reply to Taiwan's 
tariff proposals before the end of June and to hold another 
round of negotiations with Taiwan at any time, Huang said. 
  Taiwan proposed to maintain current import duties on certain 
products, and to lower tariffs on some others all at once or in 
batches following its entry into the Geneva-based world trade 
regulating body, he elaborated. 
  During the talks, he pointed out, both sides focused on 
tariff reductions of 837 agricultural and industrial items, 
non-tariff barriers, government procurement, and trade in civil 
aircraft. 
  The Canadian delegation said that the first round of 
consultations will have a positive effect on subsequent talks 
and that Taiwan's plan to begin bilateral discussions on the 
government procurement agreement immediately after its accession 
to GATT is encouraging, Huang reported. 
  Canadian delegates, however, expressed deep concern about 
some of Taiwan's price and quantity-based taxation systems as 
well as protective measures for agricultural products, he added. 
  While Canada asked Taiwan to slash tariffs in line with its 
application as a developed contracting party, Huang said he told 
the Canadian delegation that Taiwan's import duties on 
industrial goods are relatively low and that Taiwan remains a 
developing country in its agricultural sector. 
  The two sides agreed to add service industries to the next 
round of bilateral consultations, Huang noted. In addition, he 
said, Canada showed keen interest in exploring Taiwan's 
telecommunications market. 
  Huang is among a 33-member Taiwan mission here for the fifth 
meeting of the GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership 
application, which will open Tuesday and go through Thursday. 
Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng is leading the 
mission. 
  Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and 
is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 18 (CNA) -- Taiwan has not violated any 
international ban on exports of whale meat, a Council of 
Agriculture (COA) official said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  The COA issued eight permits to export 321 tons of old 
frozen 
whale meat between 1988 and 1993, said Li Jen-chuan, director of 
the COA's Fishery Department. "The meat had been stockpiled 
before Taiwan formally banned commercial whaling in 1981," Li 
explained. The International Whale Commission did not formally 
ban commercial whaling until 1985. 
  Taiwan decided to allow exports of such meat only after it 
could not obtain assistance from the United States and Japan for 
handling the meat, Li noted. Taiwan originally had 450 tons of 
whale meat in its stockpile, but 129 tons of the meat rotted 
while in storage. Local dealers managed to sell the remaining 
meat by October 1993. The last batch, weighing 220 tons, was 
exported to Singapore. 
  Li said the 232 metric tons of whale meat the U.S.-based 
Animal Welfare Institute claimed it had found in the Russian 
port of Vladivostok was not necessarily from Taiwan. "If the 
meat was old and frozen, it might have been transshipped to 
Russia by the Singaporean company which first bought the meat 
from Taiwan," Li said, adding that no international trade rules 
can prevent such transshipment. If the meat was fresh, Li said, 
it might be Singaporean traders who used the Taiwan-issued 
export permit for old frozen whale meat to ship the fresh meat 
to Russia. "We hope the American conservation group can further 
investigate the case before blaming Taiwan," Li said. "It's 
unfair to fault US for failing to prevent whale meat smuggling," 
he added. 
  Li made the statement after the U.S. group, in a Tuesday 
news 
conference in Washington, D.C., accused Taiwan of being involved 
in a smuggling operation orchestrated by Japan's largest whale 
meat distributor.

  [Text] Taipei, May 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan has consistently 
enjoyed a surplus in its farm trade with Japan in recent years, 
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics 
(DGBAS) reported Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Taiwan registered a surplus of US$2.47 billion in its farm 
trade with Japan last year, up 14.9 percent from that recorded 
in 1987, the cabinet-level agency said. 
  Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan grew at an average of 
1.6 percent annually between 1987 and 1993, with the amount 
rising from US$2.49 billion to US$2.74 billion, according to 
DGBAS statistics. 
  Farm imports from Japan, however, declined 18 percent during 
the seven-year period to US$270 million for 1993, the 
directorate said. 
  While two-way trade between Taiwan and Japan has continued 
expanding, the share of agricultural products in total bilateral 
trade has declined steadily, DGBAS officials said. 
  Farm goods accounted for 30.6 percent of Taiwan's total 
exports to Japan in 1993, down 5 percent from the percentage 
registered in 1987. The farm goods ratio to Taiwan's total 
imports from Japan also dropped to 1.2 percent last year from 
2.8 percent in 1987. 
  Husbandry goods, pork in particular, formed the bulk of 
Taiwan's farm exports to Japan, accounting for 46.3 percent of 
the total last year. Aquacultural products followed at 34 
percent. 
  Taiwan has incurred a huge trade deficit in its overall 
trade 
with Japan as it has relied heavily on Japan for the supply of 
machinery, parts and industrial materials. 
  Taiwan registered a record trade deficit of US$14.2 billion 
with Japan in 1993 and the amount is expected to surge further 
to a new high of US$16 billion this year. The trade imbalance 
already hit US$4.96 billion in the first four months of this 
year, according to customs tallies.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, May 16 (CNA) -- Uniglory Marine Corp., 
a subsidiary of Taiwan's Evergreen Group, recently launched 
container service between Taiwan and Argentina. 
  A Uniglory ship made its maiden call at the Buenos Aires 
port 
last week, thus opening another ship connection between Taiwan 
and Argentina. The Taipei-based Chien Hong opened its container 
service between Taiwan and Argentina through South Africa in 
1992. 
  Omar Leirado, spokesman for the Heinlein Maritime Agency, 
Uniglory's agency in Buenos Aires, said that eight full 
container ships have been assigned to ply the route between 
Taiwan and Argentina. "This will initially give us an average 
frequency of one vessel calling at Buenos Aires every 11 days," 
he said. 
  Two-way trade between Argentina and Taiwan totaled some 
US$300 million in 1993.

  [Text] Jerusalem, May 17 (XINHUA) -- [Israeli] Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres said today that Israel will do utmost to 
push forward the talks with Syria even though there was still no 
sense to have areas of an Israeli-Syrian common announcement on 
the Golan Heights [as received]. 
  Peres was speaking to reporters this afternoon jointly with 
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the 
Foreign Ministry after their half-an-hour talk. 
  "We never denied the difficulties, but on the other side 
there are still hopes of opportunities," Peres said. 
  He thanked Christopher for his continuous effort for peace 
in 
the region. 
  He said Christopher's visits had brought new promises from 
both sides for the negotiations. 
  Christopher, who arrived in Israel Monday [16 May] from 
Damascus, said that "we certainly are making some progress" on 
bringing the Israeli-Syrian negotiations back on track. 
  "But it's a very long road, and we are at the beginning of 
the long road," he said. He did not specify on the progress. 
  "There are detailed discussions on both sides on each of the 
consistent points," he said. "Every meeting I have with them is 
certainly a progress that makes a sense." 
  This morning, Christopher toured the new Palestinian 
autonomous region of Jericho to get first-hand information of 
the developments there. 
  "It is really a thrilling event to see the translation of 
realities on the ground and to see the Palestinians taking 
control of the civil administration," said the U.S. secretary. 
  Christopher is scheduled to hold talks with Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin later today. 
  It is still not clear whether he will return to Damascus or 
just return home Wednesday.

  [Text] Cairo, May 17 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher today pledged international support for the 
fledgling Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank area of Jericho 
and the Gaza Strip while visiting the self-rule area, reports 
reaching here said. 
  Christopher, the first foreign VIP to tour the self-rule 
area 
since Palestinian police took over control, said that the U.S. 
had pledged 500 million dollars in aid to the autonomy 
government over the next five years, and had started to equip 
Palestinian police with 200 U.S. Army vehicles apart from 
helping rehabilitate hospitals and schools there. 
  "Much remains to be done and one of the reasons that I came 
here today is to make it clear to our Palestinian friends that 
they have supporters," he said amid tight security. 
  "I must say that it is a tremendous thrill to see the 
Palestinian police patrolling, to see the joint patrols, to see 
the administrators begin to take over," the U.S. official told 
reporters at the Jericho Police Station, which the Palestinian 
police took over Friday [13 May]. 
  Faisal Husseini [name as received], one of the members of 
the 
Palestinian governing authority, expressed welcome to 
Christopher's visit to Jericho, saying it is the first step 
toward building a new Palestine. 
  Also today, Israel formally handed over the government of 
the 
Gaza Strip to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), 
although Israeli soldiers still remain in parts of the strip to 
be turned over to the Palestinians. 
  Zakaria al-Agha [name as received], a member of the 
Palestinian authority that will govern the strip and Jericho, 
and Israeli Major General Dov Gazit signed a two-page document 
to accomplish the transfer of power. No ceremony was held for 
the takeover. 
  A similar handover of power in Jericho took place Friday. 
Under the accord signed in Cairo two weeks ago, Israel is to 
pull out of Jericho and Gaza, handing the areas over to 
Palestinian self-rule. 
  Christopher, who is shuttling between Israel and Syria in an 
effort to promote a peace treaty, met later today with Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on his 
talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad.

  [Text] Singapore, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Singapore Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong urged the West today to stop seeing Asia 
as a threat and trying to slow Asia's growth. 
  Speaking at the opening session of the Asia Society 
International Corporate Conference, which will run through 
Thursday [19 May] with the theme "Waves of the Future - ASEAN, 
Vietnam and China: Opportunities for World Business", Goh said 
if the West continues to see Asia as a threat and tries to slow 
its growth, both Asia and the West will lose. 
  "If the West blocks the emerging Asian countries, especially 
China, from world markets, it will force them to turn inward. 
They will be less open and be less cooperative 
internationally," he said. 
  As a consequence, the West will be threatened not merely by 
the loss of exports and slower domestic growth, but with global 
insecurity, including the risks of losing the assets it already 
has in Asia, the prime minister warned. 
  In his speech, entitled "Asia - Opportunities, Not Threats", 
Goh said China's emergence will be the largest phenomenon in the 
world economy over the next few decades. 
  The entry into the international market by countries like 
China, India and Vietnam has changed the pattern of world trade 
and investment, he noted. 
  Unfortunately, as the prime minister said, the West was 
ambivalent in welcoming and encouraging the growth of these 
countries. Some Western leaders, politicians, trade unionists 
and opinion-makers see Asia's emergence as a threat rather than 
an opportunity. 
  He said attempts to check imports from Asian countries, 
where 
wages were low, betrayed the West's fear of competition from 
Asia and its growing sense of economic insecurity. 
  Referring clearly to the recent efforts by some developed 
countries to introduce social clauses on workers' rights and 
minimum wages into the international trade agreements, Goh said, 
"These thinly-veiled protectionist measures are short-sighted." 
  He said that Asia's growth will be slowed, but it will not 
be 
stopped, given the region's diversity in natural resources, wage 
levels, skills and technology, and capital, as people in Asia 
save more than the rest of the world. 
  He urged the United States to heed what Richard Nixon wrote 
in his last book, that the Chinese may one day threaten to 
withhold most-favored-nation status from the U.S. unless it does 
more to improve living conditions in Detroit, Harlem and South 
Central Los Angeles. 
  "Whichever the scenario, the West would have much to lose by 
not being a partner in Asia's growth," Goh said. 
  The conference, organized by the Asia Society, Dow Jones and 
Company, Inc. and the Institute of Policy Studies, Singapore, is 
attended by some 800 delegates from 21 countries and regions. 
  In addition to Goh Chok Tong, New Zealand Prime Minister 
James Bolger, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Senior 
Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, and Vice Premier of China Li 
Lanqing, and other high-ranking government officials from the 
participating countries are also scheduled to deliver their 
keynote speeches at the conference on Wednesday and Thursday.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Three inspectors of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived here today 
to begin a further inspection of nuclear facilities of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  Eyewitness saw more than ten boxes belonging to the 
inspectors at the airport. The inspectors told XINHUA that the 
boxes contained equipment for the inspection. 
  However, they refused to reveal any details about the 
inspection but said that their activities would last about one 
week. 
  In March, the IAEA inspected the Yongbyon Radioactive 
Chemical Laboratory which is located 100 km north of Pyongyong. 
But the agency is not satisfied with the results and so 
inspectors have to carry out another inspection, according to 
reports. 
  However, the reports say that the new inspection will not 
include monitoring the change of fuel rods at the 5-megawatt 
nuclear reactor.

  [Text] Moscow, May 17 (XINHUA) -- A major new ceasefire 
agreement for the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh was 
signed by Armenia, Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh on Monday [16 
May] in Moscow, Russian news agencies reported. 
  The agreement was signed after talks between Azeri Defense 
Minister Mamed Mamedrafi, Armenian Defense Minister Serzhik 
Sarkisyan and Samvel Babayan, the military leader of Nagorno- 
Karabakh. 
  Under the agreement, that was mediated by Russia, Azeri and 
Armenian forces will stop firing at midnight (2000 GMT) on May 
25 and begin a withdrawal, thus forming an exclusion zone. 
  The agreement calls for the warring sides to pull back to 
form an exclusion zone some five to 10 kilometers wide within 
which 49 observation posts can be established. 
  The three officials, along with Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev, agreed to start posting observers in the region 
on May 24. Peacekeeping forces from the Commonwealth of 
Independent States - the bulk of them 1,800 Russians - will also 
be sent to the area of conflict. 
  In principle, Armenian forces will then start pulling out of 
most of the Azeri territory they occupied in a series of 
sweeping offensives last year. 
  The agreement is to be presented to Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin this week for his approval, ITAR-TASS reported. 
  Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region within Azerbaijan, is 
populated largely by Armenians. 
  The war for control of the region is the most protracted 
ethnic conflict in the former Soviet Union. A senior 
Azerbaijani official disclosed on Saturday that an estimated 
20,000 Azerbaijanis have been killed and a further 50,000 maimed 
since a separatist movement was launched in 1988, which led to 
the declaration of an independent republic in the region in 
September 1991.

<F P=106> ["International Forum" column by Shu Guang (5289 1639): </F>
"U.S. Troops `Cross the Volga'"] 
  [Text] In accordance with an agreement reached betwen 
them, Russia and the United States plan to carry out their first 
joint military exercises in July. The area for the exercises is 
in Orenburg Oblast to the east of the Volga, the "heartland" of 
Russia. It is reported that technical preparations for the 
exercises are almost complete. Even the insignias have also 
been made. When the exercises start, the national flags of both 
countries will be hoisted side by side, and the purpose of the 
exercises: peace-keeping '94, will also be clearly written on 
them. 
  However, two months before the exercises, many members of 
the 
Russian State Duma have questioned whether or not it is 
"appropriate" to hold them, and there is also endless debate in 
the press. A major Moscow newspaper wrote on the eve of the 
anniversary of the victory in the Second World War: "In those 
years, the German fascists only managed to come close to the 
Volga, but today we have invited U.S. troops to cross it." On 
the other hand, IZVESTIA gave tit for tat and put forward the 
view: "If the Russian-U.S. joint military exercises are 
canceled, the president will have made a big mistake." The two 
opposed views are not giving in and are pitted against each 
other like the imaginary "red troops" and "blue troops" in the 
exercises. Under such circumstances, President Yeltsin has 
expressed his "understanding" of the doubts of the Duma members 
and ordered the Ministry of Defense to "discuss the issue of 
military exercises with the United States again." 
  It is said that the scale of the exercises is very small. 
Only a total of 250 officers and men on the U.S. side will take 
part in it. Also, they will only be equipped with automatic 
rifles and other light weapons. The cost is $2.5 million. The 
purpose is not to practice coordination in peace-keeping 
activities. [sentence as published] At first glance, the 
exercises do not involve major interests. Why, then, have the 
planned exercises evoked such strong reactions in the Russian 
political arena? 
  Ever since ancient times, the Russian nation has esteemed 
the 
Volga as the "mother of rivers" and a spiritual source. To 
allow U.S. troops, their former opponents, to cross the Volga is 
evidently something more than some people can bear 
psychologically. This is all the more the case today when 
feelings of nationalism are on the rise. 
  People cannot help associating this with other discord in 
Russian-U.S. relations at present. The two sides have not yet 
ended their dispute over what kind of "partnership for peace" 
should be established; and to date, Russia still wants to revise 
the "Treaty on the Reduction of Conventional Armed Forces in 
Europe. The reason for such revision is that the "treaty" was 
reached between the two major military blocs of NATO and the 
Warsaw Treaty Organization several years ago and that if matters 
are still handled according to the original treaty, it will be 
to Russia's disadvantage. Also, since the second half of last 
year, Russia has been seeking "special interests" in the former 
USSR area. However, Western countries have regarded this as a 
signal that Russia is attempting to restore its "former empire." 
The dispute in the Russian political arena over the military 
exercises seems to be merely a minor episode in the current not 
very harmonious relations between Russia and the United States. 
  In the past few days, the "weather" for the military 
exercises seems to have "turned fine." Russian Defense Minister 
Grachev said that the exercises will be held as scheduled. 
However, no matter whether or not U.S. troops succeed in 
"crossing the Volga," it is evidently not easy for Russia and 
the United States to change from being opponents to being 
"partners," because this requires arduous readjustments of the 
interests of each side.

<F P=106> [By reporter Qu Zhihong (2575 1807 4767)] </F>
  [Excerpt] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- China's reform which 
is being carried out across the country and its omnidirectional 
opening to the outside world have enabled its foreign contacts 
to enjoy extensive development. In recent years, the All-China 
Journalists Association [ACJA] also paid close attention to 
bringing into play its own strong points as a mass organization; 
opened up various channels; promoted mutual understanding and 
exchanges and expanded friendship as well as cooperation between 
Chinese and foreign press circles; studied the experiences in 
journalist work gained by every other country and used them as a 
reference; and made great progress. 
  According to a briefing, the ACJA has received a total of 
148 
delegations of foreign journalists from about 40 countries in 
the past three years. Meanwhile, it sent 43 press delegations 
to visit nearly 30 countries. In having their contacts with 
foreign counterparts closely revolve around two themes, peace 
and development, these delegations helped all the people of 
every other country in the world understand China and improved 
Chinese press circles' understanding of their counterparts in 
every other country through exchanges between press circles. 
  After China resumed diplomatic ties with Indonesia and 
normalized its relations with Vietnam, the ACJA organized in a 
timely manner mutual visits between Chinese journalists and 
their Indonesian and Vietnamese counterparts. In its capacity 
as a mass organization, the ACJA carried out numerous contacts 
with Korean press circles before China established diplomatic 
relations with the ROK. Chinese and Korean journalists 
associations sent formal delegations to visit each other in 
1993. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the 
drastic changes in East Europe, Chinese press circles 
established ties or carried out contacts with their counterparts 
in Russia, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, Poland, the Czech 
Republic, and Albania. It also increased contacts with the U.S. 
press circles over the past three years. In 1991, it received a 
delegation of the U.S. press industry association which visited 
China at its own expense. In 1992 and 1993, China organized 
four [press] delegations to visit the United States. 
  In compliance with the guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
instruction -- "In our opening up, we not only must develop 
international contacts but also must assimilate international 
experiences," Chinese press delegations paid attention to 
conducting a survey of the state of foreign press media as well 
as their experiences to use them as a reference. After they 
returned home, they wrote summary and brief reports which can be 
used as valuable reference materials in addition to publishing 
many articles on what they had seen and heard. 
  As regards the contacts with the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and 
Macao 
regions, which have a blood relationship with the mainland, 
press circles on both sides closely follow the issue with 
interest. After the ACJA was entrusted to do so by the party 
Central Committee and the State Council in 1985 and 1987, 
respectively, it received Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan 
journalists who visited the mainland. Under the guidance of the 
principles "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two 
systems," it established extensive contacts with press circles 
in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao and promoted two-way exchanges. 
  The ACJA received a total of more than 1,400 well-known 
journalists and figures from Taiwan press circles and more than 
1,700 well-known journalists and figures from Hong Kong and 
Macao press circles over the past three years. With the 
assistance of the ACJA and with its coordination, Taiwan, Hong 
Kong, and Macao journalists traveled all over the motherland and 
participated in the report on the sessions of the National 
People's Congress, the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, and the 14th 
National CPC Congress and on other important activities, thereby 
enabling the people in the Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao regions 
to have a better understanding of the motherland's reform, 
opening up, and investment environment as well as of China's 
5,000-year-old history and culture. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Foreign investors hope 
that China will continue to deepen its reforms as an effort to 
keep its economy on a healthy track, according to some 
participants in the just-concluded 1994 China summit. 
  Representatives at the summit from well-known multinational 
corporations stressed this point in their speeches. 
  Hubert Demestier from the Total oil company of France said 
that the changing needs of the Chinese society resulted from the 
development of its economy, its demands for energy were on the 
rise, and the energy mix was also changing. 
  "As an international oil company having been active in Asia 
for 40 years, Total has closely followed the gradual reform of 
the Chinese economy," he said, adding that the company was the 
first foreign oil company to find and develop oil in cooperation 
with China in the South China Sea. 
  "We appreciate the quality of the Chinese industry and the 
very high standards applied in oil exploration and production," 
he said. 
  Demestier pointed out that in order to keep the enthusiasm 
of 
foreign investors in the oil production field, the Chinese 
Government should be flexible to optimize crude supply, refinery 
operation and product sales. 
  Philip Tose, chairman of Peregrine Investments Holdings 
Company from Hong Kong, said that a period of growth in the 
Chinese economy must call for a dramatic transformation of its 
physical and financial infrastructure, and it is necessary for 
China to invest heavily in its infrastructure now. 
  According to the forecast of the company, at least 230 
billion U.S. dollars will be required in China between now and 
the year 2000. 
  Tose pointed out that during the period, the domestic 
capital 
would account for 80 to 90 percent of the total investment, and 
about 35-40 billion U.S. dollars would come from abroad. 
  In order to absorb foreign funds, he said, the allowed rates 
of return in China should be competitive with those available 
elsewhere. 
  "We believe that it would be wise to develop as large a role 
as possible for portfolio investment in financing the deficits 
China will see," he added. 
  Shanghai's history of being a cosmopolitan financial and 
trade center along with recent developments such as the 
launching of a bond futures contract make it a logical choice to 
collect international and domestic funds and channel those funds 
into infrastructure-related bonds and corporate bond issues, 
Tose said. 
  Vincent Tan Chee Yioun, chief executive officer of the 
Malaysian Berjaya group, said that the Chinese economy has 
undergone tremendous growth and transformation and, coupled with 
its huge population and land area, excellent and significant 
business opportunities were available. 
  "It is in China's best interest to continue developing upon 
its present policy," he said, adding that under the support of 
the Malaysian Government, the group had earmarked a sum of 100 
million U.S. dollars for direct investment in China. 
  "Being new in opening its economy to the world, China has a 
very short `track record' for investors to ascertain likely 
future policy direction," he said. "It is therefore more 
critical for China to consciously demonstrate its long-term 
desire to attract and retain foreign investors as partners in 
China's development and modernization process." 
  T.T. Tsui, chairman of the New China Hongkong Capital 
Limited 
Company, said that in recent years, Hong Kong has invested 
greatly on the mainland, and the investment from the mainland to 
Hong Kong, which now reaches around 20 billion U.S. dollars, was 
increasing significantly as well. 
  "The close relations between the two sides were set up on 
the 
basis of the achievement China had made over the last 15 years," 
he said. "Without reform and opening, the bilateral ties could 
not develop so smoothly." 
  Overseas expansion of Chinese enterprises would be 
inevitable 
in the future, he said, adding that since the mainland companies 
were familiar with Hong Kong, it was very natural for them to 
increase their presence in the Hong Kong market.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (CNS) -- The chief of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Mr. Peter Sutherland made 
clear today that the world's multilateral trade system needed 
participation by China. He was convinced that a satisfactory 
settlement for restoration of China's status as a signatory to 
GATT would be eventually made. The GATT chief said that he 
hoped this day would not be too far away. 
  Mr. Sutherland made the remarks in a joint press conference 
with the Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation 
and head of the negotiation group on restoration of China to 
GATT Mr. Gu Yongjiang. 
  Earlier, the GATT chief when delivering a speech in an 
international seminar held here expressed his support for 
resumption of China's status in the world trade organization. 
He made the commitment in his capacity as the head of GATT and 
said that the secretariat of the world trade body would try its 
best to achieve this end. 
  Following the final accord on the Uruguay round talk was 
signed, talks on China's restoration to GATT and its status in 
the world's multilateral trade system entered into a crucial 
stage. Should China have to complete the process for its 
restoration to GATT by the end of this year, a substantive 
accord would have to be reached by this summer. [paragraph as 
received] 
  Mr. Sutherland was convinced that the progress was quite 
positive for China to move toward the resumption of its status 
in GATT. He stressed, however, that it was rather difficult to 
complete the process within a limited period of time which 
needed much more flexibility for a solution to existing 
problems. [sentence as received] 
  The GATT official pointed out that he was impressed by the 
positive attitude shown by China in its determination to return 
to the world trade body. He went further, saying that China's 
foreign trade law approved at home was considered a positive 
factor for resumption of China's place in GATT. 
  He stressed that the world trade system had to be one that 
has rules to be abided by. He appealed to developed countries 
for the overcoming of a trend for trade protectionism and to 
developing countries for quick opening to the outside world for 
trade.

  [Text] Washington, 17 May (XINHUA) -- In the past few 
days, a delegation of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 
National People's Congress [NPC] of China, which is currently 
visiting the United States, has had broad contacts with members 
of the U.S. Congress' Senate and House of Representatives, 
high-ranking officials of the White House and the State 
Department, and persons in other circles. Both sides exchanged 
views on Sino-U.S. relations and international issues of common 
interest. 
  In their contacts, both sides stressed the importance of 
developing bilateral relations and hoped that bilateral 
relations would develop and improve. 
  U.S. Deputy Secretary of State (Tanov) met with the 
delegation on 17 May. He reiterated that the U.S. Government 
attaches great importance to U.S.-Sino relations and hopes that 
the United States and China will enter into fruitful cooperation 
in a vast number of areas, adding that the U.S. Government hopes 
that the U.S. Congress and the NPC will strengthen exchanges and 
that existing problems between the two sides will be solved. 
Zhu Liang, head of the delegation and chairman of the NPC 
Foreign Affairs Committee, noted that China also attaches great 
importance to Sino-U.S. relations and that the common interests 
of the two countries are weightier than their differences. He 
expressed the hope that both sides will strive to improve and 
develop their relations in various areas.

<F P=106> ["Political Talk" column article by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 </F>
3768): "It Is Better for Clinton To Be More Realistic"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Clinton has to make a decision on 
China's MFN trading status in about two weeks. Clinton has 
vigorously advocated applying trade sanctions against China, 
saying China must make "comprehensive and substantial 
improvement" in seven respects before its MFN trading status can 
be renewed in 1994, but people in various circles, both in and 
out of government, are more and more aware that suspending 
China's MFN trading status is not in the interests of both China 
and the United States. How will Clinton weigh the pros and cons? 
<H5>  Changeable Policy Toward China </H5>
  In fact, the disadvantages of suspending China's MFN trading 
status are quite clear. It can be seen from the debate and 
practice of various sectors of society that the U.S. and China 
have a common interest in the economic, political, security 
fields, and many others, despite their different ideologies. 
For these reasons, the U.S. has modified its policies toward 
China since last fall to increase high-level contacts between 
the two countries. Clinton held talks with PRC President Jiang 
Zemin when they both attended the APEC forum held in Seattle. 
  However, in the months following the summit, U.S. policies 
toward China and Asia were changeable, indicating that the 
Clinton administration lacked foresight and sagacity in 
formulating its foreign policy and that there were differences 
of opinion within the administration. In a recent leaked 
memorandum to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Winston 
Lord, assistant secretary for East Asian affairs, expressed his 
opinions over policy toward China. Later, it was rumored that 
Christopher may resign to take responsibility for the 
much-criticized U.S. foreign policy. 
<H5>  Clinton Must Save Face </H5>
  Developments over the last few weeks show that there has 
been 
a marked change in Congress, which has adopted an uncompromising 
attitude toward China in the past. THE WASHINGTON POST said in 
an editorial a few days ago that "Congress this year hardly 
intends to urge" Clinton to apply trade sanctions against China. 
  Another development which warrants attention is that quite a 
number of people are trying to design means by which Clinton can 
back down with good grace. A U.S. newspaper quoted a senior 
researcher from the International Institute for Strategy Studies 
saying that "the urgent task is how to save face for the 
president." Another newspaper report said that Clinton's senior 
advisers are working hard to design "a decent withdrawal." 
  A few days ago Banit [ba ni te 1572 1441 3676], former U.S. 
deputy assistant secretary for East Asian affairs, and Geolick 
[zuo li ke 0146 0448 0344], a former deputy secretary of state 
and White House chief of staff, published newspaper articles 
devising retreating tactics for Clinton. These included: 1) 
Using the term "people's livelihood," which includes human 
rights, instead of "human rights" when addressing China problems 
to enable the two countries to find more common ground; 2) 
issuing a public statement that China is beginning its journey 
to prosperity, that allowing China to join regional and global 
economic and security systems is in the U.S. interest, and that 
U.S. policy toward China is far above its economic interests; 
and 3) publicly expressing that the best way to raise the 
Chinese people's living standards is to allow China to continue 
opening to the outside world rather than isolating it. 
<H5>  Controversy Between Ideal and Reality </H5>
  THE WASHINGTON POST was more straightforward. It believes 
that Clinton can keep calling on China to improve its human 
rights situation if only he changes tactics. 
  In his 900-page book "Diplomacy," which has attracted 
attention world wide, former U.S. secretary of state Henry 
Kissinger, who is famous for breaking diplomatic stalemates, 
said that U.S. foreign policy has always exhibited a conflict 
between moral concerns and state interests. The idealists 
believe the state's driving force comes from disseminating U.S. 
values, while realists place state interests above everything 
else. He maintains that it is more undesirable to export U.S. 
values as the Cold War is over. 
  It is more advisable for Clinton to be more realistic. 
American people are more and more interested in taking good 
care of things at home. In fact, Clinton won the presidential 
election campaign by advocating "taking greater care of domestic 
affairs."

  [Text] Washington, 16 May (XINHUA) -- In addressing the 
Congress on 16 May, U.S. Senate Republican leader Dole urged 
President Clinton to immediately and unconditionally extend 
most-favored nation [MFN] status to China. 
  Dole said: "We only have a few days before the President has 
to decide. If possible, the President absolutely should 
immediately announce that he will unconditionally extend MFN 
status to China." 
  He added: The President "should frankly express what most of 
us have known for a long time: It is infeasible to link trade 
with human rights issues. That policy has already failed. The 
President should admit this and continue to move forward." 
  He reiterated that he does not agree with the measure that 
will disrupt [po huai 4275 0975] trade relations between the two 
countries. He believes that it will only lead to unemployment 
for many Americans and cause U.S. companies to lose the 
opportunity to participate in the world's fastest-growing 
economy.

  [Text] Washington, May 17 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Government 
has reaffirmed that it recognizes Tibet as part of China and 
that it will continue to follow a "one China" policy. 
  The remarks were made by the State Department spokesman, 
Michael McCurry, in a statement released on Monday [16 May]. 
  He said, "It is long-standing U.S. policy that Tibet is part 
of China. Neither the U.S. nor any other state regards Tibet as 
a sovereign nation. The U.S. does not recognize a Tibetan 
government- in-exile." 
  In a bid to clarify some provisions contained in the 
"Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995" adopted 
by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in 
late April, McCurry also made it clear that "as both a practical 
and legal matter, it would not be possible for the U.S. to 
establish offices or conduct programs (in Tibet) without the 
permission of the Chinese Government." 
  The spokesman continued that the United States will continue 
to follow a "one-China" policy. "The language in the act 
referring to official visits, including cabinet-level exchanges 
with Taiwan are 'sense of the Congress' and not binding," he 
said in the statement. 
  His statement also described the wording of the 
authorization 
act that the Taiwan Relations Act takes precedence over the 1982 
communique as "equivalent to a `sense of the Congress' and not 
binding." 
  "We continue to honor our commitment to the August 17, 1982 
communique with respect to arms sales to Taiwan and regard it as 
one of the three pillars supporting our bilateral relationship. 
Nothing in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act will 
interfere with our continuing to honor this commitment," he said. 
  The United States remains, he stated, "fully committed to 
the 
three joint communiques between the PRC and the U.S. as the 
framework of our China policy. Nothing in the Foreign Relations 
Authorization Act changes this." 
  The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman has expressed 
appreciation of the above-mentioned statement and hoped that the 
U.S. Government will honor its commitment in real earnest.

  [Text] Washington, May 17 (XINHUA) -- U.S. public 
confidence in President Bill Clinton's handling of foreign 
policy has declined sharply, according to the latest WASHINGTON 
POST-ABC news poll. 
  The poll, which was conducted from May 12 to 15 and based on 
telephone interviews with more than 1,500 adults, showed that a 
majority of Americans now question whether Clinton understands 
difficult foreign policy problems. 
  About 53 percent of those interviewed disapproved of 
Clinton's handling of foreign policy, with only 40 percent 
saying they approved, the lowest rating the President has 
received since the deaths of 18 American soldiers in a raid in 
Somalia last fall. 
  The survey shows that 37 percent said Clinton does not have 
a 
clear foreign policy, with only 13 percent saying he does, and 
full half saying they have no opinion. 
  The critics said Clinton's foreign policy lacks coherence 
and 
has been marked by flip-flops. 
  Overall, 50 percent disapproved of Clinton's handling of 
Haiti, compared to just 31 percent who approved. 
  But two-thirds of those surveyed said the United States does 
not have a clear policy on Haiti. 
  In comparison with his predecessor, Clinton comes off badly. 
Half of those surveyed said he is doing a worse job on foreign 
policy than George Bush, while only 28 percent said he is doing 
a better job. 
  The survey also showed that Clinton's overall approval 
rating 
has fallen from 57 percent in March to 51 percent this month. 
  The erosion in support for Clinton's health care plan 
continued, with 50 percent now saying they disapproved of the 
plan, compared with 44 percent who approved.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Rongdian (1728 2837 0368)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- Meeting with the sixth 
delegation of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] headed 
by Wataru Kubo, SDPJ general secretary and a member of Japan's 
House of Councillors, in Zhongnanhai this morning, Jiang Zemin, 
general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president of 
the state, expressed the hope that China and Japan will make 
constant efforts to promote the two countries' good 
neighborliness and reciprocal cooperation. 
  During their cordial and friendly conversation, Jiang Zemin 
extended welcome to the delegation and said: "I have met the 
leaders of your party on several occasions in Beijing and Tokyo. 
I think senior leaders of our two parties should maintain 
regular contacts which are very important for promoting 
understanding and friendship. I hope your party will regard 
this visit as a new starting point and continue to promote the 
development of Sino- Japanese relations." 
  Jiang Zemin said: China and Japan are close neighbors. 
Developing the two countries' good neighborliness and 
cooperation not only is in line with the interests and 
aspirations of Chinese and Japanese people, but also is in the 
interests of peace and development in Asia and the rest of the 
world. China and Japan should make continuous efforts to 
promote their good neighborliness and reciprocal cooperation. 
  Jiang Zemin spoke highly of SDPJ's perennial efforts in 
preserving and promoting Sino-Japanese friendship, saying that, 
over the years, the SDPJ has made important contributions to 
normalizing Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and promoting the 
healthy development of Sino-Japanese relations. 
  Wataru Kubo said: "SDPJ always attaches great importance to 
its ties with China. We maintain that approaching history 
correctly is an important issue in Japan-China relations. We 
always advocate that Japan should follow the course of peaceful 
development and should preserve and promote Japan-China 
friendship. The purpose of my current visit to China is to 
further promote the development of Japan-China friendship 
through marking the 10th anniversary of the establishment of 
ties between our two parties." 
  Jiang Zemin said: The discordant tone which recently 
appeared in Sino-Japanese relations runs counter to history and 
the feelings of Chinese and Japanese peoples and so it was bound 
to be condemned. "Past experience, if not forgotten, is a guide 
for the future." Only when we approach history correctly and 
insist on preserving Sino-Japanese friendship can the peoples of 
our two countries be friends for generations to come. 
  Wataru Kubo indicated that the SDPJ, no matter whether it is 
a ruling party or not, will continue to have friendly contacts 
with the CPC and the Chinese people, and will also strive for 
peace and development for Japan and China, as well as Asia and 
the world. 
  Li Shuzheng, head of the CPC Central Committee International 
Liaison Department, was present at the meeting. 
  On the morning of 16 May, Li Shuzheng and members of the 
delegation had working discussions on the development of the two 
parties' relations and other issues. 
  Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, met and 
feted the delegation at the Diaoyutai State Guest House this 
evening.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, secretary 
general of Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, 
hoped that Sino-Japanese good-neighborly relations and mutually 
beneficial cooperation will be continuously furthered. 
  He made the statement when meeting with a delegation from 
the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), headed by its 
secretary- general, Kubo Wataru, here today. 
  Jiang, who is also China's president, said: "I have met with 
leaders of your party many times in Beijing and Tokyo," adding 
that constant contacts between leaders of the two parties are 
important for enhancing understanding and friendship. 
  He hoped the SDPJ can further bilateral relations. 
  Jiang noted that the development of good-neighborly 
relations 
and cooperation was not only in the interests of the two peoples 
but also beneficial to peace and development in Asia and the 
world, and so the two countries should further develop such 
relations. 
  Jiang spoke highly of the SDPJ's efforts during the past 
years to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, saying that the SDPJ 
had made important contributions to the normalization of 
Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and the healthy development 
of bilateral relations. 
  Wataru said that his party attaches great importance to the 
ties with China, and the treatment of history is a big issue in 
bilateral relations, adding: "We have all along advocated that 
Japan should take a road of peaceful development, and maintain 
and promote friendship between the two countries." 
  He said that the main purpose of their current China visit 
was, through celebrating the tenth anniversary of the 
establishment of relations between the SDPJ and CPC, to further 
bilateral friendly relations. 
  Jiang said that not long ago, there were inharmonious tones 
in Sino-Japanese relations, which was denying history and 
against the will of the two peoples, and should be condemned. 
  He continued that only rightful treatment of the past and 
advocacy of Sino-Japanese friendship could make the two peoples 
maintain friendship from generation to generation. 
  Wataru said that the SDPJ, in power or out of power, would 
continue to conduct friendly exchanges with the CPC and the 
Chinese people, so as to make efforts for peace and development 
in Asia and the world. 
  Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of 
the CPC Central Committee, was present at the meeting. 
  Yesterday morning, Li held talks with the Japanese visitors 
on furthering relations between the two parties. 
  Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the national committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, met with the 
Japanese guests here this evening and hosted a banquet in their 
honor.

the Political Bureau and the secretariat of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), met with a 
delegation from the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), 
headed by its Secretary- General Kubo Wataru, here this

  The 27-member delegation including 11 Japanese congressmen 
arrived here today at the invitation of the CPC. 
  Ding, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, extended a 
warm 
welcome to the delegation, saying that the SDPJ had made 
long-term efforts for the normalization and sound development of 
Sino-Japanese ties before it set up relations with the CPC 10 
years ago. 
  After the establishment of relations between the CPC and 
SDPJ 
in 1984, he noted, the SDPJ has played a positive role in 
promoting Sino-Japanese ties. 
  Ding stressed that in the current situation today, no matter 
what changes on the Japanese political scene, the CPC will 
positively develop its friendly exchanges and cooperation with 
the SDPJ on the basis of the principles of independence, total 
equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's 
internal affairs. 
  He expressed the belief that the delegation's current China 
visit will make new contributions to the two parties' ties and 
the two peoples' friendly cooperation. 
  Wataru said that his party attaches great importance to the 
ties with the CPC and China. The main purpose of their current 
China visit is to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the 
establishment of relations between the SPDJ and CPC, he added. 
  He pointed out that a sound relationship between Japan and 
China is in the best interests of the peoples of the two 
countries and beneficial to world peace and stability. 
  After the meeting Ding hosted a dinner in honor of the 
delegation.

  [Text] Beijing, May 15 KYODO -- A delegation of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ], Japan's second largest 
opposition grouping, arrived in Beijing on Sunday [15 May] and 
conveyed a conciliatory message to China from Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata. 
  The eight-member delegation headed by SDP General Secretary 
Wataru Kubo met with Ding Guangen, chief of the Chinese 
Communist Party's Propaganda Department, and expressed Hata's 
assurances that Japan will remain mindful of its past aggression 
in Asia, delegation sources said. 
  The message follows Hata's letter last week to Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, in which he tried to repair damage done earlier 
this month when then Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denied 
Japan's aggression during World War II and asserted that the 
1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. Nagano has since 
resigned. 
  Hata restated in a policy speech on May 10 that Japan 
recognizes its "past actions, including aggression and colonial 
rule, had caused unbearable suffering and sorrow for many 
people." 
  Ding was quoted as telling the delegation that "a correct 
understanding of history is the basis of friendly China-Japan 
relations." 
  He added it is undeniable that the two nations have deviated 
from that aim during the 22 years of re-established diplomatic 
ties. 
  The SDP delegation, which will meet on Tuesday with General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin, is on an eight-day visit to mark the 10th 
anniversary of exchanges with the Chinese Communist Party. The 
mission will return on May 22 after visiting Dalian and 
Changchun.

  [Text] Dalian, China, May 17 KYODO -- A large industrial 
complex for Japanese enterprises has been completed in Dalian, 
Liaoning Province, northeastern China. 
  About 70 manufacturing enterprises, mostly Japanese, will be 
invited to build production facilities in the 
2.2-square-kilometer complex in the city's economic and 
technology development district, officials said. 
  Seventeen firms, including auto parts, steel and towel 
manufacturers, have already signed contracts to secure space. 
  About 3,200 foreign firms, including 591 from Japan, had 
established offices or plants in the quickly developing city as 
of last August, they said. 
  As a result, the city's Japanese population doubled to about 
2,000 in the last one and a half years, they said. 
  China and Japan began the joint 3.5 billion yen project in 
October 1992.

  [Text] Tokyo, may 13 (XINHUA) -- Japan should pursue an 
active and creative diplomacy to help establish a new world 
order and settle regional conflicts, the Foreign Ministry said 
in an annual report released today. 
  The ministry's diplomatic bluebook for 1993 said Japan 
should 
make diplomatic efforts commensurate with its international 
position, adding that Japan's influence has grown not only in 
the economic arena but also in politics and in global concerns 
such as the environment and AIDS prevention. 
  The government report, approved by Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's cabinet today, said much remains unsettled in the 
international situation despite some hopeful developments such 
as peace in Cambodia and the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accord. 
  It noted that difficulties remain in regional conflicts, 
including those in former Yugoslavia and Somalia, tension over 
suspected nuclear weapons development on the Korean peninsula, 
the sluggish world economy, and confusion in the former Soviet 
Union. 
  The paper cited the need to strengthen the function of the 
United Nations and the importance of cooperation among Japan, 
the United States and Europe which share the common values of 
democracy and market-oriented economies and whose combined gross 
national product (GNP) accounts for 70 percent of the world 
total. 
  United Nations-led peacekeeping activities have become more 
important as regional conflicts increase; and the success in 
achieving a Cambodian peace demonstrates the effectiveness of 
such efforts, the report said. 
  Japan also will continue efforts to improve its assistance 
to 
developing nations both in quantity and quality as a way of 
fulfilling its international responsibilities, the report 
concluded.

<F P=106> ["News Focus" by Geoffrey Murray: "Japan Vying To provide </F>
China's Planned Bullet trains"] 
  [Text] Beijing, May 13 KYODO -- China hopes to have a 
high- speed railway line linking the capital with Shanghai in 
operation by the end of the century and Japan, France and 
Germany are competing to supply the technology. 
  As the pioneer of the high-speed rail technology with its 
shinkansen "bullet train," Japan is a prime candidate to provide 
the necessary equipment but it faces strong competition from 
France's TGV and Germany's ICE. 
  Shen Zhijie, chief engineer of the Ministry of Railways, 
said 
China has a strong capability in building railways but it needs 
to import some key technologies and equipment, including the 
rolling stock, communications and automatic train control 
systems. 
  Japan, France and Germany all offered certain advantages and 
China would choose the model that best suited its conditions, 
Shen said, stressing, however, that it is still too early to 
predict which country will win the race. 
  Also still under consideration is the way the railway will 
be 
financed, given that the cost of the line is currently estimated 
at more than 8 billion dollars. 
  According to Shen, the possibilities include raising money 
from local and central government sources and business sources, 
as well as issuing stocks or borrowing internationally. 
  The existing Beijing-Shanghai railway, connecting five large 
cities each with a population of over two million, is the 
busiest in the country, with its trains handling an estimated 
five times more passengers and cargo than the national average. 
The line accounts for 2.8 percent of the country's total track 
length but carries 14.3 percent of all passengers and freight. 
  Various local and foreign experts have agreed that the best 
solution is to build a high-speed passengers-only link running 
parallel to the existing track, which would be devoted entirely 
to freight haulage. 
  Running at speeds up to 250 kilometers an hour, the bullet 
train would slash the traveling time between Beijing and 
Shanghai -- the nation's political and commercial capitals, 
respectively -- from more than 17 hours at present to about 
seven hours, Shen said. 
  With rapid economic growth, particularly in the eastern part 
of the country encompassing the coastal development zones, China 
faces severe transportation bottlenecks, opening up the prospect 
for a number of high-speed rail links between key cities. 
  One is already under construction between Xiamen -- one of 
the five "special economic zones" set up in the 1980s to 
spearhead market-oriented economic reform -- and the city of 
Fuzhou some 270 km away, using Japanese technology and a large 
capital injection. The cost of the project is estimated at 2.1 
billion dollars. 
  But China is not only in the market for high-speed railway 
equipment. There is growing demand for subway networks in 
various major cities to overcome the surface road congestion 
that threatens to throttle the country's explosive development. 
  Given the vast distances involved, railways will continue to 
play a key role in the movement of goods and people -- an 
estimated 1.04 billion passengers will be carried on the 
national network this year. 
  Government experts point out that China only has 54,000 km 
of 
track at present for a land mass of 9.6 million square 
kilometers with a population of 1.2 billion people. 
  By comparison, India has 60,000 km of track for a country of 
2.9 million sq km, while the United States, with a land mass 
close to that of China, has more than 200,000 km of railway. 
  The present system can cope with only an estimated 
two-thirds 
of the goods requiring shipment. The Ministry of Railways chief 
economist, Zhang Youmin, estimates that "rail gridlock" cost the 
country more than 57 billion dollars last year. 
  China needs at least 100,000 km of track, Zhang said, and 
current plans call for expansion to 70,000 km by the end of the 
century. 
  The creation of separate high-speed passenger lines to leave 
the way free for freight on existing major lines would be an 
important contribution to easing the strain. 
  In the major cities, meanwhile, the emphasis increasingly is 
on going underground. Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai have 
extensive subway systems which are being expanded, providing 
increasing opportunities for foreign involvement. 
  French and German companies have done very well out of the 
Guangzhou subway development, but Hitachi and Mitsubishi of 
Japan have managed to get their foot in the door. 
  Shenzhen, the most successful of the special economic zones, 
situated close to Hong Kong, is now seeking central government 
approval for construction to begin next year on the first phase 
of its subway system, involving just over 25 km of track linking 
the local airport with the city center. 
  And moving inland, Chengdu and Chongqing in Sichuan Province 
are both seeking foreign technology and capital for their own 
underground railway systems.

  [Text] Beijing, May 14 KYODO -- A Japanese-owned factory 
in Dalian, northeast China, was hit in March by a massive strike 
by Chinese employees seeking wage hikes, senior officials of the 
company disclosed Saturday [14 May]. 
  The officials said the strike, which rocked the wholly owned 
subsidiary of Mabuchi Motor Co., ended after the company agreed 
to a 45 percent wage increase. 
  They said about 6,000 of the company's 7,000 workers 
participated in the strike, which began on the night of March 24 
with female workers walking out of the workshops. 
  The factory's operations came to a complete standstill for 
the following two days, they said. 
  Workers demanded an average hike of 300 yuan (23 U.S. 
dollars) in their monthly salaries, but agreed to a compromise 
proposal worked out by municipal labor authorities, calling for 
a monthly wage hike of 135 yuan (10.50 dollars) to an average of 
about 435 yuan (33.80 dollars), the officials said. 
  They said the demand stemmed from the inflation rate 
exceeding 20 percent recently. 
  The company offered a regular raise of about 10 percent in 
April in recent years. 
  In a related development, a Hong Kong newspaper reported 
Saturday about 2,400 local workers at a home appliances 
manufacturing firm in Dalian, which is partially owned by 
Japanese precision instruments maker Canon Inc., have threatened 
to walk out. A strike was averted when they accepted a raise of 
135 yuan (10.50 dollars) in their monthly salaries.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 18 (XINHUA) -- King Norodom Sihanouk 
of Cambodia left here this morning for Beijing, China, to resume 
treatment for cancer. 
  The king was accompanied by his wife Queen Monique. 
  They were seen off at the airport by first Prime Minister 
Norodom Ranariddh, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, parliament 
speaker Chea Sim and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Xie Yue'e 
[name as received]. 
  The 72-year-old king made a surprise announcement last week 
that he would leave for China on May 18 to resume chemotherapy 
treatment for cancer. Originally, he had planned to stay in his 
country until June 2 and then pay his first official visit to 
China after becoming king. 
  King Sihanouk returned to Cambodia on April 8 after six 
months of treatment for cancer in Beijing. While in Cambodia, 
he launched a number of proposals for peace in order to hasten 
the national reconciliation process.

  [Text] Beijing, May 18 (AFP) -- Cambodia's King Norodom 
Sihanouk returned to Beijing Wednesday to resume medical 
treatment for a cancer that has spread to his bone marrow. 
  Although smiling and waving, King Sihanouk was clearly weak 
and had to be helped down the steps from the airplane after his 
flight landed at Beijing's international airport. 
  Citing "serious health problems" Sihanouk said last week 
that 
he needed to return to Beijing from Cambodia two weeks ahead of 
schedule. 
  The king spoke for several minutes with Chinese officials 
among the welcoming committee before being whisked away by 
limousine. 
  Sihanouk, 71, began chemotherapy and radiation treatment at 
a 
Beijing hospital in October folowing the discovery of a tumour 
near his prostate gland. 
  He has maintained homes in Beijing and the North Korean 
capital Pyongyang for several years.

  [Text] Beijing, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin said here today that closer cooperation in the field of 
petroleum between China and Saudi Arabia, two major oil 
producers, will benefit both of them. 
  Jiang said this when meeting with Hisham Nazir, minister of 
petroleum and mineral resources of Saudi Arabia, here this

  China and Saudi Arabia share many common interests in 
safeguarding world peace and promoting world development, Jiang 
said. A sustained friendship and cooperation based on the five 
principles of peaceful co-existence are not only in line with 
common wishes of the two peoples, but beneficial to world peace

Government is willing to strengthen its cooperation with China 
in various fields, and especially supports Saudi Arabian oil 
enterprises' cooperation with Chinese partners.

  [Text] Colombo, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Sri Lanka's main 
opposition leader Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike will soon decide 
whether she or her daughter Chandrika should run as Freedom 
Party (SLFP) candidate at the next presidential election, party 
sources here said today. 
  Bandaranaike was unanimously named party presidential 
candidate few months ago but the 78-year old leader who was 
twice premier in the island country is under increasing pressure 
to step down in favor of her 47-year old daughter Chandrika who 
is now the chief minister of Western Province. 
  But no one in the decision making Central Committee of the 
party will openly ask Mrs. Bandaranake to withdraw from the 
candidacy, and it is very much at her discretion to continue as 
party presidential candidate or to step down in favor of her 
daughter, a party insider told XINHUA. 
  Chandrika's chances as potential leader of the main 
opposition freedom party received a new boost when she led her 
party into a sweeping win at the March 23 southern provincial 
election, the SLFP's only formidable election success against 
the ruling United National Party (UNP) for last seventeen years. 
  Her chances in the party to succeed the mother also 
increased 
greatly since brother Anura Bandaranaike, her only challenger 
crossed over to the government after much infighting, and 
accepted higher education portfolio few months ago. 
  A national level meeting of SLFP's different organizational 
bodies and elected members to be convened next week is expected 
to discuss party strategy for next presidential election due 
before December this year, and Mrs. Bandaranaike is likely to 
make an important speech there, the sources said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 18 (AFP) -- Cambodia's King Norodom 
Sihanouk returned to Beijing Wednesday to resume medical 
treatment for a cancer that has spread to his bone marrow. 
  Although smiling and waving, King Sihanouk was clearly weak 
and had to be helped down the steps from the airplane after his 
flight landed at Beijing's international airport. 
  Citing "serious health problems" Sihanouk said last week 
that 
he needed to return to Beijing from Cambodia two weeks ahead of 
schedule. 
  The king spoke for several minutes with Chinese officials 
among the welcoming committee before being whisked away by 
limousine. 
  Sihanouk, 71, began chemotherapy and radiation treatment at 
a 
Beijing hospital in October folowing the discovery of a tumour 
near his prostate gland. 
  He has maintained homes in Beijing and the North Korean 
capital Pyongyang for several years.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Sixty-five British 
companies with offices in Beijing today set up a chamber of 
commerce to "help promote trade relations with China," Chamber 
Chairman Brian Outlaw announced here today. 
  Outlaw, general manager of the British BP Petroleum 
Development Ltd., said the Chinese Government's decision to 
approve the official inauguration of the British Chamber of 
Commerce in China (BCCC) "is a mark of the increased importance 
of Sino-British trade relations." 
  It is learnt that British exports to China in 1993 were 72 
percent higher than the previous year. Several large contracts 
have been signed so far this year, including one for digital 
technology equipment and another for a submarine cable laying 
vessel, he said. 
  Senior officials from the China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade, the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation were guests at the 
inauguration reception.

<F P=106> [By reporters Xu Furui (6079 4395 3843) and Wu Ping (0702 </F>
1627)] 
  [Text] Stockholm, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Troedsson, speaker of 
the parliament of the Kingdom of Sweden, met with Li Ruihuan, 
visiting chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], in the 
parliament building this afternoon. In a friendly atmosphere, 
the two recalled the traditional friendship between China and 
Sweden and expressed their hope that the two countries will 
enjoy constantly growing bilateral relations. 
  Li Ruihuan said: Sino-Swedish exchanges date back to ancient 
times, and the Chinese and Swedish people have always had 
friendly feelings for each other. Sweden was one of the first 
of the group of Western countries which established diplomatic 
relations with New China, and the Chinese people have always 
spoken highly of this fact. Since the establishment of 
diplomatic relations, the two countries have attained remarkable 
achievements in exchanges and cooperation in all fields. I hope 
that bilateral relations will grow further on the basis of 
equality and mutual benefit. 
  Li Ruihuan said: China has achieved fairly great economic 
development over the last decade and more since it started the 
policy of reform and opening up. However, it still has a long 
way to go before it can truly become prosperous. "We are 
striving for sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
Therefore, we need a peaceful international environment and a 
stable political and social order at home. While engaging in 
economic construction, we attach great importance to 
strengthening socialist democracy and the legal system." The 
CPPCC is playing an increasingly important role in this regard. 
  Li Ruihuan briefed Troedsson on the CPPCC's functions, 
status, and role. 
  Troedsson said: Swedish-Chinese relations have grown 
constantly in recent years with a constant expansion of 
bilateral cooperation, a constant increase in trade volume and 
investment projects, and very active cultural exchanges. The 
facts prove that cooperation and exchanges conform to the 
fundamental interests of the people of both countries. She 
said: Chairman Li Ruihuan is visiting Sweden at a time when the 
Swedish people are becoming more and more interested in China. 
This fact is no doubt very helpful to the mutual understanding 
between the two peoples and to the mutually beneficial 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Troedsson gave a luncheon for Li Ruihuan.

  [Text] Taiwan's importers of corn and soybeans, 
retaliating against the U.S. ban on import of wildlife products, 
threatened Friday [13 May] to take their business worth about $1 
billion a year away from the United States. The Taiwan Feed 
Industry Association and the Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers 
Association lodged protests with Washington's unofficial embassy 
in Taipei over the U.S. ban on wildlife product imports from 
Taiwan. 
  President Bill Clinton announced the ban, worth up to $25 
million a year, last month in response to the island's continued 
trade in products made from endangered tigers and rhinos. 
  A spokesman for the Taiwan Feed Industry Association said if 
there is no goodwill response from the United States, his 
association will give priority to South Africa, Thailand, 
Central American countries, and Australia when buying corn and 
soybeans. The two associations of Taiwan's many importers of 
corn and soybeans buy 5 million and 2 million tons a year. ROC 
[Republic of China] officials have denounced the U.S. move as 
unjust after Mainland China eluded sanctions.

17 May China DAILY REPORT, page 1, column 1, headlined "Jiang 
Urges Tokyo, Beijing To Put Nagano Remarks in Past"] 
txt}[Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin on Tuesday [17 May] urged Japan and China to put the 
remarks of former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano behind them 
and move forward with the development of friendly bilateral 
relations for the future, Japanese officials said. 
  "Let's put the Nagano remarks in the past and move ahead 
thinking of the future," Jiang told Wataru Kubo, secretary 
general of Japan's No. 2 opposition party, the Social Democratic 
Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ]. 
  Kubo on Monday delivered a letter to Jiang from Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata expressing regret over Nagano's claim that 
the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. 
  Jiang told Kubo that he appreciated the apology from Japan. 
  Regarding concerns that North Korea may be trying to build a 
nuclear arsenal, Kubo said he hopes the issue could be resolved 
through dialogue and he had expectations for China's role in 
unlocking the stalemate. 
  Jiang also hoped to see the issue resolved through 
negotiations but cautioned the international community should 
not overestimate China's influence on North Korea. 
  "Looking forward to a resolution through dialogue, China 
hopes to play a positive role," Jiang said but added, "it is 
unrealistic to overestimate China's role." 
  Jiang told Kubo that China, North Korea's only major ally in 
the world, wants to see a stable Korean peninsula free of 
nuclear arms. 
  Kubo is currently in China on an eight-day visit through 
Sunday as head of an SDPJ delegation marking the 10th 
anniversary of the party's exchanges with China's Communist 
Party. 
  He told Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan in a 
meeting later Tuesday that China should join working-level 
negotiations among North and South Korea, the United States and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency on concerns over North 
Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program. 
  Tang replied that talks between the United States and North 
Korea will be effective in resolving the issue, SDP officials 
said. 
  Tang also said that China is making an effort to bring about 
a third round of high-level talks between the U.S. and North 
Korea, and that he wants the SDP to work on the U.S. through the 
Japanese Government. 
  Kubo is expected to meet with Hata after returning to Tokyo, 
according to government sources in Tokyo.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman today dismissed the film about China's 
prisons shot by the British Broadcasting Corporation TV as 
"sheer fabrication." 
  The spokesman said that it is very sinister for a handful of 
people hostile to China to go out of their way to smear China 
with fabricated stories under the current situation. 
  The spokesman made the statement in answer to a question 
about a TV film shown by the BBC on May 16 that alleged that 
"China has 10 million prisoners who are in desperate conditions." 
  The programme was made by British reporter Sue 
Lloyd-Roberts, 
who said she shot the film with a concealed camera while she was 
in Xinjiang. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that "this is sheer 
fabrication." According to information provided by the relevant 
Chinese Government department, he said, the total number of 
prisoners in China is slightly over one million -- about the 
same number as in the United States. 
  The spokesman said that "It is the consistent practice of 
China's law enforcing department to provide humanitarian 
treatment to prisoners and run the prisons in a civilized manner 
in keeping with the law." 
  "Under the current situation, a handful of hostile people in 
the world have gone out of their way to smear China with 
fabricated stories. Their motive is very sinister," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- The video made by Henry 
Wu and a reporter of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) 
on the No. 2 Prison in Xinjiang, televised by the BBC yesterday, 
was sheer fabrication, a Chinese Government spokesman said today. 
  The spokesman for the Judicial Department said that the 
video 
was created by means of substituting one thing for another. 
  He said that the film showed the gate to the Xinjiang No. 2 
Prison, located in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region. 
  He said that the gate is near a street, with a number of 
shops and booths nearby, all of which are not related to the 
prison. 
  But the producers of the video pictures deliberately 
montaged 
the gate with these shops and booths, he said. 
  They also claimed that the leather jackets and children's 
clothing available in the shops and booths were export products 
made by the prisoners, he added. 
  The fact is that a factory attached to the prison only 
produces some toothpaste for use in the prison, and that the 
factory has never turned out any leather jackets or children's 
clothing. 
  The spokesman pointed out that the pictures showed some tomb 
sites and a few tomb tablets, with the intention of giving 
viewers the impression that they were prisoners' graves. 
  But the recognizable inscriptions on tablets, bearing words 
such as "the tomb of Wu Jiafeng's mother," and similar 
inscriptions, proved that they are tombs of local residents. 
  The video pictures even claimed that more than ten million 
Chinese prisoners were now serving prison terms in Xinjiang, he 
said. 
  He said that there are some one million prisoners serving 
prison terms in the whole of China, slightly more than one-tenth 
of the figure alleged in the story. 
  Xinjiang has a population of 15 million. "So how could it be 
possible that ten million prisoners are serving their sentences 
there?" he asked. 
  " It's really ridiculous for the video makers to make such a 
fabrication," he said. 
  The video also said that one-third of goods available in the 
shops and stores in Xinjiang were products from the region's 
prisons and they account for half of the exports of Xinjiang, 
but the film did not show any of these alleged exports. 
  That means that Henry Wu was just spreading rumors, he said. 
  He pointed out that this was not the first time that Henry 
Wu 
had come to China using different names and making sensational 
news by cutting and matching unrelated pictures, so as to 
achieve ulterior purposes. 
  The stand of the Chinese Government is clear and consistent 
on the issue of prison-labour products, the spokesman said, 
adding that it is only futile for Henry Wu and others to spread 
such rumors on that issue.

<F P=106> [By reporter He Jingsong (6320 0513 2646)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- China has achieved a 
breakthrough in the automation of translations by intelligent 
machines. The soundness of the cycle from basic research and 
technical development to the market has enabled machine 
translation, an achievement from research in high technology, to 
be quickly turned into products and has enabled the language 
information processing industry to take its initial shape in 
China. The products are marketed at home and abroad, earning 
profits of more than $5 million every year. 
  According to a briefing, the machine translation system is 
one that uses a computer's understanding of the meaning of human 
languages and words to complete the process of changing one 
language into another for people. It is an integrated science 
that involves various branches of learning, including 
linguistics, computational linguistics, and computing 
technology, and it has been listed at the top of the world's 10 
greatest high technologies in the 21st century by an 
authoritative international organization. Other countries have 
invested huge capital in its development. The competition in 
this field is very keen. Chen Zhaoxiong [7115 5128 7160], a 
researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS], solved a 
series of technical problems and initiated a system for the 
theory on translation with the aid of an intelligent machine 
through his explorations in theoretical research and in an 
overall plan. As a result, he laid a foundation for converting 
the achievement from research into this high technology into 
products. In 1992, the CAS set up a special task force 
concerning the project of the application of an intelligent 
machine translation system. After two years' hard work, it 
completed the transition from the system for the theory on 
translation with the aid of an intelligent machine to an 
application system. The project was appraised by the State 
Science and Technology Commission as taking a leading place both 
at home and abroad. The rate of accuracy of its translation 
reached 83 percent, thus surpassing the maximum capability -- 70 
percent -- of machine translation's accuracy which had long been 
held by international machine translation circles. The project 
won an award for scientific and technological advance, first 
degree, from the CAS for its achievement. 
  To expedite the industrialization of the application system 
of intelligent machine translation by converting it into 
products as quickly as possible so as to gain investment returns 
from the market for input into new research and development and 
to enable a sound cycle to take shape, Chen Zhaoxiong set his 
goal on a pocket electronic translation machine. Though such a 
product had broad prospects for capturing the market both at 
home and abroad, it encountered two long-standing technical 
problems, namely, a low rate of translation accuracy and a long 
period for development. It took two years to complete a system 
for the crudest model of machine translation. Taking advantage 
of its abundant technical forces, the CAS concentrated its 
efforts on tackling the problems. In two months' time, it 
completed the development of the system, solved the two major 
technical problems of compressing the vast vocabulary into the 
space restricted by a pocket machine and turning out a real-time 
translation, and successfully developed the world's first 
intelligent machine translation product -- the Kuaiyitong [fast 
translation master] 863A pocket electronic translation machine 
-- thereby attaining the goal of translating English into 
Chinese through a machine. Such a new product is capable of 
displaying on the screen a Chinese sentence corresponding to its 
English sentence within a few seconds after the latter is 
entered onto the keyboard, complete with simultaneous 
pronunciations in English and Mandarin. Shortly after 10,000 
Kuaiyitong units were marketed in Hong Kong, they were all sold. 
At present, the product enjoys sales of 1,000 units a day on 
the international market. The big economic returns produced 
from quickly turning an achievement from high technology theory 
into products attracted businessmen from both at home and 
abroad; one after another, they requested a joint venture and 
cooperation. The Institute of Computing Technology of the CAS 
set up the Kezhi Company in a timely manner to conduct 
joint-venture development with foreign businessmen. It earned 
$4.44 million for the state from the technical licensing of the 
pocket intelligent English-Chinese translation system alone. To 
date, it is the project that has earned the highest amount of 
foreign exchange for China from the transfer of rights to use a 
type of software. So far, the Kezhi Company has also developed 
an intelligent Chinese- English machine translation system. It 
has also successively started the research and development of 
Russian-Chinese and German-Chinese machine translation systems, 
a combination system for phonetic sound identification, and 
other projects, and it has made very good progress.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Briefing" by Geoffrey Crothall] </F>
  [Text] China's economic czar Zhu Rongji is often portrayed 
as a stern, tough-minded politician, totally preoccupied with 
the arduous task of getting to grips with China's economic 
problems. However, students at Beijing's prestigious Qinghua 
University saw the lighter side of the executive Vice-Premier a 
few weeks ago when he gave a speech at the university's economic 
management institute. 
  Mr Zhu, who happens to be president of the institute as well 
as governor of the People's Bank of China and a member of the 
politburo's standing committee, demonstrated that he not only 
had a detailed and comprehensive understanding of China's 
economic and financial system, but also a sense of humour. In 
discussing China's complex tax reforms which are being 
implemented this year, Mr Zhu noted that changing the tax system 
was the "most unpopular" and potentially dangerous of all 
economic reforms. 
  "Three Japanese governments have fallen because of attempts 
to reform the taxation system. In Britain, Mrs [Margaret] 
Thatcher was forced out because of the poll tax and I myself 
have already started preparing for my own demise," he said. 
"However, at the moment things are looking good and no major 
problems have emerged," he added, much to the relief of his fans 
in the audience. 
  In a nearly two-hour address, regularly interrupted by 
enthusiastic bursts of applause, Mr Zhu covered everything from 
the stock market to loss-making enterprises and financial reform 
and even found time to throw in a few jokes. For example, have 
you heard the one about the Soviet financial system? "Our old 
financial system was transplanted here from the old Soviet Union 
and the main characteristic of that system's accounting methods 
was that you could never actually be sure whether you had made 
money or lost money," Mr Zhu said. 
  On a more serious note, the Vice-Premier quickly pointed out 
that China's accounting system was rapidly being brought in line 
with international standards. Some Western observers may have 
found this last comment rather more amusing but no one at 
Qinghua appeared to be laughing. In spite of the jokes, Mr Zhu 
was clearly not amused with the way many enterprise managers 
were blindly climbing on board the stock bandwagon. 
  "Several enterprises leaders are not concentrating on 
improving management, but are thinking up all sorts of schemes 
to transform their business into a stock holding company," Mr 
Zhu said. "The result is the blind expansion of production, 
Ieading to an oversupply of products and huge amounts of waste," 
he added.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yin Hongzhu (1438 7703 4376)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- Li Lanqing, member of the 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council vice 
premier, on 7 April went to Beijing Agricultural University to 
learn about the state of the educational reform and development 
of the university. Li Lanqing took part in a discussion meeting 
with leading cadres, teachers, and students of the university. 
He expressed his hope that cadres, teachers, and students of 
the school will continue their efforts to seriously carry out 
educational reform, further improve teaching quality and 
results, turn the school into a first-rate university in China, 
and train more students and create more and better capable 
people for the construction and development of agriculture. 
  Beijing Agricultural University was founded in 1949 by 
combining the agricultural colleges of Beijing University, 
Qinghua University, and Huabei University. It is directly under 
the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture. It has 
botanical, zoological, biological, resource and environment, and 
four other colleges with a total of 29 departments. It also has 
two national-class research institutes and 10 ministerial-level 
laboratories and research institutes. In recent years, the 
school has actively promoted educational reform in a 
comprehensive manner. While strengthening work on teaching and 
scientific research, the school has considered the 
popularization of scientific research findings and the 
development of new and high technologies as important functions 
of the university. The university has played an important role 
in promoting local agricultural construction, the "harvest 
project," and the work of helping poor areas. 
  During the discussion meeting, Li Lanqing heard a report 
made 
by Shi Yuanchun, president of the university, and suggestions 
from professors and experts on the reform of education. Li 
Lanqing fully affirmed the work of the university in training 
people to meet the needs of agriculture and developing and 
popularizing scientific research findings. He said: The key to 
China's agricultural development lies in having advanced 
agricultural science and technology, and advanced agricultural 
science and technology in turn rely on having trained people. 
Our agricultural colleges and schools should become bases for 
scientific research as well as bases for training people. 
Beijing Agricultural University as a university with great 
influence should shoulder a greater responsibility. He pointed 
out that we must not overlook the study of basic agricultural 
science because a good foundation in basic science can further 
promote the development of applied agricultural science and 
technology. At present, agricultural colleges and schools with 
good conditions should start research on important subjects, 
seek breakthroughs, and use their findings to promote 
agricultural development. 
  Li Lanqing pointed out: The current reform of higher 
education should place emphasis on raising the quality and 
results of education. Therefore, we must change the past 
pattern in running schools. We should avoid advocating small 
but complete and should encourage colleges and schools with good 
conditions to cooperate and jointly run schools so as to give 
full play to the advantage of a group and create greater social 
benefits. He said: Beijing Agricultural University has 
conditions to cooperate with other schools in developing 
education. Taking itself as the center, Beijing Agricultural 
University should work together with related colleges and 
schools to make more reasonable teaching arrangements and to 
raise the quality and results of education. 
  Li Lanqing said: The training of agricultural technicians 
should be conducted at various levels. The Ministry of 
Agriculture should place emphasis on running well one or two key 
universities to cultivate high-caliber professionals at an 
advanced level. Meanwhile, it should also improve the existing 
agricultural colleges and special and technical secondary 
schools through reform and develop vocational and adult 
education to promote the development of agriculture, science, 
and education. 
  Prior to taking part in the discussion meeting, Li Lanqing 
inspected an exhibition on scientific research achievements, the 
library, and the agrobiology technology experimental station of 
the university. 
  Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang; Xu Zhijian, State Council 
deputy secretary general; and Wang Mingda, State Education 
Commission vice minister, also took part in the discussion 
meeting.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chu Baoping (2806 0202 1627)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- While it will soon be 
"1 May" International Labor Day, the Ministry of Power Industry 
and Ministry of Chemical Industry separately held meetings on 
commending model workers and advanced collectives of their 
respective industries in Beijing today. Vice Premier Li Lanqing 
attended both meetings and had group photos taken with those 
representatives present. 
  Li Lanqing said: Since the start of reform and opening up, a 
great deal of good technology and management expertise has been 
introduced into our country. However, it is unavoidable that a 
few flies will get into the house when the windows are open. 
For this reason, it is even more necessary to step up the 
building of spiritual civilization, and strengthen ideological 
and political work. Some people think we can attract more 
foreign investment with some unhealthy practices; I think that 
it is an extremely big mistake. Tolerating such unhealthy 
things will only worsen China's investment environment. We must 
not permit anyone to undermine our investment environment and 
spiritual civilization with such unhealthy practices as the 
"three companions [to provide clients with female companions at 
dinner, drinking, and dance parties]." 
  He said: Reform, opening up, and the development of a 
socialist market economy have created favorable conditions for 
China's economic development. However, national prosperity is 
the result of hard work, not a windfall. We must emphasize over 
and over that our cause requires the display of unselfish 
dedication and hard work, and it also requires thousands upon 
thousands of model workers to play a backbone and leading role. 
Both the power and chemical industry are China's basic 
industries, playing an important role in our economic life. At 
present, our country should accelerate the development of basic 
industries. 
  The Ministry of Power Industry today conferred the honorific 
title "national special model worker of the power industry" on 
Zheng Changfei and 10 other workers and staff members, with a 
bonus of 10,000 yuan apiece to be issued by their organizations; 
the honorific title "national model worker of the power 
industry" on Tang Zhihong and 305 other comrades, with a bonus 
of 8,000 yuan apiece to be issued by their organizations; and 
the honorific title "national advanced collective of the power 
industry" on 100 organizations, including the No. 1 boiler plant 
of the Qinling Power Plant. 
  The Ministry of Chemical Industry has decided to confer the 
honorific title "national model worker of the chemical industry" 
on Wang Yongan and 379 other comrades; the honorific title 
"national distinguished ideological and political worker of the 
chemical industry for 1991-1993" on Cai Dejun and 99 other 
comrades; and the honorific title "enterprise of excellent 
ideological and political work for 1991-1993" on Beijing No. 2 
Chemical Plant and 47 other chemical industry enterprises and 
institutions. 
  State councillor Luo Gan attended the commendation meeting 
of 
the Ministry of Power Industry. Yu Qiuli, Qian Zhengying, Zhang 
Dinghua, and other leading comrades concerned also attended 
today's meeting.

  [Text] Hefei, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Anhui Province, a rising 
economic power in east China, is speeding up construction of 
railways, highways, airports and harbors to pave the way for an 
economic uplift around the turn of the century. 
  A provincial government official said that over the past few 
years, Anhui has spent billions of yuan building a network of 
railways and roads. 
  To date, new railways totaling 2,000 km have been built to 
link Anhui to neighboring Jiangxi and Zhejiang Provinces, he 
said. 
  A new railway construction upsurge emerged last year, he 
added. 
  Construction of the 200-km Hefei-Jiujiang section of the 
Beijing- Kowloon railway is nearing completion, he said. Hefei 
is the provincial capital and Jiujiang is a major port city on 
the Chang Jiang river in neighboring Jiangxi Province. 
  Another 190-km section of the railway, a top-priority 
construction project, is being built in northern Anhui, he noted. 
  In 1993 Anhui began building and upgrading 91 roads totaling 
2,817 km, he said. These roads will be built at a total cost of 
4.8 billion yuan. 
  A bridge across the Chang Jiang river is being built at 
Tongling, a nonferrous metal production center in east China. 
The bridge will be the first along the 400-km section of the 
Chang Jiang flowing through Anhui Province. 
  The official said that Anhui currently has 30,729 km of 
roads, including 102 km of expressways and 1,120 top-grade 
highways. 
  Now, roughly 99 percent of all rural townships and 80 
percent 
of all villages are connected with roads. The road density in 
the province averages 22 km per 100 sq km, he said. 
  Anhui has also made fresh progress in airport construction 
in 
recent years. 
  The Luogang airport in Hefei has become a modern airport, 
and 
an airport in the city of Huangshan, best known for its 
picturesque Huangshan mountains, can accommodate Boeing 737 
jetliners, the official said. 
  Two airports opened in the cities of Anqing and Wuhu, 
respectively, last year. Another airport in the city of Wuyang 
is being expanded to accommodate Boeing 737s later this year, 
the official said. 
  Anhui currently has regular air services to 20 major cities 
in other parts of China. Air routes now link Hefei and 
Huangshan directly with Hong Kong, he said. 
  The Chang Jiang port cities of Anqing, Tongling and Maanshan 
opened to foreign ships in 1993. Another port city, Wuhu, 
opened to foreign ships in 1992. 
  To date, Anhui has opened ten shipping routes to Hong Kong, 
Southeast Asia, the Republic of Korea, Japan and Russia.

demand on the building of the militia emergency detachments of 
the whole province for some time to come at the provincial 
on-the-spot meeting on the building of the militia emergency 
detachments, which ended in Huizhou yesterday. He said it is 
necessary to build the militia emergency detachments of our 
province into a politically reliable, well-equipped, and 
well-trained contingent with sound organization, with the 
required number of militiamen, and with good supply. In case of 
emergency, the detachments really should be able to assemble at 
the first call, to be ready for combat, to take orders, to play 
their role, and to make contributions to state security, social 
stability, and economic development. 
  The meeting disclosed that at present, the militia emergency 
detachments of our province have a total of 116 companies and 
535 independent emergency platoons. Their organization is sound 
and their education, training, and management are quite strict 
and regular.

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Two Taiwan police cruise 
boats recently completed patrols of the Nansha [Spratly] 
Islands, the first such move by Taiwan Police, according to 
reports from Taiwan. 
  The primary task for the cruise by the two police 400-DWT 
Boats was to survey the waters around Taiping Island and chart 
routes from Taiwan to Taiping in order to provide important 
information for the establishment of a peacekeeping force on the 
island and facilitate future sails for ships and fleets. 
  According to the reports, on patrol were two associate 
geology chief engineers of the "China Petroleum Corporation" in 
Taiwan. They were to survey sites with exploitable oil and gas. 
Meanwhile, a fisheries research boat named "Yuxun No.2" 
carrying 31 oceanology experts joined the cruise. 
  According to reports, the Taiwan regime has reiterated that 
the Nansha Islands are an inseparable part of China and 
sovereignty belongs to China. In December 1992, the Taiwan 
regime set up "the South China Sea Group" and mapped out an 
"outline on South China Sea policies." Such policies aim to 
firmly safeguard the sovereign rights in the South China Sea. 
In September 1993, a large-scale, high-level symposium was held 
on the South China Sea, called by Taiwan's "Ministry of the 
Interior". Addressing the opening ceremony, Lien Chan noted 
that no country can deny the fact that the islands in the South

  [Text] Taiwan's importers of corn and soybeans, 
retaliating against the U.S. ban on import of wildlife products, 
threatened Friday [13 May] to take their business worth about $1 
billion a year away from the United States. The Taiwan Feed 
Industry Association and the Taiwan Vegetable Oil Manufacturers 
Association lodged protests with Washington's unofficial embassy 
in Taipei over the U.S. ban on wildlife product imports from 
Taiwan. 
  President Bill Clinton announced the ban, worth up to $25 
million a year, last month in response to the island's continued 
trade in products made from endangered tigers and rhinos. 
  A spokesman for the Taiwan Feed Industry Association said if 
there is no goodwill response from the United States, his 
association will give priority to South Africa, Thailand, 
Central American countries, and Australia when buying corn and 
soybeans. The two associations of Taiwan's many importers of 
corn and soybeans buy 5 million and 2 million tons a year. ROC 
[Republic of China] officials have denounced the U.S. move as 
unjust after Mainland China eluded sanctions.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "National News </F>
Hookup" program] 
  [Text] On the morning of 10 May local time, Swedish Prime 
Minister Carl Bildt met with Li Ruihuan, chairman of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], in his office. 
  Li Ruihuan said: China and Sweden are far away from each 
other and have no conflict of basic interests. On the contrary, 
there are broad prospects for economic cooperation because the 
economies of the two countries are mutually complementary. 
China is carrying out large-scale economic development, and 
there is much in Sweden's advanced technology and management 
experience that we can make use of. During my visit to your 
country, I have personally witnessed Swedish entrepreneurs' 
desire to strengthen cooperation with China. Our two countries 
should exert joint efforts to push bilateral cooperation to a 
new stage, which corresponds with the common interests and 
aspirations of the two peoples. 
  The Swedish prime minister said that bilateral relations 
between China and Sweden have developed rapidly in recent years, 
and he expressed his hope that they will develop further. He 
also expressed Sweden's support for China's reentry into the 
GATT. [video shows Li and Bildt walking out of a room, then stop 
and stand side by side as photographers take pictures of them] 
  Around noon, Troedsson, speaker of the parliament of the 
Kingdom of Sweden, met with Chairman Li Ruihuan in the 
parliament building. Li Ruihuan said: While developing the 
economy, China pays great attention to promoting socialist 
democracy and legality. In this regard, the CPPCC is playing an 
increasingly important role. Speaker Troedsson said that 
experience has shown that Swedish- Chinese cooperation and 
exchanges are in accordance with the fundamental interest of the 
Swedish and Chinese peoples. [video shows Li and Troedsson 
standing together, with glasses in hand, and speaking through an 
interpreter] 
  In the afternoon, Chairman Li Ruihuan met with Swedish 
Minister of Foreign Trade Dinkelspiel. 
  After successfully concluding his visit to Sweden, Chairman 
Li Ruihuan left Stockholm by a special plane and, less than an 
hour later, arrived at (Kathmond) Airport in Oslo. Upon his 
arrival, Chairman Li Ruihuan said in a written statement that 
China attaches importance to developing exchanges and 
cooperation with Norway in all fields. China wishes to develop 
a long-term, stable friendship with Norway. 
  Bjorn Tore Godal, Norwegian acting prime minister and 
foreign 
minister, greeted Chairman Li Ruihuan and his entourage in the 
hall of the hotel where Chairman Li is staying. 
  Chairman Li Ruihuan is making an official goodwill visit to 
the Kingdom of Norway at the invitation of the Norwegian 
Government.

  [Text] Oslo, 11 May (XINHUA) -- At a meeting this afternoon 
with Norwegian entrepreneurs from industrial and commercial 
circles, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who is on an 
official friendly visit to Norway, briefed Norwegian 
entrepreneurs on China's achievements in reform and opening up 
and expressed the hope of developing reciprocal and cooperative 
relations between China and Norway. 
  He said: China is making efforts to establish a brand-new 
socialist market economic structure. In the progress of reform 
and opening up, China has significantly improved its investment 
environment, gradually amplified its economic laws and 
regulations, and expanded its investment scope. "From now on, 
we must continue to deepen reform, open wider to the outside 
world, and further improve the investment environment in order 
to offer favorable conditions to foreign entrepreneurs who come 
to China to promote economic cooperation." 
  Li Ruihuan said: In recent years, economic and trade 
exchanges and cooperation in other fields between China and 
Norway have developed rapidly. However, in light of the 
supplementary nature and strength of both economies, the 
potential for bilateral cooperation is still great. He added: 
I welcome more Norwegian entrepreneurs to invest in China and 
to establish more foreign- funded enterprises. I hope that 
entrepreneurs from Norwegian economic circles will formulate 
long-term strategies and foster an enterprising spirit to 
explore more fields of cooperation with China. 
  Schel Kultin [name as received], secretary general of the 
Norwegian Foreign Ministry, presided over the meeting. He said: 
Chairman Li Ruihuan's visit has helped Norwegian enterprises 
understand China's economic development, and his visit is 
conducive to promoting the development of reciprocal and 
cooperative relations between Norway and China. He expressed 
his hope that Chairman Li Ruihuan's visit will further promote 
the development of bilateral economic and trade relations based 
on the existing foundation. Entrepreneurs from Norway's 
industrial and commercial circles introduced the strong points 
of their enterprises and the development of cooperation with 
Chinese enterprises. They offered suggestions as well.

  [Text] Copenhagen, 16 May (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
[CCPPCC] National Committee, called on Danish Prime Minister 
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen here this morning. Lauding Sino-Danish 
friendship, the two leaders noted great potential and broad 
prospects for bilateral cooperation. 
  Li Ruihuan spoke first, saying he was delighted to meet 
Prime 
Minister Rasmussen and thanking the Danish Government for warm 
hospitality. He told Rasmussen that China is very happy to see 
the two countries expanding cooperation in various fields and 
enjoying a deepened understanding in recent years as a result of 
expanded exchanges at senior levels, adding that rapid growth in 
bilateral trade and economic cooperation has brought about a big 
increase in trade volume. 
  The Danish prime minister said that he was deeply impressed 
by China's economic development and described Danish-Chinese 
relations as very good, expressing his optimism about future 
cooperation. 
  At Rasmussen's request, Li Ruihuan gave an outline of 
China's 
efforts to promote socialist democratic politics and the role of 
the CPPCC. He said: The CPPCC is an important organizational 
form of the system of multiparty cooperation and political 
consultation led by the CPC. Different from Western 
parliaments, the CPPCC's main function is to conduct political 
consultation and democratic supervision and to take part in the 
administration and discussion of state affairs. It conducts 
consultations on the state's general political principles, 
important matters in the political life, and major issues 
related to economic and social development. Moreover, the CPPCC 
and its members exercise effective democratic supervision over 
the enforcement of the Constitution and other laws and 
regulations, the implementation of key policies, and the 
execution of duties by state organs and functionaries. All 
CPPCC members are empowered with the democratic right to make 
criticism and air dissent. By practicing democracy in such a 
way, the CPPCC enables the people to have full consultation on 
major issues while exercising their democratic rights through 
election and voting. It also enables the people to exercise 
extensive democratic supervision, as well as legal supervision. 
Such a way of practicing democracy can help the CPC bring into 
play its leadership role and the democratic parties take part in 
the administration of state affairs. It is conducive to 
ensuring respect for the majority's common aspiration while 
taking into account the minority's reasonable demand, thereby 
seeking maximum common understanding of the whole people and 
preserving the stability and harmony of the entire society. 
  Li Ruihuan added: Over a long period of time, the CPPCC has 
made important contributions to consolidating and developing 
political stability and unity; to facilitating reform, opening 
up, and modernization construction; and to promoting the 
motherland's reunification and development, as well as 
friendship and cooperation with the peoples of various 
countries. In the future, it will further carry out its 
functions, actively develop exchange and cooperation with the 
peoples of various countries, and make unremitting efforts to 
promote world peace and development.

  [Text] Copenhagen, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Danish Foreign 
Minister Niels Petersen and Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC), today expressed the hope that exchanges and 
friendly relations between their two countries will be further 
increased and strengthened. 
  In his talks with Petersen, Li, who arrived here Friday for 
a 
four-day visit, said Denmark was among the first Western 
countries to recognize the People's Republic of China and since 
the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries in 1950, bilateral cooperation has been developed 
considerably in the political, economic, scientific and cultural 
fields. 
  In recent years, the traditional Sino-Danish friendship has 
been further strengthened thanks to the efforts of both sides, 
he said. 
  There have been more exchanges of high-level visits between 
the two sides while bilateral economic and trade relations have 
been increasing, he added. 
  Li also noted that a number of large and medium-sized Danish 
enterprises have invested in China and built factories there 
while some others are ready to do more business in the country. 
  The Chinese leader told Petersen that in its development of 
national economy, China needs to learn the advanced technology 
and managerial expertise of developed countries including 
Denmark. 
  There are great potentials of and broad prospects for 
Sino-Danish cooperation, said Li. 
  "We are willing to further develop friendship and 
cooperation 
with Denmark on the basis of seeking common grounds and 
reserving differences and of equality and mutual benefit," Li 
declared. 
  Petersen said Denmark and China have traditional friendly 
relationship and bilateral trade in recent years has increased 
considerably. 
  The Danish foreign minister told Li that his country pays 
great attention to the development of relations with China. 
  He also praised China's economic achievements and expressed 
his confidence that Li's visit to Denmark will further promote 
bilateral cooperation. 
  Li is on a five-nation European tour which has already taken 
him to Finland, Sweden and Norway and will take him to Belgium.

  [Text] Brussels, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), arrived here today on a 
five-day official goodwill visit to Belgium. 
  In a written speech delivered at Brussels airport, Li said 
China and Belgium stand on the two ends of the Asian and 
European Continents and are far off geographically, but Belgium 
is not unfamiliar to the Chinese people. 
  He said the Chinese people admire the Belgians for the 
achievements scored in the long-term cause of developing their 
national economy and building their country. 
  Li recalled the cooperative relationship between China and 
Belgium, saying the Sino-Belgian ties have well developed since 
the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1971. 
  There have been many exchanges of high-level visits between 
the two sides and the bilateral trade volume has increased 
dozens of times, said the Chinese leader. 
  He noted that there is a new momentum for the two countries 
to promote their cooperation in all fields thanks to the efforts 
of both sides over the past few years. 
  So long as China and Belgium observe the principle of 
seeking 
common ground while reserving differences, and of mutual respect 
for each other, non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs and mutual benefit, Li said, the mutually beneficial 
relationship of cooperation between the two countries can be 
developed steadily. 
  This will not only serve the interests of the Chinese and 
Belgian people, but also world peace, stability and development, 
added the Chinese leader. 
  Li will hold extensive talks with Belgian leaders on 
bilateral relations and international issues of common concern. 
  He expressed hope that his visit, which came at the 
invitation of the presidents of the Belgian Senate and Chamber 
of Representatives, will further enhance the understanding 
between the two peoples, thus pushing forward the Sino-Belgian 
friendly cooperative relationship in future. 
  Li is on a five-nation European tour which has already taken 
him to Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

  [Text] Bonn, 11 May (XINHUA) -- While meeting with Xie Fei, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and 
secretary of the Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee, German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke about the good progress in 
German-Chinese relations and the great potential for developing 
bilateral relations. 
  Kohl met with and feted Xie Fei and his party today at noon 
at the chancellor's office, where they held talks in a cordial 
and friendly atmosphere. Kohl inquired with great interest 
about developments in China and in Guangdong. Xie Fei replied 
to Kohl's questions one by one. 
  When touching on German-Chinese relations, Kohl said that in 
terms of both Chinese history and tradition and the two 
countries' cultures, it is of extremely important significance 
for Germany to develop its relations with China. Kohl also 
figuratively compared a politician to a "forest worker." Very 
often, the forest worker devotes his energy to tree-planting. 
But, when the trees grow to become a forest, he is no longer 
around. If no one plants trees, then there will never be a 
forest. Kohl said that he was willing to visit China again if 
he is given an opportunity to do so in the future. 
  Xie Fei said that Chancellor Kohl had made a very correct 
decision to develop cooperative relations with China. For 
Guangdong, developing relations with Germany will not only help 
develop Guangdong but also bring reasonable rewards for German 
businesses. The development of Sino-German economic relations 
may enhance friendship between the two countries. Economic 
relations will play an enduring role in enhancing the friendship 
between the two countries. 
  Xie Fei arrived in Bonn on 10 May to begin an eight-day 
visit 
to Germany at the invitation of Chancellor Kohl. The major 
purpose of his visit is to inspect Germany's new and high 
technology and to brief Germany on the major projects in 
Guangdong. Xie Fei also met in Bonn with representatives of 
German economic circles.

for newspapers and broadcasting stations in Beijing City] 
  [Text] Paris, 15 May (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 15 
May, Beijing City Mayor Li Qiyan flew out of Paris for Germany 
after concluding a four-day goodwill visit to Paris. 
  During his stay in Paris, Li Qiyan made wide-ranging 
contacts 
with French industrial and commercial circles and briefed them 
on the great situation in China's reform and opening up to the 
outside world, particularly Beijing City's achievements in 
introducing foreign capital and developing economy over the past 
15 years. 
  Li Qiyan said: More than 8,000 foreign-funded enterprises 
have been set up in Beijing City since 1978, bringing in $11.3 
billion in direct investment and $2.5 billion worth of 
technology to promote local economic development. He expressed 
the hope that French entrepreneurs would enthusiastically invest 
in Beijing to make new contributions to the development of 
economic cooperation between China and France. 
  Li Qiyan also visited projects under the Paris Municipal 
Government. This morning he made a quick trip to France's 
largest wholesale market for agricultural and sideline products 
at the southern suburbs of Paris to find out about Paris 
residents' food supply. In addition, he attended a ceremony for 
signing joint venture agreements between the Beijing Heavy 
Electrical Machinery Plant, the Beijing Winery, the China 
Packaging Industry Development Corporation, the Beijing Economic 
and Technological Development Zone, and the Beijing 
Huairou-Huaibei Cement Plant, and their French counterparts. 
According to the agreements, the two sides will cooperate in 
producing steam turbine, alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks, 
pop-top can, cement, and milk products in Beijing. 
  Li Qiyan arrived in Paris on the evening of 11 May at the 
invitation of Paris District Assembly President (Giraud). 
During his visit, Li Qiyan met with French Equipment, 
Transport, and Tourism Minister Bernard Bosson to exchange views 
on further developing Sino-French and Beijing-Paris friendly 
relations and cooperation.

  [Excerpt] Hefei, 25 April (XINHUA) -- Since its opening to 
scientists at home and abroad in April 1993, the State 
Synchotron Radiation Laboratory of the Chinese University of 
Science and Technology has provided internationally advanced 
scientific research and experiment conditions to many 
researchers from scientific research institutes in China. So 
far, the laboratory has carried out more than 120 research 
projects for 45 research institutes and universities across the 
country. It has achieved gratifying results in the fields of 
physics, chemistry, biological science, and material science. 
  Synchotron radiation is a kind of extremely powerful 
electromagnetic radiation produced by high-energy electrons that 
move tangentially in a loop-type accelerator at near 
light-speed. Equipped with such excellent characteristics as 
great intensity, high luminance, continuous frequency spectrum, 
good polarization, pulse-time structure, and pure vacuum 
environment, synchotron radiation has been widely applied in 
basic subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology, medical 
science, surface science, and measurement science as well as in 
technical fields such as microprocessing and super integrated 
circuits. Being an advanced scientific and research means, it 
plays a very active role in the frontier scientific and 
technological field. 
  After over a year of operation and trial runs, this 
synchotron radiation installation, the only one in China, 
succeeded for the first time in operating with high luminance. 
The synchotron radiation source can produce light around the 
clock, with over 6,000 operation hours a year. It can provide 
more than 3,600 hours of experimental time. Five experimental 
stations of photochemistry, photoelectron, soft X-ray micrology, 
X-ray photoetching, and chronospectroscopy have been put into 
operation. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Trade Minister Optimistic on 1994 Exports"] </F>
  [Text] Despite higher export costs, the nation's foreign 
trade posted a sound performance in the first quarter. 
  "Exports did not slide as in the corresponding period last 
year, and imports did not spin out of control," said Wu Yi, 
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec) . 
  Exports grew by 18.7 per cent over the first quarter last 
year and imports grew by 18.2 per cent, according to Customs 
figures. 
  Wu stressed that China plans to achieve a virtual balance 
between its imports and exports by the end of this year, with 
total foreign trade standing at around $200 billion. 
  China suffered a deficit of $12.2 billion last year, partly 
because of a booming domestic market that drew resources away 
from exports. 
  Wu said the unification of the two-tier foreign exchange 
rate 
system presents China with an unprecedented opportunity to 
develop exports. 
  However, higher export costs threaten to offset almost all 
the benefits brought by the foreign exchange reform. 
  Exports prices are being driven up by rising costs, 
especially of raw materials, as foreign countries lower their 
purchasing prices for imports in the wake of the renminbi's 
devaluation. The standardized exchange rate now is 8.7 yuan per 
dollar, compared with 5.7 yuan before. 
  The prices of raw materials have risen in part because of 
the 
unexpected growth in investment in fixed assets. This has made 
it difficult for the central bank, the People's Bank of China, 
to keep a cap on capital spending. 
  Analysts said that the recent move by the State Council to 
cancel some of the country's futures trading markets would also 
help slow the price spiral. 
  In particular, the steel futures trading market was stopped 
to prevent the price of steel, the most sought-after product in 
the investment expansion, from soaring. 
  Economists maintain that unchecked speculation by futures 
traders has unjustifiably forced up the country's overall price 
level. 
  The new Import and Export Bank will also benefit Chinese 
exporters of value-added machinery and electronics. 
  "It seems that China's exports are facing a bundle of 
lurking 
problems, but they are progressing steadily," said a senior 
government economist. 
  Another major threat to exports is unchecked competition 
among domestic exporters, who tend to slash their prices to win 
foreign market share but at the expense of national interests. 
  Wu Yi said China is intensifying its efforts to bring order 
to exports.

  [Text] To promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of China's foreign trade, the State Council has 
decided to set up the Import and Export Bank of China. A 
station correspondent interviewed Tong Zhiguang, board chairman 
of the Import and Export Bank of China. [Video shows Tong 
Zhiguang, in a dark Western business suit, seated at a desk in 
his office; a male reporter is seen sitting across the desk and 
holding out a microphone. As Tong speaks, the camera zooms in 
to show medium closeup shots of him.] 
  [Liu Shaobo] "Chairman Tong, why did we establish the Import 
and Export Bank of China?" 
  [Tong] "The State Council's decision to set up the China 
Export and Import Bank is geared to the demands of our country's 
current implementation of a socialist market economy. For many 
years, our country has achieved tremendous results in exports 
but our main exports have been agricultural, sideline, 
indigenous, and specialty products. We now face the task of 
upgrading and renewing our export products by exporting more 
technology-intensive products. A review of the status of our 
country's industries shows that our machinery and electronics 
products and turnkey equipment are highly competitive in this 
respect. The bank's establishment will create excellent 
conditions for the export of such products. The bank will 
extend credit on the export of such goods, so as to create a 
strong banking support system for upgrading and improving their 
quality." 
  Chairman Tong Zhiguang told the reporter: The Import and 
Export Bank of China's capital funds are allocated from the 
state coffers. The bank is managed on the basis of 
self-sufficiency and break-even concepts, and along the lines of 
enterprise administration; however, it is not an institution 
that provides free allocations. Operationally, it is directed 
and supervised by the Finance Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, and the People's Bank of China.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Yuan Pu (5913 2528) and reporter Li Anding </F>
(2621 1344 1353)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- During a recent 
interview, Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State 
Economic and Trade Commission, said that replacing state 
enterprises' operating mechanisms and turning them into modern 
businesses is an assignment which the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee specifically put forth. He said: 
Enterprises' immediate project of deepening reform will 
underscore the "replacement of mechanisms." His commission and 
other relevant departments have already drawn up a plan for this 
purpose. To deepen the reform, efforts will be made to 
"expedite reform in its entirety, achieve breakthroughs at key 
points, and carry out supporting projects comprehensively" to 
make sure that enterprise reforms will deepen. 
  Wang Zhongyu said: While implementing this plan, we must 
proceed from a new angle and establish new concepts so that 
enterprise reform can reach a higher level. Under this plan, 
the rights and benefits that the state enjoys as an investor and 
the limited liabilities it undertakes must be commensurate with 
its investments. This plan also specifically provides that state 
enterprises must have a stronger influence and play a dominant 
role through controlling and purchasing stocks and by using 
limited state capital to dominate more capital. The plan also 
specifically states that perennially unprofitable enterprises 
and insolvent enterprises must be allowed to go bankrupt 
according to the law, and that assets should flow rationally so 
that they can have the maximum effect and help attain the 
anticipated goals for reform. 
  Wang Zhongyu said: "Expediting reform in its entirety" means 
that the two regulations -- the "Regulations Governing the 
Change of Operating Mechanisms in State-Owned Industrial 
Enterprises" and the "Regulations Governing the Supervision and 
Control of State-Owned Property" -- must be implemented along 
with the establishment of a modern enterprise system. In other 
words, enterprises must enjoy all the privileges and fulfill all 
their obligations prescribed in the regulations, and state-owned 
property must be controlled more effectively so that a modern 
enterprise system can be reliably established on the basis of 
reforming the labor, personnel, and wage systems and 
implementing the "Accountancy Norm" and "General Principles for 
Financial Affairs" as well as the two sets of aforementioned 
regulations. 
  "Achieving breakthroughs at key points" means that efforts 
must be made to expedite the development of major enterprises 
and regions. Over a two-year period, 10,000 large and medium 
state- owned enterprises will be designated to implement the 
"Enterprise Law," the regulations on changing operating 
mechanisms, the accountancy norm, and the guiding principles for 
financial affairs; to finish reappraising their stocks and 
assets; and to basically complete changing their operating 
mechanisms. While implementing the regulations for supervising 
state-owned property, the state will, by groups and by stages, 
set up supervisory boards at 1,000 mainstay enterprises to 
exercise supervision over the state-owned property of these 
enterprises whose operations are closely associated with the 
national economy and people's livelihood. Meanwhile, under the 
State Council's consolidated leadership and planning, 100 large 
and medium businesses will be selected to experiment with modern 
operations in order to explore ways to operate these businesses 
like corporations. At the same time, a dozen or so cities will 
be designated to carry out supporting reforms with the objective 
of optimizing capital structures and increasing the strength of 
enterprises. The economic and trade commission and eight other 
departments have already drawn up plans for carrying out pilot 
projects in about 10 cities concerning replenishing enterprises, 
separating their responsibilities, and lightening their burdens 
as well as letting insolvent enterprises go bankrupt. 
  As for "carrying out supporting projects comprehensively," 
cities will be asked to take advantage of their abilities to 
launch comprehensive reforms and deal with key problems that 
have been plaguing large and medium enterprises for a long time. 
Meanwhile, mechanisms for strengthening coordination between 
general and specialized departments will be established so that 
problems can be dealt with comprehensively. 
  Wang Zhongyu said: Our plan has gone into effect with a 
positive response and support from local governments and 
enterprises. Owing to problems confronting enterprises, the 
measures prescribed in the plans are quite strong. For example, 
to carry out the "Bankruptcy Law" and to speed up enterprises' 
organizational restructuring, it has been prescribed that 
markets' trading property rights will be established in cities 
so that property use can be optimized. With respect to 
separating enterprises' social functions, cities that have been 
designated to carry out the pilot project will establish some 
labor service markets so that they can gradually undertake 
various social functions, such as placing surplus workers 
through various channels. Different methods will also be 
adopted to help enterprises reduce their unwarranted debts 
according to different circumstances. 
  Wang Zhongyu indicated that he expected that the plan will 
encounter many problems but that his commission is determined to 
follow through with the plan, seize the opportunity to expedite 
enterprise reform, act in a practical manner in dealing with the 
problems that the old system has caused enterprises, and create 
the conditions that can enable large and medium state-owned 
enterprises to move into the market without burdens.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (CNS)--Deputy director of the State 
Administration of Foreign Exchange Control, Mr Song Haipeng, 
speaking at an international seminar on finance recently held in 
Shenzhen, revealed that the foreign exchange market in China 
developed very rapidly in past years. 
  According to the deputy director, there are 2,292 financial 
institutions engaging in foreign exchange businesses at present 
across the country, of which 2,042 are domestically funded, 90 
are foreign funded or Sino-foreign joint ventures. The total 
foreign exchange assets are put at U.S.$230 billion. 
  The foreign exchange market in the country mainly includes 
two parts. One is the foreign exchange swap market with over 
100 foreign exchange centres of various kinds offering services 
to enterprises and individuals for foreign exchange trading. 
The transaction value of foreign exchange in recent years was 
about U.S.$25 billion. Another part is the securities market 
for capital raising. Chinese enterprises have, since 1991, 
issued "B" shares for overseas investors. At present, some 30 
kinds of "B" shares have been listed in the Shenzhen and 
Shanghai Stock Exchanges with over U.S.$1 billion of foreign 
exchange capital raised. 
  Mr Song said that several medium and large state-owned 
enterprises were listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last 
year and, at the same time, China also raised foreign capital by 
issuing bonds in foreign countries including Tokyo, London, 
Frankfurt, Singapore, Luxembourg, and the United States. In 
addition, China's foreign exchange capital market and futures 
market are improving. 
  Mr Song was convinced that with the sustained and rapid 
economic growth and the further opening to the outside world, 
the unified foreign exchange trading market for inter-bank 
businesses opened last April, replacing the foreign exchange 
swap markets. [sentence as received] Such a unified market 
will greatly speed up the circulation of foreign exchange 
capital and increase the market supply and demand, which will 
promote the development of the foreign exchange market across 
the country.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (CNS)--Vice Minister of 
Construction, Mr Tan Qinglian recently expressed that in the 
next seven years (1994-2000), the demand of construction 
industry was expected to increase by 12 percent on average each 
year based on the price in 1990. The total output value in this 
period will be RMB [renminbi] 4,400 billion, RMB 620 billion for 
each year. 
  According to Mr Tan, the demand in this industry in the next 
seven years will mainly come from the following: 
  First, task of key construction will be very hard. A batch 
of state key projects covering energy, transport, raw materials, 
and water conservancy must be constructed in a centralized, 
fine- quality, and efficient way. 
  Second, demand in real estate will increase greatly. In the 
1990's, the country will at least need 1.65 billion square 
metres of residential space in urban areas and 6.5 billion 
square metres of such space in rural areas to be constructed. 
At present there are billions of square metres of housing area 
in rural and urban areas need to be renovated. In addition, the 
demand in real estate for industry, tourism and commercial 
services will also be very big. Various kinds of development 
zones at state and provincial levels will become new keen areas 
for investment, more and more foreign businessmen will engage in 
this sector. 
  Third, the country will see an increase of about 150 new 
cities and 3,000 new towns by the year 2,000. Urban 
construction and old cities' renovation will speed up. 
Environment for investment and conditions for production and 
people's living will be further improved. 
  Rural areas will become a construction market with huge 
potential. Ratio of investment in rural areas to social fixed 
assets investment was 27.9 percent in 1990 and such ratio will 
increase greatly in years to come.

<F P=106> [By Liang Chao: "Minister Vows Aid to Poor Will Rise"] </F>
  [Text] Social relief payments and provisions of food and 
clothing to the poor will be gradually increased in response to 
the rising prices in various areas, pledged Doje Cering, 
Minister of Civil Affairs. 
  "This will be one of the ministry's major objectives in 
civil 
affairs work for the following five years," he said addressing 
the 10th National Conference on Civil Affairs, which opened in 
Beijing on Thursday. 
  In China, about 200 million people receive government 
assistance. 
  The recipients comprise three major groups: families of 
martyrs and servicemen, disabled and demobilized servicemen, 
retired army officers, and veterans of the Red Army; childless 
elders, the disabled, orphans and poverty-stricken families; and 
victims of natural disasters. 
  The rural and urban poor lived on just 400 yuan ($46) last 
year, while the average annual per capita in come of rural 
residents and city dwellers was 921 yuan ($105) and 1,400 yuan 
($161) respectively. 
  "The living conditions of the poor may be worsening for a 
time due to inflation, which will also make the government's 
social relief more difficult, the minister said. 
  Meanwhile, the government anticipates problems in finding 
jobs for the tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers and large 
numbers of the disabled in the years ahead, due to the labour 
reforms and the intensified market competition among enterprises. 
  One major way to ease the funding shortage and help the 
poor, 
the minister said, is to mobilize various forces to accelerate 
the development of public welfare projects. 
  There are 43,681 public welfare institutions caring for some 
724,000 individuals in China's urban and rural areas, but only 
about 2,000 of them are run by the civil affairs departments; 
the rest are financed by social organizations or individuals.

  [Text] Beijing, 14 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Prices are 
currently one of the greatest concerns of the Chinese people. 
To further tighten price management, concerned departments are 
planning to continue increasing the force of regulation and 
control. Some relevant measures are expected to be unveiled 
around June and July. 
  These measures are understood to include: First, strict 
controls over the scale of fixed-asset investment, firmly 
cutting and stopping a number of construction projects, no more 
approval this year for large and medium-sized infrastructure 
projects not listed in the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," and strict 
controls over high-class office buildings, villas, and upmarket 
entertainment facilities. 
  Second, strict control over the excessive growth of 
consumption funds. There are plans to slow down the growth rate 
of consumption funds by reducing corporate consumption power 
with methods such as strengthening the finances of enterprises 
and nonprofit-making institutions and taxation and controlling 
and cutting back administrative expenditure, while turning the 
purchasing power and consumption of urban and rural residents 
into savings and mid and long-term investment. 
  Third, make great efforts to pursue agriculture and "food 
basket" projects, increase the cultivated area for major 
agricultural products, such as grains and cotton, and ensure 
that materials and funds supporting agriculture reach their 
destination. 
  Fourth, make further efforts at building and perfecting 
means 
to regulate and control prices and markets, including reserve 
systems for several key commodities and a risk fund system in 
order to increase the state's regulatory and control powers. 
  Fifth, arrange well this year's production and supply of key 
commodities. To stabilize grain and oil prices, the state will, 
if necessary, release quantities of reserve grain and oil. 
  Furthermore, the State Planning Commission is drafting rules 
and regulations against profiteering.

Multitude of Measures Is Needed To Curb Inflation"] 
  [Text] The vast number of people in Jiangsu are pleased 
that the margin of commodity price hikes in the province has 
dropped since March. However, having experienced the hardship 
of steep hikes in grain and vegetable prices last year, many 
people still harbor a lingering fear. They are particularly 
concerned about grain and vegetable prices, and have called on 
the government to hold down the prices of the "grain bag" and 
"vegetable basket" at all costs! 
  Unquestionably, if the prices of goods and clothing increase 
a little, we can buy less or refuse to buy them. However, food 
is a necessity which we must purchase daily. When grain and 
vegetable prices increase excessively, it will of course have a 
strong impact, and immediately affect the people and aggravate 
the hardships of low-income families. However, we have taken 
the task too lightly if we believe we can control commodity 
prices as well as grain and vegetable prices by applying the 
sole "commodity price control" measure. 
  For example, grains are primary products and raw materials 
for the food processing industry. However, for farmers, grains 
are terminal products as well. Grain prices are affected by 
demand, moreover, they are factors that finally determine 
capital investment in agriculture. When capital increases 
following the hike in prices of chemical fertilizers, farm 
chemicals, and machinery, controlling only grain prices and not 
the prices of capital goods is obviously unfair because it will 
harm peasants' benefits. No wonder that as the busy farming 
season approaches, farmers are making this urgent call: "Like 
holding down grain prices last year, the country must adopt 
strong measures to control price hikes for capital goods." 
However, chemical fertilizers and farm chemicals are also 
terminal products of capital goods manufacturing enterprises. 
When prices of capital goods are low, manufacturing enterprises 
naturally ask for preferential prices for the supply of oil, 
water, power, and coal. Subsequently, a chain reaction that also 
affects other prices will be created. 
  It is evident that prices of grains and other commodities 
are 
linked to and affect each other. As a fundamental commodity, 
the fluctuations of grain prices will affect other prices. 
However, when other prices fluctuate, grain prices cannot help 
but fluctuate. For example, exceeding our financial capability 
by expanding and embarking on too many projects will not help to 
control grain prices. On the contrary, the action will 
precisely become the driving force for hiking grain and 
commodity prices. According to a report by RENMIN RIBAO, the 
total fixed asset investment in 1993 was 1182.9 billion yuan, a 
sharp rise of 50 percent over that of the previous year. A 
piece of stone will create a thousand layers of waves. The 
first wave created was a steep hike of 38.2 percent in capital 
goods prices; the second wave spurred a 24-percent increase in 
industrial goods prices; and the third wave caused a 13-percent 
increase in consumer goods retail prices. Further, subsequent 
effects became factors for continued inflation, making the trend 
of this year's commodity prices not too optimistic. As they are 
a part of the commodity price chain, how could grain and 
vegetable prices not be affected? 
  Since price hikes are due to many factors, a multitude of 
measures should be taken to stabilize commodity prices. The 
inflation problem should be tackled by looking into both its 
root cause and symptoms, and a multitude of -- instead of 
singular -- measures should be adopted. If we do not wish to 
see outlandish increases in the prices of the "grain bag" and 
"vegetable basket," we should urgently call for a halt to 
embarking on an excessive number of projects, excessive 
spending, neglecting the role of agriculture as the foundation 
of the national economy, and rampant spread of shocking 
profiteering in the market. First, the size of capital 
construction planned for this year should generally be the same 
as last year. It is necessary to strictly control galloping 
expansion, and prevent a tight supply-demand situation that will 
become a motive force causing price hikes. Second, we should 
not use bank overdrafts to cover financial deficits, but should 
raise funds by issuing government bonds to prevent money 
depreciation due to deficits. Third, we should attach great 
importance to agriculture and the "vegetable basket" project. 
We should increase investment in the project by adopting 
appropriate comprehensive measures that will raise grain 
purchase prices. We should strive to arouse peasants' 
enthusiasm, stabilize grain and vegetable production, increase 
supply, and maintain the supply-demand balance. Fourth, we 
should strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, and 
monitor the prices of 20 essential commodities that concern the 
people's livelihood, including the "grain bag," "vegetable 
basket," and "stove." We should standardize pricing to bring 
the margin of price hikes within the limits consumers can 
afford. We should undertake various measures to curb the 
excessive growth in demand, regulate the supply-demand 
situation, and hold down commodity prices. 
  To obtain desired results in implementing a multitude of 
measures for curbing inflation and stabilizing prices, it is 
necessary for all sides in society to enhance the concept of 
giving due consideration to the overall situation, 
conscientiously submit to macroeconomic regulation and control, 
gradually implement every measure, and expend vigorous efforts 
to solve each practical problems. We can then realistically 
curb the rampant growth of various factors that cause inflation, 
and succeed in ensuring basically stable prices for the "grain 
bag" and "vegetable basket" without extra efforts.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- China's economy is 
operating in the direction required by macro-economic controls, 
the State Planning Commission announced today. 
  Wei Liqun, a spokesman for the commission, said at a news 
conference that the gross domestic product (GDP) -- the value of 
goods and services produced nationwide -- shot up 12.7 percent 
during the first quarter of 1994, compared with the same quarter 
a year ago. 
  "Agricultural production is rising steadily," he said. 
  Localities have encouraged farmers to grow grain crops and 
cotton on acreages as planned by the government, have increased 
funding in support of the farming sector and have stepped up the 
construction of vegetable and non-staple food production centers 
in major cities, he said. 
  "Meanwhile, industrial production has scored a sustained and 
fast growth," he said. 
  The increased value of China's industrial production rose 
16.4 percent in the first four months of 1994, compared with the 
same period last year. 
  More importantly, industrial production of state-owned 
factories has begun to pick up, he said. For example, the 
production value of such factories rose five percent in April 
over the same month in 1993, up nearly three percentage points 
from the first quarter of this year. 
  According to Wei, China's financial situation has been 
stable 
since the beginning of the year. 
  For instance, all newly-printed money put into circulation 
between New Year's Day and the Spring Festival in mid-February 
had been withdrawn from circulation by March 28. 
  Savings deposits in urban and rural areas soared by 130 
billion yuan during the January-April period than the same 
period a year ago, Wei said. 
  Furthermore, 50 percent of the quota for the issue of this 
year's treasury bonds had been met by May 10, he added. 
  The excessive increase in fixed asset investments has been 
curtailed, he said, noting that such investments by state-owned 
companies and institutions climbed 38.4 percent in the first 
four months of 1994, 30.5 percentage points lower than in the 
same period a year ago. 
  "Basically, the domestic market is stable," Wei said. 
  For example, the country's retail sales grew 4.2 percent in 
real terms during the January-April period. At least 90 percent 
of commodities are either in a near balance between supply and 
demand or with a surplus of supplies. 
  The spokesman said that China's exports soared 22 percent in 
the first four months of 1994 to 28.04 billion U.S. dollars, 
while its imports shot up 20.3 percent to 29.79 billion dollars. 
  "The tendency towards an over-rapid increase in prices has 
been brought under initial control," he told the news conference. 
  The increase in the retail price index in March fell to 0.9 
percent from three percent in both January and February, he 
added. 
  He forecast that in the first half of this year, the GDP is 
expected to rise by around 12 percent, industrial output value 
by about 18 percent, fixed asset investments by state-owned 
companies and institutions by 30 percent and retail sales by 22 
percent. 
  The spokesman also anticipated a further fall in the 
increase 
in prices during the second quarter of the year. 
  He noted that some deep-rooted and structural problems in 
China's economy are yet to be solved and warned against relaxing 
efforts to control inflation.

  [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Propaganda 
Department of the CPC Central Committee and Ministry of Justice 
recently issued a circular, calling on propaganda departments of 
party committees and judicial administrative organs at all 
levels to properly organize the propaganda of and education in 
legal knowledge about a socialist market economy, to better 
serve the establishment and improvement of a socialist market 
economic system. 
  The circular noted: The "Decision on the Establishment of a 
Socialist Market Economic System" adopted by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee clearly mapped out a 
blueprint for China to establish a socialist market economic 
system. It indicates that China combines efforts to promote the 
economy as a whole with those to achieve breakthroughs at focal 
points, thereby entering a new phase in carrying out the reform 
of its economic system. Progress sets a demand on us to 
accelerate legislation of economic laws and, furthermore, to 
learn how to use legal means to manage the economy as well as 
other fields of endeavor. China has successively adopted and 
amended a number of laws and regulations on the market economy 
in recent years. A legal framework standardizing the socialist 
market economy will take its initial shape in the next few 
years, according to the objectives proposed by the current 
National People's Congress for its work. It has become an 
important and urgent mission to further successfully conduct 
propaganda of and education in legal knowledge about the market 
economy; and to enhance the vast numbers of cadres' and masses' 
awareness of the market economy's legal system under the new 
situation of accelerating the legislation of the laws on a 
socialist market economy in China. 
  The circular called on propaganda departments of party 
committees and judicial administrative organs at all levels to 
have an adequate understanding of the importance of successfully 
conducting propaganda of and education in legal knowledge about 
the socialist market economy; to stress the need to do a good 
job of publicizing and studying laws and regulations closely 
related to the market economy in the last two years of the 
"second five-year" plan for spreading legal knowledge; to 
especially publicize in depth laws and regulations that have a 
bearing on the immediate interests of the masses of people; and 
to focus on the substance of laws and regulations on the market 
economy during study of the laws on specialized trades and 
professions.

  [Text] Beijing, May 14 (CNS) -- The State Planning 
Commission of China recently called planning departments and 
those concerned for the strengthening administration of direct 
foreign-funded items.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Gao Shangquan, member of the </F>
Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, by Henry Cheung; 
place and date not given: "Breaking the Taboos of the Jobs 
Market"] 
  [Text] Last December, when Chinese leaders raised the 
banner of a "socialist labour market" in their grand reform plan 
through 2000, few outside observers seemed quite sure what it 
really meant. "It is an important breakthrough in the taboos of 
the past," said Gao Shangquan, China's all-time champion of the 
concept of a labour market, in a recent interview with Window. 
  Gao was deputy minister of the State Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy from 1982 to 1990 and has been a key 
member of the team which is designing China's market economy. 
He is also China's chief economist on the Preliminary Working 
Committee (PWC) for the future Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. 
  The major breakthrough or, as the official press called it, 
the most "earth-shaking" reform, has been to let the formerly 
permanently employed workers in state-owned enterprises flow 
into the marketplace--to trade their services and skills for 
their "rice bowl" (instead of earning it by just being in 
possession of an urban resident's card). 
  Workers in the state sector did get the message, even though 
few of them would have cared to read the long-winded 50-point 
official document. The document was released shortly after a 
Beijing company manager returned from a business trip to the 
prosperous Pearl River Delta where he had sold his firm's 
assembly lines to a buyer in the south. 
  This meant his company would cease to exist and its staff 
would join a former rival firm, under an arrangement with the 
municipal authorities, even if only temporarily. But the 
manager himself had made up his mind already; he had chosen 
early retirement at the age of 50. Women workers in his factory 
were entitled to early retirement at 45. "Next year I will go 
down south on my own business trip," the electrical 
technician-turned manager said. "I'll set up a small workshop 
with a few friends of mine." 
  For years, the very concept of labour market was taboo in 
China's "workers' paradise" economy. In the earlier reform 
years, all kinds of euphemisms such as "service market" were 
used for labour market which still remained an ideologically 
unacceptable concept. 
  Things began to change last November when Gao urged in the 
official press that it was time to call a spade a spade. This 
was just several weeks before the concept of a labour market was 
written into the official policy paper. Gao said it would be 
unimaginable for a market economy not to have a labour market. 
It would be "weird" economics if there was a market economy but 
the door remained shut for people to prove what they could do 
best by changing jobs. 
  Protection: [previous word published in boldface] But a 
labour market should trade only labour, not the personal 
freedoms of workers. And that was exactly the role to be played 
by the government, he suggested, not by closing down the labour 
market but by protecting workers' rights. 
  If workers lost their freedoms, the labour market would be 
inefficient, he warned. What the government should do during 
China's economic transition was to concentrate on building up 
its market facilities and maintaining their orderly function, 
instead of continuing to assign goods and jobs arbitrarily. 
  This would remove one major ideological distortion of the 
economy. Observers of China's state-owned enterprises have long 
claimed their managers are either saddled with too many 
responsibilities (running factory kindergartens, for instance) 
to concentrate on business or, because it takes so much hassle 
for them to get rid of even one undisciplined worker, a 
prerequisite for effective management, they seem to feel 
entitled not to be responsible at all. Now, however, the latest 
reform will provide enterprises with a competitive supply of 
labour, enabling them to find whatever skills they need and 
encourage workers' devotion to their work and sense of 
discipline. 
  At the same time, as Gao noted, there has been a de facto 
labour market in China since at least the mid-1980s. Even 
outside farming, the state sector provides just 43 per cent of 
job opportunities; the market's "the invisible hand has already 
arranged jobs for more than half of China's off-farm labour. 
Gao also pointed out that the market provided 60 per cent of 
the work force for the transportation and telecommunication 
industries, 67 per cent for hotels and restaurants and 77 per 
cent for the building industry. 
  He believes that recognising this reality would help the 
government make a more serious effort in looking for solutions 
to problems, such as the shortage of jobs and the potentially 
large number of lay-offs from state-owned enterprises. "The 
most pressing problem right now is our state sector's welfare 
reform." he said. 
  China's industrial welfare system is still to a large extent 
factory-based, and pensioners are paid by their former 
employers, for instance. A society-wide safety net is still an 
experiment purely at the government's initiative. 
  The terms that the Beijing manager mentioned above received 
after his factory's merger are perhaps of the best kind. In an 
early retirement scheme, a worker (or a manager) is paid about 
70 per cent of his former monthly income, along with most 
medical bills. But if he possesses certain skills, he can set 
up his own shop or work as an independent contractor. 
  This is part of the welfare reform experiment in which the 
merger, or sometimes the government, takes care of the welfare 
of laid-off workers. "There are still a lot of details to be 
worked out in the state sector's welfare reform," Gao explained. 
"This year, according to last December's reform plan, is meant 
to be a year of reform in China. But how much reform we can 
actually make will depend on the economy's health in the middle 
of the year." This period could be an extremely difficult time 
for workers in state-owned enterprises. 
  Gao was born in 1929 and graduated from St John's University 
in 1952 as an economics major. Apart from his appointment on 
the PWC, he also holds a number of other important positions 
including vice- chairman of the Chinese Society for 
Restructuring the Economy and honorary professorships in some of 
China's best universities.

  [Text] China's State Statistics Bureau will establish 
overseas joint ventures to meet the need of foreign investors 
for information about the country. Xiang Zhongde, chairman of 
the China Statistics Information Consultancy Service Centre 
(CSICSC), said the bureau planned to launch the joint ventures 
in the United States, Britain and Hong Kong. He added that the 
CSICSC was already involved in discussions with potential 
partners. 
  Mr Xiang said the joint ventures would improve the bureau's 
ability to provide information on China to foreign investors 
who, he added, would no longer have to make the long journey to 
get such information first hand. He said he expected the joint 
ventures to be operative within a year. 
  The CSICSC was formed in late 1992 as the bureau's Hong Kong 
vehicle, underscoring China's efforts in facilitating a flow of 
information among the foreign investors who have joined the 
headlong rush to invest in the mainland. The bureau has similar 
offices in 30 mainland cities. Mr Xiang said Beijing was losing 
control over the dissemination of information as the economy of 
the country rapidly developed and opened. 
  He said more than 80 percent of official statistics and 
information was now freely available to the public. As an 
example, he said information was now available on foreign 
exchange rates and gold reserves. Such information was 
previously not disclosed. "Gradually, China will provide the 
general public with more statistics and figures complied by the 
country," Mr Xiang said. He said the bureau also planned to set 
up a database for professional use which would be available to 
both government departments and the public. 
  Mr Xiang said that in addition to regular large-scale 
population censuses and surveys of the industrial and commercial 
sectors and tertiary industry, the bureau also conducted sample 
surveys on small enterprises to cater for the changing economic 
environment. He said there had been a change in companies' 
operating mechanisms after sweeping reforms in enterprise. 
This, he said, had led to a proliferation of joint ventures, 
collectively-owned enterprises and private concerns. 
  Mr Xiang said the CSICSC would conduct research on specific 
industries in line with customers' requests. To improve 
dissemination of information on China, the bureau will also 
launch a bilingual annual statistics digest in the second half 
of this year. This will replace the existing series with Chinese 
and English versions.

  [Text] China's State Statistical Bureau (SSB) was hit by 
the Friday 13th computer virus on Friday, with the result its 
entire national accounts network was shut down. Key economic 
figures due to be released this week, including the sensitive 
urban inflation figure for April, will be delayed for up to a 
week as a result, according to SSB sources. 
  The bureau's anti-virus team worked through the weekend 
trying to repair the damage, hoping to reboot the bureau's 
American-made Compaq computers by today. But problems were 
encountered and the system was still down last night. 
  Computer viruses are malicious instructions inserted in 
computer programs which cause aberrant behaviour and sometimes 
permanent loss of data. "In the past they always could get rid 
of the virus in a few days. But this one is much more 
complicated," an SSB source said. 
  Because China has not yet established a national statistics 
computer network, the shut-down was not expected to affect the 
normal reporting of provincial figures to the bureau. However, 
data processing has been delayed in Beijing. The SSB has 
suffered regular attacks from computer viruses in the past year, 
according to the source. Most of them appear on Friday, which 
has come to be known within the bureau as "Black Friday". 
  The Ministry of Public Security said last month that about 
70 
to 80 per cent of the nation's computers were infected by 
viruses. A computer virus destroyed parts of the second volume 
of Deng Xiaoping's biography, currently being written by his 
daughter, Deng Rong, it was reported last week. The ministry 
said some viruses had infected "scientific research and higher 
learning institutes", but made no mention of government 
departments. But the official said there were "hundreds" of 
viruses affecting central government computer systems. 
  According to Compaq Computer's main account manager in 
Beijing, Raymond Yam, the SSB and other government users in the 
capital -- which include the State Taxation Administration, the 
Ministry of Finance and the Great Hall of the People -- normally 
deal with the viruses themselves. "The Chinese users are very 
experienced in handling viruses, even more than ourselves," he 
said. 
  Yam said viruses have spread in China recently because of 
widespread use of pirated software, which can quickly infect an 
entire network once used on a single computer. Copying data 
using diskettes can also introduce a virus, he added. 
  Compaq, which sold 80,000 personal computers in China last 
year, claims to hold about a quarter of the state enterprise and 
government department computer market in the country. China has 
a total of about half a million computer systems. The State 
Council issued new regulations in March to control computer 
systems and combat viruses, including an approval system for 
companies making anti-virus products. 
  Two Beijing companies-China Huaneng Group and Beijing Rising 
Computer Company -- were among the first to receive Public 
Security Bureau approval and are believed to have captured a 
large share of the government market in the capital. "There are 
many small companies now in Beijing specialising in helping 
government departments fight viruses," Yam said. "It has become 
a booming business."

  [Text] Beijing, 20 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The State 
Administration of Import and Import Commodities Inspection and 
the Ministry of Finance jointly released the other day the 
"Procedures for the Assessment and Management of 
Foreign-Invested Assets," which take effect on 1 May. 
  It is understood that there are over 170,000 
foreign-invested 
enterprises in China, with about $60 billion in foreign funds 
actually absorbed. In recent years, the proportion of foreign 
businessmen investing in kind has been rising continuously. 
Taking advantage of the weak points where some Chinese 
enterprises do not know the international market prices and lack 
experience, some foreign businessmen have sought illegitimate 
rights and interests. Their principal methods are as follows: 
1) Quoting higher prices for cheap equipment invested; 2) 
practicing fraud by substituting old and inferior equipment for 
the new and good. Furthermore, there are also the phenomenon of 
foreign businessmen quoting low prices for their assets. These 
problems have to a certain extent affected the sound and smooth 
development of foreign-invested enterprises. Therefore, making a 
fair and accurate assessment of the value of foreign-invested 
assets has become an important measure for protecting the 
legitimate rights and interests of all investment parties. 
  Consisting of five chapters and 28 articles, the assessment 
and management procedures to be implemented have made explicit 
provisions on various issues, such as the purpose of formulating 
the procedures; the scope of their application; the competent 
assessment organs, assessment contents, methods, and procedures; 
and legal responsibility. 
  In light of actual conditions, newness, performance index, 
and technical parameters of foreign-invested assets and their 
profit- making ability, the State Administration of Import and 
Export Commodities Inspection will make assessments according to 
the methods laid down in the procedures, such as on-the-spot 
inspections technical detection, and value assessment, as well 
as other relevant provisions. The value assessment method 
includes the market method, the cost method, and the yield 
method. 
  In line with the assessment and management procedures, the 
State Administration of Import and Export Commodities Inspection 
will assess the value of assets according to the current market 
prices of the same or similar assets. It may redetermine their 
actual value according to actual conditions and length of use of 
the assessed assets, taking into account changes in their 
functions and other factors. Moreover, it will also calculate 
the current value of the assessed assets according to their 
rational estimated profit-making ability and appropriate 
depreciation rate.

"Maintain High Alert Against Leakage of Economic Secrets"] 
  [Text] Often recently, we have heard reports on leaks of 
economic secrets. For instance, Zhejiang's Shaoxing discovered 
at least 20 foreign economic spies who intended to steal the 
recipe for brewing Shaoxing liquor. A highly paid "garbage 
collector" in Guangzhou was employed by a certain company, which 
asked him to collect the industrial waste of another three 
companies in the same trade. As the company knew perfectly well 
the scientific research, production, and sales of those three 
companies, it maintained the upper hand in market competition. 
  Incidents of internal or external leakage of economic 
secrets 
are by no means accidental. There are many loopholes around us 
which are ignored and which can easily lead to leaks. Some 
regard documents labeled confidential as rubbish and throw them 
in the trashcan. Some people take secrets of the unit home and 
keep them anywhere they like. During trade talks with foreign 
businessmen, some staff of foreign trade units leak the state's 
import plans, giving the foreign party a chance to raise the 
prices. In order to strive for foreign investment and 
cooperation, some enterprises unreservedly allow the foreign 
party to visit, take photographs, and videotape, thus openly 
letting them steal production techniques. Some newspapers fail 
to ask for instructions or to undergo censorship before 
publishing a report. As a result, a number of reports involving 
economic secrets are made public. Moreover, some people, out of 
ulterior motives, present their outstanding products and recipes 
to the foreign party gratis. All these leaks have brought 
tremendous, irredeemable losses to the state. 
  With the gradual establishment of the socialist market 
economy system, our enterprises should enter into competition 
with their counterparts at home and abroad. In the world today, 
where the economy is developing by leaps and bounds, all 
countries have attached great and increasing importance to the 
mastery and obtaining of economic information. The smokeless 
war of internal and external economic information has never 
ceased. Unless we enhance the Chinese people's sense of 
maintaining internal and external economic secrets and avoid the 
occurrence of leaks, it will be impossible for us to have a 
foothold in domestic and international competition and to win 
victories on the battlefield of commerce. 
  For this reason, all enterprises should vigorously publicize 
the importance of maintaining internal and external economic 
secrets, heighten their vigilance, and earnestly implement the 
relevant regulations. It is necessary to establish and perfect 
the measures and system for keeping secrets; pay close attention 
to supervision, inspection, and implementation work; never give 
agents at home or abroad any chance to steal secrets; and close 
all the loopholes that might lead to the leaking of internal and 
external secrets.

<F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Ministry to Keep Urban Jobless Rate Below 3 </F>
Percent"] 
  [Text] The government is encouraging businesses to recruit 
more jobless people, in a bid to keep urban unemployment below 3 
percent this year. 
  And it is adopting preferential policies for those service 
industries who take on the unemployed, said Vice Labour Minister 
Zhu Jiazhen. 
  At a national labour and wage conference on Saturday, Zhu 
said the government would encourage the setting up of labour 
service companies that absorb idle workers. 
  Set up by State-owned firms or private businesses, labour 
service companies will be exempted from taxes and given priority 
in obtaining bank loans and materials if 60 percent of their 
jobs are given to the jobless or those who have been temporarily 
laid-off. 
  The urban unemployed are registered in cities and issued 
with 
certificates to help them seek re-employment. 
  To give these labour-intensive businesses more autonomy, the 
ministry will experiment with a shareholding system, said Zhu. 
  Previously, the decisionmaking powers of these labour 
service 
companies lay with the enterprises which set them up. The 
companies were thus prevented from using their own initiatives 
in their development. 
  And in addition to their wages, the employees in the firms 
will be paid bonuses according to the profits earned by the 
company, the vice minister said. 
  "One of the best ways to control unemployment is to give 
full 
play to the service industries irrespective of their ownership," 
said Zhu. Up till now, most labour service companies are run by 
State-owned enterprises. 
  The Ministry of Labour hopes to hold the unemployment rate 
to 
3 percent this year. Last year's 2.6 percent was up from 2.4 
percent in 1992. 
  Urban unemployment is expected to top 5 million this year. 
There were 4.1 million city dwellers out of work by the end of 
last year. 
  During the first quarter of the year, inflation hit 20.1 
percent, resulting in an increase in the level of unemployment 
in Chinese cities. This trend is worrying the government. 
  Another reason for the growth in the numbers of jobless is 
that the current economic readjustment has forced unprofitable 
State-owned enterprises to cut staff levels to raise efficiency. 
  Many State-owned firms are now in the red because of poor 
management, price hikes of production materials, and the new tax 
system which calculates more expenditures into costs. 
  To reduce the unemployment rate, the Labour Ministry has 
initiated a training programme in the hope of putting more 
unemployed into new jobs. 
  Instead of providing only financial relief to those out of 
work, the project aims to improve the quality of the workers 
with further training giving them more flexibility in their hunt 
for new jobs. 
  The Labour Ministry is also trying to include the urban 
employment index in the overall state economic plan, said Wang 
Dongyan, in charge of planning and wages at the Labour Ministry.

<F P=106> [China Daily News: "Growth Boom Continues in Foreign Trade"] </F>
  [Text] China's foreign trade has continued its 
double-digit growth in the first four months of this year, to 
hit a total volume of $57.84 billion, up 21 per cent over the 
same period of last year. customs officials said. 
  The export growth rate grew faster than that of imports, 
indicating that the macro-economic and reform measures adopted 
since late last year have paid off, according to officials in 
the General Administration of Customs (GAC). 
  Foreign-funded enterprises continued to set the pace in 
trade, as their exports and imports reached $21.33 billion, a 
46.9 per cent increase and accounting for nearly 37 per cent of 
the national trade volume. 
  During the January-April period, China's total imports grew 
by 20.3 per cent, amounting to $29.79 billion, while gross 
exports increased 22 per cent, hitting a total of $28.04 billion. 
  The export growth rate was a 3.3 per cent rise over that in 
the year's first quarter, according to statistics from the GAC. 
  This, the GAC officials said, also signaled that the 
government has put an end to the trend of a weak export growth 
against a runaway import boom. 
  However, in the four-month period, China's foreign trade 
still saw a deficit of $1.75 billion, only $20 million less than 
the same period of the previous year, the GAC officials said. 
  General merchandise exports recorded a 30.5 per cent lift 
with a total volume of $14.36 billion, which accounted for over 
half of all exports, while the processing trade maintained a 
high growth rate of over 23 per cent, totalling nearly $11.3 
billion. 
  But exports and imports through barter and border trade, 
respectively, plummeted 55 and 26 per cent, standing at a total 
of only $1.08 billion. 
  In the first four months this year, there were some major 
changes in the mix of China's exports as manufactured products 
witnessed a sharp rise of 25.6 per cent to $23.2 billion, 
accounting for 82.7 per cent of all exports.

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- China's exports grew 
faster than its imports in the first four months of this year. 
  This was revealed by the latest statistics from the Chinese 
Customs Department, which showed that the country's foreign 
trade volume was 21.1 percent greater than in the same period 
last year, with a total trade volume of 57.84 billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  Imports in the period totalled 29.79 billion U.S. dollars 
(up 
20.3 percent over the same period of 1993), while exports 
amounted to 28.04 billion U.S. dollars (up 22 percent). 
  That China's export growth rate is higher than the import 
one 
is attributed by experts to a series of macro-control measures 
and national foreign trade reform started in the latter half of 
last year and at the beginning of this year, in response to a 
then- growing trade deficit. 
  Japan is still the largest of all of China's trade partners: 
the bilateral trade volume reached 11.03 billion U.S. dollars, 
(up 34.9 percent), and made up 20.7 percent of the country's 
total foreign trade volume. 
  China's other large trade partners include Hong Kong, the 
European Community, the United States and Taiwan. 
  The trade volume of China's joint ventures reached 21.33 
billion U.S. dollars (up 46.9 percent), a much higher rise than 
the country's average foreign trade growth rate. The figure 
represents 36.9 percent of China's total foreign trade volume, 
compared with the 30.5 percent which this sector achieved in the 
same period last year.

<F P=106> [By Huang Jian (1806 0256): "The Actual Conditions, </F>
Problems, and Measures for Foreign-funded Enterprises in China"] 
  [Text] An important measure taken by China in its reform 
and opening to the world was to introduce foreign funds and 
technology into the country and run foreign-funded enterprises. 
This measure has achieved great success but, in reality, a lot 
of problems also exist. Since it is a long-term policy, it is 
necessary to study the actual conditions, problems, and measures 
for foreign-funded enterprises in the country. 
<H5>  I. The Basic Conditions in Foreign-funded Enterprises </H5>
  According to State Administration for Industry and Commerce 
statistics, by the end of 1992 there were 84,371 foreign-funded 
enterprises throughout the nation, accounting for 3 percent of 
all industrial and commercial corporate enterprises. Of these, 
34,288 are already in production and operation, accounting for 
40.6 percent of the registered foreign-funded enterprises. Of 
the registered foreign-funded enterprises, 55,826 are Chinese 
and foreign joint ventures, accounting for 66.2 percent of the 
total, while 14,180 are Chinese-foreign cooperative enterprises, 
accounting for 16.8 percent of the total, and 14,365 are 
exclusively foreign-owned enterprises, accounting for 17 percent 
of the total. The aggregate investment in foreign-funded 
enterprises throughout the nation amounted to $178.46 billion, 
with a registered capital of $116 billion and a foreign capital 
contribution of $68.66 billion. Of the 10.461 million 
employees, 293,000 are personnel working on behalf of the 
foreign party. 
  Trades in which foreign-funded enterprises have become 
involved cover almost every aspect of the national economy, with 
industry being the major one. Real estate and public utilities 
also take up a fairly big proportion. Besides, foreign-funded 
enterprises also take up a certain proportion in commerce and 
catering. In terms of primary, secondary, and tertiary 
industries, the proportions of enterprises are 2.6, 83.2, and 
14.2 percent respectively; the proportions of employees are 1.3, 
90.4, and 8.3 percent respectively; the proportions of aggregate 
investment are 1.5, 67, and 31.5 percent respectively; and the 
proportions of registered capital are 1.8, 70.6, and 27.6 
percent respectively. 
  Foreign enterprises throughout the nation are developing 
unevenly and they are concentrated in the open, coastal areas in 
southeastern China. Along the southeastern coast, they are 
concentrated in four provinces and one city, namely, Guangdong 
Province, Jiangsu Province, Fujian Province, Shanghai 
Municipality, and Shandong Province. Of these, Guangdong has 
achieved the most remarkable results in exploiting foreign 
funds. In terms of the number of foreign-funded enterprises, 
foreign invested funds, registered capital, and foreign capital 
contribution, they account for 31.2, 37, 37.2, and 43.2 percent 
respectively of the nation's total. 
  As for the countries and regions from whence the foreign 
funds come, for the time being, the overwhelming majority of the 
foreign funds come from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao. According 
to statistics, 68,887 enterprises are from Hong, Taiwan and 
Macao, their aggregate investment stands at $144.2 billion, 
their registered capital $93.23 billion, and their capital 
contribution $55.76 billion, each accounting for over 80 percent 
of the total foreign capital. Besides, the number of 
enterprises from the United States, Japan, and Singapore and 
their aggregate investment account for around 12 percent of the 
total, while enterprises from six countries, namely, the UK, 
France, Germany, Canada, Italy, and Australia add up to no more 
than 2.4 percent of the total. 
<H5>  II. The Main Problems in the Development of Foreign-Funded </H5>
Enterprises 
  1. The relationship between the development of 
foreign-funded enterprises and that of state-owned enterprises 
  The development of foreign funded enterprises plays an 
active, as well as a negative, role in promoting the development 
of state-owned enterprises. Given that state-owned enterprises 
lack vitality, the preferential policies adopted by the state 
toward foreign-funded enterprises has put state-owned 
enterprises in a very unfavorable position in the intensely 
competitive market. In terms of taxation, foreign-funded 
enterprises enjoy income tax exemption for the first three years 
and a reduction in tax for the next two. In some areas, the 
duration of tax exemption and reduction is even longer and the 
actual taxation even lower. In 1992, the average tax handed 
over by foreign-funded enterprises which had gone into 
production or operations was only 68,000 yuan. However, the 
income tax rate of state-owned enterprises has just been reduced 
from 55 percent to 33 percent this year. Their actual taxation 
is still much more than foreign-funded enterprises. In terms of 
enterprise autonomy, foreign-funded enterprises enjoy various 
decisionmaking powers on manpower, finances, materials, 
production, supply, and sales. They feel comfortable as fish in 
water in the market. However, the management autonomy for 
state-owned enterprises is not fully granted and, consequently, 
they often bungle their opportunities. In terms of retirement 
and insurance for workers and staff members, the burden om 
foreign-funded enterprises is light as they chiefly employ young 
people while state-owned enterprises not only have to be 
responsible for the insurance of their employees but also their 
retirement pay. In terms of import and export rights, 
foreign-funded enterprises at large enjoy the right to declare 
to customs or the import and export rights and they are not 
restricted by the import and export permit system. They also 
retain all the foreign exchange and use it without restriction, 
whereas most of the state-owned enterprises do not have 
corresponding rights. They needs permits for the import and 
export of goods. Moreover, they have to hire foreign trade 
agents. 
  They keep a small proportion of the foreign 
exchange earnings but cannot use it directly and freely. The 
crucial point of restructuring our economy lies in enlivening 
state-owned enterprises. The basis and the main force for 
socialist modernization lies in state-owned enterprises. Whe, 
competing with foreign-funded enterprises which have absolute 
advantages, state-owned enterprises will lose repeatedly, the 
profit-making ones becoming loss-making ones and the loss-making 
ones being driven into bankruptcy because of their imperfect 
mechanism, the unequal policies, and their lack of sufficient 
strength for technical innovation and management improvement. 
This has deviated from the starting point of utilizing foreign 
funds, delayed the course of enterprise reform, and impaired the 
healthy development of the whole national economy. How to 
combine the development of foreign-funded enterprises with the 
invigoration of the state-owned enterprises so that we can 
attract foreign funds, while protecting and promoting the 
rejuvenation of state-owned enterprises, is a problem of first 
importance which deserves our study. 
  2. The investment orientation of foreign funds 
  The principal demerits of foreign funds in terms of 
investment orientation are: Items of general industrial 
processing are many while items of agriculture, energy, 
communications, and raw materials which the national economy 
needs urgently are few; primary processing and labor-intensive 
industries are many in number while high-tech and 
technology-intensive ones are few; projects of small and medium 
enterprises are many while big ones are few. Of the total 
investment, agriculture accounts for only 1.54 percent, energy 
and raw materials 0.1 percent, and communications and transport, 
as well as post and telecommunications, 1.8 percent. From the 
foreign businessman's viewpoint, factors affecting their 
investment orientation finclude the fact that those small 
processing projects need small investment but bring quick 
results, yield good profits, involve little risk, and are good 
for giving full play to the superiority of manpower. On our 
part, the main factors that affect the investment orientation 
are that some localities attach importance to quantity rather 
than quality. They evaluate their achievements by counting how 
many foreign-funded enterprises have been set up without 
sufficient knowledge of the investment orientation, technical 
level, market orientation, and scale of foreign investment, as 
well as the technique and credit worthiness of the foreign 
businessmen. The irrational orientation of foreign investment 
brings hidden troubles. It is disadvantageous to restructuring 
our industry and upgrading technology. In the long run, it will 
do harm to the even and healthy development of the national 
economy. 
  3. The management of foreign-funded enterprises 
  A. Foreign capital fails to show up. According to an 
analysis by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, 
5,000 of the 25,000 foreign-funded enterprises across the 
country have not invested any money. Some foreign businessmen 
withdrew their funds by installments soon after making 
investments but continued to enjoy preferential treatment for 
foreign-funded enterprise. 
  B. The deficit rate of enterprises exceeds 40 percent. Some 
enterprises lose money because of failure to select the right 
project. Some fail in business because the foreign businesses 
play an underhand game in import and export. A considerable 
number of enterprises actually make profits though they claim 
losses. 
  C. Goods produced by foreign-funded enterprises are not 
exported abroad according to the proportion set in contracts. 
Instead, they squeeze into and occupy the domestic market, 
affecting the state's foreign exchange revenue. From 1991 to 
1992, the imports by foreign-funded enterprises stood at $43.3 
billion while their exports totaled $29.4 billion. After 
deducting $12.7 billion for investment in equipment and other 
articles, the international trade deficit was $1.2 billion. 
  D. Serious tax evasion. In 1991, the average unified 
industrial and commercial tax handed over by foreign-funded 
enterprises which were in operation, was 242,000 yuan and the 
income tax was 76,000 yuan. In 1992, the average unified 
industrial and commercial tax handed over by them was 243,000 
yuan and the income tax was only 68,000 yuan. Foreign-funded 
enterprises pay the salary of employees under the name of 
subsidies so that they can evade personal income tax and 
individual income regulatory tax. The lack of perfect laws and 
regulations contributes to the difficulties in administering 
foreign-funded enterprises. What is more serious is that the 
Chinese party to the joint venture, proceeding from their local 
interests, share the preferential policy with foreign 
businessmen at the cost of national interests and the interests 
of the whole. 
  4. The investment environment of using foreign funds 
  From the angle of the international environment, 
international opinion generally holds that China's economic 
growth and market have great potential. The number of foreign 
businessmen who intend to invest in China keeps increasing. On 
the other hand, the economies of some Eastern European countries 
are gradually recovering and the momentum of economic growth in 
our neighboring countries is not decreasing. So, the 
competition to introducing international capital tends to become 
fiercer. In addition, some Western countries are wary of us 
politically so that, to a considerable extent, transnational 
corporations and big financial groups are hesitant and take a 
wait-and-see attitude toward investment in China. From the 
angle of the domestic environment, some areas are backward in 
conditions such as transportation, energy resources, and 
communications. The relevant laws and regulations on using 
foreign funds are imperfect. The operation mechanism of the 
market economy has not been finally established. All this has 
brought certain difficulties to the normal operations of 
foreign-funded enterprises and, therefore, has affected the 
introduction of international capital and the healthy 
development of foreign-funded enterprises. 
  III. Development Tendencies and Some Suggestions 
  1. The foreign-funded enterprises will indicate the 
following characteristics for some time to come: 
  A. The number of foreign-funded enterprises and aggregate 
investment will increase steadily. Sino-foreign joint ventures 
will still be the main form of enterprises and the actual 
investment funds will exceed the foreign loans of our country. 
  B. Foreign-funded enterprises will mainly be industrial ones 
and will gradually develop towards infrastructure and basic 
industries. There will be considerably big development and 
breakthroughs in the tertiary industry. However, the 
development of new and high-tech projects and capital-intensive 
ones will still be restricted in certain extent. 
  C. The export and import scale of foreign-funded enterprises 
will increase fairly quickly. Because quite a number of 
foreign-funded enterprises are grafted from town and township 
enterprises as well as small and medium state-owned enterprises, 
they are small in scale and exports. The contradiction of 
imbalanced foreign exchange will exist for a long time and 
sometimes will become very conspicuous. 
  D. Foreign-funded enterprises will still mainly be located 
in the economically developed coastal areas, along rivers, and 
in the border areas and they will develop in quite a big way. 
  E. Taiwan and Hong Kong will remain the chief sources of 
foreign funds and the investment from the United States, Japan, 
the ROK, and Southeast Asian countries will increase steadily. 
  2. Some suggestions: 
  A. Emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and 
strengthen leadership over the use foreign funds. Three 
tendencies should be overcome: First is the tendency to compete 
with one another in offering foreign businessmen preferential 
policies; second, is the tendency to pay attention to quantity 
rather than quality in the development of foreign-funded 
enterprises; and third, is the tendency to duplicate imports and 
fail in absorption. Exchange of information and project 
guidance should be strengthened. A good job should be done in 
the introduction, digestion, and absorption of advanced foreign 
technology and not just simply taking it over. 
  B. Continue to improve the investment environment. Further 
efforts should be made to improve the hard environment such as 
traffic, transportation, energy, post and telecommunications, 
and communications. At the same time, the laws and regulations 
concerning foreign-funded enterprises should be perfected to 
protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded 
enterprises. The procedures and links to set up foreign-funded 
enterprises should be simplified to raise work efficiency. We 
should quicken the steps of the reform, establish the operation 
mechanism of the market economy, and reduce the contradictions 
and frictions between the current system and the operation of 
foreign-funded enterprises. We should also strengthen publicity 
on the use of foreign funds abroad, restore and build the 
international image of China, and publicize China's economic 
achievements and potential for development in a realistic way, 
to raise its attractiveness to foreign funds. 
  C. Stress the main points in strengthening guidance to 
foreign investment orientation. The focus of investment is in 
projects of basic industries, infrastructure, and high 
technology. With regard to projects regarding energy and 
communications in particular, we should further relax our policy 
and boldly attract foreign funds to serve us. To such 
businesses as trading, tourism, and banking, we can liberalize 
our policy a bit more so that they can develop appropriately. 
As for some high-tech projects, especially products which can 
replace imported ones, we should offer a bigger proportion for 
internal sale to promote the enthusiasm of the foreign 
businessmen for investment and further investment. Some 
localities assign large areas of farmland for sale or lease at 
low prices to foreign businessmen to develop real estate. 
Although this practice brings some immediate interests and 
temporary prosperity, its disadvantages outweigh its advantages 
in the long run. The lesson to be drawn from Japan's bubble 
economy in the 1980s is worth our learning. We should properly 
control the excessive growth of foreign-funded real estate. 
  E. Raise the level of management of foreign-funded 
enterprises. It is necessary to formulate laws and regulations 
to bring about the timely arrival of registered capital in the 
full amount, strengthen inspection and supervision, and change 
the existing phenomenon whereby the Chinese party alone takes 
the operating risks if the foreign capital does not come. To 
strengthen tax management, the state should set the minimum 
standard for the policy which offers income tax deduction and 
exemption to foreign-funded enterprises and rectify the tendency 
for each locality to go its own way. On the other hand, we 
should screen pseudo-foreign-funded enterprises, especially 
those which still enjoy preferential treatment for 
foreign-funded enterprises but which actually have very little 
proportion of foreign funds or from which the foreign funds have 
been withdrawn. At the same time, we should strengthen 
financial supervision to prevent enterprises from evading tax by 
falsely claiming losses when they have actual made a profit and 
the abnormal phenomenon whereby the state has little increase in 
tax revenue while the number of foreign-funded enterprises keeps 
increasing. We should strengthen the supervision and management 
of imports and exports by foreign-funded enterprises to prevent 
them from taking advantage of the preferential policy to import 
equipment and raw materials which have nothing to do with 
production and then selling them at high prices for profits. We 
should also prevent them from selling their products to the 
domestic market directly or changing the goods originally 
assigned for export into goods for domestic sales without 
sticking to the proportion set by contract. The number of 
Chinese employees working in the joint ventures now exceeds 10 
million. We should protect their legitimate rights in terms of 
working conditions, medical insurance, labor insurance, and 
endowment insurance and, at the same time, collect individual 
income regulatory taxes according to regulations to ease the 
phenomenon of inequality in social distribution.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Top Government Trade Mission Woos HK </F>
Investors"] 
  [Text] The mainland is sending a top level trade and 
investment delegation to Hong Kong later this month, it was 
announced in Beijing yesterday. 
  The 160-member mission plans to offer 760 business projects 
on the mainland to investors from Hong Kong, and other Southeast 
Asian countries, said the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Co-operation (Moftec). 
  "Most of the investment projects will be available to the 
public for the first time," said Ma Xiuhong, deputy 
director-general of foreign investment at Moftec. 
  The trade and investment forums, which will run May 23-26, 
have been organized by Moftec and the Hong Kong Trade 
Development Council. 
  "And we have deliberately included projects in many 
provinces 
and cities from the country's central and western parts," Ma 
said. 
  The preferential economic deals previously only offered to 
the coastal regions are being extended to areas in the interior. 
  The current special economic zones along the coast offer tax 
breaks. 
  But uniform policies across the country are the basic demand 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which 
China wants to re-enter. 
  The trade-boost visit to Hong Kong is the first of its kind, 
Ma said. 
  Moftec Vice-Minister Zheng Silin will lead the delegation, 
which comprises representatives from four ministries and 24 
provinces and cities. 
  These include the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry 
of 
Electronics Industry, the China National Non-ferrous Metals 
Corporation and the China North Industry Group. 
  Overseas investment grew faster in the interior than it did 
along the coast last year, she said. 
  Wu Yi, Moftec Minister, said that central and western parts 
of China, which are abundant in natural resources, will 
experience an economic boom in the next century. 
  Hong Kong investors have gradually expanded their interests 
in the hinterland, Ma said. 
  "And more and more Hong Kong businesses have invested in 
infrastructure sectors, like power stations and railways," she 
said. 
  More than 90 of the proposed businesses are in the chemical 
sector. 
  And over 110 of them are big infrastructure projects. 
  Light industry and electronics schemes each account for more 
than 80 of the investment proposals. 
  And over 160 machinery businesses will be on offer.

<F P=106> [By Bayani Cruz] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese government is making it more difficult 
for foreign joint ventures to repatriate their foreign exchange 
earnings, in a bid to exercise more control over the country's 
foreign exchange transactions. The new restrictions are 
contained in provisional regulations drafted by the State 
Administration of Exchange Control (SAEC) Commission in 
coordination with the Bank of China (BOC), according to the 
China Newsletter published by Price Waterhouse. 
  Although the new regulations had not yet been released, they 
reportedly contained stiffer procedural requirements regarding 
the repatriation of foreign exchange earnings by "foreign 
investment enterprises". "Foreign investment enterprises" are 
joint ventures between foreign investors and local Chinese. 
  Under the new regulations, there will be an increase in the 
number of approvals required of foreign investment enterprises 
that wish to repatriate forex earnings. For example, if, at the 
application stage, a new foreign investment enterprise did not 
envisage it would be able to balance its foreign exchange books, 
it has to seek SAEC approval, according to Price Waterhouse. 
  Without SAEC approval, a foreign investment enterprise may 
not be granted access to the forex swap centres at a later date, 
Price Waterhouse said. The new rules would also make it 
mandatory for foreign investment enterprises with overseas 
offices to remit any foreign exchange "hard currency" earnings 
back to China instead of keeping them abroad. However, the 
foreign investment enterprises would be allowed to keep the 
remitted foreign exchange earnings in their own accounts, rather 
than being required to sell their foreign exchange to the Bank 
of China. 
  Few foreign investment enterprises are expected to be 
affected by the mandatory remittance requirement, because, while 
there are currently many foreign joint ventures on the mainland, 
few of them have existing overseas offices. 
  Also under the new regulations, the State Planning 
Commission 
may draw up two lists of businesses: those that are restricted 
(class A) and those that are promoted (class B) under current 
policies, Price Waterhouse's newsletter said. Foreign 
investment enterprises engaged in class A businesses may only be 
given access to swap centres for a three-year period, during 
which time they would be required to demonstrate their ability 
to balance their foreign exchange books. Those engaged in class 
B businesses, such as power station projects, would be granted 
SAEC approval to use the swap centres without the additional 
restrictions imposed on class A enterprises, Price Waterhouse 
said. 
  There has been a lot of activity in the area of foreign 
exchange controls by Beijing since the beginning of this year, 
according to bankers. The SAEC and the BOC have been drafting a 
number of regulations intended to restrict repatriation of 
foreign exchange and strengthen remittance requirements. The 
policies of restrictive trend towards foreign exchange stems 
from the Chinese government's efforts to cope with its balance 
of payments difficulties.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Hainan To Allow Foreign Businessmen </F>
To Buy Shares in State Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Haikou, 12 May (LIEN HO PAO)--It has been learned 
that the Hainan Special Economic Region recently announced that 
trade, automobile transportation, and accounting offices have 
been opened to foreign businessmen. 
  In the financial field, the Hainan Special Region currently 
has three foreign-invested financial organizations. It is 
planned that three more foreign-invested banks and two 
foreign-invested insurance companies will be set up this year, 
and one or two relatively large investment companies run by 
foreign businessmen will be set up on a trial basis. 
  In the commercial field, foreign businessmen will be 
encouraged to run shops selling brand-name commodities, gift 
boutiques, chain stores, large shopping arcades, and 
joint-venture supermarkets. The commerce and investment in the 
Yangpu Development Zone and the Haikou Bonded Zone will be 
opened fully, and foreign businessmen will be able to set up 
joint-venture, cooperative, or solely-owned commercial 
organizations and operate large shopping arcades. 
  In the foreign trade field, foreign businessmen will be 
allowed to invest in enterprises, to have shares of enterprises 
in the province which have the right to import and export goods, 
or to jointly run these enterprises in a bid to give full play 
to the strong points of foreign capital and domestic capital and 
to let them supplement each other. 
  Likewise, in addition to allowing foreign businessmen to 
invest in the construction of superhighways, railways, ports, 
and wharves, and to operate these projects, they will be able to 
invest in automobile transportation. Preferential policies will 
also be implemented and comprehensive compensation will be made. 
  Hainan will also allow foreign businessmen to invest in and 
operate airport construction, aircraft maintenance, and airport 
services projects. First rate foreign airlines with a good 
reputation will be invited to take part in such projects, and 
one or two Sino-foreign joint venture or cooperative airlines 
will be set up on a trial basis. Hainan will also set up one or 
two foreign- invested accountant offices and lawyers' offices on 
a trial basis. The lawyer agency system will be gradually 
implemented in a bid to speed up the convergence of Hainan's 
tertiary industry with international norms. 
  Hainan will allow foreign businessmen to buy shares of state 
enterprises and to take over or annex state enterprises. Hainan 
will also allow foreign businessmen to transform state 
enterprises through leasing and contracting.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- A considerable portion 
of stocks scheduled to be issued this year will be postponed to 
1995 following a recent government decision to standardize the 
listed companies and stock trading. 
  A press release issued by the State Council Securities 
Committee (SCSC) here today says that China's stock market is 
still in its infancy, therefore its development should be a 
step-by-step process and pursued on an experimental basis. 
  To ensure the quality of listing companies, from now on 
enterprises should accept a six-month-long coaching by relevant 
departments before they begin public stock offerings. The 
coaching aims to help enterprises build up a mechanism in line 
with a share- holding company, according to the press release. 
  The coaching period will be extend to twelve months in 1996, 
before and after an enterprise issues stocks. 
  With the introduction of the coaching system, stock issue 
plans of most enterprises will have to be postponed until next 
year. The stock issuing quotas local governments have received 
for 1994 will be effective in 1995. 
  This year, the stock issuing will be linked with bank 
deposits and issue prices will be controlled, the press release 
says. 
  Meanwhile, the government will enhance supervision of share- 
holding companies and stock trading. 
  A guideline for enterprise management transformation will be 
worked out and the stock trading system will be further improved 
to prevent market manipulation and insider-trading. 
  Violators including securities companies and individuals 
will 
be punished according to law. 
  Institutional investors with long-term investment schemes 
will be the backbone of the future stock market. Therefore open 
investment funds will be set up when the time is proper, the 
press release says. 
  This year, the government will increase B share issues and 
no 
domestic enterprise should go public on the overseas market 
without SCSC approval or become a listed company on the overseas 
market through buying into a listed shell company, the press 
release says.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- A prominent figure in 
China's securities industry today said the Chinese stock market 
has entered a period of readjustment but remains promising. 
  Commenting on the recent sluggish performance of China's 
stock market, Guan Jinsheng, president of the Shanghai 
International Securities Co. Ltd (Sisco), said that it is only 
natural for the market to plummet after the share prices were 
sent through the roof. 
  "China's stock market is so young that it fluctuates 
wildly," 
Guan said. 
  At present, the share indexes at the Shanghai Stock Exchange 
dived below 620 points while those at the Shenzhen exchange 
dropped underneath the level of 170 points. This is in sharp 
contrast with the bullish mood a year ago. 
  "The falling of the share indexes was inevitable," Guan 
said, 
citing China's macro-economic control measures as a reason. 
  "Undoubtedly they have a certain bearing on the stumble -- 
the stock market always eases when interest rates are put up to 
dampen inflation -- it's a common scene all over the world, Guan 
added. [no closing quotation marks as received] 
  But the stock market plunge mainly resulted from its 
intricate structural problems, Guan stressed. It is due to the 
fact that share-trading and share-offering are closely related 
to each other, he said. 
  Yet in share-offering, their magnitudes are strictly 
controlled, only to neglect the quality of the listed companies 
and enterprises [as received], he said. 
  He called on securities companies, which act as 
underwriters, 
to bear the responsibility and obligation to ensure the quality 
of their clients. 
  Certified public accountancy firms should also help in this 
regard by carefully checking the re-evaluation of the assets and 
financial reports; and stock exchanges and supervisory organs 
should fend off any administrative interferences wherever they 
come from, he said. 
  He also expressed concern over the dominating speculative 
attitude in the trading of stocks and pinned the blame on the 
flawed composition of investors. Now about eight million 
individual investors are pulling together efforts to prop up a 
market of nearly 300 billion yuan in market value -- it can only 
make sense after institutions and funds join in, he said. 
  The stock market can hopefully keep stable only when 50-100 
funds, each of which has billions yuan of assets, are involved 
to select shares and enterprises for long-term investment, he 
added. 
  Guan became optimistic when talking about the future of 
China's stock market and predicted a period of substantive 
development in the coming few years. 
  With the gradual perfection of its macro-economic control 
system, Guan said, China will be capable of avoiding vicious 
inflation and attaining rapid economic growth. "There is no 
reason to believe the prospects of the stock market -- a 
barometer of the economy -- are not bright," Guan said. 
  He said the establishment of a modern enterprise system in 
China will give rise to new channels and instruments of 
financing and eventually the trade of property rights, which are 
bound to stimulate the development of the securities industry. 
  Another contributing factor is the formation of a team of 
supervisory as well as operating personnel over the past few 
years since China began to embrace the stock market as a means 
of financing.

(0002 1017 6900)] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
held a teleconference at Zhongnanhai this afternoon in order to 
ensure that further efforts will be made to do a good job in 
issuing state treasury bonds. Luo Gan, state councillor and 
secretary general of the State Council, spoke at the conference. 
  Luo Gan said: A good start has been made in issuing the 
two-year term and three-year term state treasury bonds this 
year. [passage omitted] According to statistics, as of 27 
April, 41.6 billion yuan worth of treasury bonds had been sold 
throughout the country, representing 47.8 percent of the planned 
total number of bonds to be issued. The figure included 15.8 
billion yuan worth of two-year term state treasury bonds and 
25.8 billion yuan worth of three-year term state treasury bonds. 
[passage omitted] 
  Luo Gan said: The issuance of state treasury bonds this year 
is very significant. It concerns the overall situation of 
reform, development, and stability. To maintain a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, 
safeguard political stability, and promote overall social 
progress, we must fulfill our financial plans, especially the 
plan for the issuance of state treasury bonds, according to 
schedule this year. 
  Luo Gan pointed out: We have done pretty well in issuing 
state treasury bonds in the past month, but to fulfill this 
year's plan we still have arduous tasks to do. The State 
Council believes that at present, governments at all levels 
should lose no time in concentrating on work that is related to 
the issuance of state treasury bonds. [passage omitted] 
  Vice Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng and Vice President 
of the People's Bank of China Dai Xianglong spoke at the 
teleconference. They endorsed the guidelines contained in Luo 
Gan's speech and called on financial and monetary departments at 
all levels to further do a good job in issuing state treasury 
bonds. 
  The conference was presided over by He Chunlin, deputy 
secretary general of the State Council. Finance Minister Liu 
Zhongli and leaders of relevant departments under the State 
Council and major monetary organizations attended the conference.

  [Text] Mainland authorities asked some co-underwriters of 
the Tianjin Bohai Chemical public offered to take up shares 
offered to avoid an undersubscription, it has been revealed. 
Sources at the underwriting pool said that Peregrine Capital 
and S.G. Warburg had been asked by the Beijing authorities to 
take up a portion of the shares they had underwritten. 
  Officially, the Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry's 
340-million 
H-share issue was oversubscribed 0.25 times. However, a source 
suggested the issue could have been undersubscribed by as much 
as 30 per cent, if it had not been for the late applications 
which came as the offer was due to close. 
  The Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry's issue marks the 
weakest 
of the H-share subscriptions, receiving only 340.86 million 
share applications compared to Shanghai Petrochemical, the next 
lowest, whose $2.9 billion share issue last July was 0.74 times 
oversubscribed. 
  The Tianjin Bohai public offering closed at noon on May 6, 
but the number of applications seemed to fall short of the 
amount offered early in the morning, sources said. Some of the 
co- underwriters received calls from the mainland authorities 
requesting them to file more applications. 
  The issue's sponsor and lead underwriter, Jardine Fleming, 
said it had not been approached by the authorities to take up 
any positions. "We are acting as an agency broking house. It 
is not our style to support the issue by taking up positions for 
ourselves before the offering has closed," said Gerry Yim, 
associate director of Jardine Fleming corporate finance. 
  But one of the underwriters said: "The mainland authorities' 
attempt to whitewash the subscription indicates its unrealistic 
attitude to H-share issues and a high expectation of the 
merchant banks. 
  "It is not facing up to the problems and still believes that 
everything about H-share listings must go right." 
  However, Mr Yim said they were not aware of some 
co-underwriters being asked by the mainland authorities to take 
up the subscriptions. He added they had closely monitored the 
subscription and communicated with the Beijing authority 
throughout the offering. "We have done our best as a sponsor and 
underwriter," said Mr Yim. 
  Under the current underwriting system, the lead 
underwriters, 
Jardine Fleming and China Development Finance, an offshoot of 
the Bank of China, were to take up the shortfall in shares if 
the issue was undersubscribed. But they appear to have been 
bypassed, with the co-underwriters being asked to pick up the 
extra shares. The underwriting syndicate comprised eight 
co-underwriters and six principal sub-underwriters. 
  One local merchant banker suggested there were two ways to 
prevent an undersubscription of an initial public offering. A 
simple method was for major shareholders to ask their "friends" 
to apply for the shares. Alternatively, underwriters would 
request their fund management divisions to subscribe to the 
shares. 
  Under Stock Exchange of Hong Kong rules, underwriters can 
direct their associate operations, such as fund management arms, 
to acquire shares during the initial offer period and the 
information does not have to be disclosed. 
  It is considered a whitewash or face-saving approach to 
subscribe for the shares at the last minute and take positions 
and sell the shares when they think the time is appropriate. 
Very often, the major shareholder or some financial advisers 
would be the market makers and the downside risk is therefore 
lessened.

  [Text] China's lumbering state sector is switching from 
relying on loans from supra-nationals and direct foreign 
investment to sourcing funds from global equity markets. The 
remarks, made in Hong Kong yesterday by Liu Hongru, chief of the 
China Securities Regulatory Commission, come as the moribund 
enterprises face the worse credit squeeze in years. There are 
concerns that the enterprises, considered the backbone of the 
economy, will be the biggest obstacle to the country's economic 
reform programmes. 
  Mr Liu said that issuing shares directly to foreign 
investors 
by enterprises was a more flexible way of sourcing funds and 
could supplement loan financing. "This will allow foreigners to 
take a longer view on our economy and help enterprises transform 
their operation mechanism," he told a seminar on raising capital 
in the United States for mainland and Hong Kong enterprises. 
  The US has been designated as the second capital market for 
raising funds by Chinese state-owned enterprises after Hong 
Kong. Mr Liu said the commission would not relax its standards 
to allow fast listings on US exchanges. He said there were five 
Chinese enterprises among the second batch of companies 
short-listed for listings in the US. "The enterprises will be 
listed only when (they are) up to scratch. We aim for quality 
rather than speed," Mr Liu said. 
  The five companies are China Eastern Airlines China Southern 
Airlines, Shandong Huaneng Electricity, Huaneng International 
Power Development and Tianjin Steel Pipe. "It is imperative to 
select some enterprises for direct listing in the US because it 
is the world's biggest capital market, which has the highest 
liquidity and provides the best protection for shareholders," he 
said. 
  Mr Liu said the five companies were now doing listing 
preparation work. "Some have named underwriters, accountants 
and lawyers, while some have completed assets and capital 
verification," he said. The enterprises had been channelling 
funds from international organisations such as the World Bank, 
and from direct foreign investment, including joint ventures. 
However, Mr Liu said: "Under the current situation, it is not 
sufficient just to rely on these various foreign investments." 
He was speaking in the context of an economy in which 
substantial capital was needed in fundamental industries such as 
energy, transportation and infrastructure. 
  "The domestic capital market cannot meet the country's 
massive demand for funds," he said, explaining the need to raise 
foreign capital through different channels. 
  The experiment of listing state-owned enterprises abroad had 
proved a success, he said, with $11 billion being raised for the 
first batch for listings in Hong Kong. "On the basis of the 
results of these experimental listings, it can be concluded that 
the responses of the global securities markets and international 
investors have been overwhelmingly good," Mr Liu said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- By the end of 1995, 
foreign funds going to China's posts and telecommunications 
construction will total five billion U.S. dollars, according to 
an official from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
(MPT). 
  The official said that China's input in posts and 
telecommunications construction for the Eighth Five-Year Plan 
(1991- 1995) will reach 160 billion yuan, while in the newly 
drafted Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), the total budget is a 
huge 360 billion yuan. 
  To provide sufficient posts and telecommunications capacity 
for the fast development of the economy, China has been 
increasing investment in the construction of posts and 
telecommunications infrastructures year by year. In 1993 an 
investment of 40.4 billion yuan was finished, while this year's 
budget hit 53.6 billion yuan. 
  The official said that in addition to a small amount of 
money 
from the central government, a major part of the funds will come 
from investment by local governments, domestic loans and 
overseas investors. 
  The official said that during the Seventh Five-Year Plan 
(1986- 1990) the MPT used 1.1 billion U.S. dollars of overseas 
funds, and thereafter, foreign funds going to this sector have 
been increasing by a big margin each year. 
  Foreign funds have been used mainly for buying advanced 
technologies and equipment, such as optical fiber cables, 
switchboards, mobile telecommunications equipment and mobile 
telephone production lines. 
  At present the MPT and the Ministry of Electronics Industry 
are joining hands to tackle some high-tech projects in the field 
of telecommunications, and are actively preparing for 
construction of China's telecommunications superhighway. 
  In addition, the MPT also plans to buy 15 planes in the 
coming few years to open special postal air routes. 
  All these projects need support from foreign funds and 
technologies, the official said. 
  In fact, the world's large telecommunications enterprises, 
such as Motorola, Siemens and NEC, have already taken a share in 
China's huge investment market for posts and telecommunications 
construction. 
  Meanwhile, many other foreign companies would not spare a 
single chance to enter the Chinese market. Every time China 
publishes a new telecommunications project, a dozen foreign 
companies come at once to compete for contracts. 
  Wu Jichuan, minister of MPT, made a speech to a national 
posts and telecommunications conference this week, stressing 
again to expand international cooperation and promote the use of 
foreign funds. 
  Wu said that in addition to overseas loans and other 
traditional patterns for using funds, the MPT will, with 
ratification from the central government, choose some qualified 
industrial enterprises to issue shares on the Hong Kong Stock 
Exchange; the MPT will also buy equipment from Hong Kong with 
foreign currencies borrowed right there. 
  At the same time the minister reiterated that foreign 
businessmen are not allowed to manage or participate in the 
managing of public telecommunications networks and special 
telecommunications networks within Chinese territories.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Representatives from 
China's telecommunications circles gathered here today to 
celebrate the 26th "World Telecommunications Day". 
  Twenty-six years ago, the international Telecommunications 
Union (ITU) chose May 17 as World Telecommunications Day. 
  Ni Yifeng, vice-director of the Telecommunications Bureau 
under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, said that 
ITU has defined "telecommunications and culture" as the theme of 
this year's telecommunications day, which reflects the close 
relationship between telecommunications and the world's cultural 
development. 
  Ni said that the development of telecommunications will 
enable mankind to enjoy the cream of the world's culture more 
extensively and will provide new Opportunities for cultural 
development. 
  He said that, as a member of ITU, China has for many years 
maintained close and friendly relations with foreign countries 
in this industry and has made great achievements in developing 
China's telecommunications industry and exchanges with foreign 
partners. 
  Ni said that in recent years China's telecommunications 
industry has been developing fairly fast: 
  -- Telephones are available for more and more families. By 
the end of 1993 the country's operating telephones reached 26.13 
million lines, of which 57 percent are family telephones. 
  -- New telecommunications services are expanding. By the end 
of last year, 1,709 cities had established wireless paging 
services, with more than 5.61 million subscribers, becoming the 
world's third largest wireless paging network; over 800 cities 
have mobile telephone services, with more than 700,000 
subscribers. 
  -- The national public telecommunications network has made 
obvious improvement in developing capability for comprehensive 
social services. By the end of last year, the capacity of the 
national telephone network had reached 42.06 million lines, 
while long-distance telephones reached 420,000 lines. 
  Ni said that by the end of this century, China will have a 
modern telecommunications network with large capacity, advanced 
technology, and highly efficient, high-quality services to cater 
to various social demands.

<F P=106> [By Foo Choy Peng] </F>
  [Text] In a bold move to break the stranglehold the 
overburdened transport system has on the economy, China is 
planning a radical shift in pricing policies designed to 
encourage efficiency. Beijing hopes that, by selectively 
lifting price controls in the transport sector, it will open the 
way for more foreign investment in the cash-starved sector. 
  According to China analysts, the ministries of railways and 
communications are pushing to have a market-based pricing system 
for some types of transport. But when, and to what extent, the 
changes will take place, depends on the state of the economy and 
the level of inflation. 
  Enterprises operating general transport facilities such as 
ports, airports and highways, would be given complete autonomy 
to set prices on the basis of supply and demand. At present, 
enterprises running ports, highways and airports enjoy a degree 
of flexibility in setting prices, but railways do not. 
  But deregulation in areas run as monopolies, such as the 
railways, would be partial and gradual. In these cases, the 
state would continue to fix general price levels but enterprises 
would be given some leeway to set fares. However, price 
deregulation is inflationary and, at a time of double-digit 
inflation, would tend to be politically unpalatable. 
  The proposed pricing shift is part of a package designed to 
revitalise the ramshackle transport sector. The package also 
would involve deeper reforms to improve management of transport, 
establish an effective fund-raising and investment system, and a 
clearer separation of roles between local and state governments 
in transport projects. 
  A multi-pronged approach to improve management would 
include: 
  -- Greater delegation of the control of ports and airports. 
  -- Strengthening the experiment to set up railway 
conglomerates. 
  -- Singling out a few enterprises to try out the 
shareholding 
system. 
  -- Encouraging conglomerates to expand into other related 
industries. 
  Hong Kong analysts applauded the measures, adding that the 
rigid pricing policy dictated by the state had long discouraged 
foreign investors. Vincent Chan, an economist with Peregrine 
Investments Holdings, said: "The biggest problem facing China's 
transport sector is the shortage of funds, and we're talking 
about investments in the region of hundreds of millions of US 
dollars. 
  "And, when the state controls the prices, it means that they 
are set way below the cost of operation, which means it is 
unattractive to any foreign investor." A Peregrine survey 
released last week shows that China needs to invest as much as 
US$111 billion in the transport sector to improve its railways, 
highways, airports and ports. 
  One analyst said that under existing circumstances, the only 
way to interest foreign investors would be to guarantee a rate 
of return. "But even a guaranteed rate of return may not be 
attractive enough. Look at the case of the power industry. 
Although China guarantees a rate of return of about 15 per 
cent, foreign investors feel the rate is not high enough to 
compensate for the risk they are taking," he said. 
  Indeed, experience bears out the view that the tighter the 
price controls, the smaller the size of foreign investment. In 
railway construction, foreign capital accounts for only five per 
cent or $2.3 billion of China's projected in vestment because of 
the rigid pricing structure. "Under the current price 
structure, foreign direct investment is limited, given the lack 
of market forces to determine prices," says the Peregrine survey. 
  As a result, the major source of funding for railway 
investment comes mainly from the Railway Construction Fund, 
launched in 1991. "If they actually press ahead with price 
reforms, I can see more foreign investors taking equity 
participation in several major national projects," said Mr Chan. 
  Although domestic financing is still the key source of 
funding for the construction of highways, foreign capital is 
playing a larger role, because road tolls are not as tightly 
controlled as railway fares and tolls vary from area to area. 
  Fund-raising for port development is easier than it is for 
railways and highways, again because of the flexibility given to 
enterprises to set charges. Several Hong Kong companies have 
gone into port development in a big way. Hutchison Whampoa has 
taken equity in ports in Shanghai, Yantian and Shanghai, Wharf 
Holdings in Wuhan, Swire Pacific and Peninsula &amp; Oriental in 
Shekou.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "China Races To Catch Up In Hi-Tech </F>
Circuit Production"] 
  [Text] China is determined to catch up with the world in 
the production of integrated circuits, the core of the modern 
electronics industry. 
  The Electronics Industry Ministry (MEI) describes China's 
integrated circuit sector as being about 15 years behind 
international standards. 
  Without effective measures, they warn, China will fall even 
further behind. 
  Last year, the country's 15 manufacturers produced 170 
million sets of integrated circuits, only 0.4 per cent of the 
world total. 
  Lacking capital investment, the industry has crawled along 
over the past decade, MEI officials said in a recent interview. 
  By contrast, the United States, Japan, Western Europe, South 
Korea and Taiwan have all injected billions of dollars into 
their industries. 
  Integrated circuits serve as the brain for most electronic 
projects. They are also the most difficult piece of electronics 
to manufacture. 
  In 1990, the government realized the strategic importance of 
integrated circuits and worked out an ambitious development 
programme. 
  The ministry hoped to invest 3 billion yuan ($345 million) 
to 
improve their technology and manufacturing capabilities. 
  However, government officials acknowledge that the programme 
has not gone smoothly. 
  Hi-tech equipment has been tough to import because of 
restrictions on the transfer of strategic Western technology 
imposed by the now-defunct Coordinating Committee on 
Multilateral Export Control. 
  The State has revised its strategy to rely more on producing 
integrated circuits domestically, officials said. 
  MEI will try to spur industry growth by 30 per cent annually 
in the coming years. Its target is to produce 1 billion 
integrated circuits by year 2000. 
  They noted that some factors favour the development of the 
industry. 
  Integrated circuit production will be stimulated by the 
ministry's intensified efforts to develop programme-controlled 
telephone exchanges, video cassette recorders, fax machines, 
copy machines and mobile telephones. 
  China is also proceeding with the three "Golden Projects" to 
form a national information network, which would create a 
massive market for integrated circuits. 
  China will need about 2 billion to 3 billion integrated 
circuits by 2000. 
  The ministry has set up 10 design and development centres 
and 
plans 30 to 40 more. 
  With the recent demise of the Coordinating Committee on 
Multilateral Export Control, importing technology and equipment 
will be easier, officials said. 
  In March, Huajing Electronics Company of Jiangsu Province 
signed a contract with American chipmaker Intel Corp to assemble 
386 microprocessors. 
  The ministry hopes in a few years to form some large 
companies each with annual production exceeding 100 million 
integrated circuits.

  [Text] Nanjing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- China's first 
provincial tax law -- the "Jiangsu Procedures for Implementing 
the `PRC Law for Tax Collection and Control'" -- has officially 
become effective. 
  Ever since their becoming effective, China's tax law and the 
detailed rules for implementating this law have been playing an 
important role in expediting the development of market economy 
in Jiangsu, in intensifying tax collection, in promoting tax 
management according to law, in tightening tax supervision, and 
in increasing revenues. Jiangsu's business taxes in 1993 
increased 54.4 percent over that of 1992, reaching 21.273 
billion yuan, accounting for more than 96 percent of the 
province's revenues in 1993. Taxes have become the province's 
main source of income. 
  Basing on the PRC tax law, the procedures drawn up for 
implementation in light of Jiangsu's actual situation have also 
assimiliated certain measures which Jiangsu has found effective 
for tax collection and control.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Huang Ju Speaks at the 12th Municipal </F>
Enlarged Executive Meeting; At the Meeting, He Emphasizes 
Tackling Economic Reform and Opening Up To Promote Economic 
Development and To Alleviate Problems and Enhance Social 
Stability"] 
  [Text] At the 12th municipal enlarged executive meeting 
held yesterday, Mayor Huang Ju emphatically stated that it is 
necessary to have a clear understanding of the situation, to 
work hard, to find the best balanced point in our efforts to 
achieve reform, development, and stability; and to strive to 
maintain good momentum for Shanghai's sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development. 
  The meeting reviewed and summed up Shanghai's economic 
development, reform, and opening in the first quarter and made 
plans for the work in the second quarter. Mayor Huang Ju made 
an important speech at the meeting. First of all, he affirmed 
various achievements accomplished by the city government during 
the first quarter. He said that Shanghai achieved marked 
results in seizing opportunities, deepening reform, opening up, 
promoting development, and maintaining a stable situation by 
carrying out the goals, principles, and tasks put forward by the 
second plenary session of the sixth municipal CPC committee and 
the second session of the tenth municipal people's congress. He 
said: Shanghai carried out various tasks this year under an 
unprecedented situation in which reform was extensively 
implemented, interests were widely readjusted, and new 
situations and problems continuously cropped up. Shanghai had a 
good start in carrying out this year's work because the city, 
under the leadership of the municipal CPC committee and 
government, wasted no time in unifying thinking, made good plans 
for the work of all fronts, and promoted a thorough work style. 
Shanghai continued to maintain a fairly rapid speed in 
developing the national economy. In the first quarter, it 
created 42.05 billion yuan of gross national product, an 
increase of 13.1 percent over the same period last year. Its 
total industrial output value reached 87.05 billion yuan, 
representing an increase of 13.9 percent over the same period 
last year. Its exports increased month by month, with an 
increase of 19.9 percent over the same period last year. Its 
economic efficiency increased simultaneously, with a fairly 
large increase in local revenues. Shanghai's economic structure 
improved. For the first time, the value added of its tertiary 
industry was higher than that of its secondary industry. Its new 
pillar industries enjoyed rapid growth. Its high-standard urban 
construction made good progress, with major projects including 
the inner traffic link, the overall renovation of People's 
Square, the First Line Subway, and the Tongfang Mingzhu 
Television Tower all proceeding smoothly. The 7-million-square 
meter housing project which is expected to be completed by the 
end of this year was in full swing. The work to remove houses 
from the area where the Chengdu Road Viaduct will be built was 
basically completed. In terms of utilizing foreign funds, 
Shanghai maintained fairly good momentum, with a marked increase 
in the use of foreign funds for industrial and new high 
technology projects. With the growth of Pudong district, the 
gross national product of this new district was 9 percent higher 
than that of the city itself. We achieved results in 
coordinating and promoting reform, development, and stability. 
A multilayer and multichannel poverty relief program was 
gradually institutionalized, thus laying a fine foundation for 
the stability of society. 
  Huang Ju emphatically said: While fully affirming the 
results, we should clearly recognize some new and outstanding 
contradictions existing in the city's economic life. We should 
also attain a complete understanding of some temporary 
difficulties cropping up in the course of our reform and opening 
drive. Faced with these new challenges, we should have a 
scientific attitude and the courage to overcome them. We should 
be good at exploring new methods. We should be persistent and 
move ahead so as to promote to a new height the city's work in 
all aspects. 
  While talking about the second quarter's work, Huang Ju 
said: 
The key to promoting the overall interests of reform, 
development, and stability as well as to carrying out the 
current work lies in two things: first, persisting in the 
promotion of reform, opening up, and economic development; and 
second, persisting in alleviating problems and enhancing social 
stability. He urged cadres at all levels to further emancipate 
the mind, seek truth from facts, correctly deal with the 
relations between reform, development, and stability, and strive 
to maintain a good economic growth rate by producing quality 
commodities which can find ready markets and by enhancing 
economic efficiency. We should take the overall situation into 
account and strengthen comprehensive coordination so as to 
fulfill all quotas for national economic and social development 
set for the first half of 1994. We should strive to fulfill the 
second quarter's work ahead of schedule and lay a solid 
foundation for realizing this year's goal. 
  Huang Ju put forward seven requirements for the second 
quarter's work as follows: First, it is necessary to treat 
marketing as a primary task in Shanghai's current economic work. 
We should seize the opportunities and actively expand the 
domestic market, in accordance with the requirement of promoting 
a socialist market economy and gearing our work toward the 
country as a whole. We should take active measures to readjust 
our marketing measures. Instead of waiting for customers to come 
to Shanghai, we should go out and set up shops across the 
country. Instead of doing business as a small merchant or 
peddler, we should engage in a large-scale goods trade. In this 
way, we can provide better service to the country as a whole, 
particularly to the hinterland and rural areas. Meanwhile, 
continued efforts should be made to expand foreign markets. We 
should spare no efforts in carrying out the "dragon head plan" 
for foreign trade. We should attach importance to 
foreign-funded enterprises and help them increase export 
earnings. We should tap and bring the role of village and town 
enterprises' potential into play. 
  Second, regarding the 
utilization of foreign investment, we should tackle thorny 
problems. We should show enthusiasm and initiative, compete for 
projects, and strive to locate a new breakthrough point through 
which we can open wider to the outside world. Third, we should 
earnestly intensify work to raise and distribute funds, improve 
our efficiency in utilizing funds, and ensure that we reach our 
goals for economic growth, particularly concerning progress in 
key projects. Fourth, on the one hand, we should focus on these 
three key supplementary points: key products and backbone 
industries which show prospects for development, village and 
town industries in rural areas, and joint investments by big 
state-owned enterprises; on the other, we should focus on 
helping some state-owned enterprises surmount difficulties, and 
strive to maintain the favorable trend for industrial 
development. Fifth, we should unswervingly, and actively but 
steadily, push forward the deepening of reform and open up wider 
to the outside world. We should experiment with the modern 
enterprise system and with innovations in the enterprise 
organization system, accelerate the construction of a modern 
market system, and conduct relevant studies and concentrate our 
energies on developing central commercial districts, on 
promoting joint investments by state-owned large backbone 
enterprises, and on supporting policy measures which promote 
"Chinese-Chinese-foreign" investment in village and town 
enterprises. We should also continue to expand our experiments 
on the shareholding system and actively develop the shareholding 
cooperative system. Sixth, we should galvanize the whole 
municipality into action and whip up an upsurge in turning our 
municipality into a national hygienic municipality. Our general 
objective is to basically build a national hygienic municipality 
this year and fully complete the relevant efforts next year. To 
achieve this, governments at all levels must list this as an 
important item on their agenda, which is a great undertaking 
with an impact on the image of Shanghai in reform and opening up 
and on the construction of a modern international metropolis, 
and a practical task which will effectively improve people's 
lives and work environment. We should implement the leadership 
responsibility system; set our sights on accomplishing our work 
in time for "May 1st," "July 1st," and National Day; and launch 
comprehensive activities to make improvements in a well-planned, 
systematic way, focusing on one aspect at a time. We should 
extensively mobilize the entire society to participate in and 
support our "construction" work so that the concept of "making 
Shanghai cleaner and prettier" takes root in the heart of people 
and becomes known to all. Seventh, we should seize the 
initiative to do work, provide prompt instructions, resolve 
conflicts, and maintain social stability. Right now, cadres at 
all levels, particularly principal leading cadres, should regard 
the effort to preserve social stability and ensure safety in all 
quarters as a major task. We should be adept at discerning 
public sentiments and at resolving conflicts promptly, further 
deepen campaigns to "show care," and conduct relevant efforts on 
a regular basis and systematically. We should also combine our 
efforts with ideological and political work and actually carry 
out work to overcome difficulties at various levels. 
  In summing up his speech, Huang Ju said emphatically: Cadres 
at all levels in the municipality must fulfill their duty and 
responsibility, judge the hour and size up the situation, work 
in full cooperation with unity of purpose, thoroughly plan their 
work, be single-minded, and ensure that the favorable trend in 
economic and social development is maintained in Shanghai. 
  Attending the meeting were vice mayors, and responsible 
persons from various committees, general offices, bureaus, and 
district and county governments. Vice Mayor Xie Lijuan made 
arrangements for the construction of a national hygienic 
municipality. Also invited to the meeting were responsible 
persons of the municipal people's congress, the municipal 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, and relevant authorities.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Under the Retirement 
Insurance Law issued in April, Shanghai's 4.01 million workers 
will enjoy an old-age pension as long as they have paid a 
premium for a long enough period. 
  Each of them has a fixed account recording how much premium 
he or she hands in, and each will keep the account for good, no 
matter whether he or she switches jobs, loses a job or moves to 
another locality. 
  The new system covers all staff in the city's 
administrations 
and enterprises, excluding foreign personnel in overseas-funded 
companies and some workers whose pensions are specially arranged 
by the government. 
  Shanghai, China's biggest metropolis with a population of 13 
million, has over two million people above the age of 60. 
  Mayor Huang Ju said that Shanghai aims to set up a 
scientific 
and socialized retirement insurance system. 
  In accordance with the new regulations, individuals should 
pay three per cent of their monthly salary as premium. The 
proportion will increase with the pace of growing incomes. 
  And the amount of old-age pension will depend on the sum of 
premiums paid by individuals and will be adjusted in line with 
the cost of living index. 
  People who work for private businesses can also benefit from 
the system.

<F P=106> ["Roundup: Performance of Shanghai's Economy Improves"] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Known as "China's 
economic barometer," Shanghai's economy continues to operate 
smoothly despite such adverse factors as raw materials price 
hikes, shortage of fund supply and sluggish market. 
  According to the municipal statistics bureau, Shanghai's 
gross domestic product (GDP) this year is expected to surpass 
the 13-percent increase of last year and reach the year's target. 
  Although industry, of which the output accounts for 60 
percent of the GDP, slipped early this year, it began to pick up 
in March, and jumped by 16 percent in April in comparison with 
the same period of last year. The ratio between sales volume 
and output reached 97.5 percent last month. 
  As a result of streamlining the foreign trade structure, 
improving the mechanism for encouraging exports and the 
municipal government's policy of promoting foreign trade, 
Shanghai exported a record 2.46 billion U.S. dollars-worth of 
goods in the first four months of this year, up 26.6 percent 
over the same period last year. 
  The city's improving investment conditions have aroused the 
interest of foreign business people, who set up 1,256 
foreign-funded projects with the approval of the municipal 
government in the January-April period. 
  These projects involved a combined investment of 2.89 
billion 
U.S. dollars, and some of them were funded by trans-national 
corporations. 
  However, a local official said there are still problems in 
the economy. 
  He analysed the situation as follows: "One third of 
state-owned enterprises suffer from losses which are caused by 
poor enterprise management, price hikes for raw materials and 
the unification of the dual exchange rate system. They result 
in a rise in production costs and hurt the enterprises badly." 
  Other factors include shortages of funds, inflation and 
sluggish markets. 
  The official noted that though Shanghai's inflation rate is 
lower than those of many other major cities in the country, it 
still affects the living standard of the lower-income people, 
retired people in particular. 
  However, experts here agree that Shanghai's economy is 
developing steadily thanks to the high input into the economy 
over the past few years, the increasing rationality of the 
economic structure, and the smooth reforms of the tax, banking 
and social security systems. 
  In line with the economic situation in the first four months 
of this year, the municipal government has decided to rearrange 
its credits and loans with the focus on supporting key 
enterprises, especially major foreign trade enterprises. 
  It urged industrial departments to take the marketing of 
industrial products as the most important task in order to boost 
production. 
  Meanwhile, related government departments have begun to help 
enterprises in the red to change their operational mechanism and 
make up deficits and increase surpluses in the process of market 
competition step by step. 
  In addition, the city is looking for a new way to make an 
overall opening to the outside world while continuously 
implementing the reform measures. 
  Economists believe that the municipal quota of a 12-percent 
growth in the economy and striving to attain 15 percent this 
year can be obtained on the condition that the macro-economic 
environment does not deteriorate.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Shanghai Becomes China's Major </F>
Nuclear Power Equipment Manufacturing Base"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 17 May (LIEN HO PAO)--The Shanghai power 
plant manufacturing industry, which provided the nuclear power 
equipment for the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant and the Daya Bay 
Nuclear Power Plant, recently signed a technical agreement to 
build two 600,000-kilowatt nuclear power plants for the Phase-2 
Qinshan project. It has also signed contracts to export a 
300,000-kilowatt nuclear power plant to Pakistan. Shanghai is 
becoming China's major nuclear power equipment manufacturing 
base. 
  In developing its nuclear power industry, Shanghai has 
invested nearly 200 million yuan and has built a number of 
fairly large nuclear power infrastructure projects. It has 
built factory buildings with a total floor space of 93,000 
square meters, including seven 100-400-tonne-class factory 
buildings. Since 1988, Shanghai has allocated over 3 million 
yuan in financial credits for tackling scientific and 
technological projects in nuclear power development. By the end 
of last year, it had defined 88 projects, of which 62 had passed 
appraisal tests. Meanwhile, the relevant ministries, 
commissions, and offices of the State Council have assigned to 
Shanghai 11 problems for the development of a 600,000-kilowatt 
nuclear power plant -- a key project to be tackled in the 
state's Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995). They have also 
allocated over 12 million yuan to improve Shanghai's ability to 
manufacture nuclear power equipment. 
  Shanghai has earmarked another 200 million-odd yuan in the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan for gradually developing Shanghai's 
production capability so that it can turn out between one and 
one and a half sets of nuclear power plant equipment annually 
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).

  [Text] Shanghai, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai's banking 
setup is developing in a healthy direction this year, according 
to Mao Yingliang, president of the Shanghai branch of the 
People's Bank of China. 
  The savings deposits in the various banks in this, China's 
largest economic center, increased by 22.63 billion yuan in the 
first four months of this year, an increase of 85 percent over 
the same period of last year. 
  Mao noted that Shanghai has made rational use of credits and 
loans to ensure the development of the key state capital 
projects and its new pillar industries, including motor 
vehicles, telecommunications, chemicals, machinery and 
electrical appliances, and the basic industries of power, 
textiles and steel products, as well as people's daily 
necessities. 
  The China foreign exchange center, which opened for service 
here April 4, has been linked up with 12 cities, and concluded 
transactions worth a total of three billion U.S. dollars and 
2.66 billion Hong Kong dollars so far. 
  The transactional volume of the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 
the first four months of this year amounted to 243 billion 
yuan-worth, up 58.8 percent over the same period of last year. 
  The interbank loans in Shanghai climbed to 56.24 billion 
yuan 
in the January-April period. 
  At present, the city has more than 90 foreign-funded banking

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "State Education Commission and </F>
Shanghai Municipal Government To Cooperate In Building Three Key 
Universities"] 
  [Text] According to a discussion meeting held in Shanghai 
yesterday afternoon by the State Education Commission and the 
Shanghai Municipal Government, after repeated consultations and 
discussions, the State Education Commission and the Shanghai 
Municipal Government signed a document yesterday according to 
which both sides have decided to cooperate in developing Fudan 
University, the Shanghai Communications University, and the 
Shanghai Foreign Language University. 
  After the meeting, Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai 
municipal party committee; Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju; and Chen 
Zhili, deputy secretary of the Shanghai municipal party 
committee, met with Zhu Kaixuan, minister of the State Education 
Commission, who had come to inspect work in Shanghai. Both Zhu 
Kaixuan and Shanghai Vice Mayor Xie Lijuan spoke at the meeting. 
  Of the nearly 50 universities and colleges in Shanghai, 28, 
or more than half of them, are under the jurisdiction of central 
departments or commissions. These universities and colleges have 
made important contributions to Shanghai's economic and social 
development. Of course, in the course of their development, 
these central-department- and commission-run universities and 
colleges have met with new problems. To explore new reform 
paths, gradually remove the barriers between different 
departments or regions, strengthen local governments' right to 
make overall plans for universities and colleges, and give 
stronger support to the development of universities and colleges 
under central departments or commissions, the State Education 
Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Government have decided, 
as a result of investigations and coordination over the past 
year, to make the three key national universities under the 
commission -- Fudan University, the Shanghai Communications 
University, and the Shanghai Foreign Language University -- 
pilot universities for conduction an experiment in "joint 
development." 
  The major features of "joint development" are: 
  After "joint development," the three universities will still 
be under the State Education Commission, but a dual leadership 
will be introduced for them. The original investment channel 
for the three universities will remain unchanged. The State 
Education Commission will continue to provide funds for 
administrative expenses and capital construction, including 
special appropriations and subsidies, to the three universities, 
and it will increase investment according to the ratio of 
ownership of the three universities. 
  Beginning this year following the signing of the contract, 
the Shanghai Municipal Finance Department will provide a sum of 
"joint development" subsidies to the three universities every 
year. In case the three universities want to hire highly 
trained professionals from other countries or from other parts 
of the country, relevant municipal government departments will 
give them the same treatment that they give other local 
universities and colleges in the following areas -- residence 
quotas, reductions and exemptions of urban development funds, 
and land requisition. 
  In accordance with the requirements for Shanghai's economic 
and social development and for reforming and developing the 
three universities, the Shanghai Municipal Government and the 
State Education Commission will decide some "joint development" 
projects for the three universities each year. For example, in 
the near future the municipal government will continue to help 
Fudan University to develop its department of postgraduate 
studies and establish a biology and medicine base; help the 
Shanghai Communications University to establish a 
Chinese-foreign joint venture facility for training high-quality 
managerial personnel; and help the Shanghai Foreign Language 
University to improve its management and to accelerate the 
training of foreign-language personnel. 
  The State Education Commission will support the three 
universities to gradually enroll more students from Shanghai and 
increase the proportion of graduates remaining in Shanghai to 
work. 
  The State Education Commission will support the three 
universities to take advantage of their trained personnel and 
science research facilities and to take part in developing 
Shanghai's new high-tech industries including automobile 
engineering, modern telecommunications, computers, and 
bioengineering. When drawing up or revising its economic and 
social development plan, Shanghai will include the development 
of the three universities in its general urban development 
program.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Non-state-owned 
technological enterprises, which adopt flexible measures to turn 
scientific findings into new products, have achieved an 
important status in Shanghai's science and technology sector. 
  The city's 5,644 such companies registered a sales value of 
8.7 billion yuan last year, compared with 900 million yuan 
earned by 2,000 firms in 1992. Local officials estimated that 
this year there will be over 6,000 non-state-owned technological 
firms with a turnover of 10 billion yuan. In 1997, the figure 
is expected to reach 20 million yuan. 
  Wang Huayu, a top official at the Municipal Science and 
Technology Commission, said that the city is to speed up the 
implementation of the share-holding system and absorb more 
foreign money to solve the problem of fund shortages. 
  Shanghai, China's biggest metropolis with a population of 13 
million, boasts 400,000 scientific and technological 
professionals. 
  Taking advantage of the abundant talent resources, the city 
has drawn up a series of preferential policies to encourage the 
development of non-governmental enterprises. 
  So far, these companies have employed more than 140,000 
people, and engage in the fields of computers, 
telecommunications, aviation and new materials. 
  Ten of them claim an annual output value of over 100 million 
yuan each, and another 150 make 10 million yuan annually. 
  This year the number of 100-million-yuan companies is 
expected to reach 20. 
  And the city's 700 private enterprises in the industry are 
also doing brisk business. 
  For example, the 34-member-strong Yangtian Group registered 
62.44 million yuan in turnover last year, ranking third among 
the city's nearly 6,000 firms. 
  The company's manager attributed its success to the sound 
work force as 90 percent of the workers are technicians and 
engineers. 
  In 1993 China had a total of 45,000 non-state-run 
technological firms, employing 400,000 people and creating 
annual profits of 50 billion yuan.

  [Text] On the morning of 16 May in Jinan, while meeting 
with members of the provincial team to report the deeds of the 
fourth term of the new Long-March shock workers, shock brigades, 
and pacesetters, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, encouraged the vast numbers of Communist Youth 
League [CYL] members and youths in the province to temper 
themselves and grow to maturity in the great practice of reform 
and opening up and to vie with one another in becoming socialist 
new-type persons being politically aware, morally-sound, 
well-educated, and disciplined. 
  Over the past several years, CYL organizations at all levels 
and the vast numbers of CYL members and youths in the province 
have taken an active part in the spring tide of reform and 
opening up, plunged into economic construction, strived to 
create a new civilized atmosphere, put all their energies into 
study with a view to becoming professional, and made great 
contributions to the province's socialist modernization cause. 
As a result, a large number of advanced and exemplary figures 
have come to the fore. 
  The provincial CYL committee decided to choose some 
representatives from the fourth term of the province's new 
Long-March shock workers, shock brigades, and pacesetters and 
organize them as a team to make a circuit of some colleges in 
the province to give reports on their advanced and model deeds. 
  When meeting with members of this team, Jiang Chunyun highly 
appraised the advanced deeds of the new Long-March shock workers 
and shock brigades. He said: You are advanced pacesetters of 
the youths in the province and representatives of shock workers. 
In you, we can see the image of the new-type persons being 
politically aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and 
disciplined, that was advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Your 
deeds have fully manifested the spiritual feature of the 
new-type persons, and thus you should be respected by the vast 
numbers of youths and by society as a whole. On behalf of the 
provincial party committee, I express my respect and extend 
congratulations to you. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Under the new situation of 
carrying out reform, opening to the outside world, and 
developing the socialist market economy, it is all the more 
important to carry forward the spirit of being politically 
aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and disciplined. As young 
people, we should be resolved to become professional and should 
have lofty ideals first. From a long-term point of view, the 
ideal of we communists is to realize communism. The fighting 
objective at the present age is to build China into a 
prosperous, strong, democratic, and civilized socialist country. 
Only with such a fighting objective, the ideal and faith will 
be provided with a spiritual pillar, and we will be able to work 
hard and forge ahead. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: Youths should embrace a correct outlook 
on life and a correct outlook on value and should make clear for 
whom they should serve and work. China is a socialist country 
led by the CPC. All citizens and all youths should embrace the 
outlook of value of selflessly serving the people and the 
motherland rather than being bent solely on profit. Our 
personal value cannot be realized unless we make contributions 
to the party and the state. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: Youths should improve their abilities 
and skills of making contributions to the party and the state. 
This is the only way to turn the strong desire of serving the 
people into reality and to yield the greatest results. 
  Jiang Chunyun expressed hope that the young people will 
carry 
forward the pioneering spirit of hardworking, truly carry out 
the 64-character pioneering spirit set forth by Comrade Jiang 
Zemin, and strive to become the youths who can accomplish 
something and who are needed by the party and the people. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: To become the new-type persons being 
politically aware, morally-sound, well-educated, and 
disciplined, we should, what is most important, strengthen 
study, particularly studying well Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building a socialism with Chinese characteristics, and should 
use this theory to arm our heads and improve our theoretical 
expertise so that we can stand high and see far. We should also 
study the basic knowledge on market economy and the knowledge on 
modern science. At the same time, we should be brave in 
practice and should strive to make innovations, absorb 
nutrition, and enrich and enhance ourselves in practice so that 
we can become people well trained in not only theory but also 
practice. 
  Jiang Chunyun fully affirmed the series activities launched 
by the provincial CYL committee on learning from advanced and 
exemplary figures and regarded the launching of these activities 
as a good method to educate and guide the vast numbers of 
youths. He called on CYL organizations to carry out the 
activities of learning from the advanced in a profound and 
sustained manner, and, through the advanced deeds of these 
exemplary youths, conduct a vivid, realistic, and convincing 
ideological education among the vast numbers of youths. He also 
encouraged the numerous youths in the province to make even 
greater contributions to the province's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive. 
  The reporting team, composed of (Liang Dong), (Li Jianmei), 
(Hou Chengjun), (Zhang Rong), (Hao Jianwei), will visit some 
colleges to give reports beginning on 17 May.

  [Text] Jinan, May 17 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shandong 
Province is forming an overall economic opening pattern. 
  Already, three economic and technology development zones and 
nine high-tech development parks, mainly in the east coast area 
and including Qingdao, Yantai and Weihai Cities, have appeared 
in an embryonic form. 
  The Qingdao Bonded Zone is in full operation. So far it has 
approved the establishment of 102 projects with funds from other 
parts of the country and overseas. These projects involve a 
total investment of 63 million U.S. dollars. 
  The Qingdao Shilaoren Tourism and Holiday Village has held 
talks on about 700 projects involving a total investment of 3.1 
billion yuan. 
  As the coastal areas are adjusting their foreign investment 
structure to attract international consortiums and corporations 
and compete in the world market, Shandong's central and western 
parts are taking advantage of their natural resources and 
abundant labor forces to absorb foreign investment to help boost 
their agriculture and rural industry. 
  The provincial government has granted export autonomy to all 
its cities and prefectures, and selected 25 counties with 
backward economies to try out a scheme of overall economic 
growth. 
  The province has established friendly relations with 52 
cities in 20 countries. 
  By the end of last year Shandong had approved the 
establishment of 13,000 foreign-funded enterprises with 
contractual investment totalling 12.45 billion U.S. dollars. 
  It exported 5.98 billion U.S. dollars-worth of goods last 
year, an increase of 27.1 percent over the previous year.

<F P=106> ["Provincial Party Committee and Government Make Plans for </F>
Maintaining Social Stability"] 
  [Excerpts] The provincial party committee and provincial 
government convened a meeting in Hangzhou yesterday for 
secretaries of prefectural and city party committees, city 
mayors, and prefectural administrative commissoners. In view of 
the major accidents and cases that have occurred in Zhejiang 
since the beginning of this year, the meeting will map out 
further plans for maintaining stability in the province. The 
meeting stressed: All localities and departments should remain 
sober, eliminate factors leading to instability, rectify 
enterprises and organizations with serious problems, strengthen 
management, and strengthen law enforcement so as to create a 
good environment for reform, opening to the outside world, and 
economic construction. Provincial Party Committee Secretary Le 
Zemin and Provincial Governor Wan Xueyuan spoke at the meeting. 
  The meeting noted: Since the beginning of this year, party 
committees and governments have conscientiously implemented the 
party Central Committee's principle on seizing opportunities, 
deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability; properly handled the 
relations among reform, development, and stability; and adopted 
measures to deal with the problems in connection with grain 
production, economic efficiency in enterprises, and vegetable 
supply. Satisfactory results have been achieved, and the 
general situation is good. While affirming these achievements, 
we should also be aware that problems still exist in social 
stability and public order. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting said: While focusing on economic construction, 
reform, and opening to the outside world, party committees and 
governments at all levels should also pay attention to social 
stability work. At present, they should concentrate on the 
following tasks. 
  First, strictly investigate and punish according to law 
those 
who are responsible for major accidents. [passage omitted] 
  Second, rectify enterprises and departments plagued by 
serious problems. Provincial and local authorities must rectify 
some key trades that are closely related to people's lives and 
property and are also plagued by many problems, in order to 
eliminate factors of instability and remove hidden troubles. 
[passage omitted] 
  Third, strengthen propaganda and education. In June, the 
province should launch propaganda activities focusing on safety 
education and social stability. Propaganda tools such as radio, 
television, and the press should be used to spread education on 
traffic safety, tourism safety, public order, professional 
ethics, laws, and regulations. [passage omitted] 
  Fourth, to comprehensively improve public order, it is 
necessary to mobilize all forces in society. [passage omitted] 
  Fifth, responsibility and tasks should be clearly divided 
among all organizations and departments. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] The Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee Discipline 
Inspection Committee began its second enlarged plenary meeting 
in Hangzhou today. Wang Qichao, member of the Standing 
Committee and secretary of the Discipline Inspection Committee 
of the provincial party committee, delivered a report entitled 
"Carry Out a Deep-Going, Sustained, and Even More Effective 
Anticorruption Struggle to Serve the Province's Reform, 
Development, and Stability." 
  Wang Qichao reviewed the unfolding of the anticorruption 
struggle and building of party work style and clean 
administration in the province since it implemented the 
guidelines of the second enlarged meeting of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission. He pointed out: The 
province's anticorruption work showed a good tendency and 
healthy progress, basically satisfying the central authorities 
and the provincial party committee's demands in the previous 
stage. 
  First, leading cadres' integrity and self-discipline were 
strengthened. Party and government leading bodies at or above 
county or department level generally held democratic meetings, 
during which 96 percent of the leading cadres carried out 
self-examination and self-correction with [words instinct] 
emotion. Most cadres conscientiously dealt with and corrected, 
in accordance with relevant provisions, mistakes exposed in 
their self-examination. For instance, 340 enterprise cadres 
with a second job had given up one of their jobs, 2,031 cadres 
turned in a total of 670,000 yuan in gift money and coupons they 
received and accepted during official activities, and 357 cadres 
returned credit cards they had kept for personal use. 
  Second, discipline inspection, supervision, and examination 
organs at all levels cracked a number of serious cases of law 
and discipline violation through concerted efforts. In the 
latter half of last year, discipline inspection and supervision 
organs received and handled 42,256 letters and visits from the 
masses, a 109.9-percent increase over the first half of the 
year; placed 1,988 discipline violation cases on file for 
investigation and corrective action, up 43 percent; and punished 
2,351 party-member cadres, up 88.7 percent. Of the cadres 
punished, 645 were expelled from the party or discharged from 
public employment, 79 were removed from official positions, and 
486 were placed on probation within the party. 
  Third, some progress was made in special rectification work, 
such as clearing up illegal fees, economic entities set up by 
party and government organs, overseas and out-of-country trips, 
and reckless distribution of gift money and coupons. The 
provincial government abolished 310 unreasonable fees in two 
batches, while relevant departments at the provincial level and 
various cities, prefectures, and counties scrapped 1,226 
self-imposed fees. 
  Wang Qichao pointed out: In carrying out anticorruption work 
this year, the province should take proper, unremitting charge 
of three tasks to strive for fresh results in the next stage: 
1. to further take good charge of leading cadres' integrity and 
self-discipline. While continuously implementing the five 
provisions put forward by the central authorities last year on 
leading cadres' integrity and self-discipline, we should 
earnestly enforce the five new provisions forwarded and 
reiterated by the central authorities this year; 2. to 
intensify efforts in handling cases and sternly punish corrupt 
elements; 3. to take good charge of special rectification work 
and the work to rectify unhealthy practices.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 17 (XINHUA) -- The risk management of 
assets has been introduced in all financial institutions in 
southern China's Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. 
  By the new system, the management of credit assets will be 
shifted from quantity control to qualitative control. 
  The Shenzhen branch of the People's Bank of China, as a 
management institution, will provide loans according to the 
assessment of a number of factors including assets sufficiency 
rate, the ratio between deposits and loans, fluidity of assets 
and structure of loans instead of controlling the total credit 
line alone. 
  Officials said that the reform, aiming to achieve standard, 
scientific and modern management in financial institutions, will 
help these institutions improve security, fluidity and 
efficiency of credit funds, thus establishing a flexible and 
secure monetary payment system. 
  Experiments in such system started in 1992. Now the system 
is being applied differently to financial institutions of 
different ownerships. For state-owned commercial banks, assets 
risk management is applied with credit put under compulsory 
quota management while for regional, joint stock commercial 
banks, the risk management is put under supervision, with the 
credit quotas as mandatory. Only non-banking financial 
institutions have instituted the standard risk management of 
assets, with no credit quotas imposed.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] The Shenzhen leadership has met unexpected 
resistance to its plans to rid all enterprises in the special 
economic zone [SEZ] of government control. The bold policy, 
originally scheduled to come into effect in July, meant that 
business units in the zone, including state-owned concerns, 
would no longer be the sub-ordinate adjuncts of government 
departments. 
  The reform was designed by the State Commission for the 
Reform of the Economic Structure as a way to help Shenzhen 
reclaim its status as the pace-setter for market reforms. After 
having been taken out of the control of government departments, 
the enterprises would become autonomous entities in keeping with 
international norms. 
  The Special Economic Zone leadership, however, has faced 
intense opposition from bureaucrats from both local and central 
government units. During recent meetings called by the 
municipal party and government leadership, the bureaucrats 
claimed that severing their links with the enterprises would 
lead to chaos and "misguided decisions". Municipal officials 
said privately, however, they expected the new measure to go 
through later this year. 
  Under the proposal, the "liberalised" enterprises would only 
be subjected to a "social supervision regime" that includes 
regular inspections by tax and auditing departments. "The 
original schedule is for the measure to be enacted into law by 
the Shenzhen legislature in the summer," a Shenzhen source said. 
"Bureaucrats who oppose the reform say their power and even 
rice bowl will be threatened if they can no longer exercise 
control over the enterprises." 
  Analysts said Mayor Li Youwei, who favours the reform, was 
up 
against a national wave of fiscal conservatism, which manifested 
itself in new calls for boosting Beijing's macro-level control 
over the economy. Under the existing system, state-owned 
enterprises and collectives are assigned as subordinate units to 
different ministries and bureaus, whose permission is necessary 
for activities ranging from production to sales. 
  If approved, the new system will also see a much lower level 
of authority and activities for Communist Party units in 
enterprises. It is understood Shenzhen has been lobbying Beijing 
for other autonomous powers, including the conversion of the 
entire zone into a bonded area and the limited circulation of 
Hong Kong and other currencies. 
  Shenzhen sources said its leaders hoped the local economy 
would be rendered "totally market-oriented" in 10 years in order 
to facilitate the economic integration between the SEZ and Hong 
Kong. The leaders told Beijing recently that Shenzhen was best 
equipped to lead the nation in experimenting with reforms.

and ammunition, including simulated guns; and the harboring of, 
and divulging secret information to a small number of criminals. 
  2. Those engaged in these activities must cease all their 
criminal activities from the date of the promulgation of this 
circular and willingly surrender themselves to local public 
security organs, relevant departments, or their work units; 
confess their crimes; and surrender all their firearms and 
ammunition so as to seek lenient treatment. 
  3. Those illegally possessing various kinds of military

charges of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition. 
  4. Various types of criminals using the guns mentioned above 
who surrender themselves between the date of the promulgation of 
this circular and 1 July 1994, and who perform meritorious 
services by informing against other offenders, will be punished 
leniently, given mitigated punishment, or excused from 
punishment according to law. Those in custody and criminals 
serving their sentences who willingly confess their crimes and 
render meritorious services by reporting and exposing criminal 
activities in which guns are used will be punished leniently or 
given mitigated punishment according to law. 
  5. Those who refuse to surrender themselves and confess 
their crimes, who destroy evidence, who spirit away their 
firearms and ammunition, who shield one another, who form pacts 
to shield one another, or who abscond so as to avoid punishment 
and refuse to be arrested, and who are brought to justice after 
the termination of the given time limit will be firmly and 
severely punished. 
  6. Those who know of criminal activities in which guns are 
used all have the duty to report and expose them to public 
security organs, judicial organs, or relevant departments. 
Those who have made contributions in informing against and 
helping the authorities capture criminals using guns will be 
rewarded on the merits of each case. 
  7. Those who intercede for and personally shield criminals 
using guns or who hide and destroy evidence and arrange and 
create false evidence for criminals will be severely punished. 
  8. Those who illegally carry firearms and ammunition, once 
discovered, will be subject to forceful measures and will be 
investigated and handled according to law. 
  9. Public security personnel discharging duties in 
accordance with this circular are entitled to shoot those who 
are committing a crime using guns and criminals armed with guns 
who are resisting arrest.

  Land supervision credentials are uniformly made by the State 
Land Administration Bureau and issued by the people's 
governments at the county level or above. 
  Chapter III -- The Jurisdiction, Filing, and Handling of 
Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law 
  Article 13. Cases involving violations of the land law refer 
to those that violate the land administration laws, rules, and 
regulations, the legal responsibility for which should be 
investigated and determined according to the law. 
  Article 14. The provincial land administration department is 
responsible for the province's land supervision work, and it 
administers the following cases in this administrative area: 
  1. Cases involving violations of the land law which go 
beyond city or county administrative area; 
  2. Cases involving violations of the land law which happen 
in this administrative area and have a major impact; 
  3. Cases involving violations of the land law which are 
commissioned by the provincial people's government or the State 
Land Administration Bureau. 
  Article 15. The city and county (district) land 
administration departments are responsible for the land 
supervision work in their administrative areas, and administer 
other cases involving violations of the land law not 
administered by the provincial land administration department. 
  Article 16. Township (town) people's governments are 
responsible for handling illegal occupations of land by 
residents in their administrative areas. 
  Article 17. A higher-level land administration department 
has the right to handle cases involving violations of the land 
law which come under the jurisdiction of a lower-level land 
administration department. It also can turn over to a 
lower-level land administrative department any cases involving 
violations of the land law which come under its jurisdiction so 
that these cases can be handled. 
  If a lower-level land administration department holds that a 
case under its jurisdiction involves violations of the land law 
which are so serious that the case should be administered by a 
higher-level land administration department, it may submit the 
case to a higher- level land administration department for 
handling. 
  Article 18. In accepting and hearing a case, it is necessary 
to fill in an "Application To Put on Record a Case Involving 
Violations of the Land Law." On approval, the case will be put 
on file for investigation and prosecution. 
  Conditions for accepting and hearing a case: 
  1. Have a definite actor; 
  2. Have facts on violations of the land administration laws, 
rules, and regulations; 
  3. A case that should be investigated and the responsibility 
determined according to the land administration laws, rules, and 
regulations; 
  4. A case over which the department has jurisdiction. 
  With regard to a major, complex case, it is necessary to 
send 
a duplicate copy to a higher-level land administration 
department for the record after the case has been put on file. 
  If, on examination, a case does not have the necessary 
conditions for being placed on file or does not come under the 
jurisdiction of this unit, it is necessary to inform the 
complainant in writing. 
  Article 19. After a case involving violations of the land 
law is placed on file, it is necessary to determine promptly no 
fewer than two handlers. For major, complex cases, a 
case-handling team may be set up. 
  If a case handler or relevant leader has conflicts of 
interest with the case or has other relationships with the 
interested parties and is likely to affect the fair handling of 
the case, he should avoid handling the case. 
  Whether a case handler or a relevant leader responsible for 
a 
case should avoid handling the case, it is for the relevant 
leader responsible for the case to determine the former, and for 
the higher-level land administration department or people's 
government at the same level to determine the latter. 
  Article 20. The land administration department should notify 
the actor within three days after the case is put on file, and 
the latter may express his view in writing within five days 
after receiving the notification. It will not affect the 
investigation and handling of the case if an actor does not 
express his view within the prescribed time. 
  Article 21. In handling a case involving violations of the 
land law, a handler should complete his work within 30 days 
after the case is put on file. If, owing to special 
circumstances, the case cannot be wound up as scheduled, with 
the approval of the relevant competent leader the deadline may 
be extended appropriately, but it should not be more than one 
month. 
  Article 22. If, through investigation, a case cannot be 
established as in violation of the law, it should be revoked. 
When a case is revoked, it is necessary to submit a report to 
the relevant leader for approval and to notify the actor and the 
complainant in writing. 
  Article 23. If a complainant considers it wrong not to put a 
case on file or to revoke a case, he may apply within five days 
pf receiving the notification to a higher-level land 
administration department for a re-examination. Within 30 days 
of receiving the application for re-examination, the 
higher-level land administration department should made a 
re-examination decision and pass the decision to the complainant 
and to the land administration department which had not put the 
case on file or had decided to revoke the case. 
  Article 24. If, through investigation, the land 
administration department establishes the existence of 
violations of the law, it should promptly issue a "Notice 
Calling For Discontinuation of Violations of the Land Law" to 
the interested party or parties. 
  Article 25. After ending its investigation and hearing, 
the case handler should submit a "Report on Investigating and 
Hearing Case Involving Violations of the Land Law" to the land 
administration department, which handles the case according to 
different circumstances: 
  1. If, after investigation, the violations of the land law 
are proven true and should be subject to disciplinary sanctions 
according to the law, the land administration department is to 
issue a "Written Ruling on Disciplinary Sanctions Against 
Violations of the Land Law"; 
  2. If a case is established as infringing on land 
proprietorship or use rights, the land administration department 
is to issue a "Written Ruling on the Handling of Land 
Infringement Conduct." The written ruling should be delivered 
to the interested party or parties. 
  Article 26. After completing the handling of a case, the 
case handler should fill in a "Report on Closing Case Involving 
Violations of the Land Law" which, on approval by the competent 
leader, should be catalogued with the documents, charts, and 
pictures collected in the course of handling the case, bound 
together, and placed on file. 
  After a major, complex case -- or one commissioned by the 
higher authorities -- is completed, it is necessary to submit 
the following documents to the higher-level land administration 
department for the record: 
  1. A "Written Ruling on Disciplinary Sanctions Against Cases 
Involving Violations of the Land Law"; 
  2. A "Written Ruling on the Handling of Land Infringement 
Conduct"; 
  3. A "Report on Closing Case Involving Violations of the 
Land Law." 
  With regard to a case reconsidered by an organ or heard by a 
people's court, it is necessary to attach the duplicate copy of 
the written ruling on reconsideration or the duplicate copy of 
the written ruling of the people's court. 
  Article 27. With regard to personnel who should be given 
disciplinary sanctions according to the law, the land 
administrative department is to make a recommendation on 
disciplinary sanctions to the unit in which he works or to the 
higher-level organ and the administrative and supervision organ. 
  A duplicate copy of the ruling on disciplinary sanctions 
made 
by the unit or the higher-level organ and the administrative 
supervision organ should be sent to the land administration 
department making the recommendation. 
  Article 28. In the course of handling a case involving 
violations of the land law, if the land administration 
department establishes that the violations constitute a crime, 
it should promptly turn over the case to a judicial organ for 
investigation and determination of criminal responsibility. 
  Article 29. If an interested party refuses to accept the 
disciplinary sanctions, he may apply for reconsideration to a 
higher-level land administration department within 15 days of 
receiving the "Written Ruling on Disciplinary Sanctions Against 
Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law." If the interested 
party refuses to accept the reconsidered ruling, he may file a 
suit with the people's court within 15 days of receiving the 
written ruling. He also may file a suit directly to the 
people's court within 15 days of receiving the "Written Ruling 
on Disciplinary Sanctions Against Cases Involving Violations of 
the Land Law." If, within the prescribed time, he neither 
applies for reconsideration, nor files a suit with the people's 
court, nor observes the sanctions, the land administration 
department, which takes the disciplinary sanctions, is to make 
an "Application for Forcible Implementation of Disciplinary 
Sanctions Against Cases Involving Violations of the Land Law" 
which, along with the copy of the case file, should be turned 
over to the people's court for forcible implementation. 
  Article 30. If the interested party refuses to accept the 
ruling on land infringement conduct, he may apply for 
reconsideration to an organ at a higher level than the one 
making the ruling within 15 days of receiving the "Written 
Ruling on the Handling of Land Infringement Conduct." If the 
interested party refuses to accept the reconsidered ruling, he 
may file a suit with a people's court within 15 days of 
receiving the written ruling. 
Chapter IV -- Rewards and Punishments 
  Article 31 Units or individuals conforming to one of the 
following conditions are to be commended or rewarded by the 
people's government or the land administration department: 
  1. Those scoring marked achievements in implementing land 
administration laws, rules, and regulations; 
  2. Those scoring marked achievements in developing, 
utilizing, and protecting land; 
  3. Those scoring outstanding achievements in land 
supervision work; 
  4. Those scoring marked achievements in informing against, 
exposing, and curbing violations of the land law. 
  Article 32. Land supervision personnel who, in the course of 
investigating and handling violations of the land law, practice 
favoritism or fraud in violation of the law, neglect duties, or 
abuse power, will be given disciplinary sanctions by the 
competent department. If this constitutes a crime, criminal 
responsibility will be investigated and determined according to 
the law. 
  Article 33. A person who refuses or obstructs land 
supervision personnel from executing their duties according to 
the law will be dealt with by the public security organ 
according to the provisions of the "PRC Security Administration 
Punishment Act." If this constitutes a crime, his criminal 
responsibility will be investigated and determined according to 
the law. 
Chapter V -- Supplementary Articles 
  Article 34. Explanation of these regulations lies with the 
Hainan Provincial Land Administration Bureau. 
  Article 35. These regulations come into effect on 
promulgation.

  [Text] Our province has put the prices of residents' basic 
daily necessities and services under overall control beginning 
early May. 
  In light of our province's actual conditions, in addition to 
the 20 items of goods and services whose prices and charges 
should be subject to overall price control as stipulated by the 
State Council, that is, wheat flour, polished long-grained 
nonglutinous rice, polished round-grained nonglutinous rice, 
edible plant oils, meat, eggs, milk, salt, sugar, soy sauce, 
detergents, coal for domestic use, liquefied petroleum gas, gas 
for domestic use, rents, running water charges, tuition fees and 
extras, child-care fees, medical care fees, and in-city public 
transport fares, the provincial government decided to put the 
prices of medicines under control. Price bureaus of various 
prefectures, autonomous prefectures, counties, and cities are 
encouraged to work out lists of additional specific items to be 
put under price control and report them to local governments for 
implementation. 
  Since the prices of our province's 21 items subject to price 
control have mostly been liberalized, to ensure the active 
control of commodity prices by means of price control, the 
provincial government has worked out specific stipulations on 
the division of authority over and measures for price control. 
It is learned that price control over the 21 items of 
residents' daily necessities and service charges has been 
carried out in different ways in accordance with the degree of 
impact on residents and the existing price management. These 
are mainly monitoring and guiding the trend of commodity prices 
by regulating the filing system, collecting information about 
commodity price changes and promulgating rules and regulations, 
providing information for macrodecisionmaking, introducing 
buying and selling price differential control and wholesale and 
retail price differential control to the circulation links of 
some commodities, and applying moderate administrative 
intervention in the behavior of increasing the prices of some 
commodities by introducing a report-for-approval system at the 
provincial and city levels or adopting interim price limiting 
measures. 
  The provincial government stressed: Price control should be 
carried out at the same time as the enterprises' decisionmaking 
power to set their own prices is respected. All producing and 
operating enterprises should properly handle the relationship 
between reform, development, and stability. In setting their 
prices, they should take it as a prerequisite to maintain market 
and social stability and rigorously standardize their own price 
readjusting behavior. At the same time, they have the duty to 
report readjustments of the prices of residents' basic daily 
necessities and service charges to their superior price 
departments for approval and recording in accordance with state 
stipulations. Subordinate governments also have the duty to 
report readjustments of the prices of basic daily necessities 
and service charges to their superior governments.

as well as various provincial department leaders. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie delivered at 
the meeting an important speech entitled: Correctly Handle 
Relations between Reform, Development, and Stability; Ensure 
Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy Economic Growth. 
  Secretary Xie Shijie's speech was divided into the following 
five parts: 
  1. Bearing in Mind the Overall Interests, View the Current 
Situation Correctly, and Resolutely Attain This Year's Work 
Goals; 
  2. Make Earnest Efforts To Tackle Current Economic Problems

  In his speech, Secretary Xie Shijie stated: The key to 
promoting the overall interests of the whole party and the whole

development, and stability. While development is the goal and 
reform the motive force, stability is the guarantee. Since the 
start of this year, the province has deepened reform; expanded 
opening up; and maintained sustained and rapid economic growth 
as well as basic social stability. The province's overall 
situation has remained fine to date. Nonetheless, we have also 
come across a host of problems and difficulties. 
  Secretary Xie Shijie called for paying more attention to 
some 
outstanding economic problems and grasping a number of current 
key work aspects. He said: First and foremost, we should try 
to stabilize grain output; readjust the agricultural structure; 
produce more model units good at increasing grain output and 
achieving a comparatively well-off livelihood; and push ahead 
with agricultural and rural economic growth; second, we should 
try to integrate reform with construction; energetically 
readjust the industrial structure, the product mix, and the 
enterprise structure; reduce losses sustained by enterprises; 
and raise industrial economic efficiency; third, we should make 
redoubled efforts to secure more foreign investments, develop 
export trade, and expand opening up to the outside world; 
fourth, we should strive to invigorate circulation, increase the 
effective supply of commodities, and place more commodity prices 
under market control; and fifth, we should strive to make every 
possible endeavor to make the best of the province's limited 
funds. 
  Secretary Xie Shijie stated emphatically: As public opinion 
has always had an important bearing on the overall interests of 
the party and the state, we should persistently maintain a 
correct public opinion orientation; implement correct public 
opinion principles and policies; bring into full play the role 
of the market; improve party leadership over public opinion; 
make public opinion serve and promote overall work and dispel 
pessimism; strictly distinguish between two different types of 
contradictions; and carry out political and ideological work of 
a mass character on a more extensive scale. 
  Secretary Xie Shijie called on party organizations at all 
levels across the province to further step up ideological 
building; arm all party members with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; build 
more competent leading bodies; become good at guiding economic 
as well as other types of work; energetically build grass-roots 
party organizations; further enhance the unifying force and 
combat effectiveness of each and every grass-roots party 
organization; carry on the current deep- going anticorruption 
struggle; vigorously improve party style and build clean 
government; go deep into reality to carry out investigation and 
study; cultivate a pragmatic work style; carry out down-to-earth 
work; work hard and live a plain life; and actively guide the 
broad masses of the people to participate in the socialist 
modernization drive.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 16 May (XINHUA) -- According to 
information gathered by this reporter from the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, Liu Bangyun, a worker at the Fangting Town Grain 
Shop in Shifang County, Sichuan Province, and Huang Kaihong, a 
former inmate in a reform-through-labor institution, used 
industrial alcohol to brew a toxic white spirit, which they sold 
for consumption, leaving four people dead and seven others 
seriously injured. Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong were sentenced 
to death after the Supreme People's Court verified the incidents 
and gave its approval; they were executed by shooting in Sichuan 
today. 
  In November 1991, Liu Bangyun, without applying for a 
business license, rented a distillery in Huaishu Village, Yunxi 
Town, Shifang County, illegally to brew and sell the white 
spirit for consumption. In August 1993, Liu Bangyun hired Huang 
Kaihong, who had been released from a reform-through-labor 
institution, to promote sales. To seek staggering profits, Liu 
Bangyun and Huang Kaihong hatched the scheme to lace the white 
spirit with industrial alcohol. From 17-30 September 1993, they 
bought 3.8 tonnes of industrial alcohol through fraudulent means 
on four occasions, and mixed it with water to produce some 20 
tonnes of the white spirit in bulk, which they sold in Shifang 
and Guanghan Counties. At the distillery, they also retailed 
the spirit to people in nearby villages. 
  On 9 October 1993, Ye Shaofu and Ye Shaorong, two brothers 
in 
Huaishu Village where the distillery is located, bought 28 jin 
of the white spirit in bulk from the distillery for a funeral 
dinner in memory of their late father. Many guests at the 
dinner suffered from methanol poisoning after drinking the 
spirit. Although they were given emergency treatment in a 
hospital, Ye Shaofu, Ye Shaorong, and several people who 
suffered from poisoning sustained severe eye damage and lost 
their sight as a result. At midday on 12 October 1993, Chen 
Zhonghui, a woman in Qingming Village, Yunxi Town, entertained 
guests at her home. In all, she drank about three liang of the 
spirit, during the day and at night. After the drinks, her 
vision turned blurry, and she was too weak to walk. She died on 
that night. During the 10-day period from 4-14 Ocotber 1993, 11 
cases of alcohol poisoning were reported one after another in 
Yunxi Town and Minzhu Township in Shifang County, leaving four 
people dead, seven seriously harmed, and three with minor 
injuries. An investigation confirmed that the white spirit 
consumed in all 11 cases was brewed by Liu Bangyun and Huang 
Kaihong. Following an autopsy of the dead, and testing of the 
poisonous substance and samples of the spirit, relevant 
departments found that the white spirit, brewed by Liu Bangyun 
and Huang Kaihong through mixing with industrial alcohol, 
contained methanol whose minimum and maximum contents were 229 
and 330 times higher than those set by the state for health 
reasons. Just drinking a small amount could leave people blind 
in both eyes or dead. After the incidents, more than 10,000 jin 
of the toxic spirit, which had not yet been marketed, and which 
had methanol contents more than 250 times higher than those set 
by the state, was found at Liu Bangyun's distillery. 
  By wantonly using industrial alcohol to brew the harmful 
white spirit for sale, Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong seriously 
endangered society and people's lives. Ruling in accordance 
with the Criminal Law and relevant decisions of the National 
People's Congress Standing Committee, the Deyang City 
Intermediate Court convicted Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong on 
charges of brewing and selling toxic and harmful foods. Because 
the circumstances of the crime and the consequences of the harm 
inflicted on people were both exceptionally serious, the court 
sentenced Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong to death in accordance 
with the law, deprived them of their political rights for life, 
and fined Liu Bangyun 3,300 yuan. Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong 
disagreed with the ruling and filed an appeal. During 
second-instance proceedings, the Sichuan Provincial Higher 
People's Court rejected the appeal and upheld the original 
verdict. 
  A responsible person from the Supreme People's Court pointed 
out: Criminal activities in producing and selling counterfeit 
and substandard goods, especially toxic and harmful foods, 
directly endanger people's lives and safety. People's courts 
should continue to mete out stiff punishment for such criminal 
activities in accordance with the law.

  [Text] Lhasa, May 18 (XINHUA) -- The goal of the central 
government's substantial investment in the Tibet autonomous 
region over the past 40 years has been to lay a solid economic 
foundation and accumulate more strength for Tibet's future 
development, a senior Tibetan official said here today. 
  In an exclusive interview with XINHUA, Gyaincain Norbu, 
chairman of the regional people's government, said the state 
financial input is aimed at developing land resources instead of 
merely providing financial assistance to an underdeveloped area. 
  He admitted that Tibet is the most economically 
underdeveloped region in China. However, he said, the central 
government and people all across the country have shown special 
concern and support for Tibet. 
  The central government has stipulated a series of 
preferential policies towards Tibet and earmarked an enormous 
amount of money to help Tibet step up its economic development. 
  In return, people of various nationalities in Tibet have 
also 
made great contributions toward safeguarding and building up 
this remote southwestern part of the country. 
  According to Gyaincain Norbu, who was elected chairman in 
1990, the central government has invested some 20 billion yuan 
(2.3 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet over the past 40 years. 
This has helped the region achieve sustained economic growth, 
national unity, and social progress. 
  In 1993, Tibet produced 3.65 billion yuan (400 million U.S. 
dollars) in GNP, an increase of 8.1 percent over the previous 
year. The region registered fast development in agriculture, 
animal husbandry, industry, infrastructure construction and 
foreign trade. 
  Gyaincain Norbu has stressed the importance of reform and 
social stability. "Tibet has no way out without further reforms 
or establishment of a socialist market economy," he said, adding 
that this is the key topic at the current session of the 
regional people's congress. 
  He said Tibet's development depends on agriculture and 
animal 
husbandry, and the broad efforts of farmers and herdsmen. Only 
by developing these sectors and increasing the income of farmers 
and herdsmen, which make up 80 percent of Tibet's population, 
can reform, development and stability be guaranteed. 
  The regional government will carry out the contract 
responsibility system, which enables farmers to make their own 
decisions in farm production and develop a diversified economy 
as well as township industries. 
  Over the past few years, Tibet has invested over one billion 
yuan (110 million U.S. dollars) to carry out comprehensive 
agriculture development projects in the region's major valleys, 
such as the Yarlung Zangbo, Lhasa and Nianchu river valleys so 
as to build these areas into the region's bread baskets. 
  The regional people's government has also planned a number 
of 
new construction projects, among which infrastructure will be 
the top priority. Hydroelectricity is the region's major power 
source and it has great potential for geothermal, solar and wind 
power development. Tibet is busy building such key construction 
projects as the Yamzhog Yumco power station and is renovating 
highways from Qinghai to Tibet and from Sichuan to Tibet, as 
well as the Bangda airport, he said.

  [Text] Lhasa, May 17 (CNS) -- Chairman of the Tibet 
Autonomous Region Mr. Gyaincain Norbu disclosed at the second 
session of the 6th Autonomous Region's People' Congress that the 
Region planned to have its Gross National Product reach RMB 4.01 
billion [renminbi] this year and to maintain 8 percent economic 
growth. 
  With the deepening of reform and opening to the outside 
world 
there, the region's economy has showed fast development in 
recent years with the GNP of the region last year increasing by 
8.1 percent than that of the year before. To achieve the goal 
of continuous, rapid and healthy development set for this year's 
economic sector, Mr. Gyaincain Norbu called for authorities at 
various levels of the region to put their emphases on the 
following economic works: 
  The increase in income of farmers and herdsmen should be 
taken as the core of the work, and economic development in 
farming and pastoral areas should speed up. Investment in 
farming and animal husbandry would be increased with production 
funds offered by the regional government this year expected to 
increase by 13.7 percent over last year's budget. The 
developing programs such as "one river, two tributaries" have 
had funds of RMB 120 million in place. Township enterprises and 
diversified businesses there should be also greatly developed. 
  Various kinds of enterprises should enhance their beneficial 
results to realize increase of production, marketing and profits 
at the same pace based on market. Natural resources there as 
well as animal husbandry products, forest products and mineral 
products should be fully exploited. 
  Foreign trade and tourism in the region should also be 
further developed with exports expanded and border trade boosted. 
  Market construction should be speeded up to cultivate 
unified 
and open market system. Primary commodity fairs in counties and 
towns and a financial market with bank funding as its core 
should be greatly developed. So should be with individually- 
and privately-owned economy. [sentence as received]

  [Text] Hangzhou, 17 May (XINHUA) -- Wang Daohan, chairman 
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
[ARATS], told a XINHUA reporter today: Under the new situation 
of deepened reform and widened opening up on the mainland, 
cross-strait economic and trade exchanges have developed 
rapidly. In addition, visits by personnel and other kinds of 
exchanges have continued to increase. In the favorable situation 
of the further development in cross- strait relations, there 
unfortunately occurred the malignant criminal case of robbery, 
arson, and murder at Qiandao Lake at the end of March which 
killed 32 compatriots from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
I express my profound condolences to the murdered compatriots 
and my deep sympathy to their family members. 
  Wang Daohan said: Leaders of the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council attached great importance to the "Qiandao Lake 
case" after it happened, and the relevant Zhejiang authorities 
put in full efforts with an earnest and responsible attitude to 
crack the case. The criminals have now been arrested, and the 
judicial department will severely punish them in accordance with 
the law. Meanwhile, the relevant mainland authorities have 
properly dealt with the aftermath of the incident, taking into 
consideration the overall situation of safeguarding the 
development of cross-strait relations. The relevant mainland 
experts gave a detailed account to personnel of the Strait 
Exchange Foundation [SEF] and relevant Taiwan experts on how the 
case occurred and was cracked. In addition, they answered 
various doubts of the Taiwan side about the case and also 
arranged for Taiwan experts to visit the scene. This has 
demonstrated the mainland's sincerity in making the greatest 
efforts to explain the truth of the case to the Taiwan side. 
  Wang Daohan said: After the case occurred, compatriots from 
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait shared the same sorrows and 
regrets, and Taiwan circles have also put forward many opinions 
and suggestions. We feel that in the powerful tide of thriving 
cross- strait exchanges and unstoppable economic cooperation, 
the "Qiandao Lake incident" was only an unexpected and 
unfortunate case of murder and that it should not affect the 
normal development of cross-strait relations. Furthermore, it 
should not be used by a small number of people with ulterior 
motives as an excuse to oppose the mainland, block cross-strait 
exchanges, and advocate Taiwan independence. The two sides of 
the Taiwan Strait should value the overall interests of the 
Chinese people and rationally, calmly, and objectively treat the 
case and various problems arising from it in the course of 
handling the incident, as well as earnestly draw a lesson from 
it. The mainland side will continue to tighten security 
controls to ensure the security of Taiwan compatriots who visit 
the mainland. 
  Wang Daohan said: The successful convening of the Wang-Gu 
[Wang Daohan-Koo Chen-fu] talks one year ago has played an 
active role in promoting the development of cross-strait 
relations. In accordance with the agreements signed at the 
talks, the ARATS and SEF have established a systematic 
communications channel which has played an important role in 
enhancing understanding and mutual trust as well as in 
minimizing differences. With the continued development of 
cross-strait relations, it should be said that there are bright 
prospects for ARATS-SEF cooperation, and compatriots from the 
two sides of the Taiwan Strait are placing high hopes on the 
ARATS and the SEF. The two sides should further strengthen 
their communications channel, particularly in strengthening 
high-level contacts, increasing dialogue, eliminating 
misunderstandings, resolving differences, and promoting 
cooperation. Only with this can we comply with the wish of 
compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and shoulder 
the heavy responsibility entrusted by history.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 17 (XINHUA) -- The Qiandao incident, 
involving the murder of 32 people from Taiwan and the mainland, 
should not adversely affect the normal development of relations 
across the Taiwan Straits, a senior official said here today. 
  The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang 
Province on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat 
and the robbery and murder of 32 victims. Of the dead, 24 were 
tourists from Taiwan. 
  Wang, chairman of the mainland's Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that the incident should 
not be used by a few people with ulterior motives as an excuse 
to oppose the mainland, halt exchanges across the Taiwan Straits 
and advocate Taiwan "independence". 
  "Both sides of the Taiwan Straits should view, with a good 
sense and in a calm and objective manner, the incident and 
various questions arising in the course of handling the 
incident, as well as draw a lesson from it," he said. 
  He promised that the mainland will continue to tighten 
security administration in an effort to ensure the security of 
Taiwan compatriots in their visits to the mainland. 
  Wang, who is inspecting Zhejiang Province, said that the 
incident was an unexpected, unfortunate tragedy in the course of 
expanding across-straits exchanges and economic cooperation. 
  He expressed the hope that ARATS and its Taiwan counterpart, 
the Straits Exchange Foundation, will try to increase contacts 
and dialogue at high level, eliminate misunderstandings, resolve 
differences and promote cooperation.

case will be handed over to the Hangzhou Intermediate People's 
Court after the investigations. 
  The mainland legal experts had made detailed explanations to 
SEF officials and relatives of the Taiwan victims on the case 
and on how the case was disclosed by the Hangzhou Public 
Security Bureau when they first arrived in Hangzhou, capital of 
the province. 
  He Ting, a legal expert from the criminal case investigation 
bureau under the Ministry of Public Security, said that mainland 
legal experts had spent half a day briefing the visitors on the 
case and the investigations. A 40-minute video program and more 
than 100 slides were shown during the briefing. 
  Later, the SEF officials and the experts invited by SEF were 
led to the burnt boat "Hairui" on Qiandao Lake in Chunan County. 
They carefully examined the boat and also took a look at the 
tools of crime and the snatched goods and money as well as the 
region of water where the crime took place. 
  He noted that detailed briefings have been made to the SEF 
officials and the Taiwan experts while the procuratorial 
department is still making investigations into the case and the 
case is yet to be tried by the court. 
  Mainland legal experts said that they believe the SEF 
officials and Taiwan experts should be satisfied if they start 
from the viewpoint of seeking the truth of the case, because 
they now know what they wanted to know and have seen what wanted 
to see. 
  They added, however, that if the SEF officials and Taiwan 
experts still show doubts about the tools of crime and the 
booty, or still deny the conclusion the mainland legal 
departments made through profound investigations, then they are 
not seeking the truth in a scientific way. 
  The mainland legal experts said that they have noted that 
there were quite a few guesses, presumptions or even rumors 
being spread outside China when the case was being investigated. 
  They said it is understandable that some people had doubts 
and misunderstandings on some issues at that time and it is 
reasonable that the SEF officials and Taiwan experts may have 
reached different conclusions on some minor issues of the case 
now, and thus are raising questions on them. 
  But it will be a vain effort to place obstacles to the 
development of relations across the Taiwan Straits through 
"politicizing" the boat fire case or fueling "doubts" by 
misusing the mainland's sincerity or the materials and details 
of the case offered by the mainland, since the facts are now 
very clear and evidence conclusive, mainland legal experts 
stressed. 
  The mission of the SEF representatives is thus over, and 
they 
are expected to leave Hangzhou by plane tomorrow to return to 
Taibei [Taipei] via Hong Kong.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The group of the 
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) led by its Deputy 
Secretary-General Hsu Hui-yu today went on an inspection sail 
along the route of the "Hairui" boat on Qiandao Lake in Chunan 
County, Zhejiang Province. 
  In the company of the legal experts invited by the 
Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the 
SEF group sailed from Xiyuan port at eight o'clock in the 
morning to Shedao Island, the last sightseeing stop for the 32 
victims from Taiwan and the mainland in the boat robbery and 
murder on March 31. 
  Then the group sailed into the Huangniling waters where the 
32 tourists were robbed and burned to death in a closed lower 
cabin of the "Hairui". 
  In the afternoon, the group left the port of Xinanjiang 
power 
station for Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province.

  [Text] Geneva, May 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan hopes to become a 
founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Taiwan's 
Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said here Tuesday 
[17 May]. 
  "So we hope we can be admitted to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) by the end of this year," Sheu stressed 
at the opening session of the fifth meeting of the GATT working 
party screening Taiwan's membership application. 
  The Geneva-based world trade regulatory body is scheduled to 
be superceded by the WTO early next year. 
  In preparation for joining GATT, Sheu said, Taiwan is ready 
to open its merchandise and service markets. "We are also 
determined to abide by the GATT-initiated trips (trade 
related-aspects of intellectual property rights) regulations," 
he added. 
  Sheu continued that Taiwan has adjusted its trade regime to 
meet GATT requirements. In addition to slashing tariff rates 
for a number of industrial and agricultural products, Taiwan 
will also gradually open its telecommunications, tourism, 
construction and financial markets to foreign companies. "We'll 
also revise our copyrights, trademark and patent laws to comply 
with trips provisions," Sheu said. 
  He further promised that Taiwan will begin consultations 
with 
GATT contracting parties on the signing of agreements on 
government procurement soon after it joins the organization. 
  By signing such accords, Taiwan will allow foreign companies 
to bid for its public construction and government procurement 
projects, valued at more than US$20 billion annually. 
  Taiwan originally planned to sign such accords one year 
after 
its accession to GATT. Pressured by many GATT members, Taiwan 
has decided to start such negotiations upon its entry, but it 
will follow the South Korean example requiring those accords not 
to take effect until 1997. 
  Sheu also presented a written statement detailing Taiwan's 
plan to overhaul its decades-old wine and tobacco monopoly 
system in accordance with GATT requirements. 
  Sheu asked GATT contracting parties to submit lists of 
products for which they want Taiwan to cut tariffs and lists of 
services they hope Taiwan will open to foreign investment before 
the end of July to speed up Taiwan's GATT entry. 
  Sheu said Taiwan hopes to begin discussion on the protocol 
defining Taiwan's GATT accession in the next meeting of the 
working party. "We hope the sixth meeting of the working party 
can be held in late July," he added. 
  In a meeting with GATT Deputy Director-General Warren 
Lavorel, sheu said GATT should give Taiwan a 10-year adjustment 
period before it fully opens its rice market now that South 
Korea, a GATT member, has that grace period. 
  Sheu is heading a 33-member delegation to the fifth 
multilateral meeting on Taiwan's GATT bid, which will last 
through Thursday. 
  In addition to multilateral discussions, the Taiwan 
delegation will also hold formal or informal bilateral tariff 
concession talks with several GATT members, including Japan, the 
European Union, Switzerland, Colombia, Mexico and South Korea, 
during its stay here.

  [Text] Concerning the U.S. State Department's reiteration 
of its one China policy, Presidential Office Spokesman Tai 
Jui-ming pointed out that one China is an unrealized goal 
pursued by our country. China currently consists of two 
political entities. The Republic of China is a sovereign 
country in Taiwan and on Penghu [Pescadores], Chinmen [Quemoy] 
and Matsu islands. There is no question at all on this issue. 
The two sides of the Taiwan Strait are being governed 
separately. The Republic of China and the People's Republic of 
China [zhong hua ren min gong he guo 0022 5478 0086 3046 0364 
0735 0948] are not under the jurisdiction of each other's rule. 
Therefore, when we talk about a unified China, we must not 
forget that a unified China is a goal which is not yet realized. 
It is hoped that the U.S. State Department's policy of 
advocating one China is also a goal. It is hoped that all 
countries in the world will look squarely at this fact.

  [Text] Taipei, May 17 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
will not voluntarily sever diplomatic relations with South 
Africa even if Pretoria decides to establish formal ties with 
Beijing, Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Chien made the remarks when he was asked during an 
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan on how well the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for South Africa's 
possible diplomatic switch from Taipei to Beijing, an "old 
friend" in South African President Nelson Mandela's terms. 
  He said Pretoria may choose to recognize both Taipei and 
Beijing, which would benefit Taipei because other countries 
might then be prompted to follow suit. And such a policy on the 
part of South Africa would not mean Taiwan has abandoned its 
"one-China" policy, he asserted. 
  But he added that Taiwan has "no right to snoop into South 
Africa's external relations," saying it was up to Pretoria to 
decide with whom to make friends.

  [Text] On the question of our country's diplomatic 
relations with the Republic of South Africa [RSA], Foreign 
Minister Chien Fu yesterday [17 May] said at the Legislative 
Yuan that, after President Li's visit to South Africa, it has 
been proven that bilateral relations between our country and 
South Africa are very solid. He said that, in the future, our 
country would not interfere with South African Government's 
selection of friends. Our country would not voluntarily sever 
diplomatic relations if South Africa establishes diplomatic 
relations with Communist China. Even if it creates the issue of 
dual recognition, it would benefit our side because other 
countries might then be prompted to follow suit. 
  Minister Chien Fu said: [Begin recording] Are we going to 
sever relations with South Africa if South Africa wants to 
establish diplomatic relations with Communist China but 
continues to maintain diplomatic relations with us and does not 
sever relations with us? Concerning this question, I wish to 
provide an explanation. The foreign relations of the Republic 
of China are always based on one principle -- that is, we 
sincerely want to establish relations with all peace-loving 
countries in the world. What is important to us is our 
relations with individual countries. As to the handling of 
other diplomatic affairs by those countries, they are within the 
sovereign rights of that country and we cannot interfere with 
the diplomatic affairs of that country. Therefore, we attach 
importance to South Africa specifically in terms of our 
bilateral diplomatic relations with that country. We should not 
interfere with South Africa's choice of friends in its foreign 
affairs. We will definitely not sever diplomatic relations with 
South Africa if it establishes diplomatic relations with a 
certain regime or country. [end recording] 
  The above remarks were made by Minister Chien Fu when 
answering interpellations at the Legislative Yuan.

  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- Foreign Minister Fredrick 
F. Chien said Monday [16 May] that President Li's 13-day, 
four-nation visit has contributed greatly to the strengthening 
of Taiwan's relationships with both friendly countries and those 
countries with which it does not maintain formal diplomatic ties. 
  Chien, who was a member of President Li's entourage during 
the overseas trip, made the remarks at a press conference. 
  President Li returned home Monday afternoon after visiting 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa and Swaziland. 
  Chien said that Li had met with around 30 heads of state 
during his stay in South Africa. 
  He said he would like to use the Chinese proverb, "I will do 
what I should do no matter how difficult it is," to describe 
what Li had done and his dedication in expanding Taiwan's 
diplomatic arena. 
  Chien, however, denied news reports that Li met with 
Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong during his stopover at 
Singapore's Chang Kai-shek International Airport on Monday 
morning. 
  He said Li only had a 30-minute meeting with Ker Sin Tze 
[name and title as received], Singapore's state minister for 
information, arts, and education.

  [Text] Geneva, May 16 (CNA) -- The first bilateral tariff 
consultations between Taiwan and Canada under the framework of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ended here Monday [16 
May] in a friendly atmosphere. 
  Director General Huang Yen-chao of Taiwan's Board of Foreign 
Trade, who led the Taiwan delegation to the tariff talks, said 
that during the one-day meeting, the Canadian side again stated 
its support for Taiwan's bid to join GATT. 
  The Canadian delegation was headed by Paul Haddow, a 
division 
chief in charge of tariffs and market access under the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 
  Canada is prepared to give a detailed reply to Taiwan's 
tariff proposals before the end of June and to hold another 
round of negotiations with Taiwan at any time, Huang said. 
  Taiwan proposed to maintain current import duties on certain 
products, and to lower tariffs on some others all at once or in 
batches following its entry into the Geneva-based world trade 
regulating body, he elaborated. 
  During the talks, he pointed out, both sides focused on 
tariff reductions of 837 agricultural and industrial items, 
non-tariff barriers, government procurement, and trade in civil 
aircraft. 
  The Canadian delegation said that the first round of 
consultations will have a positive effect on subsequent talks 
and that Taiwan's plan to begin bilateral discussions on the 
government procurement agreement immediately after its accession 
to GATT is encouraging, Huang reported. 
  Canadian delegates, however, expressed deep concern about 
some of Taiwan's price and quantity-based taxation systems as 
well as protective measures for agricultural products, he added. 
  While Canada asked Taiwan to slash tariffs in line with its 
application as a developed contracting party, Huang said he told 
the Canadian delegation that Taiwan's import duties on 
industrial goods are relatively low and that Taiwan remains a 
developing country in its agricultural sector. 
  The two sides agreed to add service industries to the next 
round of bilateral consultations, Huang noted. In addition, he 
said, Canada showed keen interest in exploring Taiwan's 
telecommunications market. 
  Huang is among a 33-member Taiwan mission here for the fifth 
meeting of the GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership 
application, which will open Tuesday and go through Thursday. 
Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng is leading the 
mission. 
  Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and 
is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 18 (CNA) -- Taiwan has not violated any 
international ban on exports of whale meat, a Council of 
Agriculture (COA) official said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  The COA issued eight permits to export 321 tons of old 
frozen 
whale meat between 1988 and 1993, said Li Jen-chuan, director of 
the COA's Fishery Department. "The meat had been stockpiled 
before Taiwan formally banned commercial whaling in 1981," Li 
explained. The International Whale Commission did not formally 
ban commercial whaling until 1985. 
  Taiwan decided to allow exports of such meat only after it 
could not obtain assistance from the United States and Japan for 
handling the meat, Li noted. Taiwan originally had 450 tons of 
whale meat in its stockpile, but 129 tons of the meat rotted 
while in storage. Local dealers managed to sell the remaining 
meat by October 1993. The last batch, weighing 220 tons, was 
exported to Singapore. 
  Li said the 232 metric tons of whale meat the U.S.-based 
Animal Welfare Institute claimed it had found in the Russian 
port of Vladivostok was not necessarily from Taiwan. "If the 
meat was old and frozen, it might have been transshipped to 
Russia by the Singaporean company which first bought the meat 
from Taiwan," Li said, adding that no international trade rules 
can prevent such transshipment. If the meat was fresh, Li said, 
it might be Singaporean traders who used the Taiwan-issued 
export permit for old frozen whale meat to ship the fresh meat 
to Russia. "We hope the American conservation group can further 
investigate the case before blaming Taiwan," Li said. "It's 
unfair to fault US for failing to prevent whale meat smuggling," 
he added. 
  Li made the statement after the U.S. group, in a Tuesday 
news 
conference in Washington, D.C., accused Taiwan of being involved 
in a smuggling operation orchestrated by Japan's largest whale 
meat distributor.

  [Text] Taipei, May 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan has consistently 
enjoyed a surplus in its farm trade with Japan in recent years, 
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics 
(DGBAS) reported Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Taiwan registered a surplus of US$2.47 billion in its farm 
trade with Japan last year, up 14.9 percent from that recorded 
in 1987, the cabinet-level agency said. 
  Taiwan's agricultural exports to Japan grew at an average of 
1.6 percent annually between 1987 and 1993, with the amount 
rising from US$2.49 billion to US$2.74 billion, according to 
DGBAS statistics. 
  Farm imports from Japan, however, declined 18 percent during 
the seven-year period to US$270 million for 1993, the 
directorate said. 
  While two-way trade between Taiwan and Japan has continued 
expanding, the share of agricultural products in total bilateral 
trade has declined steadily, DGBAS officials said. 
  Farm goods accounted for 30.6 percent of Taiwan's total 
exports to Japan in 1993, down 5 percent from the percentage 
registered in 1987. The farm goods ratio to Taiwan's total 
imports from Japan also dropped to 1.2 percent last year from 
2.8 percent in 1987. 
  Husbandry goods, pork in particular, formed the bulk of 
Taiwan's farm exports to Japan, accounting for 46.3 percent of 
the total last year. Aquacultural products followed at 34 
percent. 
  Taiwan has incurred a huge trade deficit in its overall 
trade 
with Japan as it has relied heavily on Japan for the supply of 
machinery, parts and industrial materials. 
  Taiwan registered a record trade deficit of US$14.2 billion 
with Japan in 1993 and the amount is expected to surge further 
to a new high of US$16 billion this year. The trade imbalance 
already hit US$4.96 billion in the first four months of this 
year, according to customs tallies.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, May 16 (CNA) -- Uniglory Marine Corp., 
a subsidiary of Taiwan's Evergreen Group, recently launched 
container service between Taiwan and Argentina. 
  A Uniglory ship made its maiden call at the Buenos Aires 
port 
last week, thus opening another ship connection between Taiwan 
and Argentina. The Taipei-based Chien Hong opened its container 
service between Taiwan and Argentina through South Africa in 
1992. 
  Omar Leirado, spokesman for the Heinlein Maritime Agency, 
Uniglory's agency in Buenos Aires, said that eight full 
container ships have been assigned to ply the route between 
Taiwan and Argentina. "This will initially give us an average 
frequency of one vessel calling at Buenos Aires every 11 days," 
he said. 
  Two-way trade between Argentina and Taiwan totaled some 
US$300 million in 1993.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- In order to put the 
principle of "one country, two systems" into practice, China 
must adopt the policy of letting the Hong Kong people rule Hong 
Kong and allowing Hong Kong enjoy a high degree of autonomy, a 
Chinese official said here today. 
  "To preserve the capit!list system in Hong Kong, we need the 
Hong Kong people who are familiar with the capitalist operations 
to manage themselves," said Lu Ping, director of Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council at a luncheon in his 
honor. 
  "As stipulated in the Basic Law, after 1997, Hong Kong will 
joy its own administrative, legislative and judicial powers.

<F P=106> [Feature by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 </F>
0251) and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 1627): "Hold High the 
Banner of the Shock Brigade -- Li Ruihuan Meeting With 
Representatives of Old and Young Shock Brigades"] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Two generations of 
shock brigade leaders in the capital today happily gathered at 
the Beijing International Convention Center, with each wearing a 
big bright-colored red flower on his chest. At 0900, when Li 
Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau, and Zhang Baifa, executive deputy 
mayor of Beijing, entered the center, all those present gave 
warm applause to them who both served as leaders of shock 
brigades well-known throughout the country in the 1950s. 
[passage omitted] 
  Youth shock brigades came into being in the 1950s as 
national 
economic construction was on the upsurge. In the new situation 
brought about by reform and opening-up, the banner of the shock 
brigade has become ever more resplendent, under which a large 
number of young pioneering workers have emerged. [passage 
omitted] 
  On behalf of the younger generation, Li Keqiang, first 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth 
League, asked the older generation to rest assured that the 
younger generation would carry forward the fine tradition of the 
older generation and that the banner of the shock brigade would 
fly high into the next century. 
  Forty years elapsed in the twinkling of an eye. Recalling 
the past and comparing it with the present, Li Ruihuan was 
excited. He said: "Tremendous changes have taken place in our 
country over the past 40 years. During these years, youth shock 
brigades in the capital have made outstanding contributions to 
the construction of the city, winning honor for building 
workers, for Beijing residents, and for the Chinese people. 
Youth shock brigades have scored marked achievements, gained a 
wealth of experience, trained a large number of qualified 
personnel, and formed fine traditions and work style. I hope 
that you carry forward all such good things and develop them." 
  Liu Ruihuan then said: "The new situation has set new 
requirements for us. I hope that while carrying forward the 
tradition, you will gain fresh, more useful experiences. You 
should not only do a good job in building houses and roads but 
also step up your ideological education. A new generation of 
well-educated, well-disciplined people with lofty ideals and 
moral values should be cultivated. It is hoped that the younger 
generation is better and stronger than the older one." 
  Words with deep feeling and ardent exhortation! 
  When Li Ruihuan finished his speech, the audience responded 
with warm applause.

the "Bronze Statue of Jiao Yulu" were solemnly and 
simultaneously inaugurated at a ceremony held in Lankao County 
today. 
  Jiang Zemin, CPC Central Committee general secretary, had 
inscribed "Memorial Hall of Comrade Jiao Yulu" for the ceremony. 
  Those attending the ceremony included: Hu Jintao, CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee member and

  Today's ceremony was presided over by Song Zhaosu, Henan 
Provincial CPC Committee deputy secretary. 
  Hu Jintao; Li Changchun, Henan Provincial CPC Committee 
secretary; and Wang Rixin, Kaifeng City CPC Committee secretary,

speech at the ceremony in which he cherished dearly the memory 
of the late Comrade Jiao Yulu and urged all comrades to learn 
from him; carry forward the Jiao Yulu spirit; and strive to make

  Then the CPC department and state ministry leaders; the 
provincial, prefectural, and county leaders; and the late 
Comrade Jiao Yulu's family members, including sons and 
daughters, entered the memorial hall, where they stood in silent 
mourning in front of the bronze statue.

  [Text] Beijing, May 18 (AFP) -- China said Wednesday the 
country's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng was still 
under investigation, denying reports that a formal decision had 
been reached to bring him to trial. A Public Security Ministry 
spokesman made it clear that investigations into alleged "fresh 
crimes" committed by Wei had yet to be concluded. "Wei 
Jingsheng violated Chinese law while he was released on parole 
and his political rights were withdrawn, and the police are in 
the process of investigating his case," the spokesman said. 
Foreign press reports quoting the ministry as saying Wei's case 
had been handed over to the Chinese courts were "completely 
false," he said. 
  Wei, 44, was picked up by police April 1 as he tried to 
return to Beijing from a forced exile in nearby Tianjin. The 
authorities then announced that he was being investigated for 
unspecified new crimes. Wei was released on parole in September 
last year, having served all but six months of a 15-year 
sentence for counter-revolutionary activities. The Chinese 
authorities were incensed when Wei met here in February with 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Humanitarian Affairs John 
Shattuck and called on Washington to take a hard line with 
Beijing over human rights.

<F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang and agencies] </F>
  [Text] China has confirmed it will bring treason charges 
against its most famous dissident Wei Jingsheng, while another 
prominent dissident Wang Dan was held by Beijing police for an 
hour yesterday. 
  A spokesman from the Ministry of Public Security said 
yesterday detectives had already completed their investigation 
of Mr Wei, and the results had been handed over to the Beijing 
prosecutor's office. "We have handed our results to the Beijing 
Procuratorate, who will take his case before the courts," the 
spokesman said, adding that he was not aware of a timetable for 
the indictment or trial. 
  After more than a month of Foreign Ministry hints, sources 
close to the Justice Ministry acknowledged that Mr Wei could 
stand trial as early as next month. In what will inevitably be 
a high-profile trial, prosecutors will charge Mr Wei, the 
undisputed leader of China's dissident community, with "plotting 
to overthrow the government using foreign forces", one source 
said. The far-fetched charge of overthrowing the government, 
which sources say could be only one of up to three Beijing will 
bring, demonstrates the authorities' fear of their most vocal 
critic as public order begins to fray. Treason carries a 
possible life jail sentence. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Wang told foreign journalists in Beijing he 
was 
taken to a police station at 11 am yesterday and released an 
hour later. The former student leader of 1989 pro-democracy 
demonstrations was arrested by 10 policemen during an interview 
with five journalists from the American television network NBC 
at his home. "They held me for about an hour, mainly to 
question me about how the interview was arranged, things like 
that," he said. 
  Mr Wang said he had not been ordered to refuse interviews 
and 
would talk to foreign correspondents who sought him out. He 
also said he planned to leave Beijing of his own accord at the 
end of the month. Mr Wang said his detention probably reflected 
official efforts to control news gathering by foreign reporters 
in the runup to 4 June, the fifth anniversary of Beijing's 
crushing of the 1989 pro-democracy protests. It is also the 
date by which United States President Bill Clinton must decide 
whether to renew China's low-tariff most-favoured-nation trade 
privileges. "I will not refuse to give interviews to anyone," a 
defiant Mr Wang said. 
  Members of the NBC television crew, who were detained 
separately, said they were released after several hours of 
questioning. 
  Authorities worried about possible attempts to commemorate 
the Tiananmen Square massacre have been rounding up dissidents 
or putting them under round-the-clock surveillance. 
  Sources in Shanghai said Yang Qinheng, a long-time democracy 
activist, was the latest to be arrested, and that police told 
his wife he might be released after 4 June. It was not clear 
exactly when Mr Yang was arrested. At least six other Shanghai 
dissidents have been arrested since April. The brother of one, 
Lin Muchen, said police had refused to give the family any 
information. 
  In Beijing, police moved ahead of the anniversary to 
round-up 
dissidents, send some temporarily out of the capital and warned 
others to avoid foreign journalists and stay at home.

<F P=106> [By a special correspondent in Beijing: "Beijing Plans To </F>
Accuse Yuan Hongbing and Zhou Guoqiang of Subversion"] 
  [Text] A source has disclosed that the relevant mainland 
departments are considering a new charge of "inciting 
counterrevolutionary propaganda" against noted dissident Wei 
Jingsheng. They also plan to accuse another two dissidents Yuan 
Hongbing and Zhou Guoqiang of "subversion." It is very likely 
that these dissidents will be sentenced to two to five years 
imprisonment. 
  The source said that mainland authorities are very angry 
about what Wei Jingsheng said and did after he was granted 
parole, terming him "a man who is refusing to mend his ways 
despite repeated admonitions." As early as March, CPC General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin told the public security organs to keep 
the pro-democracy figures, "who thought they had backing from 
foreigners," strictly under control and take resolute measures 
when necessary. 
  Reportedly, the mainland authorities were most embarrassed 
by 
Wei Jingsheng, who successfully eluded security personnel on 26 
February and met with Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of 
state, who was on a visit to Beijing. Prior to that, Wei 
Jingsheng mysteriously disappeared for two days, which made the 
authorities think that he had attempted to flee abroad. After 
the incident, the departments concerned tightened their control 
over Wei. Nevertheless, Wei continued to give frequent 
interviews to Western reporters. According to the departments 
concerned, what Wei has said and done constitutes a violation of 
China's law. 
  It has been reported that the authorities will accuse Wei 
Jingsheng of "inciting counterrevolutionary propaganda." But 
the sentence has not yet been determined. 
  At the same time, Yuan Hongbing, a lecturer in Beijing 
University's Law Faculty who is suspected of establishing an 
underground "illegal organization," and Zhou Guoqiang, a 
pro-democracy figure who set up a "Labor Union" and launched a 
signature drive, are to face prison. The Judicial Department 
plans to accuse them of the crime of "subverting the government." 
  The source disclosed that Yuan Hongbing, Wang Jiaqi (who 
fled 
to Hong Kong on 15 April), and Zhou Guoqiang set up an 
underground trade union called the "Labor Union" earlier this 
year. More than 100 people joined the union which was uncovered 
by the relevant Beijing departments. A number of people 
involved in the case have been detained since February for 
interrogation. However, the aforementioned initiators will be 
sternly punished. 
  Reportedly, the moves planned by the mainland authorities 
will be announced in the near future. The final decision 
depends on the changes taking place in the international 
political atmosphere.

<F P=106> [By a special correspondent in Shijiazhuang: "Accompanied </F>
by Public Security Personnel, Chen Ziming Is Recuperating in 
Shijiazhuang"] 
  [Text] Mainland dissident Chen Ziming, who was "granted 
parole for medical treatment" by Beijing authorities, is now 
"resting" and taking necessary treatment in Hebei's 
Shijiazhuang. However, all Chen's moves are carried out in the 
presence of public security personnel. 
  "Escorted" by the relevant departments, a source here said, 
Chen Ziming and his wife arrived in Shijiazhuang last week for a 
"short recuperation." Chen Ziming and his wife have stayed in 
an ordinary guest house over the past few days. He was told 
that after a period of recuperation here, he can return to 
Beijing in early June. 
  As everyone knows, the source said that Chen Ziming has been 
sent to another locality to recuperate because of the upcoming 
fifth anniversary of the "4 June incident." Many foreign 
reporters are now in Beijing awaiting an opportunity to 
interview the pro-democracy figures of 1989. The authorities do 
not want Chen Ziming to be interviewed by foreign reporters at 
this time. The departments concerned do not know what Chen 
would say and what viewpoints he would express in interviews and 
they are worried that the results would be disadvantageous to 
China's bid for the most favored nation trading status. 
  Before his release, it is said that Chen promised the 
authorities that he would be away from Beijing for a period of 
time after he is granted "parole for medical treatment."

  [Text] May 23 will mark the 43rd anniversary of the 
peaceful liberation of Tibet. A spokesman for the United Front 
Work Department of the CPC Central Committee recently spoke to a 
XINHUA reporter on development and construction in the Tibet 
Autonomous Region and the central government's policy on the 
Dalai Lama. 
  Question [Q]: What major changes have taken place in Tibet 
over the past 43 years? 
  Answer [A]: On May 23, 1951, the central government and 
local Tibetan government signed a 17-article agreement on the 
peaceful liberation of Tibet that effectively made it a reality. 
  The peaceful liberation of Tibet was a major component of 
the 
emancipation cause of the Chinese people. Since then, Tibetans, 
like members of other nationalities in China, have fully enjoyed 
equal rights and embarked on the road to freedom and happiness. 
  Over the past 43 years, Tibet has undergone tremendous 
changes, from backward serfdom to modernization. The 1 million 
serfs have become masters of their own destiny, while large 
numbers of Tibetan workers, intellectuals and cadres have become 
mature and taken up the task of building and managing Tibet. 
  With the support of the central government and the 
assistance 
of other provinces and cities, as well as through the efforts of 
Tibetan people, Tibet has scored great achievements in various 
fields. 
  Last year, Tibet hit an all-time high in its grain 
production 
by harvesting a yield of 620,000 tons, and the number of large 
domestic livestock rose to 23.2 million. Its modern industry, 
which started from scratch, registered a total output value of 
470 million yuan, (US$54 million), and its energy, transport 
and telecommunications facilities improved markedly. 
  In the meantime, traditional Tibetan culture has been 
promoted, and gigantic progress has been made in the fields of 
education, science, culture and public health. Living standards 
for Tibetans have risen substantially, and the Tibetan 
population has soared to 2 million, double the 1950 figure. 
  Policies of the Party and the government on nationalities 
and 
religion enjoy wholehearted support from Tibetans and patriotic 
personages from all walks of life in the region. 
  To date, Tibet is presenting a picture of vitality and 
prosperity. 
  Tibetans have made great contributions to maintaining the 
unity of the motherland and among all nationalities and to the 
country's modernization drive. 
  In the future efforts of reform, opening up and 
establishment 
of a socialist market economy, the central government will 
continue to pursue policies conducive to Tibet's economic growth 
and improvement of the living standards for Tibetans. It will 
continue to mobilize people of all nationalities in China to 
assist Tibet in speeding up its development. It will combine 
its policy to assist Tibet with the region's self-development 
efforts and gear its economic assistance to the overall 
situation of reform so as to enhance the strength, vitality and 
sustained power of Tibet for development, thus achieving common 
prosperity. 
  Q: It is a historical fact that Tibet is an inseparable part 
of China. However, the Dalai Lama remains in exile and engages 
in activities which aim to split the country. What are the 
policies of the central government toward the Dalai Lama? Have 
there been any changes in them? 
  A: The basic position and attitude of the central government 
toward the Dalai Lama and his followers have been clear and 
consistent, and they remain unchanged. 
  As long as the Dalai Lama recognizes that Tibet is an 
inseparable part of China, completely abandons his idea of 
independence of Tibet and stops engaging in activities to split 
the motherland, the central government will welcome an earlier 
end to his life in exile and greet his return to China to 
contribute to the unification of the motherland, national unity 
and Tibetan economic development and perform something good for 
the prosperity and happiness of the Tibetan people. 
  In 1979, Deng Xiaoping made it clear to a private 
representative of the Dalai Lama that "the issue of fundamental 
importance is that Tibet is a part of China. That is the 
criterion with which to judge what is right and what is wrong". 
  When answering questions from a reporter of XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY on May 19, 1991, Premier Li Peng reiterated the central 
government's policy, "there is only one fundamental principle, 
that is, Tibet is an inseparable part of China. There is no 
room for bargaining on that point. The central government has 
always been ready to hold talks with the Dalai Lama, but he must 
stop engaging in activities to split the motherland and change 
his position on so-called independence of Tibet. Negotiations 
can be held on any questions, but not on the independence of 
Tibet." 
  These policies of the central government remain unchanged. 
  The issue of Tibet is China's internal affair. Any attempt 
to internationalize the issue of Tibet will not succeed and will 
be firmly opposed by the Chinese people. 
  Q: According to foreign news media, the Dalai Lama recently 
claimed on separate occasions that he has made maximum 
concessions in a series of initiatives and proposals in line 
with the framework for negotiations which defines that all 
questions except the independence of Tibet can be negotiated. 
Is that true? 
  A: It would be a great advance if the Dalai Lama had 
genuinely abandoned his stand for the independence of Tibet. 
But it is regrettable that we have seen no signs of such 
progress so far. 
  The Dalai Lama has never recognized that Tibet is an 
inseparable part of China since he went into exile, neither has 
he stopped his activities to split the motherland. 
  His claims and proposals have continually centered on his 
stand for the independence of Tibet. Even recently, he still 
referred to Tibet as a captive nation, saying "I firmly 
believe... we will eventually lead our captive nation to freedom 
and peace in dignity". His so-called concessions are nothing but 
an adjustment in his tactics. In essence, he still sticks to 
his stand for the independence of Tibet. 
  Q: It is said that the central government has made 
painstaking efforts to negotiate with the Dalai Lama. But the 
Dalai Lama has alleged on many occasions that the central 
government is unwilling to talk with him. What are the real 
facts? 
  A: Up to now, the Dalai Lama has not abandoned his stand for 
the independence of Tibet. This is the largest obstacle to 
negotiations. 
  The central government has made genuine efforts to help 
bring 
about negotiation and urge the Dalai Lama and his followers to 
abandon their position for the independence of Tibet and return 
to China. All these endeavors have fully demonstrated the 
sincerity and patience of the central government. 
  Since 1979, related departments of the central government 
have on many occasions received the Dalai Lama's private 
representatives and listened attentively to their reports of the 
Dalai Lama's intentions. Some of them were met by leading 
members of the central government. 
  When the Bainqen Lama died in early 1989, Zhao Puchu, 
president of the China Buddhist Association, personally handed a 
letter to the private representative of the Dalai Lama, inviting 
him home to attend the mourning activities. 
  Such an invitation, coming out of pure religious motives, 
could have been an excellent opportunity for the Dalai Lama to 
meet with members of domestic Buddhist circles after spending 
over 30 years in exile. However, the Dalai Lama turned it down. 
  In the latter half of 1989, in the wake of the changes in 
global situation, the Dalai Lama suspended contacts with the 
central government. In the same year, he brazenly divided China 
into several parts, such as Tibet, Xinjiang, Mongolia and 
Manchuria, in a map used in his book Freedom in Exile. 
  Since China's domestic situation had not turned in the 
direction the Dalai Lama had anticipated, in 1992, he asked to 
resume contacts with the central government. Relevant central 
government departments received his private representatives on 
two occasions in 1992 and 1993. 
  The reason the central government has not publicized its 
contacts and talks over the past 10-odd years with the private 
representatives of the Dalai Lama is that departments involved 
have made it clear to the Dalai Lama's private representatives 
at each of their meetings that the present contacts between the 
two sides are still secret associations which should not be made 
public. The Dalai Lama's private representatives also have 
agreed not to release details of the talks. But it is 
regrettable that the Dalai Lama's side has broken its promises 
time and again. It not only publicized these contacts, but also 
distorted what had been said at the talks, in an attempt to 
mislead the public. 
  Q: Why have the bilateral contacts not produced any results? 
  A: The reason that past contacts did not yield fruit and 
negotiations cannot commence lies in the fact that the Dalai 
Lama's side has not yet reached a common understanding with us 
on the fundamental issue that Tibet is an inseparable part of 
China. They have even referred to this cardinal principle 
adhered to by the central government as a precondition and 
obstacle to negotiations. We never think this is the case but 
see it as the basis and guarantee for the success of 
negotiations. 
  Q: It Is evident that the responsibility for inability to 
hold negotiations lies with the side of the Dalai Lama. Is 
there any possibility for progress of the Dalai Lama's side 
continues to refuse to budge from its original position? 
  A: In China, there is a saying which goes: "When the melon 
is ripe it falls off its stem; where water flows, a channel is 
formed." This means that when conditions are ripe, success will 
naturally follow. 
  Everything has its own law of development, and some matters 
will not become obvious nor be widely perceived if they have not 
reached a certain stage. The central government will continue 
its efforts with full sincerity and patience. After all, the 
Dalai Lama is a Chinese citizen. We hope that in his remaining 
years, the Dalai Lama will abandon his stand for the 
independence of Tibet, end his life in exile and return to the 
motherland. 
  Negotiation is the only appropriate way to resolve this 
problem. We hope that the Dalai Lama will size up the 
situation, go with the tide of historical development and make 
the right choice.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- To further arouse the 
enthusiasm of people of all nationalities throughout the country 
in promoting reform, opening up, and the construction of 
socialism for better fulfillment of the various tasks forwarded 
by the 14th CPC National Congress, the State Council has decided 
to hold a rally on the eve of "1 May," international Labor Day, 
1995 to commend national model and advanced workers who have 
made outstanding contributions in various fields and fronts amid 
reform and construction. The State Council issued a circular to 
this effect today to the people's governments of various 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under 
the central government; and various ministries, commissions, and 
organs directly under the State Council. 
  According to the State Council circular, 3,000 national 
model 
and advanced workers will be commended, covering workers, 
peasants, professionals, technicians, management personnel, 
government workers, and others who have made outstanding 
contributions toward reform, opening up, economic construction, 
industrial and agricultural production, and various social 
undertakings since 1989. 
  The circular stated that the State Council has decided to 
form the National Model and Advanced Workers Recognition Rally 
Organizing Committee to lead preparations for the occasion, with 
Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general of the State 
Council, as chairman and the following as vice chairmen: Zhang 
Dinghua, vice president of the All-China Federation of Trade 
Unions and first secretary of its secretariat; Song Defu, 
personnel minister; Li Boyong, labor minister; Wang Zhongyu, 
minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission; 
Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the State Education 
Commission; Zhu Lilan, vice minister in charge of the State 
Science and Technology Commission; Liu Jiang, agriculture 
minister; Hu Guangbao, deputy director of the CPC Central 
Committee General Office; and Li Shuwen, deputy secretary 
general of the State Council. An organizing committee office 
will be set up with Li Shuwen, deputy secretary general of the 
State Council, serving concurrently as director. 
  The State Council circular pointed out that selecting and 
commending national model and advanced workers will be a major 
event in the political lives of the Chinese people of all 
nationalities. To ensure success, the people's governments of 
various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities 
directly under the central government as well as relevant 
departments must strengthen leadership and be conscientious in 
organizing the recognition rally. Grass-root level and front 
lines of economic construction will be the main focus for 
selecting national model workers and advanced work personnel. 
Advanced figures known for their persistence in upholding the 
party's basic line, in consistently working hard without being 
upset by criticism, and in promoting reform with new creations 
and outstanding deeds should be selected. Minority women and 
people should be selected according to fixed proportions. 
Through selection activities, we should widely publicize the 
exemplary deeds and lofty spirit of advanced individuals from 
various trades and professions, in a bid to mobilize the broad 
masses to take them as example when striving for new success in 
reform, opening up, and modernization drive. 
  Meanwhile, the National Model and Advanced Workers 
Recognition Rally Organizing Committee held its first meeting in 
the afternoon of 27 April, presided over by its chairman, Luo 
Gan.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- To facilitate the 
implementation of the "Interim Regulations Governing State 
Public Servants," to supervise and encourage public servants to 
fulfill duties honestly and diligently, and to improve office 
work efficiency, the Personnel Ministry recently promulgated the 
"Interim Provisions for Evaluating State Public Servants," thus 
epitomizing the standardization and institutionalization of 
evaluation of public servants. 
  It is understood that the "provisions" clearly define the 
principle of fairness in evaluating public servants and require 
that they be evaluated both periodically and on a routine basis 
and by supervisors as well as the masses. Public servants are 
evaluated in four areas: morality, capability, diligence, and 
performance, with the focus on actual work performance. The 
evaluation criterion should be based on the position, duties, 
and work assignments of public servants who are rated as 
outstanding, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory. The number of 
public servants rated as outstanding should not exceed 15 
percent of the public servants in each department. 
  The "provisions" demand that the evaluation of public 
servants should attach importance to actual results and should 
be simple, convenient, and easily carried out. The evaluation, 
which is to be made by senior department officials, is divided 
into routine and annual evaluation. Routine evaluation, to be 
carried out at any time, requires a public servant being 
evaluated to factually fill in work records; whereas annual 
evaluation is to be carried out once a year at yearend or at the 
beginning of the next year. The basic procedures of annual 
evaluation, which is based on routine evaluation, are as 
follows: a public servant being evaluated first makes a summary 
of his or her own performance; after listening to opinions of 
the masses, the public servant's immediate supervisor writes 
comments and recommends an evaluation rating on the basis of 
routine evaluation records and the individual's performance 
summary; the evaluation committee or group examines the 
supervisor's comments and recommendations; and after a senior 
department official decides on an evaluation rating, the 
evaluation committee or group will send a written notification 
to the public servant concerned. 
  The "provisions" also demand that state administrative 
institutions set up ad hoc annual evaluation committees or 
groups to take charge of the annual evaluation of public 
servants under the supervision of a senior department official. 
The ad hoc evaluation committee is made up of senior department 
officials and representatives of public servants. The number of 
representatives, to be elected through democratic procedures, 
should be at least one third of the total number of members of 
the committee or group. The responsibilities of evaluation 
committees or groups are, in accordance with the relevant 
provisions, to formulate procedures for conducting annual 
evaluation; to organize, coordinate, and supervise each 
department's annual evaluation work; to examine evaluation 
comments and recommendations for rating written by the immediate 
supervisor; and to examine application for reconsideration by 
public servants who are not satisfied with evaluation results. 
  To make the evaluation more effective, the "provisions" 
provide appropriate rewards and penalties for evaluation 
results: public servants receiving a satisfactory or above 
rating in their annual evaluation will be given a cash award 
equivalent to one month's salary; those receiving a satisfactory 
or above rating for two consecutive years will be given an 
in-grade step increase in salary; those receiving an outstanding 
rating for two consecutive years or a satisfactory or above 
rating for three consecutive years will be qualified for job 
promotions; and those receiving an outstanding rating for three 
consecutive years, or a satisfactory or above rating for five 
consecutive years, will be promoted to the next higher grade of 
the current posts. Public servants whose performance is deemed 
unsatisfactory in annual evaluation will be demoted to a lower 
position job; and those receiving an unsatisfactory rating for 
two consecutive years will be dismissed. 
  In addition, the "provisions" also provide specific 
procedures for public servants to apply for reconsideration of 
evaluation results.

<F P=106> [Article by Willy Wo-lap Lam: "Nobody Rocks the Boat During </F>
Deng's Last Days"] 
  [Text] Once again economics has become the hand-maiden of 
politics. And politics serves the goal of "stability", 
Beijing's euphemism for one-party domination. To give the 
impression that the economy is in order and everything is under 
(party) control, various ministries and media have been 
dispensing misleading and, at times, contradictory information. 
And to prevent hyperinflation and unemployment -- a potent mix 
that might jeopardise the "dictatorship of the proletariat" -- 
from worsening, numerous market reforms have been put on hold. 
  Let us first examine claims last Thursday [12 May] by the 
Minister of the State Economics and Trade Commission (SETC), 
Wang Zhongyu, that, according to a survey of 16 provinces and 
cities, "barely 10 per cent" of enterprises had either stopped 
production or were operating below capacity". Mr Wang, 
sometimes regarded as Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji's point man for 
fiscal liberalisation, then charged the foreign press with 
exaggerating the plight of the state-owned sector. 
  The SETC chief's assertions contradict numerous internal and 
public surveys that at least 40 per cent of government-run 
enterprises in major cities have been shut down or are idling. 
The situation would actually be scarier if Mr Wang's statements 
were true. It would mean that the banks were again printing 
money to bail out state-held firms, 47 per cent of which are in 
the red. 
  Then there were the equally wild claims last month by cadres 
and the media alike that inflation had been "brought under 
control". These contentions were based on the fact that, in 
March, the year-on-year increase in consumer prices was 0.5 per 
cent less than that in February. Comparable figures for the 
services sector and for producer goods were respectively 0.3 and 
5.1 per cent. 
  These statistics -- and the rosy projections based on them 
-- 
are queried by Western economists. Aside from the need to 
bankroll money-losing enterprises and pay millions of workers 
who are owed back salaries, the central government has been 
unable to curb spending, due to its failure to stop localities 
engaging in development projects that are outside state plans. 
  Speaking in Hong Kong last week, the Vice-Minister of 
Construction Tan Qinglian said fixed-asset investment this year 
would come to 1,300 billion yuan (about HK$1,157 billion), up 13 
per cent from 1993. The semi-official China News Service (CNS) 
[ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE] reported last week, however, that the 
outlay on new infrastructure would actually amount to a 
staggering 1,500 billion yuan. 
  And how about reports that grain production had "stabilised" 
in spite of the massive depletion of arable land as well as the 
dramatic speed with which farmers are forsaking wheat and rice 
for commercial crops. Earlier this week, CNS quoted agrarian 
experts as expressing optimism about future harvests because 
"China's comprehensive ability to produce grain had in general 
stabilised at the level of over 425 billion kilograms". 
  Informed sources said the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) and 
the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) had come up with different 
statistics for the 1993 grain yield, and a ferocious argument 
had broken out over which set of figures should be used. The 
substantially higher SSB statistics were challenged by the MOA, 
which contended that, given factors including loss of land and 
bad harvests, their figures were more realistic. The State 
Council decided against the MOA, on the grounds that "most 
people had assumed that China's capacity was 425 billion kg and 
a figure significantly lower than that could trigger the kind of 
panic buying that took place last December". 
  Even more disturbing than cooking the books, however, is the 
decision by Beijing to maintain order and stability by 
mothballing or scaling down reform measures announced last 
November. Citing the fact that Beijing had lost 500 billion 
yuan worth of state assets in the past decade, the central 
government has clamped down on the key reform measure -- the 
sale and radical restructuring of state-owned firms. The State 
Council announced last weekend it had taken back powers by 
provincial and municipal administrations to sell state firms to 
foreigners or to convert them into shareholding companies. 
  Also under the pretext of restoring fiscal discipline, 
Vice-Premier Zhu has ordered the temporary closure of futures 
markets in areas including steel, sugar and coal. All existing 
futures markets have to be re-registered after a strict auditing 
process. 
  Displaying his colours as the Great Rectifier, Mr Zhu has 
been touring the provinces dispensing old-style state fiats 
along the way. The economic tsar ordered Guangdong and Zhejiang 
to grow more grain. Guizhou was told to slash tobacco 
production. And Heilongjiang and Liaoning were asked to change 
the production lines of their enterprises. In a throwback to 
central planning, specific targets were slapped on localities. 
For example, the acreage for real-estate development for 
Guangdong has been set at 100,000 mu (one mu equals 0.0667 
hectares). Fujian was told to close 20 "wasteful" industrial 
parks to save 102 sq km of land. 
  And in spite of its commitment to rejoining the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Beijing has put new restrictions 
on foreign trade in an apparent effort to narrow its US$12 
billion (HK$92.6 billion) a year trade deficit. For example, 
Beijing arbitrarily stopped the import of a range of 
petrochemical products in the spring, and local governments' 
autonomous powers over foreign trade have been curtailed. 
  Summing up the conservative mode in economic policy, SETC's 
Mr Wang said last week: "Whether it is today or tomorrow, 
privatisation is not the necessary trend for the reform of 
China's state-held enterprises. It is also impossible for the 
state-owned sector to be replaced by other economic elements -- 
or for it to undergo major structural changes." 
  As Premier Li Peng reiterated on Monday, "maintaining social 
stability is the major business that the centre and localities 
must grasp". 
  The sober reality is that, instead of looking ahead and 
finding long-term solutions, the leadership is making do with 
stop-gap measures to shore up the regime, such as 
re-centralising economic decision-making, propping up the ailing 
state enterprises, and keeping the 200 million unemployed on the 
dole. 
  Living under the shadow of Deng Xiaoping's impending death 
-- 
and the power struggle that will ensue should he pass on -- even 
usually vigorous politicians such as Mr Zhu are unwilling to 
take the smallest risks.

<F P=106> ["LIAOWANG Forum" column by Mo Ru (5459 1172): "Party </F>
Style, Government Style, Work Style"] 
  [Text] The problems in party, government, and cadre styles 
have drawn a lot of comments. 
  As far back as 1980, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and other 
leaders of the older generation solemnly pointed out: The style 
of a ruling party is one concerning the life and death and the 
rise and fall of the party. Since then, the party Central 
Committee and the State Council have always listed the 
rectification of party and government styles and a change in 
cadre style as an important element that has to be grasped every 
year. To this end, they have approved and adopted a series of 
decisions and measures for rectifying unhealthy tendencies, 
fighting corruption, and advocating clean government. At its 
second meeting last year, the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission put forward the tasks, requirements, and specific 
policies for the anticorruption struggle. At its third meeting, 
held some time ago, it again put forward specific requirements 
for the anticorruption struggle. These important decisions and 
measures have played an important role in the building of the 
party, political power, and the contingent of cadres. However, 
it should also be noted that the phenomenon of impurities in 
party, government, and cadre styles are still serious. Although 
the struggle against corruption has attained marked results, 
there is still a big gap when compared with the actual problems 
and the demands of the masses. 
  How, then, should we approach the problems in party, 
government, and cadre styles? 
  There is a view that, despite the efforts to rectify them 
annually, the problems in party, government, and cadre styles 
still exist, have gone from bad to worse, and have become an 
incurable disease. In the eyes of these comrades, there seem to 
be only negative and dark sides without any ray of light. This 
is similar to Su San's remark in "Sending a Prisoner Away Under 
Escort": "There is not a good person in Hongdong County." Is 
that so? No. This is a one-sided, exaggerated, and pessimistic 
view. If you challenge them to "cite the facts," they can only 
cite tidbits of phenomena and rumors. Although there are indeed 
many problems in actual life, we should make an analysis when 
looking at them. At the macro level, since the reform and 
opening up a dozen years or so ago, China's productive forces 
have been enormously emancipated, with the output of steel, 
coal, electricity, petroleum, and grain doubling and redoubling; 
with its gross domestic product exceeding 3,000 billion yuan and 
its foreign trade volume approaching $200 billion, China's 
comprehensive national power has grown considerably; and the 
urban and rural people's livelihood has generally improved. 
This is a universally acknowledged tremendous achievement! 
Even former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said with 
assurance that China would become a major economic power in the 
world in his remaining years. Looking around the world today, 
which country has developed at such a high speed and attained 
such huge achievements? Given such a flourishing and vigorous 
country, it is inconceivable that its leadership should be 
"unacceptable." 
  "The policies of the central authorities are good and the 
enthusiasm of the masses is soaring." This is entirely correct. 
What is similarly correct is that the party and government 
cadres at all levels have performed meritorious deeds that 
cannot be obliterated in implementing the good policies and 
organizing and bringing into play the people's wisdom. Most 
cadres have made contributions and worked painstakingly in 
promoting reform and opening up, state progress, social 
stability, and economic development. "Once the line is 
established, cadres are the determining factor." This is a 
truth repeatedly proved in history. 
  We can also make observations from a micro level. Everyone 
can observe the cadres and party members around him and make a 
fair, unprejudiced assessment. Are the good and relatively good 
cadres in the majority or are the bad and unacceptable ones? An 
objective figure can help some comrades change their excessive 
estimate. The conclusion will be that the mainstream of our 
ranks is good and the healthy tendency is predominant. Such an 
estimate does not in any way cover up the seriousness of 
corruption and the urgent need to rectify party, government, and 
cadre styles. 
  There is also another view which underestimates the 
seriousness and urgency of the anticorruption struggle. These 
people believe that economic development overrides everything, 
that it does not count for much to have some bureaucratism, some 
problems of work style, and some problems of eating, using, and 
taking more than one is entitled to, and that we should not be 
too serious about them. These comrades no longer like to hear 
"self-reliance and hard struggle" or talk about "serving the 
people." They only pay lip service to the need to "maintain 
ties with the masses and integrate theory with practice" and act 
as if "practicing strict economy and thrift in all undertakings" 
is out of fashion. Such a viewpoint is totally wrong. 
Precisely due to the evil influence of such ideas, various 
strange phenomena, such as inviting people to dinner, presenting 
gifts, extorting or asking for money and goods, going in for 
ostentation and extravagance, and practicing fraud, have been 
rampant despite repeated prohibitions. Some people publicly 
accept bribes and invitations to dinner, saying: "Are we not 
practicing a market economy and compensated service. It is a 
matter of course that you should spend money and I do the work. 
Thus, the principle of commodity exchange has been brought into 
the government administration of state organs and the decadent 
bourgeois idea of "putting money first in everything" has 
penetrated the Communist Party. Is this not serious! If this 
should be allowed to spread unchecked, "a small ant hole can 
cause the dam to collapse." Have not some people been put in 
prison as a result? It is quite necessary to suggest to these 
comrades, especially the leading comrades: Please go among the 
masses and hear the satirical doggerel or ragged verses created 
by the masses, which vividly delineate the lamentable image of 
some cadres. These aspirations of the people are the good 
medicine that will sober up the cadres! 
  There is a vivid saying: "People take up the bowl to eat 
meat but curse unceasingly as soon as they put it down." 
"People take up the bowl to eat meat" means that the economy 
has developed and that the people's livelihood has improved. 
This is naturally a good thing. "But curse unceasingly as soon 
as they put it down" means people are so discontented with some 
phenomena of corruption that their initiative and enthusiasm 
have been dampened. 
  The various forms of corruption and the various unhealthy 
tendencies have seriously obstructed the course of reform, 
opening up, and development and seriously hampered the masses 
from giving scope to their initiative and enthusiasm. 
Rectifying party, government, and work styles, fighting 
corruption, and opposing unhealthy tendencies is a long-term, 
complicated, arduous, and urgent struggle. We should have both 
firm conviction and perseverance and, in line with the 
requirements of the party Central Committee, do a good job in 
the anticorruption struggle and in building clean government so 
that our party, government, and cadre styles can be purer and 
suit the needs of the great undertaking of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on crime, investigations, trials, sentencings, and other 
judicial-related activities in the PRC monitored by Hong Kong 
Bureau during the period 1-16 May. The source and mode of 
processing are given in parentheses at the end of each entry. 
Certain reports deemed more significant may have been filed 
separately, in which case the summary will include the serial 
number of the separately filed item. 
  As evidenced by the stories listed below, during the month 
PRC crime reportage focused on common crime, including car 
theft, murder, robbery, kidnapping, and drug dealing. 
<H5>  National </H5>
<H5>  Mainland Cracks False Invoices </H5>
  Mainland authorities have cracked a number of serious cases 
of false invoices. Some unlawful elements changed the amounts 
of money on invoices to swindle money from companies, and some 
printed false invoices to evade taxes. For example, a 29-yuan 
invoice for a piece of cloth was changed to 115,000 yuan, and 
some people have bought false invoices to claim reimbursement 
from the accounting departments. Beijing police recently 
cracked a gang who printed and sold false invoices, crushed 
three dens, arrested 22 suspects, and seized 295 copies of 
invoices which certify payment of state value-added taxes. 
Shenzhen police also cracked a similar case, arrested 35 
persons, and seized 600 such invoices. Law courts, 
procuratorates, public security organs, and taxation departments 
made joint arrangements to crack down on false invoices 
throughout the whole country. They decided that a fraud-proof 
value-added tax invoice, which can be used across the country, 
will be printed solely by a certain department and used 
beginning 1 July. (Summary) (Hong Kong ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE in

  On 18 April, Fuzhou police arrested Huang Tou-chiu and Chen 
Yu, the two Taiwanese who were heads of a kidnapping gang 
operating in Fuzhou. On 13 April, a person named Lin, the boss 
of a karaoke club in Fuzhou, was kidnapped at gun point, and his 
family was later told to pay $400,000 for his release, or one of 
his fingers would be chopped off every day after the deadline. 
Witnesses told the police what had happened and the police 
swiftly cracked the case and rescued Lin. (Summary) (Hong Kong

Court. The two engineers, aged 24 and 34, were hired to smuggle 
"ice" from Xiamen to the Philippines in 1991. Xiamen customs 
officers found 1.11 kg of ice in two travelling bags the men 
were carrying at the Gaoqi airport on October 15. (Summary)

  [Text] In line with their different conditions, Hailun 
city has adopted various forms to sell its 13 state-owned 
enterprises in order to enable them to regain their vitality. 
  The enterprises on sale have long suffered losses and have 
been on the verge of bankruptcy. The accumulated volume of 
losses amounted to more than 2 million yuan. The city 
previously adopted the contracting and leasing systems to save 
these enterprises. However, these systems have proved to be only 
slightly effective. In response, since 1993 the city has sent 
its work teams to carry out investigations to learn about their 
situation. These teams have also estimated their assets and had 
them form a list according to their different situation so that 
these enterprises can be sold all at once, sold by issuing 
shares, and sold by transferring the repayment of bank loans and 
debts. 
  The city has sold all at once through public bidding the 
rubber plant, the fertilizer plant, and the daily chemical 
necessities plant because their management has been relatively 
poor and their losses have been serious. After the sale, these 
state-owned plants have become privately run enterprises. 
  As for the vibration prescription equipment plant, whose 
equipment runs well, the department in charge of the sale has 
fixed its sale price at 1.1 million yuan and sold it by issuing 
shares to the 132 staff members and workers of the plant. 
  As for the shoe general plant, the knitwear general factory, 
and the No.3 foodstuffs plant, whose debits and bank loans have 
been relatively large, the city has rented them out by 
transferring the repayment of their bank loans and debts. This 
means these plants can be leased in line with the negotiated 
prices without paying the entire sum for the deal, but have the 
renters be responsible for repaying the bank loans and debts. 
The property rights of these plants is owned by the staff 
members and workers. 
  After the sale, all legal persons in these enterprises said: 
More persons have assumed responsibility in the enterprise at 
present, more personnel have taken charge of management, and 
more persons have a sense of crisis. Since the beginning of 
this year, the fertilizer plant has turned out more than 3,000 
tonnes of compound fertilizer of various categories, showing a 
50 percent increase over the same period of 1993. The mining 
parts plant has turned out more than 460 tonnes of steel ingots 
and shape steel products, topping the previous peak scored in 
the same period. The vibration prescription equipment plant has 
succeeded in increasing the variety of three new products within 
a short period of several months. Each share owned by the staff 
members and workers of the plant is expected to increase its 
value by 20 percent. The wages of staff members and workers in 
the fertilizer plant has shown a 100 percent increase over that 
before the sale.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Make the Old Industrial Base Regain </F>
Its Vigor"] 
  [Text] Heilongjiang is one of the earliest industrial bases 
developed and constructed by the state. In the four decades and 
more since the founding of the country, it has provided to the 
state large amounts of oil, coal, timber, large complete sets of 
power station equipment, machines, and national defense and 
military equipment and 142.7 billion yuan of profits and taxes, 
thus playing its role as an old industrial base. 
  Due to the influence of systems, policies, our own work, and 
other factors, investment in technical transformation was 
lacking to a serious extent in the past few years. As a result, 
merely 10 percent of the large- and medium-sized enterprises, 
whose output value accounted for 75 percent and whose original 
value of fixed assets and profits and taxes delivered to the 
state accounted for 80 percent of the province's total, 
underwent systematic transformation, more than a half of their 
equipment is in a state of extended service or will soon have to 
be scrapped, and the products of a half of the enterprises are 
in recession. Large- and medium-sized enterprises are faced 
with numerous difficulties in production and operation, and an 
overwhelming majority of them have been operated at low speed 
and low efficiency for a long period. In addition, we have 
failed for many years to build the new projects that can promote 
local economic development, our industrial structure has yet to 
be radically adjusted, the overall economic efficiency is low, 
and the role as an old industrial base is weakening. To regain 
the magnificence of Heilongjiang, accelerate economic 
development, and continue to make still greater contributions to 
the state, the historical task to speed up the transformation of 
the old industrial base is thus included in our work schedule. 
  Heilongjiang enjoys complete branches of industry, strong 
technological force, and pretty good equipment foundation. Many 
of its products, such as the three major power resources, 
heavy-duty machines, precision bearings, and flax fabrics, are 
unique or very few in the country. Such a substantial 
industrial foundation should be regarded as a great advantage, 
not a burden. This advantage should be fully developed when we 
transform the old industrial base. We should make the best of 
enterprises' available assets to carry out more technical 
transformation projects and fewer capital construction projects. 
This is an effective way to yield quicker and greater results 
with less investment. We should pay particular attention to the 
technical transformation of large- and medium-sized enterprises 
and enable them to be fully invigorated and play a leading and 
promoting role in Heilongjiang's economic development. 
  We do not mean to rule out development of new capital 
construction projects when we advocate more transformation 
projects for the existing enterprises and less capital 
construction. Heilongjiang has long failed to address its 
irrational product mix, large proportion of important means of 
production, and a large loss of efficiency. To change such a 
situation, we should build a number of key projects focusing on 
the intensive processing of such resources as oil, coal, and 
timber that can lead relevant industries and support rapid 
economic development. However, either in technical 
transformation or capital construction, we should conduct a 
serious study of the market, do a good job in scientific 
appraisal, accurately select projects, and make sure that 
products are marketable and investment can be recalled within a 
short period after the projects are completed. We should never 
spend money to buy a burden. 
  In technical transformation, we should emphasize 
"technology." To transform the old industrial base, we should 
rely on scientific and technological advances and use high and 
new technology to transform traditional industries. As has been 
proven in the practice of modern production, the development and 
change of productive forces, the evolution of industries, the 
improvement of the standing of products, the optimal 
organization of enterprises' essential elements of production, 
and the effective regulation of production process are all 
decided by the scientific and technological advances, especially 
the infiltration, radiation, and influence of high and new 
technology in traditional industries. Over the past few years, 
Heilongjiang has established a number of high- and 
new-technology industrial development zones and science and 
technology parks and has developed and initially industrialized 
a number of electronic information technology, automation 
technology, bioengineering technology, new materials, and other 
high- and new-technology achievements. All localities should 
make the best of the role of these development zones and parks 
as "incubators" to distribute high- and new-technology 
achievements, scientific and technological policies, and 
operating mechanisms to promote the transformation of 
traditional industries. 
  Sufficient investment is needed in transforming the old 
industrial base. Shortages of funds constitute a major factor 
restricting Heilongjiang's transformation of the old industrial 
base. To solve this problem, we should rely on our own efforts. 
After financial allocations are changed into loans, neither 
local authorities nor enterprises can expect the state or the 
province to allocate funds to develop projects. They can only 
use their own funds or bank loans. Enterprises should use most 
parts of their retained profits in technical transformation and 
continuously snowball their funds for technical transformation. 
When conditions permit, they may also accelerate the 
depreciation of their fixed assets in line with relevant state 
policies and use the increased depreciation funds chiefly in 
technical transformation. It is a feasible way to use the funds 
and advanced technology from outside the border to renovate old 
enterprises and build joint ventures and exclusively 
foreign-funded enterprises whose technology is advanced and 
products are readily marketable. Heilongjiang is located at the 
center of the Northeast Asian economic circle and neighbors 
Russia, which has abundant resources and great market potential. 
Its major cities and localities have established economic and 
technological development zones or high- and new-technology 
development zones, and some of them have also been designated by 
the state as border open cities or pilot cities for overall 
reform, which enjoy almost the same policies as coastal open 
cities and very great advantages in opening up. Last year, 
Heilongjiang brought in 230 million yuan from abroad, accounting 
for 50 percent of the total amount brought in after border 
cities were opened to the outside. Even so, the capital brought 
in from abroad last year accounted for less than 1 percent of 
the total of the country. This means that we have great 
potential to tap. 
  While transforming the old industrial base with our own 
efforts, we should actively strive for state support. Entrusted 
by Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji led 
responsible comrades of relevant state ministries and 
commissions to conduct investigation and study in Heilongjiang. 
During that period, he helped the province address a series of 
difficulties and problems, including those on the projects, 
funds, and policies concerning the transformation of the old 
industrial base. All localities and departments should seize 
the opportunity to work in a down-to-earth manner and 
realistically transform the old industrial base to enable it to 
regain magnificence.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Wang Tonghui, deputy director </F>
of the Jilin Provincial Restructuring Committee, on 
standardizing and developing the shareholding system by 
reporters Li Zhihua (2621 1807 5478) and Jiang Yunshan (1203 
0061 3790)] 
  [Text] Question [Q]: Is it necessary to carry out the 
shareholding system under the current situation of reforming the 
enterprise property rights system? 
  Answer [A]: The reform in the preceding stage was only a 
policy readjustment characterized by delegating power and 
conceding benefits. The enthusiasm mobilized through this 
reform was limited. Simultaneously, this reform also brought 
about some short-term activities and some other problems. 
Enterprises had no effective mechanisms for restriction of 
property rights because state-owned assets lacked definite 
personified representatives. The fundamental way for solving 
these problems is to reform the enterprise property right system 
and to set up a modern enterprise system. Carrying out the 
shareholding system among state-owned enterprises is an 
important form to set up the modern enterprise system as well as 
a fundamental orientation for deepening the enterprise reform. 
Through the implementation of the shareholding system, we can 
not only collect funds for enterprises to make development but 
also help change the enterprise managerial mechanism. 
  Q: What targets shall we attain by setting up the modern 
enterprise system? 
  A: The targets that we will attain by setting up the modern 
enterprise system are as follows: First, the relations of 
property rights will be clear. The state-owned assets of 
enterprises belong to the state. Enterprises possess the 
property rights of the whole legal persons which are composed of 
the investors, including the state. Second, enterprises with 
the property owned by the whole legal persons will be 
independent for management, assume sole responsibility for 
profits or losses, pay taxes according to regulations, and hold 
themselves responsible to the investors in guaranteeing and 
increasing the assets. Investors enjoy the rights and interests 
of owners according to the amounts of the investment they have 
made. Third, the system of separating government functions from 
enterprise management will be carried out. Fourth, an 
enterprise leadership system and an organizational managerial 
system will be set up. A managerial mechanism of linking 
encouragement with restriction should take shape. 
  Q: What achievements and experiences has our province made 
and gained in carrying out the shareholding system? 
  A: In 1993, our province had 535 shareholding enterprises 
(excluding shareholding cooperative enterprises,) an increase of 
640 percent over the figure in 1992; 135 limited companies, an 
increase of 575 percent; and 400 limited liability companies, an 
increase of 670 percent. The value of shares totaled 15.847 
billion yuan, an increase of 487 percent over the figure in 
1992. By carrying out the shareholding system, enterprises 
collected more than four billion yuan of funds from society 
(excluding the shareholders as legal persons.) Our province is 
among the best in the whole country in terms of the number of 
shareholding enterprises and the value of total shares. 
  The newly organized shareholding enterprises have high 
enthusiasm and more flexible managerial mechanisms. These 
enterprises are full of vitality and become more prosperous by 
bringing into play the advantages of independent management and 
sufficient capital. The investigations on 100 enterprises made 
by a provincial-level organ last July showed that only 10 
percent of the enterprises were full of vitality and three types 
of foreign-funded enterprises, town and township enterprises, 
and shareholding enterprises accounted for a larger proportion. 
Practice showed that the shareholding system has advantages. 
The shareholding system, as a kind of managerial mechanism, 
has a long-standing history. However, it has been regarded as a 
form of the modern enterprise system in China only for several 
years. In a sense, the shareholding system is comparatively 
strange to us in terms of theory and practice. Through the 
practice over the past years, we have made some theoretical 
breakthroughs, gained some experiences, grasped some things of 
regularity, and created some new ways for changing the 
managerial mechanism. 
  Q: Do you think any problems exist in the trial 
implementation of the shareholding system? 
  A: First, the shareholding rights are set up in a plural and 
complicated way. There are shares held by the state, legal 
persons, the masses in society, and the staff and workers of 
enterprises as well as A-shares, B-shares, and H-shares. But, 
the shareholders with the same amounts of shares are not 
guaranteed to enjoy the same rights, gain the same profits, run 
the same risks, and assume the same responsibilities. All this 
affects the normal operation of the stock markets and the 
shareholding system. Second, speaking from a macroeconomic 
point of view, we know that the stock markets throughout the 
country have a limited capacity. Speaking from a microeconomic 
point of view, we know that supply exceeds demand on the stock 
markets. The stock markets are slump, and the stock price 
levels fall. All this is not well coordinated with the national 
economic development situation, enterprises' achievements, and 
the price hike tendency. 
  The people ideologically pay more 
attention speculation to the neglect of investment. Therefore, 
speculation activities exist in the deals on stock markets. 
But, we must regard the long- and medium-term investment as the 
foundation and take the industrial policies into consideration. 
3. We pay excessively more attention to the collection of funds 
to the neglect of the change of managerial mechanisms. 4. 
Viewing the overall situation, we know that the legislative 
stagnation affects the sound development of the stock markets 
and the shareholding system. 5. There are no sufficient 
talented persons with the ability in standardizing the operation 
of the shareholding system and publicly distributing stocks. 
  Q: What plans for the trial implementation of the 
shareholding system does the province have in 1994? 
  A: In 1994, we should put the trial implementation of the 
shareholding system in the overall situation of setting up the 
modern enterprise system and the socialist market economic 
system, standardize the system strictly according to the "law 
governing companies," develop it in the course of 
standardization, and standardize it in the course of development. 
  Specifically speaking, we should consolidate and improve 
limited companies (including the companies whose shares are 
listed,) positively develop limited liability companies, and 
vigorously carry out the shareholding system. 
  1. We should conscientiously sum up the experiences in 
carrying out the shareholding system on a trial basis gained in 
the preceding stage and conscientiously examine the situation in 
the operation of the limited companies where reform has been 
carried out so as to standardize these companies and set up 
brand-new shareholding enterprise management and operation 
mechanisms; with the focus on defining the limits of duties and 
the work procedures for boards of directors, boards of 
supervisors, shareholders congresses, general managers, party 
committees, and trade unions; and to make the shareholding 
enterprises be worthy of the name. 2. It is necessary to carry 
out, on a trial basis, the system where enterprises' property is 
"owned by the state and the property rights are wholly sold to 
the enterprises themselves." We should start from balancing the 
relations of property rights to establish main operators for the 
management of state-owned assets. According to the forms of 
"state ownership and commissioned management" and "state 
ownership and enterprise management," we should establish 
limited liability companies with the "rights to management of 
state-owned property." 3. We should carry out the shareholding 
cooperative management system. On the basis of checking up on 
assets, evaluating assets, and defining property rights and 
according to the standards for the shareholding system, we 
should conduct reform among collective enterprises and some 
small state-owned enterprises. The assets of former enterprises 
are converted into stocks according to relevant regulations, 
staff members and workers are allowed to be shareholders, and 
new enterprise organizational system and new managerial entities 
should be set up so that enterprises will become new managers 
that assume responsibility for their own profits, run risks, and 
undertake limited responsibilities. 4. The departments 
concerned under the governments should positively attend to the 
setup of intermediate organizations and provide high-quality 
service for stock markets and the shareholding system. 5. We 
should strengthen theoretical research and media propaganda on 
stock markets and the shareholding system, cultivate skilled 
persons, accurately give guidance, and ensure the smooth 
development of stock markets and the shareholding system.

  [Text] Since the beginning of this year, the province's 
commercial reform has proceeded rapidly with a good result. 
According to statistics, 7 enterprises have newly experimented 
with the shareholding system, with the total number of 
experimental enterprises reaching 40, of which, 23 have 
experimented with the system of the limited liability stock 
company, 9 have experimented with the system of the limited 
liability corporation, and 8 have experimented with the system 
of the shareholding cooperative corporation. Meanwhile, a total 
of 813 enterprises have carried out the system of being owned by 
the state but operated by the people, a total of 25 enterprise 
groups have been organized, 305 corporations have been 
established as single entities, and 607 enterprises have been 
leased, sold, and merged to others or have gone bankrupt. 
  According to a survey, the province's commercial reform has 
the following characteristics: First, the reform is diversified 
in forms. Various localities have suited their measures to 
local conditions rather than rigidly adhering to a certain form. 
Second, the reform has proceeded rapidly. In some localities, 
the number of enterprises carrying out the system of being owned 
by the state but operated by the people and the enterprises 
organized as corporations have approached or surpassed the 
targets approved by the province for the fiscal year. Third, 
the reform has yielded good results. Most of the enterprises 
carrying out the shareholding system have effected substantial 
increases in sales, profits, and tax payment. Most enterprises 
implementing the system of being owned by the state but operated 
by the people have effected a turn for the better in economic 
efficiency, and more than half of such enterprises have made 
their circulating assets withdrawn. At the same time, many good 
exemplary enterprises have come to the fore.

<F P=106> [By John Kohut in Yanji, Jilin Province] </F>
  [Text] Anti-government demonstrations in Tibet and 
Beijing's ever simmering troubles with its Muslim population in 
Xinjiang have focused world attention on the resentment China's 
national minorities feel towards their Han Chinese masters. 
  Yet, in the annals of China's handling of its 55 ethnic 
minorities, there do seem to be a few success stories, and one 
of them is in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in the 
country's northeast bordering Russia and North Korea. 
  "Sometimes there are conflicts. In such cases, they lean 
towards their people and we lean towards ours. But there aren't 
any major conflicts," said a plump Han Chinese fortune teller in 
Yanji, the seat of the prefectural government. "The Koreans are 
smart and work hard and they do well," said the woman, who works 
alongside an ethnic Korean. 
  Perhaps there is more friction than immediately meets the 
eye. But, in contrast to many other parts of China where 
minorities readily approach foreigners to recount bitter tales 
of what they describe as Han repression, there are few signs of 
racial tension here. And if statistics are anything to judge 
by, then it seems that the Koreans of Yanbian, who account for 
840,000 of the prefecture's 2.14 million population and half of 
the ethnic Koreans in China, have been doing well -- in fact, 
better than the local Han Chinese. 
  Officials say this success is due to Beijing's national 
minorities' policy. But the reason why that policy has failed 
elsewhere and worked relatively well here may have to do with 
the Koreans themselves. For one, an historic affinity between 
Korean and Chinese culture makes for fewer conflicts. 
  An obsession with education -- a Korean saying has it that 
families will give up their oxen and fields to send a child to 
school -- is said to be a major reason for the upward mobility 
of ethnic Koreans in China. "Our tradition emphasizes 
education," said Jin Zhongguo, an ethnic Korean who heads the 
Yanbian Nationalities Affairs Committee. "If there is a 
parent-teacher meeting, all Korean parents will show up. In 
contrast, only half of the Han will attend. If you ask families 
to donate 100 yuan (Hong Kong $88) each to their children's 
school, no Korean will give anything less than that, while Han 
parents will give only 10 yuan." 
  Koreans perform much better than the Han in education. There 
are 304 college graduates for every 10,000 Koreans, twice the 
national average. A high proportion of Koreans attend top 
universities such as Beida and Qinghua. 
  Seventy percent of the students, 70 percent of instructors, 
and 80 percent of administrators at Yanbian University, the 
prefecture's most prestigious school, are Korean. 
  As with other minority regions, the prefectural party boss 
is 
Han while the head of local government is selected from the 
minority population. (Unlike many of his counterpart's in other 
minority areas, Yanbian's party supremo, Zhang Dejiang, does 
speak the minority language, as do almost a sixth of the Han who 
live here.) 
  Koreans account for 40 percent of Yanbian's population, but 
constitute 60 percent of the prefecture's delegates to the 
National People's Congress, and 56 percent of prefectural 
officialdom. 
  At political meetings, the main language is Korean, with 
translation into Chinese. All road and shop signs are in both 
languages. 
  Ten of Yanbian's 11 art groups focus on Korean culture, 12 
of 
the 16 locally published magazines appear in the Korean 
language, and 10 of the 14 local newspapers are in Korean. 
There are radio and television broadcasts in both Korean and 
Chinese. Of Yanbian's five universities and colleges, four 
teach courses in the Korean language. 
  In family planning, the Koreans have a lower birth rate than 
the Han.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Wei (1728 5633): "Invigorating Large and </F>
Medium-Sized Enterprises Is an Important Task of the Entire 
Province"] 
  [Excerpts] On the morning of 1 May, Gu Jinchi, secretary of 
the provincial party committee; Wen Shizhen, deputy secretary of 
the provincial party committee and executive vice governor; and 
other leaders of the provincial departments concerned went to 
Benxi Iron and Steel Company to salute workers on the forefront 
of production and to inspect the cold rolling project with a 
total investment of 2.5 billion yuan and the construction site 
of 800 bloomers for producing special steel. 
  As soon as they got out of the car, Gu Jinchi and Wen 
Shizhen 
put on working clothes and safety helmets and went directly to 
the No. 2 steelmaking furnace to cordially shake hands with 
workers on the forefront of production and ask them about their 
production and living conditions. They also traveled to the 
control room and to the cold rolling project design and 
construction site to examine the installation of the 800 
bloomers for producing special steel. In the afternoon, Gu 
Jinchi and Wen Shizhen listened to a briefing given by Zhang 
Wenda, chief manager of Benxi Iron and Steel Company. After 
listening to the briefing, Wen Shizhen said: Although the 
industrial output value of Benxi Iron and Steel Company 
increased by 5.2 percent during this year's first quarter 
compared with the corresponding period last year, and the 
profits and taxes dropped by a large margin compared with the 
same period last year, its situation is quite grim. At present, 
invigorating state-owned enterprises, particularly state-owned 
large and medium-sized enterprises, is an important task facing 
the entire province. [passage omitted] 
  In his summing-up speech, Gu Jinchi expressed the hope that 
Benxi Iron and Steel Company, which is a "pillar" enterprise, 
should change its planned economic system into the market 
economic system as quickly as possible, regard the study of 
market situation as the basis of all work and let the domestic 
and foreign markets decide the categories and quantity of 
products it should produce. He said: We should define the 
product orientation through the study of markets and determine 
the technical transformation targets in line with the product 
orientation. He pointed out: The key to carrying out our 
province's "second pioneering program" lies in two points. 
First, we must see whether enterprises can successfully change 
from the planned economy into the market economy; and second, we 
must use high and new technology to transform traditional 
industries. We can gain a firm footing and give play to our 
advantages only when we are able to produce products which other 
medium and small enterprises as well as township enterprises 
cannot produce. 
  Gu Jinchi stressed: Enterprises should clearly understand 
that they should regard economic efficiency as the central task. 
He said: Our province once had the splendor of being placed 
among the front rank of the country in economic returns. At 
present, the efficiency norms are not worth mentioning. 
Regardless of what project we carry out, it will not do if we 
can only make over 10 percent of profits from it because this 
can only allow us to barely repay the bank interest. 
  Gu Jinchi pointed out: Enterprise management must be strict. 
Over the past few years, there were many new terms for 
enterprise management. Actually, how much have we enhanced the 
level of enterprise management? At present, the phenomenon of 
lax management is quite serious in some enterprises. If we 
allow this situation to continue, we will have endless trouble 
in the future. 
  Gu Jinchi reaffirmed: Enterprises must persist in regarding 
personnel as the foundation. It is necessary to strengthen 
cadres' ideological work, establish a strong rank of workers and 
staff members, and turn them into the main forces for realizing 
all targets of enterprises. He hoped that Benxi Iron and Steel 
Company, which once made major contributions to the development 
of the country, will continue to take the lead in today's 
process of building the socialist market economic structure and 
will provide good experiences for the entire province.

<F P=106> [Letter from Zhang Jun (1728 6511), staffer of the Chaoyang </F>
County Supply and Marketing Cooperative--date not given] 
  [Text] Comrade editor: 
  The situation prevailing in the markets of means of 
agricultural production this spring is severe. Investigation 
and analysis data indicate that there are problems such as a 
shortage of resources for the business and means of sale in 
agricultural production, particular shortages in the business 
and the sale of fertilizer; price hikes of these productive 
means; and disorder in these markets. The means of agricultural 
production are the essential factors of production. Success or 
failure in running the business in this regard is directly 
affecting the basic role of agriculture. In order to stabilize 
the agricultural development and to protect peasants' interests, 
it is imperative for us to consolidate the markets of means of 
agricultural production and to conduct macro-economic control. 
  First, we should enhance the role of the business of means 
in 
agricultural production as the main channel of all sectors. 
Over many years, supply and marketing cooperatives at all 
levels have played an important role in ensuring the supply of 
means of agricultural production, in safeguarding peasants' 
interest, and in protecting agricultural production. After 
having relaxed the restrictions on the business of means in 
agricultural production, competitions in this regard have become 
intensified because the state, collectives, and individuals have 
joined in succession in the business. The decline of economic 
results and the shortage of funds are adversely affecting the 
capability of supply and marketing cooperatives in market 
competition and in purchasing, selling, and storing the 
commodities of these productive means. However, the 
self-employed businessmen in this area who join in the 
transaction in the busy season and quit their business in the 
slack season, have jostled the normal operation of markets in 
this regard. They have made the departments in charge of 
supplying the means of agricultural production unable to 
estimate market capacity and demands, severely emphasized the 
role of supply and marketing cooperatives in being the main 
channel of all economic sectors, and imposed a shadow on the 
feeling of the broad masses of peasants. 
  Second, we should consolidate the chaotic order in the 
markets of means of agricultural production. A number of 
falsified and sub-standard means of agricultural production have 
flooded in the markets due to increasingly intensified market 
competition and interference caused by abnormal competition. 
All of these have brought harm to peasants, hindered 
agricultural production, led to a chaotic order in the business 
of means of agricultural production and in the prices and 
quality of these productive means, and severely damaged the 
interests of peasants. Departments in charge of enforcing the 
law at all levels should resolutely check the business without a 
license and strictly handle the cases of illegal purchase and 
sales and the cases committed by those who are marketing the 
falsified and sub-standard commodities in this regard. At the 
same time, supply and marketing cooperative at all levels should 
enhance the organization of goods sources; engage in legal 
operation; keep the commodity prices stable; vigorously 
stabilize the markets of means of agricultural production; and 
meet the demands of agricultural production. 
  Third, we should promote the establishment of a service 
network for the supply of means to agricultural production. The 
chaotic markets of means of agricultural production have enabled 
the business and sale of fertilizer to go out of control and 
will undoubtedly lead to a loss of guarantee in supplies that 
adversely affect production. The business of means of 
agricultural production is strongly seasonal and these 
productive means can enjoy brisk sales as soon as the busy 
season comes. In order to enhance the capability of readjusting 
and controlling the markets of means of agricultural production, 
we should reconsider the main channel role played by the supply 
and marketing cooperatives and provide preferential policies for 
the supply of business and marketing cooperatives. At the same 
time, these cooperatives should continuously deepen the reform 
in the operation and management of their business in this 
regard. They should also regard companies dealing in the means 
of agricultural production as a firm leader and the grass-roots 
cooperatives in rural areas as support, bring into play the 
strong points of mass communities, broaden the network and 
centers of purchase and sales, and actively promote the 
popularization of the service network for supplying and 
marketing these agricultural productive means.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (AFP) -- China confirmed Thursday 
that it had agreed to visits by technicians from the Voice of 
America (VOA) to discuss alleged Chinese jamming of broadcasts 
by the U.S. radio network. The move is an apparent concession 
to U.S. President Bill Clinton who made the cessation of radio 
jamming by the Chinese authorities one of the conditions for 
renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status with the 
United States. 
  "The Chinese side has agreed with the U.S. side to send 
technicians to China to talk about technical matters, such as 
the question of overlapping frequencies," Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin said. However, he stressed that China did 
not jam VOA broadcasts and dismissed any linkage of the issue 
with the MFN debate. "There is no such thing as the jamming of 
VOA by China," Wu said. "The study of the technical problem of 
broadcasting frequency overlapping by the experts from the two 
sides, has nothing to do with MFN trade status," he added. 
  Clinton must make a decision on MFN renewal by June 3. 
According to a U.S. embassy official, one technician has 
already arrived in Beijing and will soon begin discussions with 
Chinese colleagues "to review information concerning possible 
interference with VOA radio signals." VOA has repeatedly 
accused the Chinese of interfering with their broadcast 
frequencies, specifically those used by the network's Chinese 
service. Beijing is especially sensitive to the issue of 
foreign broadcasts and has reacted angrily to U.S. plans to set 
up a "Radio Free Asia", broadcasting into China and other Asian 
countries. China says the plan is an attempt by the United 
States to sow confusion and discord in the region.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman today described as "sheer fabrication" the 
assertion that China is continuing to export prison labor 
products to the United States. 
  Spokesman Wu Jianmin made the remarks at a weekly news 
briefing here this afternoon when asked to comment on the report 
that on may 18, Wu Hongda and U.S. Congressman Smith asserted 
that China is continuing to export prison labor products (PLPs) 
to the U.S. 
  "This is sheer fabrication," Wu said. 
  With regard to export of PLPs, China and the U.S. have 
signed 
the memorandum of understanding (MOU) on prohibiting import and 
export trade in PLPs. China has acted in strict compliance with 
the MOU, he said. 
  Not long ago, China and the U.S. also signed a statement on 
cooperation for the implementation of the MOU, Wu said. 
  Both Chinese and U.S. sides share the view that the two 
documents are being implemented smoothly, he noted. 
  "It is out of ulterior motives for a handful of people to 
spread lies and make vicious slanders on this issue," the 
spokesman said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (AFP) -- China warned the United 
States Thursday not to attach any conditions to renewal of its 
MFN status, saying such an action would have an "adverse 
influence" on bilateral ties. A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman 
said most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status was "a reciprocal 
and a mutually beneficial trade arrangement." "Any move which 
runs counter to this will undermine the foundation for the 
economic and trade relations between the two countries and will 
have adverse influences on Sino-U.S. relations," she said. 
  The comments followed confirmation by a senior U.S. official 
Wednesday that Washington may settle for imposing limited 
sanctions on Beijing to express displeasure over its human 
rights record, rather than carrying out its threat to withdraw 
China's MFN status. China has consistently condemned U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's 1993 decision to make "significant 
overall progress" in human rights a condition for this year's 
renewal of MFN. Clinton must make a decision on the issue by 
June 3. U.S. businessmen, who have invested some eight billion 
dollars in China, have warned the President that even attaching 
conditions could draw a visceral response from Beijing. 
  Foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said China had taken 
note of support from U.S. businessmen, congressmen and 
journalists for the unconditional renewal of MFN, saying this 
was a "positive" development. "We hope the United States 
government will make a sensible decision," he told a weekly news 
briefing. He said the two sides seek to resolve their 
differences through dialogue on a equal footing, indicating that 
there was in any case only so much Beijing could do to satisfy 
Washington. "The U.S. can only do what is permitted by its 
laws. The same is true of China. China can only do what is 
permitted by China's laws," Wu said. He said it would be 
"inappropriate" to give details of any ongoing diplomacy, but 
added that "the channels for contact between the two countries 
are always in place.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The Taiwan authorities' 
intention of creating "two Chinas" and their attempt for 
accepting "dual recognition" go against the overall interests of 
the Chinese nation and will end in failure, said a Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman here today. 
  The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, made the remarks at the weekly 
press conference here this afternoon. 
  On may 17, Fredrick F. Chien claimed in Taiwan's 
"Legislative 
Yuan" that Taiwan was prepared to accept South Africa's dual 
recognition of the two sides across the Taiwan straits. 
  Wu said, this is yet another ploy of the Taiwan authorities 
aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in 
disregard of the overall interests of the Chinese nation. 
  He noted that it is a fact recognized by the United Nations 
and the international community at large that there is only one 
China in the world, the government of the People's Republic of 
China is the sole legal government representing the whole of 
China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. 
  "It is on this basis that China has established diplomatic 
relations with 158 countries in the world," said Wu. 
  "It is futile for the Taiwan authorities to try to end 
Taiwan's isolation in the world by way of 'dual recognition'", 
he said. "the only right choice is for them to go along with the 
historical tide by helping bring about national reunification at 
an early date." 
  The Chinese Government appreciates the position of South 
African President Mandela and the African National Congress to 
pursue a one- China policy and their pledge to address their 
relations with China in accordance with the practice of the 
United Nations and other international organizations, Wu said. 
  "We believe that the relations between China and the new 
South Africa will develop in an all-round way on the basis of 
the five principles of peaceful coexistence," said the spokesman.

  [Text] Beijing, May 18 (AFP)--Beijing moved quickly 
Wednesday to rule out any possibility of South Africa extending 
dual recognition to China and Taiwan. "We are against any form 
of dual recognition," a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
  In a major policy switch, Taiwan said Tuesday that it would 
not seek to cut official ties with South Africa if Pretoria 
switches diplomatic recognition to Beijing. 
  The announcement by Foreign Minister Frederick Chan marked 
the first time Taiwan had indicated it would be prepared to 
tolerate dual recognition with China. However, the Chinese 
spokesman was adamant such an arrangement would be unacceptable 
to Beijing. "We firmly oppose any attempt aimed at creating two 
Chinas, or one China one Taiwan," he said. 
  China refuses to permit countries with which it has 
diplomatic relations to recognise Taiwan, which it has regarded 
as a renegade province ever since Nationalist forces fled to the 
island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists on the 
mainland. Similarly, Taipei has previously broken ties with any 
country which switches formal recognition to Beijing. 
  Beijing and South Africa's new government of national unity 
are widely expected to establish diplomatic relations later this 
year. China, a long-time supporter of the black majority's 
struggle for political rights in South Africa, had previously 
refused to establish ties with the white government in Pretoria 
until the country's apartheid system had been completely 
dismantled. "We believe that relations between China and the 
new South Africa will enjoy all-round development in the 
future," the spokesman said. 
  In October last year, China resumed economic and trade links 
with South Africa which were suspended in 1960. 
  Taiwan currently maintains official ties with only 29 
countries, including South Africa, but has in recent years 
launched a diplomatic offensive -- especially in Southeast Asia 
-- to cement ties with other governments.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (AFP) -- China on Wednesday denied 
as "groundless" reports that a law suit had been filed against 
Wei Jingsheng, saying the country's most famous dissident was 
under surveillance. "Wei Jingsheng is now under surveillance," 
foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said at a weekly press 
briefing. "He remains under surveillance, but to allege that a 
law suit has been filed against him is totally groundless," said 
Wu. 
  Although the English translation of Wu's remarks suggested 
that no suit would be brought in the future, the spokesman 
subsequently made clear he was talking only about "now" and 
declined to elaborate. 
  The public security ministry issued a denial Wednesday of a 
western press report that it had announced a formal decision to 
try Wei and had handed the case over to the courts. The foreign 
ministry also denied Wednesday separate reports that China was 
preparing to file treason charges against the 44-year-old 
dissident, who was released from prison in September just six 
months short of a 15-year sentence for "counter-revolutionary" 
crimes.

  The spokesman made the statement when asked to comment on 
the 
report that the Chinese Judicial Department is prosecuting Wei

sentence of 10 to 15 years imprisonment. 
  "Our information from the departments concerned shows that

  [Text] Damascus, May 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher left here this afternoon for Egypt, winding 
up his visit to Syria in a shuttle diplomacy to expedite the 
peace process. 
  Christopher, who arrived here from Tel Aviv earlier today, 
held talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on ways of 
bringing closer the viewpoints of Syria and Israel to narrow 
their differences over restoring Syria's Golan Heights. 
  Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' and U.S. Middle East 
peace coordinator Dennis Ross attended the talks. 
  Diplomatic sources here said that Christopher is shuttling 
between Israel and Syria to seek common ground and help iron out 
hurdles still on the way to peace. 
  The sources said that the talks Christopher had in Tel Aviv 
Tuesday [17 May] and in Damascus today have not made tangible 
headway in bringing their differences closer. 
  Christopher, who did not give a press briefing on his talks, 
was seen off by al-Shar' at the airport. 
  Syria's presidential spokesman Jibran Kourieh [name as 
received] said after Christopher's departure that "the 
differences remained wide." 
  "The president reiterated Syria's position and its adherence 
to the basis of the peace process in accordance with U.N. 
Security Council resolutions which call on Israel to fully 
withdraw" from territories occupied in 1967," Kourieh said.

  [Text] Cairo, May 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher arrived here tonight on a brief visit to 
Egypt. 
  Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he had held good 
and 
constructive talks with Syrian and Israeli officials. 
  He said that during the talks he discussed with them several 
proposals for making headway on the Syrian-Israeli track of the 
Middle East peace negotiations. 
  He voiced optimism despite some difficult points which have 
to be discussed further between the two parties. He explained 
that the two sides have divergent views as well as convergent 
ones, saying, "we will continue talks for making progress on all 
tracks for a settlement." 
  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa of Egypt, who was on hand to 
welcome his U.S. counterpart, said that Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak will later tonight meet Christopher on the outcome of 
his shuttle between Syria and Israel. 
  The U.S. official has been touring the Middle East region in 
the past two days, bringing into sharper focus the need to 
bridge the difference of the viewpoints between Syria and Israel 
in a bid to get the peace drive off the ground again, and making 
new offers to both countries. 
  During Christopher's last trip to the region for peace 
between Syria and Israel, Israel offered Syria a withdrawal plan 
to be completed within eight years without committing to a full 
withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights. 
  However, Syria has insisted on a full Israeli withdrawal to 
be completed within a period of three years. 
  Israel has been criticizing Syria for not clearly expounding 
the concept of peace it demands.

  [Text] Cairo, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak today asserted the importance of resuming the Middle 
East peace talks till peace is established. 
  Speaking at a press conference he gave here together with 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Mubarak said the 
U.S. official had briefed him on efforts made over the past two 
days during his talks with Syrian and Israeli officials. 
  "We are working along with the U.S. for settling the Syrian- 
Israeli problem," he added. 
  On the situation in Yemen, Mubarak said that he had warned 
against resorting to force. "Force will not solve any problem," 
he stressed. 
  In a speech delivered at the beginning of the press 
conference, Mubarak said that both Syria and Israel are badly in 
need of establishing peace. "Time has come to solve any 
outstanding problems hindering establishing peace between the 
two countries," he noted. 
  Christopher, who arrived here earlier today, spoke highly of 
Egypt's role in the Middle East peace process. He also said 
Syria has an important role to play in the process. 
  The U.S. official said he had conveyed Israeli views to 
Syria 
on settling their disputes, and is waiting for a solution 
acceptable to both sides. 
  Christopher is on his third Middle East shuttle since 
December. 
  Syria and Israel have exchanged proposals for a 
land-for-peace deal. Under the formula, Israel should withdraw 
from the Golan Heights it occupied in the 1967 Middle East war 
in return for recognition, peace and guaranteed security from 
Syria. Issues of dispute between the two sides include the 
timing of the withdrawal, security guarantees, the fate of 
13,000 Jewish settlers in the Golan, and normalization of 
relations under a peace treaty.

  [Text] Washington, May 18 (XINHUA) -- More than 100 U.S. 
House members wrote to President Clinton Tuesday asking him to 
unconditionally renew China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trade 
status. 
  A letter signed by 106 members of the House of 
Representatives called for the creation of a joint human rights 
commission as "a constructive and effective alternative to what 
has become the annual confrontation over renewal of China's MFN 
status." 
  The letter was signed by members of both Democratic and 
Republican parties, including Lee Hamilton (D), chairman of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee, Sam Gibbons (D), chairman of 
the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade, House minority leader 
Bob Michel (R) and Minority whip Newt Gingrich (R). 
  The letter said, "We have grown increasingly concerned that 
the multilevel policy of engagement with China is now being 
viewed by many primarily in terms of human rights,... we must 
pursue policies specific to each of the issues which divide us 
and offer a realistic chance of positive results." 
  Jim McDermott, one of the sponsors of the letter and 
chairman 
of a bi-partisan task force on U.S.-China policy, said that they 
believed the best way for the United States to influence the 
human rights situation in China is "through honest dialogue, not 
through empty rhetoric, threats and public posturing." 
  Jim Lightfoot (R), the other sponsor of the letter and a 
member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign 
Operations, said that as the June 3 deadline for renewing MFN is 
fast approaching, "we believe this is the time to advance an 
approach that is pro- jobs, pro-human rights and in the interest 
of our national security."

  [Text] Washington, May 18 (XINHUA) -- President Clinton 
should use his decision on renewal of most-favored-nation [MFN] 
status to unlink it from human rights conditionality and define 
a new policy toward China, a policy report suggests. 
  The report, entitled "Starting Over: From MFN to a China 
Policy for the Future," was released here today by the 
Progressive Policy Institute, a major think-tank of the 
Democratic Party. It outlines a strategy that "calls for 
engagement, not isolation; patience, not instant gratification; 
subtlety, not confrontation." 
  The premise of his report is, as its author Robert Manning, 
a 
senior fellow of the policy institute, put it, that "linking 
China's MFN status to human rights is counterproductive to our 
national goals." "President Clinton has a rare opportunity to 
re-establish a bipartisan consensus for a sensible post-cold war 
China policy by unlinking MFN renewal from particular human 
rights issues," the report says. 
  The report regards MFN as being "simply too blunt an 
instrument to define U.S. relations with China." "We must find 
ways to engage China across a broader spectrum,... strategic and 
economic issues top priorities [as received] and should dictate 
how trade-offs occur," it says. 
  The report points out that denial of MFN status to China 
would have seriously negative effects for the United States as 
well as China, such as undermining Sino-American cooperation on 
vital security issues, severely damaging U.S.-China trade 
relationship, endangering U.S. competitiveness in a rapidly 
growing economy and isolating the United States itself. 
  The policy recommendations offered by the report include: 
severing MFN renewal from human rights conditions, negotiating 
an arrangement with Congress to repeal the Jackson-Vanik 
Amendment and creating a U.S.-China bilateral human rights 
commission.

<F P=106> [By Chan Wai-Fong] </F>
  [Text] Four Shanghai magazine editors have been repeatedly 
harassed by security officials for the past month apparently to 
curb "reactionary" activities in the run-up to the fifth 
anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen bloody crackdown. 
  They are poet Chen Dongdong, writer Sun Ganlu, and scholars 
Chen Zishan and Zhu Dake. All are editors of the cultural 
magazine Tendency Quarterly, founded in the United States and 
Hong Kong in November. 
  Chinese authorities have been keeping a close eye on the 
quarterly which was founded by Bei Ling, an American-based 
Chinese poet who took part in the famed Democracy Wall movement 
in the late 1970s. 
  Mr Bei was reportedly interrogated repeatedly by police and 
state-security agents in Shanghai and Shenzhen in January for 
publishing an "illegal journal" when he was about to return to 
the U.S. 
  One thousand copies of the first issue of Tendency 
Quarterly, 
carried by Mr Bei then, were seized by the Shenzhen authorities. 
  The quarterly has five mainland editors. The fifth, Meng 
Lang, left Shanghai in February. Mr Meng had been detained for 
two months by the Shanghai public security in 1992. 
  Mr Chen told the South China Morning Post that he had been 
interrogated six times by the Shanghai police since mid-April 
for his involvement in Tendency Quarterly. 
  "The interrogation usually lasted a few hours. And this was 
very troublesome," Mr Chen said, adding that not only were the 
editors questioned but also the contributors to the magazine. 
  "(The police) said that the Shenzhen authorities asked them 
to learn more about the magazine. They suggested that the 
magazine was liaising with the democracy movement in the West. 
  "But I told them this was not the case. They refused to 
believe me," Mr Chen said. 
  Speaking from Boston, Mr Bei said he was worried about the 
situation of the Shanghai-based editors, particularly Mr Chen 
who apparently had been questioned the most often. 
  "He sounded desperate the last time I talked to him. 
  "And Mr Sun was also deeply worried, fearing that his work 
as 
a contracted professional writer of the official Shanghai 
Writers' Association would be jeopardized," Mr Bei said. 
  He said his parents in Beijing were recently questioned by 
the police. "This was the first time in years that they had 
done such things. They asked them what I had been doing during 
my stay in Beijing during the end of 1993 and early 1994," he 
said. 
  He contended that the Chinese authorities, by intimidating 
these people, wanted to curb "reactionary" activities before the 
anniversary of the June 4 Tiananmen crackdown. 
  "(China) also wants to show the international community, 
especially the Americans, that China is not afraid of the 
pressure they have been trying to exert on it," Mr Bei said. 
  "I understand it is a sensitive magazine since a number of 
dissident writers are involved. But until now, no mainland 
editors have asked to resign," he said. 
  The second issue of Tendency Quarterly -- partly funded by 
an 
American foundation and with a board of editors consisting of 
writers in the U.S., Hong Kong and China -- is expected to be 
published next month. Mr Bei said that it would carry details 
of the harassment.

  [Text] Washington, May 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today ordered peacetime draft registration and the 
selective service system to be continued, said the White House. 
  "It is essential to our national security to continue draft 
registration and the selective service system (SSS)," Clinton 
wrote in letters to Congress, said White House spokeswoman Dee 
Dee Myers in a statement. 
  Clinton argued that the SSS and the registration provide "a 
hedge against unforeseen threats and a relatively low-cost 
`insurance policy' against our underestimating the maximum level 
of threat we expect our armed forces to face." 
  "Terminating the SSS and draft registration now could send 
the wrong signal to our potential enemies who are watching for 
signs of U.S. resolve," he warned. 
  He added that "it is increasingly important" to maintain the 
link between the all volunteer force and the U.S. society at 
large at a time when fewer and fewer people have direct military 
experience. 
  In January, Clinton ordered the National Security Council to 
review the policy. 
  The process involved representatives from the Office of the 
Secretary of State, the Pentagon inspector general and the 
Office of Management and Budget and SSS. 
  The decision, in effect, rejected a Pentagon conclusion 
earlier this year that ending draft registration would pose no 
risk to national security. 
  Clinton also urged lawmakers to support the administration's 
1995 budget request of 23 million dollars for the SSS.

  [Text] Washington, May 18 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today announced his plan to name three U.S. officials to 
be members of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe. 
  The nominees are John Shattuck, assistant secretary of 
defense for democracy, human rights and labor; Ashton Carter, 
assistant secretary of state for nuclear security and 
counter-proliferation and a former vice president of Harvard 
University; and Charles Meissner, assistant secretary of 
commerce for international economic policy, White House sources 
said. 
  Clinton also announced his plan to nominate Robert Pastor, a 
Latin American specialist at the Carter Center in Atlanta, to be 
U.S. ambassador to Panama. 
  Pastor, 47 and a university professor of political science, 
has been director of the center's Latin American and Caribbean 
program since 1986. 
  He has also served as executive secretary of the Council of 
Freely Elected Heads of Government, a group of 23 leaders in the 
Western Hemisphere, which has monitored elections in eight Latin 
American nations. 
  Pastor was director of Latin American and Caribbean affairs 
for the National Security Council during President Jimmy 
Carter's administration.

<F P=106> [From the "Morning News" program] </F>
  [Text] When interviewed recently at the Sino-U.S. symposium 
on antidumping issues, Zhang Yuqing, a division chief of the 
Treaty and Law Department under the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC], pointed out: Accusing China 
of dumping is apparently unfair. Because China's raw materials 
and labor are inexpensive, the costs of its export goods are 
accordingly low. Chief Zhang Yuqing also disclosed that the 
practice of certain foreign-trade businesses which compete to 
sell goods by cutting prices have seriously hurt the overall 
interests and [word indistinct] of China's exports. Here is a 
report filed yesterday by station reporter Ji Yuping: 
  [Begin recording] [Ji] The market economy is an economy 
based 
on the law. While this seems easy to understand, it is not so 
simple in practice. Zhang Yuqing, an official of the MOFTEC's 
Treaty and Law Department, maintains that many Chinese export 
businesses, in knowing very little about the trade laws of 
European countries and the United States, have been selling 
their goods by cutting prices unrealistically. When they are 
fined, they still do not know what they have done wrong. 
  [Zhang] Many factories and trade companies do not know that 
dumping is not permitted abroad. They do not understand why it 
is wrong to sell their goods very cheaply. They ask: Is it a 
mistake to sell our goods cheaply and that shoppers have 
benefited from low prices? They do not know that this is wrong. 
While the importing countries cannot stop our increasing 
exports, all they can do is label it as dumping and fight it 
accordingly. 
  [Ji] Most of the countries in the West are GATT members. 
According to GATT regulations, GATT members cannot control 
imports by increasing tariffs or the amount of required 
licenses, but they are allowed to fight dumping. According to 
statistics, in 1993 there were 37 cases in which foreign 
countries accused China of dumping. A large percentage of such 
goods are machinery, electronics goods, and textile products -- 
sectors which China has given priority to developing. 
Antidumping has seriously affected the growth of Chinese 
exports. According to Zhang Yuqing, when Chinese businesses in 
U.S. and European markets are accused of dumping, they often do 
not know what to do. Instead of contesting the charge, some 
simply withdraw from the markets. More often than not, 
antidumping accusations have side effects. They often hurt 
other Chinese businesses which operate according to regulations. 
  [Zhang] Ordinarily when we deal with an international trade 
dispute, we follow the rule that whoever violates the contract 
should bear the responsibilities. Rules for combating dumping 
are not identical. For example, once we have been accused of 
selling cups at dumping prices, other exporters which have never 
exported any cups will still be subjected to antidumping tariffs 
for many years when they want to export cups. 
  [Ji] In other words, when one business sells products 
inexpensively, it will also hurt many other exporters. In 
short, Chinese enterprises, both large and small, have very 
little understanding of European countries' and U.S. antidumping 
laws. It has been reported that once a Chinese business has 
been accused of dumping its goods in the United States, Japan 
and EC countries will also resort to the same sanctions 
measures, and the markets for Chinese exports thus will become 
smaller. MOFTEC data shows that some countries have time and 
again investigated whether China was dumping its traditional 
goods -- such as silicon carbide, bicycles, shoes -- in those 
countries; that antidumping tariffs have been imposed on these 
products; and that certain markets for China's export goods have 
been lost. 
  The MOFTEC official maintains that antidumping will become a 
major international trade issue in the future and that Chinese 
exporting businesses must do several things. First, they must 
thoroughly study relevant international regulations and rules. 
Second, they must stop competing between themselves by cutting 
prices. Third, they must export goods of a higher grade and 
better quality -- goods that they can sell profitably. [end

  [Text] Singapore, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China is no longer a 
centrally-planned economy as the market mechanism is now in the 
dominating position in the country's economic activities, 
China's Vice Premier Li Lanqing said here today. 
  In his keynote speech at the international conference "Waves 
of the Future - ASEAN, Vietnam and China: Opportunities for 
World Business," the Chinese vice premier told the 800-strong 
audience: "market mechanism has taken a leading position in the 
national economic activities" and China is now ready to better 
integrate its economy into the world economy as a whole." 
  "Market regulates 84 percent of the country's industrial 
activities, leaving 16 percent of the industrial goods subject 
to planned production and allocation," Li elaborated. 
  Of all agricultural product sales by farmers in China, 
mandatory plan covers only 12.5 percent, while of the total 
retail sales, only 5.9 percent is priced by the government, he 
added. 
  China's economic system has undergone significant changes, 
Li 
said, adding that a multi-form ownership pattern including state 
ownership, collective ownership, private ownership, individual 
ownership, foreign investors' ownership and common stock 
ownership, which are developing simultaneously with the state 
ownership as the mainstay, has taken shape in the country. 
  "Market mechanism has been playing an ever increasing role 
in 
allocating resources and providing growing impetus to the 
domestic economic development," he said. 
  Li Lanqing arrived here Wednesday night to attend the 
international conference jointly organized by the Asia Society, 
Dow Jones and Company, Inc., and the Institute of Policy Studies 
of Singapore. 
  He will also co-chair the inaugural joint steering council 
meeting on the Suzhou industrial township project on Friday.

  [Text] Singapore, May 19 (AFP) -- It would not be in the 
United States' interest to deny China its most favoured nation 
(MFN) status, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said here Thursday. 
  Responding to questions at a business conference, Li said: 
"MFN is mutually beneficial and the basis for our bilateral 
trading relationship. The granting of MFN status and 
preservation of MFN treatment is of fundamental interest to our 
two countries." 
  Li's comments came as reports from Washington suggested US 
President Bill Clinton was considering partial withdrawal of 
China's trading privileges. He must decide on his course of 
action by June 3. 
  Clinton said last year that he would not renew China's MFN 
status unless Beijing made "significant overall progress" on 
human rights. 
  Beijing has warned that it would retaliate against a 
withdrawal of MFN, and Chinese Premier Li Peng said earlier this 
week that China would not tolerate interference in its internal 
affairs. 
  Li Lanqing said he had not heard of proposals for limited 
penalities on Chinese exports as an alternative to total 
withdrawal of China's MFN status but commented that the 
privilege was "mutually beneficial" and important for bilateral 
trade. 
  The three-day conference, organised by the New York-based 
Asia Society, has attracted 800 business and political leaders, 
mostly from Asia-Pacific. 
  Washington's decision to link China's MFN status to human 
rights has been criticised by some Asian governments, worried 
that a withdrawal would cause regional economic and political 
harm. 
  Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong Tuesday warned that 
any move to cut off Asia's booming economies from western 
markets could trigger the formation of an Asian trade bloc. 
  "An Asian trade bloc is not an option of choice. But it is a 
viable option," Goh told the same conference Tuesday. 
  Li said China would continue to modernise its economy, tap 
opportunities abroad and provide conditions for foreign 
investors to prosper. 
  "China's development cannot do without the world and the 
world's development needs China's participation," he said.

  [Text] Singapore, May 19 (AFP) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li 
Lanqing indicated Thursday that Beijing had no intention of 
reversing its decision to give a US oil company rights to 
explore for oil in territory disputed with Vietnam. 
  Li said that while Beijing would continue "friendly 
consultations" with Hanoi on overlapping territorial claims in 
the South China Sea, these talks would cover only disputed 
territories, not territory belonging to China. 
  "In regards to indisputable territories, there is no 
question," he told a business opportunities conference here 
organised by the New York-based Asia Society. 
  Li was asked whether China would keep a pledge to its 
Southeast Asian neighbours to keep the peace over territorial 
disputes in the Spratly islands. 
  The islands, which reputedly sit atop vast deposits of oil 
and gas, are claimed in whole or part by Brunei, China, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
  Crestone, a Colorado-based oil company, announced last month 
that it planned to drill into the Tu Chinh sandbar, about 400 
kilometers (250 miles) southeast of Vietnam's coast, under terms 
of a concession signed with China. 
  But Vietnam, which claims that the Tu Chinh sandbar is well 
within its special economic zone and continental shelf, has 
demanded Crestone halt all operations in the area, saying any 
exploration was illegal. 
  Li welcomed remarks by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
at the same conference Wednesday that Hanoi would pursue its 
claims in the South China Sea "through peaceful negotiations and 
in an atmosphere of friendship." 
  He said that Beijing still believed that claimants should 
jointly develop disputed areas. 
  Kiet told the Straits Times daily in an interview published 
Thursday that while Hanoi would defend its territory, it saw no 
reason to use force in Tu Chinh because of improvements in ties 
with China. 
  The Chinese and Vietnamese navies fought a brief but bloody 
engagement in the Spratlys in March 1988. Hundreds of 
Vietnamese were believed to have been killed in the fighting.

  [Text] Singapore, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China is expected to 
import more than one trillion U.S. dollars worth of goods in the 
upcoming years before the end of the century, Chinese Vice 
Premier Li Lanqing predicted here today. 
  He made the projection while addressing the international 
conference of "Waves of the Future - ASEAN, Vietnam, and China: 
Opportunities for World Business". 
  More than 800 delegates, mostly high ranking government 
leaders, successful businessmen, and policy researchers, from 21 
countries and regions around the world are attending the 
three-day conference, which started on Tuesday. 
  "We expect that China's total imports through the years to 
the end of the century will top one trillion U.S. dollars," Li 
said in his keynote speech. 
  "Our determination of and confidence in expanding vigorously 
trade and economic contacts with the rest of the world are 
growing steadily during the course of modernization drive," the 
Chinese vice premier added. 
  In the process of reform and opening-up, he said, China's 
external trade and economic cooperation have indicated a good 
trend of development since 1978. 
  The annual growth rate of China's foreign trade over the 15 
years averaged 16 percent, higher both than the average growth 
rate of China's GDP and that of the world trade in the same 
period. 
  China's foreign trade volume in 1993 stood at 195.8 billion 
dollars with exports totaling 91.8 billion dollars and imports, 
104 billion dollars, he said, noting that China's position in 
world trade moved from the 32nd place in 1978 to the 11th place 
in 1993. 
  Meanwhile, the share of China's exports in the total exports 
of the world was 0.75 percent in 1978 and it accounted for 2.5 
percent in 1993, he said.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter" by XINHUA reporter Xing Heping (6717 0735 </F>
1627): "King Sihanouk in Phnom Penh"] 
  [Text] Phnom Penh, 18 May (XINHUA) -- After attending to 
state affairs in Phnom Penh for 40 days, King Norodom Sihanouk, 
who is deeply loved by the Cambodian people, left here today for 
China to continue his medical treatment there. 
  Sihanouk, who is 72, returned to Cambodia on 8 April. Before 
he returned to Cambodia, he had received six months of medical 
treatment in Beijing. The results were quite satisfactory. 
With the approval of his doctors, he returned to his nation for 
recuperation. When Sihanouk stepped out of the plane, people 
could see that the king was in high spirits, and his face was 
filled with a kindly smile. 
  The doctor by his side suggested that while in Phnom Penh, 
he 
should have lots of rest and eat nutritious food so as to 
restore his health completely, but faced with a complex 
political situation and the task of full-scale reconstruction in 
Cambodia, Sihanouk, ignoring the fact he was recuperating from 
illness, immediately began to work arduously. His schedule was 
very tight. He worked from morning to evening accepting 
credentials, meeting domestic and foreign guests, and attending 
nongovernmental activities, and frequently he worked until late 
at night. 
  Sihanouk is very much concerned about peace and national 
reconciliation in Cambodia, to which he has devoted much of his 
time and energy. Not long after his return, the bloody 
conflicts between government troops and those of Democratic 
Kampuchea in the northwest region were expanding. Worried about 
this, he put forward a proposal on 22 April for convening a 
peace and national reconciliation roundtable conference. The 
leaders of both sides expressed their support the same day, but 
the serious confrontation and distrust created by war and 
political conflicts over a long period of time can in no way be 
dissipated in a short period of time. Both sides could not 
agree on the venue for the meeting, and the roundtable meeting 
slated to open on 2 May was aborted. 
  After that, Sihanouk was disappointed with the way each side 
stuck to its own view. While continuing to mediate between the 
two sides, he mobilized public opinion and popular forces to 
push forward the peace process. On 2 May, Sihanouk met with 
responsible persons and reporters from over 30 newspapers, radio 
stations, and television stations in Cambodia. After that, he 
braved the heat to meet with the chief monk of Cambodia and more 
than 500 monks in front of the palace. During the meeting, he 
repeatedly expounded on the importance of placing national 
interests above all else by immediately stopping fighting and 
restoring peace. He said that according to the Constitution, 
he, as king, is forbidden to engage in political affairs. 
However, peace is not a political issue between political 
parties; it concerns the vital interests of every Cambodian, and 
he has the responsibility to express his views and put forward a 
proposal. 
  On 4 May, while wearing a traditional national costume, King 
Sihanouk stood on the rostrum of the east gate of the palace, 
took part in a peace rally, and made a 40-minute speech. At the 
end of his speech, he told those in attendance that his doctor 
had discovered that the number of white blood cells in his body 
had decreased due to overwork. He said that the state of his 
health was not very good but that he did not mind, and he added 
that he would continue to work to end the war and to restore 
peace in Cambodia. 
  In following his doctor's request, Sihanouk limited his 
daily 
activities to two sessions, and each session was not to exceed 
two hours. In fact, this rule was often broken. On 12 May, 
after a long trip by car, he took part in a Buddhist ceremony at 
a temple for seven hours. Two days later, he traveled by car to 
(Kompiseu) County in Kompong Speu to call on villagers and help 
them solve housing and drinking water problems. 
  Before 1970, Sihanouk used to meet with ordinary people on a 
regular basis. After he returned to Phnom Penh this time, he 
has received at his palace ordinary people every week to listen 
to their opinions. There, he told the officials present his 
views about solving the problems. Sihanouk is very kind to 
children and handicapped people. At the new-life-day activities 
for Cambodian children held on 11 April, Sihanouk braved the 
33-degree heat [Celsius] to distribute clothing to 300 shabbily 
dressed orphans and poor children. He personally measured their 
sizes. When he received handicapped people in the palace, he 
extended his regards to every one of them. It was very touching. 
  Before his departure, Sihanouk comforted his people, saying 
"I will return in two to three months after leaving the country 
for medical treatment. After my illness is cured, I will 
continue to serve the country, the nation, and the common 
people."

Export Corporation which is a state-owned foreign trade 
enterprise under the China National Council of Light Industry.

  [Text] Brussels, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), today held extensive talks with 
leaders of the Belgian Parliament. 
  Li met with Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb, president of the 
Belgian Chamber of Representatives, and Frank Swaelen, president 
of the Belgian Senate, over bilateral relations and 
international issues of common concern. 
  The Chinese official arrived in the Belgian capital on 
Tuesday [17 May] for a five-day visit. 
  During the meeting, Li said that since the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1971, 
bilateral cooperation has developed considerably in political, 
economic and trade fields. 
  The Chinese leader pointed out that there have been more 
exchanges of high-level visits between the two sides while 
bilateral economic and trade relations have been increasing. 
  Since there is great potential and prospects for 
Sino-Belgian 
cooperation, said Li, China hopes both sides will make joint 
efforts for more cooperation. 
  At the request of the hosts, Li gave an outline of China's 
political system reform, its socialist democratic politics and 
the People's Political Consultative Conference. 
  Swaelen said that Belgium is opening up to Asia since the 
center of the world's economy is moving towards the region. 
  He noted that China has an important role in Asia and will 
be 
more and more influential in the world economy and international 
affairs. 
  Li's visit to Belgium shows that China attaches great 
importance in developing relations with Belgium, he added. 
  Belgium is the last leg of Li's five-nation European tour, 
which has already taken him to Finland, Sweden, Norway and 
Denmark.

  [Text] Brussels, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), today urged for mutual 
understanding and cooperation when addressing international 
issues. 
  In a speech at the Royal Institute of International 
Relations 
in Brussels, the visiting Chinese official said, "Differences in 
the social system and ideology between countries should not 
stand in the way of their friendly relations and cooperation." 
  "Mankind should discard the outworn concepts left over from 
history and work together to address problems which are 
increasing and which can not be settled without mutual 
understanding and cooperation," he added. 
  Li arrived here on Tuesday [17 May] for a five-day visit to 
Belgium, which is the last leg of his five-European-nation tour. 
  He indicated that one must pay attention to the objective 
reality in observing international situation. 
  There are over 180 independent sovereign states, he said, 
"these states differ from each other in the social system, level 
of development, historical and cultural tradition, ethnic group 
and religious belief." 
  Each country has its own distinctive features, he declared, 
adding, "it is these distinctive features that contribute to the 
diversity of our world making it a colorful one." 
  "Given the distinctive features, countries that have strong 
and weak points in different areas may learn from each other and 
progress and develop further," Li pointed out. 
  "And those with different social systems and ideologies 
should try to seek common ground while putting aside 
differences, reduce pointless disputes and conflicts and live in 
peace with each other." 
  In fact, he continued, there are also a lot in common among 
different nations. "They have the same goals and something in 
common." 
  He stressed, "It is this generality that lays the foundation 
for international cooperation and exchanges. It is the 
distinctive features of different countries that the generality 
resides. [sentence as received] And it is their enrichment and 
improvement that the generality takes shape and develops." 
  "We must establish norms of conduct for all to observe 
through consultations on an equal footing and on the basis of 
full respect for the distinctive features of each country," he 
urged. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese official also briefed about the 
viewpoints of his country on human rights.

  [Text] Brussels, May 18 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
leader stressed here today that China respects the general human 
rights principle but that must be combined with the specific 
conditions of each country. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, said China respects 
the general human rights principle acknowledged by the 
international community, which is positive to the development 
and progress of mankind, 
  In a keynote speech at the Royal Institute of International 
Relations in Brussels, the Chinese leader said that China, as a 
member of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, supports 
and has taken an active part in the UN efforts to promote and 
protect human rights and basic freedom under the UN Charter. 
  Apart from acceding to eight international human rights 
documents including the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights," 
China has also made important contributions to the deliberation, 
drafting and conclusion of "The Vienna Declaration and Program 
of Action" approved at the world human rights conference last 
year, he added. 
  However, the Chinese official pointed out that "the general 
human rights principle must be combined with specific conditions 
of each country, without which human rights would simply be 
hollow words." 
  As the historical background, cultural tradition and social 
economy vary from country to country, so do the content, forms, 
methods and measures of the human rights policies, he said. 
  It would never work to require different countries to 
indiscriminately apply the same model and take same measures in 
implementing the general human rights principle, he said. 
  "The human rights principle would not be effectively carried 
out until various conditions are taken into consideration," he 
added. 
  For many developing countries, the first and foremost human 
rights to be enjoyed is the right of subsistence and 
development, without which other human rights and freedom just 
could not make sense. 
  The Chinese leader pointed out that people in many 
developing 
countries are still living in poverty with heavy burdens of 
foreign debts, and therefore "the international community, 
especially the developed countries, should fully study these 
problems and seriously push for their solution when they are 
showing concern over the human rights situations there." 
  He also said that the human rights situation of each country 
is inevitably bound to its social development and at the same 
time can be improved gradually along with the progress of the 
society and deeper understanding of the human rights. 
  If the world was divided into two categories, with one just 
supervising the human rights situation in other countries 
without improving that of their own and the other always being 
supervised with no right to speak for themselves, this itself 
would be in contrary to the general human rights principle, he 
noted. 
  In fact, Li said, the human rights situation also has room 
for improvement in some developed countries, where a 
considerable portion of the population are living below the 
poverty line and some minorities are suffering from 
discrimination. 
  He said China guards against interference in other 
countries' 
internal affairs under the human rights pretext and favors the 
principle of mutual respect and understanding, seeking common 
ground while keeping differences and making joint progress in 
the process of carrying out the general principle of the human 
rights. 
  He stressed that China opposes using human rights issue as a 
means to impose political pressure and interfere in another 
country's internal affairs as the practice itself is in 
violation of the human rights of the whole people of the other 
country. 
  Having suffered a lot from imperialist aggression and 
bullying for more than 100 years, the Chinese people are quite 
aware that the human rights of individuals are closely linked 
with their state sovereignty, as the individual's human rights 
would be totally lost if his country can not have independence, 
he said 
  "Therefore, the Chinese people are extremely sensitive to 
and 
will never tolerate any form of interference in China's internal 
affairs," Li underlined. 
  Nevertheless, the Chinese leader noted, the Chinese 
Government is willing to participate in international dialogues 
in the human rights field. 
  "It is normal to have different views on human rights issue 
in the international community, but the differences can be 
bridged through consultation, dialogue and exchange of views 
rather than resorting to pressure and sanction from time to 
time, he said. 
  "Dialogue is always better than confrontation," said Li. 
  As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China will 
continue fulfilling its duty and contributing to promoting 
international cooperation in the human rights field, Li pledged. 
  The Chinese official arrived here Tuesday [17 May] for a 
five- day visit to Belgium, the last leg of his 
five-European-nation tour.

  [Text] Brussels, 18 May (XINHUA) -- At the invitation of 
Belgium's Royal Institute of International Relations, Li 
Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, today delivered at 
the institute a speech entitled "China's Foreign Policy and 
Modernization." He expounded on our country's independent and 
self-governing peaceful foreign policy, fundamental viewpoints 
on the human rights issue, as well as on the issues of reform 
and opening up and modernization. 
  Li Ruihuan pointed out: As in observing any other issues, it 
is necessary to attach importance to and study the objective 
reality so as to base our observation of international issues on 
the objective reality. There are over 180 independent sovereign 
states on our planet which are not totally similar in their 
social systems, historical and cultural traditions, 
nationalities and religious beliefs, and existing stages of 
social development but which possess their individual character. 
It is exactly these types of character that make our world rich 
and varied. As a result, different countries with different 
strengths and inadequacies may learn from one another and draw 
on the others' strengths to supplement their inadequacies; and 
countries with different social systems and ideologies may seek 
common ground while reserving differences as well as coexist 
peacefully. Different countries in the world also share many 
similar things, many common interests, common desires, and 
common tasks. There is commonness among them, and it is exactly 
this commonness that forms the foundation for international 
cooperation and exchanges. And, different countries, on the 
basis of mutual respect, may seek to establish an international 
code of conduct by which everyone will commonly abide through 
consultations on the basis of equality. This is an important 
condition for mankind's progress as well as an important symbol 
of mankind's further maturity in handling mutual relations. 
Mankind should transcend all kinds of outworn concepts left 
over by history and should jointly tackle the increasing number 
of problems on this planet that can only be solved with 
understanding and cooperation. 
  Li Ruihuan said: During this visit, some state leaders and 
friends spoke on the human rights issue from different 
approaches and in different ways. I would like to take this 
opportunity to give a briefing on China's concept of human 
rights. 
  First, we respect the universal principle of the 
international community on human rights. The correct principle 
on human rights generally recognized by the international 
community has a positive meaning for human development and 
progress. As a member nation of the UN Human Rights Commission, 
China supports UN efforts in promoting and protecting human 
rights as well as man's fundamental freedom, undertaken in 
accordance with the purpose and principles of the UN Charter. 
In addition, China has actively participated in various UN 
activities on human rights. China participated in drafting and 
formulating UN human rights documents and also has acceded to 
eight international documents on human rights, including the 
"Universal Declaration on Human Rights", the "Tehran 
Declaration," and the "Declaration on the Right to Development." 
China made important contributions through active participation 
in discussing, drafting, and formulating the "Vienna Declaration 
and action plan" passed at the World Conference on Human Rights 
last year. 
  Second, we stress that the universal principle on human 
rights must be combined with the specific situations of 
individual countries. Like any other thing, once the human 
rights issue is allowed to deviate from the unification of the 
ordinary and exceptionalness as well as of a common and specific 
character, it is impossible to attain practical results, and the 
issue will result in empty talks. Due to different historical 
backgrounds, cultural traditions, and levels of socioeconomic 
development, each country will be different in the content and 
form as well as methods and measures while implementing the 
universal principle on human rights. It will not succeed to ask 
different countries to indiscriminately use the same 
preconceived model, continually use the same method, and adopt 
equal measures. The universal principle on human rights can be 
implemented practically only when consideration is given to 
various different situations. As for many developing countries, 
the human rights that should first be realized are the right to 
subsistence and the right to development. If the majority of 
people in these countries do not possess the minimum conditions 
for survival, then what more can we say about other human rights 
and freedoms? Currently, the people of many developing 
countries are living a poor and difficult life, and they are 
shouldering heavy burdens of foreign debt. The international 
community, particularly developed countries, should be concerned 
about the human rights situation in these countries and give 
full and earnest consideration to finding solutions to these 
problems. 
  Third, we believe that the manifestation of human rights is 
a historic process. All countries are, without exception, 
passing through this historic process. Yet, the human rights 
conditions in various countries have been inevitably constrained 
by their levels of social progress. Meanwhile, as their 
societies progress and they deepen their understanding of human 
rights, various countries have been continually improving their 
human rights conditions. They cannot stay aloof from the issue 
as they all have the obligation to further improve their 
peoples' human rights standards. If we divide various countries 
in the world into two groups -- one group specializing in 
supervising other countries' human rights conditions without the 
need to improve those conditions in their own countries, while 
another group is under other countries' supervision without the 
right to speak up -- this action itself is a rejection of the 
universal principle on human rights. In fact, in some developed 
countries, quite a number of people live below the poverty line, 
and some minority nationalities are being discriminated against. 
They also have the problems to further improve their human 
rights conditions. 
  Fourth, China guards against [jing ti 6226 1912] some 
countries that interfere with other countries' internal affairs 
on the pretext of human rights. We affirm that while pursuing 
the universal principle on human rights, various countries 
should respect one another, foster mutual understanding, seek 
common ground while preserving differences, and make progress 
together. However, we are opposed to human rights issues being 
used as a means to exert political pressure and to interfere 
with another country's internal affairs. This action itself is 
an encroachment on the human rights of all the people in that 
country. The Chinese people have been invaded and dreadfully 
bullied by imperialists for more than a century, and fully 
understand that personal human rights and freedom are closely 
linked with the state's sovereignty. Once the country loses its 
independence, all personal human rights will be lost completely. 
Therefore, the Chinese people are very sensitive to, and cannot 
stand, any form of interference in China's internal affairs. 
  Fifth, the Chinese Government is willing to participate in 
international dialogues on human rights issues. It is normal 
for the international community to have different opinions on 
human rights issues. If there are differences, we can hold 
consultative dialogue and exchange views, but should not 
frequently resort to applying pressure and sanctions. Holding 
dialogue is better than waging confrontation. Many facts show 
that dialogue can enhance understanding and comprehension, 
eliminate misunderstandings, and attain mutual understanding. 
China will, as always, fulfill its own obligations as a 
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and make 
its due contributions to enhancing cooperation in the 
international community on human rights issues. 
  In his speech, Li Ruihuan also commented on China's reform, 
opening up, and modernization drive, and on the relations 
between China and West Europe and between China and Belgium. He 
said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping has profoundly pointed out: "Two 
conditions will decide whether China's modernization drive will 
succeed. The first condition is the domestic situation. We 
have to uphold the current policies on reform and opening up, 
and to maintain a peaceful and united political situation. The 
second condition is the international situation which is 
characterized by a lasting peaceful environment." The 
independent and peaceful foreign policy pursued by China is 
required for us to enhance economic and social progress. Only 
if the international environment is peaceful and stable for a 
long time, can we make concerted efforts to facilitate economic 
construction, carry out friendly cooperation with various 
countries in the world, and learn from all the advanced 
achievements of civilization in other countries. 
  Diplomats, economists, and businessmen in Belgium who 
attended the meeting welcomed Li Ruihuan's speech. After his 
speech, Li Ruihuan also answered attendees' questions. 
  Former Belgian Prime Minister Tindemans chaired today's 
meeting.

  [Text] Copenhagen, 17 May (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, was accorded a warm and 
friendly reception when he visited the Royal Danish University 
for Veterinary Science and Agriculture and the Nuovo Corporation 
this morning. 
  The Royal Danish University for Veterinary Science and 
Agriculture is Denmark's only institute of higher learning for 
agriculture as well as one of Europe's oldest agricultural 
colleges. 
  In the company of University President Dr. (Ben ser 
Nielsen), 
Li Ruihuan visited the university's veterinary studies 
department and heard a general briefing on the university. Dr. 
Nielsen expressed his hope for strengthened educational and 
scientific and technological exchanges between Danish and 
Chinese universities. 
  Later, Li Ruihuan visited the world-famous Nuovo 
Corporation. 
Last year the corporation recorded a business turnover of 12.2 
billion kroner and captured a world market share of 50 percent 
for its insulin and over 40 percent for its enzyme products, 
respectively. 
  In the afternoon Li Ruihuan visited Denmark's largest 
foodstuff producer -- the (Danisco) Corporation.

  [Text] Skoplje, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Macedonian Economic 
Minister Petrus Stefanov has expressed the hope that his country 
will see an early end to the war in ex-yugoslavia so that the 
former Yugoslav Republic could be saved more economic losses. 
  The minister told XINHUA recently that Macedonia has 
suffered 
heavy economic loss from the war and the related sanctions 
against Serbia. 
  Macedonia had been the poorest republic among the six 
republics of the former Yugoslavia. About 80 percent of its 
national economy was related to other republics and 45 percent 
of its external trade depended on Serbia, Stefanov said. 
  After the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, and especially 
since the Bosnian conflict, Macedonia's overseas market has 
shrunk sharply. 
  The main railroads and highways to the outside were almost 
paralyzed after the UN sanction resolution against Serbia, which 
was compounded by Greece's imposition in February of an embargo 
on Macedonia. 
  Macedonia's monthly average economic loss now stands at 150 
million U.S. dollars this year, and total losses reached 1.8 
billion dollars in 1993, Stefanov added.

Defense Chi Haotian met with Zbigniew Zalewski, deputy chief of 
General Staff and chief of logistics of the Polish Army today, 
expressing the hope for enhancing contacts between the two 
armies. 
  The armies of the two countries had had the same experience 
in fighting against fascists and aggression in the past and 
under the new situation, they also share common issues of 
economic development and army building in their respective 
countries, he said. 
  Some experience of Poland's army building is also worth 
learning, said Chi, who visited Poland in 1992 as chief of the 
General Staff of the Army. 
  Zalewski said he was deeply impressed by the marked progress 
scored by the Chinese Army in its army building. He also shared 
the view of Minister Chi that there exists a great potential for 
further cooperation between the two armies. 
  Zalewski and his party also traveled to Shanghai and Nanjing 
during their visit to China.

"CHING HSIANG Editor Chen Dongdong's Whereabouts Is Unknown, His 
Three Colleagues Are Also Subject to Harassment"] 
  [Text] New York, 18 May (LIEN HO PAO)--Bei Ling, a founder 
of the CHING HSIANG magazine who now lives in Boston, the United 
States, disclosed that Chen Dongdong, the magazine's poem editor 
on the mainland, was summoned to the Shanghai Public Security 
Bureau for interrogation last week, and his whereabouts were 
unknown up to 18 May. Meanwhile, three other editors of the 
magazine on the mainland had been harassed by the authorities to 
a varying extent; and the residence of Bei Ling's parents in 
Beijing was searched by public security personnel. Bei Ling has 
already written to the U.S. PEN and the International PEN to 
raise the case and draw their concern to the issue of personal 
freedom of mainland Chinese writers. 
  Bei Ling said: Except for Meng Lang, a well-known vanguard 
poet, who has gone south to avoid trouble early this year, all 
the other four CHING HSIANG editors in Shanghai, namely, Chen 
Dongdong, Chen Zishan, Zhu Dake, and Sun Ganlu, have been 
frequently summoned by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for 
"interrogation" since early April. They were mainly questioned 
about the participation of any "reactionary elements" abroad in 
the editorial work of CHING HSIANG, any financial contributions 
by such people to the magazine, and Bei Ling's activities during 
his tour of the mainland from late last year to early this year. 
The police also asked Bei Ling's younger brother, who is 
working in Shanghai, to give an detailed account of Bei Ling's 
social contacts in Shanghai.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pursue Civil Affairs Satisfactorily, Promote </F>
Social Stability and Development"] 
  [Text] The 10th National Civil Affairs Conference, which 
was convened by the State Council, ended today. Party and 
government leaders and civil affairs workers gathered together 
to discuss plans for reforming and developing civil affairs 
work. These discussions will play an active role in reforming, 
developing, and promoting social stability. We warmly 
congratulate the convocation of the conference. 
  Civil affairs is a key work area for the party and 
government. Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
Central Committee, civil affairs departments at all levels, 
guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and led 
by the party and government, have revolved closely around 
economic construction and have self- consciously linked civil 
affairs work closely with the country's economic development and 
social stability, taken the job of ensuring the well-being of 
the daily lives of people -- the target of civil affairs work -- 
as a mission basic to the maintenance of social stability, 
upheld reforms, worked in a down-to-earth manner, and played a 
key role in creating a stable, unified, democratic, and 
harmonious social environment beneficial to socialist 
modernization. Reform has injected vitality into civil affairs 
work. Reform in disaster relief management and the unfolding of 
social old-age insurance in rural areas has promoted the 
development of social security in rural areas. Flourishing 
community services have brought a new outlook for urban social 
welfare services, and the activity of competing for the creation 
of "two-support" model towns (counties) has opened a new 
dimension in welfare work to provide preferential treatment, 
pensions, and home placements. Civil affairs work has scored 
various long-term achievements and is vibrant and flourishing. 
  The Central Committee has stressed that seizing 
opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding opening up, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability is the overall 
framework for party and government work. Civil affairs work is 
a key integral part of government work. We must resolutely obey 
and serve this overall framework, fully exercise the functions 
of civil affairs departments, and satisfactorily pursue rescue 
and relief work, social welfare, the work of providing 
preferential treatment, pensions, and home placement, the 
construction of grass-roots political power and mass self-rule 
organizations, rural social old-age insurance, and social 
welfare and social management work, such as that concerning 
community bodies, marriages, child adoption, and funerals. The 
main responsibility of civil affairs work is to safeguard and 
protect, with state-given powers and according to the law, the 
people's basic living rights and interests. It represents a 
basic demand of socialism and shows the superiority of the 
socialist system. 
  Civil affairs work concerns thousands of households and is 
connected with people's lives, intimately related to various 
socialist modernization projects, and strongly social in 
character. It involves mass participation. Civil affairs work 
departments must understand and study new situations emerging 
under the socialist market economy system, sum up new 
experiences, and solve new problems. Party committees and 
governments at all levels must strengthen leadership and put it 
high on their agenda. Concerned departments must care about and 
support civil affairs work and mobilize forces in various social 
sectors in a joint effort at civil affairs work. Its missions 
are arduous and responsibility great. We are convinced that 
guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 14th CPC 
Congress, and led by the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, civil affairs work will score greater achievements and 
make new contributions toward maintaining social stability and 
promoting socialist material and spiritual civilizations.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] The State Planning Commission [SPC] has warned that 
millions of state enterprise workers close to retirement pose 
the biggest threat to social stability in China. 
  In the commission's First Quarter Analysis and Second 
Quarter 
Outlook -- which has been handed over to the State Council -- 
analysts say frozen salaries at a time of high inflation and the 
inadequacy of pensions will make newly retired workers "the most 
unstable factor" in the country over the next one to two years. 
  "They face big problems. They will be retiring on low fixed 
incomes with little in the way of pensions to support them," an 
SPC official said. 
  The state sector employed 109 million people at the end of 
1993, of which 20 to 30 percent are due to be retired because of 
age or redundancy. 
  This means the target group includes between 22 and 33 
million people. 
  An additional 20 percent of the workforce -- or 22 million 
-- 
are already retired and living on low fixed incomes. The report 
compares state enterprise workers -- who account for almost 
three quarters of employment in urban areas -- to the middle 
class in developed capitalist countries. 
  "Overall social stability depends on their situation," the 
official said. 
  Average retirement pay for state sector workers now stands 
at 
about 130 renminbi (HK$115) per month, the SPC official said, 
which put households that rely on such incomes in the category 
of "encountering living difficulties". 
  The report blames the heavy tax burdens and lack of 
competition in the state sector as the main cause of their 
present sorry state. 
  In the first two months of this year, 40.7 percent of state 
enterprises lost money. 
  The SPC report makes two suggestions: credit policies should 
not be tightened any further and no big economic reforms should 
be introduced over the next one to two years which might put 
state enterprises in an even worse competitive position.

<F P=106> [By Bian Hongwei: "State Clamps Down on Fake Products"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign trademarks registered in China are 
receiving protection from the country's administrative 
management and judicial trial [as published], just like Chinese 
trademarks. 
  Administrative departments for industry and commerce and 
courts at all levels are authorized to investigate, handle and 
hear cases of trademark counterfeiting and infringement. 
  Foreigners who think their trademark rights are being 
infringed upon can lodge their complaints with either the court 
or administrative authorities. 
  "The system has proven efficient in resolving trademark 
disputes," Zhao Gang, an official with the trademark office 
under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), 
told CHINA DAILY. 
  Presently, SAIC has designated six offices to handle 
complaints from foreign enterprises. These include the Patent 
and Trademark Agency under the China Council for the Promotion 
of International Trade, China Trademark Agency, Shanghai Patent 
Agency, China Patent Agent (Hong Kong) Ltd, NOD Patent and 
Trademark Agent Ltd and China Sinda Intellectual Property Agent 
Corporation. 
<H5>  Professionals </H5>
  With professionals familiar with the country's laws and 
proficient at foreign languages, these offices are believed to 
save the time and energy of foreign trademark registrants. 
  The SAIC is now designating more "representative offices" 
throughout the country, with priority given to the relatively 
developed coastal regions, said Zhao. 
  Statistics show that administrative authorities for industry 
and commerce handle some 13,000 trademark cases annually, among 
which about 500 involve foreign trademarks. 
  The SAIC and its local branches also undertake regular 
market 
supervision to stop trademark infringement in its early stage, 
said Zhao. 
  This large amount of work is being done by some 6,000 
full-time employees at the SAIC head office and local divisions. 
  On the judicial front, the country's courts are playing an 
important role in protecting intellectual property rights 
including foreign trademarks. In large cities such as Beijing, 
Shanghai and Guangzhou, relevant departments have been set up at 
either the higher or intermediate courts for that purpose. And 
more can be expected in many coastal cities. 
  Co-operation between the administrative authorities for 
industry and commerce and procuratorial departments are 
fruitful, Zhao said. Statistics from the SAIC show that in the 
last two years, the authorities have handed over more than 3,000 
suspects to judicial offices, where the criminals have been 
sentenced. 
  Zhao said infringement of intellectual property rights is 
almost omnipresent. In the West, many infringement cases deal 
with patents and copyright. Infringement of computer software 
copyright has been a decade-long headache in the United States. 
  "China is willing to co-operate with foreign countries in 
protecting intellectual property," said the SAIC official. 
  By the end of last year, the country had registered a total 
of 411,000 trademarks; nearly one-seventh of them belonged to 
foreign companies, a 10-fold increase over 1979. 
  This indicates that foreign traders are confident about the 
country's economy and the protection of intellectual property 
rights in China, Liu Minxue, Director of SAIC, told a press 
conference last month. 
<H5>  Convention </H5>
  Liu said his administration provides special protection to 
well-known trademarks in line with the Paris Convention for 
Protecting Industrial Property Rights. 
  China joined the Convention in 1984. It also joined the 
Madrid International Registration in 1987, the Berne Convention 
and Universal Copyright Convention in 1992. 
  At the press conference, Liu exposed 14 major cases 
involving 
the infringement of foreign trademarks registered in China. 
Most cases have to do with enterprises from the United States, 
including the Eastman Kodak Company, Levi Strauss Company and 
the Coca-Cola Company. 
  China put into effect its first Trademark Law a decade ago. 
And the State revised the law and its implementing regulations 
last year to be in line with the market economy. 
  According to the revised law, fines on trademark infringers 
have been raised from less than 20 percent to 50 percent of the 
total amount of the illegal trade volume or from twice to five 
times the illegal profits. The longest imprisonment term for 
trademark counterfeiters has been raised from three years to 
seven years. 
  Several criminals involved in trademark infringement have 
been sentenced to death during the past few years in the country. 
  The Patent Law, the Copyright Law and the Anti-Unethical 
Competition Law have also been promulgated during the past 
decade. 
<H5>  Difficulties </H5>
  However, the SAIC admits to existing difficulties in 
implementing the laws. 
  In some areas, the laws are not strictly carried out, SAIC 
officials say. 
  They call for a unified organization to manage the 
protection 
of trademarks and improve work efficiency at local branches. 
  As China is trying to resume its status in the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this year, its performance 
in protecting intellectual property is now one of the key 
focuses for GATT decision-makers.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- China's 
Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Public Security, and All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions recently issued a joint document 
prohibiting foreign-funded and privately run enterprises from 
shutting up their workplaces and dormitories to restrict the 
personal freedom of employees, and said that those who commit 
such crimes will be pursued with criminal responsibilities by 
the judicial departments according to the law. 
  When issuing the "Notice on Strengthening Labor Management 
in 
Foreign-Funded and Privately Run Enterprises, and on Earnestly 
Protecting the Legitimate Rights of Workers," the 
above-mentioned three organs clearly stipulated that 
foreign-funded and privately run enterprises cannot hire peasant 
workers without authorization, cannot put women workers in 
dangerous posts, and cannot hire child labors. 
  The "Notice" points out that the level of wages in 
foreign-funded and privately run enterprises cannot be lower 
than the level stipulated by the state and local governments, 
that the enterprises should give pay increases to workers in a 
timely manner according to the inflation index in the country 
and to the production and operation conditions of the 
enterprises, and that the enterprises must give full wages to 
workers on time and in the form of hard currency and must not 
owe them wages or deduct their wages. 
  The "Notice" says foreign-funded and privately run 
enterprises should strictly implement the state's system of a 
average 44-hour work week for workers, as well as the holiday 
system. 
  According to information, workers in foreign-funded and 
privately run enterprises, based on the spirit of the "Notice," 
may report to the local labor department, public security 
department, trade union, and relevant department those 
enterprise activities that violate the labor law.

regulations are minerals that are specified by the State Council 
-- based on the requirements of facilitating national economic 
construction and developing high-technology, and on their 
scarcity and value, and that are extracted with the approval of 
relevant State Council departments in accordance with state 
plans. 
  State-designated mining zones are mineral 
resource-distribution zones demarcated by the state -- based on 
given construction plans and mineral resources programs -- in an 
effort to develop large and medium mines. 
  Mining zones that are of key importance to the national 
economy are mineral resource-preserve zones that are specified 
by the state in an effort to develop the national economy, that 
are not yet incorporated into national construction programs, 
and that have abundant and quality deposits and good prospects 
for development.

environment. 
  Article 23. Any disputes between holders of prospecting 
rights over prospecting boundaries shall be settled by the 
parties involved through consultation; in the absence of a 
settlement through consultation, a ruling shall be given by the 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources of the 
provincial, autonomous regional, or municipal government having 
jurisdiction over the area of prospecting operations. In the 
absence of a settlement through consultation between the 
prospecting parties involved, a dispute over a prospecting area 
extending across provincial, autonomous regional, or municipal 
borders shall be settled through consultations between the 
provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal governments 
concerned; and shall be subject to a ruling by the State Council 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources if the 
provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal governments

  [Text] Shanghai (CEIS) -- Shanghai, China's leading 
industrial and financial center, has become a new production 
base of nuclear power equipment, according to industry sources. 
The city's power equipment manufacturing industry has provided 
equipment for the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations, 
the country's only two nuclear power stations. Recently, the 
industry signed technical agreements to assist the second-phase 
construction of Qinshan and part of the contract for exporting a 
300,000-kw nuclear power plant to Pakistan. So far, the city 
has invested nearly 200 million yuan in its nuclear power 
equipment manufacturing industry, for construction of capital 
projects covering 93,000 square meters. Since 1988, Shanghai 
has also earmarked more than 13 million yuan from its treasury 
to support crucial nuclear power research projects. Sixty-two 
of the research projects have passed appraisals. Meanwhile, 
the central government has commissioned Shanghai to tackle 11 
key research projects related to the construction of a 
600,000-kw nuclear power station, and has allocated more than 12 
million yuan to upgrade Shanghai's nuclear power equipment 
production capacity. During the 1996-2000 period, Shanghai 
will be able to build one to 1.5 sets of nuclear power equipment 
a year.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "China Trains More Young Scientists"] </F>
  [Text] Hefei, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China is training and 
promoting more young scientists for its modernization plans into 
the next century. 
  Among them are 30-year-old Dr. Chen Yongcong, who was 
promoted to professor of physics at the Chinese University of 
Sciences and Technology; 34-year-old Chen Zhangliang a 
department head at Beijing University; and 34-year-old Wang Wei, 
professor of communications at Nanjing's Dongnan University. 
  Professor Hu Liming, 31, of Shanghai's Huadong (East China) 
University of Science and Engineering, is known as a "rising 
star" in science and tutors students for doctor's degrees. 
  "Training trans-century talented people is one of China's 
programs aimed at helping the country catch up with the rapid 
international developments in science," an official of the State 
Education Commission said. 
  The central government will mobilize both central and local 
efforts to do a good job of running 100 major universities and 
colleges to approach the advanced international level in the 
quality of education, scientific research and management in the 
coming years, the official said. 
  According to him, priority will be given to the development 
of Qinghua, Beijing, Shanghai Fudan, Shanghai Jiaotong and Xian 
Jiaotong Universities this year. 
  Vice Premier Li Lanqing has called on localities to train 
leaders in trans-century sciences by saying, "the Chinese 
Government will offer its support in manpower, goods and 
materials to create a better environment for young talented 
people to display their abilities." 
  China has set up a special foundation to offer funds for 
young people to carry out research and participate in academic 
activities at home and abroad. 
  Guo Qipeng, a 30-year-old professor at the Chinese 
University 
of Sciences and Technology, has set up a high polymer laboratory 
for young scientists at home and abroad to use. 
  "My purpose is to create opportunities and conditions for 
them to bring their initiative into full play so that they can 
become influential academic leaders in the field of high polymer 
science," the professor said. 
  Professor Lu Jupu who was awarded the title of "outstanding 
young scientist" by the central government, attributed his 
success to the improved academic environment these days. 
  Professor Li Xiaoguang, 33, of the Chinese University of 
Sciences and Technology has put forth new ideas for the study of 
superconduction, for which he has been highly commended by 
experts at both home and abroad. 
  Xu Xiaoming, China's youngest tutor guiding doctorate 
students in automation control at Shanghai Jiaotong University, 
has put forward a new theory for the forecasting and control of 
industrial systems and elicitation method control for robots. 
  He has been invited by a U.S. mathematics society to write 
articles specially for it. 
  Known as an expert in handling photo information, Li Chang 
of 
the Chinese Civil Aviation Institute has developed three 
research findings in the past two years.

<F P=106> [By Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- Briefing the press and 
relevant departments on China's economic situation, State 
Planning Commission spokesman Wei Liqun said today that this 
year, under the guidance of the party Central Committee's 
general policy of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development, 
and maintaining stability," the nation has made new headway in 
reform, opening up, and economic construction. He said: On the 
whole, the state of economic development is improving, and the 
fast growth in industrial production, investment, consumption, 
and commodity prices has slowed down somewhat. This is a good 
trend. However, great attention must be paid to certain 
economic problems. Efforts to control inflation, in particular, 
should not be slackened. 
  Wei Liqun said: The many major reform measures announced 
this year are being carried out normally. The plans that the 
State Council put forward early this year for reforming 
financial operations, taxation, monetary affairs, and the 
systems governing investment, foreign exchange, and foreign 
trade are being implemented. Central and local taxes have been 
separated in most prefectures and counties. Tax reform is 
proceeding steadily. Under the new tax system, receipts and 
payments maintained their normal growth during the January-April 
period, and the budget was being executed according to plan. 
The reform of the monetary system was proceeding on the basis 
of the principle of separating policy-based [zheng ce xing 2398 
4595 1840] monetary affairs from commercial monetary affairs. 
The National Development Bank has been officially established, 
and preparations for setting up other policy-based banks have 
been intensified. Foreign exchange reforms during the first 
quarter included the consolidation of foreign exchange rates, 
recalling foreign exchange coupons, and establishing counter 
accounts [tai zhang 0669 1600] for export businesses. The 
exchange rate between the dollar and the renminbi has been 
maintained at approximately 1:8.7. The nation's foreign 
exchange revenue has grown quite substantially. Banks have been 
converting and selling foreign exchange since 1 April. Ever 
since it began to operate on 4 April, foreign exchange dealings 
between domestic banks and foreign banks have been active at the 
Chinese Foreign Exchange Trade Center, whose main traders are 
banks authorized to provide foreign exchange service; and the 
amounts of foreign exchange converted have been greater than the 
amounts of foreign exchange sold. Pilot reform projects of 
establishing modern businesses have also started. 
  On the whole, the economy is developing according to 
requirements set for the exercise of macroeconomic regulation 
and control. Since early this year, the economy has continued 
to maintain its fast growth, with some decline. The first 
quarter's GDP was 12.7 percent higher than the same period last 
year. That included the 5.5-percent increase for primary 
industry, the 15.8-percent increase for secondary industry, and 
the 7.9-percent increase for tertiary industry. 
  -- Agricultural production is warming up. Following the two 
conferences sponsored by the central government to discuss rural 
affairs and the national conference on "food basket" projects, 
all local authorities have grown grain and cotton on all 
designated acreage, have increased investment in projects that 
support agricultural production, and have hastened to build 
vegetable and nonstaple food bases in large and medium cities. 
Farmers' enthusiasm for production has been aroused. 
  -- Industrial production has been maintaining its relatively 
fast growth. The value added of the nation's industrial 
production during the January-April period topped that of the 
same period last year by 16.4 percent, and the sales rates of 
goods were maintained at 92.2 percent. The excessively low 
growth of state-owned industrial enterprises has also started to 
change. In April, the total industrial output value of 
state-owned industrial enterprises increased 5 percent, or 
nearly three percentage points higher than the figure for the 
first quarter. 
  -- The monetary situation has been stable. By 28 March, 
the amount of currency issued from New Year's Day to the period 
around the Spring Festival had all been withdrawn from 
circulation, and the withdrawal was still continuing at the end 
of April. Compared with the same period last year, savings 
deposits by urban and rural residents during the January-April 
period increased by more than 130 billion yuan. Since the 
treasury bonds were floated to the public on 1 April, over half 
had been purchased by 10 May. 
  -- The sharp rise of investment in fixed assets has been 
somewhat restrained. The increase in investment in fixed assets 
has continued to decline. During the January-April period, the 
amount of money which state-owned units invested in fixed assets 
was 38.4 percent higher than that of the same period last year, 
but the size of increase [zeng fu 1073 1607] was 30.5 percentage 
points lower than that of the same period last year. On the 
whole, the investment structure was better than that of the same 
period last year. Compared to last year, the capital needed for 
priority projects was more readily available. 
  -- The domestic market is basically stable. Total retail 
sales of consumer goods during the January-April period were 25 
percent higher than for the same period last year. After being 
adjusted for price factors, the actual growth was 4.2 percent. 
Currently, the supply and demand of at least 90 percent of 
commodities are basically balanced, or with the supply being 
greater than the demand. Owing to the strict control of the 
size of investment, sales of capital goods have been stable. 
  -- Foreign trade has been growing steadily. During the 
January-April period, total exports reached $28.04 billion, or 
22 percent higher than for the same period last year. The 
growth in April -- the month in which the growth of exports 
exceeded imports for the first time since September 1992 -- was 
29.6 percent higher than for April 1993. Total imports during 
the January-April period increased 20.3 percent, reaching $29.79 
billion. 
  -- The dramatic rise of commodity prices was brought under 
preliminary control. The rise of commodity prices slowed down 
noticeably in March. The monthly link relative index [yue huan 
bi zhi shu 2588 3883 3024 2172 2422] dropped from over 3 percent 
in January and February to 0.9 percent. As result of tightening 
the monitoring of the prices of basic necessities and services, 
promoting the practice of marking prices openly, and carrying 
out a nationwide price check, prices have become less disorderly 
than before. 
  Wei Liqun said: According to preliminary estimates, compared 
to the same period last year, the GDP of the first six months 
will be about 12 percent higher, the total industrial output 
value will grow by about 18 percent, state-owned units' 
investment in fixed assets will grow by about 30 percent, and 
total retail sales of consumer goods will increase by about 22 
percent, and the price rises will continue to slow down during 
the second quarter. 
  He added: The current economic situation shows that while 
certain problems appearing during the fast economic growth in 
the past two years have become less serious in one way or 
another, the foundation for balancing economic aggregates is not 
very strong, and the leeway for macroeconomic regulation and 
control is limited, and thus considerable time is still needed 
before structural problems and ineffective operating mechanisms 
created over a long period of time in the past can be resolved. 
Thus, over the next few months, the intensity in exercising 
macroeconomic regulation and control must be maintained and all 
plans must be carried out cautiously, meticulously, and firmly.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186): "The Third </F>
`Foreign' Tide--Roundup of Current Developments in Use of 
Foreign Funds in China"] 
  [Text]Upsurge in "Foreign" Tide 
  In late 1993, a government spokesman announced loudly to 
Chinese and foreign reporters that China that year had become 
the second largest foreign funds recipient in the world. The 
amount of funds drawn in that year was equal to the total amount 
for the 14 previous years. In the same year, more than 83,000 
foreign-funded projects were approved, involving $111.4 billion, 
of which $27.5 billion was actually used to run the projects. 
The increases in these three figures over the previous year 
were 70.6, 91.7, and 150 percent respectively. Meanwhile, in 
Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as the supply of office floor 
space to consumers related to foreign business firms fell short 
of the demand, many potential renters were looking for leases. 
Some high-ranking officials said jokingly that this was the 
third "foreign" tide since 1979, characterized by the influx of 
foreign funds! 
  The years 1984 and 1988 saw two peaks of foreign investment 
in China. Now, after ups and downs, this upsurge in the great 
tide has finally gained enough momentum to bring forward the 
third peak. So far, the actual amount of foreign funds drawn in 
has reached $61.8 billion and the number of foreign-invested 
enterprises exceeds 100,000, employing a labor force of nearly 
10 million and accounting for nearly 8 percent of the country's 
gross industrial output value and about one-third of the 
country's import-export volume. Beijing Jeep, Xian Jansen [2799 
2773], Shenzhen Kangjia [1660 0163], Tianjin Shike [0670 0344], 
and Shanghai Volkswagen... all these brand names and the 
products bearing these brands have long been regarded by the 
Chinese public with great relish. 
  At present, a new, multilevel, omnidirectional opening-up 
pattern is taking shape in China, integrating coastal areas, 
areas along rivers and borders, and hinterland provinces and 
regions. Amid this process, investments by foreign businessmen 
are showing the following new characteristics: 
  --The sources of investments are diversified and investments 
are imported from more than 120 countries and areas, of which 
Hong Kong (including Macao), Taiwan, the United States, and 
Japanese interests are the largest investors. 
  --Investment targets are extended from coastal areas to the 
hinterland because the proportion of foreign investments in the 
hinterland in the total foreign investments in the country has 
increased by more than 10 percent. 
  --Investment forms tend to be diversified. Since 1992, 
nearly 30 Sino-foreign joint ventures and a few stockholding 
companies aiming at investment in productive projects have 
received approval for their establishment and more than 50 
enterprises have issued category B and category H stocks abroad. 
By issuing stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, Maanshan 
Iron and Steel Corporation managed to raise capital of nearly 4 
billion Hong Kong dollars on a single occasion. Efforts are 
being made to explore other investment instruments, such as 
funds, bonds, and trusts. 
  The formation of this new pattern has been followed by a 
great shift in the focus of investment: 
  --The investment structure has been further optimized in the 
wake of the shift from short-cycle, appropriate technology and 
quick- return medium and small projects to capital- and 
technology-intensive medium- and long-term large projects. The 
average investment value per project, which used to be less than 
$900,000 before 1991, increased to nearly $1.35 million last 
year, with a number of investment projects of rather great size 
beginning in infrastructure and basic industries. Of the 
FORTUNE 500 largest enterprises, 52 companies have entered China 
to make investments in 26 trades, involving nearly $4 billion. 
This accounts for about 50 percent of all U.S. investments in 
China. Technological cooperative projects run by IBM, Dupont, 
Bell, Siemens, Philips, Mitsubishi, and Matsushita have been 
launched in China in turn and all these investors are very 
eagerly expanding their investment scale. 
  --The field of investment is expanding daily. In the past, 
over 90 percent of foreign-funded investments were in productive 
type projects. According to last year's incomplete statistics, 
however, at least 20 percent of the projects and 30 percent of 
the investment funds have now gone to real estate, development 
of large tracts of land, tourist facilities, and other branches 
of tertiary industry, such as transport, banking, insurance, 
consultative services, and commercial retail sales. After the 
Japanese Yaohan International Marketing Group's arrival in 
Pudong, some open cities have now begun to allow foreign 
businessmen to invest in large commercial building projects and 
some information and consultative service companies and 
accountant firms, run using Chinese and foreign capital, have 
also been allowed to start business. Foreign businessmen are 
even encouraged to run newly opened sea transport routes and 
invest in oil fields in North China, including the Tarim Basin 
oil field. 
  --In addition to this, we have also seen a shift of focus 
from separate, single investment projects to joint investment or 
combined regional development projects. 
  The introduction of foreign funds has, to a certain extent, 
made up for the shortages in funds to run construction projects 
in China. At the same time, the import of foreign advanced 
technology, equipment, and management know-how has filled gaps 
in some industries and foreign-funded enterprises have become 
the mainstays in such industries as auto manufacturing, 
elevator, color TV tubes, and microelectronics. 
  The introduction of foreign capital into China has given an 
impetus to the transformation of the operational mechanism in 
Chinese enterprises. Foreign-funded enterprises have set a good 
example to local ones and many old Chinese enterprises have been 
reinvigorated through joint projects with foreign firms. 
China's number one leading clock and watch manufacturer, the 
Polaris Group, which faced an impasse before introducing foreign 
capital, is once again thriving and the Harbin "Suibao Thermal 
Flask" has also made its might felt once again after introducing 
overseas capital. 
  The introduction of foreign capital has also helped expand 
export trade producing foreign exchange earnings and increasing 
financial revenue. According to customs statistics, the 
import-export volume of foreign-funded enterprises alone totaled 
$43.75 billion in 1992, equal to the country's total 
import-export volume 10 years ago. Last year, China's tax 
revenue contributed by taxpayers related to foreign capital 
totaled 20.5 billion yuan, an increase of 80 percent over the 
previous year. 
  So we may say that the third "foreign" tide signifies the 
most exciting and influential development in China's 
accelerating marketization and internationalization process. 
<H5>  Only the Fittest Will Survive </H5>
  However, one cannot be sure that no negative factors arise 
as 
the "foreign" tide surges ahead. There is no doubt that we have 
faced some problems when introducing foreign funds. The 
following are some of the prominent problems: 
  The distribution of foreign funds is still irrational. 
Medium and small projects in general processing industries 
still make up rather too big a proportion of all the 
investments, whereas relatively few key investment projects have 
been launched to develop economic sectors which badly need to be 
developed. What is more, investments are dispersed and 
investment projects which have been initiated blindly are quite 
common. For example, in 1992, a great influx of foreign funds 
went into the real estate industry. This was because some 
localities which were very eager to draw in foreign funds laid 
undue stress on "quantity" rather than on "quality," and they 
did not know enough about the distribution of foreign funds, the 
technology involved in foreign-funded projects, their scale, and 
the market conditions. 
  Control over importing foreign funds has yet to be 
intensified. Some foreign businessmen do not keep their promise 
to provide the funds to finance investment projects, or the 
funds are recalled soon after they were laid out, whereas the 
enterprises concerned continue to enjoy the preferential 
treatment which has already been granted. Some foreign-funded 
enterprises claim to be suffering losses but many of them are 
actually making profits, claiming to be suffering losses only to 
avoid tax payment. Such practices lead to a remarkable drain on 
state-owned assets. Some foreign-funded enterprises do not 
export their products according to the ratio as prescribed in 
the contracts signed, trying instead to enlarge their share of 
the domestic market and thus reducing the state's foreign 
exchange earnings. In 1992 alone, the gap between import and 
export value by foreign-funded enterprises was as wide as $1 
billion and management-labor disputes and industrial accidents 
happen from time to time. In the final analysis, these can be 
attributed to some other main causes beside the unsound system 
of laws and regulations. Certain localities have arbitrarily 
formulated their preferential policies, contract examination and 
approval procedures are not strict enough, and in some cases the 
procedures are so loose that whatever is submitted will be 
approved without exception. In addition, the undue stress laid 
on preferential treatment in terms of policy has landed some 
state-owned enterprises, as well as township and town 
enterprises, in an unfavorable position in the market. 
  The investment environment in some localities does not seem 
to be good enough as transport, energy, and telecommunications 
facilities are still underdeveloped; regulations and laws 
governing the use of foreign funds are not sound enough; and the 
market mechanism has not been established. This hinders the 
normal operation of foreign- funded enterprises and the inflow 
of foreign capital and, as a result, some big consortia with 
intentions of investing in China are still hesitating to really 
make a move. 
  Many foreign businessmen said they are very eagerly looking 
forward to a healthy and orderly environment investment which 
encourages fair competition, since a few "preferential" measures 
alone can never substitute for a long-term policy. State 
Statistical Bureau recently conducted a sample survey of more 
than 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises and these selected 
enterprises called strongly for action as soon as possible to 
step up the establishment of a system of laws concerning foreign 
investors and increase the transparency in the process of 
importing foreign funds. 
<H5>  Let the "Foreign" Tide Surge Still Higher </H5>
  Some time ago some people were doubtful as to whether or not 
"the amount of foreign capital imported into this country is too 
much or not enough." In this regard, an authoritative source of 
the foreign capital administration department of the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted that China must be 
one of the few developing countries that have imported the 
largest amount of foreign capital in absolute value. But, while 
other countries started importing foreign capital in the 1960's, 
China did not make a move until the early 1980's, not to mention 
the fact that we lost the golden opportunity around 1989 for 
various reasons. In terms of the per capita amount of imported 
foreign capital, China ranks far behind Southeast Asian 
countries and the actual amount of investment made by foreign 
businessmen accounts for only about 10 percent of the total 
value of the country's fixed assets. Therefore, objectively 
speaking, the amount of foreign capital imported into the 
country is not too much but, instead, is not enough. 
  The survey concerned reveals that China enjoys the 
following major advantages in attracting foreign investors: An 
ample supply of labor force, a fast growing economy, and an 
incomparably vast market. A newly founded small development 
zone, with an area of only 0.5 aquare km, in Wuhu City, Anhui 
Province, which perviously was little known to foreign 
investors, has attracted investors from 10 countries and areas, 
not to mention the special economic zones along the coast and 
the large municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. A 
city in Zhejiang Province nicknamed "the pocket-sized entry 
port" attracted a host of foreign businessmen as soon as it 
declared its intention to invite foreign investment. The Hong 
Kong Wharf (Holdings) Group owned by the late world-class 
shipping magnate Y.K. Pao, and other big companies, such as 
General Motors, Chengta [2973 1129], and Mitsui, have invested 
$10 to $100 million U.S. dollars in that city. This has fully 
proved foreign investors' great interest in China as well as our 
country's appeal to foreign investors. 
  The problem is how are we going to ensure better quality of 
foreign investment projects while trying to attract more foreign 
capital. 
  The shift of focus from quantity to quality is a gradual 
process. Our people used to be afraid that importing foreign 
capital would result in the occupation of our market by foreign 
interests, that foreign-funded enterprises would squeeze out 
state-owned enterprises or, in brief, that foreign investors 
would take away all the benefits. Views like these have been on 
some people's minds all the time during the opening-up process. 
A city in Jiangsu Province prepared a list of enterprises, with 
extremely low economic returns, which were about to close down, 
and they were recommended as partners for joint ventures with 
foreign investors. Meanwhile, those enterprises with good 
economic returns and great potential for development were 
"protected" by being excluded from the joint venture candidate 
list. As a result, over a long period, foreign- funded 
enterprises in that city have had no chance to thrive. Some 
joint ventures which were running big projects and had already 
had large factory buildings built could not start operation 
simply because the government department concerned hesitated to 
give them the green light. 
  In fact, it is fair for us to pay some price to attract 
foreign businessmen to make investments in our country. The 
purpose of investment is to make money, and only if you are 
willing to give away some "benefits" will you be able to dispel 
others' doubts and misgivings, will investors be willing to 
invest in large-scale and high-tech projects, and will we thus 
enjoy domestic prosperity. Now that Coca-Cola and McDonald's 
have come, the beverage and fast food industries are thriving on 
an unprecedented scale. Motorola's huge investments have 
enabled hundreds of thousands of Chinese to use the wonderful 
telephone pagers. If the Shanghai Volkswagen had not been 
transformed into a Sino-German joint venture, this plant, we are 
afraid, would not have been able to produce Santana-brand cars 
so soon. What is our greatest advantage? It is the enormous 
market with a 1.1-billion population. So "market in exchange 
for capital" and "market in exchange for technology" are the 
only natural choices before us when we are to capitalize on 
foreign funds.

  [Text] In an apparent bid to support the yuan's eventual 
free convertibility, China is to keep out potential foreign 
investors who cannot balance their own supply and demand of 
foreign currencies. 
  Under provisional regulations scheduled for release in the 
third quarter of the year, Beijing will demand that 
foreign-funded companies show proof that they can meet their 
foreign currency expenses before setting up ventures on the 
mainland. 
  If they cannot do so, their applications will be turned down 
unless they receive approval from the State Administration of 
Exchange Control (SAEC) to gain access to swap centres, where 
foreign companies trade hard currency when it is available. 
  SAEC approval will be given only to foreign companies 
engaged 
in sectors actively promoted by the country. 
  At present, when a foreign investor puts in an application 
to 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation to set up 
a factory or office in China, he submits a feasibility study, 
which includes a report on the inflow and outflow of foreign 
currencies. 
  Although the law also requires him to balance his hard 
currency, it is not rigorously enforced. 
  While some foreign investors cannot balance the foreign 
currency demand and supply, they are still allowed to set up in 
China and may subsequently turn to the swap centres for hard 
currency to meet any shortfall. 
  "The new regulations mean that China, as a fundamental 
point, 
does not want to keep bailing out foreign-funded enterprises. 
It wants them to be self-sufficient in foreign currency," said 
William Chan, a Price Waterhouse partner. 
  He said China had a trade deficit and would not want foreign 
enterprises to further drain the country's foreign exchange 
reserves, estimated at about U.S.$50 billion. 
  Last year, the trade deficit was about $12 billion. 
  "What they are going to tell the foreign investors is this: 
we're going to look closely at your feasibility study to make 
sure you can meet your own foreign currency needs," said Mr Chan. 
  China last year contracted investments of about $110 
billion, 
equivalent to the amount for the past 14 years. 
  "Given the record levels of investments in the last two 
years, China is more confident about the inflow and feels it can 
afford to be stricter," said Tsang Shu-ki, senior lecturer at 
Hong Kong Baptist College's department of economics. 
  He added that China's economic supremo, Zhu Rongji, had said 
that the country would need to build up at least $100 billion in 
foreign reserves before it made the yuan fully convertible. 
  The new regulation, by requiring foreign enterprises to meet 
their own demand and supply of hard currencies, will ensure that 
there is no drain on foreign reserves.

<F P=106> ["LIAOWANG Forum" by staff commentator: "Strict Control </F>
Over the Scale of Investment Is Key to Success in Reform and 
Development"] 
  [Text] At present, China's economy is in a crucial period 
in which a new system is replacing the old. The task of taking 
various reform measures to maintain sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170 4958 
1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the economy is very heavy. 
How can the tasks of reform and development be smoothly 
fulfilled? Strict control over the scale of investment in fixed 
assets is the key. 
  In the past year, the whole party and all the people of the 
country have seriously implemented arrangements made by the 
central authorities concerning macroregulation and control, 
acted in unison, made concerted efforts, and achieved positive 
results in resolving conspicuous contradictions and problems 
which have emerged in economic development. Since the beginning 
of this year, the macroeconomic environment has remained 
pessimistic. The credit and currency situation has not eased. 
Transportation capacity, energy supply, and the supply of raw 
materials have shown a tendency to become tighter. New 
enterprise debts continue to increase. In particular, the rise 
in commodity prices is excessive and inflationary pressures 
continue to increase. All this shows that if strict control 
over the scale of investment in capital construction is not 
continuously exercised and if such investment is allowed to 
grow, the entire national economy will eventually become 
uncoordinated and the fluctuations which will occur will cause 
tremendous losses. Moreover, if such a situation occurs, we may 
lose the historic opportunity we have at present. Therefore, 
the central authorities have paid special attention to 
controlling the scale of investment and have decided, beginning 
from this year, to establish a restriction and risk mechanism 
for investment in fixed assets, to conduct a general inspection 
of the scale of investment, and to adopt various measures to 
curb growth in investment and to maintain a basic overall 
balance in the economy. This is entirely correct and necessary. 
  To date, leaders of some localities and departments still do 
not have a sober understanding of the situation and are still 
blindly expanding the scale of capital construction. This is 
mainly expressed by: in making arrangements for capital 
construction projects, some localities have divorced from 
unified planning and have tried to set up a "small but complete" 
systems or to duplicate things; some, ignoring actual 
possibilities in local financial and material resources, have 
hankered after competition with others in doing things on an 
excessive scale, resulting in a waste of resources; some have 
violated construction procedures, encouraged "making investments 
first and using the status quo as pressure to gain approval" and 
"acting first and reporting afterward"; and others have broken 
up major projects into parts to avoid applying for state 
approval and have expanded the scale of construction scale and 
standards without authorization after projects have been 
approved; and so on. What are the consequences of such 
practices? If such projects go beyond the capacity of national 
strength to bear and readjustments have to be made, the damage 
done will be serious and the opportunity for economic 
development will also be forfeited. We have had many lessons in 
this respect in the past and we should keep them in mind. 
  Why is it so difficult to control the scale of investment 
despite the fact that the situation is clear, the reason is 
clear, and our experiences of an expansion of investment on 
several occasions have been bitter? What is the root cause? To 
solve this problem, we should have a correct understanding of 
how to handle the relationship between macroregulation and 
control on the one hand and rapid development on the other, in 
addition to overcoming structural drawbacks through deepening 
reform. 
  At present, some people think that since we practice a 
market 
economy and seek rapid development, we should no longer have 
macroregulation and control over investment activities. Such a 
way of thinking is not correct. In a modern market economy, 
especially when our country is still in the "catching up stage" 
of economic development as at present, the extent of market 
development is limited, and the gap between the level of 
economic development of different localities and of the urban 
and rural areas is relatively great, the market itself, because 
of its own weaknesses, cannot settle the issues of an overall 
balance in the macroeconomy, the rational distribution of 
resources, and fair distribution in society. Correct and 
effective macroregulation and control carried out by the 
government can correct market imbalances and remedy defects of 
the market, and only by organically integrating the two will it 
be possible to give normal play to the foundation role of the 
market in the allocation of resources and to promote the 
sustained and healthy development of the national economy. 
  Another idea holds that in recent years, some localities 
have carried out flexible "adaptations" and have "made use of 
gray areas" in implementing the central authorities' policy of 
macroregulation and control and have rapidly developed the 
economy, while those who have honestly and obediently acted 
according to the policies of the central authorities have 
"suffered losses." Therefore, violations of regulations are 
regarded as "successful examples" in speeding up local economic 
development for various localities to follow. This is something 
totally undesirable. In the course of replacing the old 
structure with the new, indeed there are still many loopholes in 
the structure for some people to take advantage of because our 
policies and laws are not yet sound. However, such practices of 
achieving local development at the expense of overall interests 
have jeopardized the healthy operation of the entire economy. At 
present, investment continues to grow at a high level and the 
macro situation is tending to become tense. Has this nothing to 
do with the fact that some localities have ignored warnings? 
Just imagine, if all localities staked economic development on 
studying "countermeasures," what would the situation of economic 
development in our country be? That the central authorities 
have called for strict control over the scale of investment in 
fixed assets and for the comprehensive use of various means to 
regulate investment activities is precisely to correct and 
restrict unstandardized and even illegal economic activities and 
to create a fair environment of competition for honest people 
who really act according to the policies of the central 
authorities. 
  Correctly handling the relationship between reform, 
development, and stability involves the overall situation in 
various kinds of work this year. Strengthening macroregulation 
and control over investment in fixed assets and strictly 
controlling the scale of capital construction are an extremely 
important aspect of subordinating to, and serving, the overall 
work situation. Each locality and each department should, in 
accordance with overall state planning and a rational layout, 
proceed from local reality, seek truth from facts, and do what 
they are capable of, and they should never follow the beaten 
track of ignoring objective conditions, stubbornly seeking 
output value and speed, and blindly expanding the scale of 
investment. It is necessary to comprehensively and correctly 
understand and implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and to really shift 
the focus of work to readjusting the structure and increasing 
economic results. This is the economic objective we should seek 
in reform and development and is also where our hope for the 
modernization of our country's economy is placed.

"`Stability' in Commodity Prices"] 
  [Text] The General Level Must Be Stable 
  Commodity prices have to fluctuate as well as stabilize. Is 
this contradictory? 
  Given that we recognize price fluctuations, why should we 
still emphasize stability? 
  This is because the price fluctuations that we recognize 
refer to moderate rather than drastic and disruptive ones; and 
stability refers to keeping the general level of price rises 
basically stable rather than freezing prices from any changes. 
We have to seize the opportunity to get through fluctuations in 
price reform so as to accelerate the pace of economic 
development, but we must also create a macroscopic environment 
of price stability so that our economy can continue to develop 
in a healthy manner. 
  Fluctuations and stability are just like two sides of the 
same coin which cannot be separated. In price reform, relaxing 
restrictions is not equivalent to noninterference, while 
fluctuations are not tantamount to loss of control. 
  The general price level is a comprehensive concept. This 
year's 10 percent is precisely the general level of price rises 
which the state wants to control and realize. Whether or not 
the economic situation is stable will, to a very large extent, 
depend on whether or not we can prevent price rises from going 
far beyond the 10 percent limit. 
  According to economic experts' analyses, the growth rates of 
GDP and of price rises would be better kept in the ratio of 
1:0.6. This year's 9 percent economic growth and 10 percent 
price rises are in the ratio of 1:1.1. Compared with the base 
of last year, this ratio can be described as a high speed of 
economic growth and a low inflation rate. However, since this 
year's low price rise level is pulled down from last year's high 
level, we still cannot underestimate the difficulties in 
controlling this year's general price level. 
  Obviously, there are many factors affecting the general 
price 
level. To keep commodity prices under control, we have to 
proceed from many aspects. 
<H5>  Acting Against Seeking Exorbitant Profits--An Urgent Task </H5>
  It is not the case that all kinds of price fluctuations are 
reasonable. 
  In the market, we do not rule out the existence of some 
unique commodities. Maybe a thing is precious when it is 
scarce, and it is natural that the prices of those unique 
commodities are higher than those of ordinary ones, but they are 
only a minority. Quite a number of commodities are priced far 
beyond their own worth without taking the situation of market 
demand and supply into account. To keep the general price level 
under control, we must take strong measures against prices 
seeking exorbitant profit. 
  Last year, a wristwatch was priced at 990,800 yuan in a 
certain shop, but this year, the price rose to 1.2249 million 
yuan. A dumpling was sold at four yuan in a certain restaurant, 
but, to everyone's surprise, the restaurant asked 80,000 to 
100,000 yuan if one wanted to book a table. All these are not 
cases of fixing prices at one's discretion, but cases of asking 
exorbitant prices and of running fraudulent businesses by 
forcing up prices. 
  Certain production and management enterprises, plagued by 
the 
"price starvation disease," cannot restrain themselves, but 
rather take advantage of the relaxation of price controls to 
drive up prices at will and to shift the burden onto consumers; 
while certain traders, plagued by the "blind pricing disease," 
do not fix reasonable prices in light of market demand, 
mistakenly believing that they can reap huge profits by marking 
prices at will. People can choose not to buy those commodities 
for which excessive prices are charged, but they cannot prevent 
those who are seeking exorbitant profits from driving up prices. 
  Recently, how to act against the seeking of exorbitant 
profits and fraudulent practices has become a common concern. 
In drawing up regulations against practices seeking exorbitant 
profits, Shanghai first defined the concept of seeking 
exorbitant profits. Any charges exceeding prescribed average 
prices and reasonable profit margins are considered as moves 
seeking exorbitant profit which must be punished. This is a 
weapon given to consumers. But still, some people say that it 
is not enough to merely give a quantitative definition, and we 
should also evaluate traders' motives and purpose in raising 
prices. If fraudulent means are used to raise a certain price, 
even though it is not large in quantitative terms, it should be 
treated as a fraudulent move and one which seeks exorbitant 
profits, and must be punished. 
<H5>  Directed Against the Crux </H5>
  Where does the crux of price rises lie? 
  If the impact on prices of a small number of traders' 
illegal 
profit-seeking moves is a point to be reckoned with, the factor 
bringing about overall price rises within greater limits is the 
issuance of too much currency and the expansion of fixed-asset 
investment. This is the root cause of a constant, overall, and 
high level of commodity price rises, that is, inflation. The 
crux lies precisely in keeping price rises under control. 
  Investment is necessary for the development of our 
economy. Be it a province, a city, or a prefecture, there are 
thousands of reasons and grounds for investment. However, when 
all these are added together, they precisely become the force 
driving up our country's general price level. 
  After analyzing the relationship between the growth of 
fixed-asset investment and changes in commodity prices over the 
past 14 years, some people have discovered the following 
characteristics: 
  1. When the growth of investment is equal to or lower than 
the average growth rate, it will not trigger off large-scale 
commodity price fluctuations; 
  2. Generally speaking, price rises will emerge a year after 
an investment boom. When the scale of fixed-asset investment 
expands drastically and exceeds the average growth rate of 
investment in a certain year, then huge commodity price rises 
will emerge in the following year. 
  In order to achieve a rapid and healthy development of our 
national economy, we do not rule out the possibility of making 
more investment in a certain year but less in others. However, 
overall, we must control the scale of fixed-asset investment 
within proper proportions. We must provide a material basis for 
development, but also keep severe inflation in check and 
maintain a relatively stable general level of commodity prices. 
  Macroscopic regulation in 1993 promptly eased the 
inflationary pressure, but by the end of last year there were 
still unfinished projects worth 130 million yuan created by 
greater investment, registering an increase of 60 percent over 
that of the previous year; and 30 to 40 percent of investment 
was put into the market in the form of consumption funds, thus 
creating more demand, which drove up prices. The aftereffects 
of excessive growth in money supply will be felt more noticeably 
this year. 
  There are indications that in the first two months of this 
year, the growth rate of state-owned units' fixed-asset 
investment dropped as compared with last year; and another good 
sign is that more and more investment is being made in projects 
at the central level, in coastal areas in the eastern part of 
the country, and in the communications and transportation 
sector. However, macroscopic regulation is still needed to 
oversee the strong trend of investment growth. 
<H5>  Beware of the "Float Phenomenon" </H5>
  From a long-term point of view, subsidies have to be 
abolished. But for a fairly long period, subsidies cannot be 
abolished. 
  In order to offset part of the pressure caused by price 
rises 
and to maintain the situation of stable development, the state, 
at a time of price rises, often provides large amounts of 
subsidies to lighten consumers' burden. In order to stop price 
rises for some commodities, the state also gives large amounts 
of capital subsidies to production enterprises, wholesalers, and 
retailers. This is what people call "hidden subsidies." 
  However, we must have a good grasp of the degree of 
subsidies. Commodity price researchers analyzing this situation 
say that subsidies are another manifestation of rises in the 
commodity price index. That is to say, subsidies are an 
essential measure for keeping commodity prices stable. However, 
while price rises are held in check, the potential energy of 
price rises is also stored up by subsidies, and will be released 
when we run into financial difficulties and normal economic 
operation is affected. If the open index of price rises is 
considered as one level, subsidies are another level of price 
rises beneath the horizontal line. 
  This is what they call the "float phenomenon." Just like a 
float on the sea, the open price index is the part of the 
"float" on the surface; whereas subsidies are the underwater 
part of the "float," which is called "hidden price rises." The 
sum of the two parts should be the concrete growth rate of 
after-subsidy prices. 
  Can we reduce subsidies so as to seek moderate price rises? 
According to the analysis of the departments in charge of 
commodity prices, it is possible to do so, and will be 
determined by the macroscopic environment of a basic balance of 
demand and supply. When the macroscopic environment is 
relatively relaxed, we can duly accelerate the pace of price 
reform because there will not be excessive price rises and the 
growth rate of subsidies can be lowered correspondingly. 
  That is to say, when we are in a condition to duly relax 
restrictions on commodity prices, even if we reduce some 
subsidies, there will not be a huge increase in commodity prices. 
  It is thus clear that under certain conditions, the hidden 
price rises created by too many subsidies may exceed the rate of 
price rises brought about by relaxing restrictions on commodity 
prices. Hence, for some commodities with strong competitive 
power in the market, it is better to provide fewer or even no 
subsidies, and the way out is, after all, to gradually achieve 
basic stability of prices in light of market fluctuations. 
  Of course, this is not to say that all subsidies can be 
abolished at a stroke. The application of subsidies should be 
determined by how relaxed or strained the macroscopic economic 
environment is. 
<H5>  New Problems </H5>
  As far as the requirements of moving toward marketization 
are 
concerned, the price reform has not succeeded and it must be 
deepened. Keeping the general level basically stable is the 
prerequisite for deepening the reform. 
  The formerly distorted price structure has been, to a 
certain 
extent, rectified, but so far has still to be thoroughly 
changed. Ever since the policy of reform and opening up was 
implemented, the prices of extraction industries and basic raw 
and processed materials industries have been rising by more or 
less the same margin, hence the prices of basic industries, 
which were originally on the low side, are still low at present. 
Relying on the market to distribute resources is precisely 
empty talk if prices are not straightened out. 
  For example, some petroleum prices have been raised since 
the policy of reform and opening up was implemented, but it is 
getting more and more difficult to exploit petroleum and so the 
costs keep increasing. Since the price and the cost of crude 
oil are not in harmony with each other, it is difficult to 
increase output, which very much restricts our national economy. 
This is also one of the reasons accounting for the marked 
growth in imported petroleum in recent years. The coal 
industry, likewise, faces similar problems. 
  Meanwhile, unjustifiable phenomena are also present in the 
prices of commodities and in the service sector. 
  That is to say, reforming the unreasonable price structure 
cannot be achieved by a few adjustments. 
  Moreover, inflation over the past few years has also offset 
the revised higher prices of some commodities. For example, 
grain prices have been raised and restrictions on purchase 
prices have been relaxed several times, and the purchase and 
selling prices of grain are basically the same, but peasants 
have to bear higher costs of grain production because of the 
huge increases in the prices of agricultural means of 
production, hence the advantages of price rises disappear. To 
deepen the price reform, there are still many things to do. 
<H5>  Can Prices Be Checked? </H5>
  Faced with the complicated situation, can we hold the 
general 
price level in check? As shown by the determination of the 
party Central Committee and the State Council and various 
price-regulating measures recently introduced, it is possible to 
do so. 
  The foundation is, first of all, not to regulate commodity 
prices for prices sake but to aim at creating a good macroscopic 
economic environment and to hold inflation in check by 
maintaining an appropriate economic pace so as to bring the 
general price level under control; and to bring excessive demand 
under control and to hold drastic price fluctuations in check by 
guaranteeing normal production. 
  The "shopping basket" and the "rice bag" projects are 
commodity prices most directly felt by people, and their 
stability is the foundation of stable prices. Not long ago, the 
State Council delegated the authority to take charge of the 
"shopping basket" project to mayors of large and medium-sized 
cities, who are held accountable for accomplishing the project. 
Moreover, every year the mayors have to report their assessment 
results to the people's congresses and people of their cities. 
This is an absolute order issued to the mayors. 
  As indicated by information, it is no good not to issue such 
an order. The impact on the "shopping basket" project of the 
construction and development of some cities has already affected 
daily supply and led to drastic commodity price rises. 
Vegetable markets in some localities have changed into pet 
markets and vegetable farmland into development zones; while 
financial subsidies given to key nonstaple foods in some 
localities have also been abolished. 
  After experiencing excessive price rises in grain, cooking 
oil, meat, and vegetables by the end of last year, many cities 
were soberly aware that the "shopping basket" project is a 
"365-day project," which must be handled firmly every day. The 
most fundamental way as well as the strongest means to bring 
commodity prices under control is to guarantee production and 
supply, particularly proceeding from controlling commodity 
prices of key agricultural and sideline products. The 
municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have adopted 
various means not only to have a rich "shopping basket" but also 
to build up firm "vegetable farmland." 
  How can price reform measures be introduced in such a way as 
not to cause drastic fluctuations? Comrades from departments in 
charge of commodity price regulation hold that as far as price 
reform is concerned, we must take into account the three aspects 
of our ability to bear, that is, the state, enterprises, and 
consumers, and no single one of them can be dispensed with. In 
introducing every reform measure, the principles which we must 
grasp are not to add to the state's financial burden; that the 
increased cost of raw and processed materials thus caused can be 
controlled within the limits to which normal production and 
management of enterprises can adapt; and that the living 
standard of most people will not drop because of price rises. 
  Comrades studying the commodity price reform liken the 
existence of these three conditions to a "satellite launch 
window." We should choose such a "window" to introduce reform 
measures. If the necessary conditions are not present, we would 
rather put off reform and, at the same time, actively create an 
environment for such reform. This is a safe and prudent move. 
  It is also precisely the most significant foundation and 
source of confidence for the state's macroscopic regulation. In 
the balance measuring the triangular relationship among the 
state, enterprises, and consumers, the weight of the consumers 
is the heaviest. Macroscopic regulation can control inflation 
within bearable limits, that is, the growth of urban residents' 
cost of living and income and peasants' earnings are higher than 
the extent of commodity price rises. Once inflation goes beyond 
bearable limits, the state can also intensify macroscopic 
regulation to impose strict controls on it. 
  We should admit that owing to differing income levels, some 
people are weaker in bearing commodity price rises; for example, 
workers and staff who retired a long time ago and incumbent 
personnel of enterprises without good benefits. The state has 
already urged the various localities to take special care of 
them. Now, the compensation system linking basic old-age 
pensions with the cost-of-living index has been implemented in 
some localities; while funds for aiding the poor have been set 
up in some cities to subsidize low-income groups and households 
with special material difficulties. Moreover, some localities 
have laid down minimum income levels for incumbent workers and 
staff and a minimum livelihood protection level for unemployed 
workers and staff. All kinds of assistance are given to them to 
solve their problems. 
  How Should Departments Responsible for Commodity 
Price Administration Control the Situation? 
  A consumer went to the Administration of Commodity Prices to 
sue a store where she had bought several meters of woolen cloth, 
because she found that the same cloth was being sold $10 to $20 
cheaper in another piece-goods store. Therefore, she urged the 
administration to punish the first store. 
  Similar situations can be seen everywhere. Should the 
Administration of Commodity Prices punish the store? According 
to the defined jurisdiction of price reform, an overwhelming 
majority of traders selling ordinary consumer goods are 
authorized to fix prices directly, and the Administration of 
Commodity Prices should not frequently take punitive action 
against stores. Hence, the first way in which consumers must 
protect themselves is to learn how to select among various 
prices for the same commodity. 
  So, at a time when restrictions on the prices of most 
commodities have been relaxed, how does the Administration of 
Commodity Prices regulate commodity prices in the market? How 
to safeguard consumers' rights and interests? All these are new 
problems posed for departments responsible for commodity price 
regulation. 
  Obviously, we cannot, as was done in the past, take an 
account book and examine and approve, item by item, every 
commodity price, neither can we refuse to have anything more to 
do with the matter and let prices rise. We must blaze a new 
trail of indirect administration. 
  The goal and task of our price reform in the next stage is 
precisely to establish a system of macroscopic regulation with 
indirect administration as the core, in which prices can be free 
of restrictions but can also be brought under control. This is 
also a historic transformation of the functions of commodity 
price administration. 
  We have relaxed restrictions on the prices of grain, edible 
oil, meat, eggs, and vegetables since the policy of reform and 
opening up was started, but following the panic purchase 
occurring at the end of last year, the state swiftly took such 
measures as setting up reserves and setting price limits to 
bring commodity prices under control as quickly as possible. 
This indicates the possibility of accomplishing indirect 
commodity price administration and controlling market commodity 
prices by means of macroscopic regulation. 
  Gao Tiesheng and Liu Wen, officials from the State Planning 
Commission's Department of Market and Commodity Price 
Regulation, say that a system of macroscopic regulation of 
prices should include five points: Setting up a system of price 
regulation at both the central and provincial levels; 
administering prices through comprehensive application of 
economic, legal, and administrative means; setting up price 
regulation funds and a reserve system for important commodities 
at the two levels; establishing a system to monitor commodity 
prices and to take precautions against drastic fluctuations; and 
installing a sound system of laws and regulations. 
  At present, price regulation funds and reserves of important 
commodities are becoming the two firm systems in various 
localities which help to control sudden price rises in the 
market due to seasonal changes and the arrival of holidays or to 
cope with disastrous events. The systems at the central level 
are being vigorously established. 
  Monitoring commodity prices and taking precautions against 
drastic fluctuations are the key tasks of departments 
responsible for commodity price administration which have had 
their functions transformed. Beijing Municipality has 
introduced or is drawing up eight laws and regulations. As far 
as the work of price forecasting is concerned, it includes 
analyzing the situations of production, supply, marketing, and 
consumption, the trend of changes in prices, mass expectations, 
and changes in demand and supply in neighboring areas. A system 
of placing price rises on file is implemented for most 
commodities, whereas for a small number of commodities a system 
of reporting price rises to the higher authorities and of 
controlling the rate of price differentials is implemented, and 
price ceilings are set to guard in advance against drastic price 
fluctuations. 
  The state administration of a small number of directly 
priced 
necessities and service charges is very strict. Not long ago, 
the state unequivocally announced that 20 commodities and 
services which were already priced by the market would be 
subject to rigorous inspection. As long as prices are fixed 
within the prescribed limits, arbitrary price rises can be 
checked. 
  Price reform is also a systematic project of the overall 
economic operation, which can never stride forward while 
divorced from reforms of the planning, taxation, monetary, and 
foreign exchange systems and from the development of enterprise 
restructuring. Price reform must proceed in cooperation with 
other reforms. As long as we seize opportunities to promote 
price reform while taking into account all sides' ability to 
bear price fluctuations, prices will not run wild but will be 
controllable.

  [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- Interim Provisions for 
the Financial Control of Foreign Exchange To Be Used for 
Nontrade and Nonoperational Purposes: 
  Article 1. These provisions are formulated to strengthen the 
financial control over the budgetary buying of foreign exchange 
for nontrade and nonoperational purposes. 
  Article 2. Foreign exchange needed by various offices, 
undertakings, and mass organizations for nontrade and 
nonoperational purposes within their budget will be bought with 
renminbi on a limited basis. 
  Article 3. The limit for buying foreign exchange with 
renminbi will be authorized in a unified manner by the financial 
departments. The Bank of China (including its branches -- 
similarly hereinafter) will open accounts for units using 
foreign exchange according to the amount of foreign exchange 
authorized by the financial departments and will supervise their 
use. At the end of the year, the account balance will be 
automatically erased by the bank. 
  Article 4. The kinds of budgetary use of foreign exchange 
for nontrade and nonoperational purposes include the following: 
  (1) Foreign exchange for regular and advanced studies abroad 
with public funds. 
  (2) Foreign exchange for paying annual fees, share fees, and 
funds to international organizations. 
  (3) Foreign exchange for foreign aid, international 
assistance, and donations. 
  (4) Foreign exchange for initial and regular expenditures of 
government organizations, embassies and consulates, and offices 
set up by social organizations abroad. 
  (5) Foreign exchange for hiring foreign experts. 
  (6) Foreign exchange for short-term official visits and 
inspections abroad; holding exhibitions and study and training 
classes; and attending international conferences.

  (9) Foreign exchange for other approved budgetary uses. 
  Article 5. Procedures for the purchase of foreign exchange: 
  (1) Various purchasing units should present an "application 
form for a nontrade foreign exchange purchase" and a renminbi 
check to the Bank of China to purchase foreign exchange 
according to the exchange rate on that same day within the 
authorized limits. 
  (2) The Bank of China will sell foreign exchange to 
purchasers within the approved limit after checking their 
"application form for a nontrade foreign exchange purchase," 
their seals for their accounts, and their exact figures of 
foreign exchange. 
  (3) Units in need of foreign exchange cannot purchase 
foreign exchange in excess of their authorized limit, and the 
Bank of China must not sell foreign exchange in excess of the 
authorized limit. 
  Article 6. Various central units should forward reports on 
their yearly plan for using renminbi to purchase foreign 
exchange for those purposes to the Finance Ministry. Various 
local units should forward reports on their yearly plan for 
using renminbi to purchase foreign exchange to local financial 
departments (bureaus), which will submit those reports to the 
Finance Ministry. After balancing the overall requirement for 
foreign exchange, the Finance Ministry will decide the quotas of 
foreign exchange for various central units and tell the Bank of 
China to establish limits in the accounts of those central units 
on a quarterly basis. The quotas of foreign exchange to be

departments of various locales on a quarterly basis through the 
Bank of China. 
  Article 7. The financial and accounting departments should 
examine the "application form for purchasing foreign exchange by 
departing delegations or groups (personnel)" submitted by 
delegations or groups for impromptu official visits to foreign 
countries in a strict manner according to the standard for 
expenditures set by the Finance and Foreign Ministries. Those 
delegations or groups should submit their accounting within 10 
days of their return to China and should forward "notes for

forward a "(combined) statistical report on the state of using 
renminbi to purchase foreign exchange for nontrade purposes" and 
a "(combined) statistical report on the status of the authorized 
limit for purchasing foreign exchange with renminbi" to 
financial departments at the same level within five days of the 
end of each quarter. 
  Article 9. All documents and forms should be printed by the 
Finance Ministry. Financial and accounting departments should

<F P=106> [By Bao Yueyang (0545 2588 7122): "Macroeconomic Regulation </F>
and Control Arrives At Crucial Stage"] 
  [Text] According to the State Statistical Bureau, in the 
first quarter of this year our country's GDP increased by 12.7 
percent over the same period of last year. The growth rate 
still seemed to be too high but, because of the low proportion 
of agriculture and the high proportion of industry in the first 
quarter, the figure could be turned into an annual growth rate 
of 9 to 10 percent. That is to say, the economic operation 
moved into the target scope of macrocontrol. The comprehensive 
assessment of the economic operation by the State Statistical 
Bureau was changed from somewhere between the "red light" and 
the "yellow light" to the current condition between the "yellow 
light" and "green light." As far as the internal economic 
structure was concerned, the growth rates of production, 
construction, and sales, which were too fast, declined somewhat 
and the economy as a whole maintained an appropriate growth rate. 
  From the somewhat overheated condition of the economy in the 
first half of last year to the basically normal condition in the 
first quarter of this year, an arduous and great change was 
effected. An authoritative economist stated at a recent 
symposium with deep feelings that, if the central authorities 
did not make a timely decision on macroeconomic regulation and 
control, it is certain that major problems will occur in our 
economy and we might not be able to sit here quietly to discuss 
things. A few months ago, people in some localities and 
departments still held various different opinions on 
macrocontrol but people now see things clearly and have agreed 
that macrocontrol is necessary. 
  In general, however, we still cannot say that a decisive 
success has been scored in macrocontrol; what we can say is that 
results in the initial stage of macrocontrol have been achieved. 
This is because, at present, our economy is still facing 
prominent difficulties and problems and the task of carrying out 
further macrocontrol remains rather arduous. 
  According the main economic indicators in the first quarter, 
the current macrocontrol is at a key stage: The economic growth 
rate has basically fallen to the target scope of macrocontrol 
and the value of the economic boom is also at an appropriate 
level, so no major fluctuations should be caused; on the other 
hand, the price increase rate at the present stage is still far 
from the macrocontrol target, so price control should still be 
intensified. Therefore, macrocontrol should still curb price 
increases while preventing major fluctuations of the economic 
growth rates. However, the complexity of the issue lies in the 
fact that price increases and economic growth are two 
interrelated indicators. In the 15 years of reform and opening, 
high economic growth rates have always gone with high inflation. 
We can also say that, to a certain degree, we are in a dilemma 
trying to curb the price increases at the same time as 
mitigating the difficulties in enterprise operation. If our 
measures for curbing price increase are too serious, economic 
growth can be upset and the state-owned enterprises which are 
operating in difficult conditions may encounter even greater 
difficulties; if we relax control over such major factors of 
economic growth as investments and loans, prices may continue to 
increase. 
  As there is a synchronistic relationship between economic 
growth and price increases, then our macrocontrol guideline 
should, in general, seek the most favorable conjunction of the 
economic growth rate and the price increase rate. That is, to 
keep the economic growth rate between 9 and 10 percent and to 
keep the price increase rate below 10 percent. In the course of 
pursuing this guideline, we should try to restrain the 
disadvantageous and boost the advantageous by curbing the rate 
of price increases and striving for the highest possible rate of 
economic growth. 
  We may first see the possibility of curbing the excessive 
price increases. At present, price increases are mainly caused 
by the following factors: First, owing to the fast economic 
growth, investment-led demand becomes strong and this drives up 
the prices of producer goods and then affects the prices of 
consumer goods; second, in the price reform, the changes in the 
price-forming mechanisms inevitably cause a certain degree of 
price increases; third, in the tax reform, enterprises may shift 
part of their additional tax burdens onto others by raising the 
prices of their products, and some even take advantage of this 
opportunity to reap additional profits by turning some in-price 
taxes [jia nei shui 0116 0355 4451] into out-of-price taxes [jia 
wai shui 0116 1120 4451]; fourth, since price decontrol, the new 
price management mechanisms have not been established and some 
merchants irregularly raise prices when people generally expect 
price increases; and fifth, the unification of the exchange rate 
system has also caused certain price increases. As long as we 
take the right measures to offset the effects of these factors, 
we will be able to bring the upward tendency in prices 
completely under control. 
  First, it is necessary to control the general valve. This 
year, the size of investment in fixed assets is not very large 
and some new projects will soon be started because the size of 
the ongoing construction projects is already too large. 
Therefore, there will be great pressure for the expansion of 
investment. So, it is necessary to strictly control new project 
starts, to control the overall amount of investment, and to 
prevent the further widening of the gap in the working funds. 
This is the key to whether or not this year's macroeconomic 
adjustment and control will score further successes. 
  Second, grasp the opportune moment for the adoption of the 
price reform measures, and prevent the excessive intensiveness 
of such measures which can cause substantial price fluctuations. 
  Third, strive to mitigate the impact of the tax reform on 
prices. It is necessary to properly explain the new tax systems 
to the enterprises, help them understand the details and the new 
calculation methods in order to prevent misunderstandings and 
operation errors which can push prices upward. At the same 
time, we must adopt corresponding measures to stabilize prices 
when the new tax system is adopted and help the enterprises 
offset the impact of the additional tax burdens. 
  Fourth, adopt rigorous legal and administrative means to 
resolutely ban the practice of irregularly raising prices in 
order to seek illicit profits and to punish shops and merchants 
involved in such activities. This is a pressing current task. 
Some merchants wantonly charge exorbitant prices without 
following any rules when fixing prices and their behavior cause 
the general public to panic. If such disorder is not removed in 
good time, it can seriously affect the market stability. At 
present, people in the economic circles generally hope that the 
State Council will adopt the "Antiprofiterring Law" and the 
"Price Law" and rigorously supervise their enforcement. 
  We can also see another key point in the macroeconomic 
policies, that is, how to maintain appropriate high-speed 
economic growth while curbing price increases. This cannot be 
controlled as easily as the price issue, nor is it easy to work 
out an effective and pertinent remedy. Generally speaking, it 
is necessary to keep the basic balance between gross supply and 
gross demand and to prevent the excessive intensiveness of the 
measures for controlling demand. The investment in fixed assets 
should be restrained and should also be preserved. On the basis 
of optimizing the investment structure and raising the 
investment efficiency, we should ensure an appropriate increase 
in investment and should also guarantee the key construction 
projects and meet the needs of the basic industries and the 
infrastructural projects. When providing working funds for 
enterprises bogged down in a predicament, we should pay 
attention to the orientation of the fund flow. It is 
inadvisable to taking only stopgap measures without thoroughly 
solving problems. A set of comprehensive measures should be 
worked out as soon as possible in order to solve the problem 
whereby state-owned enterprises are short of dynamism in their 
operation. Consideration should be given to this issue when the 
comprehensive plan for establishing a modern enterprise system 
is being formulated this year.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhuo (3769 3820): "The Law of Reproduction </F>
and the Mechanism of Market Regulation"] 
  [Text] As a market mechanism for regulating the 
distribution of production factors, the law of value is an 
important regulatory mechanism for invoking the law of 
reproduction. When pursuing the the socialist market economy 
system, we should pay special attention to both the law of value 
and the law of reproduction. Here, the law of reproduction 
refers to the objective inevitability of distributing the 
quantity of labor in society according to a certain proportion. 
In ordinary language, that is, economic development requires a 
balance between gross supply and demand, and a well-balanced 
structure. If this balance and harmonious relationship are 
upset, the law of reproduction is being violated and the benign 
cycle of social reproduction inevitably will be disrupted. 
Therefore, we should make clear the relationship between the law 
of value and the law of reproduction. 
<H5>  Importance Should Be Attached to Both the Law of Value and </H5>
the Law of Reproduction 
  The law of value plays a role in regulating the distribution 
of the production factors in the production of different 
commodities. This regulatory mechanism functions through changes 
in the market price signals. Under the conditions of a market 
economy, commodity prices are determined by two basic factors: 
First, the necessary quantity of labor in society for the 
production of a certain commodity; second, the condition of 
supply and demand with regard to this commodity. Provided the 
necessary quantity of labor in society for the production of a 
certain commodity remains unchanged, what determines the changes 
in the commodity's price is the condition of supply and demand 
in the market. In general, if the supply of a certain commodity 
increases to a degree exceeding market demand, the price of the 
commodity will fall to the level below its value. According to 
this market signal, enterprises will redistribute production 
factors and shift part of their resources from the production of 
the oversupplied commodity to the production of other 
commodities. On the contrary, if the demand for a certain 
commodity increases and the commodity becomes in short supply, 
its price will rise to a level above its value. Enterprises 
then will redistribute production factors according to this 
market signal and will shift more resources to the production of 
the commodity in short supply. From the simplified example, we 
may clearly see three points: 1) It is the objective proportion 
in the law of reproduction that determines whether a certain 
commodity is oversupplied or is in short supply, and this is not 
determined simply by the law of value. 2) It is the objective 
proportion in the law of reproduction that determines how much 
and to where the production factors will be shifted, and this is 
not determined simply by the law of value, either. 3) Being 
determined by the law of reproduction, the law of value is 
turned into a market regulation mechanism for adjusting the 
distribution of production factors among different commodities 
(enterprises and departments). Under the conditions of 
large-scale social conditions, without the invisible hand of 
market regulation, it is hard to smoothly meet the objective 
requirements of the law of reproduction. Therefore, we must 
attach great importance to the regulatory role of the law of 
value, thus ensuring that the market mechanism plays a basic 
role in the distribution of resources. 
  Opinion once held that the law of value did not play any 
regulatory role in the realm of production. I think this is an 
erroneous theoretical generalization, but we also should notice 
the blindness of the law of value. Therefore, the adjustment of 
resource distribution cannot rely merely on the invisible hand 
of the market force; it requires another, visible hand: The 
macro-control mechanism based on social interests. 
<H5>  Maintain the Benign Cycle of Social Reproduction </H5>
  This is a historical subject in the study of Western 
economics over the past nearly 100 years. In the past, Western 
economists stressed simple reliance on the invisible hand in 
order to adjust the distribution of production factors, to 
perfect the realization of the law of reproduction, and to avoid 
economic and unemployment crises caused by overproduction. The 
outbreak of the Great Depression in the capitalist world in the 
1930's proved the thorough failure of this theory. The 
replacement was the academic school represented by Keynes, who 
advocated the market economy with the state's macroeconomic 
intervention. It admitted that without the macro-intervention 
of the state, the invisible hand alone would not be able to 
adjust the distribution of the production factors reasonably, 
would not be able to perfect the realization of the law of 
reproduction, and would not be able to avoid economic and 
unemployment crises. However, the stag-flation in the 
capitalist countries in the 1970's posed a new challenge to 
Keynesian theory. Facts show that the primary precondition for 
maintaining the benign cycle of reproduction is a reasonable 
economic system. The greatest obstacle to the realization of 
the law of reproduction under the capitalist system is the lack 
of effective market demand. This is not a contradiction that 
can be solved by any economic structure. The contradiction is a 
product of the capitalist system, and is a phenomenon derived 
from the law of surplus value of capital. When the capitalist 
class is pursuing the exploitation of surplus value, on one 
hand, it deprives the working class of part of their consumption 
demand; on the other hand, it accumulates a huge quantity of 
capital. When the capital is used to expand reproduction, it 
encounters the contradiction caused by the relatively 
insufficient consumption demand of the working class. This is 
the inherent antagonistic contradiction in the capitalist 
system. Even the most ideal model of the market economy can 
bring about only some stopgap measures to mitigate the 
contradiction, but can never remove it. 
  The effort to realize the law of reproduction under the 
socialist system will encounter no obstacle caused by the 
system, but will encounter theoretical and structural obstacles. 
In the development of the socialist system over the past more 
than 70 years, there were a number of theoretical and structural 
errors. In the 1930's, for example, socialist construction gave 
priority to the development of heavy industry, and the 
production of consumer goods developed very slowly and lagged 
behind the increase in purchasing power. This gave rise to the 
phenomenon of disproportion. Some people regarded this as an 
objective law. This then gave rise to the demand-inflationary 
economy in the form of value and the supply-shortage economy in 
the form of real materials. Both the inflationary economy and 
the shortage economy were specific demonstrations of violations 
of the law of reproduction. The erroneous theory had a 
prevailing impact over a fairly long period of time. 
  Another more serious error was the viewpoint that regarded 
the commodity economy as incompatible with the socialist system, 
holding that only the highly centralized planned economy was 
representative of the essential requirement of the socialist 
system and that only such an economic structure could ensure the 
planned and proportionate development of the national economy. 
According to this viewpoint, under the socialist system, only 
if economic regulation was done artificially by the planning 
mechanism, would the law of reproduction be invoked smoothly, 
and there was no need for any regulation by the market 
mechanism. Moreover, the structure of the planned economy was 
oriented to and served state interests only, and ignored or 
negated enterprise, local, and other interests. Economic 
management was highly centralized in the hands of the state 
authorities. Localities, departments, and enterprises could 
only "eat from the big pot" of the state, and they all stretched 
out their hands to scrabble resources from the state. 
Corresponding to this excessively centralized economic 
structure was the administrative control mechanism in the 
process of macroeconomic management. As a result, the 
enthusiasm of the masses was dampened, and the state also failed 
to guarantee the harmonious and stable development of the 
national economy. 
  In the course of invoking the law of reproduction, a 
socialist country does not encounter the contradiction caused by 
the insufficiency of effective demand; on the contrary, it is 
repeatedly faced with the contradiction caused by the swelling 
effective demand. This is not a problem caused by the system, 
but a structural problem. To solve this contradiction, it is 
necessary to carry out economic structural reform, through which 
state-owned enterprises are changed from government affiliates 
into commodity producers bearing sole responsibility for their 
own profits and losses, and the modern enterprise system can be 
established. At the same time, it is necessary to use the 
market mechanism to conduct economic regulation. However, such 
macroeconomic adjustment must be put in place mainly by economic 
means. Thus, invisible and visible hands will function jointly 
to regulate the operation of the economy, and the development of 
the socialist market economy will meet the requirements of law 
of reproduction and effect a benign cycle of social reproduction.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Chao Wen (6872 2429): "Some Cotton-Growing </F>
Areas in North China Are To Be Moderately Hit by the Bollworms 
of the First Generation--Released in a Report on the Trend of 
Occurrences of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests from May to July 
by the Ministry of Agriculture] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 May (XINHUA) -- This reporter was 
informed by the department concerned under the Ministry of 
Agriculture that since the beginning of spring, the air 
temperature in most localities in east China has been 
comparatively low. Thus, the plant disease and insect pest 
occurrence period generally comes late. In mid and late April, 
the temperature was going up rapidly, it rained more frequently, 
and the occurrences of insect pests rose in succession. Through 
the general investigations of the insect pests and the crop 
growing situations in various localities as well as the central 
meteorological observatory's analysis of weather forecast, it is 
estimated that from May to July, major crops will moderately be 
hit by plant diseases and insect pests. 
  Since the beginning of mid April, most localities in north 
China have generally had rainfalls. Thus, the drought has 
become less serious. This is extremely conducive to the 
emergence of cotton seedlings and the growing of cotton. 
However, this year, the first discovery of the adults of the 
over-wintering bollworms in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, and 
Shaanxi Provinces was earlier than the previous years. Of this, 
that in Shandong Province was two or three days earlier than the 
previous years. The number of moths amounted to 20 at the 
height, noticeably lower than the figure in the corresponding 
period of last year. The bollworm pests of the first generation 
are expected to occur moderately. 
  The powdery mildew of wheat generally appeared in most of 
the 
wheat-growing areas recently. But, the conditions were less 
serious when compared with the corresponding periods of the 
previous years. A period when this disease spreads at a high 
speed is estimated to emerge. The recent investigations 
conducted among Shaanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Provinces 
showed that wheat syrup-sucking worms amounted to a large number 
and their rising activity rate was high. The wheat growing areas 
along the valleys of Huang He, Huai He, and Hai He will be hit 
by the wheatworms moderately or more seriously. The wheat 
growing period in the northern part of Sichuan Province and in 
the areas on the middle and lower reaches of Chang Jiang will 
generally arrive late this year. Since the beginning of May, 
there has been more rainfall in Huang He, Huai He, and Chang 
Jiang valleys. Therefore, the wheat in these areas will 
moderately suffer scab. This year, the base figures of the 
wheat aphids in Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces, north of Huai He, 
are high. The base figures in some of the localities in these 
two provinces reach the peak when compared with those in the 
past years. Wheat head aphids will hit most of the wheat 
growing areas moderately or more seriously. The situation will 
become more serious in some areas along Huang He, Huai He, and 
north China. 
  This spring, the temperature in south China has been low, 
and 
the weather has been cloudy and rainy. So, the rice seedlings 
are growing comparatively late, and excessively more rice 
seedlings are carrying bacterium. Sheath and culm blight of 
rice are to be prevalent in the early rice growing areas in 
south China and those south of Chang Jiang. Rice blast will 
moderately occur in Guangdong, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, and 
Hainan. Rice hoppers will appear in varying degrees in some of 
the early rice growing areas throughout the country. Besides, 
the corn borers of the first generation will appear moderately 
or more seriously in northeast China. The peak time for the 
emergence of adults will occur from late June to mid July. 
  To this end, the Ministry of Agriculture urged that the 
agricultural departments at various levels should pay attention 
to upgrading the understanding about the prevention and control 
of the plant diseases and insect pests, define targets, and 
timely attend to prevention and control. The Ministry of 
Agriculture will organize relevant departments to hold work 
conferences on prevention and control of bollworms and to make a 
unified arrangement for the prevention and control work in an 
effort to reduce the disasters to the minimum.

<F P=106> ["A View on Reforms in the Property Rights of Town and </F>
Township Enterprises" by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture on 1 
April 1994] 
  [Text] Reforms in the property rights of town and township 
enterprises are unfolding in rural areas. To implement 
conscientiously the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, to promote and provide guidance to a 
deepening of the reforms, and to ensure their healthy 
development, we offer the following views: 
<H5>  I. Fully understand the importance and urgency of reforms </H5>
in the property right system of town and township enterprises. 
  The unique operating mechanism of our country's town and 
township enterprises, formed in the course of reform and opening 
up, is not only an important inner engine of growth, but also a 
key promoter of our country's economic structural reforms. As 
our country's socialist market economy system gradually takes 
shape, however, problems surface concerning town and township 
enterprises' operating mechanisms and the enterprise system. 
Chief among these problems is the ambiguous property right 
system in rural collective enterprises: Ownership is shared by 
everybody, while noone is responsible for the enterprise; 
responsibilities for property rights are unclear, and so are the 
respective responsibilities for administrative duties and 
enterprise management; rural administrative leaders frequently 
interfere arbitrarily with enterprises; enterprises are not 
really granted decisionmaking powers; workers' awareness of 
being the masters is weak; the lack of cohesiveness within 
enterprises; and the legal status and economic nature of some 
joint peasant household (cooperative) enterprises and the 
cooperative shares system remain undefined, and their legitimate 
interests thus are left unprotected. If we do not pay serious 
attention to these problems, they will affect and dampen the 
efficient, sustained, rapid, and healthy [gao xiao chi xu kuai 
su jian kang 7559 2400 2170 4958 1816, 6643 1696 1660] 
development of town and township enterprises. 
  To fundamentally solve these problems, further improve and 
optimize enterprise operating mechanisms, and gradually 
establish a modern corporate system, town and township 
enterprises must accelerate the pace of property right reforms 
characterized by the cooperative shares system, make innovations 
in the property right system and operating mechanisms, and 
continually strengthen enterprises' vitality and dynamism. 
<H5>  II. Further clarify the guiding thought and objectives for </H5>
town and township enterprises' property right reforms. 
  The guiding thought for town and township enterprises' 
property right reforms is: With the spirit of the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as the direction, with 
the "three beneficial's" as the standard, and with developing 
the cooperative shares or the joint-stock system as the focus, 
we will further clarify property rights; perfect mechanisms; 
increase vitality; and promote the highly efficient, sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of our country's town and 
township enterprises. 
  The targets for town and township enterprises' property 
right 
reforms are: The rational circulation and optimal composition 
of various production factors in different regions, trades, 
enterprises, and types of ownership so as to ensure that the 
cooperative shares, joint-stock, contract, rental and lease, 
merger, and joint venture systems all can be perfected and can 
develop; that enterprises can become corporate entities with 
genuine independent operations, self-constraint, and 
self-development, and with responsibility for their own profits 
and losses and market competitive entities. This will lead, 
finally, to the establishment of a modern corporate system that 
can meet the objective requirements of a socialist market 
economy and socialized, large-scale production; is clear in 
property rights and responsibility and powers; separates 
administration from management; and employs scientific 
management. 
<H5>  III. Continuously enrich the forms and contents of reforms </H5>
in town and township enterprises' property rights. 
  Reforms in town and township enterprises' property rights 
involve many types of ownership and are a complicated systems 
engineering project. At the present stage, the main forms for 
town and township enterprises' property right reforms are: 1) 
The definition and clarification of property rights. 2) 
Effective property rights transfers. 3) The final realization 
of property rights. 4) The management and supervision of 
property rights. 
  The definition and clarification of property rights are the 
foundation for town and township enterprises' property right 
reforms. In general, we should absorb new shares (including 
individual and corporate shares, and so on) on the basis of 
sound asset evaluations and further clarification in definitions 
of property rights so as to put in place a business organization 
that allows diversification in the forms of property. 
  Effective property rights transfers are a key link in 
property right reforms. Localities with conditions gradually 
must set up property right exchange markets so as to achieve 
effective property rights transfers. For enterprises not yet 
pursuing the cooperative shares or joint-stock systems, the 
basic ways for them to transfer property rights are mergers, 
auctions, bankruptcy, inheritance, and giving away as gifts. In 
the cooperative shares system, property rights generally can be 
transferred through conditional internal shares transfers. 
Joint-stock enterprises operate according to relevant state 
provisions. 
  Property rights ultimately are expressed as actually 
possessing, deriving revenue from, and handling assets by 
property-holders so as to maintain and increase the assets' 
value. The fulfillment of property rights for town and township 
enterprises must comply with the principle of "being driven by 
multiple wheels and operating on multiple tracks," and requires 
the adoption of a company organization and operating mechanism 
in line with the characteristics of a property right-defined 
entity. Individual- and privately run enterprises can operate 
under the combination of ownership and management rights; 
township (town) and village collective enterprises must further 
improve the contract management responsibility system, actively 
pursue the cooperative shares and joint-stock systems, and 
vigorously develop business affiliation and business 
conglomerates so as to raise the operating efficiency of their 
assets. 
  Administrative organs in charge of town and township 
enterprises must strengthen the management and supervision of 
town and township enterprises' property rights, and must 
supervise and inspect the enforcement of state laws, rules and 
regulations, and policies on enterprises' property rights. 
Leaders must participate in the formulation and implementation 
of reforms in the enterprise property right system, do a good 
job in evaluating enterprises' assets and defining property 
rights, handle disputes in enterprises' property rights properly 
and in conjunction with the departments concerned, and protect 
enterprises' legitimate rights and interests. Property- holders 
and operators should realize the management, supervision, and 
use of property rights. 
  The property right system of town and township enterprises 
is 
being innovated continuously, and the form and contents of 
reforms are developing and changing perpetually. We must 
passionately support, correctly guide, actively help, and digest 
and popularize the organizational form of the new enterprise's 
property right created by the broad mass of peasants and 
verified thorugh practice. 
<H5>  IV. Conscientiously solve the difficulties and key problems </H5>
with reforms in the property rights of town and township 
enterprises. 
  At the present stage, the primary and most important form 
for 
town and township enterprises' property right reforms is the 
cooperative shares system. This is a complicated and highly 
policy-related job. We should pay special attention to the 
following problems: 
  1. Do a good job of asset evaluation; it is the foundation 
of property right reforms. Asset evaluations should be aimed at 
correctly determining the value of an enterprise's assets and at 
guaranteeing the legitimate rights and interests of asset 
holders and operators; should observe the principles of 
authenticity, scientificalness, and feasibility; and refer to 
the standards, procedures, and methods provided by the state. 
Evaluations generally must be led by administrative departments 
one level higher than town and township enterprises, and require 
setting up an asset evaluation office that should consist mainly 
of personnel qualified in asset evaluations, and of village, 
enterprise, and worker representatives. Evaluation work should 
be done in the order of establishing the object for evaluation, 
asset screening and inspection, evaluations and assessments, and 
verification; its scope should include tangible and intangible 
assets. Methods for evaluations are tailored to the original 
and net value, degrees of newness, replacement cost, and 
profitability of the assets. Specifically, these include the 
present earnings value method, the replacement cost method, the 
present market value method, the liquidation value method, and 
other evaluation methods. 
  2. A rational shareholder composition. The owners of town 
and township enterprises' assets are varied, and they should be 
determined on the basis of relations between rationally 
ascertained asset holdings (including evaluated carryover assets 
and increases in new assets). In general, there can be village 
shares, individual shares, social corporate shares, and 
foreign-capital shares. In pursuing the cooperative shares 
system, rural collective enterprises must offer village and 
individual shares; other shares are offered subject to the 
investment structure. 
  Depending on needs, after a rural collective enterprise has 
changed over to the cooperative shares system, it can offer 
ordinary and preference shares, with their respective rights and 
dividends clearly defined. 
  3. Clarify property right relations. In pursuing the 
cooperative shares system, rural enterprises must clarify the 
property right to their stock assets. The general principle is 
that whoever makes the investment owns it, a respect for the 
history of the development of the enterprise, and consultation 
on an equal footing. There is no need to trace how the former 
enterprise got hold of its stock assets, which can be allocated 
between village shares and individual shares for the 
enterprise's workers. 
  Dividends for village shares are used mainly for developing 
enterprises, the projects of subsidizing and developing 
agriculture with industry, and social charities, but they cannot 
be used to cover the administrative expenditure of township 
(town) governments. As for clarity in property rights, the 
property right holder of village shares is to some extent 
"postulated." In this regard localities may explore boldly, as 
long as it benefits enterprise development. 
  The workers' individual shares included in the individual 
shares come from two parts: One is from capital or other assets 
invested by individual workers, and shares offered to match this 
part of contribution are the same as social individual shares. 
The other comes from a certain proportion of what has been 
determined, in asset evaluations, as the stock assets of the 
original enterprise. The ownership and corresponding shares of 
this proportion of assets should be given to workers according 
to their contributions toward the establishment of the 
enterprises, their seniority, and their work responsibility. 
This kind of workers' individual shares can only generate 
dividends and cannot be inherited, given away as gifts, or 
transferred. Holders of these kinds of shares are seen as 
giving them up when they leave the enterprise for personal 
reasons. 
  4. Do a good job in the distribution of interests. The 
rural cooperative and shares system is a special business 
organization. Care must be taken to take into account the 
interests of the state, enterprises, workers, and shareholders; 
to combine distribution according to work with dividends 
according to shares; and to handle profit distribution 
reasonably. First, pay income taxes according to the law. 
Second, pay compensation for confiscated goods, as well as all 
tax arrears and fines. Third, make up the previous annual 
losses incurred by the enterprise in question. Fourth, withdraw 
money from the public and welfare funds in accordance with 
current relevant provisions. Fifth, withdraw money from the 
discretionary public fund, the amount of withdrawal determined 
by the shareholder general meeting or board of directors. 
Sixth, shares and dividend distribution should be such as that 
dividends match shares, with equal sharing in interests and 
risk. Ordinary shareholders should bear the brunt of risk for 
the enterprise, and returns on their shares may vary according 
to the risk taken, so that dividends may rise or fall in 
proportion to the enterprise's economic returns. Preference 
shares may be calculated on an interest-guaranteed and 
dividend-sharing basis, but the total sum of share interests and 
dividends must not exceed the rate of returns on the 
enterprise's total assets. 
  5. Integrate organically the cooperative shares system with 
the contract system. The cooperative shares system helps 
overcome the problem of short-sighted behaviors prompted by the 
contract system, such as reaping profits without bearing losses. 
In view of the fact that the contract system is still a major 
operating mechanism in rural collective enterprises where it 
plays an active role, enterprises not yet prepared to pursue the 
cooperative shares system should increase their efforts to 
improve the contract system by introducing, one at a time, the 
procedures and methods of the cooperative shares system, seeing 
the improvement of the contract system as a means of promoting 
the cooperatives shares system, and being ready to move into the 
cooperative shares system once conditions permit. Enterprises 
capable of pursuing the cooperative shares system can introduce 
some of the shareholding system into the contract system, so 
that the enterprise can have the advantages of both the contract 
system and the cooperative shares system, and can integrate the 
two organically. 
  6. Handle well the relations between rural administrative 
organizations and enterprises pursuing the cooperative shares 
system. As a new form of business organization, the cooperative 
shares system differs from the traditional rural collective 
enterprise. Rural administrative and economic organizations 
cannot manage these enterprises with the traditional management 
methods they use with rural collective enterprises. They must 
try hard not to interfere administratively and should be 
concerned mainly with providing guidance, supervision, and 
coordinated services. They should monitor enterprises' 
enforcement and implementation of state laws, rules and 
regulations, and policies; arrange for management for 
enterprises; guide them concerning work in this area, together 
with the departments concerned; coordinate relations between 
enterprises; help secure economic and technological cooperation; 
sum up and popularize enterprises' experiences in development; 
mobilize and guide enterprises on how to strengthen ideological 
and political work; promote spiritual civilization in 
enterprises; and create essential conditions for enterprises to 
train and recruit professional and technical staff and to 
introduce advanced technology. Enterprises pursuing the 
cooperative shares system or joint-stock system also should 
handle well their relations with rural administrative and 
economic organizations, voluntarily accept their guidance and 
supervision, and contribute to local economic pursuits and the 
common good. 
  7. Define the administrative and management responsibilities 
of town and township enterprise administrative departments to 
the rural cooperative shares system. The pursuit of the 
cooperative shares system by town and township enterprises is a 
reform and innovation in enterprises' business organization,and 
does not change the nature of town and township enterprises. 
Therefore, the subordination relation still remains for 
enterprises; planning, guidance, management, supervision, and 
coordinated services are still done by town and township 
enterprise administrative departments. Enterprises of the town 
and township cooperative shares system should fulfil their 
obligations according to the "PRC Regulations on Rural 
Collective-Ownership Enterprises." 
<H5>  V. Genuinely strengthen leadership over reforms in the </H5>
property rights of town and township enterprises. 
  A significant change in itself, reform in the property 
rights 
of town and township enterprises involves adjustment in the 
interests of varied parties, and is a job with strong policy 
import, cutting across many sectors. Town and township 
enterprise administrative departments at all levels must fully 
appreciate the importance of town and township enterprises for 
property right reforms and the complicated nature of the task; 
include this job on their agendas; and genuinely strengthen 
leadership, especially in inducing rural and enterprise leaders 
ideologically in an attempt to help them overcome ideological 
barriers, heighten the sense of reform and opening up, and raise 
awareness in pursuing property right reforms. Leaders at all 
levels must be personally involved in pilot schemes, sum up 
experiences, insist on seeking truth from facts, tailor measures 
to local conditions, vary guidance according to different areas 
of work, and refrain uniform and sweeping applications. Town 
and township enterprise administrative departments at all levels 
must make clear who and which organs are responsible for this 
task, must actively seek support from party committees at the 
same level, and provide policy and legal protection for reforms 
in the property rights of town and township enterprises. Under 
the unified leadership of party committees and governments, they 
must work in coordination with the departments concerned, 
cooperate fully, pursue well reforms town and township 
enterprises' property rights, and work vigorously to achieve 
major breakthroughs in this work.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Xiaohui (3769 2556 2547): "'Green Paper' </F>
Calls For Augmenting Financial Support to China's Agriculture"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The 1993-94 
China Rural Economy Development Yearbook, which is also called 
the economic "Green Paper," was published here recently. Apart 
from presenting an analysis and forecast, the "Green Paper" 
calls for more financial support for agriculture. 
  This second economic "Green Paper" presented by the rural 
economy annual analysis project group jointly run by the 
Institute of Rural Development of the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences and the Statistical Department of Rural Economy of the 
State Statistical Bureau provides descriptions, analyses, and 
relevant comparisons, rendered in the most objective manner 
possible, of all aspects of the Chinese rural economy last year, 
and a brief forecast of this year's development. 
  The report holds that the year 1993 saw quite rapid growth 
in 
the general level of agricultural production, and the 
agricultural output composition experienced another remarkable 
adjustment. The growth rate of nonagricultural sectors in rural 
areas reached unprecedented heights. 
  Over the past year, industry and tertiary industry's share 
of 
the output value and labor force of rural areas continued to 
increase. The major regions of East, Central, and West China 
generally matched each other in terms of the high growth rate of 
township and town enterprises, whereas the gap between different 
regions continued to widen in the per-capita income of the 
peasants. The consumer goods sales volume on the rural market 
grew at a relatively low and stable rate, while commodity prices 
soared rapidly, input in agriculture dropped, rural areas were 
faced with a shortage of funds, and the macroeconomic regulation 
and control of agriculture was less effective... 
  The "Green Paper" discloses that the state's financial 
outlay 
on agriculture was more than 43 billion yuan last year, an 
increase of more than 7 percent over the previous year. Of this 
outlay, about 13 billion yuan was spent on agricultural capital 
construction, an increase of 16.4 percent over the previous 
year, but this turned out to be a negative growth with the 
inflation factor taken into account. 
  Therefore, increasing financial support for agriculture has 
now been placed on the important agenda. A stronger appeal was 
made by some high-ranking officials and experts present at 
today's "Green Paper" symposium, co-sponsored by the Institute 
of Rural Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 
the YAO BAO [6008 1032; IMPORTANT NEWS] editorial department, 
and the Statistical Department of Rural Economy of the State 
Statistical Bureau. 
  Forecasting this year's gross agricultural output value, the 
"Green Paper" says the growth rate of the gross agricultural 
output value will range from 3.5 to 6.5 percent, depending on 
how good the harvest is this year. The gross output value 
contributed by township and town enterprises and the gross 
output value of rural areas will range from 25 to 30 percent and 
from 15 to 20 percent respectively, varying from place to place 
and depending on local macroeconomic development conditions. 
The real growth in the per-capita income of peasants is 
expected to be 3 to 4 percent. 
  Referring to this year's rural economic development, the 
"Green Paper" says grain production may experience fluctuation, 
the growth in the peasants' income will still be quite low, and 
the output-employment flexibility [chan chu jiu ye tan xing 3934 
0427 1432 2814 1734 1840] for nonagricultural sectors will still 
be very low. 
  The "Green Paper" maintains that apart from giving more 
financial support to agriculture, it is also necessary to 
maintain a stable farming technique promotion team; minimize the 
impact of inflation on the peasants' income; expedite the 
comprehensive development of tertiary industry and small towns 
in rural areas; and stabilize agricultural production. 
  The "Green Paper" holds that, in the next 10 years or more, 
only by making efforts in four aspects--developing good-quality 
high- return agriculture, speeding up the urbanization process, 
expediting the development of tertiary industry in rural areas, 
and building up regional composite networks for production, 
processing, and marketing of good-quality high-return 
agricultural products--will China be able to gradually solve the 
two problems of low relative profitability of agriculture and 
low relative fluidity of the agricultural labor force, and thus 
begin, in the second decade of the next century, the process of 
a substantial and continuous decrease in the agricultural 
population.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhang Pan (1728 4323), researcher at State </F>
Council's Development Research Center: "Market Economy and 
Opening to Outside World"] 
  [Text] The advancement of theory on the socialist market 
economy has laid a theoretical foundation for expanding opening 
up to the outside world, and reforms which aim to establish a 
market economy system will create conducive conditions for the 
rapid development of foreign trade. 
  Since reform and opening up, our system has experienced 
great 
changes. However, the relationship between planning and the 
market is still a kind of contradiction which hinders our 
efforts to deepen reform and rapidly develop the productive 
forces. When this contradiction is manifested in the area of 
opening up to the outside world, it mainly shows that many of 
our practices are still unable to converge with the 
international market. Fixing the goal of establishing a 
socialist market economy system will help enable our country's 
open-door policy to enter a new stage. 
  The main features of this new stage are: 
  1. Use the opportunity arising from the restoration of our 
country's status as a signatory to the GATT to foster closer and 
firmer economic and trade ties between our country and various 
countries in the world, and to enable our country to play a more 
active role in economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Our country's work in struggling for the restoration of its 
signatory status to the GATT has made important progress. China 
has formally raised the goal of building a socialist market 
economy system, thus removing the biggest obstacle which has 
hindered our country's "entry to the GATT" for a long time. We 
have also committed ourselves to increasing the transparency of 
our foreign trade system and reducing non-tariff protective 
measures, and this shows that at the same time as we enjoy the 
rights which come with the GATT, we have the ability to shoulder 
and discharge the various obligations associated with the GATT. 
"Entrance to the GATT" will enable our country's trade 
relations with various countries to be built on a foundation 
which has multilateral protection and is more stable. 
  2. Further implement the strategy of diversifying our 
foreign trade markets and winning competition with quality. 
China's status in world trade will rise further. 
  In 1992, our country's total import and export volume 
surpassed that of Spain and the ROK, and we leaped two positions 
among the major world trade powers, to 11th position. In the 
1990's, when engaging in export trade, we must attach importance 
to exploring new markets in the developed countries and regions 
and pay even more attention to markets in the developing 
countries and neighboring countries and regions, including 
markets in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, 
the Gulf countries, and the CIS. For this reason, we must 
earnestly tackle the acute contradiction which constrains our 
efforts to expand exports--the problem of product quality. Poor 
quality products are not salable in the international market 
even at low prices, while good-quality products are marketable 
even though they are sold at high prices. 
  3. Participate more actively in the international division 
of labor. Along with a marked increase in the proportion of 
high-tech and value-added products among exports, and with the 
gradual opening up of the domestic market, the development of 
the national economy will have a greater degree of linkage to 
the international market. 
  In the 1990's, the application of new technology in the 
world 
will make a series of breakthroughs, and materials technology, 
biotechnology, information and communications technology, 
astronautics and aeronautical technology, marine exploration 
technology, and energy technology will all be used in industry. 
This will cause a new revolution in the production domain, while 
the focus of competition in international markets will 
concentrate more on high and new technology, while the status of 
resource-intensive and labor-intensive industries will decline 
in the international division of labor and technology-intensive 
and knowledge-intensive industries will acquire an increasingly 
dominant position in the international division of labor. 
Facing this grim challenge, we should grasp the opportunity 
arising from the adjustment of the industrial structure in the 
international community to give full play to our country's 
scientific and technological strength, integrate self-determined 
scientific and technological exploration with the importation of 
advanced technology from abroad, and form our own high and 
new-technology industries. 
  At the same time, with an eye on the adjustment of the 
industrial structure at home, we must selectively open up the 
domestic market, introduce competition, and gradually cancel the 
protection of an absolute majority of enterprises which have 
some foundation and competitive ability in order to allow them 
to develop themselves during their participation in 
international competition. 
  4. Further expand the scale of the utilization of foreign 
capital. There will be a marked increase in large-scale 
investment projects, more capital-intensive and 
technology-intensive investment projects, and investment 
projects which can promote the development of tertiary industry. 
This can help adjust the structure of industries which have 
foreign investment and enable foreign capital to flow to those 
sectors whose development is being encouraged by our country's 
industrial policy; and this can help change the structure of 
regions which have foreign investments and increase investment 
in central and western China. 
  5. In the course of foreign economic and technological 
exchanges, the "great economic and trade" pattern in which 
commodities, funds, technology, and labor are combined, promote 
one another, and develop together will emerge. Enterprises will 
be able to operate businesses which transcend different trades, 
to combine trade in industrial products and trade in technology 
with trade in commodities and trade in science, and to follow 
the road of professionalism, conglomeration, and 
internationalization. 
  6. Opening up to the outside world will lead to a "network" 
in which coastal areas, borders, rivers, and transportation 
routes are opened up, and the policy of opening up the regions 
will change to one which covers the whole country. 
  7. Participate in regional cooperation with an active and 
pragmatic attitude. Economic and trade links among the 
mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan will become closer, and 
an economic cooperation pattern characterized by reciprocity, 
mutual support, common development, and common prosperity will 
gradually emerge in South China. 
  Between the "global unification" of the world economy and 
regional groupings are relations of mutual promotion and mutual 
restraint. The process of regional grouping itself has a lot of 
unclear factors due to the meeting and contradiction of state 
interests and group interests. China is a developing country in 
the Asia-Pacific region and is enthusiastic about participation 
in economic cooperation of various types in the region; at the 
same time, China agrees to the establishment of a nonpolitical 
and nonmilitary regional cooperation plans and to the idea that 
economic cooperation should be open and development should be 
orderly and practical. In the 1990's, efforts will be made to 
further develop cooperative relations. We must create 
conditions for continuing to develop economic and trade 
exchanges across the strait, realize the goal of direct and 
bilateral "three links" step by step, and foster closer economic 
ties with Hong Kong and Macao. 
  8. Enterprise groups specializing in trades and enterprise 
groups specializing in industries will become the backbone force 
in the development of an export-oriented economy, and a number 
of enterprises will walk through the country's door to carry out 
international operations. 
  Transnational operations by enterprises is a major trend of 
global economic development, and our country is still at the 
starting stage. By the end of 1992, excluding the Hong Kong and 
Macao regions, our country had some 2,400 overseas enterprises 
and the Chinese had invested $1.85 billion, but most of these 
enterprises were small in scale and had poor returns. In the 
1990's, when a number of large enterprises will walk through the 
country's door to invest in larger projects and industries, such 
as resources, construction, processing and assembling 
industries, trade, and overseas commerce, the advantages of 
enterprises' transnational operations will be more fully 
embodied. 
  9. When the market's role in allocating resources 
increasingly expands, when a managed exchange rate mechanism in 
the market is eventually established, and when direct government 
intervention in economic activities, such as the import and 
export trades, is reduced, the domestic market will gradually 
converge with the international market. 
  The goal of reform is to establish a managed foreign 
exchange 
market, practice a unitary market exchange rate, and gradually 
allow the yuan to be freely exchanged with foreign currencies. 
To expand opening up, we must more effectively develop the 
regulatory function of the interest rate mechanism, expand the 
scope and function of the foreign exchange adjustment market, 
and establish a stabilization fund. On the basis of narrowing 
the difference between the two exchange rates step by step, this 
year, our country eventually combined the two exchange rates 
into one. The merger of the two exchange rates and the 
establishment of a foreign exchange market indicates that the 
domestic market has begun to converge with the international 
market. 
  10. A new operation and management system in foreign trade 
in which the state formulates policies and measures and carries 
out indirect macroregulation and control; enterprises operate at 
their own discretion, take sole responsibility for profits and 
losses, and develop and restrain themselves; and chambers of 
commerce carry out coordination and provide services according 
to the interests and demands of members, will take shape. 
  The above-mentioned 10 features are only a rough sketch of 
the great blueprint of our country's opening up to the outside 
world in the course of building a socialist market economy in 
the 1990's. But from this we can also see that when China 
upholds reform and opening up, it has a series of concrete 
arrangements and solid actions.

  [Text] Beijing, May 18 (XINHUA) -- China National Offshore 
Oil Corporation (CNOOC) is inviting foreign oil companies to a 
new acreage promotion in which 13 blocks in the South China Sea 
are offered. 
  This is the first acreage promotion held by the CNOOC, 
following four rounds of international bidding for offshore oil 
and gas exploration and development. The 13 blocks, with a 
combined area of 40,000 square kilometers, are situated in the 
basins of the Pearl river mouth, Yinggehai and Qiong Dongnan in 
the South China Sea. 
  Gong Zaisheng, CNOOC's chief geologist, told XINHUA that the 
principal objective of this acreage promotion was to expand 
offshore oil and gas exploration, and his corporation would 
present the geology of the blocks and the key targets for 
exploration. 
  A total of 33 targets have been initially selected inside 
the 
blocks, he revealed, adding that CNOOC will answer questions on 
the promotion and discuss technological issues with companies 
interested in specific blocks. 
  He said the blocks in the Yinggehai and Qiong Dongnan basins 
have good natural gas prospects. These blocks, originally 
reserved for self-financed exploration, are now being promoted 
only because of some inadequacies in funding and technology. 
  He said that especially the deep stratum in the region, so 
far barely drilled because of high temperature and pressure, is 
considered an exploration domain with great potential. 
  On the other hand, he said, the blocks in the pearl river 
mouth basin were redefined, after careful analysis and 
evaluation by Chinese experts, to include a batch of hopeful 
targets for exploration. 
  CNOOC has told 80 foreign companies about the promotion, and 
it was well received, said Gong, who is expected to head a 
delegation to the United States for the promotion from June 20 
to 24. 
  A seminar will be held in Adam's Mark Hotel, Houston, on 
June 
20, followed by detailed technical exchanges and discussions, 
Gong added. 
  The oil companies will not need to worry about marketing 
their products from natural gas exploration and development in 
Yinggehai and Qiong Dongnan, he said, adding that the market in 
the coastal area is vast. 
  CNOOC is considering the construction of a gas pipeline, as 
soon as enough deposits are discovered, to link all the big 
cities along the coast in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and 
Hainan. "This long-distance pipeline will give the gas to be 
produced access to the market," Gong said. 
  The CNOOC signed 94 agreements and contracts with 55 oil 
companies from 15 countries over the past ten years. Altogether 
78 oil and gas-bearing structures have been discovered on 
China's continental shelf, through cooperative and self-financed 
exploration. 
  So far 1.2 billion tons of oil in place, and 180 billion 
cubic meters of natural gas have been proven and controlled, 
according to experts. The daily crude output of the corporation 
has risen to 130,000 barrels, bringing the projected total for 
this year to 5.5 million tons. 
  By 1997, the CNOOC is expected to produce 265,000 barrels of 
crude and 10 million cubic meters of gas each day, experts said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Experts estimate that 
China will have an initial information sharing market by the 
year 2000. 
  It will enable individuals to exchange a wide range of 
information with each other and society at large via computer 
terminals and telephones, said Xu Zuzhe, secretary-general of 
the Beijing Information Industry Association. 
  "It signals that China is in a transitional period in 
building its information highway," he said at a high-tech 
exhibition to celebrate the international telecommunications day 
here today. 
  New services in telecommunications have grown fast these 
years, he said, including E-mail systems, which have attracted 
their first groups of users in Beijing and Shanghai. 
  And China is building its first public packet switching data 
network, with 36,000 km being completed last year. 
  "Auto audio services have been adapted to the fields of 
securities, bank systems, and wireless paging," said Guan 
Xuemei, general manager of the Beijing Shining Star Company, a 
main producer of auto audio technology. 
  In addition, Xu's association is discussing the possibility 
of designing an electronic bulletin board for public rentals. 
The bulletin board can provide news as well as other 
information through a computer network nationwide. 
  Countless information companies are rushing onto the market, 
including foreign firms such as the Dow Jones Company of the U.S. 
  "The expansion of the public information market goes in line 
with the people's improved living standards," said Li Rujiang, 
vice general manager of the Shenzhen Oriental Co. Ltd. he added 
that in recent years, more Chinese families have gained access 
to telephones, personal computers, and fax facilities. 
  Guan Xuemei said that the government's decision to speed up 
the development of the service industry has quickened 
information flow. 
  Statistics show that the posts and telecommunications sector 
has remained the fastest growth sector in China -- last year it 
was up 59 percent over 1992.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Preparatory work 
has started on the construction of a new trunk railway line from 
Handan city, in north China's Hebei Province, to Jinan, 
provincial capital of east China's Shandong Province. 
  The new railway line will have a total length of 234 km and 
will be jointly constructed by Hebei and Shandong provinces and 
the Ministry of Railways, with a total investment of 1.53 
billion yuan (about 175.86 million U.S. dollars). 
  The construction will be carried out in two phases -- a 
single line for the first-phase construction and double-tracking 
in the second phase. 
  When it is completed, the new railway line, the west end of 
which be linked to the existing coal transport railway lines to 
Shanxi Province, China's leading coal producer, will help 
transport 20 million tons of goods a year, and three pairs of 
passenger trains will be able to operate on the line a day. 
  Experts here say the construction of the new railway is of 
special importance not only for transporting coal from Shanxi 
but also for further improving transportation conditions in the 
hinterland of China.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "South China Sea Fisheries To Face More </F>
Supervision"] 
  [Text] China will increase survey work and strengthen 
supervision of fisheries in the South China Sea, an agricultural 
official said yesterday. 
  "It is very important to safeguard the rights of Chinese 
fishermen in the area and protect the region's rich marine 
resources," said Zhuo Youzhan of the Ministry of Agriculture, 
which oversees the fishing industry. 
  The heightened attention on the South China Sea comes after 
a 
recent fishery inspection of the Nansha Islands [Spratlys], the 
first conducted in the area since 1949. 
  The 37 crew members, sent by the Ministry of Agriculture, 
returned to Guangzhou Port in Guangdong Province on May 10 after 
a 21-day exploration of 3,398 nautical miles. 
  During the trip, they enforced maritime regulations and 
compiled a survey of fishery resources and weather patterns, 
said Zhuo, who is director of the Fishery Bureau. 
  The data will provide information for the protection and 
future development of local marine resources as well as for the 
supervision of fishermen in the area, he said. 
  The Nansha Islands, a traditional fishing ground for Chinese 
fishermen, are rich in eel, red porgy, reeves shad, prawn and 
other aquatic life. 
  Every year more than 300 fishing boats enter the area from 
Guangdong and Hainan provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Nationality 
Autonomous Region. But the lack of proper supervision has led 
to repeated disputes over fishing territory, Zhuo said, adding 
that this is a top concern. 
  It is important to develop the rich fisheries with foreign 
co- operation, he said, adding that China should increase 
seafood production to meet increasing home market demand and 
relieve fishing pressure in the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea and East 
China Sea, which have suffered from overfishing in recent years. 
  The population of favorite ocean delicacies such as croakers 
and hairtails there has sharply declined in recent years. 
  China has ranked first in the world in seafood output since 
1990, Zhuo said, and the per-capita consumption of seafood rose 
to 14.7 kilograms last year from 4.4 kilograms in 1979.

  [Text] Jinan -- East China's Shandong Province is to 
honour its best-behaved prisoners later this month at its 
second-ever provincial meeting on inmate conduct. 
  About 250 inmates chosen from Shandong's 57,000 convicts at 
prisons and reform-through-labour camps will be honoured for the 
occasion, said Liu Zhengxin, deputy director of the Justice 
Bureau. 
  About a third of them will have their terms reduced or be 
released on parole, Liu added. 
  Those who excel in their work, reeducation study and daily 
life in prisons usually receive better treatment than other 
prisoners. 
  The province hopes the meeting encourages more inmates to 
behave better in prisons and reform-through-labour institutions, 
Liu added.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai now claims 76 
enterprises launched by Chinese students returned from overseas, 
who have been encouraged by preferential policies endorsed by 
the local government. 
  So far, over 1,000 people back from abroad have lined up for 
official approval to set up their own companies. 
  These firms, featuring high technology, are involved in the 
fields of information, advertising, consultancy and tourism. 
Three-quarters of these returned students have masters' degrees 
or doctorates obtained abroad. 
  Doctor Ni Xuanzhong, who has initiated a company of 
"intelligent machines", is trying to develop an innovatory 
scanner for Chinese characters, which can read 400 characters 
per second. 
  Another new product developed by the company is capable of 
linking six pairs of telephone users using just one line, 
relieving the shortage of lines in the region. 
  Doctor Jiang Qinguo, licensed lawyer who studied in New 
York, 
has established a consultancy firm to offer advice and act as 
agent to Chinese and foreign businessmen, at home and abroad. 
  Luo Yan, nationally-renowned actress who has just finished 
eight years of studying in the United States, has invested 
100,000 U.S. dollars to set up an entertainment firm, prompting 
program exchanges with television and broadcasting stations in 
foreign countries. 
  The city has set aside special areas in some development 
zones, wishing that more and more overseas students will bring 
in investment and their knowledge and skills.

<F P=106> ["Zhejiang Carries Out Propaganda Activities Marking 10th </F>
Anniversary of Promulgation of `Military Service Law'"] 
  [Text] The Propaganda Department of the Zhejiang 
Provincial Party Committee and the headquarters and political 
department of the Zhejiang Military District recently issued a 
joint circular calling on the entire province to carry out 
propaganda and educational activities on the occasion of the 
10th anniversary of promulgation of the "Military Service Law." 
  The circular pointed out: The "Military Service Law" is the 
basic law of our military system. Since its promulgation, the 
current "Military Service Law" has played an important role in 
perfecting our socialist legal system and our military service 
system, promoting the modernization of our armed forces, and 
strengthening the reserve force. In the new situation in which 
we are deepening reform and establishing a socialist market 
economic structure, to further seriously implement the "Military 
Service Law" is of great immediate significance to stepping up 
national defense construction, promoting the all-people national 
defense concept, raising citizens' awareness of their military 
service duties, and spreading patriotism and revolutionary 
heroism. On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the 
promulgation of the "Military Service Law," all localities and 
all units should do solid and effective work in publicizing it 
in light of their realities. With these propaganda activities, 
we should strive to encourage all people to show concern for 
national defense construction and support national defense 
construction; we should make all officers and men dedicate 
themselves to the cause of national defense; and we should lay 
an ideological foundation for promoting the implementation of 
the law and for promoting the building of the military district 
units and the province's reserve force.

  [Text] A provincial work meeting on the management of 
ground facilities for reception of satellite television 
broadcasts opened in Changsha yesterday [12 May]. In this 
meeting, the participant mainly studied and implemented Order 
No. 129 of the State Council and Order No. 11 of the Ministry of 
Radio, Film and Television, and made arrangements for the 
management of ground facilities for reception of satellite 
television broadcasts. (Wen Xuande), member of the standing 
committee of the provincial party committee and director of the 
provincial propaganda department; Vice Governor (Zeng Guiyu); 
and others attended and addressed the meeting. 
  The meeting pointed out: At present, more than 20 satellite 
television programs from outside the border are receivable in 
China, and 13 television programs are receivable in our province 
via satellite. With the increase of satellite television 
broadcast channels, there are more and more ground reception 
facilities. Owing to the fact that in the past, China lacked 
perfect laws and decrees for the management of these facilities, 
a number of units and individuals have watched, via such ground 
reception facilities, programs with vulgar or even reactionary 
contents which harmed the building of our socialist spiritual 
civilization. The State Council's regulations on the management 
of ground reception facilities for satellite television 
broadcasts have placed the management of ground reception 
facilities under the procedures of the legal system. This is 
beneficial to maintaining the principle of administering the 
country characterized by doing two types of work simultaneously 
while attaching equal importance to both. these also are 
important measures for exercising and safeguarding our country's 
territorial air sovereignty so as to ensure that our satellite 
television broadcasting develops in a healthy and orderly way.

  [Text] Xining, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Qinghai Province had exported 35.81 million U.S. dollars-worth 
of commodities by May 10, an increase of 39.5 percent compared 
with the corresponding period of last year. 
  The increase rate is also higher than the national growth 
rate of 22 percent for exports in the past four months, said 
local trade officials. 
  Meanwhile, imports in the same period were worth 11.92 
million U.S. dollars, a decrease of 40,000 U.S. dollars over the 
same period of last year. 
  The officials attributed the growth in exports in the first 
four months of this year to the implementation of reform 
measures in foreign trade. 
  They said they believed that the unification of foreign 
exchange rates and other foreign trade reform measures have 
provided favorable conditions for the development of enterprises 
engaged in foreign trade and have brought the enthusiasm of 
these enterprises into full play.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Various preparations 
for construction of the Shenfu-Huanghua project, involving a 
total investment of over 40 billion yuan (about 4.6 billion U.S. 
dollars) are drawing to an end and full-scale construction of 
the project will soon start. 
  The project includes further development of the 
Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield in northwest China's Shaanxi 
Province, which will have a total production capacity of more 
than 100 million tons a year; construction of the 
Shenfu-Huanghua railway with a total length of 820 km; and 
construction of the Huanghua port on the Bohai Sea in north 
China, which will have an annual handling capacity of 100 
million tons of coal. 
  The project is aimed at transporting the fine-quality coal 
from the Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield to the eastern part of the 
country. 
  The Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield already has a yearly 
production capacity of 10 million tons. The second-stage 
development of coal mines with a total annual capacity of 30 
million tons has been listed as one of the 151 national major 
projects for 1994. 
  The Shenmu-Shuoxian section of the Shenfu-Huanghua railway 
has already gone into operation. The design of the electrified 
multiple-track Shuoxian-Huanghua railway has been completed 
thanks to the efforts of over 300 designers over the past 
several months. Now, a 1,000-member survey team is making the 
final survey along the railway line to pave the way for the 
start of the construction. 
  Work on overall design of the Huanghua port is now in full 
swing. Meanwhile, preparations for construction of the 
supplementary projects of the port such as power and water 
supply projects and telecommunications and communications 
networks will soon be completed.

  [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- The Taiwan High Court 
Thursday [19 May] cut the jail terms for two mainland Chinese 
hijackers from 10 years to seven years. 
  Liu Baocai, 24, and Huang Shugang, 30, hijacked a China 
Southern Airlines' Boeing 757 to Taiwan en route from Shenzhen 
to Beijing on April 5, 1993, marking the first of ten mainland 
hijackings in 1993. 
  Liu and Huang were sentenced to 10 years in prison by a 
Taoyuan District Court, but they appealed to the Taiwan High 
Court, and the High Court upheld the sentence. 
  Liu and Huang then appealed to the Supreme Court. The 
Supreme Court returned the case to the Taiwan High Court for 
retrial. On Thursday, the High Court cut their sentences from 
10 to seven years, saying the hijackers deserved leniency 
because they surrendered without resistance. 
  Judge Wang Hsi-pao of the Taiwan High Court told them that 
they could be paroled after serving slightly more than two years 
in jail. 
  Liu and Huang said they would appeal the decision.

  [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- The main opposition 
Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] on Friday [13 May] finalized 
its proposal for constitutional change, recommending that the 
Republic of China [ROC] adopt a single-parliament system and do 
away with the National Assembly, among other changes. 
  The DPP's National Assembly Caucus submitted the proposal, 
which is also being supported by several nonpartisan and 
Kuomintang Assembly members, to the National Assembly 
Secretariat. 
  National Assembly members are gathering in Yangmingshan in 
suburban Taipei for a three-month special meeting to consider 
constitutional changes and the nominations of grand justices and 
the head of the Judicial Yuan. 
  Of the DPP's 31-article proposal, only the one that 
recommends election of the ROC president and vice president by 
popular vote is shared by the ruling Kuomintang. 
  Other major points of the DPP proposal include allowing 
national referendums, abolishing existing nuclear power plants, 
judiciary reforms, and doing away with the quota for overseas 
Chinese parliamentary members. 
  The KMT, which controls a majority of assembly seats, has 
decided to push ahead with its own version of constitutional 
changes, including the election of an assembly speaker and vice 
speaker, extension of legislators' tenure from three years to 
four, and granting overseas Chinese the right to vote in the 
presidential election.

  The three civilian representatives include professor Wang 
Ing 
of the National Taiwan Normal University biology department, Jay 
Fang of the Green Consumer Foundation, and Ted Ding of the 
Beautiful Taiwan Foundation. The three were in Beijing for the 
May 16-18 CITES Animals Committee meeting. 
  Ding said Taiwan hopes to establish a long-term relationship 
with CITES through attendance at such meetings. 
  Nearly 60 representatives from more than 20 countries 
participated the cites animals committee meeting in Beijing. 
Resolutions adopted at the meeting will be discussed at the 1994 
cites meeting in Florida this November.

  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan's booming export 
years are fading. 
  As exports continue to slide, Taiwan's trade surplus this 
year is expected to drop to a 13-year low of U.S.$2 billion, 
compared to U.S.$18.7 billion in 1987, the Board of Foreign 
Trade (BOFT) reported Friday [13 May]. 
  Taiwan's trade surplus continued to fall in the first four 
months of this year, even after the island recorded its lowest 
trade surplus in nine years in 1993, BOFT Deputy 
Director-General Lin Yi-fu said. 
  If the trend persists, he said, Taiwan is doomed to become 
an 
import-oriented country rather than an export-oriented one. 
  Lin said the development may serve as an important early 
warning signal for Taiwan, an economy heavily dependent on 
manufacturing industries and exports. 
  As exports are becoming less vital, domestic demand will 
become the prime mover behind the country's economic growth in 
the future, Lin maintained. 
  Lin hoped that Taiwan would follow in the footsteps of 
Singapore in keeping a surplus in its international balance of 
payments despite running a deficit in foreign trade. 
  Singapore has witnessed deficits in foreign trade during the 
last five years. It, however, maintained a comfortable 
international balance of payments surplus of U.S.$3 billion in 
1992, with its two-way trade deficit exceeding U.S.$8.7 billion, 
Lin said. 
  Meanwhile, Lin hoped that Taiwan would not turn out to be 
the 
second South Korea, which was ousted from the informal "Asian's 
four little dragons" grouping last year because of its 
relatively poor economic performance. 
  South Korea has suffered a continued decline in exports 
during the last few years due to sluggish industrial 
development. Its economy failed to pick up because other 
domestic industries, including the service industry, didn't rise 
to fill the vacancies left by departing manufacturing 
industries, Lin said. 
  According to customs tallies, Taiwan exported U.S.$27.58 
billion worth of goods and services in the January-April period 
of this year, up 2.3 percent over the similar period last year, 
with metal, electrical machinery, and textile products 
dominating the export list. 
  Imports during the four-month period totaled U.S.$26.98 
billion, up 7.2 percent over a year-earlier, with capital 
equipment, industrial and farm raw materials, metals, and 
chemicals leading the trade. 
  During the four months, exports to the United States, Japan 
and Europe all declined while Taiwan's deficit with Japan 
increased, Lin said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- Acting to respond to the 
government's efforts to correct the nation's chronic towering 
trade deficit with Japan, business figures on Monday [16 May] 
echoed and endorsed a government plan to set up a privately 
owned holding company. 
  At a meeting with Board of Foreign Trade officials and 
private sector representatives Monday, Kao Ching-yuan, chairman 
of the Chinese National Federation of Industries, gave his 
backing to the proposed company, and suggested that the 
government finance the company's research and development 
projects after its establishment. 
  A follow-up meeting scheduled for June 9 by the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs is set to make further plans regarding the 
company's proposed opening date and what products it will make 
in trying to replace Japanese imports, the board said. 
  The board said the holding company would first begin 
producing key parts and components that are imported from Japan 
to the tune of US$50 million each on a yearly basis. 
  Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$4.96 billion in the 
first 
four months of the year, up 4.5 percent from the same period 
last year. But its deficit with Japan was US$14.22 billion last 
year, and the figure is expected to hit US$15.5 billion this 
year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang has 
decided to join hands with South Korean companies in buying 
banks in Indonesia in line with the government's "southern 
strategy," Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the KMT [Kuomintang] 
Business Management Committee, said Saturday [14 May]. 
  "We will seek to buy existing banks run by Chinese in 
Indonesia and establish leasing companies to provide financial 
support for the Taiwan businesses there," Liu said. 
  Taiwan-invested businesses in Indonesia mostly rely on 
foreign banks and the Jakarta office of the China Trust 
Commercial Bank for loans. 
  Liu, during his visit to Jakarta in April, approached 
several 
leading conglomerates with the plan and reached a preliminary 
agreement with a South Korean bank in May. 
  Liu also said that in addition to Indonesia, the KMT is also 
planning to buy a bank in Hong Kong before the colony's transfer 
to Mainland China in 1997. 
  He said that the plan to run banks and other financial 
businesses is only part of the party's "all-out" overseas 
investment policy. Manufacturing and trading industries, he 
added, will follow.

  [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Liu Tai-ying, president of 
the Kuomintang [KMT] Business Management Committee, said Friday 
[13 May] that KMT-run enterprises will strengthen cooperation 
with South Korea, Japan, Russia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. 
  Liu, a renowned economist, made the statement upon his 
return 
from a week-long visit to South Korea and Japan. He said 
KMT-owned firms have made plans to work together with South 
Korea's financial sector to open banks and leasing companies in 
Indonesia in line with the government's "southern strategy," 
which encourages Taiwan investors to increase investments in 
Southeast Asia. 
  He said he had visited the Mitsubishi Co. and the Mitsui Co. 
in Japan to seek bilateral cooperation in shipping, energy, 
transportation, tourism, and trade. 
  The ruling party is also considering investing in Russia's 
salmon, cement, and forestry industries, Liu said. Russian made 
goods could be shipped to Hong Kong for resale to Indonesia and 
Vietnam, while Taiwan's electronics products and Indonesia's 
petrochemical goods could be exported to Russia, he elaborated. 
  To help promote the "southern strategy," he said, senior 
executives of KMT-run enterprises will make a trip to Jakarta 
and Surabaya in Indonesia next month to talk with their 
Indonesian counterparts on cooperative ties. 
  Liu said that he will visit Indonesia again in July to make 
a 
final decision on the investment plans. He first visited the 
Southeast Asian country in early April. 
  The KMT-owned companies are also planning to make inspection 
tours of Myanmar [Burma], North Korea, and Palau this year as 
part of their efforts to explore new outlets, he added.

  [Text] Speaking yesterday [7 May] at a seminar on 
mainland-related economic and trade policy and cross-strait 
transportation sponsored by the [words indistinct] Junior 
Chamber in Taichung City, Huang Kun-hui, chairman of the 
Mainland Affairs Council under the Executive Yuan, said: As 
part of our plans to build Taiwan into a business center in the 
Asia-Pacific region, we do not exclude the possibility of 
establishing direct transportation links with Mainland China. 
However, we should not end up turning Shanghai into a business 
center following the establishment of such links. Now is not 
the time to foster wide-ranging transportation links. 
  Huang Kun-hui said: Direct cross-strait transportation can 
indeed reduce the cost and time of shipping containers. 
However, since our country and Communist China are in a state 
of hostility, the unconditional establishment of such links will 
amount to an acknowledgement that any direct routes thus 
established are domestic routes in Communist China. This will 
make it difficult to clarify to other nations that our country 
is not a province of China. Also, direct transportation 
services will affect our country's alert status.

  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan's first civilian 
anti-narcotics group was established in Taipei Saturday [14 May] 
with Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou witnessing the kick-off 
ceremony. 
  At the ceremony inaugurating the Republic of China [ROC] 
Anti-Drug Promotion Group, Ma said that the work against 
narcotics should be deeply rooted in people's minds, and that it 
depends on both government and civilian efforts. 
  He said the anti-drug movement must be jointly pushed by 
both 
government and people, since the moet powerful weapons against 
illegal drugs are in the hands of citizens themselves. 
  Executive director of the newly-established group Liu 
Chang-luen said he and group members will take concrete actions 
over a long period of time in line with Premier Lien Chan's 
policy of combining government and civilian efforts in a war 
against drugs. 
  Those attending the inauguration ceremony at the Taipei 
international convention center included Vice Justice Minister 
Lin Hsi-hu, Legislator Rau Ying-chi, and National Assemblyman 
Tsai Chung-chi.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 13 (CNA) -- The relatives of the 
Taiwan victims killed in the March 31 Qiandao Lake disaster 
Friday [13 May] expressed their dissatisfaction with Mainland 
China's investigation of the incident. 
  The relatives, who on Thursday ended their visit to Qiandao 
Lake with a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) delegation led by 
deputy secretary-general Hsu Hui-you, said in a joint statement 
that the trip "hasn't increased their understanding of the 
truth" behind the tragedy, in which 24 Taiwan tourists and eight 
mainland crew and guides were burned to death in the lower deck 
cabin of the tour boat they had been cruising on. 
  "On the contrary, it did increase our doubts of the result 
of 
investigation," they said. 
  Four mainlanders were arrested for robbing and murdering the 
tourists. The incident provoked a storm of protest in Taiwan 
and led to a boycott organized by local travel agents of tour 
groups to the mainland. 
  The SEF delegation, which also included criminal 
investigators, visited Qiandao Lake and were able to inspect the 
boat on which the victims perished. In a meeting with mainland 
police Friday morning in Hanzhou, however, the group raised 50 
questions pertaining to the incident, all of which went 
unanswered. 
  Taiwan has accused the mainland of attempting to cover up 
the 
incident, and has demanded that it clear up remaining questions, 
such as the kind and number of weapons used by the killers, the 
time of the killing, and whether mainland police set fire to the 
boat a second time to destroy evidence of the crime. 
  Meanwhile in Taipei, vice chairman Kao Koong-lien of the 
Mainland Affairs Council said that the SEF delegation will 
publish the results of its investigative trip prior to its 
departure for home Saturday. 
  He called on local travel agents to continue the tour group 
boycott until mainland authorities make known all the facts of 
the case.

  [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan will work with 
Southeast Asian countries to increase regional intellectual 
property rights (IPR) protection, the Board of Foreign Trade 
(BOFT) said Friday [13 May]. 
  Taiwan is paying equal attention to consultations on both 
IPR 
protection and agricultural imports as part of its effort to 
join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), BOFT 
officials said. 
  The efforts include exchanges of information and personnel 
between Taiwan and members of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN). 
  Besides IPR protection consultations, the officials said, 
BOFT is seeking bilateral recognition of national laboratories 
and cooperation in product verification and quality control 
certification with ASEAN members. 
  Details of the issues will be further discussed in an 
October 
Asia-Pacific meterology conference to be held in Taipei, BOFT 
said.

Philippines' Subic Bay May 24-26 to inspect potential investment 
sites, a federation official said Thursday [19 May]. 
  Vice Secretary-General Chen Chin-nan said the group members 
will seek to understand labor problems there and consult with 
Philippine authorities on the business tax they will collect 
from Taiwan investors. 
  Chen said as the Philippines has frequent labor disputes and 
strikes, Taiwan investors are concerned about whether there will 
be similar incidents when they set up business there. 
  Investment in Subic Bay is one part of the government's 
"southern strategy," which encourages Taiwan investment in 
Southeast Asia.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 18 (CNS) -- Member of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC) and Hong Kong Affairs Adviser, Mr. Yu 
Kwok-chun, speaking in an interview with the Hong Kong China 
News Agency, expressed that early preparations for the issuance 
of passports of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region 
(SAR) and consultation with foreign countries on mutual 
exemption of visas was an important matter for the smooth 
transition of Hong Kong, adding that if the British Hong Kong 
government was sincere to maintain the prosperity and stability 
in the territory, it should engage in active coordination to the 
issuing of such passports. 
  Mr. Yu said that it was very necessary for the Preliminary 
Committee [as received] for the Preparatory Committee of the SAR 
as well as its security affairs group to discuss at present the 
preparatory work on the issuance of the SAR passports, since 
there were only more than three years to come from now on to the 
hand-over of sovereignty right of Hong Kong in 1997. In this 
period, the preliminary work on this matter should be carried 
out. In addition, such passports should be publicized and 
popularized overseas in order to make them acceptable in more 
countries and passports issued by foreign countries would be, in 
return, recognized in Hong Kong. 
  Mr. Yu pointed out that the issuance in advance of SAR's 
passports to those China's citizens who were holding permanent 
residential identity cards certainly required the British Hong 
Kong Government to provide related materials of passport 
applicants, the issuance of this kind of passports must be 
responsible both for Hong Kong people and those countries by 
which these passports were accepted therefore they could not be 
issued in an irresponsible way. 
  The adviser held that should the work of the passport 
issuance be done after 1997, the two kinds of passports would 
not dovetail, creating inconveniences for Hong Kong residents in 
their travels and businesses overseas as well as unfavorable 
influence to the territory.

  [Text] The internationally-acclaimed director Zhang 
Yimou's banned movie Huozhuo should not be shown in Hong Kong 
unless local distributors obtain clearance from the Chinese 
authorities, a local Chinese official warned yesterday. 
  Speaking at a function to promote next year's film festival 
in Shanghai, Cui Songming, the deputy head of the cultural and 
sports department of the Xinhua (New China News Agency) office 
in Hong Kong, said approval from China's Ministry of Radio, Film 
and Television was needed before the movie could be shown. 
  "There was always a clear requirement in China that any 
movies, including those whose post-production was done in the 
mainland, should be censored by the Ministry of Radio, Film and 
Television." 
  He said Hong Kong movie-makers should respect China's system 
and follow the procedures when they went to the mainland to make 
movies as a realisation of the "one country, two systems" 
principle. 
  "If the related parties decide to film the movie (without 
passing the censorship in China) arbitrarily, it will no doubt 
cause disturbances between two places," he said. 
  The deputy head also used the movie, Farewell, My Concubine, 
as an example of how local producers had taken advantage of the 
"confusion" in China and screened the movie in Hong Kong without 
Beijing's approval. 
  When asked about director Zhang's absence from the Cannes 
film festival as a protest against the censorship of his film, 
Mr Cui said: "You may say the Government is tightening its 
policy on film. But, I think, it's necessary to rectify the 
discipline in the cultural industry. 
  "It's usual for a country to have some internal regulations. 
I don't think the move will discourage film-makers from coming 
to China." 
  He said artists should not feel concerned by the controls. 
Mr Cui said each movie's script should be censored before the 
actual production began, and artists would not run into any 
problems if directors followed the censored copy. 
  Huozhou, a top contender at the Cannes film festival, tells 
the story of three generations of a family living through the 
China of the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including the Great Leap 
Forward and the Cultural Revolution. 
  Sources said although the film itself carried no political 
message, the authorities were not happy with its depiction of 
the various political campaigns in China. 
  A local artist who has expressed an interest in the local 
distribution of Huozhuo said yesterday a copy of the movie would 
be submitted to local censors and he hoped permission to screen 
the movie would soon be obtained. 
  But the artist did not want to comment on the Xinhua 
official's statement, saying the whole process was at a 
"preliminary stage". 
  Speaking at the same promotion yesterday, mainland director 
Xie Jin said the recent tightening of China's art policy had had 
little effect on his works. 
  The president of the Shanghai School of Performance said it 
was normal practice for a mainland production to apply for a 
censor visa from the Government. 
  "I don't think the procedures will affect film-makers' 
creativity."
