<F P=106> ["New Analysis" by Wang Nan: "Why Is MFN a Misnomer?"] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 18 (XINHUA) -- The most favored 
nation (MFN) trade status, widely interpreted as a privilege 
offered by Washington to almost all of its trading partners, is 
really a misnomer. 
  In a fundamental sense, observers here said, MFN has become 
the minimum requirement of meaningful economic exchanges between 
two countries and cannot be used by the U.S. to exercise 
leverage in foreign policy. 
  "MFN status is not a concession or foreign aid, but merely 
the normal basis for international trade," said Robert Manning, 
senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute and researcher 
at George Washington University. 
  As President Bill Clinton is nearing his decision on China's 
MFN status, the relatively technical term has become a matter of 
intense debate which, observers said, should be put in the 
proper context. 
  The articles of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) 
contains a MFN clause that applies to all members' tariffs and 
all other rules relating to imports and exports, which form the 
keystone effort to liberalize trade. 
  Washington has two basic sets of tariff rates, with the 
lower 
tariff rate, referred to as MFN, applicable to most countries, 
including those to which the U.S. has serious policy differences. 
  The non-MFN tariff rates, promulgated in the 1930 
Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act at the peak of U.S. protectionism, 
average over 40 percent and are believed to be instrumental in 
causing the then world depression. 
  MFN became an instrument for Washington to express its moral 
outrage in 1974, when President Richard Nixon, wanting to give 
the Soviet Union MFN, tried to use it to force Moscow to permit 
Jewish emigration. 
  With the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, MFN can be extended, and 
thus renewed annually, to non-market economies only when a 
special waiver is issued by the President saying that the 
country does not impede emigration. 
  In the case of China, not a GATT member but enjoying MFN 
status in the U.S. market since 1980, MFN expires on June 3 
every year. Congress, if objecting to MFN renewal, must come up 
with a joint resolution by September 1. 
  The President, then, has the option of vetoing the 
resolution, in which case Congress has 15 legislative days to 
override the veto only with two-thirds votes in both the Senate 
and the House of Representatives. 
  "Ironically, the original intention of the Jackson-Vanik 
Amendment has been forgotten," said Nicholas Lardy, professor at 
the University of Washington and author of numerous studies on 
China's economy. 
  On the basis of the original emigration criterion, Lardy 
noted, China qualifies for MFN status since Chinese emigration 
to the U.S. is restricted mainly by U.S. immigration policy 
rather than by Chinese policy. 
  New conditions to renew China's MFN were included in 
Clinton's presidential order in May 1993, although none of them 
was envisaged in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment as a criterion for 
extending MFN to non-market economies. 
  "In Christmas tree-like fashion," Robert Manning of the 
Progressive Policy Institute said, "Congress added conditions to 
MFN renewal as though it were stringing lights on a Christmas 
tree." 
  These conditions include U.S. concerns on trade, human 
rights 
and weapons proliferation. "On its own terms, MFN 
conditionality has not worked," Manning added. 
  In a recent statement, the National Manufacturers 
Association 
(NAM) described the America's unilateral imposition of 
restraints on bilateral trade relations to convey concerns about 
other policy as "historically ineffective". 
  MFN "is not an issue of us granting something to the 
Chinese," NAM's president Jerry Jasinowski explained. 
"Non-discriminatory or MFN treatment is the commercial 
equivalent of diplomatic recognition." 
  Even with MFN status, observers here noted, China is still 
disadvantaged in its trade with Washington as compared with most 
of the other developing countries which receive other tariff 
benefits. 
  These benefits include the Generalized System of Preferences 
(GSP), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) and the Andean Trade 
Preference Act (ATPA), which offer lower tariffs to as many as 
138 countries and regions in the world.

  [Text] Brazzaville, 15 May (XINHUA) -- Granting an 
interview to XINHUA on the eve of his departure for visit to 
China, Congolese President Pascal Lissouba said China is a real 
friend of Congo with very sincere friendship between the two 
countries. 
  President Lissouba will begin his week-long state visit to 
China on 19 May at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin -- 
his first visit to China. It has been learned that President 
Lissouba will exchange views with Chinese leaders on 
international and bilateral relations during his visit. He will 
also tour other parts of China to better understand conditions 
of its reform, opening up, and construction of a socialist 
market economy. 
  Lissouba is an old friend known to the Chinese people. China 
and Congo established diplomatic ties in 1964 when he was 
premier of Congo. 
  Touching on friendly cooperative relations between China and 
Congo in the past three decades, Lissouba praised such 
cooperation as a model, saying "This kind of cooperation is what 
Congo has been looking for." He maintained that China has been 
consistent in fulfilling its obligations and has done a lot for 
Congo. Lissouba said that he will express respect to the 
Chinese people and their leaders during his forthcoming visit 
and explore jointly with Chinese leaders new ways and means of 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  On Congo's current economic situation, Lissouba said that, 
due to poor management and inappropriate exploitation of state 
resources, Congo is currently heavily indebted with its economy 
on the brink of collapse. He said Congo, with its rich natural 
resources, would like to further strengthen cooperation of 
mutual benefit with China in better opening up and utilizing its 
resources, particularly in promoting agricultural production.

  [Text] Stockholm, 10 May (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, met with Swedish Foreign Trade Minister 
Dinkelspiel here this afternoon. The two firmly believe that 
there are broad prospects for mutually beneficial economic 
cooperation and trade between China and Sweden. 
  Li Ruihuan said: Sweden is up to the world's highest 
standards in the fields of transport, telecommunications, 
energy, and medicine. Over the last decade and more, many 
Swedish enterprises have actively entered the market in China, 
and a number of new Sino- Swedish joint ventures are being set 
up. "We welcome more Swedish enterprises to take an active part 
in competition in the Chinese market. We are glad to see that 
the Swedish Government takes a positive attitude toward the 
development of Sino-Swedish economic relations and trade." 
  Dinkelspiel said: At present, Swedish enterprises are 
greatly interested in the Chinese market and both their trade 
volume and investment in China are increasing. The Swedish 
Government is making efforts to promote the economic cooperation 
and trade between the two countries. He said that the Swedish 
Government supports the restoration of China's signatory status 
in the GATT because it helps promote global trade and conforms 
to the interests of the Swedish people.

<F P=106> [By GUANGMING RIBAO reporter Zhang Yufu (1728 7183 4395) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zhu Dongju (2612 0392 5468)] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 6 May (XINHUA) -- The 1994 national 
congress of China Vocational Education Service was held in 
Beijing today. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council, Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, attended 
the congress to offer congratulations and deliver a speech. 
  He said: Since its inception, China Vocational Education 
Service has devoted itself to researching and promoting 
vocational education, has set up various vocational schools, and 
has disseminated new ideas aimed at linking education with 
labor, such as those promoting "respect for labor," "manual 
skills," and the "application of both physical and mental 
power." This has helped nurture large numbers of specialized 
personnel who are knowledgeable and technically skilled. 
[passage omitted] 
  Li Lanqing noted: Educational development will determine 
whether we can build a socialist market economic system, and 
whether we can realize modernization; so will the improvement of 
national quality and the training of various specialized 
personnel. Our country is not an economically developed nation 
but it has to undertake the world's most extensive educational 
service; this is the reality of our education situation. By the 
end of this century, therefore, we should vigorously expand 
vocational education and train large numbers of people with 
practical skills needed for developing the socialist market 
economy, while basically universalizing the nine-year compulsory 
educational system, and basically eradicating illiteracy among 
youth. This provides the means by which we can achieve greater, 
faster, better, and more economical results in solving our 
country's educational problems; it can be described as a 
fundamental solution. The development of vocational education 
is a basic task of strategic importance for improving workers 
ideologically, morally, scientifically, and culturally, and for 
realizing socialist modernization; it is also of special 
importance to further consolidating the socialist system lead by 
the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. 
[passage omitted] 
  Attending today's opening ceremonies were Ni Zhifu, vice 
chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee; 
Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme and Wan Guoquan, vice chairmen of the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference; and responsible persons from various 
democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and 
Commerce, and relevant departments.

<F P=106> [By reporter 2806 0202 1627: "At the National Meeting of </F>
Directors of Posts and Telecommunications Administration 
Bureaus, Zou Jiahua Calls for Seizing the Opportunity To 
Accelerate the Development of Communications"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- A few days ago, at the 
closing ceremony of the national meeting of directors of posts 
and telecommunications administration bureaus, Zou Jiahua, vice 
premier of the State Council, pointed out: Postal and 
telecommunications departments should seize the current 
opportunity to improve service and accelerate the development of 
communications, on the basis of implementing the principles of 
making overall planning, combining departments with localities, 
letting each level assume responsibility for itself, and joining 
efforts to build communications facilities. 
  Zou Jiahua said: The development of transportation and 
communications directly promotes the circulation of commodities 
and the development of the socialist market economy of our 
country. At present, the international environment is conducive 
to China, and China itself also has the conditions to develop 
communications. In addition, the society's demands for 
communications facilities are becoming greater day by day. 
Thus, China's posts and telecommunications are precisely in a 
very good period of development. Last year, thanks to the 
concerted efforts of staff, workers, and cadres of postal and 
telecommunications departments, the completed investment in 
fixed assets amounted to 40 billion yuan, the newly added 
capacity of telephone exchanges for the use of telephone offices 
reached 12.86 million lines, and 8 optical fiber cables were 
made available. Such a situation is rare in the world 
communications history, and this is a very great achievement. 
  In the light of the principles of making overall planning, 
combining departments with localities, letting each level assume 
responsibility for itself, and joining efforts to build 
communications facilities, Zou Jiahua explained: By overall 
planning, we mean that postal and communications departments 
should strengthen the macro-management of the national 
communications trades and strive to change from the past method 
of laying undue emphasis on the micro-management of postal and 
telecommunications departments to laying emphasis on the 
macro-management of the communications facilities throughout the 
country. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications should 
conscientiously formulate the strategic principle for China's 
communications development and draw up the long-term plan and 
the fiscal-year plan for the national telecommunications 
development. In the field of combining departments with 
localities, he pointed out: The idea of cooperation and 
coordination should be fostered, and the scientific research 
forces and production forces of various departments, provinces, 
and municipalities should be pooled together to build 
communications facilities. On no account should we engage in 
overlapping construction. Not only should we successfully build 
the public communications network throughout the country but 
also should we give full play to the role of special networks. 
At the same time, we should give full play to the initiative of 
all localities and departments. 
  He also said: To accelerate the development of posts and 
telecommunications, we should depend on scientific and 
technological progress. Over the past few years, postal and 
telecommunications departments have taken a big step in applying 
new technologies. They have applied many communications 
technologies that are advanced in the world, such as 
program-controlled exchanges, optical fiber cable 
communications, satellite communications, and mobile 
communications. Postal and telecommunications departments 
should cooperate with other pertinent departments to form an 
overall advantage of research and development. 
  He pointed out: In the course of developing posts and 
telecommunications, we should all the more attend to service 
work. The demands of consumers should become the motivation to 
improve our work. Posts and telecommunications should not be 
turned to a kind of power. The idea of serving the people and 
serving the national economy should be fostered.

  [Text] Beijing, May 18 (XINHUA) -- China today set up the 
Zhonggu Cereals and Oils Group and the Zhongshang Enterprise 
Group. 
  Both are claimed to be the biggest in the country in the 
cereals trade and commercial businesses. 
  Addressing the inaugural meeting of the two groups, Minister 
of Internal Trade Zhang Haoruo said that the two state-owned 
groups will be the main forces in helping the central government 
exercise effective macro-control in the two trades. 
  He pointed out that the establishment of the two groups was 
of great importance to stabilize commodity prices, and to the 
smooth carrying out of the "vegetable basket" project and 
grain-supply project -- the two government plans to provide 
enough food for the people. 
  Zhang said that the Zhonggu Group will mainly conduct trade 
in cereals and edible oil. It has more than 100 subordinate 
enterprises. 
  The central enterprise of Zhonggu claimed a registered 
capital fund of 200 million Renminbi yuan. 
  Businesses conducted by the Zhongshang Commercial Enterprise 
Group will cover retail sale, wholesale and all other commodity 
distribution businesses. 
  It has 18 closely-related subordinate enterprises and 
hundreds of loosely-controlled enterprises. 
  The whole Zhongshang Group reported a total capital of more 
than two billion yuan, and the enterprise at the core has a 
registered capital of 150 million yuan.

  [Text] Beijing, May 18 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
has decided largely to solve the food problem in the next seven 
years for the 80 million rural residents now still living in 
poverty, according to the State Council. 
  In a state plan for poverty elimination, which is made 
public 
today, the State Council said that to attain that goal, it will 
concentrate China's manpower, materials and funds and mobilize 
all sectors of society. 
  "Although poor people constitute a small proportion of 
China's rural population, the task for eliminating poverty is 
extremely arduous," the plan said. 
  That is because these people are concentrated in areas with 
harsh natural conditions, such as high mountainous areas, desert 
areas, loess highlands and areas where much of the land has been 
taken for reservoirs, it explained. 
  The plan outlined the following points for solving the food 
problem for these 80 million people by the end of the century: 
  -- The overwhelming majority of poor households will score a 
big increase in per-capita earnings; 
  -- Poor households will be assisted in creating basic 
conditions for solving the food problem, such as cultivating 
stable and high- yield farmland, orchards and woods, expanding 
livestock breeding and sideline production; 
  -- The problem of insufficient drinking water will be solved 
by and large; 
  -- Most poor townships will be linked by highways and have 
electricity; 
  -- Primary education will be made universal and illiteracy 
among adults will be eliminated; 
  -- Vocational education and technical training will be 
promoted among adults; and 
  -- Endemic diseases will be prevented and brought under 
control. 
  The plan said that officials and farmers in poor areas will 
be encouraged to achieve prosperity by becoming market-oriented, 
relying on the use of science and techniques, developing local 
resources and expanding commodity production. 
  Rural residents living in areas with extremely harsh natural 
conditions will be relocated, it added. 
  According to the plan, the State Council has decided to 
increase appropriations for the poverty-elimination program from 
1994. 
  The plan mandated local governments at all levels to 
increase 
funding for the program. 
  It also emphasized the need to promote exchanges and 
cooperation with the international community in poverty 
elimination. 
  It is imperative to try to improve the investment 
environment 
in poor areas and encourage overseas investors to start 
productive enterprises to make full use of natural resources 
there, it noted. 
  The plan also banned the government of any poor county from 
buying cars, building luxury hotels or constructing office 
buildings before the food problem is solved among local 
residents.

<F P=106> [By China editor Cary Huang and Angel Lau] </F>
  [Text] Senior Guangdong officials have called for a 
clampdown on unauthorized fund-raising in an effort to toe the 
line on Beijing's recent reimposition of austerity measures. 
  The move called by Governor Zhu Shenlin and Executive 
Vice-Governor Lu Ruihua was aimed at rectifying the financial 
situation in the booming southern province after increasing 
pressure from the central authorities. 
  In a recent speech, Mr Zhu called on local governments 
across 
the province to launch an investigation into illegal 
fund-raising. 
  The governor also called for a renewed campaign to rectify 
the financial situation in a drive to cool down the overheating 
economy and support Beijing's effort to raise funds for the 
state coffers. 
  Sources said central departments, including the Finance 
Ministry, People's Bank of China, the central bank and the State 
Planning Commission, were upset by Guangdong's failure to 
fulfill the quota imposed by Beijing for treasury bond 
purchasing. 
  Mr Zhu blamed the rampant practices of illegal fund-raising 
by localities and businesses as chief reasons for the failure of 
state bond purchasing in the province. 
  The unauthorized raising of interest rates by local banks 
and 
financial institutes was also another factor that resulted in a 
sluggish market for state bonds, Mr Zhu said. 
  The governor called for a responsible system to be 
introduced 
for state bond issuing, which required local government heads to 
be personally liable for fulfilling their planned quotas. 
  Meanwhile Mr Lu, vice-governor in charge of overall 
economics, called for a renewed campaign to fight illegal 
activities in the financial and banking sector. 
  Mr Lu warned local government and banking officials to 
sincerely implement central policies or face charges if they 
were found to be seriously violating government regulations on 
banking and financial business. 
  The rectification policies, known as the austerity program, 
were initiated by Chinese economic czar Executive Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji last June but lifted at a later date. 
  However, Beijing has recently decided to reimpose the 
policies, which include measures to tighten credit, attain 
financial discipline and monetary order. 
  Guangdong, with the largest economy in China, has become the 
chief target of Beijing's clampdown. 
  Meanwhile, a Chinese news agency said Guangdong should keep 
investment in fixed assets to within a growth rate of 40 percent 
this year after rapid increases during the previous two years. 
  "Guangdong is not only the fastest growing place of the 
Chinese economy but also a huge investment province," the China 
News Service said yesterday. 
  However, two years of speedy development in fixed assets 
from 
1992 to 1993 had brought about a so-called "investment expansion 
disease" to the province whose investment in fixed assets 
generally accounted for one-tenth of China's total.

  [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
Thursday [19 May] urged mainland Chinese authorities to face the 
reality of China's division with new concepts and new strategies. 
  President Li made the call in his national affairs address 
to 
the National Assembly which is meeting on Yangmingshan in 
suburban Taipei to discuss sweeping constitutional reforms. 
  Li said Beijing's resistance to recognizing China's division 
into two separate parts has hindered the establishment of mutual 
trust between the two sides of the Taiwan strait, adding he 
hopes the mainland leadership will abandon its aggressive 
attitude toward Taiwan and take the initiative to promote 
peaceful competition between the two sides for the well-being of 
the Chinese people. 
  He continued that defending the security of Taiwan, Penghu, 
Kinmen and Matsu is now the top goal of the Republic of China 
[ROC]'s national defense policy. 
  "We are seeking to beef up our defense capabilities by 
purchasing advanced arms and enhancing combat preparedness while 
trimming redundant military personnel," he explained. 
  The ROC is also seeking to join as many international 
organizations as possible, the president noted. With the end of 
the Cold War, Li said, a new world order is taking shape. 
  "Representation in major world organizations would enable US 
to participate in discussions and formulation of new 
international regulations," he noted. 
  The ROC will continue to promote trade with its major 
trading 
partners, such as the United States, Japan and European 
countries, Li said. In addition, the ROC will strengthen 
economic cooperation with Southeast Asian nations as part of its 
efforts to help boost Asia-Pacific regional economic integration. 
  Li pointed out that the Republic of China has created in the 
Taiwan area a multi-party democratic system which has never 
existed in Chinese history. "We should not be complacent with 
our current achievements, but should strive even harder for 
continued national development," he noted. 
  Li said the government is determined to promote further 
economic and political reforms, foster a cultural renaissance 
and improve welfare services. 
  The president said all National Assembly members are welcome 
to present their opinions on constitutional reforms and national 
affairs. He promised to attend the assembly sessions for the 
next five days to hear their opinions and reply to their 
questions. 
  This is the first time for an ROC president to participate 
in 
the National Assembly national affairs discussions in their 
entirety. In the past, the president was present only on the 
first day of such sessions, with the secretary-general of the 
presidential office then attending the remaining sessions on the 
president's behalf. 
  During its current special three-month session, the National 
Assembly is expected to pass a package of amendments to the ROC 
constitution to lay a framework for further democratic reforms, 
including direct popular election of the country's president and 
vice president.

  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- A group of independence 
activists on Monday [16 May] vowed to push for the drafting of a 
new constitution, defying warnings by government officials and 
the ruling Kuomintang that doing so would add to the tension 
between Taiwan and Mainland China. 
  Legislator Huang Huang-hsiung of the Democratic Progressive 
Party [DPP], Taiwan's largest opposition party, told the press 
that "the committee of the Taiwanese Constitution movement" will 
hold its second meeting on June 24-25 to discuss the matter. 
  The committee, comprising the World United Formosans for 
Independence (WUFI) and some other independence organizations, 
also plans to carry advertisements in Taiwan's five newspapers 
on Tuesday asking for public submissions on a national anthem 
and flag for the "new republic." 
  An interior ministry official said the committee, created 
last year, has not registered with the government and is 
therefore an illegal civilian body. He said any action taken by 
the organization to promote secessionism would be against the 
law, but he did not elaborate. 
  Chien Han-sheng, chairman of the Kuomintang Taipei 
Committee, 
when asked to comment on the committee's efforts, said: "It 
will create confusion and tension across the Taiwan Strait." 
  Li Ying-yuan, WUFI secretary-general, rebuffed the criticism 
and said the committee will go ahead with its plan as scheduled 
regardless of the government's response.

  [Text] Seven days of talks on the disposal of military 
land ended fruitlessly yesterday, with China accusing Britain of 
a lack of cooperation. 
  The failure dashed hopes of a long-expected deal at the 
Joint 
Liaison Group session expected to be held early next month. 
  Emerging from yesterday's talks, Chinese team leader Chen 
Zuoer lamented that China's reasonable appeals for information 
had been unsuccessful. 
  He criticised the British side for holding back information 
China had been seeking for the past seven years, but did not 
specify what was wanted. 
  And he rejected "rumours" that China had made new demands on 
the handover of military sites. 
  China has reportedly asked for a slightly bigger naval basin 
and decided to hold back one of the 25 military sites it had 
promised to hand to the Hong Kong Government for development. 
  "This does not comply with the facts. The fact is that the 
talks on the handover of the military sites are still going on 
between the two governments, and this will continue," he said. 
  His British counterpart, Alan Paul, attributed the failure 
to 
the complicated nature of the issue. 
  "If it were not, we would not have been talking about it for 
seven years," he said. 
  "We have done our best over this time to reach an agreement. 
We have not been successful. We are obviously disappointed but 
not despondent because both sides will continue to strive for 
agreement." 
  It is understood the British side deemed the new Chinese 
demands to be unacceptable, both to them and to the Legislative 
Council which will have to approve funds to reprovisioning of 
military facilities for China. 
  Foreign Office spokesman Bill Dickson said he was not aware 
of Mr Chen's claims of secrecy: "The British side has gone to 
enormous lengths to provide the Chinese delegation with 
information." 
  He said he did not expect yesterday's outcome to have any 
impact on the Joint Liaison Group plenum. 
  In Beijing, a senior mainland official warned Britain not to 
repeat the mistakes of the political negotiations when it seeks 
co-operation on other issues. 
  "China still wants to have co-operation on other issues... 
(We) hope that the British side can show sincerity and not 
repeat what it has done over the political question," said the 
deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Chen 
Ziying. 
  "The difference between clever and stupid people is that the 
former will not repeat the same mistake. (We) hope that we are 
all clever people," he told a business delegation from Hong Kong. 
  Earlier, in the territory, a deputy director of XINHUA (the 
New China News Agency), Zhang Junsheng, accused Britain of 
leaking to the press its determination to push ahead with the 
airport financing arrangement outlined in the fourth package of 
proposals. 
  Mr Zhang said Britain should make its stance clear at the 
Airport Committee meeting set for this week. 
  "Any problems between China and Britain should be sorted out 
through the Airport Committee discussions. The fact that 
Britain announced the re-opening of the talks while at the same 
time unilaterally publicising its stance on the fourth proposal 
will have a detrimental effect," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today that concerned 
authorities in China are putting Wei Jingsheng under house 
surveillance [jian shi ju zhu 4148 6018 1446 0145] and the 
report that he is being indicted is groundless. 
  A reporter asked at today's news conference: It is said that 
Wei Jingsheng will not be re-indicted on treason charges. Will 
he be indicted on other charges? In reply Wu Jianmin made the 
above statement. 
  Another reporter asked: Most recently there have been 
reports that demonstrations and protests had occurred in Lhasa, 
and that some foreigners in Tibet had their passports 
confiscated or were expelled from Tibet. Will you please 
confirm these reports? 
  Wu Jianmin said: I have not heard of such incidents. There 
will not be any problems for foreigners in China as long as they 
obey Chinese law. 
  Wu said: We should be aware that some people are deeply 
prejudiced against China, always attack and spread talk against 
China, and start rumors to confuse people. They do these things 
with ulterior motives. In any case, these words do not merit 
our attention or trust.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (XINHUA) -- At the news conference 
held at the International Club this afternoon, Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Wu Jianmin issued a statement in connection with 
Taiwan's attempt to accept dual recognition by South Africa of 
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. He also answered reporters' 
questions. 
  Wu Jianmin said: On 17 May, Qian Fu [Chien Fu] claimed in 
Taiwan's Legislative Yuan that Taiwan was prepared to accept 
South Africa's dual recognition of the two sides across the 
Taiwan Strait. This is yet another plot of the Taiwan 
authorities aimed at creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one 
Taiwan" in disregard of the overall interests of the Chinese 
nation. 
  He said: There is only one China in the world. The 
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal 
government representing the whole of China. Taiwan is an 
inalienable part of Chinese territory. This is a fact 
universally recognized by the United Nations and the 
international community at large. It is precisely on this basis 
that China has established diplomatic relations with 158 
countries in the world. 
  He pointed out: It is futile for the Taiwan authorities to 
try to end Taiwan's isolation in the world by way of "dual 
recognition." The only right choice is for them to go along with 
historical tide by helping bring about national reunification at 
an early date. 
  Wu Jianmin said: The Chinese Government appreciates the 
position of South African President Mandela and the African 
National Congress to pursue a one-China policy and their pledge 
to [Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1552 GMT on 19 
May transmits a correction changing "their pledge to" to "will"] 
address their relations with China in accordance with the 
practice of the United Nations and other international 
organizations. We believe that relations between China and the 
new South Africa will develop in an all-round way on the basis 
of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. 
  Following are Wu Jianmin's answers to reporters' questions: 
  A reporter asked: According to a report, the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development is ready to strengthen 
its relations with China. What is China's attitude toward the 
organization? Is China willing to join the organization? 
  The spokesman answered: We have taken note of the relevant 
report. We are maintaining good cooperative relations with many 
members of the organization, and we are also ready to join the 
organization in exploring ways to expand cooperative relations. 
We believe developing cooperative relations on the basis of 
equality and mutual benefit is beneficial to both sides. 
  Question [Q]: King Sihanouk has once again proposed a round 
table meeting in Pyongyang, and invited Chea Sim, Ranariddh, Hun 
Sen, and Khieu Samphan to attend the proposed meeting. What is 
your comment on this? 
  Answer [A]: We highly appreciate and support King Sihanouk's 
efforts in realizing national reconciliation and maintaining 
peace and stability in Cambodia. We sincerely hope that setting 
store by their national interests, the Cambodian leaders of 
various parties will, with the spirit of mutual understanding 
and mutual accommodation, make joint efforts for national 
reconciliation. 
  Q: According to a report, on 18 May U.S. Congressman Smith 
and others asserted that China is continuing to export prison 
labor products to the United States. What is your comment on 
this? 
  A: This is sheer fabrication. Regarding the export of 
prison labor products, China and the U.S. have signed a 
memorandum of understanding on prohibiting import and export 
trade in prison labor products. China has acted in strict 
compliance with the memorandum. Not long ago, China and the 
United States also signed a statement on cooperation for the 
implementation of the memorandum. Both the Chinese and U.S. 
sides share the view that the two documents are being 
implemented smoothly. Ulterior motives motivate some people to 
spread lies and vicious slander on this issue. 
  Q: A meeting of the Sino-British Hong Kong Airport Committee 
will be held on 20 May in Hong Kong. What are the Chinese 
side's expectations for this meeting? Is there a hope for the 
two sides to reach an agreement on financial arrangements for 
the new airport? 
  A: The Sino-British Airport Committee will hold a meeting in 
Hong Kong on 20 May. The Chinese side, as always, in accordance 
with the memorandum of understanding on the new airport, will 
make continuous efforts so that the two sides can reach an 
agreement on financial arrangements for the new airport at an 
early date.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin revealed today that the 
Red Cross Society of China had held two rounds of expert talks 
with the International Red Cross and the two sides agreed that 
the talks had furthered understanding and were very positive. 
  At today's press conference, Wu Jianmin said in reply to a 
question about exchanges between China and the International Red 
Cross: The second round of talks was held on 18 April, when a 
delegation of the International Red Cross was visiting China. 
Talks between the Red Cross experts and their Chinese 
counterparts on issues of interest to both sides were friendly, 
frank, and positive. 
  A reporter asked: There are reports that the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] would like to 
strengthen ties with China. What is China's attitude toward the 
organization? Does China want to join it? 
  Wu Jianmin said: We maintain good relations and cooperation 
with many OECD member states and would like to probe with OECD 
ways to develop ties and cooperation. We believe that 
developing cooperation on an equal footing and mutual interests 
benefits both sides.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- As the 
most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status is the foundation of 
normal trade between China and the United States, Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today, we hope that 
the United States will make a sensible decision. 
  At the press conference held today, a reporter asked: U.S. 
Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown recently said that there is 
full hope for extension of China's MFN. What is your comment on 
this? 
  Wu Jianmin replied: We have taken note of the remarks made 
by a number of American personages recently, calling for 
unconditional renewal of China's MFN. This is a positive 
development. 
  Another reporter asked: Will China make further concessions 
so that President Clinton can extend China's MFN status? 
  Wu Jianmin said that the differences between China and the 
United States can be discussed through dialogue on equal 
footing. If an agreement cannot be reached for the time being, 
we can seek common ground while reserving differences. The U.S. 
can only do what is permitted by its laws. China can only do 
what is permitted by China's laws. 
  A reporter asked: According to a report, a number of U.S. 
House of Representatives members, including Smith, said on 18 
May that China has not ceased exporting its prison goods to the 
United States. Do you have any comments on this? 
  Wu replied that the report is a sheer fabrication. On the 
question of prison goods export, China and the United States had 
already signed the "Memorandum of Understanding on Prohibiting 
the Exports and Trading of Prison Products." China strictly 
follows the memorandum. Not long ago, the two countries again 
signed a statement on cooperation in specific implementation. 
Both sides hold that implementation of the two documents is 
proceeding quite well. With ulterior motives, some people are 
spreading rumors on the issue in an attempt to throw mud at 
China.

<F P=106> ["Dispatch" on interview with Hou Zhitong by staff reporter </F>
He Hongze (0149 3136 3419) and China Radio International 
reporter Liu Hui (0491 2547) at the United Nations in New York; 
date not given: "Arduous Tasks for Disarmament and Arms 
Control--Interviewing Envoy Lou Zhitong, Chinese Disarmament 
Expert"] 
  [Text] Envoy Hou Zetong is China's well-qualified expert 
on disarmament. For many year he has constantly participated in 
UN negotiations and discussions on disarmament issues. After 
attending a session of the UN Disarmament Commission, which was 
held not long ago, he gave these reporters an interview. 
  He maintained: With the end of the Cold War, great changes 
have indeed taken place in the international situation. The 
bipolar pattern has been smashed and the confrontation between 
the two military blocs has disappeared. Nevertheless, the 
military might of those countries is still around. In 
particular, the United States and Russia still possess huge 
nuclear and conventional arsenals. The nuclear threat has not 
yet been eliminated. Moreover, at present, regional conflicts 
keep emerging. The world, including Europe, is far from being 
tranquil. In this sense, the issue of disarmament and arms 
control remains as it was before and the task of disarmament and 
arms control is still very arduous. 
  Envoy Hou pointed out: The main difference in disarmament at 
present lies in the focal point of nuclear disarmament. Some 
Western nuclear powers contend that great progress has been made 
in nuclear disarmament. The current focal point should be on 
the prevention of nuclear proliferation. However, many 
nonnuclear countries hold that although progress has been made 
in nuclear disarmament, there is still a long way to go in this 
regard. Further nuclear disarmament is still a current task of 
top priority. If this problem is not solved, it will be 
difficult to extend the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
indefinitely. 
  Attending the session with a positive and responsible 
approach toward the issue, the Chinese delegation 
comprehensively expounded the Chinese Government's principled 
stand on disarmament and put forth a document on weapons 
transfers and a proposal not to be the first to use nuclear 
weapons, to which various countries in the world have attached 
importance. When discussing this issue, Envoy Hou stressed the 
current practical significance of the proposal not to be the 
first to use nuclear weapons. He said: Since the emergence of 
nuclear weapons, the world has always been under the shadow of 
the threat from nuclear arms. Hence, there is the question of 
upholding or opposing the use of nuclear weapons. By upholding 
a policy of nuclear deterrence, Western countries argue that 
nuclear weapons can be used if necessary. China and many other 
countries hold a view opposed to this argument. When it 
conducted its first nuclear test in 1964, China unilaterally 
declared the commitment not to be first to use nuclear weapons 
and not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries. 
Now that the Cold War has come to an end, all the parties 
concerned are considering establishing a new international 
order. Some progress has been made in nuclear disarmament. The 
time is ripe for the five nuclear powers to sign a treaty 
committing themselves to no first use of nuclear weapons. 
Moreover, it is also relatively easy for them to reach an 
agreement. This proposal has been well received by the 
international community. It received a positive response from 
Russia. In March this year, the Chinese Government officially 
invited the other four nuclear powers to come to Beijing to hold 
talks on the issue. However, some nuclear powers lack a 
positive approach toward the invitation. 
  Envoy Hou also briefed these reporters on the issue of a 
complete prohibition of nuclear tests. Although the current 
session did not touch the issue, the Geneva disarmament 
conference was carrying out tense negotiations on it. 
Prohibiting nuclear tests is a universal demand of the 
international community. However, in the last few decades, no 
treaty on a complete prohibition of tests has been concluded. 
China's stand is that the complete prohibition and thorough 
destruction of nuclear weapons should be achieved as soon as 
possible. Prior to this, some partial measures can be taken. 
It is relatively difficult to conclude a treaty with which all 
the parties concerned are satisfied and which can be subject to 
international nuclear checks and to achieve a complete 
prohibition of tests. In spite of this, we support holding 
negotiations, and, together with other countries, we will strive 
for the conclusion of a treaty no latter than 1996. At the same 
time, we hold that in any treaty, the scope of the test ban and 
relevant definitions should be clear and definite so that no 
party will have their own interpretations of them and that the 
treaty will be free of loopholes and will not be turned into 
another treaty like that of 1963. This requires great efforts 
from all countries. 
  Based on his experience in attending negotiations on the 
disarmament issue over the years, Envoy Hou maintained: 
Compared with previous ones, the current disarmament 
discussions and negotiations are more practical, but they are 
also more difficult as they are entwined with regional issues. 
Nevertheless, disarmament is the common wish of the people of 
the world. The work of the UN Disarmament Commission should be 
strengthened rather than scrapped. It will play a more important 
role in world peace and security.

Current Events"] 
  [Text] New Proposal To Resolve B-H Crisis 
  After several hours of discussion on 13 May, foreign 
ministers of seven countries comprising the United States, 
Russia, and members of the European Union including France, 
Britain, Germany, Belgium, and Greece, eventually reached a 
unanimous agreement on putting forward a new proposal for 
resolving the crisis in B-H [Bosnia-Herzegovina]. 
  Judging from the contents, except for calling on the three 
conflicting factions to resume talks within two weeks and work 
hard to reach a cease-fire agreement for a period of four 
months, which are new, the present proposal basically reiterated 
the position on the issues of delimiting the boundaries in B-H, 
lifting sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
and so on, as contained in the original peace plan proposed by 
the European Union. However, the fact that the U.S. position 
has obviously moved closer to the European Union's plan is the 
largest progress that has been made. 
  As everybody knows, involvement of the big powers was a 
factor of the outbreak of conflict in B-H and the fact that 
peace efforts for the area have been repeatedly frustrated lies 
primarily in the diverse policies adopted by the big powers 
because of their different interest considerations. Now, the 
big powers have put forward a common plan after all. Even 
though it is still very difficult to put it into practice, 
people hope that it will be a good beginning for the political 
solution of the conflicts in B-H. 
<H5>  Sensible Voices </H5>
  In his speech in the U.S. Senate on 16 May, Senate Minority 
Leader, Republican Senator Dole said: "The President should 
immediately announce that he will unconditionally extend the 
most favored nation [MFN] status to China." He also stressed 
that the President "should frankly say what we, the great 
majority of people, have known for a long time: The practice of 
linking trade with human rights will not work. This policy has 
gone bust." Meanwhile, 106 congressmen signed a joint letter to 
Clinton on 17 May, urging him to extend the MFN status to China. 
  As 3 June draws near, the day on which U.S. President 
Clinton 
will make his decision on this issue, the intelligent voices 
from men of insight in the government and the public have become 
louder and louder. Strictly speaking, a nation's conditions and 
policies on human rights are its own internal affairs, while MFN 
treatment is a kind of specific term to facilitate trade 
exchanges between two sovereign states. In fact, there is no 
connection between these two things. 
  As disclosed by a U.S. newspaper, the findings of a survey 
conducted by the U.S. administration show that if the MFN status 
to China is revoked, it could cause losses of between $10 and 
$13 billion to China and the United States. It is no wonder 
that U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen repeatedly said that the 
MFN issue is of paramount importance to both China and the 
United States and that it must be handled prudently. 
<H5>  Where Does the Difficulty in the Syria-Israel Talks Lie? </H5>
  U.S. State Secretary Christopher was again on his shuttle 
tour of the Middle East from 15 to 18 May, the second time this 
month. After the talks on autonomy between the PLO and Israel 
had succeeded and a final agreement on implementing the autonomy 
was signed, the U.S. side wished very much to strike while the 
iron was hot and push the Middle East peace process further 
forward. But, the answer as to whether or not a new 
breakthrough can be made in the Arab-Israeli talks rests with 
Syria. Therefore, Christopher went to Syria a second time. 
Judging from the situation revealed by the various sides, 
however, though the talks have touched on substantive issues, it 
is not an easy job to actually resolve the problem. 
  In fact, compared with the Palestinian issue, the 
contradiction between Syria and Israel is much less complex and 
difficult. The crucial point lies in the fact that the hostile 
mentality caused by the confrontation between the two sides for 
many years is so intense that they cannot trust each other. 
Without mutual trust, it will be very difficult to achieve any 
results in the talks and to realize the goal of peaceful 
coexistence between the two sides.

  [Text] Seoul, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The United States Forces 
in Korea (USFK) started a three-day defense readiness drill 
involving USFK dependents and American civilians residing in 
South Korea Thursday [19 May], the Korea-U.S. Combined Forces 
Command (CFC) here said. 
  The semi-annual drill, which is called non-combatant 
evacuation operation (neo), will include the checking of 
manpower, paperwork and the operation to evacuate non-combatants 
in the event of war on the Korean peninsula, a CFC spokesman 
said. 
  "The drill is just part of the routine semi-annual program 
having nothing to do with the current situation in which tension 
has escalated due to the standoff involving Pyongyang's nuclear 
weapons program," the spokesman claimed. 
  At present, some 36,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South 
Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Five people of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), who had escaped 
from logging camps in Siberia, Russia, arrived here Wednesday 
[18 May] via a third country, the Foreign Ministry here said. 
  This is the first time for Seoul to allow the DPRK's loggers 
to resettle in South Korea through a lawful procedure, Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said. 
  "As they wanted to seek refuge in South Korea, the 
government 
decided to allow their resettlement here from a humanitarian 
point of view," Chang claimed. 
  He refused to disclose detailed information about how the 
loggers could flee and reach Seoul, saying he had to put into 
consideration the position of countries concerned and the 
personal safety of related people. 
  The South Korean Government decided on April 15 that it will 
accept all DPRK's escapees who wish to settle in South Korea. 
  However, the DPRK has accused South Korea of stepping up 
efforts to "kidnap" its loggers working in Siberia. 
  If the South Koreans "persist in their operation to kidnap 
our dignified workers by misrepresenting facts, in defiance of 
our reasonable warning, they will drink a bitter cup," said a 
statement released by the DPRK's Foreign Ministry earlier. 
  The DPRK has thousands of workers in logging camps in 
Siberia, getting paid by Russia in wood in return for providing 
the labor. 
  An estimated 500 loggers are said to have escaped from the 
camps, some of whom are hiding in various parts of Russia and 
seeking refuge in South Korea, according to reports. 
  The logging contract between Russia and the DPRK was to 
expire at the end of last year but the two sides are still 
negotiating its extension as Moscow demanded human rights 
condition improvement inside the camps. 
  The loggers who came to South Korea will get vocational 
training at a vocational education organization for a period, 
while receiving some amount of money for their resettlement, 
according to official sources.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today urged Japan to 
immediately stop its attempt at developing nuclear armaments and 
declare the total amount of plutonium in its possession. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted by the official KOREAN 
CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) today, said that the recent discovery 
of 70 kilograms of plutonium -- enough to make nine nuclear 
bombs -- at the nuclear fuel-making plant in Tokaimura, Japan is 
a "breach of the publicly recognized international law which 
must be dealt with seriously and condemned." 
  He said this shows Japan's "much-touted 'three non-nuclear 
principles' are merely a 'screen' for stepping up its nuclear 
armament to a full scale. 
  He criticized the noise Japan has made over the so-called 
nuclear issue of the DPRK saying it was a petty trick to conceal 
its own nuclear program and divert the public attention 
elsewhere. 
  "Japan has been engaged in nuclear development over the past 
decades and the amount of plutonium it has held in hiding is by 
no means less than what has been discovered," said the spokesman. 
  He asked the secretariat of the International Atomic and 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to give much attention to the question and 
take necessary measures accordingly. 
  "We consider the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
virtually meaningless since Japan's nuclear armament being 
promoted on the danger line has been verified in actuality," the 
spokesman noted. 
  He said the Korean Government calls upon the governments of 
all countries in the world, international organizations and 
anti-nuke groups to exert "unbiased efforts to remove the danger 
of nuclear development."

  [Text] Moscow, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Russia's government 
officials today reacted positively to NATO's decision to give 
Moscow a "special partnership". 
  Anatoliy Krasikov, President Boris Yeltsin's deputy 
spokesman, said the Russian Government welcomed the "fact that 
Russia's particular features will be taken into account." 
  NATO ambassadors agreed in principle on Wednesday [18 May] 
to 
offer Russia a special relationship, which would reflect its big 
power status. 
  The relationship will be somewhat different from the 
"Partnership for Peace" program, a new form of military 
cooperation between the 16-nation NATO and former Warsaw Pact 
countries. 
  Russia had refused to sign the Partnership for Peace after 
NATO air forces attacked Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
last month. 
  Krasikov hailed NATO's decision Wednesday "a right step," 
arguing that Moscow has never refused to join Partnership for 
Peace. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin said, 
"The reports coming from Brussels show the proposal is of great 
importance, and its tone sounds generally positive to us." 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) wants to build 
an informal relationship of intense contacts with Russia on 
issues like Bosnia, peacekeeping and nuclear arms without giving 
Moscow the right to consultation on security questions. 
  NATO's decision came one week before Russian Defense 
Minister 
Pavel Grachev is to visit NATO headquarters in Brussels next 
Tuesday to outline Russia's views on "Partnership for Peace." 
  Eighteen countries have so far signed the "Partnership for 
Peace," a program regarded by most of former Warsaw Pact nations 
as the first step towards full NATO membership.

  [Text] Brussels, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The 16-member NATO 
decided Wednesday [18 May] to offer Russia a "special 
partnership" to encourage the country to join its new military 
cooperation program for the former members of the Warsaw Pact. 
  The decision was made at a weekly meeting of the NATO 
ambassadors in Brussels, one week before Russian Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev visits the NATO headquarters. 
  Moscow has refused to join NATO's "Partnership for Peace" 
program if it was not given a special status. 
  Clearly NATO's offer will enable Moscow to have close 
consultations with NATO on security and other issues, though its 
outlines are still sketchy. 
  The relationship would be separate from the "Partnership for 
Peace", NATO sources said. However, he added that Moscow would 
certainly not be given a seat in NATO. 
  NATO offered the "special partnership" to Russia because 
Russia is a big and important country, the sources added. 
  In January, NATO outlined the "Partnership for Peace" 
program 
in order to draw former Warsaw Pact adversaries closer. 
  The plan was regarded by most of the former Warsaw Pact 
nations as the first step towards fully joining NATO. Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin has warned the alliance against moving 
its border eastward. 
  Observers notice that the NATO's decision was evidently 
planned prior to next week's visit of Russian Defense Minister 
Grachev. He is scheduled to address NATO ministers on Russia's 
views on "Partnership for Peace".

  [Text] Washington, May 19 (XINHUA) -- When defense 
ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) meet 
in Brussels next week, NATO's ties with Russia will be at the 
top of the agenda. 
  A senior U.S. Administration official, briefing reporters 
today on the background to the meeting, said the 16-member 
organization will judge whether Russian Defense Minister Pavel 
Grachev's tone is "conciliatory or confrontational" when he 
makes a presentation on Moscow's military doctrine. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry is planning a meeting 
with Grachev, the official said. 
  The official refuted press suggestions that NATO was 
offering 
a "special partnership" to Russia, but said the organization 
would recognize "Russia's strategic weight and interest in 
European affairs." 
  Russia had agreed to join NATO's "Partnership for Peace" 
earlier but postponed the move following NATO's threats to bomb 
the Bosnian Serbs. 
  The official said he was "hopeful" that Russia would still 
join, although Moscow may choose to have Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev sign the agreement later when he attends a North 
Atlantic Council meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, in early June. 
  Also attending next week's meeting will be officials from 
the 
18 countries that have already joined NATO's "Partnership for 
Peace." 
  Besides the partnership, NATO officials will also be 
discussing the Bosnian crisis and the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula, the official said.

  [Text] Washington, May 19 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao held talks 
at the White House today and both of them hoped a very close 
working relationship between the two countries. 
  Clinton said at a joint news conference after their meeting 
that "today we began what I hope will be a very close working 
relationship as our two countries forge a stronger partnership." 
  "Our nations share many common values," Clinton said, "We 
explored ways to deepen our ties and to expand cooperation." 
  The President supported India's ambitious program of 
economic 
reform, saying that "this important reform plan will be the 
engine of growth in our relationships." 
  The U.S. Commerce Department has identified India as one of 
the 10 biggest emerging markets around the world. 
  The United States is now India's largest trading partner, 
shipping a record of 2.8 billion dollars in goods and services 
to India last year and buying 4.6 billion dollars in Indian 
goods. 
  The Commerce Department estimates that U.S. exports to India 
could hit 5 billion dollars this year. 
  The United States is also the largest investor in India. Of 
the 4 billion dollars in new foreign investment approved by the 
Rao government since 1991, 1.7 billion dollars have come from 
the United States. 
  Indian Government officials have said that American firms 
invested more in India in 1993 than in the previous 45 years 
combined. 
  Clinton felt pleased at the rapid expansion of trade and 
investment between the two countries, adding that "we are proud 
of that and we want that relationship to grow." 
  Clinton acknowledged the two nations have some differences 
on 
human rights and nuclear non-proliferation. 
  "We pledged to intensify our efforts to achieve a 
comprehensive test ban treaty and a verifiable global ban on the 
production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons," he said. 
  Clinton also told Rao that he hoped that India and Pakistan 
would continue their constructive dialogue on ways to resolve 
their differences, including their differences over Kashmir. 
  Prime Minister Rao described his meeting with Clinton as 
"constructive, useful and candid as discussion between friends 
should be." 
  "We reviewed the tremendous economic opportunities thrown up 
by the sweeping economic reforms in India," Rao said at the 
joint news conference. 
  "The President and I agreed that we have an unprecedented 
opportunity to free India-U.S. bilateral relations from the 
distortions induced by the Cold War," Rao noted. 
  The two leaders also agreed to increase the frequency of 
high- level visits and exchanges between the two countries. 
  Clinton announced that he has asked Energy Secretary Hazel 
O'Leary to visit India in July to further their talks on 
renewable energy. 
  He will also send Commerce Secretary Ron Brown to India in 
November to promote further growth in trade and investment. 
  Rao has invited the President to visit India at the time of 
his convenience and Clinton has accepted it.

  [Text] Manila, May 20 (XINHUA) -- The Asian Development 
Bank (ADB) today approved a technical assistance grant of 
600,000 U.S. dollars to China for the Chang Jiang (Yangtze 
river) water and soil conservation and environment project. 
  The technical assistance will assist China in strengthening 
its capability to manage and develop the upper and middle 
reaches of the Chang Jiang basin in a economically viable and 
environmentally sustainable way, the Manila-based bank said. 
  With the assistance, seminars and workshops will be held for 
arousing greater awareness of environmental conservation among 
officials from the nine provinces included within the upper and 
middle reaches of the basin. 
  The technical assistance also will help reinforce linkages 
among government ministries to strengthen the concept of 
integrated basin management in order to achieve more effective 
flood control and to optimize efforts in economic development 
and environmental protection, said the ADB.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "China Resolutely Opposes Hegemony, Power </F>
Politics"] 
  [Text] The question of whether or not the United States 
will extend the most-favored-nation trade status to China is at 
a crucial moment at present. U.S. President Clinton sent a 
special envoy to China to exchange views with the Chinese side a 
few days ago. It is believed that this is helpful for China and 
the United States to understand better each other's stances and 
for the solution of the issue. 
  The most-favored-nation statue was originally only a common 
practice in international trade and was not related to politics. 
The United States has given the most-favored-nation status to 
many countries on the basis of mutual benefit. Some of these 
countries have a political system quite different from that of 
the United States, and their concepts of culture and values are 
also entirely different from those of the United States. In 
some of these countries, for example, the women still have no 
right to vote even today. The legal procedures of some of these 
countries are also different from those of the West. However, 
the United States has never linked these questions with the 
most-favored-nation status of these countries. It can thus be 
seen that the United States has linked the issue of human rights 
or the Tibet issue with China's most-favored-status entirely out 
of the political need of exerting pressure on China. This is an 
expression of hegemony and power politics, and this has 
naturally met with China's resolute opposition. 
  Chinese Premier Li Peng told visiting Brzezinski, former 
U.S. 
National Security Advisor, a few days ago, that China does not 
seek a sphere of influence in the world and does not practice 
hegemony, and China resolutely opposes other countries 
practicing hegemony and power politics toward China; China does 
not export its ideology or value concepts to other countries, 
nor does it allow other countries to impose their ideology and 
value concepts on China; and China respects the internal affairs 
of other countries and does not agree to practices of other 
countries of interfering in China's internal affairs or their 
attempts to change the course of development of China. 
  These remarks by Premier Li Peng have explicitly expressed 
the stance of the Chinese Government. The U.S. Government 
should seriously study their meaning, proceed from the overall 
situation of peace and development of the world, and properly 
handle U.S.-Chinese relations. 
  The "Shanghai Communique" signed between China and the 
United 
States in 1972 put forward in an international diplomatic 
document for the first time the idea of opposing hegemony, and 
it has a far-reaching significance. Opposing hegemony is an 
important principle of China's diplomacy. China does not seek 
hegemony and also opposes other countries seeking it. A country 
which keeps talking about human rights should first of all not 
practice hegemony in international affairs. Hegemony is the 
most serious infringement on human rights. The United States, 
for example, involved itself in the war in Vietnam in the past 
and brought great hardships to the Vietnamese. The American 
people also suffered a great deal. Other examples were the 
invasions by the USSR of Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan in the 
past. They were denounced by the whole world. This kind of 
large-scale hegemonic acts of aggression seriously hampered the 
normal social and economic life of the invaded countries and 
encroached upon the national dignity of other countries. The 
cold war is over, but hegemony has not disappeared from the 
scene. It has been expressed in different ways, particularly in 
the field of economy and trade. 
  In his talks with Brzezinski, Li Peng put forward a 
viewpoint 
that the fact that China takes economic construction as the 
center and pursues an independent foreign policy of peace should 
be the basic starting point for foreign observers to understand 
China. China has a population of 1.2 billion people, and the 
governing of such a big country should naturally be based on the 
interests and desires of the overwhelming majority of the 
people. Only in a stable social environment will China be able 
to concentrate its attention on economic construction, and this 
is China's greatest contribution to the world's development and 
peace. If the views of an individual personality are taken at 
every turn as the basis for observing China, the view of the 
important will be overshadowed by the trivial and an erroneous 
conclusion will be made. Since Clinton assumed office, his 
policy toward China has appeared to be more realistic than at 
the time of the election. Last year, he again held a summit 
meeting with China, which has created conditions for seeking 
common ground, while reserving differences, and for developing 
relations between the United States and China. At a meeting with 
Vice Premier Zou Jiahua not long ago, Clinton expressed the hope 
of seeing a strong, stable, and prosperous China. More and more 
people in U.S. political and commercial circles demand that the 
authorities unhook the human rights issue from trade and give 
China long-term most-favored-nation trade status. The Chinese 
Government has also stated clearly that the channels for 
exchanges between China and the United States are open, and the 
two countries also often exchange views on various issues. So 
long as the U.S. side gives up hegemony and power politics, 
Sino-U.S. relations will improve and develop and this conforms 
to the interests of the international community.

  [Text] Liberals and some pro-China figures reacted with 
disappointment and regret at China's withdrawal of an invitation 
to Anthony Cheung Bing-leung to become a Hong Kong affairs 
adviser following his move to align himself with the United 
Democrats, whom China considers subversive. The action came 
just one week before the Meeting Point chairman was due to be 
formally appointed at a ceremony in Beijing. 
  Frederick Fung Kin-kee, the other leading liberal appointed 
as an adviser, said the decision was irrational and "too 
leftist." Mr Fung is chairman of the Association for Democracy 
and People's Livelihood. 
  Some pro-China figures also regretted the decision. 
  Professor Lau Siu-kai, a Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) 
member, said it would deal a blow to people who wanted to 
improve relations with Beijing, and undermine China's ability to 
expand its united front. "If China has made the move in an 
attempt to isolate a few members in the United Democrats of Hong 
Kong, I regret it," he said. 
  Another PWC member, Xu Simin, said the sacking would give 
Hong Kong people an impression that China was narrow-minded. 
  China said Mr Cheung's allegiance to the new coalition -- 
the 
Democratic Party -- deviated from Beijing's policy of appointing 
advisers on the basis of their personal capacity. 
  Mr Cheung said the real reason for his dismissal was his 
leading role in the Democratic Party, which is being formed by 
the merging of the United Democrats and Meeting Point. He 
described Beijing's decision as "illogical, unacceptable, and 
short-sighted". 
  Mr Cheung said yesterday he was told by a local Xinhua (New 
China News Agency) official on Wednesday that his offer had been 
withdrawn because his stance was in breach of the principles of 
appointment. "It's quite obvious that it (the dismissal) has 
something to do with the new party," he said. Mr Cheung said 
that Weng Xingqiao, head of Xinhua's department of education, 
science, and technology, had told him that China did not share 
his view that he should consult the Democratic Party about his 
appointment as an adviser. 
  Mr Weng also told him that Meeting Point's call for an 
amendment to the Basic Law contradicted the role of the advisers 
to promote the post-1997 charter. 
  Mr Cheung said he had told mainland officials that he would 
have to consult Meeting Point on the appointment well before he 
was given the offer. "This applies equally to me when I become 
a Democratic Party member," he said. "If I am dismissed on such 
grounds, what about Allen Lee Peng-fei of the Liberal Party and 
Fredenck Fung Kin-kee of the Association for Democracy and 
People's Livelihood? They have both, understandably, consulted 
their own parties before becoming China advisers." 
  Mr Cheung said it would be a pity for Hong Kong if only 
those 
who stood by the official policies were recruited. "People will 
question why, in order to be an adviser, one has to fulfil so 
many criteria, and whether one could not hold dissenting views 
as an adviser." 
  China believes that accepting Mr Cheung as a party 
representative would turn the advisers group into a 
"battlefield" for political forces.

<F P=106> [By Dong Huifeng (5516 2585 1496)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 18 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Today, while 
meeting a delegation from the Federation of Five Plastics 
Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, Chen Ziying, deputy 
director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, said that the establishment of the Preliminary Working 
Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region [SAR] is completely aimed at 
meeting the need for Hong Kong's smooth transition, for a smooth 
transfer of government power in Hong Kong, and for the 
establishment of the SAR. The attitude the British side takes 
toward the PWC is a touchstone for judging whether the British 
side is willing to maintain Hong Kong's smooth transition and is 
willing to cooperate with the Chinese side. 
  Chen Ziying pointed out: After the breakdown of the 
Sino-British political talks, the Chinese side is still willing 
to cooperate with the British side on other issues, but this is 
contingent on the British side's attitude. We hope that the 
British side will show sincerity and will not repeat its 
practice concerning political issues in the past. 
  He said: Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland are situated in 
the Asia-Pacific economic belt, which has recorded the fastest 
development in the world. Maintaining a smooth transition for 
Hong Kong is not only beneficial to the mainland and Hong Kong, 
but also to other sides with economic interests in Hong Kong. 
Some people in the British Hong Kong authorities always 
misjudge the situation and draw erroneous conclusions. This 
will just cause losses to their own interests. 
  He added: A distinct difference between clever people and 
foolish people lies in the fact that the former do not repeat 
the same mistakes they committed before. It is hoped that they 
are clever now. 
  Chen Ziying said: The recent meetings of the political and 
economic affairs groups of the PWC were quite successful. 
First, the PWC members had an opportunity to listen to opinions 
from people in various circles in Hong Kong. Second, the PWC's 
mainland members had a chance to know more about the actual 
conditions in Hong Kong. This enabled them to put forth 
proposals and opinions more pertinent to the actual conditions 
of Hong Kong and to the wishes of Hong Kong people. Therefore, 
the other three groups of the PWC will also hold meetings in 
Hong Kong next year. 
  When talking about the economic relationship between Hong 
Kong and the mainland, Chen Ziying said that the two sides were 
closely integrated with each other. For example, there are tens 
of thousands of Hong Kong-funded enterprises in the Zhu Jiang 
Delta area, almost all of the major new property projects in 
Beijing involve Hong Kong investment, and more mainland 
state-owned enterprises will be listed on the Hong Kong stock 
market. All this shows that cooperation between the two sides 
has been speeding up, and the scope for cooperation is expanding 
with bright prospects for the future. 
  Finally, Chen Ziying said that Hong Kong's smooth transition 
and long-term prosperity will eventually depend on Hong Kong 
people themselves. Even if the British side refuses to 
cooperate in the last stage of the transitional period, Hong 
Kong will maintain its status as an international financial and 
trade center after 1997. 
  Zhang Liangdong, director of the Hong Kong Economic Affairs 
Department of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, attended 
the meeting held at the Xindadu Hotel in Beijing. 
  The 42-member delegation from the Hong Kong plastics 
industry 
is headed by Mr. Leung Kei-yau.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 18 (CNS) -- Member of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC) and Hong Kong Affairs Adviser, Mr. Yu 
Kwok-chun, speaking in an interview with the Hong Kong China 
News Agency, expressed that early preparations for the issuance 
of passports of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region 
(SAR) and consultation with foreign countries on mutual 
exemption of visas was an important matter for the smooth 
transition of Hong Kong, adding that if the British Hong Kong 
government was sincere to maintain the prosperity and stability 
in the territory, it should engage in active coordination to the 
issuing of such passports. 
  Mr. Yu said that it was very necessary for the Preliminary 
Committee [as received] for the Preparatory Committee of the SAR 
as well as its security affairs group to discuss at present the 
preparatory work on the issuance of the SAR passports, since 
there were only more than three years to come from now on to the 
hand-over of sovereignty right of Hong Kong in 1997. In this 
period, the preliminary work on this matter should be carried 
out. In addition, such passports should be publicized and 
popularized overseas in order to make them acceptable in more 
countries and passports issued by foreign countries would be, in 
return, recognized in Hong Kong. 
  Mr. Yu pointed out that the issuance in advance of SAR's 
passports to those China's citizens who were holding permanent 
residential identity cards certainly required the British Hong 
Kong Government to provide related materials of passport 
applicants, the issuance of this kind of passports must be 
responsible both for Hong Kong people and those countries by 
which these passports were accepted therefore they could not be 
issued in an irresponsible way. 
  The adviser held that should the work of the passport 
issuance be done after 1997, the two kinds of passports would 
not dovetail, creating inconveniences for Hong Kong residents in 
their travels and businesses overseas as well as unfavorable 
influence to the territory.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 20 (AFP)--Britain and China failed 
yet again Friday to agree on the financing of Hong Kong's 
mammoth new airport, although both sides claimed they were 
making some headway. 
  "The fact is, there are still questions in the Chinese 
minds," the chief British negotiator, Hugh Davies, told 
reporters after the first meeting of the Joint Liaison Group 
airport committee in nine months. 
  "We're disappointed. We would like to have seen more 
progress," he said. "But on the whole, we found the atmosphere 
positive, and I think we're on the right track." 
  His Chinese counterpart, Guo Fengmin, was somewhat more 
upbeat, saying the two sides had made "positive progress" and 
even found common ground on some issues, which he did specify. 
  "But we still have work to do," Guo said, indicating a 
decision is not yet in sight on how to pay for the 20.3 billion 
U.S. dollar Chek Lap Kok airport and related public works. 
  The new airport, off the outlying island of Lantao, is due 
to 
replace congested inner-city Kai Tak airport in 1997, when Hong 
Kong reverts to China, and is one of the biggest public works 
projects in the world today. 
  But although site preparation work is well under way, 
Britain 
and China have long been at loggerheads over the amount of debt 
that should be raised to pay for the vast undertaking. 
  The issue has also been overshadowed by China's shrill 
attacks on Governor Chris Patten's attempts to extend democracy 
in Hong Kong, although Beijing has suggested in recent weeks 
that it might separate the two issues. 
  Davies said Britain's fourth and latest financing proposal 
-- 
which calls for 60 billion Hong Kong dollars (7.76 billion U.S.) 
to be injected as equity from Hong Kong's bulging reserves -- 
was still very much alive. 
  "There are still various quesions within the overall 
financing package that need to be resolved," he said, adding 
that agreement could happen "rapidly" if the Chinese side 
accepted Britain's terms. 
  More talks are to be held at the expert level, but no date 
was set for another meeting of the airport committee, Davies 
said. 
  He also said the airport issue was unlikely to come up at 
the 
next full meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, the 
diplomatic body charged with hammering out the technical details 
of Hong Kong's change of sovereignty.

<F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] Seven days of talks on the disposal of military 
land ended fruitlessly yesterday, with China accusing Britain of 
a lack of cooperation. 
  The failure dashed hopes of a long-expected deal at the 
Joint 
Liaison Group session expected to be held early next month. 
  Emerging from yesterday's talks, Chinese team leader Chen 
Zuoer lamented that China's reasonable appeals for information 
had been unsuccessful. 
  He criticised the British side for holding back information 
China had been seeking for the past seven years, but did not 
specify what was wanted. 
  And he rejected "rumours" that China had made new demands on 
the handover of military sites. 
  China has reportedly asked for a slightly bigger naval basin 
and decided to hold back one of the 25 military sites it had 
promised to hand to the Hong Kong Government for development. 
  "This does not comply with the facts. The fact is that the 
talks on the handover of the military sites are still going on 
between the two governments, and this will continue," he said. 
  His British counterpart, Alan Paul, attributed the failure 
to 
the complicated nature of the issue. 
  "If it were not, we would not have been talking about it for 
seven years," he said. 
  "We have done our best over this time to reach an agreement. 
We have not been successful. We are obviously disappointed but 
not despondent because both sides will continue to strive for 
agreement." 
  It is understood the British side deemed the new Chinese 
demands to be unacceptable, both to them and to the Legislative 
Council which will have to approve funds to reprovisioning of 
military facilities for China. 
  Foreign Office spokesman Bill Dickson said he was not aware 
of Mr Chen's claims of secrecy: "The British side has gone to 
enormous lengths to provide the Chinese delegation with 
information." 
  He said he did not expect yesterday's outcome to have any 
impact on the Joint Liaison Group plenum. 
  In Beijing, a senior mainland official warned Britain not to 
repeat the mistakes of the political negotiations when it seeks 
co- operation on other issues. 
  "China still wants to have co-operation on other issues... 
(We) hope that the British side can show sincerity and not 
repeat what it has done over the political question," said the 
deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Chen 
Ziying. 
  "The difference between clever and stupid people is that the 
former will not repeat the same mistake. (We) hope that we are 
all clever people," he told a business delegation from Hong Kong. 
  Earlier, in the territory, a deputy director of XINHUA (the 
New China News Agency), Zhang Junsheng, accused Britain of 
leaking to the press its determination to push ahead with the 
airport financing arrangement outlined in the fourth package of 
proposals. 
  Mr Zhang said Britain should make its stance clear at the 
Airport Committee meeting set for this week. 
  "Any problems between China and Britain should be sorted out 
through the Airport Committee discussions. The fact that 
Britain announced the re-opening of the talks while at the same 
time unilaterally publicising its stance on the fourth proposal 
will have a detrimental effect," he said.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 20 (AFP)--Cronies and relatives of 
China's ruling elite are at the centre of a multi-billion-dollar 
fraud, setting up their own firms in Hong Kong and then loading 
them up with Chinese state assets, financial sources here said. 
  Mainland assets worth more than three billion dollars have 
been squirrelled away in these firms, which also generate 
profits that go back into private pockets rather than to the 
state, they said. 
  Hong Kong and Chinese financial watchdogs are impotent to 
combat the fraud, which is masked by a thick-woven web of 
personal contacts and exploits differing financial controls in 
the British colony and the Communist mainland. 
  The fraud entails so-called "nominee" firms which are set up 
in Hong Kong by mainland Chinese. There are around 2,000 at 
present, either publicly listed or wholly privately-owned. 
  Reliable sources in the Hong Kong banking world said many of 
these "nominee" firms had been loaded up with assets from some 
of the 50 Chinese state-owned firms which have now registered in 
Hong Kong and comprise seven percent of the market's 
capitalisation. 
  "In my estimate, at least three billion dollars in assets 
have been swindled," a Japanese banking official, whose company 
has widespread business interests in China, said. 
  The asset transfer goes via a so-called "backdoor listing," 
in which a shell company is set up by an individual, and then 
the Hong Kong-listed state firm buys into its capital and hands 
over some assets, such as factories, office buildings and land. 
  In this way, the transferred assets become "joint ventures," 
a status that gives them big tax advantages in China and also 
protects them from being sold, should China ever decide to 
privatise its state sector. 
  Profits from the venture are recycled into secret bank 
accounts, used for property or stock speculation in Hong Kong, 
or "reinvested" as share options in the nominee firm, sources 
said. 
  A Chinese Communist official in charge of overseeing Chinese 
firms in Hong Kong said he was bitter and frustrated at the 
extent of the scam. 
  "Money now rules these state-owned enterprises," he said. 
"They no longer think of the welfare of the party or the state." 
  The sources said a core of figures, known as "taizidang," or 
princelings, was most active in the scam, many of them the 
offspring of party leaders and political chiefs surrounding 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who opened up China's economy. 
  Hong Kong financial regulators say they cannot interfere in 
the activities of these firms, as under Hong Kong law nothing 
illegal has been done because assets are on Chinese soil. 
  Speaking for mainland businesses in the territory, Chao 
Suicong, vice chairman of the Chinese Enterprises Association in 
Hong Kong, said: "All our members have been approved by the 
state, and they follow Chinese policy and Hong Kong law." 
  "So far, we haven't heard of any of our members stealing 
state assets." 
  Despite this official serenity, the Chinese government is 
showing signs of deep disquiet at the scent of corruption and 
its dwindling stock of state assets. 
  According to official estimates, cited by XINHUA news agency 
Sunday, cheap sales of state assets have cost the country 60 
billion dollars over the past decade. 
  The State Council, or cabinet, has now issued a circular 
tightening regulations governing transfer of state property, 
requiring all assets to be accurately evaluated and banning all 
transfers at an "unrealistically low price" or on credit. 
  It also requires all sales of property by local state firms 
to be approved by city administrations above prefectural level, 
while deals involving large enterprises and those under central 
management must be forwarded to the State Council. 
  The move intends belatedly to reassert central control over 
the behemoths, analysts said. 
  State firms which have a listing in Hong Kong report not to 
their nominal ministry as other state enterprises do, but to 
their local governments -- a factor that has boosted regional 
political power as well as cronyism.

  [Text] London, May 19 (XINHUA) -- A number of UK peers on 
Wednesday [18 May] criticized British Government's policy on 
Hong Kong, warning that it could bring about serious 
consequences to Hong Kong and to the relationship between 
Britain and China as well. 
  Speaking at a House of Lords debate on Hong Kong, Lord 
Cromer, a leading British businessman in Hong Kong, said, "It is 
my view, and a view I would add that is shared by much of the 
community in Hong Kong, that her Majesty's government has 
embarked on a policy in Hong Kong that is seriously flawed." 
  "It is a policy that is aiming to bring to Hong Kong a 
political system which...[ellipses as received] May not 
ultimately be compatible with Hong Kong's aspirations," he said. 
  "It is also a policy which flies in the face of an immensely 
painstaking and ultimately highly successful series of 
negotiations...[ellipses as received] Which led to the signing 
of the joint declaration in 1984," he added. 
  Refuting Chris Patten's claim that there was a "clear wish" 
in Hong Kong for further movement towards democracy, Lord Cromer 
said that no one has yet been able to provide any evidence that 
there was any such clear wish among the great majority of the 
people in Hong Kong. 
  "What Hong Kong people want is prosperity, not democracy," 
he 
told the House. 
  He pointed out that by insisting on constitutional changes 
in 
Hong Kong against Chinese objections, "the British side has 
chosen a path that has led to confrontation" with China. 
  "Why have we put at risk a relationship with the world's 
most 
populous nation in order to offer something to the people of 
Hong Kong that is not within our power to deliver?" he asked. 
  In his speech at the debate, former Hong Kong Governor Lord 
MacLehose said that he was "critical of manner in which the 
attempted reforms have been approached at this time." 
  Chris Patten's constitutional initiative had proved to be a 
"serious mistake" and was "unlikely to do the people of Hong 
Kong any good," he commented. 
  He warned that "there may be a mood of disillusionment with 
Britain and with the British Government when it becomes apparent 
that all these activities on the constitutional front have so 
little practical content for the people of Hong Kong." 
  Another former Hong Kong governor, Lord Wilson, reminded his 
fellow Lords that the Chinese Government had made it clear that 
if there is no agreement between the two countries, any new 
arrangements in Hong Kong will not survive 1997. 
  "That statement, I believe, needs to be taken seriously," he 
said. 
  He pointed out that to ensure smooth transition and to 
maintain stability and prosperity in Hong Kong before and after 
1997, the "guiding star" for the British policy "must surely be 
not the short term, but the medium and long term." 
  "We must do as much as we possibly can, wherever possible in 
co-operation with China, to achieve what is right and beneficial 
for the people of Hong Kong and for the success of the Hong Kong 
special administrative region after 1997," he said.

<F P=106> [By Agatha Ngai] </F>
  [Text] The internationally-acclaimed director Zhang 
Yimou's banned movie Huozhuo should not be shown in Hong Kong 
unless local distributors obtain clearance from the Chinese 
authorities, a local Chinese official warned yesterday. 
  Speaking at a function to promote next year's film festival 
in Shanghai, Cui Songming, the deputy head of the cultural and 
sports department of the Xinhua (New China News Agency) office 
in Hong Kong, said approval from China's Ministry of Radio, Film 
and Television was needed before the movie could be shown. 
  "There was always a clear requirement in China that any 
movies, including those whose post-production was done in the 
mainland, should be censored by the Ministry of Radio, Film and 
Television." 
  He said Hong Kong movie-makers should respect China's system 
and follow the procedures when they went to the mainland to make 
movies as a realisation of the "one country, two systems" 
principle. 
  "If the related parties decide to film the movie (without 
passing the censorship in China) arbitrarily, it will no doubt 
cause disturbances between two places," he said. 
  The deputy head also used the movie, Farewell, My Concubine, 
as an example of how local producers had taken advantage of the 
"confusion" in China and screened the movie in Hong Kong without 
Beijing's approval. 
  When asked about director Zhang's absence from the Cannes 
film festival as a protest against the censorship of his film, 
Mr Cui said: "You may say the Government is tightening its 
policy on film. But, I think, it's necessary to rectify the 
discipline in the cultural industry. 
  "It's usual for a country to have some internal regulations. 
I don't think the move will discourage film-makers from coming 
to China." 
  He said artists should not feel concerned by the controls. 
Mr Cui said each movie's script should be censored before the 
actual production began, and artists would not run into any 
problems if directors followed the censored copy. 
  Huozhou, a top contender at the Cannes film festival, tells 
the story of three generations of a family living through the 
China of the 1940s, 50s and 60s, including the Great Leap 
Forward and the Cultural Revolution. 
  Sources said although the film itself carried no political 
message, the authorities were not happy with its depiction of 
the various political campaigns in China. 
  A local artist who has expressed an interest in the local 
distribution of Huozhuo said yesterday a copy of the movie would 
be submitted to local censors and he hoped permission to screen 
the movie would soon be obtained. 
  But the artist did not want to comment on the Xinhua 
official's statement, saying the whole process was at a 
"preliminary stage". 
  Speaking at the same promotion yesterday, mainland director 
Xie Jin said the recent tightening of China's art policy had had 
little effect on his works. 
  The president of the Shanghai School of Performance said it 
was normal practice for a mainland production to apply for a 
censor visa from the Government. 
  "I don't think the procedures will affect film-makers' 
creativity."

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 KYODO -- North Korea's ambassador 
to China said Friday [20 May] that the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) can inspect and measure spent fuel rods 
from their nuclear reactor only after bilateral talks with the 
United States are resumed. 
  Ambassador Chu Chang-chun told reporters the dialogue with 
the U.S., which was suspended after two rounds last July, should 
be continued if the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is to 
be resolved. 
  Technicians at North Korea's 5-megawatt Yongbyon 
experimental 
nuclear reactor began replacing spent fuel rods Saturday without 
inspectors from the IAEA present, a move which violates the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and other agreements 
between North Korea and the IAEA. 
  Three IAEA inspectors now at Yongbyon have not been allowed 
to take samples or make tests on the spent rods, reports said. 
  "We will contain the spent fuel rods in a safe place and 
display them before the inspectors. Then the inspectors can 
verify that our nuclear materials have not been diverted to 
nonpeaceful purposes," Chu said. 
  "This will be the inspection for the continuity of the 
safeguards, this is to show the transparency of our nuclear 
activities," he said. 
  "When the third round of talks between the DPRK (North 
Korea) 
and the U.S. are held and a package solution is realized, then 
the agency (IAEA) can take the measurements at any time," he 
added. 
  The Vienna-based IAEA has insisted that the spent rods must 
be sorted and examined to see whether any spent fuel has been 
diverted to North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. 
  Chu claimed that North Korea unilaterally suspended 
withdrawal from the NPT last summer when talks with the U.S. 
began and now has ''a special status'' within the treaty which 
releases it from its NPT obligations. 
  ''We cannot allow the agency to conduct the routine and ad 
hoc inspections because it is contrary to the special status of 
our country,'' Chu said. 
  The ambassador blamed the U.S. for fabricating the North 
Korean nuclear issue as a means to slander his country, while 
demanding that the U.S. honor its commitment to provide 
Pyongyang with a light-water nuclear reactor. 
  Chu also accused Japan of nuclear ambitions, while 
continuing 
to maintain that up to 1,000 nuclear devices are on the Korean 
peninsula and they are all U.S.-made. 
  "That is why we insist that talks be held between the DPRK 
and the U.S.," he said. 
  The 15-month-long dispute has become central to North Korean 
relations with the U.S. as well as the eventual easing of 
tension and possible reunification of the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The Red Cross Society 
of the People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today repeated its 
demand that Seoul return two soldiers detained since the Korean 
War. 
  In a telephone message, the acting chairman of the Central 
Committee of DPRK's Red Cross Society, Yi Song-ho, told South 
Korean Red Cross President Kang Yong-hun that Seoul should 
return the two Korean People's Army soldiers, Kim In-so and Ham 
Se-hwan. 
  DPRK's red cross has sent messages to its South Korean 
counterpart on April 26 and 27, demanding the return of the two 
prisoners of war. 
  However, the South Korean Red Cross has made no response. 
  "This cannot be deemed righteous behavior on the part of the 
Red Cross officials whose essential mission is to show noble 
humanitarianism by saving human beings from misfortunes and 
helping them," Yi said. 
  The two soldiers were taken prisoners by the U.S. Forces 
while engaging in guerrilla activities in the South Korean area 
during the Korean war, he noted. 
  "They are obviously prisoners of war taking in account 
international law, and your side is obliged to send them back to 
our side," read the message. 
  Yi urged the South Korean Red Cross not to follow the south 
side's authorities pursuing north-south confrontation, but to 
remain faithful to its duty as a Red Cross organization. 
  Meanwhile, Yi also asked the south to allow Kim Chi-hyon, 
daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, who was an unconverted prisoner, to 
return to DPRK for medical treatment. 
  Kim Chi-hyon, who was born in the north, was suffering from 
"a serious illness," according to the message.

  [Text] Seoul, May 20 (XINHUA) -- South Korea expressed 
concern Friday [20 May] over reports that the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team conducting inspection in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) confirmed Pyongyang 
has already begun withdrawing spent fuel rods from its 
5-megawatt nuclear reactor. 
  "We express regret and concern over the IAEA inspection team 
confirming that North Korea has started replacing spent fuel 
rods at the 5-megawatt reactor on its own," Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said here. 
  The DPRK notified the United States and the IAEA 
respectively 
earlier that it could no longer defer removal of the nuclear 
fuel rods from its reactor due to technical reasons. 
  Chang said that the South Korean Government will await the 
results of negotiations between the DPRK and the IAEA, then 
discuss the necessary safety steps after refueling and consult 
closely with its allies on follow-up measures. 
  "The government is paying heed to the IAEA announcement that 
there is still room for safety measures if North Korea stops 
withdrawing at this stage," he noted. 
  The IAEA inspection team said that the DPRK is still in the 
early stage of replacing spent fuel rods. 
  As the IAEA has proposed sending delegates to discuss 
safeguards needed in the refueling process for safety reasons, 
South Korea is asking the DPRK to abide by nuclear safeguards 
after immediate talks with the IAEA, Chang said. 
  Meanwhile, South Korea decided Friday to consider asking the 
United Nations Security Council to take additional action if the 
DPRK rejects the IAEA's proposal to suspend the changing of fuel 
rods at its reactor and permit complete inspection. 
  The decision was made at a unification and security policy 
coordination meeting attended by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime 
minister and national unification board minister, and other 
related ministers.

  [Text] Singapore, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Opening-up is the key 
to the common development of all countries and regions in the 
world, Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing said here today, 
expressing his concerns over rising protectionism. 
  He said, "opening-up is not only the key to China's 
development, but also the key to the development of all 
countries and regions of the world." 
  He expressed "frankly" his concerns over the fact that trade 
protectionism in some countries and regional grouping "is still 
gaining ground," though the Uruguay round of GATT (General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks produced the final act and 
the world trade organization is to be established soon. 
  "In my opinion, such a tendency is not only affecting the 
healthy development of the world trade and economy, but is also 
detrimental to their own long term development," Li said, while 
addressing the international conference of "waves of the future 
- ASEAN, Vietnam and China: Opportunities for World Business". 
  The meeting was attended by more than 800 delegates, mostly 
senior government leaders and officials, businessmen, and policy 
researchers, from 21 countries and regions of the world. 
  China adopts positive attitude towards economic cooperation 
in Asia-Pacific, Li said. 
  But he was quick to add that such cooperation should be 
based 
on full respect for state sovereignty, equality, mutual benefit 
and openness, and comply with the rules of the world 
multilateral trading system. 
  Any "cooperation" which is exclusionary and leads to growth 
of instabilizing elements in the world is totally different from 
what China stands for, he stressed. 
  Citing experiences in the history of the two world wars, Li 
said that exclusionary self-development would lead to division 
of sphere of influence, growing imbalance of development and 
fight for places of origin of raw materials and markets for 
goods as well as outlets for capital and technology. 
  In this context, he reiterated China's position that it 
never 
seeks sphere of influence, has no intention of filling the 
"vacuum" left over after the end of the Cold War and strongly 
opposes division of sphere of influence. 
  "To boost the openness of the whole world and every part of 
it is exactly what we should advocate," he said.

  [Text] Singapore, May 20 (XINHUA) -- China and Singapore 
today reaffirmed their pledge to ensure the smooth progress of 
the Suzhou industrial park project aiming to promote economic 
cooperation in the city of Suzhou in southern part of China. 
  Visiting Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore 
Deputy 
Prime Minister Lee Hsieng Loong made the reaffirmation at the 
inaugural meeting of the Joint Steering Council (JSC) of the 
project, which was the first since China and Singapore signed 
the agreement on the Suzhou industrial park project in Beijing 
in February this year. 
  Under the agreement, the Suzhou Municipal Government and 
Singapore agencies would jointly develop a modern industrial 
park of 70 square kilometers at Suzhou. Singapore also agreed 
to make its public administration "software" available to the 
Suzhou project. 
  At today's JSC meeting, the two countries reaffirmed their 
commitment to giving their "fullest support" to the Suzhou 
industrial park project, the Singapore Ministry of Trade and 
Industry said in a statement at the end of the JSC meeting. 
  "Both sides will spare no efforts to ensure the smooth 
progress of the project," it said. 
  In his speech at the opening of the JSC meeting, Li Lanqing 
said the cooperation between China and Singapore in jointly 
developing the Suzhou industrial park is a matter of great 
importance in the history of bilateral economic cooperation. 
  He proposed that the principle of equality and mutual 
benefit, and sincere cooperation be the guideline in undertaking 
the construction work of the Suzhou industrial park. 
  While expressing his satisfaction with the progress made in 
the project so far, the Chinese vice premier said that so long 
as the two sides proceed in the spirit of this principle, all 
the difficulties that might appear in the process of the project 
can be overcome. 
  Lee Hsieng Loong said the Suzhou project "is a major 
collaborative project of our two countries". 
  "Singapore is fully committed to the Suzhou project. We will 
spare no effort to ensure the success of the software transfer," 
he stressed. 
  "Given the goodwill and commitment which both sides have 
demonstrated in embarking on this project, I am confident that 
Suzhou industrial township will overcome all obstacles, and 
fulfill the hopes which we have invested in it," Lee said. 
  According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the JSC 
will 
meet every year after this inaugural meeting. The next meeting 
will be held in Suzhou in May 1995, to coincide with the 
completion of the first factory in the initial 10 hectare 
industrial park.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The China National 
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) today dismissed a Vietnamese 
accusation that CNOOC had violated its sovereignty and rejected 
its ensuing demands. 
  CNOOC Spokesman Chen Bingqian said at a press conference 
today that the "Wan'an Bei-21" contract, signed in 1992 by CNOOC 
and the U.S. Crestone Energy Corporation, over which Vietnam's 
claim was made, is "legally binding." 
  He said the contract block, located in the Nansha [Spratly] 
offshore area, falls within China's jurisdiction. "CNOOC and 
Crestone have the right to undertake normal operations in this 
area," he stated. 
  On April 25 a Vietnamese press release claimed Crestone and 
CNOOC had "violated" the sovereign rights of Vietnam by signing 
the contract for "Wan'an Bei-21" oil exploration. 
  It further demanded the termination of the contract and 
cancellation of all related activities. 
  "Our company will absolutely not accept the accusation, as 
well as the unreasonable demands," Chen said. 
  The "Wan'an Bei-21" contract covers an area of more than 
25,000 square kilometers in the South China Sea. The 
undersigner should be responsible for laying seismic lines and 
drilling exploratory wells during the contractual period of 
seven years. 
  "It must be pointed out that recently Vietnam Oil and Gas 
Corporation has set aside a batch of blocks of the Nansha 
islands for bids from foreign companies, and some foreign 
companies have entered into contracts for oil and gas 
exploration and exploitation, which constitute violations of 
China's sovereignty over the Nansha offshore area and also 
infringes on our company's interests," Chen warned. 
  "It is known to all that the Chinese Government has 
repeatedly called for shelving the disputes and participating in 
joint development before a solution to the Nansha issue can be 
reached," he said. 
  Therefore, he said, "CNOOC welcomes relevant parties, 
including Vietnam Oil and Gas Corporation, to cooperate with us 
and to explore the possibility of joint development."

  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (XINHUA) -- Chen Bingqian, 
spokesman for the China Offshore Petroleum Corporation, issued 
the following statement here today in connection with the 
Wananbei contract: 
  On 25 April, a Vietnamese newspaper published an article 
entitled "We Oppose the Crestone Energy Corporation for Engaging 
in Illegal Activities in the Sizhengtan Area (that is, the 
Wanantan in China's Nansha Islands) Which Falls Under Vietnam's 
Sovereignty," claiming that the "Wananbei-21" petroleum 
prospecting and exploitation contract concluded between the 
Crestone Energy Corporation of the United States and the China 
Offshore Petroleum Corporation "has encroached upon" Vietnam's 
sovereignty. The article demanded that the contract be canceled 
and that all activities in connection with the contract be 
suspended. 
  The "Wananbei-21" contract concluded in 1992 between the 
corporation and the Crestone Energy Corporation of the United 
States is a contract with legal effect. The area covered in the 
contract is within the territorial waters of the Nansha Islands, 
which are within the jurisdiction of China and are within 
China's sovereignty. Our corporation and the contracting U.S. 
company have the right to engage in normal operations in the 
said territorial waters. The abovementioned accusations and 
demands by Vietnam are totally unacceptable to our corporation. 
  It must be pointed out that in recent years the Vietnam 
Petroleum and Gas Corporation has carved up a number of zones in 
the territorial waters of China's Nansha Islands and invited 
bidding by foreign companies. A number of foreign companies 
have concluded contracts with the Vietnamese corporation to 
exploit oil and gas. This has violated China's sovereignty over 
the territorial waters of the Nansha Islands and has also 
encroached upon our corporation's interests. 
  The Chinese Government has pointed out on many occasions 
that 
before the disputes over the Nansha issue are solved, the 
disputes should be shelved for the time being in order to 
participate in a joint development program. For this reason, 
the China Offshore Petroleum Corporation welcomes relevant 
companies, including the Vietnam Petroleum and Gas Corporation, 
to cooperate with us and to join us in exploring the possibility 
of joint development.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Firm Slams Vietnamese Activity in </F>
Nansha"] 
  [Text] A Vietnamese company has violated China's 
sovereignty in the Nansha Islands [Spratlys], a Chinese oil firm 
said yesterday in Beijing. 
  It said the activities of the Vietnam Oil and Gas 
Corporation 
in the South China Sea area have also infringed on China's 
offshore oil interests. 
  Chen Bingqian, spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil 
Corporation (CNOOC), said the Vietnamese company recently marked 
a group of blocks around the Nansha Islands for foreign bidding. 
  Moreover, the Vietnamese company has entered contracts with 
overseas partners to explore the area. Chen did not disclose 
the names of the foreign firms. 
  "This has violated China's sovereignty rights over the 
Nansha 
offshore area and also infringed on our company's interests," he 
said. 
  Chen also stressed that China will not accept any Vietnamese 
denouncement of CNOOC and its partners' exploration of the area. 
Last month a Vietnamese newspaper accused CNOOC and a US firm of 
violating Vietnam's sovereignty by signing a contract to develop 
the socalled Si Zhen Tan block. 
  The area, named Wan An Tan in Chinese, is located in the 
Nansha offshore area under China's jurisdiction, Chen said. 
  CNOOC and Crestone of the U.S. agreed in 1992 to develop the 
25,000 square metre block in a deal called Wan An Bei-21. 
  According to the contract, CNOOC and Crestone are to conduct 
seismic work and drilling in the section. 
  The Vietnamese article called for the termination of the 
contract and all related activities, Chen said. 
  But he said the contract has legal binding force and CNOOC 
and Crestone are entitled to operate in the area. 
  "We cannot accept unreasonable demands made by Vietnam," he 
said. 
  Chen said CNOOC has followed Chinese policy. 
  The government has stated that disputes in the Nansha issue 
may be put aside and joint development with the Vietnamese can 
be made.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Xie Dongfeng: "'Arafat's Remark Sparks </F>
Controversy in Israel"] 
  [Text] Jerusalem, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The Palestine 
Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's call for 
Islamic jihad (holy war) to liberate Jerusalem has sparked sharp 
controversy in Israel's political spheres. 
  Last week, 'Arafat spoke in a mosque in South Africa that 
"you have to come and launch jihad to liberate Jerusalem, your 
third shrine." 
  Under pressure from Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, 
'Arafat clarified his statement Wednesday at a press conference 
in Oslo by saying that he meant "peaceful jihad." 
  'Arafat promised to crusade for peace and reassured Israel 
that he had urged Moslems to wage a holy war for Jerusalem only 
in a religious sense. 
  However, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin did not accept 
'Arafat's such clarification Wednesday, saying it was 
"far-fetched." 
  Rabin said here that 'Arafat's call for jihad was making the 
peace process with the Palestinians more difficult and would 
continue to do so in the future. 
  Both 'Arafat and Peres attended a ceremony organized by the 
Atlanta-based Jimmy Carter Center honoring Norway's contribution 
to the Middle East peace process. 
  After hearing 'Arafat's clarification, Peres said that "this 
was the minimum that I expected to hear, the situation was not 
simple. This is what was needed, or else, I would not have come." 
  Earlier, Peres boycotted a lunch with 'Arafat, saying he 
would not attend a joint event until 'Arafat issued a clarifying 
statement. 
  On Tuesday, Rabin said that the future of the peace process 
will come into question unless 'Arafat clarifies his call for 
jihad. 
  If this statement is repeated, Rabin said, "this would be a 
clear violation of a basic element of the continuation of the 
process." 
  "Therefore, we will ask for a clarification, and there is no 
doubt in my mind, Israel will not be able to accept such a 
violation and to continue the process between the PLO and us," 
he said. 
  Under the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed in 
Washington on September 13, 1993, the issue of the status of 
Jerusalem will be resolved by political means and will be 
discussed in 1996. 
  Meanwhile, the opposition Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu 
said Tuesday that Rabin's reaction to 'Arafat's call for jihad 
was "totally unsatisfactory." 
  "'Arafat has revealed just how much it is Gaza and Jericho 
first, with all of the other (occupied) territories and 
Jerusalem slated to follow," he said. 
  A peace deal has just been signed, and now 'Arafat is 
declaring a holy war to liberate Jerusalem, he said. 
  Netanyahu urged Rabin to "do more than just pay weak lip 
service," adding that "he must shut down the PLO offices in East 
Jerusalem and prevent Faysal al-Husayni and Sari Nusaybah from 
serving on PLO negotiating teams and in the autonomy 
institutions." 
  The National Religious Party, which also opposes the peace 
process, said that "by giving up Jericho, the government has 
made Jerusalem and its vicinity all the more vulnerable to 
'Arafat and his bands of terrorists, no matter what cover name 
they use." 
  It is reported that the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, 
will 
hold a number of debates in the next few days on 'Arafat's call 
for jihad. 
  Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and has declared a 
united Jerusalem as its eternal and undivided capital. 
  But the Palestinians have been claiming that East Jerusalem 
is part of the occupied territories and should be returned to 
the Palestinians in accordance with UN resolutions which call on 
Israel to return all the occupied territories to Arabs. 
  So far, Israel has completed its army withdrawal from 
Jericho 
and the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Peres and 'Arafat had agreed in 
Oslo on the principles on widening authority of autonomy to the 
other parts of the West Bank.

  [Text] Beirut, May 22 (XINHUA) -- Lebanese Prime Minister 
Rafiq al-Hirawi expressed here today the hope of his country for 
a further development of relations with China. 
  Al-Hirawi summoned to his office this morning Chinese 
Ambassador to Lebanon Zhu Peiqing who described afterwards the 
atmosphere of his talks with the Lebanese prime minister as 
"friendly and cordial." 
  Zhu said the two sides explored ways to enhance the ties 
between Lebanon and China, especially in the economic and 
financial fields. 
  The Lebanese prime minister expressed his satisfaction 
towards the developments of the two country's relations after he 
took office in October, 1992. 
  Al-Hirawi hoped that China would take advantage of Lebanon's 
geographical position in the Middle East region in order to 
expand the cooperation in the economic and trade domains.

<F P=106> [By Hu Xiaoming: "Chinese Hostages in Afghanistan To Be </F>
Released Soon"] 
  [Text] Islamabad, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Two Chinese hostages, 
who have been kept in Afghanistan for almost a year, will be 
released very soon, an Afghan source said here today. 
  "We'll try to do something. We hope it will be successful," 
Hamed Gilani, deputy chief of the National Islamic Front of 
Afghanistan led by Syed Ahmed Gilani, said in a special 
interview. 
  The two Chinese engineers, Wang Qingpin, about 30, and Zheng 
Hongbao, about 40, were kidnapped while working on a project on 
June 21 last year at Bostan along Pak-Afghan border, some 30 
kilometers from Quetta, capital of Pakistan's Baluchistan 
Province. 
  The Afghan kidnappers, led by Mullah Salam Rocketi [name as 
received], held them in Qalat-e Ghelza'i District in Zabol 
Province in Afghanistan. 
  Hamed Gilani said his cousin, 'Abdol Qadir Gilani, will go 
to 
Qalat-e Ghelza'i and get the two Chinese and other Pakistani 
hostages released after 'Eid, the biggest holiday for Muslims 
which falls on May 22. 
  'Abdol Qadir Gilani has recently met Mullah Salam Rocketi, 
and the two Chinese engineers and secured the release of two 
Pakistani hostages. 
  Besides the two Chinese engineers, nine Pakistani people, 
including Ata Mohammad, deputy commissioner of Ziarat District 
in Baluchistan Province, have also been taken hostage by 
Rocketi's group. 
  Rocketi has been demanding a ransom of 600 million rupees 
(about 20 million U.S. dollars), return of three Stinger 
missiles allegedly captured by Pakistani troops and release of 
his younger brother jailed in Pakistan. 
  The two Chinese hostages recently wrote a letter to Chinese 
Ambassador in Pakistan, Zhou Gang, complaining about the inhuman 
treatment they received. 
  They said they had to get up early in the morning to collect 
firewood. They could not even get food or would be beaten badly 
if they did not obey the kidnappers' order or did not finish the 
job. 
  Some reports said the two Chinese engineers were sexually 
abused by the bandits. 
  "We make it very clear that our talks with Rocketi are 
unconditional, and Rocketi has responded very positively," Hamid 
Gillani said. 
  Seyyed Ahmed Gilani, father of Hamed Gilani, is an 
influential spiritual leader in Zabol Province as well as in 
whole Afghanistan. He helped secure the release of six Chinese 
engineers who were also kidnapped to Afghanistan in 1992. 
  Hamed Gilani said their efforts to set free the Chinese and 
Pakistani hostages are based on "humanitarian value and moral 
obligation" as well as "private request from the family of the 
kidnapped deputy commissioner". 
  It has nothing to do with Pakistan Government, he said.

<F P=106> ["International Forum" column by Gu Ping (0657 1627): "Evil </F>
Intentions"] 
  [Text] Britain's news media have recently fabricated two 
news pieces to slander South Africa and China. On 15 May, THE 
SUNDAY TIMES carried a special dispatch which said that Nelson 
Mandela, who has just been elected president, will "resign from 
the post of president of South Africa within two years," and 
that this would "cause a power struggle within the African 
National Congress." The next morning, the BBC broadcast a 
so-called documentary which had carefully pulled together 
various pieces to claim that "China has 10 million prisoners in 
labor camps, who are in a hopeless situation." When these rumors 
came out, they were immediately refuted solemnly and forcefully 
by Mandela himself and by a spokesman from our country's Foreign 
Ministry. 
  On the same day THE SUNDAY TIMES carried its strange report, 
Mandela issued a statement which said "that the article is 
totally groundless and is sheer rumor, its purpose is to create 
instability in the first democratically elected government." On 
17 May, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman listed facts to 
point out that the allegations by the BBC were "sheer 
fabrications." 
  It is not a coincidence that these two British news agencies 
one after the other resorted to this kind of trick to slander 
South Africa and China; it is a natural revelation of the dark 
side in the minds of a small minority of Britons who hate to see 
advancement in the world. South Africa, which was once under 
British colonial rule, has got rid of numerous obstacles, cast 
off the chains of racism, obtained a new life, and embarked upon 
a road of national reconciliation and peaceful and stable 
development of the country; China, implementing the policy of 
reform and opening up, enjoys economic prosperity, social 
stability, and national unity, and is firmly fulfilling the 
historic mission of resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong. Some 
people in Britain do not want to see any of these things, but 
they have no alternative, and although they have tried something 
which overrates their strength, these moves resemble a mantis 
trying to stop a chariot. Therefore, they have used disgraceful 
means and did not hesitate to create materials and spread rumors 
in an attempt to cheat the world and create trouble for the 
countries to which they are hostile in order to find pretexts to 
interfere in their internal affairs. 
  The BBC and THE SUNDAY TIMES always claim that they are 
"objective and just" in their reporting. But facts prove that 
they say something in one way and do something another way, and 
even play a disgraceful role in fabricating rumors to mislead 
people. Regarding this, I do not know what kind of explanation 
they have to offer to the British public and international 
public opinion circles.

  [Text] Brussels, May 18 (XINHUA) -- The European Union (EU) 
should abolish trade restrictions on China, urged Li Ruihuan, 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). 
  Li made the call when meeting here today with Willy Claes, 
Belgian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, 
on Sino-European and Belgian relations. 
  The European Union (EU) still has some restrictions on 
Sino-European relations which is incompatible with present 
needs, Li said, these restrictions should be abolished. 
  Li expressed Chinese belief that Sino-European relations 
would develop smoothly if the two sides carry out the principles 
of seeking common ground while reserving differences, 
respecting, non-interference of each other's internal affairs 
and peaceful mutual benefit. 
  Showing his understanding on Li's viewpoint, Claes said that 
the EU should adopt a positive attitude towards China, relaxing 
its restrictions to China on trade and economy and opening to 
the country. 
  Li also said that the Chinese Government attaches importance 
in developing long-standing, equal and mutually beneficial 
relations with West European countries and that those relations 
are good on the whole. 
  He stressed that both sides share the same or similar views 
on essential international affairs, the economic base for 
cooperation is concrete and the future for development is 
tremendous. 
  Chairman Li said that Sino-Belgian trade and economic 
relations have been increasing in recent years. 
  The healthy and fast pace of China's national economy with 
its big market and advanced technology, equipment and funds from 
Belgium offers great cooperation potential and a bright future 
for trade and economic cooperation of the two countries, he 
added. 
  Li expressed China's willingness in making joint efforts 
with 
Belgian parties to promote mutually-beneficial cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  Claes said the trade and economic cooperation between 
Belgium 
and China are satisfactory and Belgium has a strong wish to 
develop more relations with China. 
  He added, Belgium will take new measures to expand trade and 
economic exchanges with the country and I believe the chairman's 
visit will influence positively the understanding and 
cooperations between Belgium and China. 
  Freddy Thilemans, the mayor of Brussels, hosted a welcome 
ceremony this afternoon for Chairman Li, who is on the last leg 
of a five-nation European tour, which has already taken him to 
Finland, Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

  [Text] Brussels, 18 May (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], met here today with Willy 
Claes, Belgian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs. They exchanged views on the development of 
Sino-Belgian relations and China's relations with West European 
countries. 
  Li Ruihuan said: A good development momentum has appeared in 
Sino-Belgian trade and economic relations in recent years. A 
vast market provided by China's national economy with sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development and advanced technology, 
equipment, and funds from Belgium offer great potential and 
broad prospects for trade and economic cooperation between the 
two countries. China is willing to make joint efforts with 
Belgium to further develop the mutually beneficial cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  On relations between China and Western Europe, Li Ruihuan 
said: The Chinese Government attaches importance to developing 
long-term, stable, equal, mutually beneficial, and cooperative 
relations with West European countries. These relations are 
good on the whole. Both sides share the same or similar views on 
major international issues. Economically, the two sides have a 
sound foundation for cooperation and broad prospects for 
development. Since last year, the relations between the two 
sides have noticeably improved and developed; the exchange of 
visits by high-level personnel has increased and yielded 
positive results; and trade and economic cooperation have 
steadily developed. Strengthening cooperation between China and 
West European countries in various fields is conducive not only 
to both sides but to the peace, stability, and economic 
development of the world. Of course, there are some problems in 
the relations between China and West European countries as well 
as some restrictions imposed by the European Union in its 
relations with China. Such restrictions are incompatible with 
the times and should be abolished. Li Ruihuan then pointed out: 
Mutual relations can develop smoothly provided the two sides 
abide by the principles of seeking common ground while reserving 
differences, mutual respect, noninterference in each other's 
internal affairs, peace, and mutual benefit. 
  Showing his understanding of Li Ruihuan's viewpoint, Deputy 
Prime Minister Claes said: The European Union should take a 
positive attitude toward China by relaxing its restrictions on 
China in trade and economic affairs and opening to the country. 
Claes said: The development of trade and economic cooperation 
between Belgium and China is satisfactory. With a strong wish 
to develop relations with China, Belgium is willing to take 
measures to further expand trade and economic exchanges between 
the two countries. He then expressed the belief that Chairman 
Li Ruihuan's visit would help enhance mutual understanding and 
cooperation.

  [Text] Brussels, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China hopes to develop 
long-term and stable cooperative relations with other countries 
and learn from their strong points, a senior Chinese official 
said here today. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, said this while 
meeting with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene here. 
  The two leaders praised the successful cooperation between 
China and Belgium in economy and trade and hoped for a long-term 
and stable development of their friendly ties. 
  Li said that his Europe tour sought to learn from other 
states their experiences which will benefit China. China's 
cooperation with the outside world would promote both its own 
modernization and global peace and development as well, he added. 
  He said China was far behind the Western countries in 
economy 
and science as it had to spend time and energy over the past 
century winning national liberation from the imperialist 
aggression. 
  Starting to open itself to the world and the international 
market in the 1980s, he said, China had been drawing on the 
experiences of other countries, accelerating its development and 
contributing to the international community. 
  The Belgian prime minister, meanwhile, hailed the friendship 
between the two countries, noting that the exchange of 
high-level visits had increased in recent years and Belgium had 
made more and more investment in China. 
  He predicted that China's rapid economic growth would have a 
significant influence upon Asia. 
  Dehaene added that his country pays great attention to and 
appreciates China's constructive role in the United Nations 
Security Council. 
  He also expressed confidence that Li's visit would promote 
Sino- Belgian ties in the political and economic fields. 
  The Chinese official arrived here Tuesday [17 May] for a 
five- day visit to Belgium, the last leg of his 
five-European-nation tour.

leader stressed here today that China is willing to make joint 
efforts with Belgium to push forward trade and economic 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the 
Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, made these remarks 
while meeting with Belgian Minister of External Trade Robert 
Urbain. 
  Li said that Sino-Belgian trade and economic relations have 
been developed smoothly in recent years, and that the economies 
of the two countries are mutually supplementary, thus offering 
great potential and a bright future for trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  Li expressed China's willingness to make joint efforts with 
Belgium to push bilateral cooperation to a new stage, 
  Urbain said he has been deeply impressed by the remarkable 
economic achievements in China. He also expressed his 
appreciation for the realistic and prudent policies of the 
Chinese government in developing the country's economy. 
  Belgium puts great emphasis on its economic relationship 
with 
China and is willing to enhance friendly cooperation, Urbain 
said, adding that he believes Li's visit will lead to the 
further development of trade and economic cooperation. 
  In the evening, the Chinese leader attended a welcoming 
banquet held jointly by the Federation of Belgian Enterprises 
and the Belgium-China Economic and Trade Confederation. 
  Li told the guests that Belgium has become China's sixth 
largest trading partner, and that the joint-ventures with 
Belgian investment have introduced many advanced technologies 
into China. China welcome more investments from Belgium, he 
added. 
  Also speaking at the banquet, Georges Jacobs, president of 
the Federation of Belgian Enterprises, said China is now at the 
world's center stage in development, and China's rapid growth 
has paved the way for the further development of bilateral 
cooperation. 
  With growing interest in China, Belgium now wishes to 
enhance 
economic ties, Jacobs added. 
  Li Ruihuan is on the last leg of a five-nation European 
tour, 
which has already taken him to Finland, Sweden, Norway and 
Denmark.

Beijing newspapers and stations] 
  [Text] Paris, 12 May (XINHUA) -- Bosson, French minister 
of equipment, transport, and tourism, met with visiting Beijing 
Mayor Li Qiyan in Paris on 12 May. The two sides had a warm 
conversation on further expanding friendship and cooperation 
between China and France and between Beijing and Paris. 
  Bosson first extended welcome to Li Qiyan in the wake of the 
restoration of traditional French-Chinese friendship. He said: 
The French Government attaches great importance to developing 
friendship and cooperation with China. "The green light given 
by China for France to take part in competitions in China on an 
equal footing" has opened up broad prospects for expanded trade 
and economic cooperation between the two nations. France will 
take advantage of its strong points in such high-tech sectors as 
industry, communications, transportation, subway, high-speed 
train, and telecommunications in actively expanding such 
cooperation. 
  Li Qiyan briefed Bosson on the tremendous changes under way 
in Beijing as a result of the policy of reform and opening up. 
He said: The Beijing City Government will make full use of 
this opportunity brought about by the robust economic 
development in promoting cooperation with foreign countries. He 
emphasized that Beijing and Paris are economically mutually 
complementary to a great extent. There is great potential for 
the development of trade and economic cooperation. It is hoped 
that Beijing and Paris will make active efforts in developing 
and implementing various cooperation projects so that the 
friendship between the two nations will be constantly reinforced 
by solid progress in trade and economic cooperation. He 
believed that such cooperation is in keeping with the 
fundamental interests of Chinese and French people and is 
conducive to the cause of world peace and progress. 
  At the invitation of Jiluo [name as received], chairman of 
the assembly of the Great Paris Area, Mayor Li Qiyan arrived in 
Paris on the evening of 11 May for an official goodwill visit. 
During his stay, he will meet leaders of the Paris assembly and 
French business quarters.

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin and his Surinamese counterpart Ronald R. Venetiaan today 
agreed to further mutually beneficial cooperation between the 
two countries. 
  During a two-hour talk at the state guesthouse here this 
afternoon, Jiang said that both China and Suriname -- which lies 
on the north coast of South America -- are developing countries, 
shared similar sufferings in the past and have a solid basis for 
future friendly cooperation. 
  Jiang said that under the leadership of the Surinamese 
president, the Surinamese people have made unremitting efforts 
to safeguard their domestic political stability and boost their 
national economy. 
  In regional affairs, he said, in recent years Suriname has 
been actively involved in promoting the progress of Caribbean 
integration and playing an important role in promoting regional 
stability and development. "The Chinese Government appreciates 
this." 
  Jiang said the establishment of a peaceful, stable, fair and 
reasonable international political and economic new order is an 
urgent demand of the world community, especially of the 
developing countries. 
  He noted that the developing countries are longing for peace 
and state development and progress. The developing countries 
making up a large proportion of the world were the main forces 
for maintaining world peace, he said. 
  Venetiaan, after reviewing the traditional friendship 
between 
the two peoples, expressed his appreciation of the rapid 
development of China's economy and his desire for strengthening 
bilateral economic ties and trade. 
  He said that to enhance bilateral cooperation in every field 
conformed to the interests of the two peoples, and Suriname was 
willing to do so, he said. 
  Referring to the Caribbean regional situation, Jiang gave a 
high appraisal of the roles of the countries in this region, 
saying that the Caribbean region is an important component part 
of the Third World and also a "bridge" linking the south and the 
north of America. 
  Over the past few years, he said, remarkable achievements 
have been made by the Caribbean countries in promoting the 
regional peace and stability and pushing forward economic 
cooperation. 
  Jiang said: "What we appreciate is that the Caribbean 
countries are united and positively promote the progress of 
Caribbean integration." 
  He said China is concerned about the development of the 
Caribbean regional situation and desires to strengthen its 
friendly ties and cooperation with the Caribbean countries, 
contributing to safeguarding world peace and development. 
  Venetiaan said Suriname, as part of America and the 
Caribbean, and a non-aligned country and member of the United 
Nations, stands for Caribbean integration and non-alignment, for 
safeguarding state sovereignty and the principles of equality 
and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and 
also for the principles of peaceful co-existence between the 
nations and solving international conflicts through negotiation. 
  Venetiaan reaffirmed the "one-China" policy. Jiang expressed 
his appreciation of this. 
  Wang Zhibao, chairman of the Chinese Government Reception 
Committee and vice-minister of forestry, and Liu Huaqiu, 
vice-minister of foreign affairs, participated in the talks. 
  Also present were S.Ch. Mungra, minister of foreign affairs, 
F.R. Demon, minister of natural resources and energy, and J. 
Sisal, minister of agriculture and fisheries, who are 
accompanying the Surinamese president on his China visit. 
  Following the talks, the two presidents attended the signing 
of four cooperative documents between the two countries. 
  They were: a loan agreement between the two governments; a 
document detailing that the Chinese Government will present the 
Surinamese Government with goods; a document detailing that 
China has agreed to extend the repayment period for loans given 
to Suriname; and a contract for China to provide agricultural 
machinery and tools to Suriname. 
  This afternoon, Jiang hosted a ceremony to welcome Venetiaan 
and his wife and their party. Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of 
China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, attended 
the ceremony. 
  Jiang gave a banquet here this evening in honor of the 
president and his entourage, who arrived here at noon today on a 
state visit.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Chen Muhua, 
vice-chairwoman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) 
Standing Committee, said here today that the NPC intends to 
enhance its ties with the Surinamese National Assembly so as to 
promote the all-round growth of bilateral cooperation. 
  She made these remarks while calling on visiting Surinamese 
President Ronald R. Venetiaan at the state guesthouse here this 
afternoon. 
  Suriname lies on the north coast of South America, and Chen 
noted that China and Suriname are far apart geographically and 
differ in national conditions, but they are both developing 
countries, facing common tasks of developing their economies and 
raising their people's living standards. 
  The two countries have shared identical or similar views on 
many international issues, she added. 
  During the meeting Chen reviewed with pleasure her trip to 
Suriname last July, saying that she was deeply impressed by the 
visit. 
  Venetiaan said his visit was short, but he had witnessed a 
prosperous and stable China. 
  He said he very much admired the rapid development of 
China's 
economy under the condition of a stable society, due to the 
Chinese leaders' correct strategic ideology. 
  Earlier, when interviewed by Chinese journalists, Venetiaan 
described his China visit as "very important for Suriname". 
  He said that during the visit he has been discussing with 
Chinese leaders the situation of the two countries. His visit 
to China has enabled the friendship between the two countries to 
"become effective", he said. 
  On the future of bilateral ties, Venetiaan said that the 
prospects for the relations between the two countries, economic 
cooperation and trade in particular, "are very good". 
  He noted that Suriname is a country with a small population. 
But, he added, it has a reasonable amount of natural resources. 
  Suriname has possibilities for development, he said, adding, 
it is possible for the two countries to discuss how to use 
Suriname's high proportion of forest coverage. 
  "I think there is possibility for the two countries to 
cooperate" in this regard, he said. 
  On the question of Suriname's joining the Caribbean 
Community, Venetiaan said political and economic integration in 
the Caribbean region would benefit every country of this region. 
  Suriname is looking forward to joining the Caribbean 
Community in July this year, he said. It is now an observer of 
the organization.

<F P=106> [Report: "Speech By Comrade Hu Jintao at Meeting To </F>
Commemorate 30th Anniversary of the Death of Comrade Jiao Yulu 
(13 May 1994)"] 
  [Text] Comrades: 
  Today, the Henan Provincial CPC Committee has convened a 
grand meeting to mark the 30th anniversary of the death of 
Comrade Jiao Yulu. Entrusted by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, 
I have come to the meeting and, on behalf of the CPC Central 
Committee, to deeply cherish the memory of Comrade Jiao Yulu, to 
extend heartfelt regards to relatives of Comrade Jiao Yulu, and 
to express high consideration for fine Communist Party members, 
fine cadres, and other advanced individuals who have emerged in 
the great practice of reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization and who have carried forward the spirit of Jiao 
Yulu. 
  Comrade Jiao Yulu was a good member of the CPC, a good 
public 
servant of the people, and a good example for county secretaries 
and the broad masses of cadres. This is acknowledged by all 
party comrades and the people of all nationalities throughout 
the country. He dedicated all his life to the cause of the party 
and the interests of the people. In the early 1960's, Comrade 
Jiao Yulu was secretary of the Lankao County CPC Committee. In 
order to change the poverty-stricken situation in areas 
afflicted by natural disasters in Lankao, despite illness, he 
led the people of the whole county in fighting stubbornly 
against serious natural disasters. He went deep into the 
reality and the grass-roots level to seriously conduct 
investigation, to listen to the demands of the people, to 
concern himself with their plight, to earnestly help them 
overcome difficulties, and to bring the warmth of the party to 
tens of thousands of households. He devoted himself to his 
work, worked diligently, performed official duties honestly, 
carried out arduous struggle, always linked his heart with those 
of the people, and maintained the fine quality of a Communist. 
At the last moment of his life, he was still thinking of how to 
help the people live a happy and prosperous life and how to make 
the country grow and flourish. Comrade Jiao Yulu consciously 
linked the lofty ideal of the realization of communism with the 
arduous struggle carried out in a down-to-earth manner in the 
present stage, made selfless contributions, did his utmost to 
explore, served the people wholeheartedly, and depended entirely 
on the people. Through his own actions, he portrayed the 
shining image of an outstanding member and cadre of the 
Communist Party and erected a towering monument in the hearts of 
the people. For the past 30 years, his moving deeds have 
educated and inspired thousands upon thousands of party members, 
cadres, and ordinary people to constantly move forward. His 
great spirit will always shine with dazzling splendor in the 
progress of historical development. 
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
party's basic line, China has made spectacular achievements in 
reform, opening up, and modernization which have attracted 
worldwide attention and the face of the whole country has 
undergone profound change. The tasks we are shouldering today 
are different from those when Comrade Jiao Yulu was alive. The 
social environment, working conditions, and people's ideology 
and concepts have also changed greatly. While taking economic 
construction as the center, building socialist material and 
spiritual civilization, and promoting another leap in society 
and history, all party comrades and all the people of the 
country are constantly making progress themselves. The spirit 
of the time, which includes emancipating the mind, seeking truth 
from facts, energetically making exploration, boldly blazing new 
trails, carrying out arduous struggle, advancing despite 
difficulties, learning from foreign countries, making 
unremitting efforts to improve oneself, being modest and 
prudent, guarding against arrogance and rashness, being of one 
heart and one mind, taking the overall situation into 
consideration, practicing economy, being honest, rousing oneself 
to make the country prosperous, and making selfless 
contribution, have all been further developed. At the same 
time, we must also be aware that ideas and styles of money 
worship which "puts money above everything else," hedonism which 
advocates seeking ease and comfort, and blatant egotism which 
places individual interests in first place, have also grown and 
spread among some of the people. Under these circumstances, no 
matter whether or not we are trying to carry forward the spirit 
of the times or to resist the influence of various negative and 
decadent ideas, it is all the more necessary for us to adhere to 
the party's purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people, to 
inherit and carry forward the fine style of establishing close 
ties with the masses of people and of doing arduous pioneering 
work, and to advocate through great efforts the spirit of Jiao 
Yulu. It can be said that today, seriously learning from and 
carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu remains as the demand 
of our great era, the call by the people of all nationalities 
throughout the whole country, and the need in strengthening 
party building and developing socialist modernization. 
  The goal of our present stage is to build socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. The general task for the whole party 
and the whole country at present is to seize the opportunity to 
deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote 
development, and maintain stability. In learning from and 
carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu in the new period, we 
should have our feet firmly planted in the present, have our 
eyes on the future, and integrate the lofty ideal of realizing 
communism with carrying out socialist modernization in a 
down-to-earth manner. The fundamental objective of carrying out 
reform and opening up, and of establishing the socialist market 
economy structure, is to liberate and develop the social 
productive forces, to strengthen the comprehensive national 
strength of our socialist country, to improve the living 
standards of the people, and eventually to realize common 
prosperity. As a genuine Communist Party member, one should 
firmly establish the correct ideal, faith, and outlook on life, 
unswervingly carry out the party's basic line of "one center, 
two basic points," increase one's sense of responsibility and 
mission in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and 
give expression to one's value of life in the course of 
endeavoring to make greater contributions to reform, opening up, 
and modernization. 
  In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao 
Yulu 
in the new period, we should, as did Jiao Yulu, serve the people 
wholeheartedly, establish close ties with the people, do 
everything for the people, and trust and rely on the people in 
all matters. Comrade Jiao Yulu "had everyone on his mind except 
himself." What he thought or did was precisely what the broad 
masses of people needed most and what he criticized and opposed, 
was precisely what the broad masses of people detested and 
hated. He always "appeared in front of the people when they 
were in difficulty and showed concern for and helped the people 
when they needed help most." This is the fundamental reason why 
Jiao Yulu enjoys such a high prestige in the minds of the people. 
  The reform, opening up, and socialist modernization we are 
engaged in at present are a brand-new cause in human history and 
are also the people 's own cause. In the course of advance, we 
will inevitably encounter many new situations and new problems 
and only by relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses of 
people can the problems be solved. In particular, in the 
current process of deepening reform, some deep contradictions 
will gradually become conspicuous and some people will meet with 
some new difficulties in production and daily life. Therefore, 
we should study these problems and find solutions to them 
together with the masses of people in a serious and responsible 
manner. Leading cadres at all levels must further strengthen 
their mass viewpoint, adhere to the mass line, safeguard the 
fundamental interests of the people, go among the people to find 
out their weal and woe, listen to their demands, strive to solve 
problems and overcome difficulties about which the people are 
concerned, and properly handle various contradictions among the 
people. The masses of people are the source of our party's 
strength and the basis of the victory of our cause. All party 
comrades should firmly strike roots among the people and serve 
the people well. With the trust and support of the people, the 
victory of our cause is guaranteed. 
  In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao 
Yulu 
in the new period we should, as did Jiao Yulu, adhere to the 
party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts, proceed 
from reality in everything we do, speak the truth, do solid 
work, explore boldly, and work creatively. Comrade Jiao Yulu 
went deep into reality, carried out investigations and studies, 
respected the practice of the people, proceeded from the reality 
of Lankao, made and implemented the correct policy decision on 
putting the "three disasters" under control, and made important 
contributions to changing the face of Lankao. He seriously 
implemented the decisions made at higher levels and paid 
attention to implementing them in light of local reality. He 
was fond of reading and studying but he did not blindly follow 
what the books said. He paid attention to studying other 
people's experiences but he never used such experience 
mechanically. This is also an important reason why Jiao Yulu 
was able to work with so well and why he enjoyed popular 
support. Today, if we want to seize the opportunity to develop 
ourselves and to push forward the cause of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, we must pay greater attention to 
grasping the essence of Marxism in emancipating the mind and 
seeking truth from facts, study hard, master a scientific world 
outlook and methodology, uphold the principle of putting 
practice first, respect the objective laws of the development of 
things, comprehensively understand and implement the party's 
line, policies, principles, and various reform measures, 
correctly understand and handle contradictions and problems with 
which we are faced, guard against one-sidedness and avoid 
thinking in terms of absolutes, and reduce subjectivism and 
blindness. Regarding new problems we face, it is all the more 
necessary for us to study them with utmost care, energetically 
solve them, boldly explore them, creatively work on them, and to 
constantly raise our leadership level and develop our work 
ability. 
  In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao 
Yulu in the new period we should, like Jiao Yulu, fear no 
hardships and dangers, fight with fortitude, and do arduous 
pioneering work. Waging arduous struggle and making unremitting 
efforts to improve oneself are fine traditions of our party and 
the Chinese nation. These fine traditions were fully manifested 
by Jiao Yulu. When Lankao was hard hit by serious natural 
disasters, Jiao Yulu, in the dauntless and heroic spirit of a 
Communist, pressed forward in the face of difficulties, dared to 
"pose as hero before difficulties," and aroused the 
determination and fighting will of the people to triumph over 
difficulties through his own deeds. Ours is a great cause which 
is full of hope and also strewn with hardship. A great cause 
needs a great spirit. Waging arduous struggle is a kind of 
noble moral integrity and also provides a tremendous strength 
for cutting through brambles and thorns, blazing new trails, and 
for forging ahead. In the course of reform and construction, 
especially when we encounter difficulties, it is even more 
necessary for us to carry forward the spirit of waging arduous 
struggle. As Communist Party members, we should not fear 
hardships or dangers and should never recoil with fear and 
accomplish nothing. We should make unremitting efforts to 
improve ourselves, do pioneering work, and forge ahead, and 
should never stick to old ways and cease to make progress. We 
should practice economy and treasure the wealth created by the 
people and we should never indulge in ostentation or competition 
in spending, extravagance, and waste. 
  In learning from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao 
Yulu, we should perform official duties honestly and work 
diligently for the people. Jiao Yulu did not go to Lankao to 
become an official. He went there to work for the people's 
interests. To date, the people still talk extensively about how 
he performed his official duties honestly and exercised 
self-discipline. "The history of the country and of all the 
great men in the past shows that diligence and thrift lead to 
success but extravagance leads to failure." We should remember 
this old saying. Party and government cadres, leading cadres in 
particular, at all levels must follow the example of Jiao Yulu, 
consciously temper themselves to strengthen their party 
characteristics, always put the party's cause in an important 
position, and set high demands on themselves. They should 
correctly use the power given them by the people, work hard, 
strive to do solid work to benefit the people, resolutely fight 
against phenomena of corruption, and live up to the hopes of the 
broad masses of people. 
  Comrade Jiao Yulu is a brilliant example for our broad 
masses 
of party members, leading cadres at all levels in particular. 
Party committees at all levels should regard learning from and 
carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu as an important measure 
to strengthen the building of the ideology and work styles of 
party and state power organs, to strengthen the building of the 
socialist spiritual civilization, and to promote reform, opening 
up, and socialist modernization in China. They should: 
Continue to do a good job and make achievements in this 
respect; further enhance the formation of a public opinion 
environment for developing healthy trends, suppressing unhealthy 
trends, and encouraging people to make progress; and should 
promote the more extensive and thorough development of 
activities to learn from Jiao Yulu. They should link learning 
from and carrying forward the spirit of Jiao Yulu with the 
implementation of the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, with the study of the Volume 3 of The Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping and with safeguarding and promoting 
the overall situation of reform, development, and stability. In 
the course of doing so, they should strive to train and nurture 
thousands upon thousands of good party members and good cadres 
like Jiao Yulu. In activities to learn from Jiao Yulu, leading 
cadres at all levels should take the lead in setting examples 
through their own actions, comprehensively improve their own 
quality, lead the broad masses of cadres and people in plunging 
themselves into the practice of seizing the opportunity to 
deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote 
development, maintain stability, and make new achievements in 
and greater contributions to the great cause of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics!

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (AFP)--Chinese movie-maker Yin Li 
confirmed Friday he had been blocked from travelling to the 
Cannes Film Festival by the Chinese authorities, in a protest at 
the screening of "To Live," a film by a fellow director that had 
not received Beijing's official approval. 
  Yin, speaking by telephone, said he had been advised of the 
decision on Thursday, three days ahead of the screening of his 
own film, "The History of Xinghua," in the French Mediterranean 
resort. 
  "The producers and the two leading actors of my film were 
also informed that their exit visas from China had been 
refused," he said. 
  Yin, 36, said he felt victimised by a decision that had 
affected another film-maker, Zhang Yimou, who made "To Live." 
  "He's the one who's sick, and I'm the one getting the 
treatment," he said. 
  The bar on Yin, which was initially reported in Cannes 
Thursday, came after Zhang announced that he would not attend 
the Cannes premiere of "To Live." 
  "Because my film ... has still not received its censors' 
visa 
in China, I am unable to come to the Cannes festival. I regret 
this very much," a statement released by Zhang in Cannes said. 
  Zhang is director of the 1991 hit "Raise the Red Lantern." 
  "To Live" tells the story of three generations of a family

<F P=106> [By reporters Yuan Wenzhong (5913 2429 1813) and Huang </F>
Qiusheng (7806 4428 3932)] 
  [Text] Jinan, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- With the approval of the 
State Council and the Central Military Commission, the 1994 
National Work Meeting on the Placement of Demobilized Army 
Officers was held in Jinan today. It was put forward at the 
meeting that the work of placing demobilized Army officers 
should be carried out as a political task and that great efforts 
should be made to improve such work under the conditions of the 
market economy. 
  President Jiang Zemin, who is also general secretary of the 
CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, and State Council Premier Li Peng sent 
congratulatory messages (the full texts of which will be 
transmitted separately) to the meeting. State Councillor Li 
Guixian; Song Defu, head of the Work Group for the Placement of 
Demobilized Army Officers and minister of the Ministry of 
Personnel; Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission 
and director of the General Political Department; and others 
attended and spoke at the meeting. 
  In his work report, Song Defu said: We achieved new progress 
in the work of placing demobilized Army officers in 1993 because 
we paid attention to the study of the new situation in this 
aspect. A total of 58,000 demobilized Army officers and 25,000 
dependents of these officers were properly placed in 1993. This 
is an achievement which has played an active role in reducing 
the Army, strengthening the building up of the contingent of 
cadres, and promoting the modernization drive. In this year, 
nearly 50,000 Army (including armed police) cadres will be 
placed at work in localities. The State Council and the Central 
Military Commission urged governments and military leaders at 
all levels to pay great attention to this work. In light of the 
overall interest of reform, development, and stability, they 
should persist in carrying out the placement work as an 
important political task. They should work hard to implement 
the current placement policy, which is supposed to be stable and 
continuous. Meanwhile, the placement work should gradually be 
integrated with the establishment of a socialist market economy 
as well as the reform of a personnel system and Army cadre 
system. As for this year's placement work, we should continue 
to carry out the policy of placing demobilized Army officers in 
their home towns or the places where they were originally 
conscripted. In addition, we can place needed personnel in the 
state's key construction projects and new industries. We should 
focus on the placement of demobilized cadres at the division and 
regimental levels. It is necessary to try every way to solve 
problems concerning placing these cadres and their families. 
  In his speech, Yu Yongbo said: The congratulatory messages 
sent by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng not 
only point out the right way for this year's work of placing 
demobilized Army officers but also show that the CPC Central 
Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military 
Commission pay great attention to Army building and their great 
concerns about the work of placing demobilized cadres. He 
mentioned three points for carrying out this year's work: 
First, it is necessary to conscientiously be subject to and 
serve the overall interest of this year's work put forward by 
the party and the state and further enhance the sense of 
responsibility in carrying out this work. Second, the key to 
placing demobilized Army officers lies in carrying out relevant 
policies and regulations. Third, it is necessary to do 
intensive ideological and political work to encourage 
demobilized cadres to make contributions in their new jobs. 
  Li Guixian spoke at the meeting on how to carry out this 
year's work of placing demobilized Army officers. He said: The 
work of placing demobilized Army officers is an important matter 
which has a great bearing on the state's reform, development, 
and stability as well as on Army building. Demobilized Army 
officers are the precious property of the party and the state 
because they are an importance force in the socialist 
modernization drive. He urged party committees and governments 
at all levels to unify their thinking, take the overall interest 
into consideration, and conscientiously carry out the principle 
of serving the cause of military and economic construction. He 
said that they should give demobilized Army officers a warm 
welcome, properly arrange a job for them, train them earnestly, 
and use them reasonably. 
  Also attending the meeting were leaders of Shandong Province 
and the Jinan Military Region, as well as responsible persons of 
all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, cities with 
provincial-level decision-making authority, central state 
organs, the People's Liberation Army, and the armed police.

Jianxin (1728 1696 2450) and Cen Daokun (1478 6670 0981)] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 27 April, the Lanzhou Military 
Region ceremoniously held a meeting at the 1 August Club to 
confer the honorable title of "Model Company in Grass-Roots 
Construction" on the Fourth Company of a certain regiment. 
  Zhou Yongshun, deputy political commissar of the Xinjiang 
Military District, chaired the meeting. 
  Fu Bingyue, deputy commander of the Lanzhou Military Region 
and commander of the Xinjiang Military District, read the 
Lanzhou Military Region's order that conferred the title of 
"Model Company in Grass-Roots Construction" on the Fourth 
Company of the certain regiment. 
  The Fourth Company of the certain regiment, established 
during the war of resistance against Japan, is a military unit 
with a glorious history and fine traditions. During the 
competition of military techniques held by the Xinjiang Military 
District in 1964, it won gold medals in contests of all the five 
major military techniques at evening training sessions, 
including a 100-percent mark for outstanding shooting 
performance at night. It was known as the "Nocturnal Tiger 
Company." Under a new historic period, it has carried forward 
our army's glorious traditions; has earnestly implemented 
President Jiang Zemin's general requirements that "all army 
units must be qualified politically and competent militarily. 
They must have a fine style of work, maintain strict discipline 
and be assured of adequate logistical support"; has 
conscientiously pursued the "Program on Developing Military 
Grass-Roots Units"; and has accomplished remarkable results in 
building the company in an all-around manner. In the past six 
consecutive years since 1988, the company has been commended as 
an advanced unit and advanced company that fulfilled its 
requirements; and has won a collective's third-class meritorious 
award in the past consecutive six years and a collective's 
second-class meritorious award in one year. In 1992, the 
Xinjiang Military District named the company as a "Pacesetting 
Company in Grass-Roots Construction." 
  Pan Zhaomin, deputy political commissar of the Lanzhou 
Military Region and political commissar of the Xinjiang Military 
District, attended and spoke at the meeting. He urged all 
Xinjiang military units to launch extensive campaigns to 
comprehensively learn from the Fourth Company so that more 
heroic collectives similar to the Fourth Company will appear in 
Xinjiang's military units. 
  At the meeting, Fang Denghua, deputy commander of the 
Xinjiang Military District, read the Xinjiang Military District 
party committee's "decision on launching campaigns to learn from 
the `Model Company in Grass-Roots Construction'."

program: "Always Keep the Masses in Mind"] 
  [Text] Yao Liejue [political commissar of an engineering 
regiment under the 2d Artillery Corps of the People's Liberation 
Army, PLA, who was commended for having refused gifts], as a 
leading cadre, enjoys the support of officers and men because he 
bears firmly in mind what fighters asked him to do: Always keep 
the masses in mind. 
  The basic purpose of our party is to serve the people 
wholeheartedly. It is all the more important for leading cadres 
to firmly foster a concept of identifying oneself with the 
masses. 
  Reform and economic development require us to emancipate our 
minds and adopt new ideas. But this does not in the least mean 
that the concept of doing everything possible for the people can 
be allowed to become diluted. 
  Yao Liejue's deeds show us: In the final analysis, whether a 
leading cadre can be honest and upright is a question of how to 
treat the masses. A leader's power is given by the people, and 
all the money and materials in his charge are the people's 
property which is created by them through hard toil. A leader 
who always keeps the masses in mind will never abuse the power 
given by them to appropriate their property. 
  As reform deepens, our leaders at all levels should care for 
and cherish the masses all the more, help them surmount various 
practical difficulties, and share the same fate and breathe the 
same air with the masses.

<F P=106> [By Li Jianxing (2621 1696 5281): "China's State-Owned </F>
Assets Exceed 3,000 Billion Yuan by End of 1992"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (RENMIN RIBAO)--The gross quantity 
of state assets in our country has increased rapidly in recent 
years, and they have also yielded better economic returns. 
According to statistics from the State Bureau for Management of 
State-Owned Assets, by the end of 1992, the gross book value of 
state assets in our country reached 3,069.7 billion yuan (not 
including resource-like assets and state assets held by the 
Armed Forces and the armed police force), and increased they had 
by 14.3 percent or 385.1 billion yuan over the previous year's 
figure of 2,684.6 billion yuan. 
  State assets managed by central institutions were worth 
1,458.4 billion yuan and accounted for 47.5 percent of the 
total, with state assets managed by localities worth 1,611.3 
billion yuan, accounting for 52.5 percent. In terms of use, 
state assets used in economic operations were worth 2,210.1 
billion yuan and accounted for 72 percent, while state assets 
not involved in economic operations were worth 859.6 billion 
yuan and accounted for 28 percent. State assets involved in 
economic operations increased by 13.1 percent, or 256.5 billion 
yuan, over the previous year. 
  Regarding the distribution of state assets in various 
trades, 
at the end of 1992, state assets in state-owned industrial 
enterprises throughout the country were worth 1,649.8 billion 
yuan. State-owned enterprises accounted for over 90 percent of 
all assets in such important industries as energy, 
transportation, mining, high technology, banking, and foreign 
trade industries. The gross quantity of state assets in the 
manufacturing industry, the construction and engineering 
industry, and agriculture, forestry, and water resources 
industries increased at a rate 10 percentage points higher than 
the national average growth rate. Assets in the real estate 
industry and enterprises adopting the joint-stock system 
increased at the highest rate. At the end of 1992, state assets 
in the real estate industry were worth 90.5 billion yuan, an 
increase of 69.8 percent over the previous year, and the gross 
quantity of state assets in enterprises that have adopted the 
joint-stock system reached 28.4 billion yuan, or an increase of 
175.7 percent over the previous year. The state-owned economy 
as a whole grew continuously and became the predominant force in 
the national economy [sentence as published]. 
  Through in-depth reform and expanded opening, state-owned 
enterprises continuously increased their dynamism and improved 
their economic results. 
  By the end of 1992, tax and profit contributions by 
state-owned enterprises throughout the country amounted to 329.1 
billion yuan, increasing by 45.3 billion yuan or 16 percent over 
the previous year. They earned 117.6 billion yuan of profits, 
an increase of 11.3 percent or 11.9 billion yuan over the 
previous year. Enterprises incurring losses accounted for 24.3 
percent of the total number of state-owned enterprises, down 7.3 
percentage points from the previous year's level of 31.6 
percent. The proportion of business losses in economic results 
declined to 26.7 percent from 32.1 percent in the previous year. 
Tax and profit contributions made by state-owned enterprises 
accounted for about two-thirds of the state's fiscal revenues.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (CNS) -- According to a research 
report recently published by the state Statistical Bureau of 
China, with the deepening of China's reform, failing to meet 
demand of market by Chinese enterprises has become the main 
factor conditioning their low economic efficiency. 
  The report said with the economic system reform got underway 
in an overall way and the implementation of those regulations 
concerned in recent years, adjustment of market force had played 
more and more important role. An investigation made by relevant 
departments in 1991 into loss-making 50 enterprises from 
Beijing, Shenyang and Tianjin had attributed the reason for loss 
of these enterprises to wrong policies, unfavourable 
circumstances and bad management, which made up 19.4 percent, 
47.8 percent and 32.8 percent of the total reason respectively. 
However, according to another investigation made in last year 
into more than 2500 loss-making enterprises from eight provinces 
and cities such as Shanghai, Shandong and Jilin, the ratios of 
the reason of wrong policies and unfavourable circumstances had 
dropped to 9 percent or so respectively and the ratio of the 
reason of bad management in these enterprises risen to about 82 
percent, indicating bad management and failure in meeting demand 
of market had become the main factor conditioning their economic 
efficiency.

<F P=106> ["Chinese Economic News" column: "Certain Preferential </F>
Policies on Enterprises' Income Tax"] 
  [Text] The Ministry of Finance and the State General 
Administration of Taxation issued a notice a few days ago 
revoking all preferential enterprise tax policies, except for 
those which are strongly related to certain policies, have an 
impact on many sectors, and are conducive to economic 
development and social stability, which will remain in force 
after being scrutinized and defined. The notice stressed that 
with immediate effect, no localities and departments have the 
authority to draft preferential enterprise tax policies. 
  Those preferential policies which remain in force and have 
been newly defined mainly benefit: 
  -- Enterprises based in State Council-approved high and new 
technological development and production zones and recognized by 
the concerned departments as being involved in high and new 
technology. These enterprises may enjoy a 15 percent reduction 
in tax. High and new technology enterprises located in State 
Council-approved high and new technology development and 
production zones may enjoy a two-year tax moratorium beginning 
with the year the enterprise starts production. 
  -- Scientific research units and colleges, which may be 
provisionally exempted from tax on income earned from 
technological transfers, technical training programs, technical 
consultation and services, and contracted technical services 
commissioned by or provided to industries. 
  -- Newly founded, independently audited firms or units 
involved in consultancy (including consultancy on science and 
technology, law, accounting, auditing, taxation), information 
industry, and technical services. These firms and units may be 
exempted from tax for two years, beginning with the first day 
they open for business. Newly founded and independently audited 
firms or units involved in transport and post and 
telecommunications industries may be exempted from tax in the 
first year, beginning with the first day they open for business, 
and may enjoy a 50 percent tax reduction in the second year. 
Newly founded and independently audited firms or units involved 
in public utilities, commerce, material supply, foreign trade, 
tourism, warehousing, residents' services, catering services, 
and educational, cultural, and public health services may, 
subject to approval by the responsible tax authorities, be 
exempted from tax in their first year, beginning on the first 
day of business. Tax reduction calculations for newly founded 
tertiary-production enterprises with diversified trading are 
based on their main line of business. 
  -- Enterprises and non-profitmaking institutions. Income 
earned from technological transfers and technical consultancy, 
services, and training arising in the course of technological 
transfers by these bodies is provisionally exempt from tax if 
the net annual amount is less than 300,000 yuan. Any portion 
above the 300,000-yuan limit is taxed according to relevant laws. 
  -- Enterprises hit by typhoons, fires, floods, earthquakes, 
and other natural disasters. With approval from the responsible 
tax authorities, these enterprises may have their taxes reduced 
or waived for one year. Township and town enterprises thus 
afflicted may get a 10 percent reduction in taxable income, and 
the money thus saved can then be spent on social relief; in this 
case, the method of levying 10 percent of taxable income in 
advance will be suspended. 
  The policy of waiving tax on income earned from outside the 
borders by newly founded companies working on overseas contracts 
will continue to be in force until the end of 1995. 
  The above preferential policies came into effect on 1 April 
1994. Enterprises may continue to enjoy tax reductions 
previously granted by the now revoked preferential policies 
until the end of their terms.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China is paying more 
attention to the post-evaluation and supervision of state 
investment activities, as the country's construction scale 
becomes larger day by day. 
  Addressing a high-level seminar on the post-evaluation of 
project performance, sponsored by the World Bank, Minister of 
Finance Jin Renqing [name and title as received] said that it is 
imperative to set up a post-evaluation system that supervises 
and controls state investment activities and increase investment 
returns and quality. 
  Statistics show that the country's total investment will 
reach 1500 billion yuan this year and about 800 billion will 
come from the government. 
  Jin explained that post-evaluation means investigation of 
social and economic activities carried out at present or in the 
past. Post-evaluation can give evidence of whether the 
investment activity is reasonable and effective or not and put 
forward suggestions and basis for future decision making. 
  Jin said that as one of the important methods for 
macro-economic control, the post-evaluation system has been 
widely adopted in the world in recent years. 
  In the year 1988, China began trial post-evaluations of 
major 
state construction projects. Up till now it has conducted 
qualitative analysis of 33 projects, nine of which use foreign 
investment. 
  However, as Jin put it, China's post-evaluation lacks 
authority, fairness and transparency due to the fact that it is 
handled separately by state finance, planning, banking, and 
auditing departments. 
  Jin Renqing pointed out that it is a very complicated task 
to 
establish a post-evaluation system best suited to China's 
national conditions. 
  He said that the new system should be rational and operable, 
and in setting up such system, both the long- and short-term 
interests should be taken into account. 
  "It needs time," Jin concluded. 
  Officials from the Finance Ministry disclosed that so far 
two 
methods for setting up the system have been raised with the help 
of the World Bank. 
  One is to establish a unified and independent state post- 
evaluation organ to coordinate supervision over the performances 
of investment projects nationwide. 
  The other is to let the international engineering consulting 
company, the state auditing administration and other departments 
concerned carry out post-evaluation under the leadership of the 
State Planning Commission. 
  At today's seminar, the second method received much support 
from participants. 
  But Jin Renqing assured participants that after the 
post-evaluation method has been adopted throughout the country, 
China will certainly organize a state post-evaluation department. 
  Information from the state Finance Ministry revealed that a 
basic construction finance office has been set up in the finance 
ministry, which will conduct financial management and investment 
benefits analysis on state major construction projects and 
external debts. 
  The World Bank has promised to provide 400,000 U.S. dollars 
to help China invite world-famous consultants to carry out 
special-subject investigations on setting up a post-evaluation 
system in the country.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The stable exchange rate 
of the Chinese currency -- the yuan -- against the U.S. dollar 
serves as an illustration of the initial success China has 
scored in the reform of its foreign exchange system, according 
to bank executives. 
  Executives of 14 banks authorized by China's central bank to 
trade in hard currency are meeting here to summarize the 
experiences since the two-tier exchange rates were merged at the 
beginning of 1994. 
  According to these executives, the yuan has been quoted at 
8.70 against the U.S. dollar since then. 
  They agreed that the stability of the yuan has provided a 
stable financial environment for China to expand trade and 
economic cooperation with other countries. 
  Such stability has also made it possible for Chinese 
enterprises to improve management, China to gear its economy 
with the economy of the world as a whole, they said, adding that 
it also encourages more overseas firms to invest in China. 
  They cited a big increase in exports as another success in 
the reform of the foreign exchange system. 
  For example, exports shot up 18.7 percent in the first 
quarter of this year over the same period in 1993. Developed 
areas in China reported an even bigger increase in exports 
during that period. 
  They agreed that another success was that the inflow of hard 
currencies exceeded selling and state foreign exchange reserves 
are eight billion U.S. dollars more than in early 1994. 
  In April, banks designated by the central bank to deal in 
hard currency registered an inflow of hard currency totalling 
7.31 billion U.S. dollars and sold 4.18 billion dollars, leaving 
a surplus of 3.14 billion dollars. 
  Also in April, 2.69 billion U.S. dollars and 2.4 billion 
Hong 
Kong dollars changed hands in the Shanghai-based foreign 
exchange trading center. 
  The operation of inter-bank hard currency trading markets 
has 
created a mechanism under which exchange rates are set according 
to market demand, they said. 
  That will enable the central bank to intensify its 
macro-economic control, they added. 
  The executives also noted that sufficient hard currency was 
traded in swap centers to meet the needs of foreign-funded 
businesses. 
  In April, such businesses sold a total of 135 million U.S. 
Dollars and 64 million HK [Hong Kong] dollars in 19 swap centers 
all over the country.

  [Text] In a further indication of China's continuing 
efforts to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), it is now considering some adjustments to the special 
privileges meted out to foreign investors in the country. Ma 
Xiuhong, a senior official from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Trade &amp; Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), said yesterday that 
the 
ministry was examining how to modify the preferential treatment 
to meet the requirements of GATT and its successor the World 
Trade Organization (WTO). 
  "Apparently, some of the preferential policies go against 
the 
GATT rules and should be modified appropriately. However, there 
will be some phase-out periods, as shown by current GATT 
members, which could still give preferential treatment to 
foreign investors," Ma, the deputy director-general of the 
ministry's foreign investment administration, said. 
  China hopes to join GATT this year before it is replaced by 
the WTO. 
  Foreign investors who operate in China enjoy lower customs 
tariffs, more tax incentives, and longer tax holidays than the 
domestic enterprises, among other forms of preferential 
treatment. The situation is further complicated by the fact that 
foreign-funded ventures in the Special Economic Zones and 
Economic Development Zones enjoy even better treatment. 
  Meanwhile, Ma said that she was confident that China would 
get the renewal of the most favoured nation [MFN] trading status 
from the U.S. "I believe that the Sino-U.S. business 
relationship will continue but there will still be quarrels in 
the future." 
  The U.S. President, Bill Clinton, must decide before June 3 
whether MFN status, which gives China the lowest tariffs for its 
goods, should be extended. 
  To illustrate growing confidence, Ma announced that China 
would hold a large-scale trade and investment conference that 
starts next Monday in Hong Kong, the largest of its kind to be 
held in the territory. The conference, which lasts four days, 
is jointly organised by the ministry and the Hong Kong Trade 
Development Council. A team of 160 trade officials from four 
Chinese ministries and 24 provinces and cities will seek foreign 
investment on 800 projects involved in industries from 
transportation to electronics. The Hong Kong conference comes 
after China staged a similar large-scale conference in the 
United States last month to drum up support from U.S. businesses 
for the renewal of MFN. 
  During the conference, senior officials from the nine 
ministries--including MOFTEC, the Ministry of Finance, the 
People's Bank of China, and China Securities Regulatory 
Commission -- will make presentations. 
  China has become the favoured destination for foreign 
investors. Last year it approved 83,265 foreign-funded projects, 
with the contract value of foreign investment at U.S.$110.85 
billion (about HK$864.64bn) and a total amount of U.S.$25.76 
billion actually invested.

  [Text] China's foreign investment development is seeing a 
new trend, with inner regions reporting a higher rate of 
increase in new foreign investment than the coastal areas, a 
visiting Chinese official says. 
  Speaking at a press conference yesterday for the coming 
four-day Hong Kong '94 China Trade and Investment Conference to 
be held in the territory next week, Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) deputy director-general Ma 
Xiuhong said the administration had seen rapid growth in foreign 
investments in inner regions since late 1992. 
  "As China's open door policy continues and foreign 
investments increase to a certain level along the coastal areas, 
inner regions have become the targets recently for most foreign 
investment," Ms Ma said. In addition, they (the inner regions) 
are also improving their own investment environment, which also 
contributes to the rapid growth," she said. 
  Ms Ma said the amount of foreign funds flowing into the 
inner 
regions last year exceeded that of the coastal areas by 5 to 10 
percent. 
  Earlier this year, China vowed to continue its foreign 
investment policy and extended it to the inner regions. "In 
fact, the trend had already begun in late 1992. But it was more 
obvious last year." 
  She said that in its bid to re-enter the General Agreement 
on 
Tariffs and Trade, China was "actively" refining its trade laws 
to conform to international standards. "We are determined to 
tailor a more secure and better protected environment for 
foreign investments in terms of adjusting our laws." 
  The country had stepped up work on trade regulations this 
year. "In the process of reform, the refinement of legislation 
is necessary and will be to the interest of foreign investments." 
  Moftec, under the Foreign Investment Administration, is to 
jointly host the Hong Kong' 94 China Trade and Investment 
Conference with the territory's Trade Development Council at the 
Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai. The conference 
begins on Monday and will continue until 26 May. Seminars on 
China's latest foreign investment policies will be held during 
the conference, to brief interested investors. 
  Meanwhile, China's April industrial production figures 
showed 
a year-on-year increase of 17.9 per cent, according to the State 
Statistics Bureau.

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- China is implementing a 
series of short-term measures to improve its intellectual 
property protection, and the effort is concentrated on 
legislation, Minister of Justice Xiao Yang said here today. 
  Xiao was speaking at the opening session of an international 
symposium on intellectual property protection attended by 130 
experts, lawyers and business people from China, Australia, 
Britain, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand 
and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  Also attending are representatives of the European and 
German 
patent offices. 
  According to the minister, legal regulations are being 
prepared that aim at punishing proven copyright violations. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese Government is to publish a decree on 
border control of goods involving rights violations. "Customs 
will be allowed a still bigger role in intellectual property 
protection and in preventing the entrance and exit of such 
goods," he said. 
  Xiao expected the decree to facilitate the implementation of 
the "Paris Convention on Protection of Industrial Intellectual 
Property" and the "Berne Convention on Protection of Literary 
and Artistic Works" to which China has acceded. 
  Law enforcement organs are being strengthened as part of an 
effort to improve copyright protection. Such organs and the 
departments of science, technology, and police as well as the 
industry and commerce administration are to jointly investigate 
major cases, he added. The supervision and review of law 
enforcement by local governments and State Council departments 
is also being improved. This will be carried out at irregular 
intervals and will be concentrated on cases which are "important 
and affecting many sides." 
  Professional societies and other non-governmental 
organizations concerned with rights protection will be 
encouraged and assisted by the state in offering consultancy and 
other services. 
  "China attaches great importance to intellectual property 
protection work, and is improving the legislation in this 
regard," Xiao noted, citing the laws passed in recent years on 
trademarks, patents, technical contracts and unfair competition. 
  China has acceded to a number of international conventions 
on 
intellectual property protection. "It is in the process of 
making its own protection work meet international standards," he 
said. "Law enforcement, on the whole, is good." 
  Meanwhile, the minister acknowledged the occurrence of 
rights 
violations and attributed this to a lack of understanding of the 
importance of rights protection on the part of some government 
departments and people. 
  "Intellectual property protection is an important part of 
China's policy of reform and opening to the world," he said. 
"It is vital for China to formulate laws to protect people's 
creative work and ensure normal operation of the socialist 
market economy."

<F P=106> [By Chen Xiao: "Anti-Inflation Efforts Are On Track"] </F>
  [Text] A continuous slowdown to the gung-ho economy in the 
second quarter of this year will help to cool down the sizzling 
inflation which may pose a threat to social stability. 
  Further progress will come around the corner as the central 
government sticks to an anti-inflation policy as its basic tune 
for the rest of the year. 
  At the same time, however, the central government will have 
to pay more attention to the lukewarm market demand which is 
believed to be putting the brakes on rapid economic growth and 
leaving mounting stockpiles of commodities in its wake. 
  "At the macroscopic level, the economy is getting onto a 
healthy track with declining industrial growth in the second 
quarter," said Li Guobin with the State Information Centre 
(SIC), who is in charge of short-term economic forecasting. 
  "It is encouraging that the general retail price index for 
the period is predicted to drop 16.7 percent, 3.4 percentage 
points down from the first quarter." 
  According to the SIC, manufacturing in the second quarter is 
predicted to grow at 18.0 percent, a slight drop of 0.6 
percentage points against the first quarter. 
  The growth of credit in circulation is estimated at 24.6 
percent, 3.4 percentage points slower than the rate of the first 
quarter. 
  According to a report released by the State Planning 
Commission, the gross domestic product will grow at the rate of 
12 percent in the first half of this year. 
  A slight drop in economic growth is desired by the central 
government, which is eager to free its hands from fighting 
economic overheating to focus instead on deepening reforms. 
  China badly needs a more relaxed environment to further its 
reforms in 1994, the year seen as the midpoint in China's era of 
reforms. 
  Although inflation is still reeling with a two-digit rate, 
resulting in negative interest rates, people are reluctant to 
open their purses in the market and choose instead to keep their 
money in the bank. 
  The outstanding bank savings are expected to climb 38 
percent 
to reach 1,770 billion yuan ($203.4 billion) in the second 
quarter. 
  "This may be the best way for people to protect themselves 
from inflation because most consumers have drawn lessons from 
the buying spree in 1988 and have become more cool-headed when 
shopping." said Zhang Yingxiang, an analyst with the State 
Statistics Bureau (SSB). 
  In 1988, when China first suffered successive months of 
double- digit inflation rates, people rushed into panic buying, 
caring little about the quality of the goods. 
  In comparison, people now invest more carefully. And their 
gloomy anticipation toward the bear stock market keeps them away 
from securities. 
  Prudent consumption will continue to jam the growth of 
retail 
sales. According to the SIC, the retail sales volume will 
likely dip 6 percentage points for a growth rate of only 19.3 
percent in the April-June period. 
  "In addition to inflation, the sluggish market demand will 
be 
another outstanding problem in the second quarter." Li said. 
  The growing stockpiles in warehouses add to the difficulties 
of enterprises suffering from a lack of credit. 
  According to the SSB, by the end of April, unsold products 
in 
State enterprises grew a disastrous 13.3 percent in value 
compared with the same period last year. 
  Moreover. the increasing stockpiles are shoving more 
enterprises into defaulting on their debts. The SSB said that 
state enterprises' debts jumped 29.5 percent by the end of April 
compared with the same period last year. 
  Producers of raw materials are not optimistic, since 
manufacturers are loathe to buy raw materials, speed up 
production, or try to sell their products for fear buyers will 
default on payment. 
  "The central bank should consider reducing interest rates to 
somewhat discourage rapid bank savings and encourage buying," Li 
said. 
  His view is shared by a few economists, giving two reasons. 
  The current round of inflation is not mainly caused by 
credit 
expansion but, instead, by the rise in production costs and 
grain prices which raged on at the end of last year. 
  At present, the price of producer goods is declining, which 
can help to reduce production costs and curb the possible 
further price hikes. 
  Meanwhile, residents will not rush to pull out their savings 
deposits if the interest rate is cut because the existing rate 
is already 9 percentage points lower than the inflation rate. 
  "Therefore, a slight cut in the interest rate will not 
likely 
cause a great decrease in bank savings," Li said. 
  But the central government is unlikely to take such action 
in 
the coming months. 
  However, some other economists, especially those with the 
central bank have suggested that the State Council should raise 
interest rates to slow down inflation. 
  It is a difficult decision for the policymakers. 
  Generally speaking, anti-inflation measures reduce consumer 
demand, which will choke State enterprises. However, easing 
credit will counteract the efforts against inflation.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The State Statistical 
Bureau (SSB) said today that the month of April saw basically 
normal development of China's national economy, thanks to the 
macro-economic control measures that started last June. 
  Industrial production was up by 170.9 billion yuan, 
representing a two percent increase over the average level in 
the previous three months, said an SSB report released today. 
  The SSB said that the investment structure in April was 
better than last year, with more money going to the transport 
industry, but less to machinery and textile industries, luxury 
villas and hotels. 
  State enterprises completed 55.4 billion yuan of investment 
in fixed assets, 8 percent more than the average level of the 
first quarter. 
  Demand and supply in consumer goods remained balanced, the 
ssb said, noting that the total retail sales reached 117 billion 
yuan, 24.3 percent more than in April of 1993 or a four percent 
increase in real terms. 
  The growth of exports outpaced that of imports for the first 
time since September 1992, with the export volume reaching 8.94 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  The state revenue receipts and expenditure increased by 23.5 
percent over April of 1993, according to the SSB, indicating the 
normal operation of the new tax system. 
  The bureau said that enterprises' shortage of funds was 
eased 
to some extent and the bank savings increased dramatically 
despite the fact that a large amount had been diverted to buy 
state treasury bonds. 
  The momentum of price hikes was blunted. Consumer price in 
the month was 21.7 percent higher than the same month of last 
year but the range of increase fell by 0.7 percentage points 
from March, it said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (CNS)--According to a report from 
the State Statistical Bureau on operation of the national 
economy in China, the economic development in the country last 
month was stable and the macro economic situation was basically 
normal. The price growth, however, was still high, difficulties 
facing state-owned enterprises still existed and macro control 
and adjustment still needed to continue. 
  Last month saw an increase of investment in fixed assets and 
the investment structure was improved with fixed assets 
investment in last month increased by 44.2 percent over the same 
period last year and by 8 percentage points over the first three 
months this year. Investment in transportation continued to grow 
and that in machinery, light industry and construction of 
vocational villages and luxurious villas was curbed. The 
overall investment structure in the country turned for better 
than the same period last year. 
  The social retail value of consumer goods in last month 
increased by 24.3 percent over the same period last year. Last 
month saw a steady increase of financial revenue. In the first 
four months of this year, the growth of financial revenue was 
slightly bigger than that of financial expenditure, indicating a 
normal operation of reform for the financial and tax system in 
the country. 
  The added-value earned from industry in the country last 
month increased by 17.9 percent over the same period last year 
with growth being 2 percentage points higher than the average 
growth in the first quarter this year. Growth of export was 
faster than that of import for the first time since September 
1992. The state's surplus of foreign exchange continued to grow 
and the financial situation in the country was on the whole 
good. Despite large scale of purchasing treasure bonds in the 
country, residential savings deposits in last month increased by 
RMB 15.9 billion [renminbi], loans for agricultural and 
industrial purposes also increased and currency withdrawal from 
circulation continued. 
  Last month saw a 21.7 percent rise of prices of consumer 
goods in the country over the same period last year with the 
prices for grain, catering trade, fruits, clothing and service 
items increasing by a comparatively large scale. Prices for 
vegetables, however, declined. In the first four months, 
residential living costs increased by 22.2 percent over the same 
period of last year and commodity retail prices by 20 percent. 
In this period, profits earned and tax paid by state-owned 
enterprises grew at a relatively large scale but at the same 
time, loss made by loss-making enterprises also increased by 
62.6 percent and capital occupation rate by products by 13.8 
percent. [sentence as received] 
  It is predicted that the national economic operation in this 
month in the country will remain in the "yellow light" zone with 
various kinds of economic indices to be nearly the same last 
month.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Tightening Monetary Policy Cools Inflation"] </F>
  [Text] The State clampdown on fixed-assets investment 
helped take the air out of China's ballooning inflation rate in 
April, the Statistics Bureau said yesterday. 
  In its monthly report, the bureau said retail prices soared 
20 per cent during the first four months of this year compared 
to the same period last year. 
  But in April alone, retail prices rose 19.6 percent, down 
from 24.5 percent in March. 
  And increases in consumer prices, including the service 
sector, dropped 0.7 percent in April to stand at 21.7 percent, 
the report added. 
  The bureau noted that government controls also throttled 
soaring service prices, including the catering trade, 
transportation, and financial business. 
  Bureau economists say spiralling prices are being kept at 
bay 
in the 36 major cities, typically reflected by consumer 
expenditures on vegetables and services. 
  But, they also warned that consumer prices in small cities, 
towns, and rural areas were still on the rise, particularly for 
grain, seafood, clothes, and services. 
  The bureau suggested the government keep a firm grip on the 
economy to ensure a general balance between supply and demand of 
goods on the market--a crucial factor in stabilizing prices. 
  While strengthening its controls on money supply to avoid 
runaway investment in fixed assets, creditors are expected to 
focus on key state projects, industrial firms, and agricultural 
production, the bureau added. 
  Last month, fixed-assets investment by State units was 55.4 
billion yuan ($6.4 billion), up 44.2 percent from the same 
period of last year. 
  But this represented a fall in the growth rate. In April 
1993 fixed-assets investment grew 66.1 percent compared to the 
year before. 
  Since the clampdown on fixed assets began last year, the 
government has effectively cut the money supply to 
machine-building, textiles, and construction of villas and 
hotels. 
  The development has helped bring a 22 percent increase to 
the 
state revenue this year. 
  Strict control over the money supply, which severely hurt 
the 
state industries in the first quarter, brought a glimmer of hope 
for them to recover production strength last month. 
  Backed by state financial support, the state-owned 
enterprises, considered the country's industrial pillar, 
generated 84.7 billion yuan ($9.7 billion) in profits and taxes 
during the first four months of this year. That's up 22.1 
percent from the same period last year. 
  In the first quarter, state-owned factories output grew only 
2.2 percent. But in April, it went up to 5 percent. 
  The bureau added that national industrial output nearly hit 
171 billion yuan ($19.6 billion) in April, up 17.9 percent from 
the same period last year. 
  After taking inflation into account, domestic retail sales 
increased 4 percent in April to reach 117 billion yuan ($13.4 
billion).

<F P=106> ["Special articles on establishing a bankruptcy mechanism </F>
and improving it"--first paragraph is LIAOWANG editor's note] 
  [Text] [Editors note] As the main components of 
China's publicly owned economy, quite a great number of large 
and medium-sized state enterprises have long lacked 
competitiveness and vitality, their economic returns are not 
good, and their productivity is low. An important reason is 
that no bankruptcy mechanism has been established. As a result, 
enterprises which should go out of business are still operating, 
enterprises which should be invigorated cannot be invigorated, 
and factors of production which should be reorganized remain 
stagnant, all causing idleness and a waste of resources and 
hampering the improvement of overall economic returns. To 
escape this predicament, there is a need to establish a 
bankruptcy mechanism which conforms with the socialist market 
economy so that the suitable survive, the inferior disappear, 
and the superior develop. This will help ensure the rational 
allocation of resources and promote healthy economic 
development. For this reason, LIAOWANG has invited three 
academics from the State Economic and Trade Commission who have 
participated in revising the Bankruptcy Law to express their 
views from different angles. Their views are full of insights 
and are thus worth reading. [End editor's note] 
<H5>  Present Situation and Difficulties Should Be Clearly </H5>
Acknowledged-- by Di Na [3695 1226] 
  According to incomplete statistics, all levels of people's 
courts have handled 948 bankruptcy cases since the formal 
implementation of the Bankruptcy Law on 1 November 1988. Of 
this, enterprise bankruptcy cases handled in the last three 
years account for 86.36 percent, standing at 818. This 
development trend indicates that the old structure's role is 
gradually weakening in harboring old enterprises and that a 
bankruptcy and elimination mechanism which corresponds with the 
demand of the market economy is taking shape. Its main 
characters are as follows: 
<H5>  Bankrupt Large- and Medium-Sized State Enterprises Are </H5>
Increasing 
  Surveys in Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Sichuan, Hubei, and 
Jiangxi Provinces suggest that there have been medium-sized 
state enterprise bankruptcy cases in these provinces. These 
bankrupt enterprises' assets exceed 10 million yuan each and the 
ratio between their assets and liabilities is 1:2.5 or 1:3.63. 
The asset liquidation rate is over 40 percent in the three 
southern provinces but is a little lower in northeast China. 
Each of these enterprises has more than 1,000 employees and the 
largest has almost 3,000; retired personnel account for more 
than 20 percent of the total number of employees and the highest 
was 43.13 percent. Following the increased reform impetus, 
large and medium-sized state enterprises which have incurred 
losses for a long time and do not have much hope of survival are 
beginning to go bankrupt. Unlike small collective enterprises, 
whose bankruptcy only has a superficial bearing, the bankruptcy 
of large- and medium-sized state enterprises involves structural 
adjustments, asset allocations, debt repayments, employment, 
social relief, and other problems of a more profound and 
extensive nature, such as the strict implementation of policies. 
Obviously, there are more problems in handling these bankruptcy 
cases. 
<H5>  In Most Cases Debtors Apply for Bankruptcy </H5>
  The Bankruptcy Law provides that both creditors and debtors 
may apply for bankruptcy. But a survey indicates that almost 
all bankruptcy cases are filed by debtors. This suggests that 
the debtors have improved their understanding of protecting 
their legitimate rights and interests by legal means. 
Comparatively speaking, because enterprises lack the necessary 
covert system, it is difficult for creditors (except for banks) 
to know an enterprise's credit situation, so they do not know 
how their rights and interests have been damaged. In addition, 
because the liquidation rate of bankrupt enterprises is unlikely 
to reach 100 percent, creditors are generally unwilling to apply 
for bankruptcy. Subjectively and objectively, this has reduced 
the possibility of creditors applying for bankruptcy. To 
provide legal protection for creditors, it is imperative to 
establish an enterprise bankruptcy warning system. 
<H5>  The Greatest Creditors Are Banks </H5>
  As "fund allocations have been replaced by loans," 
enterprises' funds mainly come from bank loans, thus banks have 
become the biggest creditors. Since the introduction of banking 
system reform, specialized banks have become commercialized and 
are assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses, as 
financial enterprises operate. Therefore, banks themselves will 
also face the problem of removing their burdens. 
  According 
to an estimate by the state specialized banks, of 2,400 billion 
yuan in credit funds, almost 400 billion is dormant, accounting 
for 16.7 percent. About 60 to 70 percent of bank credit funds 
come from citizens' deposits. If losses are too serious, this 
will affect the banks' reputation and even endanger social 
stability. Therefore, a policy must be cautiously worked out in 
full consideration of the banks' capacity. Moreover, the 
introduction of bankruptcy will help the banks to free 
themselves from their predicament and reduce losses to a 
minimum. In this sense, bankruptcy also serves as a kind of 
protection for creditors and is a practical choice for banks to 
protect their legitimate rights and interests. In addition, in 
raising funds through various channels, some enterprises have 
opened accounts with many banks and engaged in duplicate 
mortgaging; the department in charge of enterprises instructs 
some enterprises with a good reputation to act as sponsors for 
enterprises with a bad reputation to obtain bank loans, or 
otherwise the department itself acts a sponsor, causing a number 
of bankruptcy cases to be linked to sponsorship. Obviously, it 
is imperative to improve the relevant mortgage and sponsorship 
policies in implementing the Bankruptcy Law. 
<H5>  When an Enterprise Announces Bankruptcy, the Government Is </H5>
Ready To "Pick Up the Corpse" 
  An enterprise should abide by the law when announcing its 
bankruptcy, but in the current situation it is difficult to 
fully abide by the law. Therefore it is often the case that 
"bankruptcy is combined with merging." Namely, before an 
enterprise announces its bankruptcy, the government will appoint 
another enterprise to merge with or buy it, and all levels of 
courts have taken this as a precondition in handling bankruptcy 
cases. A survey indicated that assets under bankruptcy are hard 
to enliven and even harder to convert into cash. No one cares 
about buying a bankrupt enterprise's special equipment, big 
buyers are not willing to buy its general-purpose equipment, and 
small buyers cannot afford this equipment, so it becomes a scrap 
of iron if dismantled, and banks find it difficult to assess 
prices. A bankrupt enterprise sets prices for its factories and 
equipment and asks a bank to accept them in kind, but existing 
policies do not allow the bank to deal in these factories and 
equipment. If the bank wants to authorize a company to deal in 
these factories and equipment, no go-between is available ; if 
it wants to auction them off, there is no auction center. 
Finally, the government has no alternative but to buy them. In 
providing jobs for employees of bankrupt enterprises, most local 
governments are still acting as "mothers." Providing jobs for 
bankrupt enterprises' employees is carried out administrative 
means: Either the government assigns these employees to other 
enterprises or the department in charge and the labor 
(insurance) department share the responsibility to provide jobs 
to these employees. On this issue, local governments do not 
know what to decide: If they assign these employees to other 
enterprises, this will trample on those enterprises' autonomy in 
recruiting employees and goes against the Regulations on 
Transforming State-Owned Enterprises' Operational Mechanisms. 
If they do not assign the employees, they will ask mayors for 
help, because the labor force market is not yet mature. The 
situation is a little better in South China, where many city or 
prefectural authorities convert assets under bankruptcy into 
cash and provide each employee with 15,000 to 20,000 yuan if 
they want to look for a job themselves. If there is an 
enterprise willing to accept the employee, money will be 
provided to the recipient enterprise. A survey indicates that 
more than 90 percent of such employees are willing to accept 
this method. 
  Practicing bankruptcy and establishing a bankruptcy 
mechanism 
are important issues which are inevitable in the course of 
deepening reform and forming a modern enterprise system. 
However, viewing the current bankruptcy situation, it is quite 
hard to practice bankruptcy and form a bankruptcy mechanism. 
Policy research on bankruptcy should be aimed at the following 
four points: 
  First, relief for employees and their job arrangements. 
  Providing relief for employees and rearranging jobs for them 
are the most difficult problems state-owned enterprises face 
after bankruptcy. Recently, the government pointed out that 
after an enterprise announces bankruptcy, the money derived from 
asset transfers and auctions should first be used for employee 
severance pay, transfers to other jobs, training, and basic 
livelihood. Transferring and auctioning assets will help resolve 
relief funds for employees after bankruptcy. Practice has 
proven that the government cannot wholly take care of a bankrupt 
enterprises' employees. These employees should be given jobs in 
a decentralized way in accordance with the "Regulations on 
Placement Arrangements for State Enterprises' Surplus Staff 
Members and Workers." Namely, surplus employees should be 
treated as job-awaiting personnel according to society's 
capacity. During the job-awaiting period, they are entitled to 
job-awaiting insurance, and if this is not possible, cash 
converted from the bankrupt enterprise's assets should be used 
for placement arrangements. To reduce repercussions in society, 
the department in charge will be responsible for providing 
relief and making placement arrangements for a bankrupt 
enterprise's employees before the social insurance system is 
improved. Many methods can be used to resolve the reemployment 
problem of bankrupt enterprise's employees, such as transferring 
them in an organized way, allowing them to participate in 
overseas labor service, recommending them to other enterprises, 
providing for themselves by engaging in production, and looking 
for jobs by themselves. 
  Second, definition of a bankrupt enterprise assets. 
  Whether or not a bankrupt enterprise's land, welfare 
facilities, and employee-raised funds should be listed as assets 
under bankruptcy is an important question. When an old state 
enterprise goes bankrupt, the net value of its fixed assets is 
very low, what is valuable is generally its land. Whether or 
not its land should be listed as an asset under bankruptcy can 
be determined by how the land was obtained. To put it more 
specifically, if the land utility rights were obtained by 
compensatory means, the land should be listed as an asset under 
bankruptcy; if not, the land should in principle not be listed 
as an asset under bankruptcy but should be returned to the 
government to encourage other units to buy the whole bankrupt 
enterprise. The bankrupt enterprise's schools, kindergartens, 
employees' dormitories, and other welfare facilities should in 
principle not be listed as assets under bankruptcy. These 
schools and kindergartens will be recovered by the government 
after being converted into cash, dormitories should be sold to 
individuals or housing departments to clearly separate 
management from ownership, employees involved in fund raising 
will be reimbursed as creditors or shareholders. 
  Third, mortgaging assets under bankruptcy and converting 
them 
into cash. 
  Many enterprises have mortgaged their assets as security to 
obtain bank loans. The Bankruptcy Law provides that "assets 
mortgaged as security do not fall into the category of assets 
under bankruptcy." Therefore many localities have pointed out 
that if the bank does not give up its priority entitlement to 
compensation, the enterprise actually has nothing to declare 
bankrupt for. A survey indicates that the mortgage rate of many 
bankrupt enterprises' fixed assets is as high as 100 percent. 
When an enterprise faces bankruptcy, it may not be able to pay 
bankruptcy expenses because it lacks adequate assets to pay. 
This is a difficult problem to resolve in practicing 
bankruptcy. In addition, some bankrupt enterprises are located 
in remote regions and their utility is low. It is hard to 
convert their assets and land utility rights into cash. 
  Fourth, sponsor-related responsibility. 
  How to handle sponsor-related bankruptcies is another 
problem 
in practicing the Bankruptcy Law. Because the practice of 
sponsorship is not standardized, in particular administrative 
sponsorship is quite common, we should consider classifying 
sponsors' debt repayment obligations. 1) Administrative 
sponsorship provided after the promulgation of the State Council 
Office's "Circular on Banning Administrative Institutions From 
Acting as Sponsors in Economic Activities" on 23 February 1993 
must all be nullified. 2) A unit acting as an administrative 
sponsor which has become a legal person entity is responsible 
for the loan repayments it has committed to. 3) If a unit 
acting as an administrative sponsor and which remains an 
administrative institution cannot afford the loan repayments it 
has committed to, a financial department will repay the loan or, 
if necessary, money will be deducted from the institution's 
wages and administrative expenditure as punishment. 
<H5>  Removing Ideological Obstacles--by Zhang Delin (1728 1795 </H5>
7207) 
  Since the introduction of reform and opening up, many people 
have gradually improved their concept about bankruptcy. On 2 
December 1986, the National People's Congress Standing Committee 
formally ratified the "PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy Law (for trial 
implementation), which came into force on 1 November 1988. But 
so far, the bankruptcy concept has not taken deep root in 
people's minds and no bankruptcy mechanism has been established. 
There are many reasons, but for now it is important to remove 
ideological obstacles. 
<H5>  Bankruptcy Is Not a "Unique Practice Under Private Ownership" </H5>
  For a long period we have linked bankruptcy to the nature of 
ownership and have regarded bankruptcy as an inevitable product 
and even a unique economic phenomenon of private ownership or 
the capitalist system and that it has absolutely nothing to do 
with the socialist system. As a matter of fact, bankruptcy is 
an inevitable product of competition under commodity economic 
conditions; whenever there is commodity production and commodity 
exchange, bankruptcy will occur in the course of this production 
and exchange. Bankruptcy is linked to the commodity economy and 
its relevant competition system, not to the nature of ownership. 
China is establishing a socialist market economic structure. 
Bankruptcy and the need to establish a relevant bankruptcy 
system are the demands of a market economy. The problem now is 
not whether or not bankruptcy and the establishment of a 
bankruptcy system are necessary but how to practice bankruptcy 
and establish a bankruptcy system which conforms with reform 
targets and current national conditions. 
<H5>  Practicing Bankruptcy and Establishing the Bankruptcy System </H5>
Are Positively Significant 
  Theory and practice in a modern market economy have proved 
that a competitive market economic structure is the most 
efficient mechanism and system for resource disposition in the 
modern human society. Bankruptcy is an outcome of competition 
and is also the beginning of a new round of competition. 
Generally speaking, a bankrupt enterprise is an enterprise with 
improper management and administration which is falling behind 
and should be eliminated. Allowing the deserving to survive, 
eliminating the inferior, and developing the superior is where 
the vitality of economic development lies and is also a symbol 
of social progress. Therefore practicing bankruptcy and 
establishing a relevant bankruptcy system have important 
bearings on deepening state enterprise reform, on forming a 
modernized enterprise system, on establishing a competition 
mechanism, and on optimizing the allocation of social resources. 
  Practicing Bankruptcy and Establishing a Bankruptcy 
System Are Needed To Establish a Modern Enterprise System 
  A review of state-owned enterprises' operations in China 
suggests that only a small number of them are operating 
normally, quite a few of them lack vitality and operate with low 
efficiency, and some even find it hard to continue operations. 
How should these state-owned enterprises free themselves from 
their predicament? In terms of target formula, there is a need 
to establish a modern enterprise system. In other words, there 
is a need to establish an enterprise legal person system which 
corresponds with a modern market economy and large-scale 
socialized production, a limited liability system, and a 
relevant organizational system and management system. In terms 
of implementation measures and detailed methods, the process of 
introducing a new enterprise asset system as well as its 
responsibility, organization, and management systems is a 
process of establishing a bankruptcy system. Loss-incurring 
state enterprises should have their assets reorganized and 
systems updated through bankruptcy. In this sense, the process 
of reforming state enterprises and establishing a modern 
enterprise system is also a process of establishing a bankruptcy 
system. In other words, without bankruptcy and a relevant 
bankruptcy system, it will be very hard to establish a 
competitive microfoundation or macromanagement structure. 
<H5>  Bankruptcy Is an Economic Activity in the Course of </H5>
Competition and Is Also a Legal Activity Which Proceeds in 
Strict Accordance With Law 
  In a sense, the process of practicing bankruptcy and 
establishing a bankruptcy system is a process of formulating a 
relevant legal system. Therefore, to promote the establishment 
of a bankruptcy system in China, a bankruptcy law should be 
formulated which conforms with national conditions. China 
already has a bankruptcy law for trial implementation, but it 
takes the "planned commodity economy" as its structural 
objective. Therefore, it is imperative to revise this 
bankruptcy law by taking the socialist market economy as its 
structural objective. Apart from observing laws of the market 
economy in general and absorbing and referring to foreign 
countries' successful experiences and practice in legislation, 
we must base ourselves on national conditions in revising the 
Bankruptcy Law. The bankruptcy system has gradually taken shape 
in foreign countries in the course of free competition. This is 
not entirely the same as China's background and economic 
environment in which its bankruptcy system is being formed. In 
pronouncing state enterprises' bankruptcies, we are facing 
knotty problems such as how to distinguish between management 
and ownership, how to straighten out the relation between 
creditors and debtors, and how to establish an unemployment and 
social insurance system. The settlement of these problems 
requires the Bankruptcy Law to provide general stipulations and 
our formulation of detailed methods and procedures. In addition, 
because many state-owned enterprises face or are engaged in 
bankruptcy, it is necessary, in the course of practicing 
bankruptcy and through trial implementation, to gradually form a 
bankruptcy system which conforms with the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure and national conditions and 
which also converges with international practice. 
<H5>  Ensuring the Establishment and Operation a Bankruptcy </H5>
Mechanism by Legal Means--by Zheng Yang [6774 2799] 
  The nucleus of the bankruptcy system is that an enterprise 
is 
entitled to a legal person's property and independent 
operational rights; more importantly, it is required to 
undertake operational risks and perform its social 
responsibility. For this reason, we should strengthen the legal 
concept, learn how to apply the Bankruptcy Law, promote and 
ensure fair competition between enterprises, and develop the 
superior and eliminate the inferior to maintain good market 
economic order. Efforts should also be made in the following 
three aspects: 
<H5>  In Legislation: Bankruptcy Legislation Should Be </H5>
Strengthened Along With the Improvement of the Bankruptcy System 
  A bankruptcy law is the general way of legally standardizing 
bankruptcy procedures and adjusting bankrupt enterprises' legal 
relations. A bankruptcy law is quite important to deepening 
China's enterprise reform, protecting creditors' and debtors' 
legitimate rights and interests, and establishing a socialist 
market economic structure. The existing bankruptcy law in China 
is the "PRC Enterprise Bankruptcy Law (for trial 
implementation)" promulgated on 2 December 1986 and formally 
implemented on 1 November 1988. At that time, it portrayed 
enterprise reform as well as social and economic development, 
but the situation has changed and many new problems have arisen 
since. In practice, we have not effectively enforced the 
Bankruptcy Law, nor has our efficiency been high in handling 
bankruptcy cases. This has seriously affected our efforts to 
protect creditors' and debtors' rights and interests. Therefore 
in this new situation, it is imperative to formulate a new 
bankruptcy law suitable for all enterprise legal persons, to 
comprehensively clarify the legal aim and basic principles of 
this new law, and to provide stipulations on creditors' rights 
and creditors panels, assets under bankruptcy and their 
management, bankruptcy documents and applications, handling of 
bankruptcies, court jurisdiction, conciliation and 
rectification, bankruptcy pronouncements, bankruptcy 
liquidation, and legal responsibility. 
  This will enable 
the new bankruptcy law to conform with socialist market economic 
development, to fully refer to and absorb the essence of foreign 
bankruptcy laws, to converge and coordinate with international 
practice, and to effectively protect the legitimate rights and 
interests of creditors and debtors. To properly implement the 
new bankruptcy law and fulfill the expected targets, detailed 
implementation regulations should be announced as soon as 
possible after the promulgation of the new bankruptcy law so as 
to strengthen this new law's practicality and integrity. In the 
meantime, the social insurance system should be improved along 
with its legislation. The social insurance system basically 
comprises these five aspects: social relief, social insurance, 
social welfare, social assistance, and medical care. In 
connection with this, there are five legal provisions, including 
providing material relief for staff members and workers who have 
special difficulties; the raising and use of social insurance 
funds (such as providing relief for elderly people, patients, 
unemployed people, and so on); and legal responsibility. These 
legal provisions will help maintain social stability and 
fairness and are indispensable to the market economy. 
<H5>  Propaganda and Education: Propaganda and Education on </H5>
Bankruptcy Law Should be Strengthened and the Concept About 
Bankruptcy Should Be Improved 
  Due to the prolonged influence of the planned economy, many 
people have belittled the role of the bankruptcy system and some 
do not even know what bankruptcy and the Bankruptcy Law are. 
Therefore, bankruptcy legal knowledge should be popularized and 
propagated so that the concept of bankruptcy and elimination 
will take deep root in the people's minds. In this case, 
everyone will be able to reduce their mental obstacles to 
understanding enterprise bankruptcy, improve their concepts of 
bankruptcy, take precautions against bankruptcy, and prevent the 
emergence of bankruptcy. Thus enterprise operators and 
employees are required to have a sense of crisis or a concept 
about bankruptcy so that enterprises will move ahead with 
enterprising spirit, improve their management, produce better 
economic results, strengthen their ability and adaptability in 
the course of competition, and prevent themselves from going 
bankrupt. In addition, when there is an application for 
bankruptcy, the relevant department should try to reach a 
conciliatory agreement with creditors so that self-rectification 
can be carried out for revitalization. 
<H5>  In Law Enforcement Bankruptcy Law Must Be Seriously </H5>
Implemented To Protect Legitimate Rights and Interests 
  The normal operation of the market economy not only relies 
on 
legislation but also requires strict law enforcement. In this 
respect, the most important point is to improve the quality of 
relevant personnel and foster a number of professionals well 
versed in handling bankruptcy issues. In the meantime, research 
into bankruptcy crime must be taken into serious account. 
Bankruptcy itself is not a crime, but in a bankruptcy case, 
some debtors infringe on creditors' legitimate rights and 
interests by illegal and deceptive means. As a result, 
conciliation or bankruptcy cannot be carried out fairly or 
smoothly. If the case is serious, it may constitute a criminal 
offense. A policy should be worked out to deal with it. In 
short, law enforcement ability should be improved so that the 
implementation of China's Bankruptcy Law can be secured and 
actual results achieved.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Grasp the Opportunity, Revitalize the </F>
Pillar Industry" column by Sheng Huaren (4141 5478 0088), 
general manager of the China National Petrochemical Corporation: 
"The Petrochemical Industry in the Year 2000"] 
  [Text] Revitalizing the petrochemical industry and turning 
it into a pillar of the economy is a historical demand set forth 
by China's socialist modernization and also a major strategic 
task placed before the petrochemical industry. 
  The petrochemical industry occupies an important position 
and 
plays an important role in the national economy. It is a 
leading industry and a pillar which has supported economic 
takeoff and social development in many developed countries. The 
petrochemical industry has become an important scale to measure 
a country's economic strength and scientific and technological 
standards. In our country, the petrochemical industry is still 
a new industry. In the wake of more than 40 years' of 
development, and especially after the founding of the China 
National Petrochemical Corporation [CNPC] in 1983, a number of 
modern oil refining, chemical industry, chemical fiber, and 
chemical fertilizer enterprises have been established, thus 
substantially increasing the comprehensive strength of China's 
petrochemical industry. By the end of 1993, the total value of 
the assets of China's petrochemical industry amounted to 182.9 
billion yuan, an increase of more than 500 percent in 10 years; 
the petrochemical industry's sales reached 145.2 billion, an 
increase of more than 200 percent in 10 years; and the 
accumulated total financial revenue turned over by the 
petrochemical industry over the past 10 years was more than 130 
billion yuan. 
  In order to develop the petrochemical industry into an 
economic pillar, we must first of all set an aggressive, 
realistic target which can be accomplished through effort. This 
target must consist of both quantitative and qualitative 
criteria. Quantitatively speaking, we have put forth a basic 
idea about a two-stage program according to the guideline laid 
down by the central authorities. In the first stage, by 2000 we 
will raise the annual crude oil processing capacity to about 200 
million metric tons and ethylene production capacity to about 5 
million metric tons, thus initially upgrading the petrochemical 
industry to be a pillar of the national economy. In the second 
stage, by 2010, we will raise annual crude oil processing 
capacity to over 300 million metric tons and ethylene production 
capacity to 8-10 million metric tons, thus enabling China's 
petrochemical industry to approach or reach the advanced world 
levels both in terms of scale and actual capacity. Qualitatively 
speaking, our first main task is to increase the variety and 
brands of our products, raise our product quality and grade, 
increase economic returns, and strive to optimize the industry's 
returns. Over the past 10 years since the founding of the CNPC, 
returns (profits and taxes received) have doubled, from 10.7 
billion yuan in 1983 to 21.7 billion yuan in 1993. We are 
planning to double returns again in the next seven years, that 
is, by the year 2000, mainly through such measures as speeding 
up technological progress and intensifying business management. 
This will be a very arduous task to accomplish, as it requires 
us to work really hard indeed. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin has noted: "To strive for development we 
need new ideas too." In light of this spirit and the 
requirements laid down in an inscription written by Comrade 
Jiang Zemin, we need a new idea to guide our efforts to 
revitalize the petrochemical industry and build it into an 
economic pillar. We maintain that the eight-character principle 
of "large scale, advanced technology, serialization of products, 
and intensive production" must be upheld in order to explore a 
road with Chinese characteristics to speed up the development of 
the petrochemical industry, to revitalize the industry, and to 
build it into an economic pillar. Large scale means economies 
of scale. In other words, we should emulate the successful 
experiences of foreign countries, stress economies of scale when 
starting new projects in the future, oil refining installations 
must have an annual capacity of over 5 million metric tons each, 
ethylene installations must have an annual capacity of 450,000 
metric tons each, and all existing medium and small-scale 
installations must undergo technological transformation to 
gradually increase their economies of scale. Advanced 
technology means to implement in real earnest Comrade Xiaoping's 
idea that "science and technology is the primary productive 
force," keep track of advanced world standards, speed up 
scientific and technological progress, apply advanced technology 
in achieving the greatest economic returns, and seek development 
by tapping internal potential. While stressing self-reliance in 
vigorously developing new technology, we must also attach 
importance to assimilating and making use of the advanced 
technology available abroad so that our country's petrochemical 
industry can develop from a more advanced starting point. 
Serialization of products means to vigorously develop the 
intensive processing of crude oil, synthetic materials, and 
chemical materials; strive to develop a full range of upstream, 
midstream, and downstream products; produce high-quality 
products with advanced technology, new designs, high added 
value, and marketability; and constantly develop a series of 
products including oil products, plastic products, synthetic 
fibers, synthetic rubber, and fine petrochemical products. 
Intensive production means to sum up our practical experiences, 
boldly assimilate advanced management experience from abroad, 
establish a modern enterprise system and operational mechanism 
which suits the needs of the socialist market economic 
structure, and ensure scientific management, high efficiency, 
low inputs, and high outputs, thus scoring the best results. 
  Deepening reform is the only way out to revitalize the 
petrochemical industry and develop it into an economic pillar. 
According to the guidelines laid down in the "Resolution" 
adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, the CNPC must be gradually reorganized into a 
shareholding company to suit our country's national conditions. 
At the same time, it is necessary to fully delegate all the 
decision-making powers to enterprises that the "Regulations" 
have vested in them and to extricate enterprises from the yoke 
that has been placed on them by the highly centralized planned 
economic structure of the past, so that they become real, active 
entities in the market. Therefore, as far as business strategy 
is concerned, it is necessary to gradually develop a business 
operational mode characterized by the "group enterprise 
structure, transnational operations, the joint-stock system, and 
diversification." The introduction of the group enterprise 
structure means to give full play to the advantages of the 
socialist system which can pool resources to accomplish big 
projects and to give full play to the initiative of all 
departments of the corporation through the rational assignment 
of duties and readjustments of power and interests within the 
corporation, thus increasing the competitive power of Chinese 
petrochemical products in domestic and overseas markets. 
Transnational operation means to adapt to the international 
market and promote comprehensive cooperation with foreign 
countries, including measures to attract foreign businessmen to 
start investment projects and establish plants in China, import 
advanced foreign technology, jointly exploit oil resources with 
foreign investors, directly import oil resources from abroad, go 
straight to start investment projects and set up plants abroad, 
and expand exports of products, technology, and labor services, 
as well as overseas project contract operations. Promoting the 
joint-stock system means to encourage more local investors and 
foreign businessmen to run joint ventures in the petrochemical 
industry and to develop joint-stock companies in various forms 
after the model of a company with limited liability and a 
limited stock company. Existing enterprises also must carry out 
reform to introduce the joint-stock system step by step and in a 
planned way, and the CNPC must speed up its pace in transforming 
itself into a state-owned shareholding company. Diversification 
means extending intensive processing operation to produce 
midstream and downstream petrochemical products and to further 
develop more upstream products. At the same time, it is 
necessary to actively develop tertiary industry and gradually 
build up a large-scale diversified cross-trade and 
cross-sectoral operational structure which integrates industrial 
production, trading, commerce, banking, scientific and 
technological research and services, engineering, information 
services, and consultancy services, thus increasing economic 
returns and our economic strength.

<F P=106> [Fujian Province Government Work Report delivered by Fujian </F>
Governor Jia Qinglin to the Second Session of the Eighth 
Provincial People's Congress on 10 April] 
  [Text] Fellow Deputies, 
  On behalf of the provincial people's government, I now 
submit 
the report on the work of the government for your examination 
and approval, and also for suggestions and comments from members 
of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference and other observers. 
  In the past year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and in the spirit of the party's 14th congress 
and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
governments at all levels in Fujian have persistently focused 
their work on economic construction; conscientiously implemented 
a series of major policy decisions and arrangements of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council; actively pushed forward 
reform, opening up, economic construction, and social 
development; and successfully fulfilled all tasks put forward by 
the First Session of the 8th provincial people's congress in 
1993. 
  The national economy maintained sustained and 
high-speed growth. During the year, we persistently 
focused our work on optimizing the structure, strengthening 
management, and enhancing economic efficiency; reinforced 
macroeconomic control and regulation; carefully organized work 
in economic fields; and brought about continued comprehensive 
development to the national economy. The GNP for the year was 
96.79 billion yuan, up by 25.4 percent over the previous year, 
thus quadrupling the gross annual value of industrial and 
agricultural production in two decades, seven years ahead of 
schedule. The total agricultural output value stood at 39.526 
billion yuan, registering an increase of 11.3 percent. A sample 
survey has showed that the total grain output reached 8.69 
million tonnes (9.42 million tonnes according to overall 
statistics), while the total quantity of foodstuffs increased by 
860,000 tonnes. Fujian made new headway in reforesting barren 
mountains last year, and won the title of "advanced province in 
reforesting barren mountains." Last year, the planting of fruit 
trees, tea plants, and tobacco also underwent the biggest 
development in recent year. The total output of aquatic 
products was 1.9 million tonnes, up by 19 percent. The total 
output of township and town enterprises amounted to 110.25 
billion yuan, representing an increase of 94 percent. The total 
output value of industrial production reached 149 billion yuan, 
up by 48.2 percent; and the economic performance of the 
industrial sector was apparently improved. With a comprehensive 
indicator standing at 106, Fujian now ranks among the most 
advanced provinces in China. Society-wide fixed assets 
investment totalled 33.82 billion yuan, an increase of 71.4 
percent. Notable results were attained in "the year of 
infrastructural construction," and 13 key projects across the 
province were put into operation or basically completed. The 
construction pace of transportation, telecommunications, and 
power projects was accelerated; the Yinxia electric railway was 
opened to traffic, and the transformation of national highways 
was unfolded in a comprehensive way. The magnitude of 
telecommunications business increased by 64.9 percent, and 
797,000 new telephone sets were installed during the year. The 
generating capacity of the province increased by 220,000 kw over 
the previous year. The monetary order took an apparent turn for 
the better, the excessive issuance of currency was brought under 
control, and market exchange rates remained basically stable. 
The province's financial revenue totalled 11.058 billion yuan, 
registering an increase of 46.7 percent. The undertaking of 
people's insurance underwent healthy development, with the 
volume of business exceeding 2 billion yuan. Both urban and 
rural markets enjoyed brisk business, and the total volume of 
retail sales amounted to 42 billion, up 31.4 percent. 
  New results were scored in reform and opening up. 
Focusing on establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure, reform was gradually deepened in all fields. In 
carrying out enterprise reform, we focused our efforts on 
changing operational mechanisms of enterprises. Experiments 
with reform of the general input-output contract system and with 
unified management of economic performance unfolded in 340 
enterprises across the province, share-holding systems of 
various types were adopted by 343 enterprises, reform of 
state-own and people-run system was put into practice in 2,623 
enterprises engaged in domestic trade, and 92 enterprise groups 
were organized and established. 
  Meanwhile, we lifted 
control over grain prices across the province, and accelerate 
development of commodity markets as well as markets for major 
means of production, including capital, labor, technology, and 
information. We continued to open Fujian wider to the outside 
world. A number of policies guiding the free port of the Xiamen 
Special Economic Zone were further implemented, and both the 
Fuzhou Mawei and the Xiamen Xiangyu bonded zones were completed 
and put into operation. Foreign trade maintained strong 
development momentum. The total amount of newly approved 
foreign contracted investments reached $11.37 billion yuan, 
while the total foreign funds actually used amounted to $3.02 
billion, up by 79 and 106 percent respectively. Large-scale 
land exploration underwent steady development. Last year's 
revenue gained from land leases totalled 3.1 billion yuan. 
During the year, the 109 development zones across the province 
introduced a total of 1,077 foreign-invested projects, of which 
478 were put into production or will be completed in the near 
future. Export volume for the year totaled $5.825 billion, 
representing an increase of 36.3 percent. Economic and trade 
cooperation between Fujian and Taiwan was further promoted. A 
total of 1,010 new Taiwan-invested projects were approved during 
the year, which entailed Taiwan contracted investments of $1.549 
billion, up by 73.7 percent. The total trade volume with Taiwan 
stood at $2.037 billion, registering an increase of 290 percent. 
The total amount involved in construction projects contracted 
abroad reached $680 million, while foreign exchange earned from 
international tourism was equivalent to 910 million renminbi, up 
by 32.3 and 14.6 percent respectively. 
  All social undertakings attained steady 
development. We persistently placed science and technology 
and education in a strategic position and gave priority to their 
development. The provincial party committee and government 
issued a "Decision on Several Issues Concerning Acceleration of 
Reform and Development of Social Undertakings," put forward a 
series of preferential policies, set up a "foundation for the 
development of social undertakings in Fujian Province," and 
started constructing 10 such major projects. We further 
readjusted the structure of education, and as a result, the 
quality of teaching and the efficiency of school-running were 
enhanced. Elementary compulsory education was made accessible 
to 95 percent of the population and secondary education to 62.3 
percent of the population, up by 10 and 22 percentage points 
respectively. Good results were scored in tackling key technical 
problems and in commercializing scientific and technological 
results. A total of 187 research results won provincial-level 
awards for scientific and technological progress, while 850 were 
patented. New headway was also made in social scientific 
research. On the cultural front, both the "fragrant grass" and 
"a hundred flowers plans" attained breakthroughs at the present 
phase. We successfully held the second provincial children's 
art festival, as well as a cross-straits local opera festival 
and the 19th session of provincial theatrical festival. In a 
national appraisal of best publications, Fujian won the second 
largest number of awards among all domestic publishing houses. 
Public health was further improved in both urban and rural 
areas, and our ability to prevent and control diseases enhanced. 
Sports activities were extensively carried out among the masses. 
Fujian's athletes won good results in the 7th national sports 
meet, while both the 1st session of international taijiquan 
invitational tournament and the 5th Sino-Japanese taijiquan 
exchange competition proved to be successes. The work of family 
planning was promoted as a whole. For the first time in 
history, both the birth and natural growth rates of Fujian's 
population dropped to a level lower than the country's average, 
and the province has successfully fulfilled the population 
control tasks set by the state for three consecutive years. 
  The living standards of urban and rural residents 
continued to improve. After allowing for price rises, the 
annual average amount of per capita income that urban dwellers 
used for living expenses reached 2,605 yuan, while the average 
per capita net income of people in the countryside totaled 1,211 
yuan, representing increases of 6.8 and 7 percent respectively. 
The volume of bank savings of both urban and rural residents at 
the end of the year increased by 7.2 billion yuan. During the 
year, over 5 million square meters of floor space was added for 
the urban population, thus raising the per capita living space 
of urban dwellers to 10.8 square meters. Meanwhile, with an 
additional floor space of 1.8 million square meters, the per 
capital living area of rural residents reached 22.4 square 
meters, and 120,000 rural families moved in new houses. 
Consumption levels of both city and country people rose 
steadily, and their cultural life was enriched on a constant 
basis. Through the concerted efforts of all departments as well 
as governments at all levels, the provincial party committee and 
government successfully solved 15 major problems for the masses. 
  Public security and the general mood of the society 
were further improved. While accelerating development of 
the economy, governments at all levels adhered to the principle 
of "paying simultaneous attention to two types of work, 
attaching equal importance to both," and made vigorous efforts 
to strengthen the building of socialist spiritual civilization, 
clean administration, and the legal system. We conducted 
ideological and ethical education on patriotism, collectivism, 
and socialism on an extensive scale; carried out mass activities 
on building spiritual civilization, in which all units vied with 
each other in becoming civilized units; and unfolded activities 
of "dual support." We attained results in the present phase of 
implementation of major policy decisions of the central 
authorities on combatting corruption. Leading cadres at the 
county level and above conscientiously conducted self-criticism 
among themselves. Supervisory and procuratorial organs at all 
levels across the province dealt with and solved 1,218 cases of 
violation of law and discipline, and punished a number of 
corrupt cadres. Great efforts were taken to rectify a number of 
unhealthy practices, such as arbitrary collection of fees, 
making overseas travels at the expenses of the state, and the 
running of enterprises by party and government organs. As a 
result, unhealthy trends in government departments and trades 
were brought under control to a certain extent. The 
comprehensive rectification of public security was stepped up, 
and notable results were scored in special-purpose struggles 
against smuggling, illegal immigration, crimes committed by 
criminal rings, highway and railway robberies, and pornographic 
practices. 
  A review of the past year shows that we have attained great 
results in our work. Today, Fujian is enjoying rapid economic 
development, social stability and unity, and progress in each 
and every social undertaking. The living standards of the 
people have improved, and the entire society presents a picture 
of prosperity. It is the people of the whole province who, 
through their hard work in unity under the leadership of the 
party Central Committee, the State Council, and the provincial 
party committee, have made all these achievements possible. 
Moreover, we also attribute our accomplishments to the 
effective supervision of people's congresses at all levels, to 
the active participation of CPPCC committees at different levels 
as well as all democratic parties, to the vigorous support of 
the vast numbers of officers and men of the PLA and the armed 
police garrisoning Fujian, and to the sincere cooperation of our 
compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao and those residing 
overseas, as well as our international friends. On behalf of 
the provincial people's government, I wish to extend my 
heartfelt gratitude to all these people mentioned above. 
  During the past year, there were failings and mistakes in 
the 
work of the government, and some contradictions and difficulties 
still remain conspicuous in our way ahead. These are chiefly 
the following: The foundation of agriculture remains fragile, 
the total area under cultivation has been reduced by 130,000 mu, 
and a lack of enthusiasm has been shown among peasants in 
growing grain. "Bottleneck" restrictions in energy and 
transportation have deteriorated, railway transportation 
capacity is seriously inadequate, and highways, airports, and 
ports fail to meet the needs of current development. Power 
supply falls short of demand by 1.5 to 2 billion kw, and 
sometimes we find it hard to ensure the daily electricity supply 
for urban residents. Commodity prices still remain high, rising 
by 13.4 percent during the year, a level which is higher than 
the price control target of 10 percent. Rises in the prices of 
grain and non-staple foodstuffs, in particular, have impaired 
the living standards of the masses to a certain extent. 
Relatively slower progress has been registered in the 
development of social undertakings as a result of insufficient 
input and less perfect facilities. Problems still remain 
conspicuous in providing medical care and education for the 
masses. We have failed to bring fundamental changes to the 
backward look of some poor areas, or to find stable solutions to 
the problem of insufficient food and clothing for 800,000 people 
across the province. There still exist many problems with 
public security and production safety. The corrupt practices of 
a few government functionaries, as well as formalism and 
bureaucratism in government organs, have impaired close ties 
between the government and the masses. In carrying out our 
future work, we ought to face up to reality, acknowledge our 
shortcomings and mistakes, and seek careful and practical 
solutions to all problems in our work. 
  The year 1994 is an important year in our effort to maintain 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy, and also a vital year for the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure. We must seize current 
favorable opportunities, deepen reform, open Fujian wider to the 
outside world, bring about further development, and maintain 
social stability. This is the center of work for the whole 
party and country, and we must make sure that all our work is 
subordinate to and serves this endeavor. Development is the 
goal, reform is the motive, stability is the guarantee. These 
three form an organic whole. Correctly understanding and 
carefully handling relations among reform, development, 
stability, and making the three well-coordinated and 
complementary to each other is of vital importance to our 
accomplishment of all tasks set for this year. 
  The guiding 
ideology for this year's government work is as follows: Guided 
by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, as well as by the party's basic line, 
we should put into practice in every field of work the spirit of 
the 14th party congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, the Second Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress, and the Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth 
Fujian Provincial CPC Committee; firmly seize current 
opportunities; speed up reform and the building of a socialist 
market economic structure; carry out opening up at higher 
levels, in more fields, and in a greater depth; maintain 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy; promote the progress of all social undertakings and 
maintain social stability; and strive to fulfill major economic 
indicators set in the Eight Five-Year Plan one year ahead of 
schedule. The following are our concrete development targets: 
We have set the growth rate of the GNP at 11 percent and above. 
Primary industries are expected to grow by 7 percent; secondary 
industries, 15 percent, and tertiary industries, 12 percent. 
The total investment made by state-owned units in fixed assets 
will amount to 27.5 billion yuan, up by 17 percent, of which 
investment in infrastructural facilities totals 14.8 percent, 
registering an increase of 20.7 percent. Export volume will 
amount to $7 billion, while the amount of foreign funds actually 
used will reach $3.5 billion, up 16.7 percent. Financial 
revenue is expected to reach 11.8 billion yuan with a comparable 
growth rate of 11 percent. The total volume of retail sales 
will stand at 50.4 billion yuan, up by 20 percent, while price 
rises will be controlled at around 10 percent. The per capita 
income that urban dwellers use as living expenses and the per 
capita net income of peasants are both expected to grow by over 
13 percent. The natural growth rate of the population will be 
controlled below 12.59 per thousand. 
  In view of aforementioned guiding ideology and development 
targets, we need to pay special attention to work in the 
following 10 fields: 
<H5>  I. Center Around the Establishment of a Socialist Market </H5>
Economic Structure, and Further Deepen Reform in Every Field 
  This year, we are going to deepen economic structural reform 
in more fields than ever before and put forward the largest 
number of reform measures which are most intensified and most 
difficult to accomplish. Governments at all levels must make 
greater efforts to make breakthroughs in some key areas and, at 
the same time, press ahead with the whole project of 
establishing a socialist market economy, strengthen their 
leadership over reform, carefully guide implementation of reform 
measures, and made substantial headway in setting up a basic 
framework for the socialist market economic structure. 
  To successfully carry out reform in enterprises, we must 
further change their operational mechanisms and explore 
effective ways to establish a modern enterprise system. We will 
make good preparations for establishing a modern enterprise 
system; conscientiously carry out the "Enterprise Law," the 
"Regulations on Changing the Operational Mechanism of 
State-owned Large and Medium Enterprises," and the "Detailed 
Implementation Provisions" of the regulation; continue to deepen 
reform on the labor, personnel, and distribution systems of 
enterprises; and grant more decisionmaking power to enterprises. 
This year, operational autonomy will be granted in real terms 
to 300 state-owned enterprises across the province, supervision 
carried out on the state-owned assets of 30 key enterprises, and 
experiments conducted with the modern enterprise system in 50 
selected state-owned large and medium enterprises, among which 
five to 10 will experiment with the establishment of public 
corporations. We have selected the city of Nanping to conduct 
experiments with the modern enterprise system by carrying out 
comprehensive package reforms. State-owned commercial sectors 
and enterprises will continue to carry out reform of the 
state-owned and people-run system, while state-owned medium and 
small enterprises can be run under lease or under the 
share-holding system or even sold. We will make vigorous 
efforts to step up reform on the management system of state 
assets and strengthen and replenish relevant management organs. 
We will carry out experiments with the reform of assets 
management companies and property right exchange markets, and 
continue to appraise fixed assets and circulating funds, define 
the property right, and evaluate assets, thus preserving and 
increasing the value of state-owned assets. 
  In carrying out the fiscal and taxation reform, we must 
conscientiously implement the revenue-sharing system set for 
Fujian by the central authorities, step up the reform of 
financial management structure under the revenue-sharing system 
set for prefectures, cities, and counties by the provincial 
authorities, and restructure the financial management system. 
We will strive to take into consideration of the immediate 
interests of prefectures, cities, and counties to arouse 
enthusiasm of all levels in increasing income, reducing 
expenses, and managing finances well, and at the same time 
provide for increases of financial resources of provincial 
authorities, make flexible use of financial resources at the 
provincial level, and enhance the ability of the provincial 
authorities in exercising macroeconomic control and regulation. 
To make a success of fiscal and taxation reform, we should 
ensure that the new taxation and revenue-sharing systems can 
function normally. Meanwhile, we will actively reform the profit 
distribution system of state-owned enterprises, and make 
rational readjustments to and standardize profit distribution 
relations between the state and enterprises. 
  To reform the banking system, we should act in accordance 
with the requirements of the central authorities, accelerate the 
pace of changing the functions and role of people's banks, 
change the operational mechanism of specialized banks, and make 
all necessary preparations for establishing state policy banks 
on behalf of the state. We will create conditions for relevant 
state banking institutions to set up branches in Fujian, 
experiment with the establishment of urban and rural cooperative 
banks, and set up more credit cooperatives in both cities and 
the countryside. Efforts should be made to set up a unified 
banking market which allows only orderly and fair competition 
under strict management. We will reinforce the currency market, 
tighten control over interbank lending, and do a good job in 
issuing state bonds. We will continue to issue Fujian local 
enterprise bonds and trust beneficiary bonds, and conduct 
experiments with transferrable enterprise bonds. A good job 
needs to be done in issuing stocks to the public, thus 
standardizing the issuance, listing, and transactions of stocks. 
We will provide correct guidance for steady development of 
non-banking institutions, such as insurance, trust investment, 
and securities companies. The insurance industry should 
separate the operation of life insurance from that of non-life 
insurance, and we will see to it that the provincial life 
insurance company starts business as soon as possible. 
Supervision and management of the collection of export proceeds 
in foreign exchange should be reinforced to avoid any failure or 
delay in such collections. 
  To carry out the reform of the investment and financing 
structure, we should give full play to the role of the market in 
regulating investment and finance activities. It is important 
to reinforce the risk constraint mechanism for investment, and 
enhance the efficiency of investment. We will adopt a legal 
person responsibility system in all newly started construction 
projects to hold ourselves responsible for the whole process of 
these projects. Earnest efforts should be taken to strengthen 
control and regulation of the total amount and overall pattern 
of investment, reinforce the control and management of 
self-provided funds, and ensure that the investment structure is 
optimized and funds for key constructions guaranteed. We will 
adopt a systematic management method for fixed assets 
investment. Enterprises are responsible for investment in 
competitive projects, and they are required to raise funds 
through market channels and assume responsibility for the 
construction and management of such projects. The government 
will mainly take charge of infrastructural investment; it will 
pool financial and material forces from different sides, make 
investments through economic entities, and adopt a legal person 
responsibility system in these projects. Investment in public 
welfare projects will be mainly covered by the government's 
financial budgets. We should pay close attention to first-stage 
preparations of these investment projects, and see to it that 
more projects can be listed inthe state plan and greater capital 
support can be won from the State Development Bank. 
  To successfully carry out reform of the foreign trade 
system, 
we should persistently draw up unified policies, relax control 
over daily operations, carry out competition on an equal 
footing, be responsible for our own profits and losses, 
integrate industry with trade, and put into effect an agent 
system. Efforts will be made to accelerate reorganization of 
foreign-related economic and trade enterprises, revamp 30 
percent of foreign trade enterprises of various types into 
companies or share-holding companies with limited liability, and 
to complete reorganization of all foreign trade enterprises in 
three years. We will continue to grant import-export operations 
rights to qualified enterprises and scientific research 
institutions. A standardized distribution system will be 
adopted for rationed imported and exported commodities, and a 
strict supervision system of assets declaration and financial 
auditing set up in all enterprises located in overseas areas. 
We will help foreign trade enterprises of various types develop 
into industrialized international trade groups by means of joint 
investment, cooperation, joint operation, equity participation, 
and investment for redevelopment. To promote foreign trade to a 
new level, we will organize and set up a few more large-scale 
foreign trade groups which enjoy an annual export volume of over 
$100 million and an annual profit revenue of over 10 million 
yuan, as well as a number of transnational companies featuring 
integration of industry, agriculture, technology, and trade. 
  When carrying out reform on the social guarantee system, we 
should expand the coverage and scope of insurance and set up a 
perfect and unified social guarantee management system. It is 
important to reform and perfect the system of pension and 
unemployment insurance for workers and administrative staff in 
cities, carry out experiments with reform of the medical 
insurance system in more units, and establish an industrial 
accidents insurance system in all enterprises. Meanwhile, we 
will carry out experiments with a unified social guarantee 
management system in special economic zones as well as in cities 
and counties which have been selected for experiments with 
comprehensive reform packages. 
  Efforts will be made to 
expand the scope of unemployment insurance and gradually set up 
a unified unemployment insurance system which can cover 
enterprises of all categories. We should make good and flexible 
use of premium income, gradually adopt a double budgetary 
management system, and set up a rolling increment mechanism. 
The housing reform is focused on actively selling public 
houses, increasing their rental, establishing a housing 
provident fund system, carrying out the "project of comfortable 
homes" and the "project of grand mansions," and accelerating 
development and construction of economically appropriate houses. 
  Institutional reform should start from the provincial level 
and be carried through to all levels step by step. Organs at 
the provincial level will start institutional reform during the 
first half of this year, while different localities are required 
to start the reform during the latter half of the year. 
Meanwhile, we will put forward a reform program for organs at 
the county, township, and town levels, thus enabling them to 
complete institutional restructuring by the end of 1995. We 
will actively put into practice a civil service system, and 
basically try to set up this system in all government organs 
across the province before 1995. While pushing forward reform in 
all fields, we will continue to experiment with comprehensive 
reform packages of the new structure in a number of selected 
localities, and build the city of Quanzhou into a national-level 
experimental city with comprehensive reforms, and the Ningde 
Prefecture into a national-level comprehensive reform 
experimental prefecture focusing on promoting the aid-the-poor 
work through opening up, thus gaining useful experience for the 
reform of the entire province. 
<H5>  II. Focus on Stabilizing and Increasing Grain Output, and </H5>
Bring About a Comprehensive Development to the Rural Economy 
  Agriculture and the rural economy are the basis of the 
national economy and also a foundation stone for maintaining 
social stability. Governments at all levels should consistently 
place agriculture above everything else, continue to deepen 
rural reform, promote the comprehensive development of the rural 
economy in accordance with the requirement of "providing 
guidance, support, protection, and control and regulation," and 
ensure that agriculture can maintain stable growth, peasants can 
earn bigger incomes, and social stability remains sound in rural 
areas. 
  Special attention should be paid to grain production. This 
year, the total area sown to grain should stand at 30 million 
mu. It is important to expand the scope of interplanting, 
increase per-unit yields, and make sure that the total annual 
grain output exceeds 9 million tonnes. We will further mobilize 
the enthusiasm of peasants for grain growing, live up to all the 
promises made on grain purchases in relevant preferential 
policies, and refrain from applying preferential policies with 
some discount at different levels. The provincial authorities 
have decided to readjust this year's grain prices with a view to 
increasing the income of peasants. It is necessary to improve 
the system of stockpiling reserves and establish risk funds for 
grain production. We should conscientiously fulfill 
requirements put forward by provincial authorities for setting 
up a 200-million-yuan grain risk fund and setting aside 557,000 
tonnes of grain as reserves. Efforts will be taken to 
strengthen control and regulation of the grain market, and make 
sure that the task of purchasing 1.2 million tonnes of grain, 
which was set by provincial authorities, can be completed 
satisfactorily. We will continue to do a good job in production 
and supply of means of agricultural production and also in the 
distribution of agricultural loans. To stabilize prices of 
chemical fertilizers produced by small-scale factories, we have 
decided that preferential prices of electricity and coal used by 
these small factories will remain unchanged, and their tax 
exemptions will also remain in effect. While giving vigorous 
support to major grain-producing areas to help them stabilize 
and increase their grain output, we will actively promote a 
diversified economy and pay close attention to development of 
township and town enterprises to help increase the income of 
both grain growers and major grain-producing areas. We will 
give continued support to counties that are major producers of 
commodity grains and provide more funds and materials to these 
counties. We will see to it that all defaulted payments due to 
grain enterprises will be paid up, thus arousing enthusiasm of 
such enterprises for grain production. While stabilizing grain 
production, we will try to find more sources of foodstuffs 
through various channels and increase the total amount of 
foodstuffs to 800,000 tonnes. 
  Vigorous efforts will be made to develop a highly efficient 
type of farming that provides greater and better yields. We 
will adapt ourselves to the needs of the market, invigorate 
agriculture by applying scientific and technological advances 
and by promoting education, bring about development to all 
facets of agriculture, and enhance the comprehensive production 
capacity and the commercialization level of agriculture. It is 
imperative to readjust the pattern of planting and develop a 
number of high quality, well-known economic crops and 
fine-quality rice which enjoy high market demands and a 
relatively high economic value. 
  Focusing on the 
development of forestry, fruit, tea, and bamboo production, we 
will consolidate results already attained in afforestation, 
optimize the planting pattern of forestry, and develop a high 
quality green industry. It is expected that areas sown to 
fruits and tea will increase by 1 million mu and that to bamboo, 
by 500,000 mu, while 1 million mu of low-yield orchards and tea 
gardens will be transformed. Efforts will be made to develop 
production of poultry and livestock of fine breeds and to 
increase the supply of meat, poultry, eggs, and milk. We will 
pay close attention to the construction of "farmland on the 
sea," step up development of coastal areas and shoals, far-sea 
fishing, and fish breeding by means of nets and cases, and 
strive to increase output of aquatic products by 200,000 tonnes 
this year. It is imperative to set up a perfect system for the 
reproduction and spread of improved strains of agricultural 
products, actively introduce fine varieties and advanced 
agrotechniques from other parts of the country and the world, 
and do a good job in the research, assimilation, and spread of 
these improved varieties and advanced agrotechniques. A total 
of 10 provincial-level agricultural demonstration areas 
featuring high yields, fine quality, and high efficiency will be 
set up with a view to bringing along the development of 
thousands upon thousands of rural production units. We will 
make active use of preferential loans granted by the World Bank, 
the Asian Bank, and other foreign banks to promote an 
export-oriented agriculture. 
  Vigorous efforts will be made to push development of 
township 
and town enterprises to a new level. We will exert great 
efforts to develop rural shareholding cooperative enterprises in 
line with the principle of "making joint efforts in raising 
funds, sharing interests and accumulations, and undertaking 
risks together." Based on advantageous industries, products of 
famous brands, and pillar enterprises, a number of township and 
town enterprise groups will be established, thus enhancing scale 
efficiency as a whole. We will introduce funds, technologies, 
and management experience from outside China through various 
channels and means, and transform township and town enterprises 
and graft them to enterprises of other kinds. Qualified 
township and town enterprises will be granted import-export 
operations rights so that more enterprises can earn foreign 
exchange through exports. We will guide and support qualified 
township and town enterprises to concentrate their efforts on 
large-scale development, help them enhance their operational 
scale, level, and efficiency, and strive to attain a total 
annual output value of 150 billion yuan. 
  Efforts will be made to increase input into agriculture. 
Governments at all levels should gradually direct more state 
infrastructural investment, budgetary funds, and credit funds 
toward agricultural production, enhance the utilization 
efficiency of agricultural funds, and prevent any outflow and 
misappropriation of funds earmarked for agricultural production. 
We will fully mobilize all social forces, and increase input 
into agriculture through various channels and means. We will 
improve the profit deduction, reserve, and accumulation system 
of rural collective economic organizations, and see to it that 
the biggest part of collective accumulations are used for 
expanding reproduction. We will continue to promote water 
conservancy and basic farmland construction, thus improving the 
conditions of agricultural production. Unremitting efforts will 
be made to lighten the heavy burdens of peasants, absolutely 
abolish charges already banned by the central and provincial 
authorities, and never loose control over this issue. 
  We will continue to care about and support construction of 
old revolutionary bases, ethnic minority regions, remote areas, 
islands and islets, and poverty-stricken areas. It is important 
to institute a unit-to-unit aid-the-poor system, ensuring that 
aid-the-poor policies will remain unchanged and relevant funds 
stay intact. We will give guidance to different types of areas, 
organize and implement the "project of bringing benefits to the 
people," and, on a voluntary basis, resettle in newly built 
villages 100,000 poor people originally residing in remote 
mountain areas where natural conditions are harsh and there are 
no good prospects for future development. During the seven 
years from now to the year 2000, financial departments at both 
the provincial and prefectural (city) levels will allocate 3 
million yuan every year to subsidize the "project of bringing 
benefits to the people." Meanwhile, we will also reinforce 
construction of infrastructural facilities in poor areas and 
make every effort to improve the production and living 
conditions of poor areas. 
<H5>  Industrial Production </H5>
  This year's industrial production will continue to be 
focused 
on optimizing the industrial structure, strengthening 
management, and enhancing economic efficiency. Governments at 
all levels should pay close attention to work in the industrial 
field, and ensure that industrial production can maintain rapid 
growth on the basis of improved economic performance. 
  Continued efforts will be made to optimize the industrial 
structure. We will work out a detailed plan for readjusting 
both the industrial structure and the product mix in line with 
industrial policies and market demands. 
  It is imperative to 
give key support to development of such industries as 
petrochemistry, electronics, machinery, light and textile 
products, forestry, building materials, and metallurgy, and to 
successfully organize the production of famous brand industrial 
products, which are highly competitive both inside and outside 
the country and enjoy apparently good prospects for further 
development. Provincial-level industrial enterprises will focus 
their attention on developing products which "rank among the 
country's best," while those at the prefectural and city levels 
will put their emphasis on the development of products "ranking 
among the province's best." We will make every effort to 
achieve the goal of "three 100's," that is, we will try our 
utmost to reach the goal by 1995 that 100 enterprises can attain 
an annual output value of over 100 million yuan, 100 enterprises 
can enjoy a total amount of revenue taxes and profits exceeding 
15 million yuan, and 100 enterprises can earn over 50 million 
yuan from delivery of exported goods. We will continue to 
readjust the organizational structure of enterprises; make use 
of market competition mechanisms by which the efficient prosper 
while the inefficient are eliminated, and close down, suspend 
production, merge, or transform the functions of enterprises 
which have been long plagued by unmarketable and slow-moving 
goods. Guided by production of fine-quality, famous brand or 
highly competitive products, we will rely on large and medium 
pillar enterprises, organize transregional and transdepartmental 
cooperation for specialized production, set up lateral ties with 
other parts of the country, and guide enterprises to seek 
further development by means of annexation. To enhance scale 
efficiency in enterprises, we will organize and establish 
enterprise groups from a high starting point and build them into 
export-oriented specialized conglomerates with distinctive 
features. 
  Earnest efforts should be made to reinforce management of 
enterprises. We will extensively carry out the activity of 
"changing operational mechanisms, reinforcing management, 
improving professional skills, and enhancing economic 
efficiency" with a view to enhancing the overall quality of 
enterprises. We will vigorously adopt modern management methods 
in enterprises, focus our attention on implementation of "two 
regulations," strengthen financial control of enterprises, 
reduce consumption levels and production costs, accelerate 
circulation of funds, and improve the efficiency of capital 
circulation. It is necessary to improve internal management 
mechanisms of enterprises, speed up reforms of their personnel, 
employment, and salary systems, and fully mobilize the 
enthusiasm of all workers and staff of enterprises. Efforts will 
be made to perfect quality control systems and enhance the 
competitiveness of products in the market. It is important to 
step up the marketing and sales of products, provide 
satisfactory follow-up services, and raise production and sales 
rates of our products. Measures will be adopted to reinforce 
prevention of disasters and damage and to minimize losses of 
state property incurred by accidents of various types. 
  Vigorous efforts will be taken to step up technological 
progress in enterprises. This year's investment in the 
technological transformation of state-owned industrial 
enterprises is expected to reach 4.5 billion yuan, up by 25 
percent over last year, of which 2.73 billion yuan will be 
invested in 26 key projects. Priority will be given to 
technical transformation of transportation, energy, postal and 
telecommunications industries, and raw and semi-finished 
materials industry, the technical transformation of highly 
efficient state above-the-line projects, and to a number of 
state key projects using new and high technologies introduced 
from abroad. It is important to vigorously develop new 
products, spread the use of new technologies, and focus our 
efforts on 30 development projects which are highly competitive 
and can bring along the development of all other enterprises to 
engage in technical cooperation of various forms with 
universities, colleges, and scientific research institutions, so 
new and high technologies can be extensively commercialized and 
applied to production. 
<H5>  IV. Focus on Energy and Transportation, and Accelerate the </H5>
Construction of Infrastructural Facilities 
  Making a success of infrastructural construction is not only 
an important task in accelerating the modernization drive, but 
also a key link in Fujian's efforts to ease bottleneck 
restrictions and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national 
economic development. While continuing to keep control over the 
scale of fixed assets investment, we will make every effort to 
optimize the investment pattern, and put the focus of investment 
on the construction of infrastructural facilities in the fields 
of transportation, power, and telecommunications. This year, 
the provincial authorities plan to invest 27.5 billion yuan in 
Fujian's infrastructural construction, representing an increase 
of 17 percent over last year's figure. A total of 30 large and 
medium projects have been arranged, 21 of which are involved in 
transportation and power production. 
  To improve our 
transportation facilities, we have made plans to build a new 
international airport, the Fuzhou Changle International Airport, 
continue construction of the Hennan and Zhangquanxiao railways, 
engage in second-phase construction of the Fuzhou New and Xiamen 
Dongdu ports, and start construction of the multi-purpose 
Zhangzhou port. Meanwhile, we will pay close attention to 
implementation of the "pioneer project," and unfold the overall 
construction of the Quanzhou-Xiamen section of the Fuzhou-Xiamen 
expressway. To boost power production, we will continue 
construction of the Shuikou hydroelectric station, the Xiamen 
Songyu power plant, and the no. 2 Zhangzhou power plant; try to 
start construction of the Mianhuatan and Muyangxi terraced 
hydroelectric stations; and strive to increase generating 
capacity by over 1 million kw this year. As regards 
telecommunications, we will pay close attention to construction 
of a key long-distance telecommunications project in Fuzhou and 
try to install 800,000 more program-controlled telephones across 
the province this year. In the field of water conservancy, we 
will continue construction of a key water conservancy project in 
Shanzai, Lianjiang; a water supply project on the northern bank 
of the Meizhou Bay; and a diversion works on the Min Jiang in 
Fuqing. Moreover, plans have been drawn up for construction of 
a water supply project on the southern bank of the Meizhou Bay. 
To improve our infrastructural facilities, we will continue 
construction of the Fujian oil refinery, the Shaowu bamboo pulp 
factory, and the expansion project of the Qingzhou paper mill, 
and make plans to start a number of new projects, including the 
Gonglongyan Prefectural paper mill and the Sande cement factory. 
Governments and departments at all levels should take into 
consideration the interests of the whole, strengthen 
coordination and management, promptly solve problems and 
difficulties that may crop up during construction, and ensure 
that all key projects, which have a great bearing on the overall 
economic development of the whole province, can start 
immediately and bring about economic returns at an early date. 
We will make continued efforts to raise construction funds 
through various channels and means, see to it that large-scale 
key infrastructural construction projects can be listed into the 
state's 1995-2010 development program, and make every effort to 
obtain loans for long-term development. Meanwhile, we will also 
try our utmost to secure loans from the World Bank, the Asia 
Bank, and other international financial institutions. It is 
important to adopt the practice of establishing project 
companies and shareholding companies with limited liability, and 
attract diversified economic elements to participate in 
construction of infrastructural facilities. We will reinforce 
management over infrastructural construction projects, pay close 
attention to first-stage preparation of these projects, and make 
sure that they can be started whenever conditions have matured. 
We will put into practice the system of public bidding for 
construction projects and a supervision system for the 
construction process, so that we can ensure that all projects 
under construction can be completed on schedule on the basis of 
fine quality and high efficiency. 
<H5>  V. Open Fujian Wider to the Outside World in Line With the </H5>
Requirement for Upgrading, Expanding, and Deepening Opening up 
  New breakthroughs should be made this year in attracting and 
utilizing foreign investment. We will give better guidance to 
the utilization of foreign investment, expand the scale of 
project reserves, and grant preferential policies to foreign 
investors to direct foreign investment mainly to projects of 
basic industries and infrastructural facilities, including 
ports, power production, airports, and highways, as well as to 
developmental agricultural projects and projects of transforming 
old enterprises. We will make every effort to encourage 
different industries and trades, such as banking, retailing, and 
tourist industries, to make more use of foreign investment. It 
is necessary to introduce more projects using advanced 
technologies and which can earn foreign exchange through 
exports. We will pay close attention to the coordination of 
major projects using foreign funds, simplify administrative 
procedures, provide better services, reinforce management, and 
ensure that more contracts on projects using foreign funds can 
be fulfilled, more contractual capital can be put into actual 
use, and more projects can start construction. 
  Vigorous efforts will be made to expand exports and foreign 
trade. We will continue to uphold the strategy of developing a 
pluralistic market, and open up new markets on a constant basis. 
We should seize current favorable opportunities brought by the 
new round of the foreign trade structural reform, continue 
implementing supportive measures and policies, extensively 
arouse the enthusiasm state-owned foreign trade enterprises of 
all types at all levels for expanding the scale of exports, 
improve day-to-day operations, and earn more foreign exchange 
through exports. It is important to give better play to the 
advantages of foreign-invested enterprises in expanding exports, 
and to continue to encourage the establishment of more 
export-oriented foreign-invested enterprises. We will do a good 
job in examining and approving import-export operations rights 
which are to be granted to productive enterprises, scientific 
and technological units, commercial materials enterprises, and 
large-scale township and town enterprises; give better guidance, 
support, and supervision to enterprises which have already 
obtained autonomy in handling import-export operations; and 
actively encourage them to undertake export tasks assigned by 
the state and try their best to play a part in increasing the 
foreign exchange revenue of the state. We will develop 
production of export commodities in light of market demands and 
readjust the mix of export commodities. It is imperative to 
provide enterprises with more information and consultative 
services; vigorously support enterprises to reinvigorate their 
export business by means of exchange, tax, and interest rates, 
and to improve management and supervision of product quality to 
enhance the quality of exported commodities. 
  A good job needs to be done in handling overseas Chinese 
affairs. We will further close ties with overseas Chinese and 
all Chinese residing in foreign countries, give full play to the 
forces of overseas Chinese, and through them try to introduce 
more funds, technology, and able personnel from overseas areas. 
We will vigorously promote economic and trade cooperation with 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. Proceeding from the interests of 
the whole under the principle of "peace and unification, and one 
country, two systems," we will continue to consolidate and 
promote existing economic and trade ties with Hong Kong and 
Macao, pay close attention to promoting economic and trade 
exchanges with Taiwan, and do a good job of attracting Taiwan 
investment and boosting Taiwan-bound exports. 
  Continued efforts will be made to promote economic and 
technological cooperation with foreign countries. We will 
further perfect macro-management mechanisms for construction 
projects contracted abroad and the export of labor services. It 
is imperative to reinforce management over enterprises located 
in overseas areas and to adopt a contracted responsibility 
system in these enterprises with a view to enhancing their 
economic performance. On the basis of consolidating the 
existing labor market, we will try to open up markets in 
Southeast Asian countries, Japan, and South Korea through 
various channels. Strides will be taken to promote 
international tourism as well as scientific and cultural 
exchanges with foreign countries. 
<H5>  VI. Increase Income and Economize on Spending and Do a </H5>
Good Job in Handling Financial and Taxation Work 
  This year, we are faced with arduous tasks in maintaining a 
balance between financial revenue and expenditure. To 
successfully fulfill these tasks, we need to vigorously open up 
new financial sources and increase financial revenue. Under the 
prerequisite of fulfilling the task of increasing revenue set by 
the central authorities, we will make careful studies and 
analyses of tax items which are under the jurisdiction of local 
governments, ensuring that we can not only expand existing 
financial sources, but also open up and cultivate new financial 
sources on a regular basis. In line with the unified 
arrangements of the central authorities, we will pay close 
attention to establishing tax organs under the central and local 
authorities, reinforce control and management of tax collection, 
collect taxes and give exemptions according to the law, and 
prevent any possible losses of state's tax revenue. While 
establishing a tax declaration system in all sectors, we will 
actively put into practice an agent system by which intermediary 
organs, such as accounting and auditing firms and tax 
consultation institutions, can act as agents in handling tax 
affairs. As a result, a mechanism will take shape under which 
taxpayers, tax-handling agents, and tax collection authorities 
can exercise restrictive functions on each other. In line with 
the principle of keeping expenditures within the limits of 
income, we will make rational readjustments to the expenditure 
structure, exercise strict management of the budget, refrain 
from making a deficit budget or rashly putting up 
establishments, absolutely put brakes on irrational spending, 
and ensure a balanced financial revenue and expenditure. 
<H5>  VII. Take Earnest Measures to Control Commodity Prices and </H5>
Further Enliven Market Circulation 
  Keeping commodity prices at a basically stable level is not 
only an important condition for smoothly carrying out reform and 
construction, but also a vital issue in maintaining social 
stability. Governments at all levels should regard as an 
important task keeping commodity prices under control. Under 
the prerequisite of giving full consideration of the tolerance 
of different sectors of the society, we should appropriately 
push forward price reform, continue to carry out a 
responsibility system with specific price- control targets, and 
make sure that the system can be put into practice at every 
level. Special attention should be paid to the "shopping basket 
project," successfully building up production bases of 
non-staple foodstuffs, and increasing effective supplies. The 
"shopping basket project" will be regarded one part of the job 
responsibility system for mayors and appraisals made on the work 
results of mayors every year. Governments at all levels across 
the province should allocate a total of 100 million yuan as 
price subsidies to support the "shopping basket project." To 
maintain a normal price order, it is important to strengthen 
management and supervision over prices of market commodities, 
keep watch over prices of 50 daily necessity goods and services 
of nine categories, including grain, cooking oil, meat, poultry, 
eggs, aquatic products, fresh vegetables, condiments, milk and 
dairy products, and household groceries, put goods on sale and 
provide services with prices and charges clearly marked, conduct 
general inspections over price rises, put an end to the 
practices of price discrimination and frauds, and hand down 
punishment according to the law on those who wantonly raise 
prices or exceed their power to charge more for their services. 
We must see to it that price rises for the year are controlled 
at about 10 percent, while the prices of daily necessities and 
services are controlled within the limits of tolerance of the 
majority. 
  We will make greater efforts to deepen reform of the 
circulation structure and do a good job of building markets. 
While trying our best to complete and put into operation 20 
large-scale commercial networks as scheduled, we will also set 
up 20 self-contained, multi-functional regional wholesale 
markets for agricultural and sideline products in a number of 
prefectures and cities, including Fuzhou and Xiamen, establish 
20 well-organized large-scale industrial products wholesale 
markets which mainly rely on highly competitive products, and 
develop a number of rural and border trade fairs. Vigorous 
efforts will be made to open up rural markets and to send to and 
sell marketable goods in rural areas with a view to satisfying 
the demands of the vast numbers of peasants. It is important to 
perfect supervision and management methods of the market, firmly 
abolish and ban sham and shoddy commodities, and ensure that 
business deals and competition can be carried out on an equal 
footing. 
<H5>  VIII. Based on Well-Coordinated Economic and Social </H5>
Development, Vigorously Push Forward Progress in Science and 
Technology and Other Social Undertakings 
  The development of social undertakings is an important 
aspect 
of the socialist modernization drive, and also a significant 
guarantee for the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and 
economic construction. To put an end to the current relatively 
backward state of Fujian's social undertakings, we must continue 
to implement the "Decision on Accelerating Reform and 
Development of Social Undertakings," and make all social 
undertakings flourish. 
  To boost scientific and technological work, we need to 
firmly 
establish the concept that science and technology are primary 
productive forces, continue to carry out in depth the principle 
of "relying on and gearing ourselves to the needs of the 
masses," provide good services for the main battlefield of 
economic construction, develop industries using new and high 
technologies, and reinforce basic research, thus closely 
integrating science and technology with the economy. In line 
with the principle of "concentrating on scientific and 
technological research and at the same time encouraging the 
commercialization of research results," we will step up the 
institutional reform of scientific research institutions, 
accelerate the pace of structural readjustment and personnel 
divisions, and gradually set up a modernized research and 
development system which features optimized structures, a 
rational setup, high efficiency, and great vitality. We will 
integrate production with scientific studies and research, speed 
up commercialization and industrialization of scientific and 
technological results, try to fulfill in a comprehensive way all 
targets and tasks set in the "rejuvenation program," 
successfully organize "10 major provincial-level scientific and 
technological research projects," concentrate our energy on 
running the Fuzhou and Xiamen new- and high-tech industrial 
development zones well, step up efforts to transform traditional 
industries with new and high technologies, and give support to 
developing a number of enterprises and enterprise groups using 
new and high technologies, which can attain an annual output 
value of over 100 million yuan. We will organize special forces 
to tackle a number of key technical problems in scientific 
research and certain scientific fields which are closely related 
to economic development. It is important to strengthen 
agrotechnical work, thus providing a scientific and 
technological backing for future agricultural development. 
Special attention will be paid to the research and spread of 
improved varieties, give play to the special features of these 
improved varieties, put them into scale production, and enhance 
their economic returns. We should score substantive results in 
"rejuvenating marine production through applications of 
scientific and technological advances," make breakthroughs in 
marine breeding skills, develop a number new skills and 
techniques in the manufacture, extraction, and processing of 
living marine resources, marine medicines, and marine health 
foods, and accelerate the transformation and development of 
marine industries. 
  To promote education, we should further carry out in depth 
the "Outline of China's Educational Reform and Development" and 
the "Law on Teachers," administer education according to the 
law, enhance the quality of education as a whole, and strive to 
build Fujian into one of the best provinces in providing 
education. We will speed up the pace of basically making 
universal the nine-year compulsory education, expand the scale 
of junior middle schools, and see to it that more graduates of 
higher primary schools are able to continue their studies in 
junior middle schools. We will strive to spread elementary 
compulsory education to 100 percent of our population, and 
secondary compulsory education to over 72 percent of the 
population. This year, we will take more effective measures to 
eliminate illiteracy, try to realize the goal of turning 200,000 
people into literate persons, enhance the literacy level of 
310,000 people, and bring the illiteracy rate down to 5 percent 
or lower among young and middle-aged people. Efforts will be 
made to strengthen senior middle school, as well as preschool 
and special education. We will vigorously develop vocational 
and technical, adult, and televised education of various forms, 
continue to implement the plan of training 1 million 
peasant-technicians, and accelerate the pace of developing all 
kinds of specialized technical personnel and skilled laborers 
who suit the needs of economic construction. 
  Educational 
reform should focus on readjusting the structure of education 
and enhancing both the quality of education and school-running 
efficiency. It is important to continue carrying out 
comprehensive reform of higher, rural, and urban education. 
Experiments with self-financed studies should be conducted in 
colleges and universities. We will continue to carry out reform 
at Yangen University, and make good preparations for the 
establishment of Jimei University and Yuanhong College. 
Governments at all levels should increase input into education 
in real terms, try to solve more practical problems, and make 
more solid accomplishments in the educational sector by 
economizing on spending in other fields. We will persistently 
raise educational funds through various channels, and vigorously 
encourage our citizens, people from all walks of life, overseas 
Chinese, and compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, to run 
schools in Fujian or to make donations to schools across the 
province. We will advocate the sound general practice of 
respecting teachers and education, care about the working and 
living conditions of the vast numbers of teachers, and set up a 
guarantee mechanism by which teachers can receive their full 
salary on time without worrying about any defaults of payment. 
While actively developing able personnel, we will also pay 
attention to introducing and making rational use of them, 
striving to create an environment and conditions under which 
people of talent who can give full display of their talents and 
skills come forth in large numbers. 
  The focus of public health should be on rural areas. We will 
continue to carry out plans for building rural medical care 
stations and epidemic prevention stations, maternity and child 
care centers, and township and town hospitals; consolidate and 
develop the medical treatment, epidemic prevention, and health 
care networks at the county, township, and village levels; 
concentrate our efforts on building a number of township and 
town central hospitals; and develop and perfect cooperative 
medical systems of various forms. We will continue to carry out 
activities to create advanced cities and county towns in 
promoting public health and do a good job in the rural patriotic 
health campaign which mainly features transformation and 
enhancement of water and toilet facilities. Medical workers in 
urban areas should constantly improve their medical skills, 
adopt sound medical work styles, and provide patients with 
services of the best quality. We will accelerate reform of the 
medical and health care system, gradually perfect management of 
the free medical service system in urban areas, and work out 
appropriate contributions respectively borne by financial 
departments, units, and individuals. It is important to 
reinforce medical supervision and inspection, take earnest 
measures to prevent and control epidemic, local, and 
occupational diseases, focus our efforts on eliminating the 
disease of polio as well as diseases caused by insufficient 
iodine, and consolidate results we have already attained in the 
prevention of snail fever. Efforts will be done to rejuvenate 
traditional Chinese medicine. We will do a good job in building 
demonstration colleges of traditional Chinese medicine, and 
actively and steadily experiment with both the appraisal of 
hospitals and the leveled management of traditional Chinese 
medical hospitals. Further efforts will be made to strengthen 
our control over production and sale of pharmaceuticals. 
  To promote our cultural undertakings, we must adhere to the 
principles of "serving the people and the cause of socialism" 
and of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of 
thoughts contend," continue to organize the implementation of 
the "project of a hundred flowers" and the "project of fragrant 
grass," actively advocate literature and art works of noble 
taste, make literature and art creation flourish, and at the 
same time, strictly ban and wipe out all harmful works from the 
cultural market. It is imperative to strengthen cultural work 
at the grass-roots level, namely in enterprises, schools and 
universities, and rural areas, enliven the cultural life of both 
urban and rural residents, and strive to make a success of the 
second session of Fujian Art Festival. Efforts will be made to 
promote sports. Athletes are required to make good preparations 
for the eighth national meet, step up training, and strive for 
better results in competitions. It is necessary to carry out 
mass sports activities on an extensive scale and to encourage 
counties to turn themselves into national-level advanced sports 
counties of the fifth batch. Greater efforts will be taken to 
promote the undertakings of radio and television and to provide 
the vast numbers of the masses with healthy and colorful 
entertainment programs. We will build up more satellite up-link 
stations, set up cable television networks in all counties 
across the province, and constantly expand the population 
reached by radio and television. We should pay close attention 
to the work of the press and publishing, provide the media with 
a correct opinion guide, enhance the overall quality of 
publications, and do a good job in the examination and appraisal 
of fine literature works published by publication funds. We 
will run archives well, pay attention to exploring information 
sources, and accelerate the modernization pace of archives 
management. A good job needs to be done in compiling and 
editing local annals, and the pace of compilation should be 
expedited. 
  XI. Uphold Basic National Policy, Exercise 
Population Control, Strengthen Protection of Environmental 
Resources, and Make Rational Use of Land 
  Governments at all levels should unswervingly pay close 
attention to family planning, and see to it that existing birth 
control policies, fixed population control targets, and the 
practice by which principal party and government leaders take 
personal charge of family planning work remain unchanged. 
Fujian has successfully fulfilled the state's birth control 
tasks for three consecutive years. To consolidate this 
accomplishment, we will continue to further perfect the 
management responsibility system with specific targets on 
population control and family planning, strictly implement the 
"Regulations of Fujian Province on Family Planning," focus our 
attention on the birth control of rural and floating 
populations, strengthen family planning work at the grass-roots, 
especially the village, level, carry out propaganda and 
education among and provide services for the masses, and ensure 
that Fujian's birth rate continues to be controlled below 18.59 
per thousand. Meanwhile, we will attach great importance to 
environmental protection. At present, Fujian's environmental 
protection falls far behind its economic development, and some 
localities are still engaged in creating waste water, waste gas, 
industrial residues, and noise. To counter such a situation, 
governments at all levels should bring environmental protection 
into their economic and social development programs in real 
terms, adopt a strict responsibility system with specific 
targets, and regard the results of environmental protection as 
one of major aspects of the appraisal work of governments. We 
will further reinforce education and propaganda on environmental 
protection and enhance the awareness of the people of the entire 
province, especially cadres at all levels, of the need to 
protect the environment. In accordance with the law, we will 
conduct strict evaluations on newly built, transformed, and 
expanded projects to see if they pose serious hazards to the 
environment, and, at the sametime, require that affiliated 
environmental protection facilities be designed, built, and put 
into use together with these projects. We will intensify 
environmental supervision and management, focus our attention on 
prevention and control of pollution incurred by township and 
town enterprises as well as by foreign-invested enterprises, 
place emphasis on the comprehensive control of the "four pests," 
and bring Fujian's overall environment more in line with its 
economic construction. We will deepen reform of the land use 
system, strengthen management of the first-grade land market, 
put into practice across the province the system of compensated 
sales of land use right with limited terms, gradually increase 
the proportion of land leases, perfect approval procedures of 
land leases, and enhance the transparency of compensated land 
sales. We will treasure every inch of arable land, strengthen 
farmland protection, institute a system on establishing basic 
farmland protection zones, firmly ban the practice of leaving 
farmland uncultivated, keep strict control over the occupancy of 
farmland for non-agricultural uses, vigorously develop farmland 
reserve resources, such as waste hills and shoals, and strive to 
increase the total sown area by 40,000 mu this year. 
<H5>  X. Earnestly Strengthen Building of Socialist Spiritual </H5>
Civilization, Democracy, and the Legal System on the Basis of 
Maintaining Social Stability and Progress 
  We will attach great importance to the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization. Vigorous efforts will be made to 
strengthen ideological and ethical education, unremittingly 
conduct education on the party's basic theories and basic line, 
step up study, propaganda, and education of the theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, give wide 
publicity to the 64-character pioneering spirit advocated by 
Comrade Jiang Zemin, guide the vast numbers of party members, 
cadres, and masses to enhance their senses of self-respect, 
self-confidence, and self-improvement, help them establish 
correct ideologies, beliefs, as well as outlooks on life and 
value, and enhance their ability to guard against the corrosive 
influences of various kinds of decadent ideologies and to remove 
various kinds of obstructions. We will continue to carry out 
the activity of creating civilized units in both urban and rural 
areas, consolidate and promote results we have already attained 
in the mass building of spiritual civilization, and give form to 
a healthy and sound general mood in the society. It is 
important to reinforce civil administration work, and do a good 
job in giving special care to and resettling disabled servicemen 
and families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, in 
providing disaster relief, and in giving mutual social aid. We 
will make every effort to enhance the awareness of the whole 
people of the need for national defense, reinforce the building 
of the militia and reserve services, continue to do a good job 
in giving "dual support," and consolidate and promote unity 
between the army and the government and between the army and the 
people. 
  Vigorous efforts will be made to push forward the building 
of socialist democracy and the legal system. We will develop a 
democratic style of work, and protect the rights of the masses 
as masters of the country. Governments at all levels should 
voluntarily subject themselves to the supervision of people's 
congresses and their standing committees, and give full play to 
the roles of the local CPPCC committees, democratic parties, 
mass bodies, and non-party personages in providing political 
consultation and democratic supervision. We will 
conscientiously implement the party's policies on nationalities 
and religions, and make every effort to provide correct guidance 
to nationality and religious work. It is important to 
strengthen the building of the legal system, and pay close 
attention to formulating laws, rules, and regulations which are 
closely related to the socialist market economy. We will 
reinforce and improve supervision over judicial and 
law-enforcement work,; persistently administer the government 
according to the law, and put an absolute end to the tendency to 
ignore laws, neither observing nor enforcing them to the letter, 
as well as failure to punish lawbreakers according to the law. 
It is necessary to set up and develop special legal service 
organs, carry out in depth education on the legal system, and 
enhance the legal concept of the whole people. 
  Efforts will be made to improve all facets of public 
security. Leading cadres at all levels should regard the task of 
maintaining social order as one of the work targets during their 
tenure of office, gradually establish a work mechanism of 
rewards and punishments, constantly explore new ways to improve 
public security under the new situation, and carry through 
measures for comprehensive rectification of public security down 
to the grass- roots level. We will continue to increase the 
intensity of the crackdown campaign, promptly hand down heavy 
punishments to offenders for various serious crimes according to 
the law, and carry out in depth the struggles of "eliminating 
six evils" and of "wiping out pornographic activities." Strides 
will be taken to strengthen coastal defense, deal severe blows 
to smuggling, and make every effort to stop illegal immigration 
activities. We will correctly handle contradictions among the 
people, do a good job in dealing with letters and visits of the 
masses, mediate disputes among them in a timely manner, and 
protect against possible troubles. We will strictly administer 
police forces, and constantly enhance the political and 
professional qualities of the judicial contingent. 
  We will carry out the struggle against corruption in a 
thoroughgoing, sustained, and more effective way. In line with 
the two "five-point stipulations" set out by the central 
authorities, we will urge leading cadres to remain honest and 
clean and make self- criticism when carrying out their official 
duties. We will continue to pay close attention to 
investigating and dealing with major cases which involve the 
abuse of power for personal gain, graft and bribery, practicing 
favoritism, perverting justice for bribes, and dereliction of 
duties. Persons who have degenerated and violated the law or 
rules of discipline must be punished unsparingly according to 
the law. It is important to increase the intensity of 
eliminating unhealthy practices, such as arbitrarily collecting 
fees and overseas travel at the expenses of the state, and urge 
party and government organs to sever their links with 
enterprises and commercial sectors. We will make every effort 
to perfect the legal system, set up an effective mechanism of 
supervision and restriction, guard against and eliminate corrupt 
practices by establishing strict systems, and ensure that new 
results can be scored at the present phase of the 
anti-corruption campaign. 
  Fellow Deputies, 
  This year is the fourth year since we started to carry out 
the Eighth Five-Year Plan. Generally speaking, we did a good 
job in implementing the Eighth Five-Year Plan during the first 
three years, and this year we can expect to fulfill all major 
tasks set out in the plan one year ahead of time. In light of 
the implementation of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, as well as the 
current economic development trend, provincial authorities have 
called many meetings to study a development strategy for the 
Ninth Five-Year Plan period as well as the first decade of the 
next century. The following is our tentative plan: To improve 
the economic structure, we will further deepen reform, 
vigorously cultivate the main body of a pluralistic market, 
perfect the market system, improve macroeconomic control and 
regulation as well as the social guarantee system, give play to 
the basic regulatory roles of the market mechanism, and provide 
economic development with a strong motive power. To optimize 
the economic structure, we will give full play to the advantages 
of Hong Kong and Taiwan and engage in large-scale 
infrastructural construction; while transforming and tapping the 
production potentials of existing enterprises, try to cultivate 
new economic growth points, give rise to new pillar industries, 
including petrochemistry, machinery and electronics, light and 
textile industries, and biological engineering, develop an 
export- oriented economy, and accelerate development of tertiary 
industries, thus bringing about a leap forward in Fujian's 
economy. To promote development of the region, we will expedite 
exploration of southeastern Fujian, and turn it into a 
prosperous area west of the Taiwan Straits, thus bringing about 
the joint development of both mountain and coastal areas in 
Fujian. As regards the economic growth rate, we expect that the 
GNP will grow by 11 percent during the Ninth Five-Year Plan and 
by 10 percent in the decade afterwards. 
  According to this 
tentative development plan, during the Ninth Five-Year Plan 
period, Fujian will basically set up a socialist market economic 
structure, and fulfill the plan of doubling the GNP for the 
third time; and our people will attain a fairly comfortable life 
ahead of schedule. By the year 2010, that is, 10 years after 
the Ninth Five-Year Plan, Fujian's socialist market economic 
structure will become more mature and perfect; an advanced 
transportation and telecommunications system and a reliable 
energy guarantee system will be set up; most areas, led by 
southeastern part of the province, will basically realize their 
goals of modernization. In that case, Fujian will rank among 
the best provinces of the country in general economic quantity, 
per capita income, and major indicators of social development, 
and the living standards of people in Fujian will reach the 
level of moderately advanced countries. By that time, a more 
prosperous and civilized Fujian will stand like a giant on the 
southeastern coast of our motherland. To make this strategic 
goal come true, the people of the whole province should forge 
ahead with full confidence. 
  Fellow Deputies, 
  It is a great historic task of the new period to establish a 
socialist market economic structure and to accelerate the pace 
of the modernization drive. Therefore, it is the scared 
responsibility of governments at all levels to unite, guide, and 
organize the people of the entire province to fulfill this grand 
yet arduous task. To smoothly accomplish the tasks of reform, 
development, and stability, we must take earnest measures to 
improve the self- building of the government, constantly enhance 
the political, ideological, ethic, and professional qualities of 
government functionaries, and meet new challenges with a new 
attitude. 
  Firstly, we must promote unity and work with concerted 
efforts. In the past, we relied on the strength of unity to 
attain glorious accomplishments in reform, opening up, and 
economic construction. Today, to strive for new victories in 
reform, development, and stability, we need all the more to hold 
high the banner of unity and cooperation, unite all forces that 
can be united, mobilize all positive factors, give good 
guidance, protection, and play to the enthusiasm of the vast 
numbers of cadres and masses, and try hard to create a political 
situation of unity, harmony, stability, and progress. 
Governments at all levels should take into consideration the 
interests of the whole, place the interests of the party and 
country above everything else, and appropriately handle 
relations between higher and lower levels, between departments, 
inside leading bodies, and among leading bodies of different 
fields. Government workers at both the higher and lower levels 
should help each other and work in coordination. Different 
departments should establish the concept of "playing the same 
game of chess," work with concerted efforts, and give play to 
their functions and role as a whole. Leading bodies and comrades 
in different fields should respect, understand, support, and 
help each other. Governments at all levels should safeguard the 
party's leadership, voluntarily subject themselves to the 
supervision of people's congresses at all levels and their 
standing committees, tighten ties with the CPPCC, democratic 
parties, mass bodies, and people from all walks of life, and 
give better play to their roles in participating in government 
and political affairs and in exercising democratic supervision. 
By so doing, our modernization cause can unify forces from all 
sides, and can advance with great vitality. 
  Secondly, we need to change work styles and carry out our 
work in a down-to-earth manner. It is important to advocate 
more study and less entertainments, more investigations and less 
subjective conjecture, and more solid work and less empty talks. 
These three points are of vital significance to our efforts to 
improve the work style of leaders. Leading cadres at all levels 
should go to the forefront of reform and construction, carry out 
careful investigations and studies, acquaint themselves with the 
overall situation at the grass-roots level, actively explore new 
ways to promote reform and development, and appropriately solve 
all kinds of complicated social contradictions that may crop up. 
Governments at all levels should proceed from meeting the needs 
of the socialist market economic structure, act in accordance 
with the principle of separating functions of the government 
from those of enterprise, and place the focus of the 
government's functions on making unified plans, formulating 
policies, providing information and guidance, organizing 
coordinated actions, providing services, and conducting 
supervision and inspection. Departments at all levels should 
give play to their new functions, further enhance their sense of 
dedication and responsibility, remain industrious in their work, 
and improve their work efficiency. Leaders at all levels should 
maintain close ties with the masses, care about the difficulties 
and problems of the masses, earnestly protect the legitimate 
rights and interests of the masses, and try hard to accomplish 
more solid work for the masses. Continued efforts will be taken 
to deal with the 15 tasks set by the provincial party committee 
and government which are closely related to the daily life and 
production of the masses, thus winning the trust and support of 
the masses of the people. 
  Third, we must make conscientious studies and enhance our 
quality. Leading cadres at all levels should conscientiously 
study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, especially the third volume of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," grasp the essence of Deng 
Xiaoping's works, apply theories to practical work, and 
constantly enhance their work efficiency and decisionmaking 
ability. Meanwhile, they also need to read more books on the 
theory and basic concepts of the market economy, and learn and 
master more knowledge about modern economics, science and 
technology, laws, and society, with a view to widening their 
vision and enhancing their leadership skills. 
  Fourth, we should remain honest and clean when carrying out 
official duties, and engage in hard struggles. Government 
functionaries at all levels should bear in mind the party's 
principle of serving the people wholeheartedly, place the 
interests of the people before everything else at all times, and 
regard it as a basic work requirement to build a clean and 
industrious administration. Leading cadres at all levels should 
remain clean and honest, rouse themselves for vigorous efforts 
to make the country prosperous, and exercise good control of 
power on behalf of the people. It is important to carry forward 
the pioneering spirit of hard struggles during the new period, 
never break away from the masses, stand in no fear of 
difficulties and problems, guard against the tendency of seeking 
ease and comfort, oppose extravagance and waste, be industrious 
and frugal, make unceasing efforts to improve ourselves, and 
score new results in our cause on a constant basis. 
  Fellow Deputies, 
  Reform, development, and stability are the call of our 
times, 
and also the aspiration of the people. We should further 
enhance our senses of mission and urgency, rally more closely 
around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at 
its core, and under the guidance of the party's basic theories 
and basic line and under the leadership of the provincial party 
committee, closely rely on the people of the entire province, 
work with one heart and one mind, carry out hard struggles, and 
strive for greater victories in Fujian's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive!

  [Text] Fuzhou, May 20 (XINHUA) -- Southeast China's Fujian 
Province plans to employ 3,000 foreign experts to help with its 
economic development, while sending 5,000 of its own people 
abroad to take advanced training courses in the coming two years. 
  These people will be mainly involved in the fields of 
agriculture, industry, science and technology, and education. 
  One of the first provinces in China to carry out the reform 
and open further to the outside world, Fujian has long paid 
attention to inviting talented people, an official of the 
provincial bureau of personnel said. 
  A survey shows that 1,800 technicians, managerial workers 
and 
experts in culture and education from Japan, the United States, 
Germany, Italy, Denmark, and Taiwan and Hong Kong have been 
invited to work in the province since 1984.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 20 (XINHUA) -- The private economy is 
booming in Shanghai, China's largest economic center. 
  According to the latest statistics, the city now has about 
10,000 private enterprises with a registered capital of 2.6 
billion yuan, increases of 14 percent and 50 percent, 
respectively, over 1993. 
  China's private economy disappeared in the 1950's, but 
resumed and burgeoned after 1979, when China began its national 
reform and opening to the outside world. 
  To help the private economy develop healthily, the municipal 
government has worked out a package of policies in favor of 
private businesses. 
  Encouraged by the municipal government, more and more 
scientists have left their research institutions to set up 
non-governmental enterprises specializing in spreading research 
findings, and Chinese scholars studying abroad are retuning to 
Shanghai to set up businesses.

  [Text] Price hikes in the city of Guangzhou are slowing 
down somewhat. According to statistics, in April this year, the 
city's general level of retail prices and general level of 
wholesale prices were 17.5 and 21 percent higher respectively 
than the same period last year. However, compared with March 
this year, the margins of increase were 3.7 and 4.6 percent 
lower respectively. 
  The main reason why price hikes in April slowed somewhat is 
that the government has adopted relevant measures to curb price 
increases.

  [Text] Shenzhen, May 19 (CNS) -- Shenzhen is now gradually 
relaxing restrictions on the issuing of certificates of property 
rights for the real estate business. Many regulations 
considered obstacles to the real estate development in the past 
were recently eliminated in a bid to further invigorate the real 
estate market here. 
  Progress was rather slow in the issuing of the certificates 
since the municipality began such practice in 1989. The number 
of certificates issued each year was some 15,000 on average. As 
conditions set for the certificates were so complicated, a lot 
of estate owners found it difficult to have a certificate in any 
easy way. It turned out that property rights to real estate 
were actually possessed by estate owners but far from being 
recognized because they had no valid certificate issued by the 
authorities. Real estate under such circumstances was not 
allowed for trading nor for mortgage while it was also not 
allowed to be given out as a gift nor to be exchanged. The real 
estate market therefore received ill effects on further 
development. The Shenzhen Bureau of Land made a breakthrough 
recently by working out a number of measures which are in line 
with the actual needs. 
  Regulations issued by the bureau stated that owners of 
estate 
who were not given a real estate certificate mainly because of 
due tax unpaid by a particular real estate agency could be 
issued with such certificates if they had paid the tax. 
Transfer and mortgage are possible for unfinished flat 
providing that the real estate certificate has been sealed with 
a stamp. A substitute certificate is possible for owners of 
estate who are eager to have their estate transferred, mortgaged 
or leased but their estate have not yet been registered with the 
authorities by the real estate agency. Owners of estate are 
qualified for an official real estate certificate if the real 
estate agency completed the initial procedure of registration 
even though charges on added value of land have not yet been 
settled. Owners of estate who lost their documents or relevant 
papers can also be given a real estate certificate if they meet 
requirements and conduct necessary procedures.

  [Text] Zhuhai, May 19 (CNS) -- Zhuhai, the Special 
Economic Zone city in Guangdong Province, which was recently

regulation will go into effect next month. 
  According to Mayor of Zhuhai, Mr. Liang Guangda, the above 
measure is aimed at further opening the city to the outside 
world and vitalizing tourism industry there and is an important 
step for the smooth implementation of exemption of visa for 
overseas visitors.

the number of such tourists last year reached 60,000. With the 
implementation of the above measure, foreign visitors to the

  [Text] Song Ping, former member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of 
the China Family Planning Association, stressed: In carrying 
out family planning work, we should make unreserved efforts to 
improve work style and work methods, step up family planning 
propaganda and education, and provide the broad masses of the 
people with better services relating to production, livelihood, 
and child birth with a view to creating better conditions for 
family planning work. This, Song Ping stressed, is where the 
unifying force of the China Family Planning Association lies. 
  Song Ping made the above remarks at a recently concluded 
family planning forum in Guilin, which was attended by the 
chairmen of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region family 
planning associations. 
  In his speech delivered at the Guilin forum, Song Ping 
stated: At present, there are two prevailing views regarding 
China's family planning work, both of which are at once 
incommensurate with the realities of China and detrimental to 
China's family planning work. The first view is: Once China's 
economy is developed, China's population growth rate will drop 
as a result. Song Ping said: We should firmly bear in mind the 
per capita concept while pushing forward the country's economic 
growth. Should we fail to place population growth under 
control, we will definitely find it impossible to achieve faster 
economic growth. The second view is: Now that China has started 
building a market economy, population growth should also be 
regulated by the market. Song Ping said: China's basic national 
conditions have made family planning an inevitable choice for 
the Chinese people. Thus, governments at all levels across the 
country are duty-bound to regulate and control population 
growth. Any attempt to place population growth under market 
regulation would undoubtedly make it impossible for China to 
fulfill its population control targets. Under no circumstances 
should we slacken family planning efforts. 
  Song Ping stated: As it takes years to transform ordinary 
people's population concepts, it is necessary to carry on family 
planning propaganda and education for years to come. Though 
family planning is considered beneficial to the country and the 
people, some citizens still harbor misconceptions about family 
planning and have yet to recognize the great significance of 
family planning work. In view of this situation, first and 
foremost, we should carry on patient, meticulous, and convincing 
family planning propaganda and education, integrate propaganda 
on the basic national policy of family planning with universal 
education on state laws, and energetically publicize the PRC 
Constitution and the PRC Marriage Law, as well as various 
locally promulgated family planning regulations in order that 
the broad masses of citizens will gradually take family planning 
as their unshirkable duty. Second, we should integrate 
propaganda on family planning with the popularization of 
knowledge of birth control and eugenic techniques with an eye on 
protecting the health of both mothers and infants and further 
improving population quality. Third, we should integrate 
propaganda on family planning with efforts to shake off poverty 
and achieve a comparatively well-off livelihood. At the moment, 
Song Ping noted, what the rural populace is most concerned with 
is finding effective ways and means of eradicating poverty and 
achieving a comparatively well-off livelihood. Family planning 
associations at all levels across China should take full account 
of this situation and actively try to provide the rural populace 
with better family planning services, thereby helping them 
further develop production and achieve prosperity. Family 
planning, Song Ping stressed, is a project about the human brain 
and body and about each and every aspect of a human family. 
This project comprehensively reflects a country's population 
culture. Family planning associations at all levels in China 
should therefore try to provide the broad masses of the people 
with comprehensive and varied services in terms of population 
growth control, population quality improvement, health 
protection for mothers and infants, civilized family building, 
living environment improvement, and so on. 
  Song Ping stated: While family planning is being carried on, 
China will inevitably confront a series of problems caused by an 
increasingly aging population. In view of this situation, 
family planning associations at all levels in China should try 
to show more concern for senior citizens, actively advocate and 
implement an old-age pension system by joining hands with the 
departments concerned, help senior citizens tackle actual 
problems, and provide senior citizens with necessary financial 
assistance. 
  Song Ping called for organically integrating family 
planning management with family planning education among the 
people; conducting down-to-earth family planning work; steadily 
pushing ahead with nationwide propaganda, education, and 
services relating to family planning work; and gradually 
regularizing and systematizing family planning work so that the 
broad masses of the people will more consciously carry out 
family planning in society. 
  The forum was held under the auspices of China Family 
Planning Association and was attended by the chairmen of 11 
provincial, municipal, and autonomous region family planning 
associations. 
  Zhao Fulin, secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region 
CPC Committee, attended and delivered a speech at the forum in 
which he said: The fact that the forum is being held in Guangxi 
has given a powerful impetus to Guangxi's family planning work. 
Comrade Song Ping's speech to the forum has greatly enlightened 
Guangxi's family planning workers. After this forum, we will 
make every possible endeavor to implement and carry out the 
spirit of the forum. 
  Liu Mingzu, deputy secretary of the regional party 
committee, 
chairman of the people's congress standing committee, and 
chairman of the family planning association, also delivered a 
speech at the forum in which he briefed participants on the work 
achievements of the Guangxi Family Planning Association. 
  Participants in the forum also visited Tonghua village, 
Linchun County, Guangxi, a model family planning village 
commended by the Guangxi Family Planning Association.

  [Text] Haikou, May 19 (XINHUA) -- An industrial port and 
refinery project which will refine six million tons of crude oil 
was launched today in south China's Hainan Province. 
  The Jinpai International Industrial Port is a main part of 
Hohbond petrochemical project, top among the 14 ongoing large 
projects in the province. 
  The Hohbond project, located in the northwest part of this 
island-province and wholly foreign-financed, is expected to have 
an output value of 14 billion yuan. 
  It will exert great impact on the province's economy, since 
Hainan has so far grossed 10 billion yuan in annual industrial 
output value. 
  The Hainan Hohbond International Petrochemical Ltd. has a 
registered capital of 210 million U.S. dollars. 
  To cost 900 million yuan, the industrial port will go into 
operation in June, 1996. 
  The port, 70 kilometers west of the Yangpu Development Zone 
and separated from Vietnam and provinces of Guangdong Province 
and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region by sea, has favorable 
natural conditions to be a good harbor. 
  In addition to the Hohbond project, the other important 
items 
in Hainan include a heat and power plant with a generating 
capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, a harbor which can handle 30 
million tons of goods, a storage and transportation base and a 
reservoir. 
  All of them will be under construction this year.

encouraging its enterprises and organizations to set up economic 
entities around the construction site to offer more jobs for 
local people. 
  It also allocated special funds to help Yichang train 
technicians. 
  Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, has completed 60 projects 
with a total investment of 83.47 million yuan in co-operation 
with Yichang city. 
  Located on the upper reaches of the Yangtze, Chongqing city

  Vice-Mayor Meng also said that in order to build Beijing

up a complete port system in the area consisting of airports, 
railway ports, highway ports and coastal ports before early next 
century.

  [Text] Hohhot, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China's longest local 
railway -- from Jining to Tongliao in northern China's Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region -- has been completed after nearly 
four years of construction. 
  The 943-kilometer long railway, which cost 1.8 billion yuan, 
will greatly ease the middle and short-range passenger and 
freight transport pressure in northern China, officials from the 
Ministry of Railways said at a ceremony yesterday. 
  The railway will be an important route for passengers, coal 
and timber from the western part of the region to the eastern 
coast. Rich natural resources will be better utilized and 
development of minority nationalities-inhabited areas will be 
accelerated, officials said. 
  The railway will be a section of the second Eurasia railway, 
to run from Jinzhou city in Liaoning Province to Rotterdam in 
the Netherlands via Erenhot, Ulaanbataar and Moscow. 
  The new local railway is aimed to have an annual handling 
capacity of seven million tons in the near future and 17 million 
tons later. The track crosses four leagues (prefectures) and 13 
counties or banners. 
  The railway will cut 537 km off the route from the four 
leagues to Hohhot, capital of the autonomous region, compared 
with the old route via Hebei Province or Beijing.

  [Text] Taiyuan, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Shanxi Province in north 
China has applied 332 scientific and technological achievements 
in agriculture over the past decade. 
  A local government official said that this scientific 
progress has resulted in increases of 20.29 billion kilograms of 
grain and 27.8 billion yuan in farmers' income over the past ten 
years. 
  The province has used more than 100 fine seeds in 3.2 
million 
hectares, an area which accounts for 80 percent of the total 
arable land in the province. 
  The Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Shanxi 
University of Agriculture and other agricultural research 
institutes have played key roles in the popularization of 
agricultural technology. 
  Of the more than 300 items of scientific research 
achievements completed by the Shanxi Academy of Agricultural 
Sciences, 60 percent have been applied to farm production. For 
instance, research achievements in raising grain yield per 
hectare and enhancing crops' resistance to drought have been 
successfully applied. 
  The official said that to popularize scientific achievements 
in agriculture, the province has mobilized more than 10,000 
technicians to work in rural areas. 
  The province now has 200,000 hectares of high-yield fields 
for the application of new technology.

  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- A group of independence 
activists on Monday [16 May] vowed to push for the drafting of a 
new constitution, defying warnings by government officials and 
the ruling Kuomintang that doing so would add to the tension 
between Taiwan and Mainland China. 
  Legislator Huang Huang-hsiung of the Democratic Progressive 
Party [DPP], Taiwan's largest opposition party, told the press 
that "the committee of the Taiwanese Constitution movement" will 
hold its second meeting on June 24-25 to discuss the matter. 
  The committee, comprising the World United Formosans for 
Independence (WUFI) and some other independence organizations, 
also plans to carry advertisements in Taiwan's five newspapers 
on Tuesday asking for public submissions on a national anthem 
and flag for the "new republic." 
  An interior ministry official said the committee, created 
last year, has not registered with the government and is 
therefore an illegal civilian body. He said any action taken by 
the organization to promote secessionism would be against the 
law, but he did not elaborate. 
  Chien Han-sheng, chairman of the Kuomintang Taipei 
Committee, 
when asked to comment on the committee's efforts, said: "It 
will create confusion and tension across the Taiwan Strait." 
  Li Ying-yuan, WUFI secretary-general, rebuffed the criticism 
and said the committee will go ahead with its plan as scheduled 
regardless of the government's response.

  [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- Secretary-General Hsu 
Shui-teh of the Kuomintang on Thursday [19 May] released an 
article attributing Taiwan's political and economic achievements 
to the able leadership of President Li Teng-hui. 
  Hsu wrote the article, entitled "Opening a New Era With 
Wisdom and Courage," to mark the fourth anniversary of Li's 
inauguration. 
  In the article, Hsu says Li has successfully led Taiwan in 
pushing ahead with political reforms while maintaining high 
economic growth during the past few years. 
  "Taiwan is now using its political success and economic 
strength to make a breakthrough in the diplomatic arena and 
exercise its influence in the mainland with its market-oriented 
reforms," the article says. 
  Hsu said Li's major achievements have been implementing the 
constitutional reforms initiated by the late President Chiang 
Ming-kuo; adopting a flexible policy in order to expand Taiwan's 
diplomatic arena and increase its presence in the international 
community; and reducing cross-strait tension through increased 
exchanges with the mainland.

  [Text] Taipei, May 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan's designation in the 
Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) will be changed to 
"Chinese Taipei Member Committee of the PBEC," sources said 
Friday [20 May]. 
  The sources quoted Robert Lis, director of the PBEC 
International Affairs Division, as saying earlier this week that 
four PBEC member nations -- Taiwan, the United States, South 
Korea and Australia -- will be required to change their 
designation in the private regional economic cooperation 
organization. 
  "We have asked the four to change their names in the PBEC in 
accordance with their designation in the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum," Lis noted. 
  The move is expected to facilitate the PBEC's bid to join 
APEC as an observer to increase its influence in regional 
economic affairs, Lis explained. 
  Taiwan became a full member of the Hawaii-based organization 
under the name of "Chinese Member Committee of PBEC in Taipei" 
in 1983. 
  Lis confirmed that the PBEC has decided to admit Mainland 
China, Russia and Colombia as its new members during its 1994 
annual meeting scheduled to open Saturday in Kuala Lumpur, 
Malaysia. 
  Mainland China will be called "China Member Committee of the 
PBEC," Lis reported. 
  Jeffrey Koo, president of the Taipei PBEC Committee, said 
Taiwan has not opposed Beijing's admission to the PBEC. "We 
only regret that Beijing once tried to force PBEC authorities to 
ask us to change our designation in the organization," Koo noted. 
  After long consultations, the PBEC finally decided to ask 
Taiwan and the above-mentioned three other countries to 
simultaneously change their designation in accordance with their 
names in APEC, a 17-member governmental-level forum founded in 
1989 to promote economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Koo, heading a delegation of business executives and 
economists, left for Kuala Lumpur Friday to attend the May 21-25 
PBEC annual meeting. 
  The PBEC was founded in 1968 by a group of business leaders 
from the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and 
Australia. It provides a forum for bankers and business 
executives in Pacific basin countries to exchange views and 
forge cooperative ties. It had 22 members at the end of 1993.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 13 (CNA) -- The relatives of the 
Taiwan victims killed in the March 31 Qiandao Lake disaster 
Friday [13 May] expressed their dissatisfaction with Mainland 
China's investigation of the incident. 
  The relatives, who on Thursday ended their visit to Qiandao 
Lake with a Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) delegation led by 
deputy secretary-general Hsu Hui-you, said in a joint statement 
that the trip "hasn't increased their understanding of the 
truth" behind the tragedy, in which 24 Taiwan tourists and eight 
mainland crew and guides were burned to death in the lower deck 
cabin of the tour boat they had been cruising on. 
  "On the contrary, it did increase our doubts of the result 
of 
investigation," they said. 
  Four mainlanders were arrested for robbing and murdering the 
tourists. The incident provoked a storm of protest in Taiwan 
and led to a boycott organized by local travel agents of tour 
groups to the mainland. 
  The SEF delegation, which also included criminal 
investigators, visited Qiandao Lake and were able to inspect the 
boat on which the victims perished. In a meeting with mainland 
police Friday morning in Hanzhou, however, the group raised 50 
questions pertaining to the incident, all of which went 
unanswered. 
  Taiwan has accused the mainland of attempting to cover up 
the 
incident, and has demanded that it clear up remaining questions, 
such as the kind and number of weapons used by the killers, the 
time of the killing, and whether mainland police set fire to the 
boat a second time to destroy evidence of the crime. 
  Meanwhile in Taipei, vice chairman Kao Koong-lien of the 
Mainland Affairs Council said that the SEF delegation will 
publish the results of its investigative trip prior to its 
departure for home Saturday. 
  He called on local travel agents to continue the tour group 
boycott until mainland authorities make known all the facts of 
the case.

  [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- Taiwan should consider 
establishing an independent corporate credit consulting 
organization to help mainland Chinese banks serve the needs of 
Taiwan companies with mainland interests, a senior mainland 
banker suggested here Thursday [19 May]. 
  "The establishment of such an organization may make it 
easier 
for Taiwan-owned companies in Mainland China to obtain loans 
from mainland banks," said Qin Chijiang, director of the Banking 
Research Institute under the People's Bank of China. 
  Qin is part of a 12-person mainland delegation here to 
attend 
a seminar on banking systems and capital market developments on 
both sides of the Taiwan strait. The seminar is being put on by 
the Chunghua Institute for Economic Research and the Taipei 
Banking Development Foundation. 
  Qin said it is not difficult for Mainland China-based Taiwan 
firms to obtain loans from mainland banks, pointing out that the 
Taiwan firms can obtain loans by using their foreign exchange 
revenues as collateral. However, he admitted that Taiwan firms 
still cannot get big loans on the mainland. 
  "Further consultations are needed between mainland banks and 
Taiwan-owned firms to expand such financing services," Qin noted. 
  He also said Mainland China cannot yet allow foreign-owned 
banks on the mainland to handle deposits and loans in mainland 
currency because "our banking management, fiscal, and taxation 
systems [word indistinct] still far different from those in 
foreign countries." 
  A colleague of Qin, Yu Tianyi, said Mainland China still 
faces a host of problems in banking reforms. For one thing, he 
said, commercial banks only play a limited role in the banking 
system. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the 
Agricultural Bank of China, the People's Construction Bank of 
China and the Bank of China -- all state-owned banks -- dominate 
banking services on the mainland, he said. "The priority goal of 
the four banks is to support Beijing's official policy, not to 
serve businesses or make profits." He explained. 
  Yu, a professor at the Banking Institute of China, said the 
mainland is scheduled to unveil a comprehensive draft banking 
law and special regulations governing commercial banks late this 
year.

  [Text] Speaking yesterday [7 May] at a seminar on 
mainland-related economic and trade policy and cross-strait 
transportation sponsored by the [words indistinct] Junior 
Chamber in Taichung City, Huang Kun-hui, chairman of the 
Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] under the Executive Yuan, said: 
As part of our plans to build Taiwan into a business center in 
the Asia-Pacific region, we do not exclude the possibility of 
establishing direct transportation links with Mainland China. 
However, we should not end up turning Shanghai into a business 
center following the establishment of such links. Now is not 
the time to foster wide-ranging transportation links. 
  Huang Kun-hui said: Direct cross-strait transportation can 
indeed reduce the cost and time of shipping containers. 
However, since our country and Communist China are in a state 
of hostility, the unconditional establishment of such links will 
amount to an acknowledgement that any direct routes thus 
established are domestic routes in Communist China. This will 
make it difficult to clarify to other nations that our country 
is not a province of China. Also, direct transportation 
services will affect our country's alert status.

  [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Liu Tai-ying, president of 
the Kuomintang [KMT] Business Management Committee, said Friday 
[13 May] that KMT-run enterprises will strengthen cooperation 
with South Korea, Japan, Russia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. 
  Liu, a renowned economist, made the statement upon his 
return 
from a week-long visit to South Korea and Japan. He said 
KMT-owned firms have made plans to work together with South 
Korea's financial sector to open banks and leasing companies in 
Indonesia in line with the government's "southern strategy," 
which encourages Taiwan investors to increase investments in 
Southeast Asia. 
  He said he had visited the Mitsubishi Co. and the Mitsui Co. 
in Japan to seek bilateral cooperation in shipping, energy, 
transportation, tourism, and trade. 
  The ruling party is also considering investing in Russia's 
salmon, cement, and forestry industries, Liu said. Russian made 
goods could be shipped to Hong Kong for resale to Indonesia and 
Vietnam, while Taiwan's electronics products and Indonesia's 
petrochemical goods could be exported to Russia, he elaborated. 
  To help promote the "southern strategy," he said, senior 
executives of KMT-run enterprises will make a trip to Jakarta 
and Surabaya in Indonesia next month to talk with their 
Indonesian counterparts on cooperative ties. 
  Liu said that he will visit Indonesia again in July to make 
a 
final decision on the investment plans. He first visited the 
Southeast Asian country in early April. 
  The KMT-owned companies are also planning to make inspection 
tours of Myanmar [Burma], North Korea, and Palau this year as 
part of their efforts to explore new outlets, he added.

  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- The ruling Kuomintang has 
decided to join hands with South Korean companies in buying 
banks in Indonesia in line with the government's "southern 
strategy," Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the KMT [Kuomintang] 
Business Management Committee, said Saturday [14 May]. 
  "We will seek to buy existing banks run by Chinese in 
Indonesia and establish leasing companies to provide financial 
support for the Taiwan businesses there," Liu said. 
  Taiwan-invested businesses in Indonesia mostly rely on 
foreign banks and the Jakarta office of the China Trust 
Commercial Bank for loans. 
  Liu, during his visit to Jakarta in April, approached 
several 
leading conglomerates with the plan and reached a preliminary 
agreement with a South Korean bank in May. 
  Liu also said that in addition to Indonesia, the KMT is also 
planning to buy a bank in Hong Kong before the colony's transfer 
to Mainland China in 1997. 
  He said that the plan to run banks and other financial 
businesses is only part of the party's "all-out" overseas 
investment policy. Manufacturing and trading industries, he 
added, will follow.

  [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- The Chinese National 
Federation of Industries will send a 60-member delegation to the 
Philippines' Subic Bay May 24-26 to inspect potential investment 
sites, a federation official said Thursday [19 May]. 
  Vice Secretary-General Chen Chin-nan said the group members 
will seek to understand labor problems there and consult with 
Philippine authorities on the business tax they will collect 
from Taiwan investors. 
  Chen said as the Philippines has frequent labor disputes and 
strikes, Taiwan investors are concerned about whether there will 
be similar incidents when they set up business there. 
  Investment in Subic Bay is one part of the government's 
"southern strategy," which encourages Taiwan investment in 
Southeast Asia.

  [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- The development of 
ROCSAT-1, Taiwan's first satellite intended for both 
communications and scientific research, is expected to begin as 
scheduled, an official of the National Science Council (NSC) 
said Thursday [19 May]. 
  The NSC signed a contract with the U.S.-based TRW space and 
electronics group in mid-April to jointly build and launch the 
satellite, said NSC Vice Chairman Hu Ching-piao, who also 
supervises operations of the national space program office 
(NSPO), the executive agency in charge of the satellite project. 
The launch of ROCSAT-1 is scheduled for the end of 1998. 
  The contract, inked by Hu and Bruce Gerding, vice president 
of TRW's civil and international systems division, carries an 
important rider stipulating that the contract will become void 
if TRW fails to acquire an export license from the U.S. 
Government within 60 days. 
  As technology acquisition is a predominant factor in 
international procurements, Hu said, a technology assistance 
agreement is integral to the ROCSAT-1 contract. The rider also 
mandates that TRW must secure such an agreement from the U.S. 
Government to implement the deal. Technology assistance 
agreements are required by U.S. companies before they can export 
high technologies. 
  Gerding informed the space program office Thursday that TRW 
officials, confident in acquiring both the technology assistance 
agreement and an export license in time, will visit Taipei on 
Monday and Tuesday to brief the office on progress regarding the 
contract, NSPO Deputy Director Jung Kai said. 
  Once the technology-assistance agreement is secured, Jung 
said, the NSPO will send 24 engineers to TRW headquarters in 
Redondo Beach, California to participate in the design, 
development, manufacture and testing of the satellite, which 
carries a price tag of NT$ [New Taiwan dollar] 1.6 billion 
(U.S.$59.26 million). 
  The NSC began the ROCSAT-1 procurement project in December 
1993. Four foreign companies, including France's Matra Marconi 
-- a group comprising French and Israeli aircraft industries, 
Germany's Dornier, France's Alcatel, and TRW submitted bids. 
  TRW was awarded the contract in April after the NSC 
evaluated 
the bids, Hu said. 
  Under a NT$13.6 billion (U.S.$509 million) space program, 
Taiwan plans to have three satellites in orbit by 2006. 
  TRW, a leading space/defense contractor to the U.S. 
Government, has developed and launched 175 spacecraft and more 
than 500 scientific payloads in the past 35 years, according to 
TRW officials.

  [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- Taiwan's widening trade 
deficit with Europe has caused grave concern that the economy 
has hit a bottleneck. 
  Statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs show 
that Taiwan posted a US$760 million trade deficit with Europe in 
the first four months of the year. The figure not only 
represented a huge 300-fold increase over the US$2.5 million 
deficit registered in the same period a year ago, it also 
exceeded the US$677 million deficit posted last year as a whole. 
  Together with the US$4.96 billion and US$348.5 million 
deficits contracted with Japan and South Korea, the trade 
imbalance with those three regions amounted to more than US$6 
billion, nearly offsetting Taiwan's surplus with Hong Kong 
during the four-month period. 
  As Europe is Taiwan's third-biggest trade partner after Asia 
and North America, the mounting deficit with the region has 
become a thorny issue for the government, almost on a par with 
the long-standing trade gap with Japan. 
  Bilateral trade between Taiwan and Europe hit a record high 
of US$26.4 billion last year, but that figure represented a 
minimal growth rate over 1992, ministry officials said. They 
said trade with Europe may continue to stagnate as Taiwan 
increases its focus on doing business in the burgeoning mainland 
Chinese and Southeast Asian markets. 
  Taiwan's trade with Europe began to decline in 1992, when 
the 
trade surplus with European countries fell dramatically to 
US$1.48 billion from US$4.03 billion in 1991. European-bound 
exports have continued to decline since. 
  If the downward trend continues, Taiwan's trade deficit with 
Europe may hit a new high of US$2.3 billion for the year. 
  Although officials attributed Taiwan [words indistinct] 
widening gap is also a signal that local industries have not 
made sufficient adjustments in the face of the unification of 
European markets. 
  In order to keep the nation's entire foreign trade surplus 
from being eaten up by the deficit with Europe, ministry 
officials called on the government to examine and adjust its 
current economic policies and export strategies with Europe in 
order to help the nation avoid further foreign trade and 
economic losses.

<F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan's booming export 
years are fading. 
  As exports continue to slide, Taiwan's trade surplus this 
year is expected to drop to a 13-year low of U.S.$2 billion, 
compared to U.S.$18.7 billion in 1987, the Board of Foreign 
Trade (BOFT) reported Friday [13 May]. 
  Taiwan's trade surplus continued to fall in the first four 
months of this year, even after the island recorded its lowest 
trade surplus in nine years in 1993, BOFT Deputy 
Director-General Lin Yi-fu said. 
  If the trend persists, he said, Taiwan is doomed to become 
an 
import-oriented country rather than an export-oriented one. 
  Lin said the development may serve as an important early 
warning signal for Taiwan, an economy heavily dependent on 
manufacturing industries and exports. 
  As exports are becoming less vital, domestic demand will 
become the prime mover behind the country's economic growth in 
the future, Lin maintained. 
  Lin hoped that Taiwan would follow in the footsteps of 
Singapore in keeping a surplus in its international balance of 
payments despite running a deficit in foreign trade. 
  Singapore has witnessed deficits in foreign trade during the 
last five years. It, however, maintained a comfortable 
international balance of payments surplus of U.S.$3 billion in 
1992, with its two-way trade deficit exceeding U.S.$8.7 billion, 
Lin said. 
  Meanwhile, Lin hoped that Taiwan would not turn out to be 
the 
second South Korea, which was ousted from the informal "Asian's 
four little dragons" grouping last year because of its 
relatively poor economic performance. 
  South Korea has suffered a continued decline in exports 
during the last few years due to sluggish industrial 
development. Its economy failed to pick up because other 
domestic industries, including the service industry, didn't rise 
to fill the vacancies left by departing manufacturing 
industries, Lin said. 
  According to customs tallies, Taiwan exported U.S.$27.58 
billion worth of goods and services in the January-April period 
of this year, up 2.3 percent over the similar period last year, 
with metal, electrical machinery, and textile products 
dominating the export list. 
  Imports during the four-month period totaled U.S.$26.98 
billion, up 7.2 percent over a year-earlier, with capital 
equipment, industrial and farm raw materials, metals, and 
chemicals leading the trade. 
  During the four months, exports to the United States, Japan 
and Europe all declined while Taiwan's deficit with Japan 
increased, Lin said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- Acting to respond to the 
government's efforts to correct the nation's chronic towering 
trade deficit with Japan, business figures on Monday [16 May] 
echoed and endorsed a government plan to set up a privately 
owned holding company. 
  At a meeting with Board of Foreign Trade officials and 
private sector representatives Monday, Kao Ching-yuan, chairman 
of the Chinese National Federation of Industries, gave his 
backing to the proposed company, and suggested that the 
government finance the company's research and development 
projects after its establishment. 
  A follow-up meeting scheduled for June 9 by the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs is set to make further plans regarding the 
company's proposed opening date and what products it will make 
in trying to replace Japanese imports, the board said. 
  The board said the holding company would first begin 
producing key parts and components that are imported from Japan 
to the tune of US$50 million each on a yearly basis. 
  Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$4.96 billion in the 
first 
four months of the year, up 4.5 percent from the same period 
last year. But its deficit with Japan was US$14.22 billion last 
year, and the figure is expected to hit US$15.5 billion this 
year.

  [Text] Geneva, May 19 (CNA) -- The fifth meeting of a 
special working party screening Taiwan's application for 
membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
ended here Thursday [19 May] with some results. 
  "We have made progress in negotiations on our terms of entry 
into GATT," said Sheu Ke-sheng, Taiwan's vice economic affairs 
minister and chief negotiator in the three-day meeting. 
  Many GATT contracting parties reaffirmed their support for 
Taiwan's GATT accession during the meeting, Sheu said. 
"Nevertheless, they also want us to make sure that all GATT 
requirements are respected," he admitted. 
  Foreign delegates urged Taiwan to remove restrictions on car 
imports, improve market access for farm products, open up its 
lucrative government procurement contracts to foreign bidders 
and to guarantee protection of patents and copyrights. 
  Sheu explained Taiwan's comprehensive trade liberalization 
plans and its determination to abide by the GATT-initiated 
Uruguay round trade liberalization accords concerning service 
industries and intellectual property rights protection. 
  "We are prepared to deal with services trade issues with the 
intention to become not only a GATT contracting party but also a 
full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO)," Sheu noted. 
The WTO will supersede GATT early next year. 
  The United States, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the 
European Union have expressed the intention to talk with Taiwan 
on the opening of its service markets. 
  Sheu further said Taiwan would try to bring its government 
procurement rules in line with GATT requirements before joining 
the trade regulatory body, but this would require legislative 
and administrative changes. 
  He asked interested GATT members to submit to Taiwan all 
tariff reduction request lists before July 31 so that Taiwan can 
start an overall assessment of offers it would make. 
  The GATT working party will prepare a "checklist" of 
problems 
that need further discussions in future sessions. The working 
party, founded in 1992, has yet to decide when the next meeting 
will be held. Sheu said earlier he hopes the sixth meeting of 
the working party can be held in late July to speed up Taiwan's 
GATT entry. 
  Taiwan has held first rounds of negotiations on tariff and 
non- tariff issues with a dozen nations, including Switzerland, 
Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Hungary, Chile and Turkey. It 
held a second round of such talks with the U.S. in Washington 
earlier this month. 
  The 33-member Taiwan delegation will hold further 
discussions 
with several other countries here before it returns to Taipei 
next week.

  [Text] Taipei, May 19 (CNA) -- The Central Bank of China 
on Thursday [19 May] decided not to adjust the local rediscount 
rate and the New Taiwan [NT] dollar's exchange rate against the 
U.S. currency. 
  The Central Bank reached the decision in a meeting of its 
board of directors and supervisors. 
  The bank said it is unnecessary for Taiwan to follow the 
example of the United States and raise its rediscount rate, or 
the interest rate the central bank charges banks, because 
Taiwan's m2 money supply growth rate was still high at over 15.2 
percent in April, leaving room for commodity prices to move up. 
  Taiwan's current rediscount rate was 5.5 percent. 
  In addition, it said, the new Taiwan dollar's exchange rate 
was at a "reasonable" level against the greenback. The U.S. 
dollar finished Thursday on the Taiwan foreign exchange at 
NT$26.84. 
  Observers said the central bank's decision to maintain a 
loose monetary policy is in line with its policy to revitalize 
the stagnant economy and export growth.

  [Text] Taipei, March 19 [date as received] (CNA) -- The 
Republic of China [ROC] will offer technical and consultative 
assistance to help Nigeria develop export processing zones, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday [19 May]. 
  The Executive Yuan gave the green light Thursday approving 
an 
agreement signed in April by ROC Economics Minister P.K. Chiang 
and his Nigerian counterpart Melford Okilo to cooperate in 
developing export processing zones in the Western African 
country. 
  According to the agreement, Taipei will take the initiative 
in establishing a number of joint-venture industries in Nigeria, 
will encourage Taiwan businesses to invest in the export 
processing zone Taipei is helping develop in Calabar, a port 
city in southeastern Nigeria, and will send technicians and 
management personnel to work at the Calabar Processing Zone. 
  Nigeria is rich in natural resources and has a large 
territory and population, making it an ideal partner for 
business cooperation, ministry officials said. 
  Taiwan and Nigeria maintain no diplomatic relations.

  [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan will work with 
Southeast Asian countries to increase regional intellectual 
property rights (IPR) protection, the Board of Foreign Trade 
(BOFT) said Friday [13 May]. 
  Taiwan is paying equal attention to consultations on both 
IPR 
protection and agricultural imports as part of its effort to 
join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), BOFT 
officials said. 
  The efforts include exchanges of information and personnel 
between Taiwan and members of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN). 
  Besides IPR protection consultations, the officials said, 
BOFT is seeking bilateral recognition of national laboratories 
and cooperation in product verification and quality control 
certification with ASEAN members. 
  Details of the issues will be further discussed in an 
October 
Asia-Pacific meterology conference to be held in Taipei, BOFT 
said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- Taiwan's first civilian 
anti-narcotics group was established in Taipei Saturday [14 May] 
with Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou witnessing the kick-off 
ceremony. 
  At the ceremony inaugurating the Republic of China [ROC] 
Anti-Drug Promotion Group, Ma said that the work against 
narcotics should be deeply rooted in people's minds, and that it 
depends on both government and civilian efforts. 
  He said the anti-drug movement must be jointly pushed by 
both 
government and people, since the moet powerful weapons against 
illegal drugs are in the hands of citizens themselves. 
  Executive director of the newly-established group Liu 
Chang-luen said he and group members will take concrete actions 
over a long period of time in line with Premier Lien Chan's 
policy of combining government and civilian efforts in a war 
against drugs. 
  Those attending the inauguration ceremony at the Taipei 
international convention center included Vice Justice Minister 
Lin Hsi-hu, Legislator Rau Ying-chi, and National Assemblyman 
Tsai Chung-chi.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (AFP) -- China said Thursday it 
supports the proposal put forward by Cambodia's King Norodom 
Sihanouk for roundtable peace talks to end the fighting in his 
country. Foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said "we highly 
appreciate and support King Sihanouk's efforts in realizing 
national reconciliation and maintaining peace and stability in 
Cambodia." 
  King Sihanouk reiterated Wednesday his proposal for the 
different factions in Cambodia to come together for talks in the 
North Korean capital Pyongyang on May 27 to end the fighting 
between the government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas. 
  "We sincerely hope that setting store by their national 
interests, the Cambodian leaders of various parties will, with 
the spirit of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation, 
make joint efforts for national reconciliation," Wu said. 
  Also Thursday, reacting to a U.S. proposal for multinational 
military aid to the Cambodian government, another spokesman said 
China "always hopes that the support and assistance offered by 
the international community to Cambodia should help" maintain 
peace and stability there and foster reconcilliation. 
  Winston Lord, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East 
Asian and Pacific affairs, interviewed from Sydney on Wednesday, 
said that Washington was holding talks with Australia and 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries on providing 
military aid to Phnom Penh to help it fight the Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today that there is 
no such thing as jamming of the Voice of America. 
  At today's press conference, a ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE reporter 
asked: According to a NEW YORK TIMES report, a senior U.S. 
official who accompanied Christopher on his visit to the Middle 
East said that China had agreed with the U.S. side on sending 
technicians to discuss measures to stop the jamming of VOA. The 
report says that this is another major concession made by China 
to win the MFN renewal. Could you please confirm this? 
  Wu Jianmin replied that the Chinese side has agreed with the 
United States to send technicians to China to talk about 
technical matters, such as the question of overlapping 
frequencies. The study of the technical problem of broadcasting 
frequency overlapping by the experts from the two sides has 
nothing to do with the most-favored-nation trading status.

  [Text] Washington, May 19 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said today he has not yet made his decision on the 
renewal of China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status as 
discussions with the Chinese have not been concluded. 
  He told a press conference at the White House this afternoon 
that it is "a decision of great moment for this country." It 
involves not only economic interests and human rights, but 
"enormous national security interests and international security 
considerations for a long time to come," he said. 
  He refused to talk about the on-going discussions with 
China, 
saying that "anything I say about them until we have concluded 
them would be inappropriate." 
  Clinton has until June 3 to decide whether to extend China's 
MFN for another year. 
  In the past few years, opposition to unconditional renewal 
came mainly from the Democrats-dominated U.S. Congress. 
However, the mood has shifted dramatically this year. More and 
more lawmakers have come out in favor of separating trade from 
human rights issues. 
  On Tuesday, 106 members of the House of Representatives, 
Republicans and Democrats, urged Clinton in a letter to renew 
China's MFN without conditions and set up a bilateral commission 
to deal with human rights issues as an alternative to the annual 
confrontation over MFN renewal. 
  And on Wednesday, U.S. House Speaker Thomas Foley declared 
his support for not linking human rights with MFN. He said 
withdrawal of MFN for China would be self-defeating in advancing 
human rights. 
  Senator Bill Bradley (D) told the Senate on Wednesday [18 
May] that the link between human rights and China's trade status 
reflected "Cold War old-thinking" that had no place in a future 
U.S.-Chinese relationship. "A decision to revoke or continue to 
condition China's MFN status would be a blunder of historic 
proportions," he said. 
  Senator Max Baucus (D) reiterated his opposition to MFN 
conditions, which he described as "the economic equivalent of a 
nuclear bomb." "We risk a Cold War with the biggest country in 
the world. It would be folly," he warned. 
  Baucus also dismissed as unworkable the so-called "half 
measures" such as limited sanctions or partial withdrawal of MFN 
on certain categories of products entering the U.S. from China. 
  It was reported that supporters of MFN conditions like 
Senate 
Majority Leader George Mitchell and Representative Nancy Pelosy 
are preparing legislation to place some sanctions on China if 
its MFN is retained.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--A spokesman 
from the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
spoke about the dismissal of Mr. Anthony Cheung Bing-leung from 
the post of Hong Kong affairs adviser. 
  The spokesman said: All of the Hong Kong affairs advisers 
jointly recruited by the State Council Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office and XINHUA Hong Kong Branch are appointed in a 
personal capacity, but party representatives will never be 
invited to take up such posts. This point was repeatedly stated 
when the Hong Kong Affairs advisers were appointed. However, 
after accepting his appointment as a Hong Kong affairs adviser, 
Mr. Cheung claimed that if the "Democratic Party" Central 
Committee decided that there was no need for someone to act as a 
Hong Kong affairs adviser and that person must resign, he would 
follow the decision. This violates our above-mentioned 
principle of recruiting Hong Kong affairs advisers and is thus 
unacceptable. 
  The spokesman also said: In the future, Mr. Cheung is still 
welcome to give us, in a personal capacity, useful and 
constructive advice about Hong Kong's prosperity and stability 
and a smooth transition.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Expulsion Reveals Advisers' True Role"] </F>
  [Text] Any remaining illusions about China's real motives 
for establishing the group of Hong Kong affairs advisers have 
now been swept away with the expulsion of Anthony Cheung, 
dismissed for having the temerity to join the new Democratic 
Party. 
  The initial fear was that the advisers group would become a 
kind of shadow government, undermining the current 
administration of Hong Kong. The initial, most optimistic hope, 
was that the advisers would open up a channel of communication 
between Hong Kong and China so that the incoming sovereign state 
would have its ear closer to the ground in its new territory. 
  Both the fear and hope have failed to materialise. The 
advisers' conclaves have proved to be too incoherent to have 
much impact. They certainly give no credible impression of 
forming any kind of shadow government. 
  On the other hand, it has become clear that China has no 
real 
intention of creating a truly representative group of advisers. 
The membership consists of longstanding supporters of the 
Chinese Government, converts, or potential converts. 
  The exercise of appointing advisers has become an exercise 
in 
giving rewards to the chosen few. Thus, Elsie Tu was rewarded 
for her outspoken criticism of the governor and new converts, 
such as Allen Lee, are being offered an opportunity to move 
closer to the embrace of the new masters. 
  The Chinese Government is employing tactics that are 
familiar 
to those versed in the works of the Soviet Union's first leader 
V I Lenin. His strategy for winning power for the 
revolutionaries was one of the few aspects of revolutionary 
thought absorbed by the infant Chinese Communist Party, under 
the tutelage of the Communist International's agent, Michael 
Borodin. 
  The essence of Leninist strategy was to widen the net of 
those who could be called upon to support the revolution, using 
the outer periphery of supporters to attract mass support, while 
ensuring that real power resided with a highly-disciplined 
revolutionary clique. 
  Beyond the inner circle, a broader band of revolutionaries, 
committed to the cause but not trusted with full knowledge of 
the strategy, were to be brought together. 
  In essence, these tactics have been dusted down and employed 
again in China's battle for control of Hong Kong. The Chinese 
Government has grouped its allies in three categories. First, 
the long-term hard-core supporters, second are those showing a 
willingness to be fully committed (but not yet fully trusted) 
supporters, and third are those with whom it is thought 
desirable to form a tactical alliance. 
  In many ways, the third group is the most important because 
they give China access to a much larger section of the 
population than the other two groups. In addition, the 
recruitment of allies, as opposed to fully committed supporters, 
provides an opportunity to isolate those considered hostile to 
the Chinese Government. 
  Thus, China has created a complex web of advisory bodies and 
appointed a number of people to important-sounding posts within 
the Chinese parliamentary system. The strategy is to reward 
friends, make new friends, and mobilise the widest possible 
alliance against the enemy, who in current circumstances, are 
the pro-democracy groups. 
  Those who remain within the third group of the Chinese 
alliance will have to think long and hard about whether they 
intend to be used in this way. It seems most likely that they 
will stick with their new friends, although some might emit a 
few whimpers of regret over Cheung's dismissal. 
  As many members of the third group used to be counted among 
the colonial government's chosen few, they should be fully aware 
of what to expect. For years, the British administration, in a 
more selective and elitist way, played the game that China is 
now playing with equal skill. 
  The colonial rulers would pluck a number of "suitable" 
people 
from the ranks of the Chinese community and shower them with 
honours, positions of alleged responsibility, and fancy titles. 
  They were then expected to go out and extol the virtues of 
benevolent British rule. They would also be paraded on 
occasions that demanded a token display of confirmation that the 
colonial administration had the support of the local population. 
  The Hong Kong Government still makes desultory attempts to 
mobilise its supporting forces in this manner but the imminence 
of Chinese rule has made the exercise rather problematic. 
  History, as Karl Marx, the founder of communist thought, 
said, is repeating itself; first as tragedy, then as farce. It 
is in this light that we view the purging of Anthony Cheung from 
China's advisory group.

  [Text] Singapore, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China can offer "the 
greatest business opportunity" to the world, Chinese Vice 
Premier Li Lanqing said here today, reassuring foreign 
businessmen that investment in China will "definitely produce 
good returns". 
  "The progress of the world is providing enormous 
opportunities for China's development. And China's development, 
in turn, provides many opportunities for the world's 
prosperity," Li said while addressing the international 
conference of "Waves of the Future - ASEAN, Vietnam, and China: 
Opportunities for World Business". 
  More than 800 delegates, mostly high ranking government 
leaders and officials, successful businessmen, and policy 
researchers, from 21 countries and regions throughout the world 
are attending the three-day meeting, which began on Tuesday. 
  "I can tell our friends with assurance that investment in 
China will definitely produce good returns and opportunities for 
your business development," the vice premier promised in his 
keynote speech. 
  He said that from 1979 to 1993, the total foreign capital 
that China utilized in various forms reached 137.8 billion U.S. 
dollars, of which, direct foreign investment was 61.8 billion 
dollars. 
  The number of foreign invested enterprises already in 
operation in China reached 83,000 by the end of 1993. Most of 
them have had very good business performance and satisfactory 
economic returns, he said. 
  Last year, the total output of those enterprises exceeded 
33.3 billion dollars and their imports and exports reached 67 
billion dollars, accounting for one third of the country's total 
trade volume, Li added.

  [Text] Chengdu, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Qian Qichen 
has called on various places to make big efforts to develop 
tourism by taking advantage of the favorable situation at home 
and abroad. 
  Qian, who also serves as foreign minister, made the call 
during an inspection tour of Sichuan, where he attended a 
national tourism conference, toured noted scenic spots and 
attended the opening ceremony of the Leshan international 
gigantic stone Mitreya Buddha festival. 
  Qian said that some Western countries are in economic 
recession and some countries are in great turmoil and only China 
has been in steady development and are attracting foreign 
investors. After the return of Hong Kong in another three 
years, it would be even more favorable for China to develop 
tourism. 
  According to statistics, China's tourism income from 1978 to 
1993 amounted to 32.1 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The vice-premier urged various places to concentrate efforts 
on improving services, safety and management system. 
  The vice-premier also called for efforts to develop tourism 
souvenir products to make China a "shopping paradise". 
  Qian will continue his inspection of Sichuan today and 
tomorrow.

<F P=106> [By Leng Mou (0397 4188): "Jiang Zemin Performs an </F>
Operation on the Armed Forces in Order To Provide a Guarantee 
for National Security"] 
  [Text] According to the instruction of Jiang Zemin, 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, the Central 
Military Commission and the General Political Department of the 
People's Liberation Army [PLA] made arrangements for all 
military units to train officers in rotation by running courses 
to study the third volume of "The Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" during this year. Reportedly, the CPC top leadership 
holds that it is necessary to improve the style of the armed 
forces through such study activities. Jiang Zemin stressed the 
need to link the theoretical study with reality and to send the 
officers to grass-roots units for investigations and studies so 
that they can work out solutions for existing problems. 
  General Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, recently pointed out when inspecting the troops from 
the three services in Shandong, that the primary tasks for the 
armed forces at present are to defend the party's basic line, to 
defend the socialist system, and to "obey the orders of the 
party central leading body, with Jiang Zemin at the core, at all 
times." Zhang Zhen's remarks showed that a major aim of the 
current efforts to improve the style of the troops was to guide 
them in consciously following and serving the party's "overall 
work arrangements" [gong zuo da ju 1562 0155 1129 1444] and 
prompt them into faithfully defending the central leadership 
with Jiang Zemin at the core. This year is crucial for the 
mainland's reform and opening and because many major reform 
measures will be adopted, the country's socioeconomic and 
political stability will face tests in many aspects. This year, 
reform will enter the stage of dealing with some of the most 
difficult issues and will thus be rather risky. In such 
circumstances, the armed forces will have to provide effective 
security guarantees for the advances of reform. 
  Zhang Zhen said that in order to follow and serve the 
party's 
overall work arrangements, the armed forces should act according 
to the general requirements put forward by Jiang Zemin, that is, 
"measuring up to standard politically, perfectly mastering 
military skills, keeping the fine style of work, being 
well-disciplined, and ensuring effective logistics support." 
Zhang Zhen told the troops of the three services in Shandong to 
put all of the five requirements set by Jiang Zemin into 
practice in a down-to-earth manner, with political integrity 
being of primary importance. 
  In the third volume of Deng Xiaoping's works, one can find 
that Deng mentioned "Jiang Zemin as the core" of the central 
leadership on many occasions. This is of special importance for 
the authority of the third-generation leading body headed by 
Jiang Zemin. 
  Jiang Zemin required that leading cadres at all levels 
reduce 
dining and other social activities to a minimum so that they 
will have more time to study the third volume of Deng's works. 
Jiang also required that while they themselves study in 
earnest, they should also organize their immediate subordinates 
to study properly; and that party cadres and officers at and 
above the county and regimental level should all attend the 
study classes in rotation within two to three years. He said 
that the means of propaganda, such as newspapers, radio and 
television broadcasts, and publications, should be used fully; 
experience should be summed up in good time and spread widely; 
and teaching materials about the theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics should be compiled for political 
education. 
  Jiang Zemin said that the theoretical study in the armed 
forces should also be closely linked with the reality of the 
troops and should serve the purpose of promoting the enhancement 
of the overall quality of leading bodies and the comprehensive 
development of the troops. 
  On 26 April, Liu Huaqing held a discussion meeting with the 
commanders and political commissars of six military regions, who 
were attending the Third Theoretical Study Class for Principal 
Provincial and Ministry Leaders in the Central Party School, on 
the issue of studying the third volume of Deng's works and using 
Deng's theory to guide the work of the armed forces in all 
aspects. Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou, members of 
the Central Military Commission, attended the meeting. Liu 
Huaqing told the six military region leaders Li Xinliang, Liu 
Jingsong, Song Qingwei, Gu Hui, Li Xilin, and Li Jiulong that 
the troops should be commanded rigorously and officers at all 
levels should go deep into the realities of life and effectively 
enhance the military training for the troops. At present, it is 
particularly necessary to intensify the routine management of 
the troops and senior officers should set a good example for the 
troops they command. 
  The establishment and development of the market economy will 
inevitably cause a range of new conditions and new problems for 
the management of the troops in China. The work of troop 
management and education will face a new challenge. In order to 
solve such issues, it is not enough to merely rely on 
ideological education and administrative and economic means. 
Only by relying on the legal system and intensifying troop 
management through enforcing the military rules and regulations 
can we effectively maintain good order inside the military units. 
  In the last few years, Jiang Zemin has repeatedly stressed 
that leaders at all levels must attach importance to employing 
the rules and regulations for improving troop management. He 
instructed the PLA to "give priority to troop management" this 
year by rigorously commanding the troops according to the 
established military rules and regulations and rigorously 
enforcing military discipline in practice. 
  Since the beginning of this year, the Central Military 
Commission has taken the work of strengthening and improving 
troop management as an important point in its work plan. Pilot 
schemes for improving troop management in various aspects and at 
various levels in the new period have been carried out. The 
primary aim is to enhance the quality of officers who are in 
charge of the troops and emphasis was laid on rectifying the 
style and enforcing discipline. Not long ago, the directors of 
the troop affairs and equipment departments of all military 
regions were summoned to Beijing. They analyzed the situation 
regarding the implementation of the instructions on "giving 
priority to troop management" and found that the key to 
improving troop management in the next stage lay in the rigorous 
enforcement of the rules and regulations. 
  Zhang Zhen recently said that in the course of improving 
troop management, it was necessary to implement the Program for 
Consolidating Grass-Roots Military Units effectively. He said: 
This is not only a task for the combat companies, the roles of 
grass-roots officers, backbone soldiers, and military personnel 
committees should all be brought into play. Zhang Zhen said: 
"In a combat company, people are squad, platoon, or company 
leaders, or Communist Party members, or Communist Youth League 
members, or at least revolutionary soldiers. So, everyone 
should play a role in troop management and should be subject to 
management. Thus, troop management as a whole can be ensured." 
  In the study classes for military officers on Deng's works, 
people summed up five major demonstrations of unhealthy 
"formalism" conduct among the troops at present: 
  First, meetings were taken as a criterion for measuring the 
degree of importance being attached by leaders and for assessing 
work performances. Meetings were even taken as concrete action 
in implementing the instructions from the upper leading organs. 
As a result, innumerable meetings were held and leaders had to 
attend many meetings and deal with immense amounts of paperwork. 
  Second, the speeches by leaders of the Central Military 
Commission, the military regions, the army corps, the armies, 
the divisions, and the brigades were relayed from top to bottom 
to the letter without regard to the contents of the instructions 
and the specific conditions of those listening to the 
instructions. Professional systems also had to relay 
instructions to the corresponding organs at the lower level. 
Sometimes, the spirit of one meeting or one document was 
relayed repeatedly on different occasions. 
  Third, there were excessive comparisons and examinations 
adding burdens to the grass-roots units and adding too much 
pressure on the rank and file. 
  Fourth, a number of officers and leaders at various levels 
were sent to grass-roots units as a measure to carry forward the 
style of going deep into the realities of life and they 
intervened excessively in the work at grass-roots level and set 
back the initiative of the grass-roots units. 
  Fifth, some leaders liked to take expedient measures which 
might achieve quick and superficial results so that they would 
win a good name and would also save effort. 
  Lieutenant General Li Xinliang, political commissar of the 
Shenyang Military Region, recently called for rectifying the 
work style among the troops and creating a new situation in the 
work of the military units. He said that "a major breakthrough 
can be made in the aspect of improving the work style of the 
troops." 
  Recently, the Shenyang Military Region took the lead in the 
whole Army to improve the style of troops. The concrete 
requirements were laid down in the form of an official document. 
The specific rules include: Meetings and activities to be held 
by the military region and attended by army-level leaders and 
department heads should first be approved by the commander or 
the political commissar; and meetings to be held in subordinate 
military units should be approved by the party committee of the 
military region or by the military region leader's conference. 
When leaders of the military region inspect subordinate units, 
the unit leaders should not leave the barracks to meet the 
military region leaders or see them off. No security vehicles 
should be used if there are no major activities and no 
videotapes or photos should be taken. No welcoming ceremonies 
and welcoming banners or streamers should be arranged to 
greeting military leaders. 
  Li Xinliang also set three requirements for more than 100 
senior officers at and above the division level who attended the 
Deng's works study class: Make more visits to those units which 
have a weak foundation and cannot acquire advanced experience 
easily; do more things which may not bring fame but can bring 
solid benefits to the troops; and do more things that may not 
bring fame and benefit to the leaders but will enhance the 
combat effectiveness of the troops.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, a top Chinese 
leader, this week suggested that surplus rural labor should be 
organized to build roads and water conservancy facilities. 
  He made the suggestion while on tour of the north China port 
city of Tianjin from May 15-18. Qiao, chairman of the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress, visited a number of 
factories, a duck farm and a TV transmission tower in Tianjin. 
  During his tour he said that the expansion of township-run 
enterprises and the construction of small cities will change the 
face of China's countryside and absorb surplus labor effectively 
as well. 
  He told local officials that as long as Tianjin tries to 
deepen reforms and open wider to the rest of the world, it will 
certainly achieve greater development and promote opening up and 
economic growth in the whole of north China. 
  Qiao, who is also a standing committee member of the 
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee, praised the Tianjin municipal leaders for paying 
close attention to intensifying enterprise restructuring. 
  The invigoration of major state-owned enterprise makes it 
imperative to guide them in orienting themselves with the market 
and improve their economic returns, he noted. 
  These enterprises should be encouraged to import 
sophisticated technology and managerial expertise so as to 
improve their production processes, the quality of their 
products and their management, he said. 
  Moreover, it is necessary to promote vocational training in 
various forms among workers, and relieve enterprises' financial 
burdens by introducing a social security system in order to 
create a good environment for these enterprises to develop, he 
added.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam and Zhang Yuan] </F>
  [Text] Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has agreed to temporarily 
relax credit to bail out state enterprises and solve the problem 
of "triangular debts". 
  Sources close to the State Council said the decision was 
partly motivated by the political consideration of maintaining 
social stability and preventing unemployment. They said Mr Zhu 
was also anxious to improve his image with state entrepreneurs 
and regional cadres, two power blocs that would have a say in 
the post-Deng Xiaoping succession struggle. 
  The sources quoted the vice premier as indicating that 
credit 
policy for the "circulation funds" of industrial enterprises 
could be relaxed in spite of the ongoing fight against 
inflation. Mr Zhu said even enterprises losing money should be 
extended credit "if the funds are being used for the production 
of goods that can be sold" and if the firms can guarantee loan 
repayment. "Banks should dispense loans to help maintain the 
basic living expenses of employees in money-losing enterprises," 
Mr Zhu said. 
  However, he called upon local governments to cover some of 
the expenses for paying the under-employed, saying the centre 
and localities "must join hands in maintaining social stability". 
  Mr Zhu was adamant that funds would not be given to 
enterprises that had no hope of being turned around and that 
such units should be declared bankrupt. But he said bankruptcy 
should only be tried on an experimental basis to avoid social 
disruption. 
  He has also given instructions that credit be provided for 
solving the problem of "triangular debts" or money enterprises 
owe each other. 
  XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) reported last night 
various ministries and banks would join hands to clear up debts 
in sectors including coal, metallurgy, electricity, 
petrochemicals, and lumber. Funds would also be made available 
for the two hardest hit provinces of Heilongjiang and Liaoning. 
  Economic analysts said the relaxation of credit could fuel 
inflation, which the semi-official China News Service described 
as "still high." The agency said fixed assets investment by 
state firms in April was 44.2 percent over the same month last 
year, which was eight percent more than the comparable figure 
for the first three months of the year. 
  Moreover, from January to April, losses incurred by 
state-owned enterprises increased by 62.6 per cent over the same 
period in 1993. The analysts said while pumping money into such 
enterprises could solve the temporary problem of decreasing 
unemployment, the measure might exacerbate the budget deficit 
and fuel inflation without achieving the long-term goal of 
improving efficiency. 
  Chinese sources said various local governments had resisted 
Beijing's call that they dig into local budgets to relieve the 
plight of the unemployed.

Fu Gang (0265 0474)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 May (XINHUA) -- A ceremonial meeting to 
commend advanced young self-employed workers nationwide was held 
at the Great Hall of the People today. Li Lanqing, CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau member and State Council vice 
premier; Wang Bingquan, National People's Congress Standing 
Committee vice chairman; and Wan Guoquan, Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference National Committee vice 
chairman; met with 207 representatives and had a picture taken 
with them. 
  While meeting with the representatives, Li Lanqing said: It 
is my great pleasure to meet you, representatives of advanced 
self-employed workers, and to congratulate you on the honor you 
have received. As is known, a socialist market economy consists 
of various economic sectors, with public ownership as the 
mainstay. It is a long-term national policy to encourage them 
to compete on equal terms, promote each other, and develop 
simultaneously. In recent years, individually owned and 
privately owned economic sectors have developed vigorously 
mainly because of, first, the party's opening up policy and, 
second, the hardworking pioneering spirit and diligent labor of 
individual workers. They have played an important role in 
promoting economic development, which is obvious to all. 
Individual workers should run their businesses according to the 
law, develop their undertakings through honest labor and 
managerial expertise, and contribute to China's economic 
development. It is hoped that they will always remember the 
Chinese virtue of using one's fortune to help others, and will 
lead local people to achieve common prosperity. Meanwhile, we 
should advocate the spirit of readily helping others and donate 
funds to promote educational undertakings. 
  Li Lanqing said: Among self-employed workers, there are 
heroes and models, in addition to outstanding entrepreneurs. 
One of the representatives commended at the current meeting is 
an individual worker from Zhejiang who was burned and injured 
while trying to put out a fire. People are touched by his 
heroic deeds. We hope that other workers will bring into play 
his self-sacrificing spirit and make joint efforts to further 
develop economic and achieve fruitful results in building 
spiritual civilization. 
  In his speech, Wang Bingqian said: Individually run and 
privately run economic sectors are placing an increasingly 
conspicuous role in promoting production, bringing about social 
prosperity, enlivening circulation, making things more 
convenient for everyday life, providing employment, and 
safeguarding social stability. At present, there are some 17.6 
million individually run industrial and commercial units 
employing a total of over 29 million people. They have formed 
an important and indispensable force in China's socialist 
construction. Engaged in honorable undertakings, individual 
workers should be protected by the state laws, recognized by 
society, and respected by the people. 
  The meeting was sponsored by the Communist Youth League 
Central Committee, the State Industry and Commerce 
Administration, and the China Association of Self-Employed 
Workers.

"`Fluctuations' in Commodity Prices"--first four paragraphs are 
RENMIN RIBAO editor's note] 
  [Text] [Begin editor's note] An economist once 
compared prices to the "first button" of clothing. He meant 
that only by fixing its position can all the other buttons be 
positioned in the right place and can all the clothes be neat 
and tidy. His comparison makes some sense. 
  Of all the continuously deepening reforms, price reform has 
the same importance as foreign exchange and tax reforms. In a 
certain sense, price reform has a more extensive meaning because 
prices run through all links of the economy and prices are the 
soul of market growth. 
  Price reform involves tens of thousands of households and 
its 
success firstly depends on the state's macroeconomic policy and 
control and on the behavior of managers. It is also closely 
bound up with the correct concept of prices fostered by the 
masses under the conditions of market economy. 
  Prices are a hot subject of research among economists and 
management departments. There are two issues which are 
discussed or encountered most often in the daily lives of the 
general public, namely the question of price fluctuations and 
the question of price stability. Why do prices fluctuate? Why 
must prices remain stable? Our topic begins here. [end editor's 
note] 
<H5>  Kaleidoscopic Fluctuation </H5>
  Today, prices are changing as often as a kaleidoscope. 
  Examples are easy to find. In the case of cucumber, between 
February and March, the market price for one kilo was four yuan 
or more while one kilo cost six yuan or more in the same period 
last year. Each kilo of rape or celery costs two yuan or so 
this year, but it cost only one yuan or more last year. 
  Seasonal changes are also very obvious. The retail price for 
each kilo of eggs in season is 5.4 yuan but falls to 
approximately four yuan out of season. In winter, meat 
consumption is higher, so meat prices are higher than in summer. 
  Prices during festivals and holidays also change. During 
major traditional festivals each year, television sets and 
refrigerators sell better and at higher prices than in ordinary 
times. Products like freshwater fish are often cheaper on 
Mondays than on Sundays. 
  In the past, a commodity did not have much difference in 
price in all parts of the country except for minimal regional 
price differences. Today, several prices exist for the same 
commodity in the same street. The same commodity will have 
different prices in big and small shops or in collectively run 
or privately run shops. Prices are even different in different 
state-owned shops. The price difference ranges from several 
yuan to dozens of yuan to hundreds of yuan and makes customers 
unable to make a decision. 
  Before reform, prices remained constant for several decades. 
Now they change every year, every month, and even every day. 
The prices of the means of production also fluctuate greatly. 
  Examples are too numerous to quote. 
  Among greatly differing individual phenomena there is a 
"general" fluctuation. We must admit that fluctuation is a 
basic characteristic of prices. Reform is first meant to bring 
back this "nature" to prices so that they change quickly 
according to their value and fluctuate according to market laws. 
  Fluctuation originates with "relaxation." This relaxation 
means that the state no longer directly fixes the prices of most 
commodities but gives enterprises the right to fix prices and 
gives this right back to the market. Therefore, the old price 
system under which "there was only one permanent price for one 
commodity across the country" has come to and end. 
<H5>  Price Increase Is an Associate </H5>
  Fluctuations should be rises and falls, ups and downs. 
However, looking back at the course of price reform over the 
past 15 years, we discover that there have in fact been rises 
and falls. But we cannot deny that there have been more rises 
than falls and that the extent of the rises has been larger than 
the falls. 
  What are the reasons? 
  First, the original price level was fixed in keeping with 
the 
level of economic development and the economic management system 
of the 1950's, which was far from high. Artificially fixed 
product prices were irrational right from the beginning. The 
very rigid system in turn made it impossible for prices to be 
readjusted in keeping with market changes, so it was inevitable 
that the price structure was distorted. Therefore, the "price 
scissors" not only appeared in industrial and agricultural 
products but also between different products in the same 
industry, causing an unfair distribution of interests. A 
distorted price system inevitably suppressed the incentive for 
production. Once price limitations were removed, hidden 
inflation was exposed, thus leading to price increases in the 
course of structural readjustment. 
  As the economy develops, the cost of many products are also 
being raised. This is not only because they are restricted by 
resources which require an increasingly large investment, but 
also because the wages of staff and workers, namely labor costs, 
are increasing. 
  All of these are the driving forces behind price 
increases. Therefore, at the present stage of economic 
development, to some extent it is a necessity for the general 
price level to keep rising. 
  How much pressure has price fluctuation brought to us? Over 
the past 15 years of reform and opening up, there have been 
small fluctuations every year and great fluctuations on three 
occasions. 
  The first occasion was in 1979 when the state considerably 
raised purchasing prices of agricultural and sideline products 
through planned price regulation and raised prices of surplus 
purchases of grain and cotton. In that year, the purchasing 
prices of six grain crops were raised by 21.6 percent. In 1980, 
retail prices of eight nonstaple foodstuffs, including meat and 
eggs, were raised accordingly, and retail prices of commodities 
in society rose by 36 percent. 
  On the second occasion, prices increased considerably and 
the 
increase lasted for a fairly long time. Prices rose by 8.8 
percent in 1985 and by 18.5 percent, which was the highest, in 
1988. In 1989, they rose continuously by 17.8 percent. This 
stage was both a period of speedy growth in the national economy 
and a stage during which important progress was made in price 
reform. 
  The third occasion was that in the wake of the economic 
rectification from 1988 and 1991, the state, taking the 
establishment of a socialist market economy as the goal, 
quickened the progress of price reform in 1992. However, 
regrettably, in 1993 prices increased considerably again. In 
that year, retail prices rose by 13 percent. 
  If we illustrate the extent of price increases over the past 
15 years in comprehensible figures, the general level of retail 
prices in 1993 rose by 2.54 times. Calculated by the quantity 
of final production in 1993, it rose by at least one trillion 
yuan. 
  Faced with the state's financial difficulties and given the 
fact that enterprises have not been invigorated and the 
multi-strata and unfair distribution of income in society, huge 
amounts have been shouldered by the state, enterprises, and 
consumers. This is undoubtedly a remarkable achievement in 
reform. Today, as we look back at this historical episode, it 
shows that we are not unfamiliar with price fluctuations. We 
should not fear them because we are able to keep fluctuations 
under control. 
<H5>  Attitudes Are Changing </H5>
  Price is a very profound economic question as well as a very 
popular topic. Today, people have all kinds of misgivings about 
price fluctuation: To what extent will prices rise? Can we 
endure it? 
  Nevertheless, we cannot but admit that behind these worries, 
people's attitudes are slowly changing. The good wish that 
prices will only go lower and will not rise or remain unchanged 
forever is no longer an ideal people pursue. 
  A survey of 100 households was carried out. "Which of the 
following two situations are you in favor of?" 
  In economic development, 1) prices remain unchanged and 
standards of living remain low; 2) prices increase and standards 
of living improve. [as published] 
  The result was that over 50 percent were in favor of the 
second choice. This was a public opinion poll done by the 
Beijing Municipality's Chaoyang District Price Administration in 
towns of the district at the end of 1993. 
  Coincidentally, subsequent to the Spring Festival of 1994, 
this reporter invited five ordinary factory and hospital staff 
and workers to an informal discussion. They were the district's 
National People's Congress deputies and Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference delegates and their minds 
carried many of the real views of many ordinary people. When 
asked to express their views on the relationship between 
commodity prices and living standards, they chose the second 
choice as well. 
  The two surveys show the same attitude. With practice for 
the past 15 years, people are making new judgments about the 
relationship between commodity prices and economic development 
and between commodity prices and living standards. More people 
do not want price stability with a backward economy and are 
beginning to acknowledge and accept price fluctuations in the 
course of development. Obviously, their outlook is changing. 
  Price fluctuations are no longer regarded as vile. "How good 
it would be if speedy economic development was not accompanied 
by price rises!" "How good it would be if wages would increase 
and commodity prices did not increase!" Many people now say 
that this is only wishful thinking. 
<H5>  Tolerance is Enhanced </H5>
  The change in attitude is not merely a change in outlook, 
its 
foundation is the enhancement of economic tolerance. 
  If what price changes in the early period brought to city 
dwellers was merely that they could buy peanut kernels 
everywhere and daily increasing quantities of meat and edible 
oils, then the several price readjustments that followed until 
1991 resulted in increases in the prices of agricultural and 
sideline products by 168 percent, a rise in the costs of 
extractive industries by 163 percent, and a rise in the prices 
of raw and semifinished materials and manufactured industrial 
goods of 127 percent, and so forth. Amidst price fluctuations, 
we said goodbye to a society where there was a shortage of 
commodities and faced a world with a great variety of 
commodities. 
  Fluctuations have also readjusted a distorted and twisted 
price structure. The previous irrational price parity between 
industrial and agricultural products and the uncoordinated price 
parity between extractive industry and processing industry have 
been changed radically. The function of price as a "barometer" 
is continuously stimulating incentives for production and 
potential and has become a lubricant fostering the market. All 
of this is like lengthening the shortest piece of wood in a 
wooden pail and deepening the wooden pail, as in the "wooden 
pale theory" of economics, so it can hold more water. This 
water is the development of the economy. 
  Not long ago, the Beijing Municipal Price Administration 
made 
a detailed examination and review of the relationship between 
economic development and commodity prices. Based on the actual 
data of each year, they plotted graphs for GDP and commodity 
prices for the years between 1979 and 1992. The results showed 
that this period was a period of speedy economic growth in 
Beijing. Compared with 1978, GDP in 1992 had risen by 550 
percent, showing an average annual growth of 14.3 percent in 14 
years, while commodity prices during the same period rose by an 
average of 7.46 percent. 
  If we fix the growth rate of the per capita living 
expenditure income of Beijing residents in the previous 14 years 
at 1, then the incremental ratio of price increases is 0.33, and 
thus the growth ratio between income and commodity prices is 
1:0.33. Excluding the price factor, the per-capita living 
expenditure income of urban residents has had an actual increase 
of 130 percent, representing an average annual growth of 6.1 
percent. [all figures as published] 
  In other words, although commodity prices have risen, income 
has also increased and actual living standards have improved. 
<H5>  Fluctuation Is An Inevitable Phenomenon </H5>
  Acknowledging the inevitability and positive significance of 
price fluctuations is not the same as acknowledging that prices 
can rise wantonly. Although the rate of economic growth is in 
proportion to the degree of price increases, in practice the two 
lines are not always parallel. 
  After examining the relationship between the two, the 
Beijing 
Municipal Price Administration discovered that in the wake of 
the beginning of every growth cycle, as economic growth 
quickens, prices rise continuously; after the rate of economic 
growth reaches its zenith, prices continue to rise; and as the 
rate of economic growth begins to fall to its lowest point, 
prices rise to their highest point. 
  This is to say price increases sometimes go in a different 
direction from the rate of economic growth. But under what 
circumstances? In the wake of excessively speedy economic 
development, when the growth rate must slow down while price 
increases do not fall, inflation occurs. This is obviously not 
a good thing. 
  To explain the situation, they used several ratios. 
Beijing's rate of economic growth in 1985 was 8.6 percent, a 
decrease of nine percentage points from the 17.6 percent in the 
previous year, and the price index in the same year rose by 18.6 
percent, and the ratio between them was 1:2.05. In 1989, its 
economic growth rate was 4.4 percent, a decrease of 8.4 
percentage points from the previous year, while the price index 
rose sharply to 18.5 percent, and the ratio between them was 
1:3.9. 
  A question is thus raised: When economic growth is in 
proportion to price increase, we need to pay attention to 
another relationship, namely, in what ratio should the two be 
controlled so nothing serious occurs? 
  There are three ways to analyze this. 
  First, if we fix the rates of GDP growth in the previous 14 
years at 1, then the ratio between economic growth and price 
increases between 1979 and 1992 was 1:0.95. 
  Second, if we compare annual average growth rates of the two 
in the previous 14 years, namely, if we take the annual average 
GDP growth rate of the previous 14 years as 9.1 percent and 
compare it with the 7.7 percent annual average rate of price 
increases, we have a ratio of 1:0.85. 
  Economist Zhang Zhuoyuan maintains that it is comparatively 
rational if the ratio between the national economic growth rate 
and the rate of price increases is 1:0.6. 
  Although the above three methods of calculation choose 
different figures, they reflect a law, namely that the disparity 
between economic growth and price increases should not be so 
great. By synthesizing several analyzes and viewing Beijing's 
reality in the previous 14 years, the Beijing Municipal Price 
Administration maintained that the growth ratio between the two 
should be ideally controlled at 1:0.9 and not more than 1:1.5. 
Otherwise, if price increases are too great, it will be 
difficult to coordinate all relationships among all sections in 
economic operations. 
  These circumstances tell us that there is a limit to even 
good things. On this, Chen Dezun, vice president of the Market 
and Price Research Institute, maintains that it is obviously 
impossible to keep prices from rising in the developing economy 
of today; if we keep prices from rising, economic growth will 
slow down; and it is possible for prices to keep rising given 
slowed economic growth. He holds that maintaining a 
comparatively high rate of economic growth without the 
occurrence of serious inflation is a practical choice, and the 
fact that the rate of economic growth is appropriately higher 
than the level of price increases guarantees that most people 
can endure such fluctuations. 
  For prices, we need moderate fluctuations rather than 
shocks.

  [Text] On 10 May, the Hefei City Intermediate People's 
Court held a public meeting to pronounce judgment on six major 
criminals, including Yu Yongsheng. After the meeting, the six 
criminals were sent under escort to the execution grounds and 
executed there. 
  Thief Yu Yongsheng and his partners stole aluminum sheets 
worth more than 120,000 yuan Renminbi and obtained over 35,000 
yuan from disposal of their stolen goods between May and 
December 1992. Robber Chu Huaiyou and his partners drove a 
motorcycle along Hean road and other important roads, and after 
searching, beating up, and threatening their victims, robbed 
trucks with other localities' license plates parked on the side 
of the road of over 8,600 yuan in cash plus some other articles. 
In this way, they committed five robberies. Among the other 
criminals executed were Chen Qiang, who illegally possessing a 
gun and ammunition, eluded capture and committed 28 robberies in 
the past two years; hooligan Du Shaohu who picked a quarrel and 
then beat up and killed an innocent bus passenger; rapist and 
robber Cao Chengtuan; and Chen Yongbao, who stole a weapon to 
commit homicide over of a trifling family quarrel.

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- The electronics 
industry has been booming in the Chinese capital city, making it 
China's fourth largest producer of electronics products, an 
official from the municipal office of the electronics industry 
said. 
  The official said Thursday [19 May] that Beijing turned out 
9.2 billion yuan (about 1.1 billion U.S. dollars) in electronics 
products in 1993, which resulted in 1.8 billion yuan (200 
million U.S. dollars) in profits. 
  The electronics industry was tabbed as one of the three 
pillar industries in Beijing in 1988. Since then, the 
municipality has reorganized more than 10 loss-making 
electronics enterprises to make the best use of resources and 
developed such advanced products as telephone switchboards, 
color tv tubes, color television, microcomputers and video 
cassette recorders. 
  As a result, the city has established itself in the 
development of telecommunications, broadcasting and television, 
computers, electronic circuits and electronic instruments. It 
has also become China's largest producer of telephone 
switchboards and microcomputers. 
  Foreign investment has played an important role in this 
development. Now some 100 foreign-funded electronics joint 
ventures are located in Beijing, bringing in a total investment 
of 65 million U.S. dollars last year alone. 
  Beijing Matsushita Color CRT [Cathode-Ray Tube] Co. Ltd., 
one 
such joint venture, has entered China's 10 best foreign-funded 
enterprise list by producing 1.56 billion yuan in output value. 
A Sino-German joint venture also established itself as the 
largest producer in telephone switchboards in the electronics 
industry. 
  Besides the foreign-funded enterprises, a number of computer 
giants like "Stone," "Jinghai," and "Kehai" are engaged in the 
production of computers, softwares, printers, Xerox machines, 
and fax machines. 
  Board card sales by the "Legend Group," another blue chip 
computer company, make up 10 percent of the international 
market. The Chinese version of "Express Publisher" by the 
Beijing University Founder Group Corporation is hailed as one of 
the top publishing software programs in the world. Currently, 
the software covers 60 percent of China's domestic market and 
has also sold well in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan.

  [Text] In response to an invitation to visit the U.S. 
extended to President Li Teng-hui jointly by Republican Senator 
Murkowski and Senator Brown, an official of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs said: During past years, many U.S. senators and 
congressmen as well as academic organizations have invited 
President Li to visit the United States. But under the U.S. 
system in which administrative, legislative, and judicial 
functions are separate, President Li's visit to the United 
States is possible only when, in addition to the maneuvering on 
the part of Congress, the administrative branch should have good 
will. Given the current policy of the United States, which 
deems mutual visits by high-level officials not in line with its 
interests, President Li's visit to the United States is 
impossible. 
  However, the official said: If there are more voices of 
support, this will put pressure on the U.S. Government. The 
accumulation of such efforts will certainly bloom and produce 
fruits. A case in point is the U.S. arms sales to us. We have 
worked hard on this issue over the past 13 years. Another 
example is our entry to GATT. In the future, we will mobilize 
more people to support us. It is our hope that the U.S. side 
will come to understand that we do not mean to sabotage the 
relations between the United States and Communist China. It is 
hoped that the United States will separately deal with its ties 
with Communist China and its ties with us.

  [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- An official from the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] said 
here today that the country has taken strict measures to protect 
the intellectual property rights [IPR] involved in technology 
imports. 
  These include proprietary technology, technical know-how, 
trademarks and computer software, he said. 
  Addressing the '94 Beijing International Symposium on 
Intellectual Property Protection, Zhao Chunhua, deputy director 
of department of science and technology, said that the measures 
include allowing each foreign software owner to register of his 
own will his software with the China computer software 
registration agency to safeguard his property interests. 
  Meanwhile, the quantity of imports of certain foreign 
computer software that is stipulated in the software license 
contract constitutes the base for China to exercise its 
administration of the domestic market, in order to prohibit and 
punish any acts of imitation or illegal copying of the relevant 
software. 
  According to incomplete statistics, China's trade volume of 
computer software by now has exceeded several hundred million 
U.S. dollars. 
  Zhao Chunhua noted that China has promulgated the patent 
law, 
the law against unfair competition, the trademark law and the 
copyright law, which provide the legal basis to protect 
intellectual property rights involved in technology imports. 
  "Moreover," Zhao said, "regulations on technology imports 
are 
now being deliberated and will soon be formulated." 
  He told the 130-plus participants of the symposium that 
China 
also allows the recipients of technical know-how to conclude, 
before importation, a "secrecy-divulging agreement" with the 
foreign suppliers, to pay necessary expenses and to undertake 
necessary responsibility for keeping secrets. 
  Zhao added that foreign suppliers are also allowed to impose 
necessary and reasonable restrictions on people who have access 
to the know-how, and to place reasonable restrictions on areas 
where the products manufactured with the know-how are sold. 
  In using foreign suppliers' trademarks to produce or market 
products, Chinese recipients are ordered to vindicate the 
reputation of the trademark, while the quality and property of 
the products that are manufactured by the recipient and bear the 
supplier's trademark must conform to the quality and property of 
the products bearing the original trademark. 
  Foreign suppliers also have the right to exercise necessary 
supervision and guidance over the production and marketing of 
the products bearing the suppliers' trademark through proper and 
reasonable means. 
  Zhao pointed out that in the process of importing foreign 
patented technology, the patented technology whose supplier 
fails to provide sufficient proof or guarantee for the validity 
of the right of the patented technology is not permitted to be 
imported into China. 
  Meanwhile, it is stipulated in the contract of patent 
technology imports that recipients of the technology in China 
and foreign technology supplier should conclude contracts 
specifying the scope and duration of the use of the proper 
patent in order to prevent proliferative use of the technology. 
  China also ordered that in the contract of patent technology 
imports, there should be an explicit authorization clause. 
  Zhao Chunhua said that if disputes over intellectual 
property 
involved in technology imports arise, the two parties concerned 
should first negotiate to avoid any hindrance to the smooth 
implementation of the imported technology. 
  "If negotiations or mediation fail," Zhao added, "the two 
sides may request arbitration or start legal proceedings in the 
intellectual property divisions of China's courts." 
  China has so far set up such courts in Beijing, Shanghai, 
Guangdong, Fujian and Hainan. 
  Zhao said that it has been proved that China's courts and 
administrative authorities at various levels have pledged 
continued efforts to enforce the law to the letter and bring to 
justice violators of the intellectual property rights. 
  Moreover, a Sino-U.S. bilateral negotiation agency on 
intellectual property has been set up under the Sino-U.S. joint 
committee on commerce and trade. 
  "It provides a place where some disputes relevant to 
intellectual property of the two countries are exchanged and 
mediated regularly, thus playing a role in mediating and 
settling disputes over intellectual property of the two 
countries," Zhao concluded.

  [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- A senior official at 
the State Copyright Bureau (SCB) today described China "an 
active member of the international copyright community." 
  He cited numerous facts to show that China sets great store 
by protecting the intellectual property rights in line with 
international standards. 
  Shen Rengan, deputy bureau director, noted that under 
China's 
copyright law, works of foreigners first published in China will 
enjoy copyright. 
  The law protects any work of a foreigner published outside 
China which is eligible to enjoy copyright under an agreement 
concluded between the country to which the foreigner belongs and 
China, or under an international treaty to which both countries 
are parties, he said. 
  Addressing an international seminar here on intellectual 
property protection, he said that China makes such protection 
"an important part of the policy of reform and opening to the 
world." 
  Work began in 1979 to draft the law, which was promulgated 
in 
September, 1990 and went into effect in June 1991. 
  "In drafting the law," he said, "judicial organs and the 
drafting group seriously studied the international copyright 
convention and see to it that the law meets the requirements of 
that convention." 
  China became the 93rd country to accede to the Berne 
Convention when it joined in October, 1992 and accordingly, the 
State Council published a set of rules to implement it. 
  That means, he said, that China provides protection to 
authors of all member states of the convention and their works. 
  According to the State Council document, foreign computer 
programs, once imported into China, automatically enjoy 
protection for a period of 50 years, in conformity with 
stipulations of the convention. 
  When foreign works are performed in China, the Chinese users 
are obliged to acquire agreement in advance from the authors and 
duly pay them afterwards. 
  The Copyright Bureau and the Ministry of Finance see to it 
that Chinese users acquire the foreign currency needed to pay 
the owners of the copyrights they have used, he said. 
  The copyright law, he said, "basically conforms to the 
standards of the Berne Convention," but differences do exist. 
"Preparations are under way to revise the law so that it 
conforms entirely to the convention." 
  He added: "China has established a rather complete copyright 
law system and implemented it." 
  Last May, he said, the Enesco Corporation in the state of 
Ohio requested the SCB to investigate and redress a case of 
alleged infringement of its copyright in China. It complained 
that counterfeit copies of its toys were displayed on exhibition 
counters during the Guangzhou Spring Export Commodities Fair. 
  After investigation, the SCB ordered the infringers to stop 
reproducing and selling the counterfeit toys, to turn over all 
the counterfeit toys to the local copyright administration, and 
to pay a fine. 
  "The doors of the Chinese people's courts and the SCB are 
always open," he said. "Anyone who possesses valid copyright 
finds it infringed upon can, and is welcome to bring the case 
before a people's court or the SCB." 
  He admits that some copyrighted works were and still are 
pirated in China, especially books and video works. 
  He said China has spared no efforts in cracking down on 
copyright infringements and will continue to do so. 
  According to shen, the SCB has submitted a draft bill to the 
legislative body to impose criminal sanctions against piracy and 
other serious copyright infringement acts. 
  "In the international copyright community," he said, "China 
is still a relatively young member and therefore, needs the 
assistance of those countries with a more developed copyright 
system."

<F P=106> ["Feature" by Zhao Renfang: "China, The Next Great Business </F>
Frontier"] 
  [Text] New York, May 18 (XINHUA) -- New Jersey, the 
"Garden State" which is separated from New York City by the 
Hudson River, has great advantages in developing its 
international trade. 
  At the 27th conference held by the state's World Trade 
Council, participants saw another new horizon, that is, China at 
the other side of the Pacific Ocean. 
  During the past few years more and more American businessmen 
are targeting China to expand their business. Seizing the right 
time, New Jersey World Trade Council, chose China as its 
conference theme and invited some 500 people from business, 
trade, government and other parties interested in exploring 
U.S.-China business to the meeting on Tuesday [17 May]. 
  The conference, sponsored by the non-profit council, 
received 
great support not only from the American side, but also from the 
Chinese Consulate General in New York and Zhejiang Province of 
China, New Jersey's sister state. Robert P. Evans, chairman of 
the council noted that he held great honor to organize such a 
conference. 
  At the beautiful conference venue called Birchwood Manor in 
Parsippany, New Jersey, governor Christine T. Whitman said the 
conference was a special time and event for her state while 
expressing welcome to Li Daoyu, Chinese ambassador to the United 
States and Ambassador Zhang Weichao, consul general to New York. 
  In a brief interview with XINHUA, she said outreaching was a 
major part of the future of her state and China was a potential 
market of the future, so China was very important for New 
Jersey. "International trade means economic growth," she said. 
  New Jersey, though small in size, sold products worth 11.5 
billion dollars and its export was the 11th last year in the 
United States. With 20 of FORTUNE 500 biggest companies and 12 
biggest service companies within its territory, the garden state 
will greatly develop its export in the future. 
  In the early years of 1980s, New Jersey has become sister 
state with China's Zhejiang Province. To further their 
cooperation, Zhang Qimei, deputy governor, led a 50-member 
delegation to this special and unique opportunity with some 400 
projects seeking partnership. Also at the one-day trade show, 
noted American companies such as AT&amp;T, Citibank and KPMG Peat 
Marwick introduced their products and services to their Chinese 
counterparts. 
  At the conference with the theme "China, The Next Great 
Business Frontier," participants featured presentations focusing 
on the business, investment, trade, legal, economic and 
social-political climate in China and agreed there existed great 
opportunities. 
  Commenting on the conference, a senior Chinese conferee who 
attended lots of symposiums on China said it's rare to see such 
a professional conference which attracted so many American 
businessmen. The Chinese companies should go deep into American 
main stream society to do their business in this way. 
  Just as Ambassador Zhang Weichao noted that this conference 
was very unique and unprecedented in the way that it had chosen 
China as the theme country. The large turn-out was also 
unprecedented. 
  "It fully reflects the great enthusiasm and desire among the 
both business communities in exploring business opportunities 
and in strengthening bilateral cooperation." he added. 
  Since the conference was convened at the very moment before 
the Clinton administration to decide whether to unconditionally 
renew China's most favored nation (MFN) status, most of the 
people at the meeting called for the separation of the issue 
from other unrelated matters. They also expressed their support 
for China's MFN status. 
  Delivering an international luncheon address in the 
afternoon, Ambassador Li Daoyu thanked those people who made 
their efforts in developing Sino-U.S. trade and business 
relations and hoped that they make further efforts to help 
settle the issue. 
  "China, The Next Great Business Frontier" was the theme of 
the meeting and also the desire of most participants at the 
meeting. While driving back on the Garden State Parkway to New 
York, this reporter also hoped that meetings of this kind will 
pave another "highway," which can carry more American 
businessmen, just like the speeding cars rushing by, to do their 
business with China. The desire is there, but more efforts 
would help their dreams come true.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Li Jiasheng: "India, U.S. Promote </F>
Economic Ties"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, May 20 (XINHUA) -- Indian Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao's six-day official working visit to the United 
States has shown that despite political differences between 
them, both sides attached greater importance to their economic 
ties. 
  During his stay in the United States, Rao met chief 
executives of major corporations and had talks with them about 
Indian economic reforms and mutual economic cooperation, seeking 
to convince everyone that the change in India was irreversible. 
  Despite the fact that Rao and U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
summit involved some political differences, they did not allow 
them to shadow their intention to strengthen economic ties. 
  Clinton recently has called for a pragmatic approach towards 
the strain in Indo-U.S. relations over the situation in Kashmir 
and human right standards in India. He said that political 
differences ought not to color the gamut of Indo-U.S. ties. 
  He said India's on-going economic reforms offered exciting 
possibilities for "our bilateral trade and economic relations." 
  For the U.S. companies, a major attraction in India is its 
large untapped market of 200 middle-class consumers and a 
growing industrial sector with an insatiable appetite for modern 
technology and infrastructure. 
  In the short span of two years, multinational giants like 
General Motors, IBM, and Coca Cola have already invested over 
800 million U.S. dollars in India. 
  Since 1991 when Rao came to power and pursued an economic 
reform policy, Indo-U.S. economic ties had made a great leap 
forward despite their differences on Kashmir, human rights, 
nuclear non- proliferation, etc. The U.S. exports to India had 
risen from 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in 1992 to 2.4 billion in 
1993, a 38 percent increase over the same period in 1992. 
India's exports to the U.S. had increased from 3.8 billion in 
1992 to 4.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1993. 
  And the U.S. investment also made big progress in the past 
few years with an increase of more than 1.1 billion U.S. dollars 
in 1993 from less than 20 million U.S. dollars in 1990. Nearly 
half of all investment approvals by the Indian Government last 
year were from the U.S. companies while the value of the U.S. 
investment last year exceeded the total of all previous years' 
since India's independence in 1947. 
  After the disintegration of the former Soviet Union and the 
end of Cold War, India shifted its foreign policy from 
dependence on the Soviet Union to dimensional one. Rao's 
economic reform in 1991 had made India to stress economic 
diplomacy which focused on the Western countries, especially the 
United States. 
  As India needs American investment and modern technology, 
Rao 
has time and again said that political differences should not 
prevent India and the U.S. from developing friendly relations. 
  When all is said and done, both India and the U.S. are 
optimistic about their future economic relations and agreed to 
continue dialogue over their differences.

  [Text] Washington, May 20 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Indian Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao today 
called for the creation of "a new partnership" between India and 
the United States. 
  This came in a joint statement, released here today by the 
Indian Embassy, was issued at the end of the Indian Prime 
Minister Rao's visit in the United States. 
  The two leaders promised to cooperate in the search for 
solutions to global challenges posed by weapons of mass 
destruction, AIDS, environmental degradation, population growth, 
poverty, international terrorism and narcotics trafficking, the 
statement said. 
  Rao, who arrived in the United States on May 14, has met 
with 
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and acting Secretary 
of State Strobe Talbott in Washington, and wound up his visit 
yesterday. 
  It was the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to the 
United States since 1987. 
  Agreement on the wording of the joint statement was reached 
Thursday [19 May] evening, hours after Clinton and Rao held a 
joint news conference at the White House. 
  "The President and the prime minister agreed to expand the 
pace and scope of high-level exchange on the full range of 
political, economic, commercial, scientific, technological and 
social issues," the statement said. 
  Clinton praised Prime Minister Rao's economic reforms and 
noted that the enthusiastic response of the business communities 
in both countries has produced record levels of bilateral trade 
and investment. 
  Recognizing the potential to build a strong and positive 
economic relationship, both leaders agreed to work to remove 
impediments that exist to bilateral commerce. 
  Seeking to demonstrate agreement on goals, the statement 
said 
that the two leaders offered their strong support for efforts 
towards the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and their means 
of delivery. 
  At the joint news conference yesterday, Clinton acknowledged 
the two nations have some difference on human rights and nuclear 
non-proliferation. 
  The statement also said that Clinton and Rao agreed on the 
need for bilateral negotiations between India and Pakistan to 
resolve outstanding issues including Kashmir.

<F P=106> ['Round-Up' by Li Guorong: Rao's Visit Improves Ties With </F>
U.S.] 
  [Text] New Delhi, May 21 (XINHUA) -- Indian Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao returned here today from a six-day visit to the 
United States, which improved the atmosphere of bilateral ties 
between the two countries. 
  The visit resulted in the two countries overcoming their 
reservations and establishing a durable framework for building a 
new partnership despite continuing differences over many issues. 
  U.S. President Clinton has emphasized that the United States 
has a high stake in improving its relationship with India. 
  Indian Prime Minister Rao said that his discussions with 
President Clinton convinced him that India and the U.S. can 
develop a bilateral relationship of maturity and strength that 
can contribute not only to mutual good but also to the world as 
a whole. 
  During his visit, Rao has successfully put India back on 
Washington's economic agenda and conceded nothing on issues like 
the non-proliferation, human rights and its position on the 
Kashmir problem. 
  The bilateral dialogue will continue as Washington remains 
unconvinced by the Indian argument that it can not sign the 
"discriminatory" nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  On the Kashmir issue, the U.S. position is now closer to the 
Indian stand as U.S. President B. Clinton said that it is for 
India and Pakistan to get together and resolve it, without 
mentioning the will of the Kashmir people this time. 
  Adding to the happiness of the Indians, President Clinton 
said that he has an open mind on the possibility of India 
acquiring permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council -- 
something the Indians have long been seeking. 
  A distinct possibility of defence relationship including 
joint exercises has emerged following discussions with U.S. 
Defence Secretary William Perry. 
  India's emphasis on the positive aspects of the economic 
relationship was also endorsed by Clinton when he said that 
India's important reform plan will be the engine of growth in 
the relations between the two countries. 
  U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown is to visit India in 
November to discuss how to promote growth in trade and 
investment. 
  It has been agreed to revitalize the Indo-U.S. joint 
commission of 1974, to establish regular foreign office 
consultations between the two countries as well as to upgrade 
cooperation in science and technology. 
  The revitalization of the Indo-U.S. joint commission to be 
chaired by the Indian foreign minister and U.S. secretary of 
state is viewed here as U.S. recognition of the potential for 
building a positive economic relationship with India. 
  The commission is to have four sub-commissions on education 
and culture, science and technology, agriculture and economics 
and commerce. 
  The revival will begin with a meeting between finance 
secretaries of the two countries before the end of the year, 
according to Indian Foreign Secretary K. Srinivasan.

  [Text] Moscow, May 21 (XINHUA) -- Russia said on Friday [20 
May] that it has approved a new partnership deal with NATO that 
would take into account Russia's special status. 
  The ITAR-TASS News Agency quoted Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev as saying that Russia would join the "Partnership 
for Peace" program NATO has offered former Soviet Republics only 
if NATO approves Russia's proposals. 
  The approval came after the 16-member NATO offered a 
"special 
partnership" to Russia on Wednesday to encourage the country to 
join its "partnership for peace" program. 
  "Russia is interested in a more serious and substantive form 
of relations with NATO than envisaged by the Partnership for 
Peace program," said Grachev, who is due to visit NATO next week. 
  Russia has insisted that the "Partnership for Peace" does 
not 
offer Russia the status it deserves as a big nuclear power. 
  Reports quoted President Boris Yeltsin as saying NATO may 
acknowledge Russia's special status in a protocol within the 
framework of the "partnership for peace" or in a separate 
bilateral document. 
  Grachev said he intends to submit Russia's new vision of 
European security at next Tuesday's meeting of NATO and former 
Warsaw Pact defense ministers in Brussels. 
  According to ITAR-TASS, Grachev will also make a report on 
provisions of Russia's military doctrine, which was approved in 
November 1993.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Ruichang (0491 3843 1603)] </F>
  [Text] Bridgetown, 5 May (XINHUA) -- At the "Global 
Conference on Sustainable Development for Developing Islet 
Nations" -- a UN high-level meeting held in Bridgetown, the 
capital of Barbados -- on 5 May, Liu Chengguo, head of the 
Chinese Government delegation, pointed out that the principle 
defined at this meeting for the establishment of partnership for 
sustainable development should become the basis of international 
cooperation in the fields of environment and development. 
  Liu Chengguo believes that the sustainable development of 
developing islet nations is an important element of global 
sustainable development. Developing islet nations' efforts to 
develop their economy and protect the environment are 
contributing to attaining the goal of worldwide sustainable 
development. 
  Speaking of ways to establish this kind of partnership for 
sustainable development, Liu Chengguo said that it should be 
built on mutual respect and equal treatment. He said: All 
countries -- big or small, strong or weak -- should be equal 
partners in international cooperation; the basis for cooperation 
comes only in this way. Partnership will be out of the question 
if either side should indiscreetly criticize the other at every 
turn, always try to force on the other a certain model or 
policies and measures suited to some other countries, or even 
take monetary or technical aid as political chips for putting 
forward unreasonable demands regarding the recipient country's 
internal affairs. 
  Liu Chengguo said: This kind of partnership should also 
closely link the resolution of global environmental problems 
with that of practical problems facing developing islet nations, 
and help developing islet nations attain the two complementary 
goals of sustained economic growth and environmental protection. 
  Liu Chengguo pointed out: This kind of partnership should 
embody the principle of "common but differentiated 
responsibilities." He said: Climatic changes, rising sea 
levels, pollution of ocean and seacoast, and other environmental 
problems are not caused chiefly by islet nations, but they have 
become the first victims of them. Many problems left over from 
the colonial or trusteeship periods continue to restrict their 
social and economic development. To effectively resolve the 
environmental problems facing developing islet nations and help 
them attain sustainable development, therefore, the 
international community, particularly the developed nations, 
should make more commitments. 
  In conclusion, Liu Chengguo said: Being a developing nation, 
China understands very well the difficulties facing developing 
islet nations and sympathizes with them. China has established 
friendly relations and cooperation with many developing islet 
nations and is ready to further and actively explore and 
strengthen multilevel South-South cooperation in various forms 
in the hope of bringing about common development and prosperity. 
  The United Nations began the "Global Conference on 
Sustainable Development for Developing Islet Nations" on 25 
April. Government delegates from China and about 100 other 
member states of the United Nations attended the meeting. Held 
after the UN conference on environment and development in 1992, 
this meeting has the special purpose of resolving developing 
islet nations' peculiar environmental and development problems.

"Vice Minister of State Economic and Trade Commission Yu 
Xiaosong Expresses Optimism About Extension of MFN Status"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 May (TA KUNG PAO) -- Yu Xiaosong, vice 
minister of China's State Economic and Trade Commission, said 
today that he is optimistic about the extension by the United 
States of most-favored-nation [MFN] status for China. 
  In reply to a reporter's question about the U.S. extension 
of 
MFN status for China, Yu Xiaosong -- who was attending a 
Beijing-Hong Kong economy and trade luncheon meeting -- said 
today that he was optimistic about the extension. Even if the 
MFN status is revoked this year, it will have to be restored 
next year. After all, Sino- U.S. relations are an important 
part of world relations, he said, and if Sino-U.S. relations 
come to a deadlock, the rift will have to be mended by the 
politicians of the next generation, since it will not be easy 
for this generation to do so. 
  Yu Xiaosong stressed that a deadlock, first of all, would be 
unfavorable to the United States. Sino-U.S. relations cannot 
come to a deadlock. Whichever side causes the deadlock will 
have to bear the historical responsibility, and the politicians 
of that side will have to undertake the mission to mend the rift. 
  Yu recalled that there were no ties between China and the 
United States in 1972, when former U.S. President Nixon and 
former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger paid their visit to 
China. In addition, China and the United States had been at war 
with each other, but at that time both sides felt the need to 
normalize relations between them. Then why should something be 
done to deadlock the relations today? he asked. 
  He stressed that China, for its part, does not want the 
relations to come to a deadlock, but some people in the United 
States do intend to cause a deadlock. 
  He said many Americans and politicians do not know about 
China, so it is necessary to make more efforts to convince them 
and to explain the situation to them. 
  He said China should have been granted permanent MFN status. 
China now has met all the requirements set out by the United 
States in this regard, but the United States wants to add some 
extra requirements, which are not provided for by U.S. law.

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- The so-called evidence 
produced by a Harry Wu on Wednesday [18 May] to prove that China 
has continued to export prison-labor products to the United 
States is entirely false, a government official said here today. 
  A leading official of the Chinese judicial department said 
that according to yesterday's WASHINGTON POST and WASHINGTON 
TIMES, Harry Wu said at a news conference on may 15 that the 
Shandong United Steel Tube Company in East China's Shandong 
Province had shipped 180,000 pounds of steel tubes to two 
Florida-based subsidiaries of the Waxmon Company of the United 
States. 
  Wu claimed that the Chinese company is a "prison-labor 
factory." 
  The official said that the fact is that the company, based 
in 
the coastal city of Qingdao, is a subsidiary of the Shandong 
Provincial Branch of the China Foreign Trade Transportation 
Corporation. 
  The factory is by no means a "prison-labor factory" and has 
never exported steel tubes to the United States, he added. 
  Harry Wu also claimed at the news conference that the 
Houston- based Cosmos Trading Company of the U.S. had imported 
hardware and tools from the Shenda Tools Factory based in 
Hangzhou, the capital of east China's Zhejiang Province. 
  He argued that the factory had "2,000 prisoners." 
  The official said that the factory, built in 1991 is by no 
means a prison-labor factory, but a factory attached to the 
Zhejiang Provincial Department of the Machine-Building Industry. 
  The factory manufactures all kinds of manual tools and 
employs 400 people, none of whom is a prisoner, he added. 
  Harry Wu also claimed that he had taken pictures and videos 
of prisoner-made toys, hardware and Christmas tree decoration 
lights. 
  According to the official, everyone knows that such goods 
are 
available all over China. "So how can Wu's pictures and videos 
prove that these goods are prison-labor products?" he asked. 
  Harry Wu boasted that he had collected "evidence" in 26 
prison- labor factories in China. 
  The official said that in fact, he had not entered any 
prison 
in China, but had just taken pictures and videos at a distance 
outside prisons. 
  Then Wu montaged these videos with what he had taken in 
streets to spread sensational rumors, in an attempt to deceive 
the general public, he noted. 
  The official said that the Chinese Government was 
conscientious in implementing a memorandum of understanding 
between the Chinese and American Governments on banning the 
import and export of prison- labor products. 
  Not long ago, officials of the U.S. Embassy in China visited 
three reform-through-labor units in Guangdong Province, he said, 
adding that they were now visiting another two such units in 
Zhejiang Province. 
  "Sino-American cooperation in this regard is now proceeding 
smoothly," he said. 
  "At this time, Harry Wu and others are repeatedly spreading 
rumors everywhere, with their ulterior motives all too clear," 
he said.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "892000060040f U.S. Companies Want MFN Renewed"] </F>
  [Text] American businesses in Beijing and Shanghai support 
the unconditional extension of most-favoured-nation (MFN) status 
to China according to a recent poll. 
  Over 89 percent of U.S. companies surveyed by the American 
Chamber of Commerce in Beijing said they backed the extension of 
MFN. 
  And more than half said MFN should be permanent, rather than 
under annual review. 
  The poll, conducted last month under the supervision of 
Gallup (China) Survey Company, covered 104 American companies in 
Beijing and Shanghai. 
  About 11 percent of companies declined to comment on MFN. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has until June 3 to decide 
whether or under what terms to extend MFN to China for 1994. 
  The report said 85 percent of companies think their business 
will be affected if the preferential trade status is revoked or 
changed. 
  If it fails to get renewed, 48.1 percent said they would 
suffer severe losses. 
  The other half said it was hard to predict the impact on 
their business. But 13.5 percent believed the denial of MFN 
would affect them for two or three years. 
Negative Effect [subhead] 
  About 17 percent said the negative effect would only last a 
year or two. 
  Still, 11.5 percent of companies were optimistic, saying the 
shadowy period would last less than a year. 
  Nearly half of the companies said the removal of MFN would 
cause Chinese and American firms to cut staff, but a third 
disagreed. 
  On human rights, more than 70 percent of respondents opposed 
linking human rights to the MFN issue. Only one per cent of 
companies regard the linkage as effective. 
  The report said most American companies are afraid the 
cancellation of MFN will play right into the hands of rivals 
from other countries competing in the China market. 
  Over 66 percent of companies were worried about losing 
ground 
to competitors. 
  There was also a strong feeling that competition will obtain 
more favourable tariff treatment in China. 
  The Americans also fear the annual review of MFN will 
increase their business risks in China.

  [Text] Beijing, May 22 (XINHUA) -- China and Russia are to 
hold the second meeting of the Sino-Russian Committee on 
Economic, Trade, Scientific and Technological Cooperation here 
from Tuesday [24 May] to Thursday. 
  The two sides will exchange opinions on furthering bilateral 
cooperation in the four areas. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Russian Deputy Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin will co-chair the meeting. 
  China and Russia are neighbors highly complementary to each 
other in terms of economy and enjoy economic and trade 
cooperation in many fields, according to Geng Xuncai, deputy 
director of the European Affairs Department of China's Ministry 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). 
  He said that bilateral economic and trade ties are 
developing 
rapidly, with last year's trade volume reaching 7.7 billion U.S. 
dollars, an increase of 31 percent over 1992. 
  In addition, means of bilateral economic and trade are 
diversifying with the development of barter trade, cash trade, 
compensation trade, entrepot trade, leasing, project engineering 
and labor services. 
  He said that the Chinese Government maintains an active 
attitude towards the development of Sino-Russian trade and such 
cooperation has a bright prospect. 
  In general trade, using its main foreign trade channels such 
as large trade corporations, the Chinese side will seize the 
opportunity to press for a gradual shift from the dominant 
barter trade to cash trade with involvement of all foreign trade 
means. 
  He said that the Chinese side will continue to stress the 
role of border and regional economic and trade cooperation, 
further strengthening administration over such cooperation and 
the standardization of commodities inspection, in a bid to 
better facilitate the development of such cooperation and 
two-way investment. 
  In scientific and technological cooperation, he said that 
China hopes for extending cooperation to such high-tech fields 
as aviation, space technology, medical sciences, chemical 
industry and machine-building. 
  He added that the problem of communications constitutes an 
obstacle in bilateral trade, hoping that the two countries will 
make full use of land transportation, along with the proper 
development of sea transportation. 
  He said that he believes the coming meeting will accelerate 
the development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation.

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (AFP)--North Korea was obliged to 
begin extracting fuel rods from its Yongbyon reactor for safety 
reasons and because of Washington's refusal to resume talks on 
the nuclear issue, the North Korean ambassador to China said 
Friday. 
  The United States had failed to honour pledges to provide 
North Korea with a light water reactor and to hold a third round 
of talks with Pyongyang following their last meeting in Geneva 
in July, Ambassador Chu Chang-chun said. As a result 
"replacement of the fuel rods could not be delayed any longer 
because of safety considerations," Chu told a press conference. 
  Chu stressed that Pyongyang had, on four occasions, informed 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in advance of its 
intention to replace the rods. It was therefore unfair for the 
agency to criticise North Korea for going ahead, he said. 
  The IAEA said Thursday that its inspectors currently in 
North 
Korea had confirmed that replacement had begun in "serious 
violation" of IAEA inspection terms, and said it would report 
the action to the UN Security Council. 
  The agency called on North Korea to stop immediately any 
further withdrawal of the rods, saying that as of Thursday it 
would still be possible to implement required safety measures so 
as to verify whether any fuel has been diverted. However, Chu 
indicated that such verification would be dependent on a 
resumption of talks between Washington and Pyongyang. 
  "We will keep the fuel rods in a safe place and seal them 
for 
the inspectors so they can verify that nuclear materials have 
not been diverted for non-peaceful purposes," he said. 
  "When the next round of talks between North Korea and the 
United States is held and a technical solution is realised, then 
the agency can take measurements at any time." 
  Washington suspects the reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles) 
north of Pyongyang, is a nuclear bomb factory, and wants the 
IAEA to check whether North Korea has been diverting 
weapons-grade plutonium to manufacture a device. 
  In a further indication that Pyongyang had no intention of 
immediately halting the replacement procedure, Chu said the 
process "is under way and will last about two months."

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 KYODO -- North Korea on Friday [20 
May] rejected demands by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) that it halt removal of spent fuel rods without proper 
inspections at an experimental nuclear reactor 90 kilometers 
north of Pyongyang. 
  North Korean Ambassador to China Chu Chang-chun told 
reporters that a resolution of the issue would be conditioned on 
resumption of bilateral talks with the United States, suspended 
after two rounds last July. 
  "When the third round of talks between the DPRK (North 
Korea) 
and the U.S. are held and a package solution is realized, then 
the agency (IAEA) can take the measurements at any time," he 
said. 
  Earlier in the day, the IAEA confirmed that despite its 
warnings, North Korea had started removing spent fuel rods from 
its 5-megawatt experimental reactor without IAEA inspectors 
present. 
  The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said it has sent a letter 
to 
North Korea, warning that further removal of the rods without 
proper inspections would be a violation of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and safeguard agreements concluded 
between North Korea and the IAEA. 
  The IAEA demanded the operations be suspended until 
arrangements can be made to ensure the rods are properly marked 
and separated for sampling. 
  The three IAEA inspectors now at the Yongbyon nuclear 
complex 
since Wednesday have not been allowed to take samples or make 
tests on the spent rods. 
  The IAEA has insisted that the rods must be sorted and 
examined to see whether plutonium has been diverted for a 
nuclear weapons program. 
  Without the samples, the IAEA has said it will not be able 
to 
determine whether North Korea has complied with a nuclear 
safeguards agreement. 
  The Vienna-based agency said it is preparing to dispatch 
another delegation of experts to North Korea to discuss 
safeguards measures. 
  U.S. officials have said that spent fuel currently being 
withdrawn from the reactor could provide enough plutonium to 
build four or five atomic bombs. 
  Refusal to comply with the IAEA's demands would also raise 
the possibility the watchdog agency will refer the problem to 
the U.N. Security Council, which could impose economic sanctions. 
  On Thursday, U.S. President Bill Clinton reacted cautiously 
to reports that Pyongyang has begun removing spent fuel rods 
without the presence of international inspectors. 
  "I want to know what the facts are, and when I do, then I 
will make a more definite statement," he told reporters. 
  Clinton called it "an error" for North Korea to thwart IAEA 
inspections after it had agreed to comply with them. 
  A South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed regret 
and concern Friday that North Korea has already begun removing 
the rods in defiance of international demands not to do so. 
  Seoul also urged Pyongyang to immediately resume talks with 
the IAEA to discuss matters of full compliance with their 
nuclear safeguards agreement. 
  "South Korea will consult closely with allies about what 
steps it will take, watching the result of talks between North 
Korea and the IAEA," the spokesman said. 
  Meanwhile, Pyongyang's official KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY 
(KCNA) quoted North Korean President Kim Il-song as saying in a 
recent interview, "we feel no need to develop nuclear weapons 
and even if we were to manufacture one or two of them, they 
would be useless." 
  North Korea insists its nuclear power program is only for 
peaceful purposes, but refusal to comply with inspection demands 
has aroused suspicions that it may be trying to build an atomic 
bomb. 
  A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on condition 
of anonymity, told reporters in Washington that the U.S. will 
drop its "patient diplomacy" if Pyongyang is found to have 
cheated on nuclear inspections. 
  "We're prepared to consider other options," he said, adding 
that the U.S. sees an advantage in exhausting diplomatic means 
to persuade the North Koreans to give up their alleged nuclear 
development before applying sanctions. 
  The U.S. has indicated it would pursue economic sanctions 
against Pyongyang through the United Nations or together with 
Japan and South Korea if the nuclear program is not made more 
transparent. 
  Pyongyang has said it would consider sanctions an act of 
war.

friendship and with firm conviction exerted positive efforts for 
the realization of normalizing Sino-Japanese relations and for 
the conclusion of a friendship treaty between the two countries, 
said the messages. 
  He also made outstanding contributions to the development of

  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 22 (XINHUA) -- King Norodom 
Sihanouk of Cambodia will meet Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan 
on May 25 in Beijing, the Khmer Rouge -- or Democratic Kampuchea 
-- representative office here said today. 
  Khieu, who will be attending a round-table meeting on 
Cambodia in Pyongyang from May 27 to 30, will fly to Beijing on 
May 25 to attend a dinner hosted by Sihanouk, said a spokesman 
for the office, who added that Khieu had thanked Sihanouk for 
the invitation. 
  Meanwhile, Sihanouk today urged the four participants in the 
round-table meeting in Pyongyang to agree upon an unconditional 
and immediate ceasefire and to pledge their commitment to unity. 
  In a letter to the participants sent from his residence in 
Beijing, Sihanouk said that he is not trying to "impose a 
political solution to the bloody and tragic `problem' existing 
between the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic 
Kampuchea Party." 
  "I would like to implore you to accept, while in short of a 
political solution, an unconditional, immediate, total and 
irreversible ceasefire across Cambodia," said Sihanouk. 
  He suggested that the ceasefire be supervised by an 
inter-Cambodian commission of control, to be formed of a number 
of army officers from both sides of the conflict, and headed by 
two neutral generals representing Sihanouk himself -- General 
Oum Mannorine and General Buor Holl. 
  He also called on the participants in the round-table 
meeting 
to sign a declaration pledging themselves to national unity, 
territorial integrity based on the 1963-69 border, and "our 
national ideals of peace, national unity and progress." 
  "We will continue to do all we can to find a peaceful and 
political solution to the 'problem' which still divides the 
Royal Government of Cambodia and the Democratic Kampuchea 
Party," said Sihanouk. 
  The four participants in the round table meeting will be 
Chea 
Sim, president of the Cambodian National Assembly, Norodom 
Ranariddh and Hun Sen, the two co-prime ministers of the royal 
government, and Khieu Samphan, president of the Democratic 
Kampuchea Party, or the Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] RENMIN RIBAO reports in its 20 May issue that (Chen 
Bing-qian), spokesman for the (Hai Heng) Petroleum General 
Corportion of China, told the press that on 25 April, a 
Vietnamese newspaper carried an article under the headline: 
Protest Against the Creston Energy Company's Illegal Actions in 
the Tu Chinh Reef -- which is in fact the Wanan reef of China's 
Nansha archipelago -- Which is Under Vietnamese Sovereignty. 
The newspaper claims that the signing of a contract for oil and 
gas exploration in the Wananbei-21 area between the Creston 
Company of the United States and the (Hai Heng) Petroleum 
General Corporation of China constitutes a violation of 
Vietnamese sovereignty. It also demands the cancellation of the 
contract and an end to all contract-related activities. 
  In 1992, the (Hai Heng) Petroleum General Corporation of 
China and the Creston Company of the United States signed the 
Wananbei-21 contract. This contract has legal authority. The 
Wananbei-21 contract area lies within the Nansha archipelago 
under Chinese sovereignty. The contract area is 25,155 square 
km. The exploratory period under the terms of the contract is 
seven years. During the period of contract, the contractor 
concerned is resonsible for conducting seismic surveys and 
exploratory drilling. The (Hai Heng) Petroleum General 
Corporation of China and the Creston Company of the United 
States have the right to carry out their normal tasks in that 
sea area. 
  The (Hai Heng) Petroleum General Corporation entirely 
rejects 
Vietnam's aforementioned criticism and its absurd demand. 
  It should be pointed out here that in recent years, the 
Vietnamese Oil and Gas Corporation has zoned off a number of 
lots in China's Nansha Sea area and invited bidding from other 
countries. Some foreign companies have signed contracts with it 
for oil and gas exploitation. This constitutes a violation not 
only of Chinese sovereignty in the Nansha Sea area but also of 
the interests of the (Hai Heng) Petroleum General Corporation of 
China. 
  The Chinese Government has on several occasions pointed out 
that, pending the settlement of the dispute over the Nansha 
issue, [the parties concerned] may temporarily set aside the 
dispute and join in exploitation efforts. Therefore, the (Hai 
Heng) Petroleum General Corporation of China will welcome any 
efforts of the relevant corporations, including the Vietnamese 
Oil and Gas Corporation, to cooperate with it in seeking the 
possibilities of a joint oil exploitation. 
  The spokesman said: The (Hai Heng) Petroleum General 
Corporation of China requests the Vietnamese Oil and Gas 
Corporation to stop all acts that violate the legal interests of 
the two aforementioned companies.

  [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, standing 
committee member of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said here today

importance to the traditional friendship between the two peoples

  He made these remarks at a meeting with a party and 
government delegation from the Ho Chi Minh City led by Vo Tran 
Chi, member of the Political Bureau of the Vietnamese Communist 
Party Central Committee and secretary of the city party 
committee here this morning. 
  Hu, also member of the secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee, noted that with growing contacts between the Chinese 
and Vietnamese communist parties over the past few years, some 
delegations of the two parties have exchanged their visits and 
experience on the party work. 
  This will not only benefit the growth of the relations 
between the two parties, conform to their common aspirations and 
but also further bilateral friendly ties and cooperation. 
  Vo briefed Hu on the delegation's visit to Guangdong, 
Hangzhou, Shanghai and Suzhou, adding that the delegation is 
deeply impressed by the rapid development of China's economy and 
has gained much inspiration from China's experience in reform 
and opening to the outside world. 
  Hu expressed his appreciation for the strengthening of 
friendly cooperation between the city of Ho Chi Minh and the 
city of Shanghai and his hope that the two sides will work hard 
and take positive measures so as to enable bilateral cooperation 
and exchanges to develop in a smooth and healthy way. 
  Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of 
the CPC Central Committee, participated in the meeting. 
  The delegation arrived here on May 19 at the invitation of 
the Chinese Communist Party.

  [Excerpt] Copenhagen, 16 May (XINHUA) -- Business circles 
attended a luncheon on 16 May here in honor of Li Ruihuan, 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]. 
  Li Ruihuan first briefed them on the achievements China has 
scored in implementing the policy of reform and opening up to 
the outside world. He said: The sustained and rapid growth of 
the Chinese economy has opened up broad prospects for economic 
cooperation and trade with foreign countries. It is estimated 
that the total volume of China's imports in the remaining seven 
years of this century will top $1 trillion U.S., thus providing 
an excellent opportunity for all countries, business circles of 
Denmark included, to carry out economic cooperation and trade 
with China. He said that Danish businesses are welcome to take 
part in China's economic development and he wished them greater 
successes in the Chinese market. 
  Officials of close to 10 noted Danish businesses gave 
briefings on their experience in economic cooperation and trade 
with China. They spoke highly of the tremendous economic 
progress China has made in recent years and noted that they 
would work to expand cooperation and promote economic relations 
and trade between the two nations. 
  In the afternoon, Li Ruihuan toured the noted Kasper [name 
as 
received] Brewery on invitation. Accompanied by the group's 
general manager Michael Yir, Li Ruihuan viewed the brewery's 
beer production and bottling facilities and heard a briefing on 
the brewery. [passage omitted].

  [Text] Brussels, 19 May (XINHUA) -- Belgian Prime Minister 
Jean-Luc Dehaene on 19 May met Li Ruihuan, visiting chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference. The two sides expressed satisfaction 
over the very successful economic and trade cooperation between 
China and Belgium, and hoped for long-term and stable 
development of friendly ties and cooperation between the two 
countries. 
  Dehaene said: Belgium and China enjoy friendly ties, the 
exchange of high-level visits between them increased in recent 
years, and Belgium's investments in China have continued to 
expand and have produced good results. The past few years saw 
China's economy develop very rapidly, and this will produce a 
major impact on the Asian region. We attach importance to and 
appreciate China's constructive role in the UN Security Council. 
  Dehaene was confident that Li Ruihuan's visit would promote 
continuous development of Sino-Belgian ties in political, 
economic, and other fields. 
  Li Ruihuan said one of the main aims of his tour to Belgium 
and four other north European nations is to learn from and draw 
on experiences which will benefit China. China hopes to develop 
long- term and stable friendships and cooperative ties with 
other countries in the world, as this will promote modernization 
in China and contribute to world peace and development. 
  Li Ruihuan said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out that 
we must absorb and draw lessons from all fruits of civilization 
created by human societies, including advanced science and 
technology and experiences in management and administration from 
advanced capitalist countries. This is a thesis which is full 
of foresight. The thesis is extremely important in that it 
offers guidance on China's reform, opening up, and modernization 
and the way China conducts exchanges with foreign countries and 
handles issues concerning international relations. 
  He pointed out: Experiences of mankind include direct and 
indirect experiences. From the vertical perspective, human 
knowledge means inheritance, but from the horizontal 
perspective, it means drawing on experiences. A country which 
stands still and refuses to make progress, closes itself to 
international intercourse, and refuses to accept useful things 
from other countries will be left behind by the trend of the 
times. 
  He said: In the past century or so, the Chinese nation fully 
suffered from imperialist aggression and plundering. It had no 
choice but to devote its main energies on national liberation 
and was unable to concentrate its energies on economic 
construction. Thus, it lost a lot of precious time and fell far 
behind developed nations in the West in economics, science, and 
technology. 
  With the implementation of reform and opening up, we have 
marched into the world, entered the international market, and 
continued to absorb and draw on experiences which benefit us 
from all countries. We have not only accelerated our 
development, we have also made corresponding contributions to 
the international community. 
  Li Ruihuan said emphatically: We must not forget that in the 
history of development stretching over thousands of years, the 
Chinese nation accumulated a very rich cultural heritage, and 
that a complete set of fine traditions took shape despite its 
having to go through nearly a century of struggle. We must 
greatly treasure these good things, and care must be taken to 
preserve them and carry them forward. Only by preserving our 
good things and absorbing good things from other countries are 
we "adding one good thing to another" and making ourselves 
better. This is just what we have often said: Learn from other 
people's good points, carry forward our good qualities, absorb 
the strong points from various people, and follow our own path. 
  Today, Li Ruihuan also met Robert Urbain, Belgium minister 
of 
foreign trade [and European affairs]. The two sides praised the 
smooth development of bilateral economic and trade ties. 
  Li Ruihuan said: Sino-Belgian economic and trade cooperation 
developed rather rapidly in recent years. The two countries' 
economies are highly complementary to each other. There is 
great potential and broad prospects for the two sides to conduct 
mutually beneficial cooperation. We are willing to work 
together with the Belgian side to push bilateral economic and 
trade ties to a new stage of development. 
  Urbain said: China has made remarkable success in economic 
development. The Belgian Government attaches much importance to 
the development of economic and trade ties with China. It is 
ready to continue strengthening friendship and cooperation with 
China. It believes that Li Ruihuan's visit to Belgium will 
promote bilateral ties, particularly further development in 
bilateral economic and trade ties.

  [Text] Brussels, 19 May (XINHUA) -- Visiting Li Ruihuan, 
chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, met with Belgian National 
Bank Governor Verplaetse here today. They held cordial and 
friendly talks. 
  Verplaetse extended a warm welcome to Li Ruihuan's visit to 
Belgium, and enthusiastically commended China on its major 
achievements in reform and opening up. He said: China's rapid 
and sustained economic development has made China "a model of 
economic miracles in the Far East." 
  CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan indicated: Since carrying out 
reform and opening up, China has truly made satisfactory 
progress in developing its economy. However, it has also 
encountered some problems in the process. To resolve these 
problems, China needs to not only establish and improve laws and 
regulations and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control, 
it also needs to improve qualities of all the Chinese people and 
to enhance all its nationalities' adaptability. 
  Li Ruihuan said: China is a country with a lot of people and 
it has a very arduous task to develop its economy. Therefore, 
while facing the need to import advanced Western technology and 
equipment, it also needs to learn from Western countries' 
experiences in regulating and controlling the market. He 
expressed the hope that Sino-Belgian bankers will increase 
bilateral exchanges and promote economic and trade cooperation 
between the two countries.

"Together Open Up a New Vista of Sino-Belgian Cooperation -- Li 
Ruihuan Visits Belgium's Brynar (name as received) 
Pharmaceutical Research Center"] 
  [Excerpts] Brussels, 19 May (XINHUA) -- May is the rainy 
season in Belgium. Nevertheless, when Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National 
Committee, arrived at the Brynar Pharmaceutical Research Center, 
affiliated with Belgium's Chemistry Union, the sun suddenly 
broke through the clouds, coloring the green earth with golden 
rays. The distinguished Chinese guest brought "sunshine" to 
Belgian enterprises, punned Mr. (Jacob), president of the 
Belgian Federation of Enterprises and concurrently executive 
chairman of the League of Chemistry, who had been waiting for Li 
Ruihuan by the research center's gate. 
  No sooner had Li Ruihuan stepped out of the car, than Mr. 
Jacob told him about the Chemistry Union. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Jacob, who has been reputed as the "boss of the bosses" 
of Belgian enterprises, was very good at marketing. According 
to him, the medicine for cranial nerve system, developed by the 
center in cooperation with China, has been selling briskly. 
Therefore, he hoped to expand the cooperation and jointly 
manufacture allergy medicine. He said: The world market's 
demand for these two medicines is growing, and the prospect for 
development is bright. 
  With a sense of humor, Li Ruihuan said: "I am one of the 
`consumers' taking your medicine. The medicine for treating 
cranial nerve ailment [zhi liao nao shen jing ji bing di yao wu 
3112 4070 5207 4377 4842 4014 4016 4104 5522 3670], developed by 
your center in cooperation with China, sells well in China," 
adding that China has adopted a positive attitude toward 
importing advanced production technology from abroad as such 
technology is good for the Chinese people's health. Citing the 
successful example of "Shike [name as received]" company, a 
Sino-U.S. joint venture for manufacturing anthelmintic and cold 
medicines, Li Ruihuan urged Belgian enterprises to develop new 
medicines which can cure ailments without side effects. 
  Accompanied by Jacob and other union executives, Li Ruihuan 
viewed the center's production assembly lines for pharmaceutical 
products, showing great interest in the advanced production and 
packing technology. He said: China has a long history of 
producing traditional Chinese medicine for counter-sale, but 
still lags far behind Western nations in the production of 
Western medicine. He hoped that Belgian pharmaceutical 
enterprises would cooperate with China in not only technology 
exportation but also joint development of new medicines.

  [Text] Brussels, 20 May (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference who is visiting here, drove to visit 
Belgium's northern port city Antwerp on 20 May. 
  Antwerp Mayor (Kors) welcomed Chairman Li Ruihuan and made 
an 
ebullient and friendly speech at a ceremony in the City Hall. 
(Kors) said: Antwerp is a small city with a population of less 
than 500,000, but it maintains good, cooperative relations with 
the "largest country" in the world. It received such 
distinguished Chinese guests as former President Li Xiannian and 
President Jiang Zemin. Now it is a great pleasure for the 
government and the people of Antwerp city to have the 
opportunity to receive Chairman Li Ruihuan. 
  (Kors) said: Since Antwerp established a friendly-city 
relationship with Shanghai in 1984, the two sides have increased 
exchanges and enhanced cooperation in the economic, trade, 
scientific, technological and cultural fields day by day. To 
date, almost all big companies and enterprises in Antwerp have 
set up branches or offices in Shanghai or other Chinese cities. 
Among them, the Bell Telephone Manufacturing Company has 
entered a very successful cooperation with Shanghai, and their 
cooperation may be called a model. (Kors) expressed the belief 
that Chairman Li's current visit will further promote the 
cooperation between the two countries in economic, trade, 
cultural and other fields. 
  Li Ruihuan said in his speech: Antwerp is a world famous, 
major port. With advanced diamond, electronics, 
telecommunications, chemical, pharmaceutical, and shipbuilding 
industries, it holds a very important position in Belgium's 
economic life. 
  Li Ruihuan was satisfied with the friendship and cooperation 
between Antwerp and Shanghai. He said: Since Antwerp 
established a friendly-city relationship with Shanghai, the two 
cities not only have constantly promoted economic cooperation 
and trade and cultural exchanges between them, but they have 
also made important contributions to promoting the political, 
economic, trade, scientific and technological, and cultural 
relations between China and Belgium. While China has entered a 
new stage of development in reform, opening up, and economic 
construction, Li Ruihuan hoped that Antwerp would fully play a 
leading role in further promoting the mutually-beneficial and 
cooperative relations between the two countries. 
  Then, Li Ruihuan, accompanied by officials of relevant 
departments of Belgium and Antwerp, visited the Bell Telephone 
Manufacturing Company and the Belgium Diamond Center, and toured 
Antwerp harbor.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Li Peng will leave for an official 
visit to Austria and Germany at the end of June, his first visit 
to Europe in more than two years. The Chinese media is expected 
to provide high profile coverage of the trip, which has yet to 
be officially announced, it being Mr Li's first visit to Germany 
as premier. Mr Li is expected to arrive in Germany on July 3 
for a six-day visit at the invitation of Chancellor Dr Helmut 
Kohl, who made an official visit to Beijing Shanghai and 
Guangzhou last November. 
  Diplomats in Beijing said the visit was part of a renewed 
emphasis by Beijing on building diplomatic, economic and trade 
ties with the European Union, which is seen as a more reliable 
and pragmatic trading partner than the United States. 
  Mr Li's trip follows that of the soon-to-be-completed visit 
of politburo standing committee member, Li Ruihuan to 
Scandinavia and the Benelux countries. Diplomats said that, 
while European governments had voiced "quiet concern" over 
China's human rights record, they had emphasised that 
differences over human rights and other political issues should 
not affect the development of economic and trade ties. "There 
now appears to be a consensus amongst the Europeans that human 
rights should not get in the way of business, and that is an 
attitude the Chinese obviously appreciate," an Asian diplomat 
said yesterday. 
  The German Government in particular has adopted a very low 
profile on human rights, and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel again 
hinted this week that such sensitive issues would not be on the 
agenda during Mr Li's visit. Continued right-wing violence 
against immigrants in Germany made it very difficult for Germany 
to pressure other countries on human rights, Mr Kinkel said this 
week. 
  However Mr Li, who is still widely known in Europe as the 
"Butcher of Beijing" is unlikely to escape the human rights 
issue altogether. During his last visit to Europe in February 
1992 Mr Li was greeted by demonstrators on virtually every leg 
of his tour and was forced to cancel a meeting with the Mayor of 
Barcelona, Pascual Maragall, because his security could not be 
guaranteed by the Spanish authorities. 
  Analysts said Mr Li could use the trip to bolster his image 
at home as an international statesman. They said the premier's 
political fortune had recovered somewhat since last year when he 
suffered a major heart attack. 
  Sources close to the State Council said while Mr Li's 
economic portfolios had theoretically been ceded to Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji in late 1992 and 1993, he had recently spoken with 
authority on financial and related matters. They said economic 
policy had shifted to recentralisation, a speciality of the 
premier's.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporters Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li </F>
Tzu-ching (7812 5261 0079): "Li Peng Issues Order Placing Whole 
Nation on Alert"--first five paragraphs is CHENG MING 
introduction] 
  [Text] Li Peng issued the following order in the name of 
the premier of the State Council: Beginning 0000 on 18 April, 
the standing committee members of the party committees of 
various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities 
throughout the whole country will work a 24-hour shift system to 
take charge of security, public order, and sudden incidents 
which occur in their localities. In addition, Li Peng ordered 
the public security units and armed police units in the 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the 
country to go on alert beginning 0000 on 18 April. 
  It was an unpleasant surprise: The whole country was on the 
alert! 
  The Armed Police must be on the alert and party and 
government units must also be on the alert. 
  The information circulated within a small circle in the 
capital. Although it was a rumor some intellectuals believed it 
to be true. Many people did not understand: It is still a long 
period of time from now to "4 June." Why must they be on alert 
ahead of time? 
  The information was as follows: 
<H5>  Li Peng Issues Nationwide Alert Order </H5>
  On 16 April, Li Peng issued an order in his name as premier 
of the State Council: Beginning 0000 on 18 April, the standing 
committee members of the party committees of various provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities throughout the whole 
country work a 24-hour shift system to take charge of the 
security, public order, and sudden incidents which occur in 
their localities. 
  Li Peng also ordered the public security units and armed 
police units in various provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities throughout the whole country to go on alert 
starting 0000 on 18 April. 
  On 16 April, Qiao Shi issued an order in his name as 
chairman 
of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, 
authorizing the standing committee members of the people's 
congresses in various provinces, autonomous regions, and 
municipalities throughout the whole country to make decisions 
according to the conditions or sudden incidents occurring in 
their localities and to issue orders to safeguard social order 
and protect the normal work and daily lives of the people. 
  At 0900 on 16 April, the State Council approved and relayed 
the order from the armed police and the Public Security 
Ministry, that beginning 1800 on 17 April, the public security 
units and armed police units in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, 
Chengdu, Chongqing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Xian, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, 
Fuzhou, Urumqi, Nanjing, Jinan, and Haikou go on alert. 
  The order issued by Li Peng on 16 April was "urgent and top 
secret." 
  When the State Council approved and relayed the order from 
the Public Security Ministry and the armed police on 16 April, 
it clearly pointed out that the alert period must last until an 
appropriate time when it can be lifted or partially lifted. 
<H5>  Possible "Sudden Incidents" Which Make the Alert Necessary </H5>
  Some intellectuals are not very interested in whether the 
rumor is true or false or else they believe it but do not take 
it seriously. What they find interesting is: What are the 
"sudden incidents" which make the alert necessary? The 
following views have been expressed: 
  "Hu Yaobang died on 15 April 1989 and, thereafter, a great 
political earthquake took place. Li Peng issued the alert order 
on 16 April. Was he afraid of a recurrence of the historic 
event?" 
  "Is this a coincidence... or the death of a certain person 
will lead to a repercussions like those in 1989? Is it because 
the senior level of the CPC is worried about Deng Xiaoping's 
health problems?" 
  "Recently, the official rhetoric that 'Deng Xiaoping is in 
good health' has repeatedly appeared in the official media. Is 
it a sign of misfortune?" 
  "Perhaps the official rhetoric is not too strange but the 
cadres and the masses are rather worried, for they are afraid 
that the situation may become unstable or change tremendously." 
  "This mental condition has been reflected in the sensitive 
monetary market--since late March, many people have rushed to 
buy gold, bought U.S. currency notes on the black market, and 
sold some shares. To conclude, the people's minds are neither 
at ease nor stable." 
  "The current situation is different from that in April and 
May 1989. However, inflation is very high and in the first 
quarter of this year it reached 24 percent on average, whereas 
in the municipalities, provinces, and autonomous regions such as 
Beijing, Guangdong, Hubei, Liaoning, Sichuan, Shanxi, and 
Xinjiang, it was between 28 and 40 percent. On 11 April, the 
State Statistics Bureau revealed some data and figures for 
internal use which showed that the State Council's promise to 
keep inflation under 15 percent in the first quarter of this 
year could not be realized. Under these circumstances, the 
people have more complaints." 
  "The shadow of 1989 cannot be removed and can be vividly 
portrayed, therefore..." 
  "The approach of several dates makes people like Li Peng 
feel 
uneasy even when eating and sleeping. These days, the 75th 
anniversary of the "May 4th Movement," the "1989 pro-democracy 
movement," and the fifth anniversary of the "4 June massacre" 
are the things that they fear and so it is not strange to see Li 
Peng hurriedly issuing the alert order in a panic. 
<H5>  Jiang and Li Regime Feels Its Own Weakness </H5>
  "The spearhead of the alert order is aimed at the healthy 
forces within the party and, on the other hand, at the 
pro-democracy forces in society. And Li Peng and his men had 
the nerve to think of this!" 
  Regardless of whether or not "sudden incidents" do occur, 
one 
thing can be certain and that is: The current Jiang and Li 
regime can feel its own weakness and it has lost confidence. 
Therefore, even if nothing happens, their hearts will almost 
jump out of their chests.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Xue Li </F>
(5641 5461) and XINHUA reporter Zhang Sutang (1728 1372 1016)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 21 May (XINHUA) -- The Central Committee 
for Comprehensive Management of Public Security [CCCMPS] held 
its 12th Plenary Session in the Great Hall of the People this 
morning to study measures for improving the comprehensive 
management of public security in rural areas in accordance with 
the guidelines of the central rural work conference. Ren 
Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and 
chairman of the CCCMPS, pointed out: Vigorously and 
conscientiously implementing the central authorities' policy, 
party committees, governments, and various departments at all 
levels have adopted many realistic and effective measures and 
done a large amount of difficult and painstaking work in 
maintaining stability. Judging from the present situation, we 
think it is possible to maintain sustained social stability so 
long as we conscientiously make unremitting efforts to handle 
the task. 
  CCCMPS Vice Chairmen Luo Gan and Cao Zhi, CCCMPS members in 
Beijing, and comrades in charge of all the relevant departments 
of the central authorities participated in the plenary session. 
CCCMPS member and concurrently CCCMPS General Office Director 
Chen Jiping [7115 0370 1627] gave a briefing on a tentative plan 
to hold a national work conference on the comprehensive 
management of public security in rural areas; comrades attending 
the plenary session expressed their views on how to successfully 
hold the conference and on the various tasks and measures to be 
proposed during the conference. 
  In his speech, Ren Jianxin stressed the importance and 
necessity of improving comprehensive management of public 
security in rural areas. He said: The situation of public 
security nationwide remains very grim since early this year. 
Party committees and governments at all levels must attach a 
high degree of importance to the issue. On the one hand, 
judicial and public security departments must step up their 
crackdown on serious criminal activities and serious economic 
crimes; on the other hand, other measures for the comprehensive 
management of public security must be conscientiously 
implemented. At present, the number of public security problems 
has greatly increased in some rural areas. The masses strongly 
complain about this. We must under no circumstances 
underestimate the impact that rural areas' public security 
problems will have on the situation nationwide. We must proceed 
from the overall situation of the work of the whole party and 
the whole nation to understand this issue. 
  Ren Jianxin emphasized that while continuing to do a good 
job in harshly dealing with serious crimes, waging a 
thoroughgoing struggle to strike severe blows at serious 
economic crimes, and making greater, more comprehensive efforts 
to improve public order in large- and medium-sized cities, it is 
necessary to launch a unified and concentrated struggle to 
improve social order in rural areas. He demanded: The party 
committees and governments at all levels should attach great 
importance to improving the social order in rural areas through 
comprehensive measures. All central departments concerned and 
all quarters concerned should take an active part in the 
struggle, vigorously support it, truly place the work on daily 
agenda, and concentrate strength on doing it well. Great efforts 
should be made to implement the system of leaders assuming full 
responsibility for improving public order through comprehensive 
measures, promote the implementation of the measures, safeguard 
social stability, and create a good social environment for 
reform, opening up, and economic development. 
  Ren Jianxin pointed out: This year is very crucial to the 
deepening of reform. In light of the characteristics of this 
year's situation, the party Central Committee has put forward 
the main points of the work of the whole party and the whole 
country. It has particularly emphasized the great importance of 
understanding correctly and handling well the relationship among 
reform, development, and stability. He called on the leading 
cadres of party and government organizations at various levels 
to immerse themselves among the masses at grass-roots units, 
understand the masses' demands, and proceed from improving the 
people's living standards and solving practical problems -- the 
problems about which the people are concerned -- to resolve 
social contradictions. 
  It is reported that the CCCMPS, after serious study, has 
decided to take effective, comprehensive measures and make great 
efforts to improve social order in rural areas. 
  According to today's meeting, the improvement of social 
order 
in rural areas needs the following efforts: 1) it is necessary 
to combat crimes with greater force, ensure the implementation 
of various measures at grass-roots units to impose severe 
punishment on serious criminals following swift trials according 
to law, and deal harsh blows against those who commit serious 
crimes in rural areas; 2) people who commit minor crimes in 
disrupting public order should have their bad behavior corrected 
by listening to lectures on the legal system; 3) it is necessary 
to rectify any paralyzed or semi- paralyzed village party 
branches, villagers' committees, and mass preventive 
organizations, strengthen the force for improving public 
security through comprehensive measures in townships and towns, 
implement the system of leaders assuming full responsibility for 
maintaining law and order, truly "have someone in charge of the 
work of maintaining law and order," and ensure peace and 
stability in the area; and 4) it is necessary to manage villages 
according to law and correct the unhealthy social climate of 
"bad people always getting away with bullying good people." We 
must strive to improve remarkably the social order in rural 
areas within a fairly short period of time.

  [Text] Beijing, May 22 (AFP) -- Public order in China has 
gravely deteriorated this year and urgent steps are required to 
prevent serious unrest, a senior communist party official was 
quoted as saying Sunday. In a markedly frank assessment of 
current trends threatening social stability across the country, 
the director of the party's Central Committee for Comprehensive 
Management of Public Security, Ren Jianxin, said particular 
attention needed to be paid to signs of unrest in the 
countryside. 
  "Since the beginning of the year, the public order situation 
throughout China has become extremely grim," Ren said in a 
speech carried on the front page of the official People's Daily 
[RENMIN RIBAO]. He especially warned of mass discontent in many 
rural areas where incomes have failed to keep pace with 
inflation and where resentment is growing over regional 
disparities in living standards. "We must never underestimate 
the effect that problems of public disorder in the countryside 
will have on the country as a whole," Ren said, calling on 
governments and judicial departments at all levels to take 
immediate steps to ensure social stability. "Common law 
criminals must be punished swiftly and more heavily," he said, 
while education regarding state laws and regulations should be 
strenghened for minor offenders. In a clear indication that the 
party has effectively lost control of the situation in some 
rural areas, Ren said major efforts must be made to resurrect 
and strengthen "paralysed or semi-paralysed local party 
orgainsations and rural commitees." 
  The remarks followed a series of warnings by top government 
and party leaders that the traditional pillars of social 
stability in China are cracking as the country makes the 
transition to a market economy. Senior party leaders warned 
last week that corruption and apathy among officials were 
exacerbating the destabilising effects of unemployment, poverty 
and inflation, while President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng 
have both made speeches stressing the paramount importance of 
ensuring social stability by all means necessary. The stability 
theme has been hammered home at every opportunity in the run up 
to the fifth anniversary on June 4 of the crushing of the 1989 
pro-democracy movement, reflecting official fears of social 
unrest among groups disenfranchised by economic reform.

  [Excerpt] On the afternoon of 26 April, colorful flags 
fluttered over the Jiashan Shopping Center, which won the 
glorious national title of 100-strong market for 1993. Inside, 
the atmosphere was warm. Inspecting the shopping center, Zhu 
Rongji, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State 
Council, praised it saying it was beautifully built. 
  The Jiashan Shopping Center is situated in a location where 
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai meet. Being close to the 
Shanghai-Hangzhou railway and National Highway 320, it has 
become an important commodity distributing center in northern 
Zhejiang. The shopping center cost 15.93 million to build.

volunteers' spirit of unity, fraternity, helping others, moral 
courage, and selfless dedication and foster patriotic, 
collective, and socialist ideas and ethics. 
  He said it is hoped that the party and society as a whole

  [Text] The fourth safe production week campaign will be 
launched across the country from 15-22 May. Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua called on leading cadres at various levels to set an 
example in treating it as an important task, so the safe 
production week campaign will be unfolded truly in an organized, 
well-guided, and down-to-earth way. 
  Zou Jiahua said: Since liberation, particularly during the 
more than 10 years since the start of reform and opening up, 
China has made great achievements in economic construction and 
rapid progress in ensuring safe production. However, the 
situation of safety in production remains grim and bad accidents 
have occurred frequently over the last two years. Those 
accidents have caused great losses to the people's lives and 
property. They have also hurt our country's reputation. For 
this reason, we must not treat the production safety issue 
lightly, and must pay great attention to it at all times. All 
enterprises should regard production safety as very urgent work 
and do it well. 
  Zou Jiahua emphasized: In launching the safe production week 
campaign, we must stress actual results and prevent formalism.

  [Text] Beijing, 20 May (XINHUA) -- China is preparing to 
take a series of measures to improve protection for intellectual 
property rights in the near future. First of all, China will 
improve the legislation for intellectual property rights as well 
as a legal system for the protection of intellectual property 
rights, said Justice Minister Xiao Yang here today. 
  Xiao Yang made the remarks when he addressed the opening 
ceremony of an international symposium on intellectual property 
rights held in Beijing. The symposium was sponsored by the 
China Intellectual Property Rights Research Society, the China 
Copyright Research Society, and the Zhongcheng Intellectual 
Property Rights Protection Service Co. Ltd. National People's 
Congress Vice Chairman Cheng Siyuan, Supreme People's Court 
President Ren Jianxin, and others attended the meeting. Over 
130 people, including relevant experts, scholars, lawyers, and 
representatives of prestigious companies from China, Australia, 
Britain, France, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, 
the United States, and Hong Kong and Taiwan regions, attended 
the symposium. European and German patent bureaus, the UN 
Development Program, and some foreign embassies in China also 
sent their representatives to participate. 
  Xiao Yang said: China is prepared to formulate laws and 
provisions on punishment for infringement of copyright to more 
effectively punish and put an end to violations of intellectual 
property rights. To comply with the relevant provisions 
contained in the "Paris Convention on Protection of Industrial 
Intellectual Property" and in the "Berne Convention on 
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works" to which China has 
acceded, and to improve the protection of intellectual property 
rights related to foreign economic relations, foreign 
technology, and foreign trade, China will pay close attention to 
formulating laws and regulations on border control over products 
that infringe on intellectual property rights, and will improve 
the customs' functions of protecting intellectual property 
rights and of stopping the entrance and exit of products that 
infringe on intellectual property rights. 
  He said: With regard to the improvement of law enforcement, 
the focal point is to beef up the organs responsible for 
enforcing copyright law at all levels to guarantee the effective 
enforcement of copyright law. As regards some important cases 
that produce relatively great influence on the public, 
administrative organs responsible for enforcing laws on 
intellectual property rights may make joint efforts with the 
departments in charge of science and technology, the economy, 
culture, public security, and industry and commerce to 
investigate and deal with them. To effectively crack down on 
such criminal activities as infringing on intellectual property 
rights, people's courts in many areas have already established 
or are about to establish special courts for trial of 
intellectual property rights violations. Meanwhile, they are 
beefing up the organs responsible for such judicial work to 
ensure that various cases of intellectual property rights are 
justly and timely handled. As regards serious violations that 
constitute crimes, relevant personnel shall be investigated for 
their criminal responsibility to enforce law and discipline, to 
practically protect the legitimate rights and interests of 
owners of intellectual property rights, and to uphold the unity 
and dignity of our socialist laws and regulations. 
  Xiao Yang said: In addition, China will vigorously 
strengthen supervision over and inspection of the enforcement of 
laws on intellectual property rights. The state will organize 
relevant departments to conduct joint, general inspection of the 
enforcement of laws on intellectual property rights by all areas 
and departments at irregular intervals, to focus attention on 
investigating some important cases of intellectual property 
rights infringement that produce influence on the public, and to 
supervise the solution of such problems as lax law enforcement 
or ineffective punishment for infringement of intellectual 
property rights that exist in some areas. 
  Xiao Yang said: While taking the measures mentioned above, 
China will draw support from nongovernment sectors to improve 
its system of protection for intellectual property rights. 
Various professional associations in the spheres of science and 
technology, the economy, and culture; social groups specializing 
in intellectual property rights; and organizations offering 
socialized services constitute an important force for promoting 
the enforcement of laws on intellectual property rights and for 
improving the work of intellectual property rights protection. 
The state will encourage and support the development of these 
organizations, and guide them to take advantage of their own 
flexible mechanisms to conduct various intellectual property 
rights-related legal consultations and services, and to match 
their efforts to the needs of the society. The state will set up 
a number of organs that provide intellectual property 
rights-related legal services to assist litigants in conducting 
investigation of intellectual property rights violations, in 
collecting evidence, and in handling disputes over such 
violations through legal channels. 
  Xiao Yang said: China attaches great importance to the 
work of protecting intellectual property rights, and is stepping 
up efforts to enact laws in this regard. In recent years we 
have adopted a series of laws on trademarks, patents, technical 
contracts, copyright, and unfair competition, as well as related 
rules for the implementation of such laws, and formulated the 
"Regulations on Protecting Computer Software" and "Provisions 
for Implementing the International Copyright Treaty." Last 2 
July, the Second Meeting of the Eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC] Standing Committee adopted a "Decision of the NPC 
Standing Committee on Punishing Offenses in Producing and 
Marketing Shoddy Goods" to supplement certain provisions in 
China's "Criminal Law." The facts show that Chinese legislation 
on intellectual property protection has been improved with each 
passing day. In addition, China has acceded to a number of 
international conventions on intellectual property protection. 
China's efforts to establish an intellectual property system 
and to adapt it to the international trend show that Chinese 
protection of intellectual property rights has initially 
converged with world standards. Moreover, law enforcement, on 
the whole, is good. 
  Meanwhile, the minister pointed out: As the system of 
intellectual property protection was established in China not 
long ago, people's awareness of intellectual property is 
relatively weak. Due to the lack of sufficient understanding of 
the importance of rights protection, rights violations have 
occurred from time to time in some localities and departments. 
This has not only damaged the lawful rights and interests of 
intellectual property holders but also undermined the authority 
of the laws. 
  He said: Intellectual property protection is an important 
part of China's policy of reform and opening up to the outside 
world, as well as the socialist legal system. To establish a 
legal system for protecting intellectual property rights is 
crucial for promoting the thriving of science, technology, and 
cultural undertakings, and for ensuring normal operation of the 
socialist market economy. China will continue to make 
unremitting efforts in this regard.

a forum on correcting the irregularity of spending public funds 
on sightseeing tours abroad. Xu Qing, deputy secretary of the 
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and director of the 
State Council Office for Checking Unhealthy Tendencies in 
Business Activities, pointed out: The work of correcting the 
irregularity of spending public funds on sightseeing tours 
abroad has a good momentum, but the task remains very arduous. 
All localities and departments should take a further step to 
formulate measures, improve and strictly enforce rules and 
regulations, perpetuate the correction results, prevent a 
comeback, and strive for remarkable new interim achievements 
this year. 
  State Councillor Li Guixian and Hou Zongbin, deputy 
secretary 
of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, attended 
the forum and expressed their views on the matter. Others 
present at the meeting included Li Shizhong, State Council 
deputy secretary-general; Xia Daosheng, State Council Foreign 
Affairs Office deputy director; and responsible persons of the 
Foreign Ministry, the Public Security Ministry, and nine other 
departments which have the authority to approve overseas travel 
requests, as well as the responsible persons of the departments 
of which more personnel are involved in overseas travel on 
official business. 
  Xu Qing said in his speech: Generally speaking, all 
localities and departments, attaching importance to this matter, 
have worked in accordance with the central authorities' 
instructions and seriously reexamined those overseas travels 
which were actually sightseeing trips in disguised form made by 
officials at government expense since 1 July 1992. Some 
provinces and municipalities have sternly dealt with problems 
discovered through the reexamination. At the same time, they 
have stopped and canceled a number of unnecessary overseas 
official business study tours and training activities. However, 
the progress of the work is uneven. Other localities and 
departments are not as serious and meticulous in reexamining 
overseas travels, nor are they sternly dealing with discovered 
problems. In some organizations and localities, the practice of 
making overseas sightseeing trips in disguised form at 
government expense remains unchanged. Some localities and 
organizations are still organizing government-funded 
inter-regional or inter-departmental overseas sightseeing tours. 
  Xu Qing put forward a three-point view on this year's work: 
  -- It is necessary to continue doing a good job in screening 
the overseas travels which were actually sightseeing trips in 
disguised form made by officials at government expense since 1 
July 1992, and to stop the unhealthy tendency of making such 
trips. No locality nor department is permitted to organize 
government-funded overseas sightseeing tours under any pretext. 
Anyone who makes an overseas sightseeing trip in disguised form 
at government expense should be required to pay the "three 
expenses [san fei 0005 6316]" and be dealt with seriously. To 
deal with the travel regulations violators, we must not merely 
warn them not to repeat the violation. 
  -- To stop the unauthorized overseas sightseeing trips, we 
should take both stopgap and radical measures this year. The 
stress of the work should be put on stopping unhealthy 
tendencies, enforcing discipline, and preventing a comeback. 
First, we should get at the root of the problem. In 
particular, the central government organs should proceed from 
strictly formulating official business overseas travel plan and 
examine official travel requests in a responsible way. Second, 
we should closely watch the applications for travel to popular 
destinations and resolutely reduce excessive overseas travels. 
Third, we should stop any government-funded overseas travels 
processed through the tourism department and improve the control 
of overseas training activities by the proper departments. 
Fourth, it is necessary to improve rules and regulations and the 
procedures for examining and approving overseas travel 
applications. 
  -- It is necessary to step up supervision and inspection, 
and 
to accept the supervision by the masses. Any organizations or 
individuals who violate the travel regulations should be placed 
on file for investigation and sternly dealt with. 
  The responsible persons of the State Science and Technology 
Commission, the National Tourism Administration, and the State 
Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs delivered reports at the 
meeting on their efforts to correct the irregularity of overseas 
sightseeing tours at government expense.

<F P=106> [First of a series of reports entitled "Sights and Sounds of </F>
Chinese Prisons" by staff correspondent Tao Guangxiong (3221 
0342 7160): "Merciless Punishment, Merciful Reformation"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- Chinese 
criminal reformation is chiefly aimed at turning criminals into 
new, law-abiding, and self-supporting persons and making people 
who gave gone astray repent and reform, said Zhang Xiufu, vice 
minister of justice, in a recent interview with this reporter, 
adding that its criminal reformation is unique and highly 
effective compared with that in other countries. 
  This point is borne out by relevant statistics. In China, 
the number of prison inmates receiving reduced sentences is 
20-25 percent a year, 95 percent of ex-convicts are reformed, 
less than 10 percent of convicts are "second timers," and only 6 
to 8 percent of those offended again within three years of being 
released from prison. China has one of the lowest rates of 
recidivism in the world. 
  "Prisoners are humans too; most prisoners can be reformed." 
This saying by Mao Zedong serves as the foundation of Chinese 
criminal reformation. In recent visits to prisons in Shanghai, 
Shandong, and other places, this reporter saw that another 
saying by Mao Zedong had been hung in each prison: "Our prisons 
are not the usual prisons of past eras. Ours are actually 
schools, factories, or farms." 
  This is also the reality. Statistical work by the Ministry 
of Justice shows that each year 150,000 people serving custodial 
sentences are awarded grammar school course or study graduation 
certificates by educational departments and 100,000 various 
technical course certificates by labor departments. 
  Zhang Xiufu said: There are many methods for reforming 
criminals in China, the most notable of which is labor. People 
commit crimes for varied reasons, but mainly because of sloth, 
aversion to work, and coveting wealth. Through labor, prisoners 
can be corrected of their bad habits and made to realize that 
you have to "work hard to earn everything you own or consume." 
Collective labor can also heighten the sense of cooperation 
among prisoners, strengthen their physique, and maintain their 
physical and mental health. The acquisition of a skill or 
knowledge of production also helps prisoners find jobs and make 
a living and prevents them from returning to crime. 
  China also gives consideration to political education in 
reforming criminals, which has been attacked by some Western 
countries as "brain washing." Zhang Xiufu said: Discounting 
those who say this with malicious intent, most have no idea 
about the real situation. There was indeed something wrong with 
China's political education in the past, but "leftist" elements 
have been weeded out, and what remains now is education in 
morality, ideals, and the legal system. "Ultimately people need 
something spiritual." Political education in reformation work 
benefits criminals a great deal. 
  Behind every criminal are their parents, spouses, or 
children 
who have sincere expectations of them. Wang Fei, a former 
reform- through-labor bureau chief in Shanghai and vice chairman 
of the Chinese Society of Reform-Through-Labor Law, said in an 
interview with this reporter that Chinese criminal reformation 
has two objectives: To work for the country's stability and 
social development and the future of criminals and their 
familial happiness. The former is the essence, but the latter 
cannot be ignored. 
  "Punishment is merciless but reformation merciful," said 
Wang 
Mingdi, reform-through-labor bureau chief of the Ministry of 
Justice. Chinese prisons are the most humane. They are like 
hospitals and want prisoners to return to society as healthy and 
normal individuals. All work is done with an eye on the 
prisoners' futures upon being released from prison. The 
humanist light of Chinese criminal reformation work can be seen 
from the last emperor, Pu Yi. Many criminals have obtained a 
new lease of life through it.

<F P=106> [Second in series of reports entitled: "Sights and Sounds </F>
of Chinese Prisons" by staff reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 
7160): "Largest Prison in Far East -- Past and Present"] 
  [Text] Shanghai 21 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- At No. 147 
Changyang Road, in Shanghai, the strong fortifications, and 
solemn, severe atmosphere are quite out of place with the busy, 
bustling, and boisterous life around it; for there is an 
"arsenal" inside this metropolis -- a prison holding some 3,500 
hardened robbers, killers, rapists, embezzlers... 
  When one walks through the three iron gates, one finds that 
the active atmosphere inside the prison does not coincide with 
high walls, electric barbed-wire network, dark and worn prison 
cells: To the accompaniment of roaring motors, prisoners are 
found sewing, processing shirts; on the basketball court, 
prisoners in gray prison uniforms dash to and fro, contending 
for the ball; now and then, we see squads of prisoners moving 
along in formation. 
  This is the Shanghai Municipal Prison, and its popular name 
has been "The Tilanqiao [the Basket Bridge 2251 4691 2890] 
Prison," which was first built in 1901. This offspring of 
colonialist rule over China was said in those days to be "the 
largest prison in the Far East." Over the years, it has come 
under the jurisdiction of Britain, Japan, the Wang Ching-wei 
Collaborationist Government, and the Kuomintang Government. In 
these prison cells were held such well-known figures as Zhang 
Tai-yan, Zou Yong, Ren Bishi, and Zhang Aiping. 
  One finds such questions as "Who are you? What is this 
place? What are you doing here?" written everywhere on the 
prison walls. According to Warden Mai Linhua's briefings, most 
of the inmates held here are felons, serving prison sentences of 
10 years or more. They are put in different cells, and they 
undergo different kinds of education and transformation 
according to their different inclinations, based on whether 
their offenses involve property, sex or violence. The inmates 
work eight hours each day; in the evening, they take part in 
cultural or technical studies. 
  This reporter visits the rubber cell, the "pavilion for 
trouble- makers," and the "indoor execution ground," which were 
set up in the old days. They remind him of a commentary carried 
in "DONGFANG ZAZHI" [Oriental Journal], which was published in 
those years. The commentary read: "The maltreatment of inmates 
in the prison run by Westerners in Shanghai is the talk of the 
town. In recent years, cases of inmates' dying in prison have 
been numerous, and Chinese residents turn pale, even at the 
mention of the prison." 
  Today, the inmates here manage their own affairs to a great 
extent. A committee for activists in transformation through 
labor is set up in every unit which is responsible for the 
inmates' study, food, and labor, and for safeguarding prison 
rules, regulations, and discipline. The committee is re-elected 
every year, and those found ineligible are removed. An 
assessment of each inmate is conducted at the end of each 
quarter, and is treated differently according to his/her 
behavior. In 1993, 966 inmates were granted commutation of 
sentence or parole. 
  On each floor of cells, this reporter finds a "letterbox for 
procuratorial personnel," as well as a "letterbox for the 
Warden." This reporter is told that inmates may conduct 
accusations or appeals via the first letterbox so as to protect 
their own legitimate rights and interests. This letterbox can 
be opened only by the cadre from the procuratorial organization 
who is stationed in the prison. Through the second letterbox, 
inmates may offer opinions and suggestions on prison management 
and labor transformation. 
  Each inmate spends 62 yuan on meals every month. Those who 
overfulfill their production quotas are given bonuses. In 
recent years, the Shanghai Municipal Prison has prepared its 
cafeteria in a scientific way, based on the general diseases 
surfacing among the inmates during their imprisonment. The 
cafeteria categorizes its meals into the following categories: 
regular, nutritious, elderly, minority nationality, medical 
treatment through diet, and birthday celebration. The prison 
authorities conduct scientific analysis of the menu each week, 
and in the following week, they improve certain dishes found to 
be less nourishing. 
  Cultural and sports activities behind the iron bars are rich 
and colorful. There is a radio station, a television station, 
and a transformation-through-labor paper, in addition to a 
poetry society, a fashion-show team, and an artistic performance 
troupe. A large sports meet is held every three years, a 
theatrical festival every two years, and a fine arts exhibition 
each year. Bridge tournaments and flower and book exhibitions 
are held often. 
  Owing to limited conditions, this classic prison has not 
gone 
through any significant transformation or expansion, and the 3.3 
square meters floor space of each cell in the British design 
remains intact. To meet the needs of the situation, Shanghai 
Municipality has built a high-standard prison in suburban 
Qingpu. Qingpu Prison is one of the most modern prisons in 
China today, and will become a showcase for China in the 
transformation of criminals.

<F P=106> [Article by Wei Jingsheng (7614 0079 3932) dated 30 November </F>
1993: "China and the World" -- originally published in OU CHOU 
JIH PAO; first three paragraphs are editor's note] 
  [Text] It was rumored that Wei Jingsheng, who was detained 
by the mainland authorities on 1 April this year, would be 
prosecuted and tried once again. Although Beijing has denied 
the rumor, Wei Jingsheng's fate in the days to come worries the 
outside world to a certain extent. 
  At the beginning of this year, a female French Sinologist, a 
friend of Wei Jingsheng, brought the two articles which Wei 
Jingsheng wrote at the end of last year to France. At that 
time, Wei told her that he hoped to see the two articles 
published in Europe. Being devoted to the trust conferred on 
her, his friend wrote and published articles in CROISSANCE and 
LIBERATION, introducing the contents of the two articles. The 
Chinese versions of the two articles were handed to OU CHOU JIH 
PAO [EUROPE DAILY], a subsidiary of LIEN HO PAO, for exclusive 
publication. This newspaper reprints them today. Wei Jingsheng 
entitled his articles "China and the World" and "How to Invest 
in China." Today we reprint the article: "China and the World." 
  In his article "China and the World," Wei Jingsheng appealed 
to European and American countries to support the democracy 
movement and the reform process in mainland China for the sake 
of long-term interest. He maintained that the issue of the fate 
and future of the Chinese people is a major issue which has a 
bearing on the future of mankind and it is much more important 
than selling a nuclear power station. 
  It is common knowledge that China is equal to one-fourth of 
mankind. It is the only great classic civilization that has 
lasted up to this day, and so far is the largest country that 
has been under one-party rule by the Communist Party. 
Nevertheless, what kind of country is China, in reality? What 
kind of people are the Chinese? What kind of relationship do 
they share with the other parts of the world? These are things 
on which no one is very clear. This being the case, it is both a 
logical and extremely dangerous state of affairs that importance 
has not yet been attached to China's affairs and to its 
influence on the future world. 
<H5>  China Does Not Necessarily Lack Any Tradition of Legality </H5>
  China has age-old cultural traditions that differ from 
European culture. China's culture is unique, and has been very 
successful over the past 5,000 years. Apparently, it will 
retain the majority of its fine substance in the years to come, 
and on that basis, a new cultural system will be formed. Some 
Chinese and Europeans maintain that, like many other backward or 
weak nations, China can accept European culture totally and 
uncritically, and can develop its modern civilization with 
European culture as the mainstay. This is obviously wrong. The 
reason this is wrong is not that China is incompatible with 
modern European civilization. Quite the contrary, the Chinese 
were the fastest in accepting the European culture among all 
nations besides the Europeans; they were even faster than some 
European nations. 
  More often than not, Westerners who know the Chinese are 
amazed at the speed and the degree of understanding with which 
the Chinese (not referring exclusively to the Chinese of today) 
accept Western cultures, as well as science and technology. The 
fact that Western science and technology -- and cultures, in 
particular, those forerunners of democratic and liberal ideas -- 
and Chinese traditional culture have close links shows that 
Chinese and Western civilizations are not incompatible. 
Otherwise, we would be unable to explain why Copernicus, 
Leibniz, Voltaire, Montesquieu, Rousseau, and others were very 
familiar with, and even had the greatest esteem for Chinese 
culture. Although Europe's modern democratic legal system 
differs in essence from China's classic autocratic legal system, 
Montesquieu charted the blueprint for Europe's modern legal 
system by using China's classic forms of legal system as direct 
reference. Therefore, the allegation by the Communists, and of 
the royalists of the older generation before them, that the 
Chinese lack a tradition of legality is sheer nonsense. 
<H5>  The CPC Does Not Tolerate the Existence of a Normal Legal </H5>
System 
  In fact, when it comes to some of the basic ideas of the 
modern legal system, such as "Everyone being equal before the 
law," the Europeans were not the first to discover them; 
instead, they were translated directly by the forerunners of 
democracy -- including Montesquieu -- from China's legal system 
culture. The principle that "if a prince violates the law, he 
will be punished just like ordinary people" has existed in 
Chinese legal clauses for at least 2,000 years. Although these 
modern principles and ideas of legality were not accurately 
guaranteed in the classical autocratic legal system, and were 
violated frequently by members of the ruling groups, which had 
unrestricted supreme power in their hands, they really served as 
the basis on which honest law-enforcement personnel protected 
the people's rights and interests, thus playing a genuine role 
-- to a certain extent -- in protecting human rights and in 
maintaining social fairness and stability. The forerunners of 
democracy and the legal system in Europe have raised the status 
and role of these ideas and principles greatly, and have 
developed a completely new democratic legal system, thus 
enabling these basic ideas and principles to play a greater role 
in protecting human rights and maintaining stability. Thus, the 
argument asserting that the Chinese -- who were the earliest to 
put forward these ideas and principles and who had been familiar 
with them for more than 2,000 years -- were not suited to the 
ideas and principles of legality which obviously were favorable 
to them can be nothing but sheer nonsense. I can hardly find 
any other more accurate adjectives. 
  This kind of lawless situation exists in China, but it is 
not a continuity of Chinese tradition. It was borrowed by the 
Chinese communists from the non-legal tradition in ancient 
European culture. They integrated this kind of feudal and 
antilegal "communism" with "small-peasant liberalism," which was 
a branch of the traditional Chinese culture, to form the 
"Chinese-style Maoist" legal ideology. They used this ideology 
to mobilize the peasants to overthrow the legal system that had 
lasted for more than 2,000 years in China, and they built a 
contemporary lawless despotic regime characterized by 
small-peasant opportunism. This despotic regime, therefore, is 
unable to tolerate the existence of a normal legal system, no 
matter in terms of ideological principle or in terms of 
practice. So 40 years after the nation's founding, a 
preliminary legal system still is nowhere to be found, so 
naturally the country cannot be ruled by law. It resembles a 
robot, and you treat its head when its head aches, treat its 
foot when its foot hurts. There is always a specific therapy 
for every illness, but there is no fixed, predictable, and 
systematic prescription for every illness. Therefore, politics 
in China can only maintain this kind of chaotic situation, which 
is highly fortuitous, unpredictable, and adjusted by a small 
handful of persons using expedient measures. This style of 
maintenance is the most difficult one, as well as an operational 
style that places the harshest demands on leaders. Or it may be 
regarded as a style for which it is almost impossible to find a 
suitable operator to ensure its good operation, so I say that 
the CPC regime is a power structure that harbors great factors 
for turmoil. 
<H5>  Internal Power Struggle Most Likely Cause for Turmoil </H5>
  Turmoil can erupt in many areas and in different ways. The 
greatest possibility is that it will erupt from the power 
struggle within the CPC. Reason number one: Although peasant 
and worker riots are the easiest way for it to erupt, owing to 
the overwhelming difference between their own ability and the 
might of the modern machine of suppression, riots can be only 
the catalyst for intensifying social conflict and cannot be the 
main way to overthrow the government. Reason number two: The 
road through which an opposition party promotes progressive 
changes or so-called peaceful evolution to democratic system has 
been completely blocked by those in power. With the silent 
consent of governments in the West, the CPC gradually has 
tightened its control over the mass media, to the extent that 
new thoughts and ideas cannot spread. So the possibility that 
exploration into new thoughts and ideas may lead to social 
consensus diminishes, whereas the CPC does not have new thoughts 
and ideas that can win a general consensus in society. What it 
has is only the evil method of eliminating its opponents in a 
brutal and unreasonable way. Thus, Chinese society will maintain 
a blind, confused, chaotic, and antigovernment mentality for a 
long period of time. This is how things are at the moment. 
Aside from the fact that the CPC fails to offer any presentable 
and convincing theory, even if it could, it would find no major 
opponent. The CPC solves one problem only to find another 
cropping up. Apart from normal modern democratic thought, there 
are numerous strange thoughts and theories confronting the CPC's 
lack-of-thinking theory in the struggle to win hearts and minds, 
and almost all of them are very successful. To conclude, the 
most likely cause for great turmoil in China in the future is 
the struggle for power and interests within the CPC. 
<H5>  China's Influence Greater Than Is Estimated by Historians </H5>
  Over the past four decades, owing to the self-imposed 
closure 
by the CPC and the blockade by the international community, 
China was comparatively isolated from the world, so for many 
people, China has nothing much to do with the world. Many 
people even think that China's situation does not have anything 
to do with their countries and their interests; so why bother 
whether the Chinese people live or die? Although this kind of 
thinking is not quite in line with the humanitarianism and 
humanism declared by the Europeans, it is indeed a principle 
followed by many European politicians, and it also influences 
the attitude of a majority of Europeans. In fact, these 
politicians who believe in pragmatism have covered up many facts 
that already have happened and will soon happen beside you. 
  Since the middle of 19th century, when China and Europe 
began 
frequent trade interactions, every major incident that happened 
in China has had something to do with the West, and has become 
an important topic in the governments and parliaments in the 
Western countries. By the time of World War II, China already 
had become one of the major and indispensable members of the 
Western allies, and the important role it played in winning the 
antifascist war can be matched only by the two great countries: 
The United States and the Soviet Union. The trends of this 
century have indicated that the closer China's relationship with 
the rest of the world becomes, the more evident is its 
importance as the largest part of mankind. The importance of 
this nation, which Napoleon called a sleeping lion, is in direct 
proportion to the degree of its consciousness. After World War 
II, the situation was even more shocking. The establishment of 
the Maoist regime changed the political pattern of the whole 
world, and almost every foreign and domestic condition and 
policy in the Western countries was affected by this incident. 
The theory of violent revolution exported by Mao Zedong also 
became the main ideology in the world during the 1960's and 
1970's, and its influence spread to every corner of the world 
and has not yet disappeared even to this day. What is more 
important is that the Democracy Wall movement and the continuous 
development of the pro- democracy movement in China, have become 
the starting point for the tides of democracy in "socialist 
countries," and its important role in human history cannot 
possibly be adequately evaluated by contemporary historians or 
anybody else. The importance of such a country should be beyond 
dispute, and any change it goes through -- for better or for 
worse -- will have a decisive impact on the future development 
of mankind which will be hard to evaluate. 
  If some 
politicians have to satisfy the need of some businessmen, so 
they tell you that "it is unimportant," would you not feel that 
this is an extremely irresponsible deception? I think, if I 
were a French or American politician who had a responsible 
attitude toward his country and people, I would sacrifice some 
commercial sponsorships or even votes, in order to fully support 
China's democracy movement and reform process because whether 
China has a strong noncommunist democracy movement is a crucial 
and decisive factor determining whether China can embark on the 
road of cooperation between the government and the people in 
peacefully reforming the social system. Whether China follows 
the road of peaceful democratic reform or waits for a war among 
the warlords is no longer a matter that concerns the fate and 
future of the Chinese people alone; it also has a bearing on the 
immediate interests of the French and American peoples. I think 
that this is more important than whether or not they can sell 
one more nuclear power plant because the interests of the French 
and American peoples do not terminate when tenures expire. An 
old saying in China goes: One who has no long-term 
considerations has imminent worries. A person who looks down on 
long-term interests often will be plagued by present 
difficulties that he cannot overcome. 
<H5>  The West Should Help Promoting Democracy Movement </H5>
  I want to take this opportunity to tell everyone that my 
friendship with the Europeans begins with two Frenchmen. It is 
precisely from them that I have discovered that the Chinese and 
Europeans can understand and help each other easily. I hope 
this kind of friendship and understanding can break through the 
blockade by the CPC and reach out to all Europeans and Chinese. 
This way, our world certainly would be a better one!

Jun (2621 7165): "China Attracted Worldwide Attention With its 
Achievements in Intellectual Property Rights Protection" ] 
  [Text] Beijing, 20 May (XINHUA) -- In conformity with the 
principle of seeing to it that "laws already enacted are 
observed, violators are brought to justice, and laws are 
enforced to the letter," people's courts at all levels in China 
and relevant administrative organs have solemnly and impartially 
enforced law and scored achievements, which attract worldwide 
attention in protecting the legitimate rights and interests of 
Chinese and foreign holders of intellectual property rights. 
  According to statistics, people's courts at all levels from 
1986 to 1993 accepted and held first-instance hearings on 3,505 
intellectual property rights cases, including 1,783 patent 
rights cases, 1,168 copyrights cases, and 554 trademarks cases. 
  Liu Jiyang [0491 3423 2254], secretary general of the China 
Intellectual Property Rights Association, said: Because they 
have adhered to the principle of being strict and impartial when 
protecting intellectual property rights, and because they have 
drawn on the successful experiences of other countries, China's 
law- enforcement departments are getting close to international 
standards on law enforcement. 
  Before July 1993, no special judicial courts that try 
intellectual property rights cases existed among China's courts; 
such cases were tried separately by judicial courts that handle 
economic or civil affairs. Because Beijing Municipality has the 
highest occurrences of disputes over intellectual rights among 
China's cities, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court and 
the Municipal Intermediate Court finally established, 
simultaneously, judicial courts to handle intellectual property 
rights cases in July 1993. Those were the first courts of such 
nature to be established in the Chinese court system. 
  Since the beginning of this year, higher people's courts and 
some intermediate people's courts in Shanghai Municipality, 
Guangdong Province, Fujian Province, and Hainan Province 
successively established judicial courts to handle intellectual 
property rights cases. 
  According to Su Chi [1372 6688], president of the 
Intellectual Property Rights Court of the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court, his court accepted and heard all 
types of intellectual property rights cases: patent rights, 
trademarks, copyrights (including copyrights over computer 
software), technical disputes unrelated to patent rights, and 
all other cases of disputes arising from unfair competition 
brought about by failure to observe the principle of honesty and 
trust and by acts infringing on other people's business credit 
and trade secret. 
  Following its establishment, the intellectual property 
rights 
court accepted and heard 271 cases concerning all types of 
intellectual property rights, including 21 involving foreign 
nationals. The amount of money under dispute totaled 156 
million yuan renminbi. 
  Su Chi said: Our court, without exception, uses a collegiate 
bench to try intellectual property rights cases. It even 
employs experts as jurors when the collegiate bench tries cases 
that are highly technical, or which involve disputes over patent 
rights and copyrights over computer software. However, most 
cases are tried by a collegiate bench of judges. When it comes 
across technical problems, the judicial court will invite two or 
more experts to provide explains and assessments on technical 
issues. 
  He pointed out: Without exception, all cases involving 
intellectual property rights are tried in public unless 
stipulated otherwise by law. In addition to announcing in 
advance the schedule for each court session according to legal 
procedures, the Beijing Municipal Intellectual Property Rights 
Court also informs society in advance about its monthly 
schedules for court sessions and expresses the wish to see 
people from all sectors of society come and witness the court 
sessions. According to statistics, over 3,000 people came to 
the court sessions in over half a year. 
  Rights-infringement cases account for over 80 percent of all 
intellectual property rights cases tried by the Beijing 
Municipal Intellectual Property Rights Court. When handling 
lawsuits over rights-infringement disputes, the court abides by 
this principle: Once evidence proves that a case constitutes 
rights infringement, the court will act in accordance with the 
proposition of relevant rights holders and in accordance to the 
law, and will order the person who infringes rights to 
compensate relevant rights holder the total amount of losses 
suffered by him due to rights infringement. The amount of 
compensation paid will be in accordance with the criteria that 
it is sufficient enough to compensate the losses incurred on the 
rights holders and to prevent future rights- infringing acts. 
  Su Chi said: During the trial of a case involving disputes 
over trademark infringement, filed by the Beijing-Paris Damofang 
Food Company Limited against Beijing Sun City Bazaar, the 
Beijing Municipal Intellectual Property Rights Court had, for 
the first time in its court decisions, made clear that the 
rights-infringing party had to pay the rational amount of fees 
incurred on the rights- holding party during the rights-holding 
party's investigation of rights-infringing acts and when the 
party initiated legal proceedings. 
  He explained: The court made that decision because it fully 
carried out the principle of "leveling up," which is provided 
for by Chinese civil laws. This is so the person whose rights 
has been infringed upon can be compensated fully for his losses, 
and that he will have less to worry about financially when he is 
in a legal tussle with rights-infringing acts. The decision was 
also made in reference to relevant stipulations on the 
intellectual property rights agreement reached at the Uruguay 
Round. 
  Over the past 14 years, China established a complete legal 
system to deal with intellectual property rights. The National 
People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee successively 
promulgated the Trademark Law, the Patent Rights Law, the 
Copyrights Law, and the Anti-Unfair Competition Law. 
  From 1992 to 1993, the NPC Standing Committee successively 
adopted the amended Patent Rights Law and Trademark Law to 
extend patent rights protection to chemical substances, 
medicines, food, drinks, and condiments; to expand the scope of 
patent rights to include imports rights and the scope of patent 
rights over production methods to include products; and to 
extend trademark protection to service trademarks. 
  China has also participated actively in international 
cooperation in intellectual property rights, performed its 
international duty, and joined relevant international 
organizations. 
  Dr. Arpad Bogsch, director general of the World Intellectual 
Property Organization, once offered this appraisal: "In terms of 
intellectual property rights protection, the speed with which 
China accomplishes everything is unparalleled."

  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- The "World Outlook 
Book Series," compiled by Xu Weicheng, executive deputy head of 
the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, recently 
brought forth the second series. The five books in the second 
series are: "AIDS: The Plague of the 20th Century," "Shadow 
Under the Olympic Flame," "the Japanese-U.S. Trade War," 
"Europe's Powderkeg -- A History of the Balkans," and "A Look at 
the U.S. Presidential Election." 
  Xu Weicheng said he compiled this series to help readers 
gain 
a better understanding of the world. He added that this series 
strives for veracity and to expose the truth of the matter. 
  The four books in the first series, "Colorful India," "China 
and the World at the Turn of the Century," "the Rise of Hitler," 
and "Mafia: the Incurable Italian Disease," were compiled 
following the afore-mentioned principle. The first series, 
published by Sichuan People's Publishing House in the end of 
1991, were popular with the readers and sales of the first 
series has reached some 25,000 sets. A book reviewer said these 
books are of high taste and readable; they are not travelogues 
recording customs and conventions, nor are they historical 
documents or academic works; they have their own style. 
  The second series retains the strong points of the first, 
but 
places added emphasis on readability. "AIDS: The Plague of the 
20th Century" is the first book in China which, written from the 
perspective of a social scientist, systematically describes the 
ravages of AIDS. Presented through a true story, "The Shadow 
Under the Olympic Flame" tells how the spirit of the Olympics is 
faced with different challenges. Through an analysis of the 
rivalry between Japan and the United States, two economic powers 
which practice two different modes of capitalism, "The 
Japanese-U.S. Trade War" brings forth many issues that give more 
food for thought than that from the outcome of an economic 
competition. Through a retelling of the incessant wars on the 
Balkan peninsula, "Europe's Powderkeg -- A History of the 
Balkans" lets the readers look into the deeper reasons that 
produce the contradictions and conflicts. Through the many 
hubbubs that arose during Clinton's election campaign, "A Look 
at the U.S. Presidential Election" traces the origin of the 
democratic system in the West and relates some interesting 
events during U.S. presidential election campaigns. 
  It has been learned that the compilation of the third "World 
Outlook Book Series" is now in the works.

"Mainland Provinces Preparing To Build Nuclear Plants"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 18 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Since 
Zhejiang's Qinshan nuclear power station and Guangdong's Daya 
Bay nuclear power station went into operation, the Beijing 
authorities have started preparations for more nuclear plants to 
be built across the country by the end of this century and early 
next century so as to alleviate the country's energy shortage. 
It has been learned that while Zhejiang and Guangdong are 
preparing at the moment to build their second nuclear plants, 
Fujian, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Hainan, and some 
other provinces also are making preliminary preparations for 
building their own nuclear plants. Moreover, provinces like 
Jilin, Sichuan, and Heilongjiang already are conducting 
feasibility studies for nuclear energy development. It has been 
learned that as the country has only limited construction funds, 
the state's departments concerned are expected to invite 
overseas investment and foreign funds to help with the country's 
nuclear development. 
  Over the past few years, the country has witnessed rapid 
industrial and commercial development. Nonetheless, slow energy 
development and a 20-some percent shortage of electrical energy 
supply in the country has impeded the nationwide economic growth 
to some extent. In order to meet the growing demand for 
electrical energy and to guarantee a sufficient electrical 
energy supply across the country, apart from building more 
thermal power and hydropower stations, the authorities also are 
determined to speed up the country's nuclear energy development, 
as this causes less pollution. In accordance with the state 
plan, the country's electrical energy production will have 
reached 300 million kwh by the year 2000, of which nuclear 
energy production will account for some 20 million kwh. 
  It has been learned that since the two 0.9 million kwh 
generating sets installed at the Daya Bay nuclear power station 
went into operation, Guangdong has decided to build its second 
nuclear power station in Lingao, north of Daya Bay, and a third 
one in Yangjiang. Construction of the Lingao and Yangjiang 
nuclear power stations is scheduled to be completed around the 
year 2002. The two nuclear power stations are to have four and 
six generating sets, respectively. By the year 2002, 
Guangdong's three nuclear power stations are expected to have a 
combined installed capacity of 10 million kwh, thus basically 
meeting the province's demand for electrical energy. 
  In Zhejiang, a 0.3 million kwh generating set installed in 
the Qinshan nuclear power station during the first-phase 
construction, has gone into operation. Now two other 0.6 
million kwh generating sets are being installed as well. 
Second-phase construction at the Qinshan nuclear power station 
has begun. The two new generating sets are scheduled to go into 
operation in 1996. Zhejiang has also decided to build two 2 
million kwh nuclear power stations along its coastline, in 
Sanmen Bay and Leqing, respectively. They are scheduled to go 
into operation by the turn of the century. 
  Moreover, a number of provinces with conditions for nuclear 
energy development are also preparing to build nuclear plants. 
For instance, Fujian is planning to build a nuclear plant in 
Shanqian township in Huian County, at the mouth of Quanzhou Bay. 
The nuclear power station will have six 0.9-million kwh 
generating sets, with a combined installed capacity of 5.4 
million kwh when its three-phase construction is completed. The 
plant is to be installed with two generating sets when its 
first-phase construction is completed early next century. 
  In addition, Jiangxi also has decided to build a nuclear 
plant with an installed capacity of 3.6 million kwh on Maoziding 
Mountain in Guze County of Jiujiang City. Hainan Province 
currently is seeking a site on which to build a nuclear power 
station, and is conducting feasibility studies regarding the 
first-phase construction of a 0.3 million kwh generating set. 
Liaoning Province has decided to build a nuclear plant with an 
installed capacity of 1 million kwh in Wentuozi. Jiangsu, 
Shandong, and some other provinces also are conducting 
feasibility studies for building nuclear power stations, and are 
expected to build nuclear power stations one after another in 
the near future. 
  It has been learned that apart from inviting urgently 
needed funds for its nuclear development from some foreign 
countries and regions, the country still will try to raise most 
of the funds it needs for this purpose in cooperation with the 
local departments concerned. This is why the Beijing 
authorities have decided to set up a funds rotation mechanism 
for nuclear development, with an eye to guaranteeing a continued 
supply of funds for the country's nuclear development. Minister 
of Power Industry Shi Dazhen pointed out that under the proposed 
funds rotation mechanism for nuclear development, after a 
nuclear power station is built and goes into operation, the 
state will not try to collect its profits. Instead, the plant's 
profits will be used to build other nuclear power stations so 
that more such stations can be built across the country. The 
nuclear power station is allowed to divert as much as 2.3 
billion yuan of profits to other nuclear stations under 
construction so that more provinces will be able to build 
nuclear power stations. 
  Guangdong's Daya Bay nuclear power station has been 
installed 
with French advanced compressed-water reactors [ya shui shi fan 
ying dui 1090 3055 1709 0646 2019 1018]. In the future, the 
country is likely to continue purchasing French equipment for 
its nuclear plants. However, as the Shanghai-made nuclear 
reactors installed at the Qinshan nuclear power station have 
proven to be perfectly reliable and efficient, the country is 
more likely to use more domestically manufactured equipment for 
its nuclear plants. As a result, Shanghai certainly will become 
the country's nuclear equipment supply base.

  [Text] Shenzhen, May 19 (CNS) -- The "Asia No.2" satellite 
is scheduled to be launched in the first quarter next year and 
most of 33 transmitters installed in the satellite have been 
hired in advance by clients, according to a conference held by 
the Asia Satellite Limited Company in Shenzhen. 
  The regional satellite mainly for commercial communications 
in Asia will be launched by the China Great Wall Industrial 
Company in Xichang. About half of the transmitters already 
hired will be used for television broadcasting while the rest 
will be employed in communications. 
  This satellite is so far the largest commercial one with the 
greatest power in Asia while it is also the world's largest and 
most advanced communications satellite operated in a static 
orbit. The satellite will cover a wide area starting in Tokyo 
in the east, stretching to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, to 
the Commonwealth of Independent States in the north and to New 
Zealand in the south. The total population is put at 3.3 billion 
in the region covered by the satellite, making up 63 percent of 
the world population. It is expected that life expectancy for 
the satellite is as long as 15 years. 
  The Asia Satellite Limited Company has begun preparatory 
work 
for the launching of the "Asia No. 3" satellite.

  [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- China has reported new 
progress in genetic studies in such fields as anthel culture 
breeding and microbial genetics, with some of the results being 
applied in economic development. 
  To accelerate genetic study, Chinese scientists have 
conducted extensive research in cell genetics, plant transfer of 
foreign genes and the development of species resources, 
molecular genetics and molecular biochemical mark. 
  In plant genetics, the "Jinghua No. 1" developed by Beijing 
Plant Engineering Laboratory, has been hailed by Chinese and 
foreign scientists as the world's first anthel breeding of 
winter wheat. The new seed has been proved successful in 540,000 
hectares of wheat. 
  Up to now, about ten wheat varieties and 22 rice varieties 
developed with anthel culture have been used in crops covering 
up to two million hectares, which helped boost China's 
agricultural production. 
  The allo hexaploit secale cereal is another new result from 
the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences which raised per 
hectare cereal output by 40 to 60 percent above other 
conventional seeds. The product has been proved highly effective 
in cattle feeding with excellent quality in milk production. 
  A new soybean seed developed by the Institute of Genetics 
Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences by applying chemical 
mutagenesis technology has been used in over 200,000 hectares of 
crops since 1990, adding 100 million yuan (11 million U.S. 
dollars) in economic returns. 
  Meanwhile, new advances have also been scored in 
bio-organisms and medical genetics of human beings. Scientists 
in the Chinese Academy of Medical Science have developed a 
unique way to detect antenatal genes by comparing two genes with 
hereditary diseases. The new way, which is applicable in 
different regions across China, has proved to be an easy, fast 
and accurate way to analyse antenatal genes. 
  The mutagenesis resistant effect of Chinese medicine is also 
a topic of research in Beijing University and Beijing University 
of Chinese Medicine. Their results are expected to be 
revolutionary in the development of Chinese medicine and disease 
prevention if remarkable progress has been scored, experts said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- All members of the 
Communist Party of China (CPC) have been urged to study modern 
science and technology alongside the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics put forward by Deng 
Xiaoping and general knowledge on building a socialist market 
economy. 
  In today's world, the general office of the CPC Central 
Committee says in a circular publicized today, technology is 
developing rapidly and international competition in this field 
is growing ever more fierce. 
  "Under such circumstances," the circular says, "we will find 
ourselves in a passive condition if we hesitate to arm our party 
members and cadres with modern science and technology or improve 
the scientific and cultural level of the Chinese nation." 
  In studies, the circular says, special attention should be 
paid to the thesis "economic construction should rely on science 
and technology and scientific and technological work should 
serve economic construction" promulgated by Deng Xiaoping so as 
to shift the focus of economic construction and social 
development to technological advances and the improvement of the 
skills of workers.

  [Text] China has allocated more funds for research on 
natural sciences in a bid to encourage projects that have less 
obvious commercial applications. 
  Professor Sun Shu, vice-president of the National Natural 
Science Foundation of China, said the foundation had received an 
average annual increase of 20 to 30 per cent of its budget since 
1992. 
  This year, the foundation will receive about 366 million 
yuan 
(HK$326.5 million) from the Government, which will increase by 
about 19 per cent to 430 million yuan next year, Professor Sun 
said. The foundation is China's major research institution for 
the natural sciences. 
  Lack of funding has long been a problem for China's 
educational and research organisations, resulting in a serious 
brain drain and a large proportion of the population remaining 
illiterate. 
  Every year, Beijing allocates about 0.7 per cent of its 
gross 
national product on scientific research while across the Taiwan 
Strait, Taipei allocates 1.7 per cent of its GDP on science. 
[sentence as published] 
  Professor Sun, who is also a geology lecturer at the 
prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "As a scientist, 
I would say that not enough money has been injected into the 
research and development of science and technology." 
  But the scholar was quick to add that the Chinese Government 
had done its best for a developing country. 
  Qian Haoqing, division chief of the foundation's planning 
bureau, said the Government had adopted a policy of supporting 
commercial research only if it was economically viable, while 
continuing to fund the less-commercial natural sciences. 
  Professor Sun said there were a series of measures to 
encourage and groom young scientists to work in industry.

Institute, Southwest Rolling Stock Plant, Construction Machine 
Tool Plant, and Chongqing Shipyard. He fully affirmed the 
achievements made by factories and scientific research 
institutes in relying on their technological superiority to open 
up civilian goods market. He said: The military industry in 
Sichuan, having a tremendous strength and playing a very 
important role, has made great contributions to China's national 
defense construction. Some military industry enterprises have 
found, through exploration, effective ways to turn themselves 
into producers of goods for civilian use. 
  Liu Huaqing said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping, with great 
strategic insight, proposed the conversion of military industry 
enterprises into producers of civilian goods some 10 years ago. 
With his guidance, China's military industry enterprises have 
achieved a strategic shift and made great success. At present, 
military industry enterprises should seize the opportunity to 
further readjust their structure, take the initiative in 
entering the market, and adapt themselves to the new situation 
in which we are establishing a socialist market economic 
structure. During the conversion, the enterprises must take 
full advantage of their superiority and use high and new 
technology to produce pillar products. It is necessary to carry 
forward the military industry's tradition of "putting quality 
above everything else." At the same time, it is necessary to 
try in every possible way to reduce costs, enhance competitive 
power, and constantly update products according to market demand. 
  Liu Huaqing was greatly concerned about the work and 
livelihood of scientists, technicians, and enterprise workers. 
Wherever he went, he familiarized himself with their income and 
living conditions. He said: Military industry enterprises and 
institutions have a very good work force. Quietly immersing 
themselves in hard work and dedication, they have displayed the 
fine quality of the working class and contributed to the 
national defense construction and economic development. Now, it 
is necessary to stabilize the work force and carry out reforms 
to develop production, enhance economic efficiency, and further 
improve the production and living conditions. 
  Liu Huaqing pointed out: Sichuan has very good natural 
conditions and a great potential. Located on the major route of 
the Red Army's Long March, it is an important strategic place to 
which Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and other proletarian 
revolutionaries of the older generation have paid great 
attention. Leading comrades at all levels must fully attach 
importance to agriculture, which is the foundation of economy, 
and arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for production. It is 
necessary to pay attention to the difficulties confronting large 
and medium state-owned enterprises and use our heads to overcome 
them. Liu Huaqing emphasized: Since the masses are greatly 
concerned about such issues as the promotion of ethical 
integrity and the improvement of public order, we should take 
action to deal with those issues at the grass-roots level. On 
some economic difficulties and problems at present, Liu Huaqing 
said: We should work in accordance the central authorities' 
unified plan and subordinate ourselves to the interest of the 
whole. Under the conditions of market economy, we should 
display the pioneering spirit of hard struggle, diligence, and 
frugality and work as one to overcome difficulties. 
  Accompanied by Chengdu Military Region commander Li Jiulong 
and Sichuan party Secretary Xie Shijie, Liu Huaqing visited the 
officers and men of the People's Liberation Army units and the 
armed police units in Sichuan during his inspection. He called 
on those units to pay attention to the quality of troops and 
urged them to actively support local economic construction.

  [Text] The People's Liberation Army [PLA] Information 
Engineering Institute [xin xi gong cheng xue yuan] has developed 
a new, large-capacity, program-controlled digital telephone 
exchange system [dian hua cheng kong shu zi jiao huan xi tong], 
which is up to the highest standards in the world. It has been 
put to use in the telecommunications network over the last year 
or so, and has proven to be advanced in design and safe and 
reliable in operation. It is the product of a new industry. 
According to the appraisal by a relevant department, it is an 
important milestone in the development of China's 
telecommunications industry, marking the end of a long period of 
our being subject to other's control in this regard. With State 
Science and Technology Commission approval, a State Engineering 
and Technology Research Center for Digital Exchange System has 
been set up in the Information Engineering Institute. It will 
become the leader of China's digital exchange industry, and is 
expected to yield an output value of 1.2 billion yuan this year. 
  Shi Quan, deputy commandant of the PLA Information 
Engineering Institute, is in charge of the development task. A 
recorded talk made by him follows: 
  [Begin recording] The successful development of the product 
has made China one of the few countries capable of independently 
developing large and medium program-controlled digital 
exchanges. It has ended the situation in which China's 
telecommunications network is built exclusively with foreign 
products, as well as the situation in which foreign products 
dominate the whole world. The product's successful development 
has won honor for both the PLA and the Chinese nation. No 
doubt, our country has grasped the technology. For this reason, 
we are certain that after the technology's application is 
popularized, we will be able to provide better security to the 
telecommunications network, and to keep the lifeline of 
telecommunications in our own hands. Since the new product's 
design is particularly suitable to China's conditions and 
market, to popularize its use is of great significance to 
opening up our huge domestic market. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Meng Xian (1322 6007 1344), XINHUA </F>
reporter Wang Zhiyun (3769 1807 5089), and XINHUA correspondent 
Meng Junyi (5536 0193 1837)] 
  [Text] Xian, 9 May (XINHUA) -- In the past three 
consecutive years, the Shaanxi Military District has been 
"investigating 1,000 companies." A large number of leaders and 
organ cadres have been visiting localities, inspecting actual 
situations, and performing concrete tasks. They have found a 
new way of performing economic tasks in an effort to properly 
develop the militia and reserve forces. The General Staff and 
General Political Departments recently conveyed their 
experiences to all military units. 
  To enable Shaanxi's militia and reserve forces to play their 
full roles as a new force in facilitating the material and 
spiritual civilization drive, the Shaanxi Military District 
party committee has been organizing and conducting the campaigns 
since 1991. It has been investigating 1,000 companies annually 
and has checked all of Shaanxi's grass-roots companies once. 
More than 400 leading cadres at army, divisional, and 
regimental levels and a large number of organ cadres have 
visited various townships, towns, rural areas, plants, and mines 
to conduct investigations and studies. They have thoroughly 
understood the situation of 3,337 grass-roots companies, and 
have rendered responsive assistance to their various 
construction endeavors. 
  While eating, staying, working, and training with officers 
and men of various grass-roots units, leading cadres at various 
levels and organ cadres have understood many conditions that 
could not have been learned if they remained in their offices. 
They have also resolved many problems that had been obstructing 
grass-roots units' progress for a long time. Shangluo 
Prefecture, situated in the Qinbashan hilly areas, produces 
abundant special local products. However, the masses had been 
poor for a long time because they had a poor concept of 
commodity economy and thick forests and deep ravines had 
hampered the smooth distribution of goods. Some 130 cadres from 
Shangluo Military Subdistrict and various county and city 
people's armed police departments have visited the rural areas, 
and have held over 30 training classes on commodity trade in 
separate localities. Moreover, through various channels, they 
have also raised and established special funds and have 
organized a large contingent of long-distance transporting and 
marketing personnel consisting some 50,000 militiamen. They 
have transported lots of mountain products and special local 
products to large and medium cities, including Xian, Baoyi, and 
Xianyang. Their annual sales have amounted to over 100 million 
yuan and the militiamen's annual per capita income has reached 
more than 1,700 yuan. While changing their operating 
mechanisms, some large and medium enterprises and military 
industry enterprises in Xian city have encountered problems. To 
resolve the problems, some 30 leading cadres from the Xian 
Military Subdistrict and from its people's armed police 
departments have led task forces to conduct studies and 
ideological and political work on young militiamen of more than 
120 large and medium enterprises. They have provided technical 
training to young militiamen who were temporarily laid off, and 
encouraged them to engage in tertiary industries. In addition, 
they have established more than 600 comfort-extending militia 
units, and have raised over 70,000 yuan to help impoverished 
families. Consequently, they have resolved the problems, 
thereby creating conditions for enterprises to deepen reform. 
  The investigative and studying process has also been a 
process of summarizing and accumulating experiences. By 
conducting the "investigation of 1,000 companies" in the past 
three years, the Shaanxi Military District has formulated a set 
of new concepts and methods, and has accumulated new experiences 
in various aspects, including ways to organize the militia and 
reserve forces to join in the material and spiritual 
civilization drive, to facilitate tasks on comprehensively 
rectifying social order, to perform rescuing and 
relief-supplying work, to participate in key construction 
projects with a regularized system, and to support military 
training with productive labor. According to statistics, in the 
past three years, the militia has participated in over 500 key 
construction projects, and has established more than 3,200 
economic entities that support military training with productive 
labor. The militia's role as a "front army" in economic 
construction has become more and more prominent. 
  The large number of investigative and studying activities 
have changed the workstyle of leading cadres at various levels 
and organs in Shaanxi Military District. A situation has 
emerged whereby people, labor, and funds have been moving toward 
grass-roots units. Shaanxi Military District commander Wang 
Zhicheng has visited all the people's armed police departments 
in 107 Shaanxi counties and cities, and has conducted 
investigation and studies in more than 900 militia companies. 
He has gone deep into the Qinbashan area, has slept on common 
beds with militia companies and militiamen who are guarding 
railway tracks there, and has drunk water from the same wells as 
they. He has conveyed instructions and provided assistance and 
guidance to various militia companies. To help impoverished 
areas develop endeavors that would support military training 
with productive labor, Zhao Lianchen, political commissar of the 
Shaanxi Military District, has visited over 50 of Shaanxi's 
poorest counties in more than two months. He has mulled and 
sought methods and measures with grass-roots cadres, and has 
proposed, after carrying out studies, four suggestions with 
guidelines. The suggestions have been approved by the 
provincial authorities. When commenting on their feelings about 
going deep into grass-roots units, many cadres said: Our work 
style has become more realistic, obstacles have been cleared, 
and our relations with the masses have become closer. We have 
eventually eliminated the old concept that people's armed police 
work was not important.

  [Text] Fuzhou, May 21 (CNS) -- According to a provincial 
meeting on land administration recently held here, Fujian has 
decided that it will not approve in principle the setting up of 
new economic development zones. Those items with good prospects 
for their economic result will be directed to use wasteland, 
waste slope and waste hills there. 
  By the end of last April, the province has seen 116 economic 
development zones of various kinds being approved with a total 
of land area already being developed or to be developed in the 
near future reaching 104 square kilometres and some 1077 items 
with foreign capital of U.S.$3.49 billion have been introduced 
into these zones. Despite noticeable achievements have been 
made, these zones, however, have occupied too much cultivated 
land, leading to strong reactions from the society. 
  The province canceled 34 such development zones with a total 
area of 292 square kilometres and will continue its guidance for 
construction of such zones there. Development of those zones 
which have been developing at rapid speed and achieved good 
economic efficiency will speed up and their experiences will be 
spread, those failing to have their items and funds in place and 
failing to implement their contracts should be canceled and 
those engaging in land speculation will be dealt with according 
to law, even revoking their land utilization rights.

  [Text] Jinan, 30 Apr (XINHUA) -- During a recent 
inspection of rural work in Shandong, Comrade Song Ping said: 
Whether or not agriculture, the foundation of our economy, can 
really be strengthened is a major issue that concerns the whole 
nation's food supply, the entire national economy's development, 
as well as social stability. We should not neglect agriculture 
at any time and under any circumstances and instead should try 
every possible means to ensure its even more rapid and greater 
development. 
  From 19 through 30 April, Song Ping successively inspected 
work in nine counties under Weifang and Zibo Cities in the 
separate company of CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
Member and Shandong Provincial CPC Committee Secretary Jiang 
Chunyun, provincial CPC Committee Deputy Secretary and Governor 
Zhao Zhihao, provincial CPC Committee Deputy Secretary and 
Secretary General Han Xikai. He went deep into enterprises, 
villages, peasant families, and paddy fields to talk with 
grass-roots cadres and the masses of peasants. Song Ping said: 
To strengthen agriculture's status as the foundation of the 
economy, we must keep on increasing investment; great 
development will not come without considerable investment. It 
is necessary to establish and improve a new agricultural 
investment mechanism to increase investment in agriculture 
through a variety of channels. The state will increase 
investment, but this alone will not be enough. We should make 
full use of surplus labor in the rural area and attach 
importance to accumulation of labor results. At the same time, 
we should guide village and town enterprises into supplementing 
agriculture with industry and institutionalize and standardize 
this practice as early as possible to guarantee actual extension 
of funds for supporting agriculture. 
  Song Ping went straight to villages and peasant families 
every time he arrived at a county. When inspecting village and 
town enterprises, he said: Developing village and town 
enterprises is an important way for the rural area to march 
toward a comparatively well-off standard of living. Sole 
reliance on farming is not enough to bring about a comparatively 
well-off standard of living in the countryside; you must 
vigorously develop village and town enterprises. Shandong's 
village and town enterprises have been enjoying rapid and 
healthy development since reform and opening up to the outside 
world and have now developed into a major sector. For the period 
ahead, Shandong should continue to make full use of village and 
town enterprises' flexible mechanisms and center on the main 
objective of establishing a socialist market economy to 
intensify reform and promote improvement in the standard, 
product quality, and operating scale of village and town 
enterprises. 
  During his inspection, Song Ping also stated his views on 
issues such as strengthening the development of grass-roots 
party organizations and developing household garden farming.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Shanghai strengthens its state-owned </F>
enterprises"] 
  [Text] Following General Secretary Jiang Zemin's 
instructions on "making even greater efforts from now on to 
improve large and medium state-owned enterprises," the Shanghai 
Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have regarded 
the improvement of state-owned industrial enterprises as the 
major basis for Shanghai's development and have stepped up the 
reform and structural readjustmens of state-owned industrial 
enterprises, made them increase their sales income, profit 
delivery and tax payment, and foreign exchange earnings year by 
year. As a result, the state- owned industrial enterprises are 
continuing to play a dominant and backbone role in Shanghai's 
industry and economy. 
  According to statistics, the total sales value of Shanghai's 
state-owned enterprises rose year after year -- 15.7 percent in 
1991, 10.9 percent in 1992, and 2.3 percent in 1993, as compared 
with the year before. The 1993 sales income amounted to 158.3 
billion yuan, accounting for 56.6 percent of the total sales 
income of Shanghai's independent-accounting industrial 
enterprises. In the three years, the total amount of profit 
delivery and tax payment made by state-owned 
independent-accounting industrial enterprises rose 15.7 percent 
in 1991, 1.7 percent in 1992, and 12.9 percent in 1993, over the 
previous year. In 1993, their profit delivery and tax payment 
totalled 21.1 billion yuan, accounting for 55 percent of the 
total amount made by Shanghai's independent-accounting 
industrial enterprises. In 1993, the state-owned industrial 
enterprises covered in local budget earned $2,196 million in 
foreign exchange from export trade, and their earnings accounted 
for 29.5 percent of Shanghai's total foreign exchange earnings 
in the year. 
  Shanghai has enhanced the overall strength of its 
state-owned 
industrial enterprises mainly because of its efforts in 
deepening reforms and changing the operational mechanisms of 
enterprises. At present, most of Shanghai's state-owned 
industrial enterprises have been given the decisionmaking power 
in operation. The ratio of mandatory plans has dropped to 2.4 
percent in Shanghai. The number of products subject to price 
control by the municipal government has been reduced to seven. 
The state-owned industrial enterprises have made great efforts 
to open up market with the development of products of high 
marketability, quality, and economic returns. In 1993, the 
sales rate of their products exceeded 98 percent. In the 
meantime, new internal operational mechanisms are taking shape 
within enterprises. The labor contract system, operating and 
marketing mechanism, development mechanism, and motivational 
mechanism have been gradually set up, and the local accounting 
system is converging with the international accounting practice. 
As of the end of 1993, the 1,118 state-owned industrial 
enterprises covered in local budget were practicing the labor 
contract system for full-time workers, as well as the job post 
contract system [shang gang he tong zhi 0006 1511 0678 0681 
0455]. These systems, concerning 1.49 million workers and staff 
members, have helped reduce surplus personnel, widen the wage 
difference, and arouse the enthusiasm among workers and staff 
members. The number of marketing personnel in state-owned 
enterprises have generally increased, and they now account for 2 
to 3 percent of the total number of workers and staff members. A 
sales contract system has been implemented. In Shanghai, 147 
enterprises (involving 1,108 factories) have been given the 
import-export trade authority. In 1993, the foreign exchange 
earnings from their export trade totaled $835 million, up 38 
percent from 1992. 
  In recent years, Shanghai's state-owned industrial 
enterprises have accelerated the shift from an adaptive 
structural readjustment to a strategic structural readjustment. 
They have invested more than 50 billion yuan in technological 
transformation focusing on a number of key projects, and have 
imported advanced technology and equipment. As a result, more 
than 1,400 old state-owned enterprises have greatly improved 
their products, technology and equipment, so that their 
technological level remains higher than other industrial 
enterprises in Shanghai. Shanghai has accelerated the 
development of a number of new pillar industries and 
technologies, based on state-owned industrial enterprises. In 
1993, the total sales volume of six pillar industries -- iron 
and steel, automobile, telecommunications equipment, power 
station equipment, petrochemical, and household electric 
appliances -- amounted to 106.9 billion yuan, accounting for 33 
percent of Shanghai's total industrial sales value. 
  In recent years, a number of Shanghai's state-owned 
industrial enterprises, using foreign capital and local private 
funds, have run joint ventures or turned themselves into limited 
liability joint-stock companies. In 1993, the total sales 
income of those joint ventures and limited liability companies 
whose shares are under state control was 236.7 billion yuan, 
accounting for 84 percent of Shanghai's total industrial sales 
income; and the total amount of their profit delivery and tax 
payment was 32.8 billion yuan, accounting for 84 percent of the 
total profit delivery and tax payment made by all industrial 
enterprises in Shanghai. 
  Many of Shanghai's state-owned industrial enterprises are 
old 
enterprises with old factory buildings, old equipment, and old 
products. During the course of shifting to socialist market 
economic structure, their efforts to improve economic efficiency 
are impeded by their economic setup, industrial structure, and 
internal weakness. This is why some state-owned industrial 
enterprises are having difficulties and a small number of them 
are operating in deficits, while other state-owned industrial 
enterprises continue to play a dominant role in economy. To 
deal with the problem, the municipal party committee and the 
municipal government, acting in accordance with General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin's instructions on "having a new concept of 
development and truly switching onto the track of enhancing 
economic efficiency," are continuing to deepen reforms, adopt 
effective measures, and strive to make all Shanghai's 
state-owned enterprises operate successfully.

<F P=106> [By reporters Wu Fumin (0702 1788 3046) and Chen Jiming </F>
(7115 4949 2494; first two paragraphs are editor's note)] 
  [Excerpt] Shanghai, 15 May (XINHUA) -- Shanghai 
municipality's decision-making level and deficit-ridden 
enterprises' staff and workers worked with one heart to make up 
deficits. They composed "a stirring song of great Shanghai" 
under the condition of a socialist market economy. 
  An important experience gained by Shanghai's enterprises in 
their efforts to solve thorny problems and make up deficits was 
that it is necessary to get rid of pessimism and to boost 
confidence in striving to become stronger and to stand on one's 
own feet. After we have cultivated such a spirit, we shall be 
able to see the future and hope for state enterprises, to tap 
their potential, and to rejuvenate deficit-ridden state 
enterprises. 
  The decision-making level of Shanghai, which is ambitiously 
building itself into an international economic, banking, and 
trade center, is worried about the problems confronting nearly 
200 deficit-ridden enterprises. This year it is planned to make 
efforts to solve thorny problems encountered in reform. 
Rejuvenating the deficit-ridden state enterprises that once 
generated a large amount of wealth for the state is, no doubt, 
"the most heavy task of all" and has become the focus of 
people's attention. 
  Therefore, a campaign to solve thorny problems and to make 
up 
deficits was launched in great Shanghai. One competent 
entrepreneur after another composed a stirring song for the 
Chinese nation to courageously forge ahead under the burden of 
heavy tasks on the stage of economic reform. 
<H5>  The Leadership and the Rank and File Are of One Mind; They </H5>
Fight To Win or Die 
  Large and medium state enterprises are the backbone of the 
national economy. Shanghai turned approximately 500 billion 
yuan over to the state in the past four decades or so. Of the 
amount, 80 percent was contributed by industrial workers. 
According to statistics, in the past few years, Shanghai's 
total industrial output accounted for 57 percent of its gross 
national product, while large and medium state enterprises 
captured 51 percent of its total industrial added value. It 
will be very difficult for Shanghai to promote economic 
development if its state enterprises are not invigorated. It 
was precisely on the basis of this understanding that the 
Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee and the Shanghai municipal 
government made up their minds to take advantage of the turning 
point to gear their efforts to the needs of the market, to fully 
use Shanghai's strong points, to score splendid achievements 
once again, and to launch a campaign to help state enterprises 
solve thorny problems and make up deficits. 
  On 27 January 1994, Wu Bangguo, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai party 
committee; Jiang Yiren, vice mayor of Shanghai in charge of 
industry and the economy; and their party arrived at the 
Shanghai Corduroy Factory, an enterprise that had generated a 
large amount of foreign exchange but suffered huge losses, to 
discuss measures for making up deficits. Holding factory 
Director Liu Tianfu's hands, Wu Bangguo said: We must let an 
enterprise like the corduroy factory whose products maintain 
good quality, capture a certain share of the market and 
rejuvenate economic returns. 
  Led by the municipal economic commission, more than 10 
Shanghai municipality departments, including financial, 
planning, labor, environmental protection, and social security 
departments, banks, and the textile industry bureau repeatedly 
visited the corduroy factory to assess plans for solving 
problems and making up deficits. They decided to address its 
problems by looking into both their root cause and symptoms so 
that the enterprise could score splendid achievements once again. 
  This was merely a scene of the determination of Shanghai's 
decision-making level to succeed in launching the campaign to 
solve thorny problems for enterprises and to make up their 
deficits. 
  "Handle the most difficult task and reach the most 
unattainable goal." Shanghai municipality was determined to 
expedite enterprises' "transformation of operating mechanisms 
and establishment of a modern enterprise system" through 
comprehensive and mutually supportive reform measures and by 
combining its overall development program with readjustment of 
industrial structure and distribution in a bid to enable 
deficit-ridden state enterprises which have the hope of being 
revived to invigorate and restore their "make-blood" function 
like the corduroy factory through the "transformation of 
operating mechanisms and establishment of a modern enterprise 
system" and to extricate themselves from difficulties, once and 
for all, within three years. As regards those enterprises 
without the hope of making up deficits, other solutions, such as 
mergers, moving to other locations, changing production lines, 
reorganization, and declaration of bankruptcy, will be found for 
them. A municipal government office meeting presided over by 
Mayor Huang Ju formally decided that the first batch of 43 
deficit-ridden state enterprises must improve their economic 
performances this year. Taking into consideration the fact that 
state enterprise reform is a major systems engineering task, the 
meeting required all functional departments to implement all the 
make-up-deficit plans, targets, measures, schedules, and 
responsibilities. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By reporter Lu Wangda (0712 4986 1129): "Shanghai Closes </F>
Down Four Illegal Publications"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 19 May (RENMIN RIBAO)--The press and 
publications administration and the industrial and commercial 
administration in Shanghai recently took joint action to ban a 
number of illegal publications. Four newspapers and journals, 
including SHANGHAI GUSHI BAO [SHANGHAI STOCK MARKET JOURNAL], 
were closed down, and the units running these newspapers and 
journals were fined. 
  While the stock market in Shanghai was developing, many 
books 
and journals about the stock market were published and sold 
well. Some units found that the business of publishing such 
material was profitable. They disregarded state laws and 
regulations, and illegally published and distributed these types 
of publications to the population. According to complaints made 
by the masses, the Huangpu District Industrial and Commercial 
Administrative Bureau discovered that some of the publications 
sold openly in front of various major securities companies in 
Shanghai were of questionable origin. Through the investigation 
of the Shanghai Press and Publications Administration, the four 
newspapers and journals, SHANGHAI GUXUN BAO [SHANGHAI STOCK 
NEWS], HUGU KUAIXUN [EXPRESS REPORT ON SHANGHAI STOCKS], 
SHANGHAI GUSHI BAO [SHANGHAI STOCK MARKET JOURNAL], AND CAITONG 
ZHOUXUN [WEEKLY FINANCIAL REPORT] were illegal publications 
which had been published without the approval of the relevant 
authorities. The industrial and commercial inspection team of 
Nanjing Road Central in Huangpu District recently inspected a 
university printing house, and confiscated the above- mentioned 
publications that had been printed there, including nearly 
100,000 copies of the newspapers and 7,000 copies of the weekly 
journals. 
  According to the investigation, SHANGHAI GUSHI BAO, run by a 
university in Shanghai, published 39 issues and nearly 1 million 
copies over the past six months; SHANGHAI GUXUN BAO, run by a 
research institute published 27 issues and nearly 1.09 million 
copies over last four months. The management over these 
publications was not orderly, and the income from their 
distribution was received in cash and was never entered in the 
accounting books. The publications were all distributed and sold 
by unlicensed hawkers. 
  The responsible officials of the Shanghai publications and 
business administrations told reporters that no country in the 
world would permit the illegal publication of newspapers and 
journals which were not registered with the authorities. The 
departments concerned in Shanghai will continue to properly 
manage the publications market.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 23 (XINHUA) -- The individual trading 
of foreign exchange has become a favorite investment business 
among residents in China's largest economic center. 
  According to the latest statistics, a total of 15,000 deals 
involving 100 million U.S. dollars have been concluded since 
last December, when the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China 
and the communications bank started such business. 
  At present, individuals with foreign currency in hand may 
exchange it according to the rates on the international foreign 
exchange market. 
  Until late last year all privately owned foreign exchange 
had 
to be deposited in banks. 
  Wang Qinpei, an official of the Shanghai branch of the 
Communications Bank, said that the individual savings deposits 
in foreign exchange in banks in Shanghai had risen from less 
than 100 million U.S. dollars in 1987 to 2.4 billion U.S. 
dollars by the end of last year, accounting for about one fifth 
of the country's total private foreign exchange savings deposits.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 22 (XINHUA) -- The daily improved 
investment conditions in Zhejiang Province, east China, are 
attracting an increasing number of foreign investors. 
  The province actually used foreign investment totalling 220 
million U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year, an 
increase of about 70 percent over the same period last year. 
  Last year saw the province approve the establishment of 
4,400 
foreign-funded enterprises, involving a contractual investment 
of 3.7 billion U.S. dollars. Actual use of the investment 
amounted to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. 
  A provincial official said that the growth was mainly 
fuelled 
by the better service of local government departments; the 
increase of direct foreign investment and construction of large 
infrastructure projects. 
  Once a project is approved, the government will follow its 
construction closely and is always ready to offer a helping 
hand, he added. 
  Of the contractual investment last year, about 300 million 
U.S. dollars came directly from enterprises solely funded by 
foreign investors. 
  More and more overseas investors have shown interest in 
energy development and transport projects in the province, the 
official noted.

  [Text] Zhejiang province has passed tough new laws against 
child labour, a sign that the problem, long denied by Beijing, 
may be on the rise. 
  The province has been targeted by humanitarian groups in the 
past for widespread use of children in its booming township and 
private enterprises. 
  Officials in Zhejiang's southern coastal city of Ruian 
uncovered 102 child workers in private enterprises in a single 
day in December 1991. 
  The new laws, reported in the China Labour News, specify 
fines of up to 15,000 renminbi [Rmb] (HK$13,320) per child for 
enterprises employing children 16 years or under. In cases of 
children killed while working, enterprises are fined Rmb20,000 
and could face closure. They must also pay parents or guardians 
up to Rmb20,000 in compensation as well as Rmb400 for funeral 
expenses. 
  While China's Foreign Ministry has denied the existence of 
child labour in the country, semi-official groups have admitted 
its emergence as economic opportunities draw children -- 
especially those from the countryside -- into factories. 
  The vice-secretary of the China Youth Development 
Foundation, 
Xi Jieying, said in 1991 that child labour was "becoming 
serious", especially in Zhejiang and Fujian. 
  An estimated 4 million children between the ages of six and 
19 (about 2.5 percent of the total) drop out of school every 
year in China, an ample pool for sweatshop factories to draw on. 
  Labour analysts said the new laws in Zhejiang, which are 
substantially tougher than those in other parts of the country, 
reflect a general drive to solve labour problems in order to 
defuse criticism of rapid industrial growth. 
  "The problem of child labour in China is surfacing now which 
gives more legitimacy to opponents of reforms," Pian Chua, of 
the Hong Kong-based labour rights group Asia Monitor, said. 
  "The issue relates to internal stability as well as 
international criticism, so they have to deal with it," he said. 
  Chua said the passage of new laws would be an important 
step. 
  "It may take a while to eradicate the problem but it is an 
important deterrent for some violators and it gives local 
authorities more power to carry out inspections," he said. 
  The State Council passed its first law banning child labour 
in April 1991. Since then provinces have been allowed to pass 
specific sanctions and implementation measures. 
  The issue of child labour in China first came to 
international attention at the end of 1991 when U.S. labour and 
consumer groups called for a boycott of toys made in China 
during the Christmas season over allegations of the use of child 
labour. 
  Subsequent investigations by Hong Kong groups found only 
scattered evidence of child labour in toy factories but the 
problem was already well documented. 
  A survey of foreign-funded enterprises by Guangdong 
authorities in Shenzhen and Dongguan in 1988 found that 70 
percent were illegally employing children. 
  A subsequent year-long campaign in the province uncovered 
3,206 children employed illegally and authorities later cracked 
a group organising the trafficking of children from Guangxi to 
factories in the special economic zones of Guangdong.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 21 (XINHUA) -- A new periodical 
titled "Economy of Guangdong and Hong Kong" has recently come 
off press in south China's Guangdong Province. 
  With six issues per year, the periodical is published for 
industrial and commercial circles in Guangdong and Hong Kong. 
  It will carry the market-oriented policies formulated by the 
party and state as well as targets and measures adopted by 
Guangdong Province in its economic reform and economic 
development. 
  The periodical is also aimed at promoting the exchange of 
economic information between Guangdong and Hong Kong and Macao, 
and analyzing development trends and consumption tendencies in 
the three places. 
  Every issue of the periodical, which comprises 80 to 100 
pages, will be printed in the form of picture album. 
  Two deputy governors of Guangdong Province are advisors to 
the periodicals. 
  In the first issue of the periodical, there are columns such 
as economic forum, global trade, economic forecasts, commercial 
and business situation in Guangdong, and Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  In the foreward to the periodical, Peng Shubao, director of 
the Guangdong Provincial Economic Commission, noted that at 
present, the relations between economic development trends in 
Guangdong and in Hong Kong and Macao are becoming increasingly 
closer. 
  The economic relations between guangdong, Hong Kong and 
Macao 
will produce an important impact on the economic expansion of 
the Asian-Pacific region in the next one or two decades, Peng 
said.

  [Text] Disgruntled workers at a Guangdong state-owned 
factory recently ended a protracted industrial dispute by 
ousting their manager and appointing a shop-floor worker as 
their new boss. Work started again at the Shaoguan Mineral 
Refining Plant in northern Guangdong in late April, almost three 
months after the factory's 500 workers went on strike 
complaining that the factory manager, Zeng Wanhua, was an 
incompetent brute. The strike took more than two months to 
resolve. Zeng was replaced by a shop steward, Tang Zhenmao. 
  During this time the factory's losses piled up, forcing the 
Guangzhou branch of the China Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation to 
step in to pay salaries. "If you don't pay attention to the 
interests of the workers, they have the right to try to bring 
about changes," said the ebullient Tang, a worker in the 
mineral-separating room before being chosen by workers to 
replace the now retired Zeng. 
  Tang said the 200 renminbi (about HK$178) per month salaries 
at the Shaoguan factory were "pitiable" and forced most workers 
to moonlight to make ends meet. "[We] ousted Zeng to save 
ourselves," he said. 
  While Chinese officials supply regular reports of labour 
disputes in foreign-owned companies, little is heard on the 
subject of state-run factory disputes. This may be because of 
China's socialist roots, which assert that workers' interests 
are the same as managers in the state sector. China's 
constitution does not give workers the right to strike. 
  "As a socialist country, we believe the interests of workers 
and the enterprise are the same. So we are not going to 
advocate strikes," said Wang Chidong, the deputy director of the 
grass-roots work department of the All-China Federation of Trade 
Unions (ACFTU) in Beijing. "We feel strikes make labour 
relations too tense. It is the most extreme kind of behaviour," 
Wang said. 
  But with disputes rising, officials say a new "three-party 
principle" (involving government, enterprises and unions) will 
be adopted to replace the increasingly ineffective work of 
Communist Party cells in smoothing labour frictions in state 
enterprises. 
  An ACFTU document on the role of unions in China's move to 
corporatise its state-owned sector was submitted to Beijing 
leaders in April. It calls for the establishment of 
German-style supervisory committees composed of management and 
labour representatives. 
  Chinese labour ministry officials also say a better 
arbitration system will be set up to deal with the growing 
number of labour disputes which cannot be resolved internally. 
Arbitration centres in China handled 11,400 disputes in 1993, 
up 51 per cent on a year earlier, although no breakdown of the 
number involving state sector workers was given. 
  The ACFTU admits that 7 million workers in state enterprises 
suffer "inferior living conditions", and even poverty. 
Nationwide, more than 40 per cent of state enterprises -- which 
employ close to 200 million workers -- lost money in the first 
quarter of this year. 
  Recent official reports from the state-sector-dominated 
provinces of Liaoning, Sichuan and Hubei show a growing number 
of state enterprise workers taking similar "self preservation" 
measures as were adopted in Shaoguan. These mainly involve 
dumping the factory's core business to go into more lucrative 
trades. But increasingly, they also include ousting incompetent 
managers and recouping months of unpaid salaries.

  [Text] Shenzhen, May 22 (XINHUA) -- The Shenzhen Special 
Economic Zone (SEZ) in south China has overtaken Shanghai, the 
traditional electronics producer, and Beijing to become the 
leading producer and exporter, according to Wang Dianfu, 
chairman of the Shenzhen Electronics Trade Association. 
  Wang, who used to head China's National Electronics 
Corporation before the present Ministry of Electronics was 
reestablished in 1993, said that 60 percent of Shenzhen's 
electronics products are sold outside China, leading the rest of 
the country, 
  He said there are 1,500 electronics enterprises in the SEZ, 
producing 18 billion yuan (about two billion U.S. dollars) in 
annual output value. With 160,000 employees, the electronics 
industry in the city made 10.8 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. 
dollars) in output value, he said. 
  Most of Shenzhen's electronics enterprises are 
trans-provincial enterprise groups such as Konka, Huaqiang-Sony, 
Hitachi, heading China in the production of such products as 
colour TVs, tape recorders, microcomputers, telephone 
switchboards and software. 
  Among Shenzhen's 55 hi-tech enterprises, 39 are in the 
electronics industry, the expert said. A number of hi-tech 
electronics enterprises are being constructed in the city, with

  [Text] The city of Lichuan recently inflicted public 
punishments on a batch of leading cadres at and above the 
district deputy director level. These cadres were found to have 
accepted gifts and cash in violation of party and government 
discipline. 
  Over the past few years, some of Lichuan's party members and 
cadres fell into the habit of throwing banquets on such 
occasions as weddings, funerals, birthdays, housewarmings, and 
so on, at which they procured gifts and cash from guests. 
  Investigations show that by 10 March 1994, a total of 27 
leading cadres at and above the deputy district director level 
had been involved in such activities, including four cadres at 
the county deputy magistrate level, 16 cadres at the district 
director level, and seven cadres at the district deputy director 
level. While five cadres had each accepted more than 10,000 
yuan in cash from others, fifteen cadres, including four at the 
county magistrate level, had violated party and government 
discipline in these activities. 
  In view of this situation, the Lichuan City CPC Committee 
and 
Lichuan City People's Government recently decided to strictly 
enforce party and government discipline by meting out two 
inner-party disciplinary warnings and two administrative 
warnings to four cadres at the district director level and the 
district deputy director level, respectively; issuing a circular 
criticizing seven cadres at the district director level and the 
district deputy director level; and reporting the cases of four 
corrupt cadres at the county magistrate level to the relevant 
autonomous prefectural party committees and discipline 
inspection commissions for punishment in accordance with the 
relevant personnel management regulations.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report on the political resolution adopted </F>
by the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional 
Commmittee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference on 21 May 1994; from the "Regional News Hookup" 
program] 
  [Text] The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous 
Regional Commmittee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] Committee was held in Lhasa from 
13 through 21 May. It approved the government work report 
delivered by regional Chairman Gyaincain Norbu; the report on 
the implementation of the 1993 plan and on the 1994 draft plan 
for economic and social development; the report on the 
implementation of the 1993 budget plan and the 1994 draft budget 
plan; and the work reports by the higher people's court and the 
higher people's procuratorate. 
  The session held that in the past year, the people of all 
nationalities in Tibet, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
party's basic line, earnestly implemented the 14th CPC National 
Congress guidelines, and deepened reform and opening up wider in 
close conjunction with the objective of establishing a socialist 
market economic structure and of modernizing the region, thereby 
quicking the pace of construction, promoting the development of 
productive forces, and scoring fresh achievements in all fields 
of endeavor. 
  The session held that the government work report has 
factually summarized the work over the past year, objectively 
analyzed the existing problems and difficulties, and explicitly 
put forth the basic principles and fighting goals of the work in 
1994. These principles and goals are inspiring the people in 
their advancement and can be accomplished through assiduous 
efforts by the people of all nationalities throughout Tibet. 
Regional CPPCC committee members have expressed concern over, 
and made suggestions and opinions on outstanding contradictions 
and problems, such as high price rises, poor performance of 
state-owned enterprises, low income of peasants and herdsmen, 
disorderly cultural markets, inadequate medical and health 
services in farming and pastoral areas, corruption of all kinds, 
and crimes in some localities. They hope the regional 
government will persist in the principle of fostering both 
material progress and cultural and ideological progress and 
attaching equal importance to both and adopt effective measures 
to solve these problems. 
  The session held that 1994 is a crucial year for Tibet to 
carry out reform in an all-round way, to launch package reform 
programs, to achieve breakthroughs in key areas, and to 
accelerate the establishment of a socialist market economy. We 
must steadfastly take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic 
guidelines as our guide; and must comprehensively carry out the 
guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, as well as 
the guidelines of the fourth and fifth enlarged plenary sessions 
of the fourth regional party committee. We must expedite the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure and do 
everything we can to change Tibet's backward transportation, 
energy supply, and infrastructure. We must turn our advantage 
in resources into an economic edge for achieving a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the regional economy. We must 
step up the building of democracy and the legal system, as well 
as the building of socialist spiritual civilization. We must 
improve party work style, promote a clean and honest government, 
launch an in-depth struggle against splittism, safeguard the 
motherland's unification, strengthen national unity, safeguard 
political stabiltiy, and promote the progress of society in all 
fields. The work in all fields must serve and be subordinate to 
the overall interests of grasping the opportunity, deepening 
reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability; and must be conducive to the proper handling of the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability. 
  The session called on CPPCC committees at all levels and 
their members across Tibet to hold high the banner of patriotism 
and socialism, to diligently study Volume 3 of the "Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping," to earnestly carry out the guidelines 
of the current session, to bring into play their talent to serve 
the central task of economic construction, to conduct effective 
political consultation and democratic supervision, to take an 
active part in the administration and discussion of state 
affairs, to unite all forces that can be united and mobilize all 
positive factors, to pool the efforts of all, and to make their 
share of contributions to the maintenance of Tibet's political 
and social stability. 
  The session called on CPPCC committees at all levels and 
their members across Tibet, to be led by the regional party 
committee, to rally still closer around the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core; to emancipate 
their minds; to heighten their spirits; and to work hard and 
advance in a pioneering spirit in striving for new victories in 
Tibet's reform and opening up as well as the building of two 
civilizations.

<F P=106> [By Reporter Wang Rantong (3769 3544 1749) and Correspondent </F>
Niu Yaming (3662 0068 5407): "The Regional Organizational, Wage, 
and Social Old-Age Pension Insurance System Reform Work 
Conference Opens"] 
  [Excerpts] On the morning of 6 May, the regional party 
committee and government cosponsored a work conference on 
reforming the organizational, wage, and social old-age pension 
insurance systems and implementing our region's plan for 
organizational reform as approved by the party Central Committee 
and the State Council. The conference also respectively made 
overall arrangements for reforming "these three systems." 
  Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the regional party committee 
and 
chairman of the regional government, chaired the conference. 
  Bai Enpei, deputy secretary of the regional party committee, 
made a speech at the conference. 
  Yun Bulong, vice chairman of the regional government, 
relayed 
Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech made at the national organizational 
reform work conference and the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council's circular on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Region's plan for party and government organizational reform. 
[passage omitted] 
  Bai Enpei stressed: To change the government functions, we 
should make two key breakthroughs. First, according to the 
principle of separating government functions from enterprise 
management, we should realistically delegate to enterprises the 
decision-making powers that belong to enterprises so that 
enterprises will really become legal entities that are 
independent for management, responsible for their own profits 
and losses, and capable of developing and restricting themselves 
as well as main bodies for market competition. The government 
departments should mainly use economic and legal means and 
necessary administrative means to regulate and control markets 
and guide enterprises and will not interfere in enterprises' 
production and management or manage enterprises' affairs. 
Second, We should set up and perfect the macroeconomic 
regulation and control system and use more laws, policies, and 
economic levers to guide, regulate, and control markets so as to 
promote a sound operation of the national economy. Whether or 
not the government organs can smoothly change their functions 
depends on the changes of ideas. Changing functions and 
delegating powers to lower levels is essentially related to the 
readjustment of rights and interests. Leaders of all 
departments should have a common understanding about 
organizational reform. According to the requirements for setting 
up the socialist market economic system, we should proceed from 
the overall economic situation, adopt resolute measures, and 
ensure the changes of functions. 
  Bai Enpei stressed: The reasonable distribution of office 
personnel is of vital importance to the organizational reform. 
The party committees and governments at various levels should 
overcome the feeling of fearing difficulties and be determined 
to achieve the reform in this aspect. Office cadres are the 
precious wealth of the party and the state, and talents are the 
most valuable resources. Therefore, we should regard the 
organizational reform as a favorable opportunity for developing 
talents resources and emancipating productive forces. We should 
not only pay attention to improving the office personnel 
structure and the personnel quality but also try every means 
possible to widen various channels to arrange these personnel. 
[passage omitted] 
  Bai Enpei finally pointed out: After this conference, the 
region will comprehensively carry out the "reform of the three 
systems." The party committees and governments at various levels 
should pay high attention to this, strengthen leadership, 
carefully organize forces, and conscientiously implement the 
reform plan. I believe that our region will certainly achieve 
hoped for results in the "reform of the three systems" according 
to the party Central Committee's requirements. [passage omitted] 
  Responsible persons of the Ministry of Personnel attended 
the 
conference. 
  Present at the conference were responsible persons of the 
regional-level organs, departments, commissions, general 
offices, bureaus, and mass organizations. 
  Also attending the conference were responsible persons of 
various league and city party committees, administrative 
offices, governments, and departments concerned.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Women's Rights Most Secure in Capital"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has taken the lead in protecting women's 
rights by strictly forbidding discrimination in the workplace 
and setting quotas on the number of female leadership positions 
in city and county government. 
  The Standing Committee of the Municipal People's Congress 
[MPC] on Saturday approved the city's Regulations Governing 
Implementation of the Law For The Protection of Women's Rights 
and Interests. 
  The Municipal Committee for Protection of Women's Rights and 
its subsidiary neighbourhood groups are the watchdogs of women's 
rights. 
  The new regulations, passed by the 10th Plenary Session of 
the Beijing MPC Standing Committee, are a first in China. 
  Similar regulations are expected to be drafted and adopted 
by 
other municipalities, provinces and regions within the next two 
years. 
  The law requires the municipal and county women's rights 
committees to be composed of leading officials from local 
government, courts, procuratorates, and local organizations of 
the Women's Federation, Trade Union and Youth League. 
  The national Law for the Protection of Women's Rights and 
Interests (LPWRI), which was introduced in early 1992, requires 
the State to set up institutions to safeguard women's 
constitutional rights. 
  Accordingly, the Beijing Committee for Protection of Women's 
Rights was set up in October 1992. 
  Another key part of the new law stipulates that women should 
be given a minimum number of seats in the Municipal and County 
People's Congress, local administrations and enterprises. But 
it does not give an exact percentage which is considered proper. 
  Women account for almost half of the 10.5 million people 
living in the capital. 
  Currently, there are about 368,000 women officials including 
the vice mayor in Beijing, or 44.5 percent of the total. Women 
account for about 33 percent of the MPC deputies. 
  However, women only occupy 11.9 percent of the city's senior 
posts. 
  The new regulations specify in detail that any 
discrimination 
against women in school enrollment and employment constitutes a 
violation of the law.

  [Excerpts] A few days ago, the municipal intermediate 
people's court held an open trial meeting to strictly punish a 
group of serious criminal offenders sabotaging social order. 
Four criminal offenders guilty of the most heinous crimes, 
namely Zheng Yunfeng, Peng Liping, Li Jian, and Yang Wenbo, were 
escorted to the execution ground and were executed by shooting. 
They were guilty of murder, robbing persons of their property, 
unlawfully purchasing and marketing of firearms and ammunitions, 
stealing goods, indulging in corruption, and acting indecently. 
Eleven criminals, namely Wu Tao, Zhang Jianguo, Guo Qinghua, 
Zhao Jun, Sui Baosheng, Guo Yaohui, Yu Xiaoyan, Yang Sheng, 
Huang Jianguo, Wu Jin, and Wang Hui, were sentenced to death 
through first rulings and deprived of their lifelong political 
rights. They were guilty of looting, murder, acting indecently, 
intentionally harming persons, stealing goods, and committing 
arson. Strict sanctions were also imposed on their companies. 
  Zheng Yunfeng, a jobless person in the municipality, was 
executed. He had once been imprisoned for committing crimes. 
Around 1400 on 15 May in 1993, together with his companions, 
Zheng, carrying knives, sneaked, as premeditated, into an 
apartment located on the east street of Guanganmen station of 
Xuanwu District. Posing as a repairman, he opened the door of 
Liu's house in the apartment. He killed Liu and robbed Liu of 
250 Yuan, video recorders, gold ornaments, and some other 
materials. 
  Criminal Peng Lipeng, who was executed, had been released on 
bail for medical treatment. He had been punished by security 
organs on several occasions for violating laws and committing 
crimes. While released on bail for medical treatment in March 
of 1992, he unlawfully purchased eight individual-made firelocks 
and ammunition with killing and wounding capacity. At about 
1600 on 16 April 1992, criminal Peng, carrying the firelocks, 
sneaked into a residential house located on Guanganmenwai Street 
of Xuanwu District and looted 1,000 yuan. On the afternoon of 6 
May in 1992, Criminal Peng ganged up with Li Fusheng, a jobless 
person (who was sentenced to life imprisonment), carried 
firelocks and sharp knives and sneaked into the No. 214 
residential house on Guanganmenwai Street and looted more than 
100 yuan. On the afternoon of 3 May 1992 at a Sichuan food 
store and a Shandong food store, criminals Peng and Li, carrying 
firelocks and knives, picked quarrels with two young men, beat 
them, and robbed them of their 60 yuan. [passage omitted] 
  Wu Tao and Zhang Jianguo, who were sentenced to death 
through 
first rulings, had once been punished by security organs for 
violating laws. On the morning of 25 June in 1993, Criminals Wu 
and Zhang, carrying daggers and some tools for criminal 
purposes, sneaked into a room of a certain building in the 
municipality and robbed Lodgers Kang and Li of their money. 
These two criminals threatened the lodgers with knives and 
robbed them of $30,000 and $10,000 Renminbi Yuan, two mobile 
phones, and gold ornaments. To do away with the witness, 
Criminal Zhang used the fire extinguisher in the room to beat 
Kang and Li to unconsciousness and also ganged up with Wu Tao to 
kill them with knives. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, May 22 (XINHUA) -- Sales volume of 
supermarkets in the Chinese capital have achieved an 
increasingly high proportion in the total retail sales volume in 
Beijing. 
  Statistics from the Beijing municipal commercial commission 
show that the transaction volume in 27 supermarkets in Beijing 
topped 100 million yuan last year. In 1992, there were just 15 
supermarkets. 
  Total sales volume of the 27 supermarkets reached 9.465 
billion yuan, accounting for 17.2 percent of Beijing's total 
retail sales volume last year. 
  Commercial experts said that large department stores are 
winning more customers and playing an increasingly important 
role in market competition as they have the priority in market 
information, feedback and power. 
  A series of reforms has been carried out in the major stores 
involving labor, personnel and distribution. Employees' 
enthusiasm was greatly increased as reforms were promoted in 
such commercial groups as the Beijing Department Store, the 
Xidan Department Store, the Dongan Market and the Beijing 
Friendship Store. 
  In addition, a dozen new supermarkets are catching up. The 
Lufthansa Friendship Commercial Center, the Scite Tower, the 
County and Township Trade Center, Xidan Shopping Center among 
others that were built in the past several years have become new 
shopping attractions.

(5135 2737 2885): "State Council Information Office Holds Press 
Conference, Deng Pufang Introduces Preparations for Far East and 
South Pacific Region Games for Disabled"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 May (XINHUA) -- The Information Office 
of the State Council held a press conference for Chinese and 
Foreign journalists at Beijing's Guoji Hotel today. Deng 
Pufang, president of the Chinese Federation for the Disabled and 
chairman of the organizing committee of the sixth Far East and 
South Pacific Games for the Disabled, introduced to Chinese and 
foreign journalists the preparations for the games. 
  Deng Pufang said: The Sixth Far East and South Pacific Games 
will be held in Beijing from 4 to 10 September. More than 2,000 
disabled athletes from more than 40 countries and regions will 
participate in the competition of 14 events. China will send a 
600- member delegation to attend. 
  He said: The Chinese Government has attached great 
importance to these games. Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, and Chen Xitong, secretary of the Beijing Municipal 
CPC Committee, serve as the honorary chairmen of the organizing 
committee. State Councillors Li Tieying and Peng Peiyun are the 
honorary leaders of the Chinese delegation. 
  Deng Pufang said: The Far East and South Pacific Games for 
the Disabled is of the largest scale and highest standard for 
the disabled in the region. It is the largest international 
comprehensive games held in China in this century after the 11th 
Asian Games and also the first international games for the 
disabled hosted by China. Preparations for the games are in 
full swing. We warmly welcome disabled athletes from various 
countries and areas in this region to gather in Beijing during 
the games to talk about their friendship, win good results in 
the games, display the special styles of the sports of the 
disabled, and, seizing this opportunity, promote the "10-year 
Asia-Pacific disabled persons" activities and bring about the 
progress and development of the undertakings for the disabled. 
  Deng Pufang held: Holding the Sixth Far East and South 
Pacific Games successfully will enable disabled persons to 
display their unremitting efforts in self-improvement, their 
indomitable spirit, and their ability for all-round 
participation in social life and, in the meantime, will promote 
the understanding and friendship of the disabled persons and the 
peoples of the various countries of the Far East and South 
Pacific, facilitate the coordinated economic and social 
development of the region, and help raise the awareness of the 
public in helping the disabled and develop the humanitarian 
spirit. 
  Deng Pufang said: China has scored eye-catching achievements 
in the sports for the disabled. At the last two Olympic Games 
for the disabled and other important competitions, China's 
disabled athletes won 205 gold medals, 102 silver medals, and 45 
bronze medals and broke 36 world records. At the Fifth Far East 
and South Pacific Games for the Disabled held in Japan's Kobe in 
1989, the 56-member Chinese delegation won 99 gold medals, 
winning the first place in the total number of gold medals. 
  Deng Pufang concluded that he was convinced that inspired by 
the spirit of "equal participation, friendship, and progress," 
the sixth Far East and south Pacific region games will be a 
success. 
  Zhang Baifa, executive vice mayor of Beijing and executive 
vice chairman of the organizing committee of the Sixth Far East 
and South Pacific Games, and Wang Siquan, secretary general of 
the organizing committee, attended today's press conference and 
answered questions by reporters.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Jingwei (6392 4842 4885): "Army Officers </F>
Transferred to Civilian Work Should Be Placed Appropriately 
Without Any Deviation"] 
  [Excerpt] The 1994 provincial meeting on the placement of 
army officers converted to civilian work was held in 
Shijiazhuang on 6 May. Cheng Weigao, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, made a speech at the meeting. He 
stressed: Army officers transferred to civilian work should be 
placed appropriately without any deviation in an effort to 
satisfy the army, the localities, higher levels, and the people. 
Chen Yujie, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, 
presided over the meeting and offered his opinions on 
implementation of the guidelines of the meeting. Li Haifeng, 
vice governor of the province, also spoke at the meeting. 
  Cheng Weigao said: The congratulatory letters sent by 
Comrades Jian Zemin and Li Peng on 3 April to the national 
meeting on placement of army officers transferred to civilian 
work have expressed the importance of the work of placing army 
officers transferred to civilian work and have clearly pointed 
out the orientation of this work. Party committees and 
governments at all levels must conscientiously study and 
successfully implement the guidelines of this meeting in order 
to appropriately place army officers transferred to civilian 
work. Success in army building requires not only the efforts of 
military units, but the great support and coordination of local 
party committees and governments. Successful placement of army 
officers transferred to civilian work is of extremely great 
significance in stabilizing the army, consolidating national 
defense, and enhancing the combat effectiveness of the army. 
Today when we are carrying out reform and opening to the 
outside world with the purpose of quadrupling the 1980's GNP by 
the end of this century, what is most needed is stability. 
Failing in army building, there will be no stability. Party 
committees and governments at all levels must consider the 
placement of army officers transferred to civilian work as a 
major political task and grasp it in a resolute manner. 
  In recent years, the province has achieved great results in 
economic construction. These results are inseparable from the 
fact that a large number of army officers who transferred to 
civilian work have become backbone forces on various fronts. 
Such officers have high political expertise, a strong sense of 
organizational discipline, a high level of education, and 
certain specialized skills and knowledge. So, we welcome the 
transfer of such officers. 
  When talking about the placement of army officers 
transferred 
to civilian work in this and the past few years, Cheng Weigao 
said: Each year, We transferred two to three thousands of army 
officers to civilian work thanks to the hard work of personnel 
departments and organizational departments at all levels. 
Generally speaking, the work in this aspect has been good. At 
present, although we are faced with the tasks of streamlining 
organizations and expanding enterprises' autonomy in employment 
and personnel affairs, we still should try every possible means 
to appropriately place army officers transferred to civilian 
work. 
  Cheng Weigao stressed: This year, in placing army officers 
transferred to civilian work, we must handle affairs in strict 
accordance with state policies on placement of army officers 
transferred to civilian work. All localities and all units are 
banned from formulating policies of their own. In placing such 
officers, we should resolutely avoid such unhealthy tendencies 
as entering through the back door. We should satisfy the 
demands of such officers to the maximum in line with their 
respective characteristics and specialities. We should try 
every possible means to resolve their problems with regard to 
lives, houses, jobs, and schooling and employment of their 
children so that they can fully display their role in economic 
construction. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, May 22 (XINHUA) -- Qinghe County in north 
China's Hebei Province is now processing and dealing in more 
than 4,000 tons of cashmere annually, which accounts for two 
thirds of the country's total or half of the world's total. 
  The county has become the country's largest base for 
production of cashmere. 
  Every year, it exports over 3,000 tons of cashmere to more 
than 20 countries and regions, such as Japan, Italy, Britain, 
Germany and the United States. Many foreign businessmen 
commented that the world's cashmere is mainly in China and 
China's cashmere is mainly in Qinghe. 
  The county started to develop the industry of cashmere in 
1984. After ten years of efforts, 18 out of the total 20 
townships of the county have established the industry of 
cashmere. 
  There are now more than 100 industrial enterprises of 
cashmere in the county with over 7,500 wool-carding machines and 
40,000 employees. Among them were three Sino-foreign joint 
ventures. 
  Helped by the research institute of the Tianjin Textile 
College, enterprises of cashmere in Qinghe County managed to 
developed a series of unique technology for processing cashmere, 
which raises the rate of extracted cashmere by 20 percent and 
reduces the rate of length-damaged cashmere by 12 percent 
compared with that of its imported technology and equipment. 
  The county has established perennial business relations with 
over 30 domestic foreign trade enterprises and more than 100 
overseas cashmere firms across the world.

  [Summary] As of 6 May, the province as a whole sowed 
18.074 million mu of wheat, accounting for 91 percent of the 
planned acreage, and sowed 49.58 million mu of field crops, 
accounting for 50.6 percent of the acreage that should be sown, 
at a slightly more rapid pace than the corresponding period last 
year. Thus far, 20 counties (cities), including Shuangcheng, 
Bayan, Zhaodong, Zhaoyuan, Hulan, and Binxian counties, have 
basically fulfilled the sowing of field crops. It is estimated 
that most areas in the province will complete the sowing of 
field crops by mid-May. This year, in mapping out sowing plans, 
the province has increased the acreage for corn by 18 percent 
and acreage for rice by 10 percent, while reducing the wheat 
sowing acreage by 10 percent and the soybean sowing acreage by 8 
percent. As for cash crops, the acreage for beets was projected 
at 4.7 million mu, an increase of 30 percent over last year. 
The acreage sown with flex and flue-cured tobacco has basically 
stabilized. Various localities have done a lot of painstaking 
and arduous work to increase fund input in spring farming. Thus 
far, the province as a whole has raised 5.73 billion yuan of 
funds for spring plowing, 790 million yuan more than the 
corresponding period last year, or an increase of 16 percent. 
Of this sum, 3.74 billion yuan have been raised by peasants 
themselves, an increase of 27.2 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Reporters Liu Lihua (0491 5461 5478) and Su Tong </F>
(5685 1749): "When Shareholding Enterprises Distribute Stocks 
and Dividends, Individuals and Legal Persons Gain Their Profits, 
But Do State-Owned Stocks Gain Their Due Share?"] 
  [Text] Jilin has transformed some state-owned enterprises 
in line with the shareholding system in a planned manner in 
order to rationalize enterprises' property right relations. 
This measure has enabled some enterprises to gradually 
extricate themselves from their longstanding status as 
subordinates to the government and to maintain and increase the 
value of most of the state-owned assets. However, in the actual 
process of operating such a mixed economy, loss of state-owned 
assets resulting from the establishment of state-owned stocks 
merely in name exists in some enterprises at varying degrees. 
Pertinent persons asked: Who should represent the state-owned 
stocks, which account for 50 percent of the capital stock? Who 
should protect their interests? 
  The loss of state-owned assets in shareholding enterprises 
is 
reflected mainly in the evidently unfair distribution of 
dividends in addition to the underestimation of the value of 
state-owned assets in the process of the transformation in line 
with the shareholding system. For instance, state-owned stocks 
are excluded in enterprises' distribution of dividends; even if 
dividends are distributed to state-owned stocks, different rates 
are applied in violation of the principle of same rights and 
same profits for same stocks, with the dividends to the stocks 
owned by individuals and legal persons usually higher than those 
to state-owned stocks; enterprises seldom open special accounts 
of the dividends distributed to state-owned stocks or turn the 
dividends over to the departments in charge of state-owned 
asset, and most of the dividends are used by enterprises without 
reimbursement; when distributing stocks, shareholding 
enterprises apply different measures to state-owned stocks, 
legal person stocks, and individual stocks, either demanding 
abandonment of the right of state-owned stocks to be distributed 
with stocks and transferring the right to individual stock 
holders, or distributing cash dividends to state-owned stocks 
and stock dividends to other stock holders according to the face 
value of the stocks, or even distributing no stocks to 
state-owned stocks. 
  The above-mentioned situation is common nationwide, but the 
basic reason for enterprises' practice to disregard the rights 
and interests of state-owned assets, infringe on state 
interests, and cause the loss of state-owned assets lies in the 
stagnation of the reform of the state-owned asset management 
system. According to the analysis by pertinent persons, the 
function of ownership of state-owned assets is divided by 
various departments of the government, which take charge of 
state-owned assets from different angles, but none of which hold 
total and ultimate responsibility. This has led to a blend of 
government functions and asset management function and a blend 
of government functions and enterprise management, making the 
government take charge of too much of the things they should not 
have managed and fail to manage what they should have managed. 
The direct influence of this problem on the enterprises 
experimenting with the shareholding system is reflected in the 
failure in personifying the representatives of the rights to 
state-owned stocks. In form, representatives of the rights to 
state-owned stocks are assigned by state-owned bureaus, but the 
status, responsibility, and rights of these "representatives" 
have not been personified because the state-owned asset 
management system and responsibility system have yet to take 
shape. In some enterprises, the chairmen of the boards of 
directors are representatives of the state-owned assets, but 
they often exercise their duties as the chairmen of the boards 
of directors and forget about their duties as the 
representatives of the rights to state-owned stocks. Because of 
this, it is very difficult to appoint and appraise the chairmen 
and directors of the boards of directors and to fine appropriate 
persons to hold the responsibility for the management and 
operation of assets. In addition, there is also the problem 
that state-owned stocks and other stocks enjoy different rights. 
Stocks owned by individuals and legal persons are permitted to 
transfer and trade in the market, but state-owned stocks are 
not. No doubt, this is an unfair treatment to state-owned 
assets, and such a treatment is also harmful to maintaining and 
increasing the value of state-owned assets. 
  Pertinent departments have given the "prescription" to 
personify the representatives of state-owned stocks as soon as 
possible and enable state-owned stocks to enjoy the same rights 
and same profits as other stocks, namely to adjust the 
relationship within and outside enterprises and establish a 
brand-new standardized operating mechanism of enterprises. 
First, we should separate the function of ownership of 
state-owned assets from the administrative function as soon as 
possible and establish special organs to operate state-owned 
assets, which are authorized by the government to serve as 
representatives of state-owned assets to take charge of the 
operation, profit-making, and transfer of state-owned assets. 
Large enterprise groups and extra large enterprises may be 
directly authorized by the government to manage state-owned 
assets. Second, we should further improve the internal 
management system of shareholding enterprises so that their 
rights and profits will conform to their responsibilities and 
they are operated in line with the standardized requirements. 
Decisions should be made in a democratic manner to ensure that 
they are scientific. Meanwhile, we should step up efforts to 
draw up necessary laws and regulations on the shareholding 
system to make it more transparent and to enhance the 
supervision over it by public opinion.

  [Text] The first national day on "Prevention and Control of 
Iodine-Deficient Diseases" fell on 5 May. On 5 May, more than 
600 people in Changchun took to the streets to conduct the 
propaganda on prevention and control of iodine-deficient 
diseases. Six cars were mobilized to help conduct the 
propaganda. More than 30 propaganda centers were set up on the 
streets. More than 100,000 copies of propaganda bills were 
distributed. Papers carrying more than 100 propaganda items 
were published. More than 150 banners with such slogans were 
carried. 
  It was informed that our province is one of the areas with 
serious iodine-deficient diseases. The first general 
investigation made in 1978 showed that 58 counties (cities) in 
the province had areas with iodine-deficient diseases, 750,000 
people or 5.6 percent of the people in the province suffered 
endemic goiter, about 70 percent of the people in the villages 
where these diseases were seriously spread suffered the 
diseases, and 0.22 percent of the people suffered cretinism. So 
far, our province has 270,000 patients suffering endemic goiter 
and more than 2,000 patients suffering cretinism.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 20 May (XINHUA) -- ZHONGGUO SHIBAO 
published an editorial today, "Second Ku-Wang Meeting Should Be 
Held As Soon As Possible To Close the Rift Between the Two 
Sides." The editorial affirms the statement issued on 17 May by 
Wang Daohan, chairman of the mainland's Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], and appeals to both 
sides to discard prejudices over some side issues and to decide 
on the date for the second Ku-Wang meeting as soon as possible 
to overcome the stalemate between the two sides arising from the 
"Qiandao Lake Incident." 
  The editorial says: ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan on 17 May 
issued a statement on the "Qiandao Lake Incident," which pointed 
out that the two sides should put national interests first, and 
earnestly draw a lesson by viewing the case and issues cropping 
up in the process of handling the case rationally, calmly, and 
objectively. As Wang Daohan suggested, in the wake of the 
incident, the ARATS and the Strait Exchange Foundation should 
especially step up contacts and increase dialogue between 
top-level officials so as to eliminate misunderstandings. The 
editorial deems this as the mildest and most reasonable 
statement issued by the mainland since the occurrence of the 
incident. 
  The editorial clearly points out: Regardless of the 
complexity of the case, the "Qiandao Lake Incident" is, after 
all, an incident related to public order. It will be a grave 
mistake to use this case to negate the mainland's existing 
social mores or even the entire Chinese nation's blood 
relationships. 
  The editorial says: It is definitely impossible to dismiss 
overnight the more than four-decade-long separation, 
confrontation, and hostility between the two sides. However, at 
the least, we should not let this misunderstanding and 
alienation continue and should actively seek ways for gradual 
and reasonable solutions. For this reason, we place high hopes 
on the second Ku-Wang meeting. We deeply believe that the 
cross-strait relationship is a historical question and naturally 
can be solved through a tortuous course. The "Qiandao Lake 
Incident" has further complicated this course. Now is the 
important time for us to straighten out facts and analyze twists 
and turns to increase common understanding. It is hoped that 
the authorities of both sides can make good use of the time.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Six Members of Taiwan Religious Sect </F>
Interrogated in Fujian"] 
  [Text] Six priests, including Hsia Yu, from the Taiwan 
Tien-tao [Providence] religious society's "Secret Light Sect" 
and the "Tien-chen [Celestial Endowments] Holy Temple," were 
interrogated and educated by police in the city of Quanzhou a 
few days ago for setting up pulpits, delivering sermons, and 
recruiting followers in Quanzhou and Zhangzhou, in Fujian. 
  According to official newspapers, since June 1992, the six 
priests, including Hsia Yu, have entered Fujian repeatedly, 
carrying large quantities of "Tien-tao" classics and ceremonial 
equipment under the cover of making investments and running 
factories. They have made wide contacts with possible followers 
and propagated "Tien-tao" teachings everywhere. They did not 
hesitate to spend large sums of money to support the 
construction of pulpits. They set up eight fixed altars and one 
temporary altar in eight places, including Zhuanghu Lane and 
Donghu Road in downtown Quanzhou, the town of Fuqiao, the city 
of Nanan, Huian County, and the city of Zhangzhou and recruited 
more than 400 followers. 
  On 17 April this year, while once again making their way 
into 
Fujian and conducting activities there, the six priests, 
including Hsia Yu, were caught red-handed. 
  The Quanzhou police are currently interrogating and 
educating 
the six priests, including Hsia Yu. Altar masters at home, 
including Xu Huilian, were given subpoenas and education and 
were ordered to remove their pulpits.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station editor Huang Zhiqing: "Boycotting </F>
Travel to Mainland China Hurts Travel Agencies' Interests"; from 
the "News and Current Events" program] 
  [Text] Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] has 
directed the boycott of economic, trade, cultural, and other 
exchanges with Mainland China under the pretext of the Qiandao 
Lake incident. Travel agencies were the first to bear the brunt 
of the boycott, following the announcement of a boycott of 
package tours to Mainland China as of 1 May by the Taipei 
Association of Travel Agencies. As of now, cross-strait economic 
exchanges and trade remain brisk and are unstoppable, while the 
travel agencies which play a leading role in the boycott have 
suffered misfortune and incurred heavy losses. 
  The boycott of mainland-bound travel has inflicted heavy 
economic losses on travel agencies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and 
Mainland China, with the losses suffered by those in Taiwan 
especially heavy. Travel agencies who organize mainland-bound 
tours represent a sizable proportion of all travel agencies in 
Taiwan. In Taipei City alone, there are up to 100 travel 
agencies that operate mainland-bound tours. It is estimated 
that Taiwan's travel agencies incurred 200-300 million yuan in 
losses as a result of suspending mainland-bound package tours in 
April. Every year, the months of April through June are the 
peak season for mainland-bound travel. Boycott-induced losses 
incurred by travel agencies this year are inestimable. 
  The boycott of mainland-bound tours is against the will of 
the majority of travel agencies. Travel agencies raised strong 
objections when the boycott injunction was first issued on 13 
April. They noted that the Association of Travel Agencies had 
not consulted the organizations representing travel agencies 
when it announced the boycott. They also complained that the 
MAC should not use their business as a political bargaining chip. 
  The Qiandao Lake incident has been resolved. At the 
invitation of Mainland China's Association for Relations Across 
the Taiwan Straits, officials of the Straits Exchange 
Foundation, the victims' families, and relevant experts traveled 
to Hangzhou on 8 May to deal with post-incident matters. It is 
believed that efforts of relevant departments will lead to a 
reasonable resolution of matters arising from the Qiandao Lake 
incident. 
  The Association of Travel Agencies recently asked MAC to 
call 
off the boycott, citing the heavy losses suffered by travel 
agencies, the prospect of closure facing travel agencies, and 
attendant social problems. The MAC, however, asked travel 
agencies to continue the boycott on the grounds that Mainland 
China had not met three requests -- investigating the actual 
state of affairs, paying compensation in the aftermath of the 
incident, and determining who is to blame. This practice, which 
is driven by self-interest without regard to the interests of 
travel agencies, has compounded the woes of the latter who are 
already in deep trouble. 
  Problems of one kind or another are inevitable in the 
ever-expanding exchanges and contacts across the Taiwan Straits. 
What matters is how the relevant departments on both sides of 
the Taiwan Straits confront or resolve those problems. The 
Taiwan authorities have played up the Qiandao Lake incident, 
which is purely a criminal case, in order to politicize the 
incident and to use the incident as a bargaining chip to 
strengthen their political leverage with Mainland China. Such 
actions will only hurt, not benefit, the sound development of 
cross-strait relations. 
  The boycott of mainland-bound travel has inflicted 
unnecessary losses on travel agencies on the both sides of the 
Taiwan Straits. However, people should heighten their vigilance 
and prevent the boycott from snowballing and causing more 
problems of a greater magnitude.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 9 May, Governor Ruan Chongwu 
was interviewed by Wen Chang-tao and two other producers of the 
Taiwan Public Television Station. The three reporters of the 
Taiwan Public Television Station arrived in Haikou on 7 May. 
The aim of their visit was to shoot and produce a special 
television film reflecting the scenery and investment 
environment of Hainan in a bid to help Taiwan businessmen invest 
in Hainan. 
  At the request of the guests, Ruan Chongwu gave an account 
of 
Taiwan businessmen investing in Hainan. He said that at 
present, the volume of investment by Taiwan businessmen ranks 
second among that from outside the border, and the actual 
investment volume is about $400 million. Talking about the idea 
of jointly developing Hainan Island in cooperation with 
Singapore recently put forward by the Taiwan side, Ruan Chongwu 
said: We welcome Taiwan's manufacturers to come to run 
enterprises in Hainan at present and in the future, as we did in 
the past. Talking about trades which most urgently need large 
amounts of investment by Taiwan businessmen at present, Ruan 
Chongwu said: Hainan welcomes Taiwan businessmen to invest in 
any trade, but it is easiest to invest in agriculture at present 
because Hainan and Taiwan have similar conditions and 
environment in agriculture. With their technology, products, 
experience in management, and methods for promoting sales, 
Taiwan farm owners will find it very convenient to invest in 
Hainan, and the amount of investment required is relatively 
less. As a matter of fact, Taiwan businessmen who have already 
invested in agriculture in Hainan have obtained handsome 
profits. Also, we are willing to cooperate with the Taiwan side 
in industry, industries which use new and high technology, and 
the construction of infrastructure. We have also worked out 
comprehensive compensation methods to ensure more preferential 
treatment will be given to enterprises which have invested in 
basic construction projects. Ruan Chongwu also answered 
questions on Hainan's planning and development prospects raised 
by the Taiwan reporters.

  [Text] Taipei, May 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan Power Company said 
Friday [20 May] that it will not build a fifth nuclear power 
plant because no more adequate sites exist in Taiwan. 
  The company is currently in the construction planning stages 
for Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant, which is scheduled to 
be entirely equipped and completed by 2006. 
  In order to meet the rising demand for electricity island 
wide, Taipower said it has been working to develop solar, wind, 
and tidal energy sources. 
  Meanwhile, Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang said the 
government would prefer not to use nuclear power, but that the 
three extant nuclear power plants were built in accordance with 
the energy diversification policy set by prior administrations. 
  Currently, there are a total of 57 power plants in Taiwan 
capable of generating 19.315 million kilowatts of electricity. 
About 30 percent of Taiwan's energy comes from coal, 26.6 
percent from nuclear plants, 24.7 percent from diesel fuel, 13.3 
percent from hydro power, and 5.3 percent from natural gas, 
Chiang said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang said the government's policy to build the fourth 
nuclear plant will not change despite overwhelming opposition to 
the plant by villagers who live near the proposed site. 
  Chiang said he was not surprised by the result of a public 
poll in Kungliao Sunday [22 May], and said he will ask the 
state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) to step up its dialogue 
and communication with people in Kungliao, a village some 35 km 
east of Taipei. 
  In a vote Sunday, some 5,669, or 96.1 percent of the voters, 
voted against the plan to construct the nuclear plant in 
Kungliao, while 176 voters supported the plan. 
  Taipower officials said that it attached great importance to 
the vote, and will study the reason for villagers' opposition 
before embarking on another round of communications with them. 
  They noted however that only 58 percent of the eligible 
voters turned out to vote. 
  Taipower also announced that it will subsidize electricity 
fees for Kungliao villagers as soon as the budget for the fourth 
nuclear power plant is approved by the legislature. 
  Taipower President Chang Shih-min will lead Taipower 
officials to visit Kungliao leaders Tuesday to solicit their 
support for the plan. 
  Chang said that the vote is not legally binding and that the 
plant should be constructed for the welfare of the nation. 
Plans to construct the plant should not be swayed by the vote 
alone, he said. 
  Chang reiterated that the fourth nuclear plant will boast 
the 
world's best security and environmental facilities. 
  Chao Kuo-tung, chief of Kungliao Village, said he was 
thrilled that most of the voters were against the plan, but said 
that the 11,000 residents in Kungliao do not have enough 
strength. 
  Chao asked Taipei County Magistrate You Ching to hold a 
public poll in Taipei County to solidify the opposition force. 
You said he supports the idea of a poll but will have to spend 
time studying the issues first. 
  Anti-nuclear activists said they are not content with this 
"triumph" and have planned other actions to prevent construction 
of the plant' Legislator Chou Po-lun said that if the ruling

  [Text] Another big step has been made in Sino-Russian 
cooperation in disposing of nuclear waste. Chang Chung-chien, 
chairman of the board of Taipower, and a concerned Russian 
department have reached common understanding on specific matters 
in this regard. The two sides will sign a letter of intent in 
the near future regarding nuclear waste disposal, thereby 
binding Russia to be Taiwan's partner in disposing of our highly 
radioactive nuclear waste. Furthermore, cooperation between the 
two sides will expand to cover the analysis of highly 
radioactive nuclear waste material and the study of nuclear 
reactors. This will be the first tangible result we have 
achieved since deciding that nuclear waste will be disposed 
primarily outside the country. 
  At the invitation of the Russian National Academy of 
Sciences, Chang Chung-chien recently went to Moscow again to 
discuss cooperation in the disposal of nuclear waste. He said 
the primary purpose of his Moscow trip was to express the great 
importance Taipower attaches to the cooperation. He also 
visited the nuclear energy research facility of the Russian 
National Academy of Science. He said: Russia has a solid 
foundation for the study of nuclear energy. Russia has 
expressed strong desire to cooperate with us and Taipower will 
be delighted to see successful cooperation between the two sides 
in the disposal of nuclear waste.

  [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Russia may 
cooperate in nuclear waste research and disposal, a Taiwan power 
company (Taipower) spokesman said Saturday [21 May]. 
  Taipower may commission Russia to dispose of high-level 
radioactive waste, the spokesman said. 
  Taipower Chairman Chang Chung-chien visited Moscow earlier 
this week at the invitation of the Russian Academy of Science to 
inspect its nuclear energy research facilities. 
  Chang has reached consensus with Russian academy officials 
on 
cooperation in high-level nuclear waste research and treatment, 
the spokesman said. 
  "The two sides may sign a letter of intent in the near 
future 
confirming their willingness to cooperate in nuclear waste 
disposal," the spokesman said. 
  In addition to waste treatment, the two sides may [words 
indistinct] operation to the study of radioactive substances and 
technology for high-level nuclear waste disposal. 
  The Russian academy is expected to draft a definitive 
framework for bilateral cooperation in these fields in the near 
future, the spokesman noted. 
  To test Russia's treatment technology and determine 
transport 
routes, Taipower may first send a batch of medium-level nuclear 
waste to Russia for disposal, the spokesman said. 
  "We'll make sure that the cooperative project is carried out 
without violating any international regulations or causing 
unnecessary environmental disputes," he added. 
  Chang left Moscow Friday for Norway where he will attend an 
international energy resources development seminar.

  [Text] Huang Kun-huei, chairman of the Mainland Affairs 
Council [MAC], Executive Yuan, pointed out yesterday [22 May] 
that in order to conclude the tasks related to dealing with the 
aftermath of the Qiandao Lake incident, Mainland China should 
respond quickly to the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] proposal 
made in early April for a special meeting between the SEF and 
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS]. 
Chairman Huang Kun-huei added that whether the two 
nongovernmental organizations on both sides of the strait hold a 
special meeting on safety in the near future is not directly 
related to the convening of the second round of the Ku-Wang 
meeting. However, if the special meeting cannot be held for a 
long time, it will have an impact on arrangements for activities 
related to the Ku-Wang meeting. 
  Chairman Huang Kun-huei made these remarks when answering 
reporters' questions on whether MAC and SEF have started 
coordinating and having contact to push forward the second round 
of the Ku-Wang meeting. As for SEF chairman Ku Chen-fu and Vice 
Chairman Chiao Jen-he advocating to push forward the second 
Ku-Wang meeting based on the agreement on institutionalized 
contacts and talks between the two organizations, Chairman Huang 
Kun-huei said MAC and SEF have not yet discussed the issue.

  [Text] Taipei, May 20 (CNA) -- The prosecutor's Office of 
the Taipei District Court's Shihlin Branch on Friday [20 May] 
indicted two arms dealers on bribery charges in a major arms 
procurement scandal involving much of the navy's top brass. 
  Prosecutor Chen Jui-jen said that Cheng Cheng-kuang and Liu 
Shu of the Hsih Kuang Co., the Taiwan agency of an Italian arms 
supplier, were charged with violating the Corruption Punishment 
Act. 
  The two arms dealers were accused of offering and paying 
bribes to two navy commanders who eventually helped the Hsih 
Kuang Co. win a bid to sell a reconnaissance ship to the navy, 
Chen noted. If convicted, Cheng and Liu will face up to seven 
years in prison. 
  In addition, Liu, Hsih Kuang's president, was indicted for 
embezzling NT [New Taiwan] $2.5 million in company funds -- 
money which Cheng wanted to use to bribe a navy officer. He 
would face an additional five years in prison if convicted of 
the charge. 
  This is the first time indictments have been brought against 
civilians involved in the arms buying scandal, which came to 
light last December after the body of navy Captain Yin 
Ching-feng was found floating in the sea off Taiwan's 
northeastern coast. He was murdered before he could disclose 
corruption surrounding the award of lucrative military contracts. 
  In mid-April, military prosecutors indicted captain Kuo 
Li-heng, a navy weapons procurement officer who has been in 
custody since late last year, for corruption and leaking 
military secrets. 
  Kuo will be tried by a military court and will face either 
the death penalty or life in prison if convicted. He was 
charged with taking bribes totaling NT$12 million (US$446,096) 
offered by civilian arms dealers in exchange for military 
secrets. 
  Adm. Ku Chung-lien replaced Adm. Chuang Ming-yao as navy 
commander-in-chief a month ago after Chuang stepped down as a 
show of responsibility for the affair.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 23 (CNA) -- Both Taiwan and 
Mainland China will contribute U.S.$35,000 to the Pacific Basin 
Economic Council (PBEC) annually to help finance the 
non-governmental organization's day-to-day operations. 
  The Hawaii-based organization needs about U.S.$400,000 
annually to cover its expenses. The United States and Japan 
have annually contributed U.S.$42,000 each to finance PBEC 
operations. 
  Mainland China was just admitted to the PBEC while Taiwan 
joined the organization in 1983 under the name of "Chinese 
Member Committee of PBEC in Taipei." 
  The PBEC decided to accept the mainland, Russia and Colombia 
as its new members during a board meeting held here Sunday [22 
May]. 
  The mainland was admitted under the name of "PRC (People's 
Republic of China) Member Committee of the PBEC" instead of 
"China member committee" as was used in its original application. 
  Meanwhile, Taiwan's designation in the organization was also 
changed to "Chinese Taipei member committee of the PBEC" in line 
with its membership title in the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) Forum. 
  Three other PBEC members -- the United States, South Korea 
and the Philippines -- have also been renamed after their APEC 
membership titles. 
  Jeffrey Koo, president of the Taipei PBEC Committee, said 
the 
re-designation was aimed at facilitating the PBEC's bid to join 
APEC as an observer. 
  The PBEC, which is holding its annual conference here, will 
apply for APEC observer status in October, Koo noted. APEC is a 
17-member governmental-level forum founded in 1989 to promote 
economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Koo said Beijing once unsuccessfully tried to press a change 
in Taipei's designation as a prerequisite for its entry into the 
PBEC. Koo warned if the PBEC bowed to Beijing's pressure, Taiwan 
would withdraw from the organization and the PBEC would very 
likely be disbanded as a result. The PBEC smoothly settled the 
name issue by simultaneously asking several members to change 
their designation in line with their APEC membership titles. 
  The PBEC, which was founded in 1968 by a group of business 
leaders from the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and 
Australia, provides a forum for bankers and business executives 
in Pacific Basin countries to exchange views and forge 
cooperative ties. 
  PBEC authorities have named R.H. Fynmore, chairman of 
Australia's ADI group, as the organization's new head for a 
one-year tenure, and Gary Tooker, chairman of Motorola Co. of 
the United States, as his deputy.

  [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan will attend a 
worldwide meeting on trade, environmental protection, and global 
sustained development scheduled for June 10-11 in Geneva, an 
industrial official said Saturday [21 May]. 
  Lin Chih-sheng, a division chief in charge of industrial 
regulations at the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB), noted 
that the two-day meeting will be hosted by the secretariat of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  The world trade regulating body, which will be superseded by 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) next year, has as its top 
priority the balanced development of world trade and 
environmental protection, Lin said. 
  Major topics on the agenda include the relationship among 
free trade, environmental protection, and global sustained 
development, environmental protection costs versus trade 
policies, and the future direction of international cooperation, 
he elaborated. 
  In order to learn of the most recent developments in this 
regard, he said, Taiwan must be represented at the meeting. The 
bureau, however, has yet to decide on which delegates will 
attend the meeting, he added. 
  A Taiwan delegation, led by Vice Economic Affairs Minister 
Sheu Ke-sheng, is in Geneva this week for the fifth meeting of 
the GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership 
application. Taiwan was accepted as a GATT observer in 
September 1992 and is expected to become a full member by the 
end of this year. 
  Citing a faxed letter from IDB Deputy Director-General Ho 
Mei-liang who is among the 33-member delegation in Geneva, Lin 
said that the June 10-11 GATT meeting will be vital to future 
trade and production trends.

  [Text] Geneva, May 21 (CNA) -- A Taiwan trade delegation 
Friday continued tariff-reduction negotiations with world 
countries in its bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT). 
  The Taiwan delegation, headed by Board of Foreign Trade 
(BOFT) Director-General Y.C. Huang, Friday held informal 
bilateral tariff concession talks with delegations from Japan, 
Colombia, and South Korea. 
  The Japanese delegates urged Taiwan to adopt a zero-for-zero 
tariff formula on import products according to the Uruguay Round 
trade accords, and to remove area restrictions on automobile, 
motorcycle and farm product imports. 
  The Japanese negotiators also asked for the zero-for-zero 
tariff package on alcoholic beverages. This request was denied 
by the Taiwan delegation, but they reportedly conceded on beer 
imports from Japan. 
  Like the Japanese negotiators who were taking advantage of 
Taiwan's eagerness to join GATT before the world trade 
regulatory body becomes the World Trade Organization early next 
year, the Colombian delegates asked Taiwan for overall tariff 
cuts in general and on banana, citrus fruits, papaya and mango, 
in particular. 
  The Colombian negotiators, who expressed support for 
Taiwan's 
GATT bid, said they hoped Taiwan will abide by the "rules of the 
game" of the GATT-initiated Uruguay Round trade accords. They 
added that some non-tariff related barriers and "discriminatory" 
treatment against products from some areas are unacceptable. 
  Negotiators from South Korea and Taiwan concluded their 
negotiations amid a pleasant atmosphere, but "without concrete 
results," Y.C. Huang, Taiwan's chief negotiator, said. 
  The Koreans asked for lower tariffs on 153 import items. 
They demanded that Taiwan open its market to Korean apples, 
peaches and plums, arguing that South Korea has already opened 
its market to produce from other countries. 
  The Koreans also said that they are willing to share with 
Taiwan their experience in opening their domestic market to 
foreign rice. 
  The 33-member Taiwan degegation will hold further 
negotiations on tariff and non-tariff issues in the future to 
pave the way for Taiwan's GATT entry. 
  Taiwan has held first round tariff talks with a dozen 
nations, including Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, 
Hungary, Chile and Turkey. It held a second round of such talks 
with the U.S. in Washington earlier this month.

  [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- The state-run Export-Import 
Bank of the Republic of China [ROC] is planning to open a 
reprsentative office in Vietnam as part of its efforts to help 
promote the government's "southern strategy," a spokesman for 
the bank said Saturday [21 May]. 
  The strategy encourages Taiwan manufacturers to increase 
investment in Southeast Asia. 
  If all goes well, the spokesman pointed out, the Vietnamese 
office will be the bank's second such office in Asia. The bank 
established an office in Jakarta, Indonesia in 1990. 
  The bank, which renders services in overseas investment 
credit and insurance as well as medium and long-term 
export-import loans, will be able to give a helping hand to 
Taiwan investors intending to go to Vietnam, he elaborated. 
  Taiwan was the largest foreign investor in Vietnam at the 
end 
of 1993 with 117 investment projects totaling U.S.$1.53 billion. 
  Currently, only two Taiwan financial institutions maintain 
offices in the Indochinese country. The International 
Commercial Bank of China has a representative office in Ho Chi 
Minh City and the Cathay Investment and Trust Co., Ltd. 
maintains a branch in Hanoi. 
  The spokesman stressed that the export-import bank is 
willing 
to help pioneer Taiwan's overseas markets. 
  To help achieve the goal, he said, the bank opened offices 
in 
Mexico City, Mexico and Budapest, Hungary last year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- The Republic of China is 
considering loaning an additional U.S.$5 million to Vietnam to 
help the Indochinese country automate its agricultural industry, 
the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported Monday [23 May]. 
  To initiate the plan, Taiwan may establish a holding company 
in Vietnam which will provide the Vietnamese agricultural sector 
with farm machines, technical consultation, and after-sale 
services. 
  In addition, the Council of Agriculture is also studying the 
feasibility of sending agricultural experts to Vietnam to help 
out in forestation and forest conservation. 
  The proposed loan will be offered by the ministry's 
International Economic Cooperation and Development Fund (IECDF) 
established in 1989 to provide financial aid to needy developing 
countries. 
  During the past two years, IECDF has lent U.S.$30 million to 
Vietnam to expand a highway, U.S.$15 million to fund the 
development of small and medium-sized Vietnamese companies, and 
U.S.$10 million for the development of an industrial park to 
house Taiwan-invested factories. 
  According to Vietnamese Government tallies, Taiwan remains 
the top foreign investor in Vietnam, channeling U.S.$1.567 
billion into the country for 123 investment projects as of March 
28. 
  In 1993 alone, Taiwan investments in Vietnam totaled 
U.S.$388 
million, the second highest among foreign investors behind Hong 
Kong which sent U.S.$607 million in Vietnam, the tallies showed. 
Most Taiwan investments focused on footwear processing, food 
processing, textile, wood processing, construction, and 
construction material industries.

  [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang said Saturday [21 May] that Taiwan's indirect trade 
volume with Mainland China is helping to offset its trade 
deficit with Japan. 
  Chiang made the remarks Saturday while speaking on 
challenges 
to Taiwan's economy at Chinese television system headquarters. 
The speech was sponsored by GLOBAL VIEWS MONTHLY. 
  Chiang said that in 1993, Taiwan's indirect exports to 
Mainland China via Hong Kong reached U.S.$12 billion, almost 
offsetting its US$14.2 billion trade deficit with Japan. 
  He said the mainland market has become increasingly 
important 
to Taiwan despite the fact that Beijing is trying to isolate 
Taiwan internationally, and added that cross-strait economic and 
trade activities would be complementary except for Beijing's 
policies. 
  Chiang said that although Taiwan can be proud of its past 
economic achievements, it needs to focus on future development, 
which he said it can do by improving the environment for 
production technology. 
  He said Taiwan is experiencing a great change in its 
economic 
development that can be seen in the drastic trade surplus 
decrease, the shift in export markets from Europe and America to 
Asia, and the remarkable increase in exports to developing 
countries. 
  For example, he said, Taiwan had a trade surplus of 
U.S.$18.7 
billion in 1987, U.S.$16 billion of that with the United States. 
By 1993, he said, the trade surplus had declined to U.S.$7.8 
billion, of which U.S.$6.8 billion was with the United States. 
He estimated that this year's trade surplus will drop to U.S.$3 
billion. 
  Moreover, he noted, rising wages and labor costs, 
land-acquisition problems, the government's financial burden, 
and environmental protection disputes are making it hard for 
industries to survive. 
  Chiang said Taiwan needs to upgrade technology and 
industrial 
levels, as well as produce goods of higher added value and 
actively seek to join international economic organizations in 
order to ensure its continued economic development.

  [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Export orders received by 
Taiwan manufacturers amounted to U.S.$7.8 billion in April, up 
9.03 percent from the year-earlier level, the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs reported Saturday [21 May]. 
  But, compared with March, export orders declined by U.S.$11 
million, the ministry said. 
  Orders for telecommunications and information processing 
equipment, metal products and textiles increased in April, but 
purchase contracts for plastic and rubber products, electric 
appliances and transport equipment dropped. 
  Hong Kong remained the largest source of export orders, up 
12.74 percent from March. Compared with last April, orders from 
the British colony, a conduit for indirect Taiwan-Mainland China 
trade rose 39.55 percent. 
  Export orders from the United States and Japan increased 7.5 
percent and 3.67 percent, respectively, from the year-earlier 
levels. 
  Aggregate export orders placed with local manufacturers 
amounted to U.S.$29.09 billion in the first four months of this 
year, up 4.43 percent from the year before. 
  Economics Ministry officials said Taiwan's exports will 
gradually regain momentum in the coming months, judging from 
steady growth in export orders. 
  Exports grew a modest 2.3 percent in the January-April 
period, far lower than the originally targeted 7 percent growth. 
The lackluster export growth has prompted the government to 
adjust this year's economic growth target downward to 5.94 
percent from the previously-set 6.17 percent. 
  The officials attributed the slow export growth mainly to a 
rapid shrinking of labor-intensive industries here. For 
example, furniture, textile and footwear exports registered 
substantial declines during the four-month period. 
  The officials noted that as Taiwan has lost its competitive 
edge in such labor-intensive industries, the country should 
accelerate its development of capital and technology-intensive 
industries in order to maintain its niches in the world market.

  [Text] Taipei, May 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan's automobile and 
motorcycle exports rose substantially to new heights in 1993, 
the Industrial Development Bureau reported Friday [20 May]. 
  Bureau statistics show that more than 3,000 compact cars and 
320,000 motorcycles were exported last year, mainly to Asia and 
Europe. Only about half as many motorcycles were exported in 
1991. 
  Currently, there are 20 motorcycle and car makers and about 
500 motorcycle and car parts manufacturers in Taiwan. They were 
capitalized to the tune of US$5.2 billion and employed 120,000 
workers in 1993, or 5.6 percent of all Taiwan's manufacturing 
employees. 
  Locally made cars were first exported in 1986, and then just 
to the United States and Canada. In the past three years, 
automobile output increased an average 7 percent annually, with 
yearly output reaching 400,000 cars last year. The annual 
production of motorcycles is about 1.5 million. 
  The production value of auto and motorcycle parts 
manufacturers was US$11.3 billion last year, accounting for 5 
percent of the overall output value of the nation's 
manufacturing sector, bureau tallies show. 
  About 70 percent and 90 percent of automobile and motorcycle 
parts and components, respectively, were produced by Taiwan 
manufacturers in Taiwan rather than overseas, including some 
sophisticated car engines, frames and bodies, the bureau said. 
Many local makers have been producing made-to-order car and 
automobile parts and components for some leading international 
companies, the bureau added. 
  It said a new engine jointly produced by the industrial 
technology research institute and four local car makers -- China 
Motor, Yeu Tyan Machinery MFG, Yulon Motor and San Yang Motors 
-- will soon enter production. 
  Additionally, the semi-official China External Trade 
Development Council said it will lead a delegation composed of 
10 local car and motorcycle parts and components companies to 
Europe Sunday for a two-week-long promotional tour. 
  Parts manufacturers will meet with major German, French, 
British and Belgian car makers to seek original equipment 
manufacturing cooperation as part of their effort to further 
exploit European markets, the bureau said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan's manufacturing 
production is expected to post 5.41 percent growth for the 
second quarter of 1994, according to the Taiwan Institute of 
Economic Research. 
  The institute attributed the growth to rising foreign and 
overseas investment in Taiwan, strong export competitiveness, 
the economic recovery in the United States, and a depreciating 
NT [New Taiwan] dollar. 
  Rising investment can be seen from the 29 percent growth in 
foreign and overseas investments made in Taiwan during the first 
four months of this year. This is the first positive growth 
after two consecutive years of negative growth, and is an 
indication that foreign investors are gaining confidence in 
Taiwan's investment climate. 
  Brought up by rising interest rates and a recovering economy 
in the United States, the depreciating NT dollar is favorable 
for Taiwan's exports. Strong export trade also constitutes a 
factor in pushing up manufacturing production, the institute 
said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- The Kaohsiung-based fishing 
boats Chin Chuang Hsing and Chin Yuan Hsing were fishing 
illegally in Argentine waters before the Argentine Navy attacked 
and sank the Chin Yuan Hsing on Saturday [21 May], the Council 
of Agriculture (COA) said Monday. 
  The two owners of the two vessels will be dealt with 
according to ROC fishing laws which mandate punishment for 
illegal operation in foreign economic zones, COA Fisheries 
Department Director Li Chien-chuan said. 
  Li said that the fishing licenses for the ships may be 
suspended or revoked. 
  The owners of the ships were not available for comment on 
the 
incident, in which an Argentine Navy corvette opened fire on the 
Chin Yuan Hsing Saturday, forcing the crew to escape the sinking 
vessel in lifeboats. 
  About 110 Taiwan fishing boats are reportedly fishing for 
squid near Argentina and the Falkland Islands. Of this number, 
Li said, sixty have signed fishing agreements with the Falkland 
Islands and 13 with the Argentine Government which allow them to 
fish in territorial waters. 
  The remaining 37 squid boats have not signed the accords and 
can only fish on the high seas, he said. They are prohibited 
from fishing in Argentine or Falkland Islands territorial waters. 
  The Argentine Navy has been strictly enforcing a ban on 
illegal fishing and will continue to do so, Li added. 
  Meanwhile, a report from Buenos Aires said that the crew of 
the Chin Yuan Hsing was rescued by the Chin Chuang Hsing, which 
is still somewhere on the high seas. 
  The Chin Chuang Hsing was expected to return to Port 
Stanley, 
Falkland Islands on Saturday afternoon, but remained on the high 
seas through late Sunday. 
  A medical team has been sent to the port to await the Chin 
Chuang Hsing and treat any injured sailors, the report said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Interior Minister Wu 
Poh-hsiung Saturday [21 May] called child prostitution a "shame 
of society" and urged harsher penalties for pimps and persons 
who frequent child prostitutes. 
  Speaking during a seminar on child prostitution, Wu said 
child prostitution not only harms social morals but also 
infringes on people's human rights. 
  Wu said the Interior Ministry has recently completed a child 
prostitution prevention plan which seeks to pool the efforts of 
all sectors of society to crack down on the crime. 
  Under the plan, Wu said, the ministry will offer cash 
rewards 
for information leading to the arrest of pimps who control and 
live off the money earned by child prostitutes. 
  Chen Hui-chi, an executive at the Taipei's Women's Rescue 
Foundation, said besides imposing severe penalties on those who 
frequent child prostitutes, the names of the "Johns" should be 
publicized to help stamp out the crime. 
  Shen Mei-chen, a lawyer familiar with child prostitution 
offenses, said that the government will have to revise its laws 
if it intends to eliminate the "shame of society." 
  Shen said current laws make it difficult for police to deal 
with men who seek the services of child prostitutes. The laws 
say that the men can only be prosecuted for the offense if a 
complaint is filed. 
  Shen called for revisions to anti-prostitution laws which 
would make seeking a child prostitute a criminal offense. 
  It was estimated last year that more than 10,000 children or 
teenagers were involved in the sex industry. Of them, only some 
2,000 have been arrested by the police.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan will share its 
experience in preventing dengue fever with Southeast Asian 
countries, Environmental Protection Administration Administrator 
Chang Lung-sheng said Monday [23 May]. 
  Chang made the remarks at the opening ceremony of an 
international dengue fever control meeting which gathered more 
than 180 experts and scholars from 19 countries in Taipei. 
  Chang said the main purpose for holding the meeting was to 
invite specialists to form a new dengue fever control alliance 
in Asia to jointly combat the disease and develop programs in 
urban areas to kill mosquitoes which carry the disease. 
  The meeting will also propose that a private foundation be 
established in Taiwan to help fight dengue fever, common in 
Southeast Asia and Mainland China, Chang said. 
  Taiwan eliminated dengue fever in just three years, Chang 
said, while neighboring Southeast Asian countries continue to 
fight the spread of the disease.

  [Text] Governor Chris Patten flew to London last night 
where he will consult the government on the possible setting-up 
of an independent human rights commission in the territory. 
China has pledged to disband such a body. During the week-long 
visit, his third in five months, Mr Patten will also respond to 
fears raised recently by the British parliament's Foreign 
Affairs Committee over Hong Kong's future. 
  The row between Britain and China over a human rights 
commission peaked earlier this month when Beijing's most senior 
official in charge of the territory, Lu Ping, vowed to disband 
any such commission after 1997. The Executive Council has 
already had a broad discussion on the proposal and will make a 
final decision next month, according to the Governor. 
  While in London, Mr Patten will meet Prime Minister John 
Major, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and the minister with 
special responsibility for Hong Kong, Alastair Goodlad. He will 
once again press for UK citizenship to be granted to the wives 
and widows of British ex-servicemen and ethnic minorities living 
in the territory. 
  Meanwhile, Mr Patten has hit out at two former governors, 
Lord MacLehose and Lord Wilson, who have criticised his 
constitutional reforms for provoking confrontation with China in 
the runup to 1997. The criticisms were made during a House of 
Lords debate on Hong Kong on Wednesday [18 May] night. 
  Mr Patten accused the two men of being out of touch with 
today's Hong Kong. "What may have been suitable and appropriate 
in the 1970s, I am not sure is as appropriate in the 1990s," he 
said. "This is a community which does have political 
aspirations." He maintained his political reform had been 
endorsed by the Foreign Affairs Committee and Britain's 
political parties. 
  Mr Patten has also criticised some of the proposed 
amendments 
to the remainder of his political blueprint, which will be 
debated in the Legislative Council next month. He said they 
were contrary to the interests of the public. "We believe that 
our bill is the best one...and is in the best interests of Hong 
Kong." 
  Mr Patten said the government had not blocked independent 
legislator Emily Lau's ambitious amendment for fully direct 
elections in the Legislative Council, which was ruled out of 
order by council President John Swaine on Thursday. During his 
visit to Britain, the Governor will fulfil a number of 
engagements, including addressing a parliamentary group on Hong 
Kong and the Conservative Party's backbench committee on foreign 
affairs. He will also meet Hong Kong communities living in the 
northwest of England.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 21 (XINHUA) -- Former British 
Foreign Secretary Geoffery Howe has said that the Sino-British 
joint declaration would still play a vital role in the transfer 
of power of Hong Kong in 1997. 
  Addressing an American Chamber of Commerce lunch here Friday 
[20 May] following his recent Beijing trip, Howe also said 
China's economic progress had given some assurance to the people 
of Hong Kong about their future. 
  Meanwhile, he warned that a decision by the United States to 
revoke China's most-favored nation (MFN) trading status would 
hit Hong Kong much heavier. "Curtailment of MFN status would 
provoke China as much as a bee-sting, and damage Hong Kong as 
much as a sledgehammer," he said.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 May (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou Jiahua 
of the State Council met this afternoon at the Great Hall of the 
People with representatives of the China and Hong Kong chapters 
of the Association of Young Company Presidents who came to 
Beijing for a visit. 
  Zou Jiahua welcomed the representatives' visit. He said: 
Youth is the hope of our times. You not only are youths, but 
also company presidents. You have been doing important work in 
enterprises in Hong Kong and have played a very significant role 
in the economic development of the mainland and Hong Kong. Hong 
Kong's economic development, prosperity, and stability are 
inseparable from the mainland, and the mainland's economic 
development also needs Hong Kong's support. Therefore, it is 
very beneficial to both sides to increase economic cooperation 
and exchange between the two sides. 
  The China and Hong Kong chapters of the Association of Young 
Company Presidents are organized by the heads of large Hong Kong 
companies, the second generation of famous Hong Kong 
entrepreneurs, and accomplished young businessmen in Hong Kong. 
The association has more than 100 members. The visiting group, 
which is made up of more than 80 young company presidents and 
led by Wang Mingang and Li Dazhuang, arrived in Beijing 
yesterday afternoon. This is the first visit to Beijing by a 
group of the two chapters since they were founded. Members of 
the group hoped that, through the visit, members of the 
association will have better understanding of the mainland. 
They especially hoped association members will gain in-depth 
understanding of the mainland's situation and policies since the 
policy of reform and opening up was adopted. During their stay 
in Beijing, members will visit the State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office and hold forums with officials of the State 
Commission for Economic Restructuring, the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, and the Bank of China. 
  Zou Jiahua briefed the group on the reform of China's 
taxation system, developing the economies in China's central and 
western regions, and his recent visits to the United States and 
Canada, which members of the group had been concerned about. 
  Also attending today's meeting were Chen Ziying, deputy 
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office; Hu Deping, 
vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and 
Commerce; and persons in charge of relevant departments.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chen Ziying, 
deputy director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, said here today: All Hong Kong residents' legitimate 
rights and interests should be protected. 
  Chen Ziying made the above remarks when meeting with a 
delegation of British overseas Chinese community leaders led by 
Chiu Tien, chairman of the London Chinese Community Neighborhood 
Association. 
  Their ancestors came from Hong Kong's New Territories, and 
Chiu Tien and his party are very much concerned about Hong 
Kong's smooth transition. 
  Responding to the guests' worries, Chen Ziying said: Hong 
Kong's stability and prosperity is the most important concern 
during the transition period. After 1997, we will handle things 
in strict accordance with the Hong Kong Basic Law. He stressed: 
The principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong 
people ruling Hong Kong" will never be changed. 
  Chiu Tien and his party visited China at the invitation of 
the National People's Congress Overseas Chinese Affairs 
Committee. Some other noted figures in the overseas Chinese 
community in Britain also came, including Chen Chin-yu, Shan 
Sheng, Wen Liang-sheng, Huang Jung-fu, and Teng Han-sheng. 
Tomorrow, they will go to Sichuan to get an understanding of 
the investment environment there.

  [Text] British nuclear experts yesterday came under fire 
for their attempts to allay Hong Kong's fears of any danger from 
Daya Bay following a one-day visit to the nuclear site. A 
legislator labelled the trip a "publicity" stunt and a waste of 
time. The British experts said that Daya Bay posed no danger to 
Hong Kong, but environmental groups and legislators disagreed. 
  And Reverend Fung Chiwood, an outspoken Daya Bay critic, 
attacked the visit of the two experts as a waste of time because 
they offered no suggestions or advice to Hong Kong about the 
plant. "I feel that they are doing publicity and public 
relations in Hong Kong rather than giving advice," Rev Fung 
said. "It was a waste of time, energy and money because they 
didn't give any suggestions and only said there was no problem. 
  "What is the use of 10 monitoring stations in Hong Kong if 
we 
are not in danger? "If there were a minute accident then water 
and food could be affected and people would be affected," he 
said. 
  Chris Willby, deputy chief inspector of nuclear 
installations 
in Britain, said there was a high level of commitment to the 
plant at the moment, and that for the foreseeable future it 
would be run efficiently. "The plant is designed to high 
international standards and I gained an overall favourable 
impression," Mr Willby said. 
  "I am satisfied that if there was an emergency there is no 
doubt that Hong Kong would be told quickly, although it is 
difficult to say how much time because we have no control over 
information links in China. 
  "There is a political commitment to nuclear power in China 
so 
this plant will get the resources," he said. 
  A spokesman for Friends of the Earth said: "The point is 
that you can design a nuclear plant as safely as possible, but 
accidents still occur and you can't rule out human error. 
Telling us we are safe is not enough, and the government needs 
to demonstrate that all systems are in place if there is an 
emergency. 
  The spokesman said the contingency plan for Hong Kong was a 
concern of Friends of the Earth. At a test in August police and 
the government seemed not to know what their functions were. 
  Mr Willby stressed the need for China to maintain good 
public 
relations so people were informed of what little risk there 
really was at the plant. "No people will die from nuclear power 
plants this year and more than 600 will be killed in 
aeroplanes," he said. 
  Frances Fry, assistant director with the United Kingdom 
National Radiological Protection Board, said she was very 
pleased with the visit and was satisfied with the contingency 
plan procedures in place. "You are not in danger here but the 
import of foodstuffs from the affected area should be checked if 
there was an accident," Ms Fry said. "All parts of Hong Kong 
are sufficiently far away (from Daya Bay) so it is not possible 
to envisage a mass exodus."

<F P=106> [By Chu Tzu-ju (2575 1311 5423): "Lei Mingqiu Denies He </F>
Will Become First Commander of PLA Troops Stationed in Hong 
Kong"] 
  [Text] With the approach of 1997, the footsteps of the 
People's Liberation Army [PLA] to be stationed in Hong Kong also 
have come closer! More contact can promote understanding, and 
deepened understanding can bridge distances and reduce 
misunderstandings. 
  On 30 April, the leaders of the Guangzhou Military Region -- 
including Political Commissar Shi Yuxiao; Deputy Commanders Wang 
Shen, Zhou Yushu, and Tao Bojun; Deputy Political Commissars Gao 
Tianzheng and Liu Xinzeng; Political Department Director Lei 
Mingqiu; Chief of Staff Gong Gucheng; and Logistics Department 
Director Chen Tianlin -- gathered together to welcome guests 
from Hong Kong. 
  Deputies to the National People's Congress and members of 
the 
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference from the Hong Kong region, members of 
the Preliminary Working Committee of the Hong Kong Special 
Economic Region [SAR], and Hong Kong Affairs Advisers -- more 
than 100 people in all -- made a special trip to Guangzhou to 
visit the troops stationed in Guangzhou. This reportedly was 
the first time since the founding of the People's Republic that 
so many Hong Kong residents had visited PLA troops in an 
organized manner. 
  The Central Military Commission has begun forming the troops 
to be stationed in Hong Kong, and the specific work reportedly 
is handled by the Guangzhou Military Region. 
  It is rumored overseas that the first commander of the PLA 
troops stationed in Hong Kong will be Major General Lei Mingqiu 
(1942-), director of the Political Department of the Guangzhou 
Military Region. However, in a conversation on 30 April with Li 
Kuo-chiang, chief editor of this journal, Lei officially refuted 
the rumor, saying that there was absolutely no such possibility 
because another one would take up the post. 
  The Guangzhou Military Region administers a land area 
covering 864,000 square km, a sea area covering 2,100,000 square 
km, a population of 220 million, over 3,000 islands, and 678 km 
of land borders (principally with Vietnam). It is linked with 
the Hong Kong and Macao area in the southeast, stretching over 
the Zengmu Ansha on the Nansha Islands in the south and 
bordering on the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, and 
Indonesia. The Nanhai Fleet, one of China's three major fleets, 
is also under the command of the Guangzhou Military Region. It 
guards the southern gate of China, helps the local authorities 
stabilize the situation, and is responsible for disaster-relief 
work. 
  According to Tao Bojun, deputy commander of the Guangzhou 
Military Region, Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang 
Zemin recently issued a 10-point requirement, including: The 
Army must obey central orders absolutely; the party should 
command the Army; and the Army should unswervingly carry out the 
central line, overcome the erroneous tendency toward the 
mountain-stronghold mentality and factionalism, and obey orders 
in all their actions without slackening efforts. The Army 
should seek truth from facts, promote democracy, and conduct 
political education. Army organs should manage cadres well. It 
is necessary to strengthen work among company units, step up 
technical training, improve skills, select talented persons who 
have both ability and political integrity, and take the lead in 
carrying forward a fine work style. 
  Tao said: Having fought successively in different parts 
north and south of the Chang Jiang, the troops under the 
Guangzhou Military Region have brought forth heroes in large 
numbers. They took part in the Autumn Harvest Uprising, the 
Long March, the battle of Pingxingguan, the 100-Regiment 
Offensive, the Liaoxi-Shenyang, Peiping-Tianjin, and Huaihai 
campaigns, the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the 
battle of Xisha, and the war of self-defense against Vietnam. 
Among these troops, there are the Red First Company, which 
joined in the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927, the Heroic 
Company Crossing the Dadu He during the Long March, the Five 
Fighters of the Langya Shan during the war of resistance against 
Japanese aggression, the Heroic Regiment of Tashan during the 
Liaoxi-Shenyang campaign, the Heroic Company of Huangcaoling 
during the Korean war, and the heroic fighters of the Faka Shan 
who gave a good account of themselves in defending the territory 
of the motherland at the Sino-Vietnamese border in 1979. 
  Tao quoted Deng Xiaoping's remark, saying: "Deng Xiaoping 
said the stationing of Chinese troops in Hong Kong is a 
reflection of sovereignty and is needed to ensure Hong Kong's 
future stability and prosperity. He said: "Aside from 
stationing troops in Hong Kong, what else can reflect the 
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong?" "The stationing of 
troops in Hong Kong has another function, namely, to prevent 
turmoil. If those who want to stir up turmoil know that there 
are Chinese troops in Hong Kong, they will have to think twice! 
Even if there should be turmoil, it also can be solved 
promptly." 
  Tao quoted Article 14 of the Basic Law as saying: "The 
central people's government is to be responsible for the defense 
of the Hong Kong SAR. Military forces stationed in the Hong 
Kong SAR for defense are not to interfere in the local affairs 
of the region. When necessary, the government of the Hong Kong 
SAR may ask the central people's government for assistance from 
the garrison in the maintenance of public order and in disaster 
relief. In addition to abiding by national laws, members of the 
garrison are to abide by the laws of the Hong Kong SAR." 
  Major General Tao disclosed: The Central Military Commission 
has started making preparations for the garrison. The troops to 
be stationed in Hong Kong are being formed. The central 
authorities have set very high criteria and very strict demands 
for the selection of the troops. They must be powerful, heroic, 
and civilized. 
  Tao compared the Red First Company, a crack PLA unit with a 
glorious history, with the future garrison in the Hong Kong SAR, 
saying that the garrison will have more distinguished features 
than the Red First Company. 
  Another knowledgeable general confirmed to this journal that 
the troops to be stationed in Hong Kong are being formed. The 
officers are being selected and trained, but the soldiers have 
not been selected yet. As officers and men are transferred once 
every three years, the training of soldiers to be stationed in 
Hong Kong will be conducted later because there are still three 
years to go before 1997. The venue will be in the Guangzhou 
Military Region. In addition to the ground forces, the Navy 
also will be an important component.

  [Text] An armed Chinese marine patrol which boarded a 
cargo ship two nautical miles inside Hong Kong territorial 
waters at the weekend planned to hijack it and steal its $1 
million cargo of consumer goods, sources said last night. 
  The attack was thwarted by a Royal Navy patrol which 
identified the Chinese speedboat involved. Security Branch 
officials will decide this morning whether to go through the 
Political Adviser's office to ask mainland authorities to take 
further action. 
  The 200-tonne Chinese-registered Shanwei 039, legally 
carrying 186 air-conditioners and 60 televisions was heading 
from Victoria Harbour to its home port of Shanwei about 120 
kilometres from Hong Kong. It was intercepted by the speedboat 
due east of Sai Kung at around 10.15 pm on Saturday. 
  Four officials in Chinese uniforms and armed with AK-47s 
clambered aboard and ordered the ship's master to change course 
for a Chinese naval base on Dangan Dao, one of the Lema islands 
to the south of Hong Kong. 
  The ship's eight-strong crew had not issued a distress call. 
But Royal Navy patrol craft HMS Peacock on a routine 
anti-smuggling operation in Mirs Bay was tracking the 
speedboat's movements and moved in when it went alongside the 
cargo ship. 
  "The ship's crew were overjoyed to find out the Royal Navy 
had arrived," a source said. 
  "The crew heard the Chinese planning to lock them inside the 
foredeck, take the ship into the base and offload the cargo. 
Then they would take the ship back out to sea and release the 
crew." 
  The mainland officials abandoned the attempt when HMS 
Peacock 
lit up the scene with its searchlights and sent over a fast 
pursuit craft to find out what was going on. 
  A spokesman for the British Garrison said: "There was no 
confrontation. We informed them they were inside Hong Kong 
territorial waters. 
  They returned to their own vessel and headed back to Chinese 
waters." 
  "They were definitely Chinese officials and we are 90 
percent 
certain they were border security guards." He said they were 
wearing green uniforms. 
  Marine Eastern Waters district commander Ian Tyzzer said: "I 
really don't know what they were up to. You can look at the 
facts of the case and be suspicious but I cannot say one way or 
the other." 
  HMS Peacock commanding officer Lieutenant-Commander Sean 
Steeds called in a marine police launch at 10.47 pm to help 
investigate. The police found the cargo ship was operating 
legitimately with a full cargo manifest and a carriage licence 
from Hong Kong Customs and Excise. 
  All vessels under 250 tonnes need a licence before they can 
carry televisions and air-conditioners. 
  The Shanwei 039 was released to carry on its journey, but 
the 
ship's master asked for permission to remain in Hong Kong waters 
overnight and attempt the journey again in daylight. 
  The ship anchored off Tiu Chung Chau and eventually left 
Hong 
Kong early yesterday morning. 
  A British Garrison spokesman said it was not unusual for 
Chinese patrols to use speedboats. 
  "Like our police, they use captured (boats) to catch 
smugglers. It is difficult to tell where the boundary is, there 
is no line marked in the sea, so we can give them the benefit of 
the doubt." 
  But another source said: "That would be a lot of doubt to 
give them. They were two miles inside the boundary, and that is 
a long distance at sea." 
  The previous similar incident reported to police was the 
seizure of the cargo ship Tequila by two speedboats off Waglan 
Island on March 20. The vessel, which was legally carrying 36 
second-hand cars, was eventually found at Zhuhai.

  [Text] A senior Chinese official yesterday expressed 
optimism about the chances of reaching agreement on the 
financing of the new airport and its rail link. 
  Deputy Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office Chen Ziying was replying to reporters who had 
suggested the Government's funding request from legislators for 
$820 million for the Chek Lap Kok airport railway might damage 
the talks. 
  "Things are moving on. Why are you so pessimistic?" he said. 
  Pro-China legislator Tam Yiu-chung said he believed the 
Airport Committee meeting on Friday had made some progress. 
  He did not think the funding request would hamper future 
talks. 
  "The airport projects have started. It is no longer a matter 
of whether to build it or not. 
  "The most important thing is the size of borrowings should 
not go beyond the $5 billion ceiling as laid down in the 
Memorandum of Understanding on the airport projects," he said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Su Man (5685 2581): "Steven Poon Kwok-lim Says </F>
Problem-Solving Conditions Exist in the Sino-British Airport 
Committee Meeting"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 19 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Steven 
Poon Kwok-lim, Legislative Council [Legco] member and Hong Kong 
affairs adviser, has said: It is good thing that the 
Sino-British Airport Committee has resumed its meeting after a 
nine-month suspension. The atmosphere is now riper and less 
fraught with difficulty. We still cannot expect too much, but 
the conditions for solving problems do exist. Mr. Poon said 
that both sides can talk over the financing package, make the 
credit limit flexible, and compromise with one another on the 
procedure for granting land. He hopes that both sides do not 
stop doing these necessary things merely due to some technical 
problems. He anticipates that the upcoming meeting may discuss 
the issue of the delay in the new airport project and resultant 
nonperformance of the stipulations of the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the Airport. He proposes that efforts should 
be made to start key airport projects before 1997, so that the 
Special Administrative Regional [SAR] Government does not have 
to shoulder heavy responsibilities after the British side's 
withdrawal. 
  Poon Kwok-lim said that the first three financial packages 
proposed by the Hong Kong Government were unacceptable to the 
Chinese side, while the fourth package could be taken as the 
basis for talks. He said: The HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars] 
in loans prescribed by the Sino-British Memorandum of 
Understanding on the Airport are negotiable, and it seems that 
the Chinese side will consider it at their discretion. 
According to the principles of the fourth financing package -- 
which has been disclosed -- the Hong Kong Government is going to 
invest a total of HK$60.3 billion in two projects so that total 
borrowing will drop to HK$23 billion. This is still considered 
to be too high, but, due to the fact that the cost of key 
airport projects has dropped over HK$7 billion, HK$8 billion of 
the cost of the new airport and the airport railway may, in the 
end, be made up. In addition, as the prices of land along the 
airport railway route have been soaring over the years, doubling 
the HK$40 billion value estimated in 1991, it is possible to 
utilize these funds so that the total amount of borrowing will 
be close to HK$5 billion. As the proceeds of land sales are far 
greater than the original estimate, and the Hong Kong Government 
has a large financial surplus, it is also feasible to invest 
additional funds in the projects if necessary. In his opinion, 
Mr. Poon thinks that the Chinese side will accept the reasonable 
and flexible arrangement of the credit limit. 
  Regarding the controversial issue of airport railway land, 
Poon Kwok-lim pointed out: Naturally, the 62 hectares of land 
should be included in those annually granted by the Sino-British 
Land Committee, and the British Hong Kong side should work out 
and propose a timetable clearly listing the sites and quantities 
of land. If the Chinese side agrees to the proposal, the Land 
Committee can work on it. 
  Poon Kwok-lim also said: The longer the talks on the new 
airport financing are suspended, the greater the possibility 
that many projects will be delayed. Moreover, we should beware 
of the risk that the SAR Government will be left with a heavy 
burden of railway construction if key airport projects cannot be 
completed by 1997. Hence, he and the Liberal Party advocate that 
the Chinese side and its British counterpart should seek common 
ground while minimizing differences; that is, they should 
utilize as many usable funds as possible to start key projects 
first and then continue to discuss their differences. On the 
other hand, Legco should examine and approve the allocation of 
airport funds on the basis of reason, urgency, nonviolation of 
the Joint Declaration, and leaving no burden to the SAR 
Government.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Opinion" page: "Time To Stop Petty </F>
Bickering"] 
  [Text] The long-running saga of the airport talks has been 
a tale of woe from the beginning. And the end is nowhere in 
sight. 
  Anyone looking to the latest Joint Liaison Group's (JLG) 
Airport Committee meeting for a display of Sino-British harmony 
was bound to be bitterly disappointed...again. 
  The two sides apparently made some progress on the disposal 
of land around the airport rail link, but they haven't been able 
to solve the overall problem. 
  It was a moment that captured, in one anguished sentence, 
all 
the frustrations of a weary negotiator. 
  As he emerged from yesterday's three-hour session, British 
senior JLG representative Hugh Davies said: "I can't say we 
made as much progress as we would have liked...we are 
disappointed." 
  The sterile and fruitless wrangling between Beijing and 
London must provide a powerful sense of deja vu for all 
concerned, including the long-suffering people of this 
territory. Never have so many been so frustrated for so long by 
so much petty bickering and backbiting. 
  A glimpse into our files reveals a constant repetition of 
such words as "impasse", "deadlock", "stalemate" and 
"frustration" in news stories about the talks. 
  It would be easy to predict that the standoff will continue 
until the political row is settled. It is tempting to suggest 
that the feeling of injury in the senior Chinese leadership is 
preventing them from striking an agreement. 
  It is equally tempting to submit that -- in view of Hong 
Kong's massive annual surpluses -- the British side could reduce 
the level of debt to a point that China would have to accept. 
  But we have no wish to apportion blame. Will and vision have 
been in short supply on both sides. 
  It's time they both looked at the bigger picture, 
irrespective of their political differences. It is time to get 
on with the job. That is what the people of Hong Kong want. 
  They know that each delay costs millions of dollars. They 
are tired of watching Beijing and London locking horns and 
playing power games while this huge, complex and specialised 
project is mired down in unrelated political debate. 
  There are any number of other crucial transitional issues 
hanging in the balance: Special Administrative Region (SAR) 
passports, the question of extradition treaties, the right of 
abode in Hong Kong after 1997 and averting a legal vacuum in the 
territory after the change of sovereignty. 
  There are many laws that will have to be updated to fit in 
with the Basic Law when Hong Kong is no longer under the British 
Constitution. 
  This is crunch time. There are only three years to go. We 
must have an airport. Both sides must get their acts together 
and get on with it.

<F P=106> [By Billy Wong Wai-Yuk] </F>
  [Text] A controversial film about China's laogai or labour 
camps which Television Broadcasts (TVB) bought six months ago 
has yet to be screened, and legislators are criticising the 
delay as an act of self-censorship which betrays the rights of 
the public. The legislative councillors yesterday even 
expressed alarm over what they called increasing media 
self-censorship. 
  Pro-democracy activist Lau San-ching said he would challenge 
TVB by showing the film in public in the same way protesters 
showed another BBC film, Chairman Mao, The Last Emperor after 
TVB similarly refused to show it. 
  The movie about the laogai, filmed by BBC reporters with 
secret cameras in China's northwestern province of Xinjiang, is 
said to show footages of prisoners marching into factory 
buildings and tilling fields, and unmarked prisoners' graves in 
the desert. 
  American congressmen watched the film last week as they 
debated whether or not to renew China's Most Favoured Nation 
(MFN) trading status. 
  Legislator Emily Lau said TVB's decision not to show the 
film 
indicated an increasing self-censorship in the media. "The Mao 
film and the laogai film are just two examples. As we face the 
change-over of sovereignty, the self-censorship problem will 
increase," she said. "It is understood that media owners don't 
want to anger the mainland authorities for the sake of their 
businesses. But this trend is worrying." 
  Legislator Frederick Fung said that not screening the film 
would deprive Hong Kong people of the right to see the real 
situation in China. "If TVB thinks (the film is) too sensitive 
to show before the MFN decision, it can show it afterward," he 
said. 
  Another legislator, James To, said TVB owed the public an 
explanation for not doing so. 
  But TVB's external affairs controller Lily Chan said 
politics 
had nothing to do with the acquisition of the laogai film. 
"We've bought a lot of films from different broadcast networks 
throughout the years, but we might not necessarily put all of 
them on screen. The laogai film is just one of the documentaries 
we've bought, and we do not have a schedule for it yet," she 
said. Asked if TVB would show the film in response to public 
clamour, she replied: "We will always consider the market 
demand and the interests of audiences." 
  Lau San-ching said he would screen the laogai film publicly 
as he had done with the Mao documentary if he got hold of it. 
"I'm really angry and disappointed to hear of the repeat of 
such an act by TVB. It further indicates TVB's motivation for 
the suspension of the Mao film, that it wanted to give the 
Chinese authorities a big gift," he said.

  [Text] Macao, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Members of the 
Sino-Portuguese Working Committee on the three major issues in 
the transitional period in Macao met here today for the 12th 
time to discuss and seek effective ways for the settlement of 
these issues. 
  Han Zhaokang, Chinese representative from the 
Sino-Portuguese 
Joint Liaison Group, told reporters after the meeting that the 
Chinese Government attaches equal importance to the settlement 
of the three major issues, namely the localization of public 
servants and law, as well as officialization of Chinese 
language, stressing that all of them are equally important to 
the smooth transition and transfer of power in Macao. 
  He pointed out that no matter the localization of public 
servants or the localization of law, language is a question that 
can not be ignored. So the three issues are of equal 
importance, he added.

  [Text] Low interest rates and China's credit tightening 
caused a significant outflow of funds from Macao last year, 
according to a study by the Macao Monetary and Foreign Exchange 
Authority. 
  The authority's 1993 monetary trend analysis noted that 
"real 
negative interest rates" had driven funds from Macao's banking 
system into Hong Kong's stockmarket. And China's austerity 
measures, which affect Chinese businesses in Macao, had led to a 
liquidity squeeze. 
  Details of the unpublished report were leaked to the 
Portuguese-language weekly Comercio de Macao over the weekend. 
The report says that for the first time in many years, Macao 
recorded a balance of payments deficit last year because of a 
net outflow of capital. It also points out that bank lending 
increased by 38 percent last year over 1992, showing the 
dynamism of the enclave's service and construction sectors. A 
quarter of domestic credit last year was taken up by mortgage 
loans. 
  Banks in Macao will today raise savings-deposit and 24 hour 
call-loan rates by half a percentage point and time-deposit 
rates by 0.75 percentage points. The prime lending rate is also 
expected to rise as Macao banks usually follow Hong Kong banks 
closely. Most major Hong Kong banks put up the prime rate by 
half a percentage point to 7.25 percent. 
  Macao's banking sector comprises six local banks, 13 banks 
incorporated abroad, one off-shore bank, a post-savings bank and 
the Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority. The Bank of China 
(Group) controls more than half of Macao's banking business. 
The Macao government plans to turn the enclave into a 
sub-regional banking centre in the Pearl River delta, mainly 
serving its Chinese hinterland, which includes Zhuhai. 
  Macao's total private banking-sector assets grew 
year-on-year 
by 27 percent to 107bn patacas at the end of last year, the 
Macao Monetary and Foreign Exchange Authority announced in a 
1993 year-end report on Saturday. Domestic credit grew 38 
percent to 31.4bn patacas, while net foreign assets slipped 12 
percent to 28bn patacas. 
  M1 money supply decreased year-on-year by 1.8 percent to 
21bn 
patacas, while M2 money supply rose 7.1 percent to 54bn patacas. 
  The circulation of patacas, Macao's sole legal tender, has 
grown at an annual rate of 11.6 percent, reaching 1.08bn at the 
end of last year. The pataca, issued by Portugal's Banco 
Nacional Ultramarino at the behest of the Macao Monetary and 
Foreign Exchange Authority, is pegged to the Hong Kong dollar at 
a rate of one pataca against HK$0.97.

  [Text] Macao, May 21 (XINHUA) -- China and Portugal have 
reached a consensus on Macao's accession to the International 
Association of Lighthouse Authorities, according to sources from 
the Chinese team of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group. 
  The sources said that a formal agreement is expected to be 
signed at the 20th meeting of the Joint Liaison Group, scheduled 
to be held in Lisbon in July this year. 
  At a special working committee meeting Friday [20 May], 
representatives from both sides of the Joint Liaison Group also 
discussed Macao's accession to the United Nations Educational, 
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and both sides 
were optimistic to reach a consensus on this issue very soon. 
  The sources also said that the Chinese side has asked its 
Portuguese counterpart to give a name list of the international 
organizations, into which Macao has or wishes to join, for the 
purpose of helping smooth development of concerned work. 
  As for other issues, such as the involvement of Bank of 
China 
in issuing bank notes in Macao, preparations are going on 
smoothly and discussions on this issue are going to be held at a 
special meeting in early June.

  [Text] Manila, May 21 (XINHUA) -- President Fidel Ramos 
today reiterated the Philippine Government's support for the 
continued grant by the United States of most-favored-nation 
(MFN) status to China without attached conditions. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has to decide whether to renew 
one more year China's MFN status by June 3 this year. 
  In reiterating his support for the MFN status of China, 
President Ramos said that a healthy relationship between China 
and the U.S., particularly in the area of trade, is good for the 
peace, stability and progress of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  He said linking politics to trade can only lead to both 
sides 
losing out, adding that grant of MFN status should also not be 
selective or qualified since this could be a source of more 
friction. 
  He stressed that the trade and economic issues should be 
divorced from political concerns and that the grant of MFN 
status should not subject to political conditionalities.

<F P=106> [Article by Yueh Shan (1471 1472): "The Sino-U.S. </F>
`Agreement' on the Release of Wang Juntao"] 
  [Text] Communist China quietly "sent" Wang Juntao, a 
vanguard of the democracy movement, to the United States without 
letting the Beijing people know. He has been "released on bail 
for medical treatment" in the United States. If the people of 
Beijing were to find out about it, they would certainly find it 
strange. 
  People will at once associate this event with the question 
of 
the U.S. most-favored-nation trading status. Have human rights 
been linked with trade once again? 
  A rumor has shown that the people's guesswork has not been 
completely off the mark. During U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's visit to China in the middle of March, it was said 
that the four commitments concerning the release of Wang Juntao 
made between the Chinese and U.S. sides were as follows: 
  1. Special judicial arrangements will be made by China for 
Wang Juntao, and, after his release on bail, he will be allowed 
to go to the United States for medical treatment; 
  2. The U.S. departments concerned should undertake the 
responsibility that, during the period of receiving medical 
treatment in the United States, Wang Juntao cannot get involved 
in activities opposing the Chinese Government; 
  3. Wang Juntao will be allowed to return to China after his 
recovery; 
  4. Wang Juntao's wife Hou Xiaotian will have no difficulty 
in returning to China. 
  A cadre, a friend of mine, "leaked this secret" to me and 
told me that it was accurate information, but I think it can 
also be termed a "rumor."

  [Text] Singapore, 19 May (XINHUA) -- Singapore Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew today 
met separately with Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing. The two 
sides briefed each other and exchanged views on the Suzhou 
Industrial Park and other projects of mutual concern. 
  In the meeting with Li Lanqing, Goh Chok Tong related his 
recent trip to Germany and Britain, during which he briefed 
German and British businessmen about the Suzhou Industrial Park 
project, a Chinese-Singapore joint venture, and invited them to 
invest in China. 
  Li Lanqing expressed appreciation to the Singapore leader 
for 
making a trip to Europe to personally canvass investments for 
the Suzhou project. Li Lanqing briefed Goh about progress in 
carrying out the project. 
  In their meeting, Lee Kuan Yew and Li Lanqing held in-depth 
discussions on the project's personnel training and development 
plans. The two sides expressed satisfaction with the progress 
achieved in the project in little more than two months since the 
two governments signed the joint venture agreement.

Economic Zones; Gan Ziyu, vice minister in charge of the State 
Planning Commission; and Chinese Ambassador to Singapore Yang 
Wenchang were present at the meetings.

  [Text] Copenhagen, 17 May (XINHUA) -- On behalf of the 
Danish Government, Danish Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft 
hosted a luncheon here at noon on 17 May, in which he warmly 
welcomed Li Ruihuan, chairman of China's National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During 
the luncheon, the host and his guest delivered warm and friendly 
speeches, in which they praised Sino-Danish friendship and 
signaled their willingness to work together to further promote 
the continuous development of relations between the two 
countries. 
  Li Ruihuan said: I visited your beautiful country 11 years 
ago. Your country's quiet idyllic scenes, and your warm-hearted 
and hospitable people, produced a deep impression on me. The 
industrious people of Denmark, after several centuries of hard 
work, have built Denmark into a modern country with highly 
developed industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and tertiary 
industry. The Chinese people highly admire the achievements 
scored by the Danes. 
  He said: The Chinese and Danish peoples began friendly 
contacts several centuries ago. Denmark was one of the first 
Western nations that established diplomatic relations with New 
China. After the establishment of diplomatic relations, the two 
countries kept developing and strengthening friendly contacts 
and mutually beneficial cooperation. Over the past few years in 
particular, joint efforts by the two sides have led to more 
exchanges of visits by high-level officials, ever-deepening 
mutual understanding, and the rapid development of cooperation 
in the economic, trade, scientific, technological, educational, 
and cultural fields. 
  Li Ruihuan said: Over the past 10 years or more, China's 
achievements in economic construction have riveted the world's 
attention, with sustained growth in the national economy and 
marked improvements in people's living standards. We should 
further intensify our efforts in reform and opening up; maintain 
the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy; maintain political stability; and promote all-around 
social progress. 
  Lykketoft said: The friendship between the Chinese and 
Danish peoples dates back to ancient times. At present, trade 
between the two countries continues to grow, economic 
cooperation keeps expanding, and political contacts are 
increasing gradually. The Danish Government and the Danish 
business community are devoting great efforts to advancing 
relations between the two countries, especially to further 
developing economic relations and trade. He expressed the 
belief that Li Ruihuan's current visit would benefit contacts 
and cooperation between the two countries. 
  Lykketoft also recounted his visit to China in 1993 as head 
of a delegation. He said the Chinese people's resolve to 
realize the established goal of modernization, as well as rapid 
economic development, had produced a profound impression on 
members of the delegation. Moreover, China's efforts to 
strengthen its legal system to ensure stable economic and social 
development and its realistic approach toward political reform 
are unforgettable. He said: Denmark thinks highly of the 
positive role played by China, in its capacity as a permanent 
member of the UN Security Council, in international and regional 
affairs, and in maintaining world peace and stability.

  [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said here today that the May 19 report of 
"Human Rights Watch-Asia" and "Human Rights in China" alleging 
that there were 500 newly reported detainees from the '89 
turmoil was groundless. 
  The report alleged that there were nearly 500 newly reported 
detainees from the 1989 protests in Beijing No. 2 Prison and the 
Qinghe Reform-Through-Labor Farm in Tianjin. It claimed that 
the prisoners remain under harsh conditions and often have been 
tortured and poorly treated in jail. 
  "This is a sheer fabrication," the spokesman said in 
response 
to a request for comment. 
  The "Human Rights Watch-Asia" and "Human Rights in China" 
have a deep hostility toward China, the spokesman said, adding 
that in the past they fabricated similar rumors on the issue of 
human rights. 
  "It is out of ulterior motives that they spread such rumors 
now," the spokesman said.

  [Text] Wuhan, May 20 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, a top leader 
of China's armed forces, has called for efforts to speed up the 
modernization of China's national defence with new and high 
technology. 
  During a recent inspection of central China's Hubei 
Province, 
Liu, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that 
China's military industry must follow closely the development of 
new and high technology in the world and combine 
Chinese-developed technology with sophisticated foreign 
technology. 
  "China now places economic construction above all...so the 
defence science and technology and the military industry must 
also be subordinate to and serve the central task of economic 
construction, and do their utmost to aid the growth of local 
industries and China's economy as a whole," he told local 
officials. 
  During his stay in Hubei, Liu visited a shipyard, a cable 
company and the Donghu New and High-Tech Development Zone in the 
Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan, as well as construction sites 
for the gigantic Three Gorges project and Gezhouba 
hydro-electric power station on the Chang Jiang river.

  [Text] Hefei, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Work on expansion of a 
copper production center, top among the projects in the 
country's non-ferrous metal sector, is to start at Tongling city 
in east China's Anhui Province. 
  To cost 1.4 billion yuan, the project is joinly financed by 
Tongling Non-Ferrous Company and a firm from Hong Kong. 
  By 1996 when the plant will go into operation, Tongling is 
expected to join the country's biggest production centers in the 
field, with an output of 170,000 tons of copper, together with 
the city's current production capacity. 
  A special firm has been set up for the project, whose 
investment has focused on an overall renovation of Tongling No. 
1 Smeltery. 
  The main task is to raise its recovery rate of sulphuric 
acid 
from 70 percent to 94 percent, upgrading efficiency and reducing 
pollution. 
  The company will turn out 100,000 tons of first-class copper 
annually. It will also produce various noble metals, including 
gold and silver. 
  Tongling, located on the middle reaches of the Chang Jiang 
river, enjoys advantages such as easy communications, rich 
resources and good facilities.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Shanghai Chief Procurator Ni </F>
Hongfu by staff reporter Sun Xueyu (1327 1331 0151); date, place 
not given: "Newsletter from Shanghai": "New Problems 
Encountered in Combating Corruption -- Shanghai's Chief 
Procurator Ni Hongfu on Protection of Foreign Businessmen's 
Rights and Interests"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 25 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- Those enterprises 
on the mainland which are solely funded by foreign businessmen 
generally are private enterprises, and their assets are 
privately owned. The management personnel who work in these 
enterprises -- including the Chinese management personnel hired 
by the enterprises -- are not state work personnel who discharge 
public duties according to the law, so when they embezzle 
enterprise property their actions do not meet the important 
conditions of subject or object regarding the crime of 
corruption, as stipulated in the current criminal law, even 
though their behavior may correspond to the features of 
corruption. Therefore, in the process of judicial practice, it 
is difficult to mete out punishment on corruption charges. 
  Some investors in solely foreign-funded enterprises in 
Shanghai have called for the perfection of legislation, prompt 
handling of the embezzlement of "private" and solely owned 
enterprises' property, and protection of the legitimate rights 
and interests of investors. In light of this situation, I have 
interviewed Ni Hongfu, Shanghai's chief procurator. 
Number of Cases of Embezzlement of Enterprise Assets Increases 
[subhead] 
  According to reports, more and more foreign businessmen have 
established enterprises in Shanghai. Up to the end of last 
year, registration approvals had been granted to 6,939 
foreign-funded enterprises, of which 774 are solely funded by 
foreign businessmen, and these sole enterprises have invested 
$2.244 billion in Shanghai. At the same time foreign-funded 
enterprises were developing in Shanghai, there emerged some 
cases of law-breaking, in which some personnel who managed money 
and materials in these enterprises abused their positions to 
embezzle enterprise property. According to statistics, 
Shanghai's procuratorial organs have received 14 complaints, and 
the tendency is on the rise. 
  Ni Hongfu said that the main features of these complaints 
are: Management personnel in solely foreign-funded enterprises 
abuse their positions to steal and sell property belonging to 
enterprise owners, illegally embezzle the money and property of 
enterprise owners, transfer enterprise funds to make personal 
investments, or use enterprise funds to speculate on the stock 
market. 
Legal Protection Is Urgently Needed [subhead] 
  He said frankly that there is a question of which law is 
applicable to the handling of these embezzlement cases. These 
cases, which have emerged in enterprises solely funded by 
foreign businessmen, are new conditions and new problems 
emerging since the reform and opening up. According to Ni 
Hongfu, the current criminal law was promulgated in 1979, and 
was drafted under the highly centralized planned-economy system 
of that time, so it would be impossible to have clear 
stipulations concerning criminal activities in which internal 
personnel embezzle private property of enterprises solely funded 
by foreign businessmen. However, whether the legitimate rights 
and interests of the solely foreign-funded enterprises can be 
protected has a bearing on the legal environment for foreign 
businessmen coming to invest in Shanghai. Therefore, these 
embezzlement cases also have caused great concern in 
procuratorial organs. Not long ago, the municipal procuratorate 
and the municipal society of legal studies held a joint seminar 
on the protection of the lawful property of foreign-funded 
enterprises, and leaders from the municipality's public security 
department, procuratorate, and law courts, as well as well-known 
legal experts and scholars carried out thorough discussions on 
the application of the law to deal with this kind of 
embezzlement case. 
  He disclosed that the participants in the seminar had 
reached 
a consensus that protecting the legitimate rights and interests 
of foreign-funded enterprises is the demand of our country's 
"Constitution" and of the "Law on Protection of Foreign-Funded 
Enterprises," and that the embezzlement cases occurring in 
solely foreign-funded enterprises already have infringed on the 
lawful property ownership of citizens and foreign businessmen 
protected by law in our country, and have done obvious harm to 
society. At a time when calls are made for strengthening 
legislation and perfecting the relevant criminal rules and 
regulations, it is necessary to actively cite the crimes already 
prescribed by the current laws so as to mete out punishment. 
Regarding criminal activities that indeed cannot be punished by 
directly citing the crimes prescribed by the current laws, 
Article 79 of the Criminal Law can be cited for purposes of 
deduction so as to mete out punishment. Judicial organs must 
coordinate efforts and enthusiastically handle and investigate 
criminal activities in which personnel abuse their positions to 
embezzle the lawful property of foreign-funded enterprises. 
They must steadily, precisely, and harshly hit those who 
infringe on the rights and interests of these enterprises. 
  It Is Effective To Punish According to Criminal Law 
  Ni Hongfu briefed the reporter on the example of a case in 
which a crime prescribed by the current criminal law was cited 
to handle and crack down on embezzlement. The Minnesota Mining 
Industrial Company Limited, an American company, has established 
a solely-owned 3M Company Limited in Shanghai. Its manager 
complained that one of his employees, Zhou Yu, while serving as 
a warehouse assistant, used the method of dispatching amounts of 
goods which were larger than the amounts he recorded in the 
delivery record, thereby stealing 600,000 yuan of 
telecommunications equipment from the warehouse which he later 
sold. Initially, the public security organ thought that Zhou 
abused his position to embezzle, so the procuratorate should 
handle the case as a corruption crime, but the procuratorial 
organ thought that to have a corruption case, the stolen goods 
must be public property, whereas the 3M Company is a solely 
foreign-funded enterprise, so it was difficult to handle the 
case as a corruption crime. After the seminar on protection of 
the lawful property of foreign-funded enterprises, the public 
security organ and the procuratorial organ reached a consensus, 
according to which Zhou's behavior met the theft crime 
prescribed by the current criminal law, and the current criminal 
law can be cited directly in order to punish him. The municipal 
sub-procuratorate then prosecuted him on a charge of theft, and 
the municipal intermediate court conducted the preliminary 
hearing in late March, sentencing Zhou to death, with a two-year 
suspension. 
  In conclusion, Ni said that the procuratorial organs will 
take active measures to handle and crack down on embezzlement in 
foreign-funded enterprises, and will spare no effort to optimize 
the legal system environment and protect the legitimate rights 
and interests of foreign businessmen according to the law.

(3769 0061 1496)] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 30 Apr (XINHUA) -- During an inspection 
of the 75th China Export Commodity Trade Fair, Li Lanqing, CPC 
Central Committee Political Bureau member and State Council vice 
premier, called for efforts to further deepen foreign trade 
reforms, introduce competitive mechanisms, and make the 
Guangzhou export commodity trade fair a greater success in the 
years to come. 
  Accompanied by minister Wu Yi of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation and Guangdong Governor Zhu Senlin, Li Lanqing 
inspected the trade fair on the eve of its closing. He visited 
trading pavilions, viewed transactions, met with various trade 
delegation heads, and attended a discussion with officials in 
charge of foreign trade and economic cooperation in various 
provinces and municipalities. He also made an important speech. 
  Li Lanqing said: The latest Guangzhou export commodity trade 
fair is quite refreshing with its display of a great variety of 
commodities, which is a direct result of the introduction of 
competitive mechanisms and enhancement of competitive awareness 
by reforms in recent years. The trial implementation, since the 
beginning of this year, of compensated bidding on the 13 kinds 
of export commodities has yielded fruitful results at the trade 
fair. This major reform program, which is aimed at promoting 
fairness, has solved, to some extent, problems related to panic 
buying of high-priced goods and dumping, and should be boldly 
introduced to other commodities. In introduing more competitive 
mechanisms for the next trade fair, we should implement the 
system of "organizing trade delegations by provinces and 
municipalities, setting up pavilions by chambers of commerce, 
combining delegations with pavilions, and assigning exhibit 
arrangements to various associations of trade." In this way, we 
can bring into play the roles and advantages of provinces and 
municipalities, chambers of commerce, and associations of trade 
-- chambers of commerce in particular -- and can ensure a good 
job in setting up pavilions. This will be an effective way of 
managing the trade fair and of making things convenient for 
visiting businessmen. 
  He pointed out: This year is a crucial one for deepening 
reforms in China. We have introduced a series of major reform 
programs, and the operation of new systems has in general 
proceeded smoothly. Departments in charge of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation should make ample use of the positive 
results achieved through reform programs and should, needless to 
say, pay attention to improving any imperfections whenever 
found. They should coordinate with the relevant departments in 
taking effective measures to prevent foreign businessmen from 
using the trade fair to force China's export commodity prices 
down and domestic exporters from driving up prices unreasonably, 
thereby causing serious consequences of rising costs caused by 
foreign exchange conversion. 
  He said: We should reform foreign trade enterprises and 
should develop internationalized, industrialized, and 
comprehensive trading companies. In developing 
internationalized companies, attention must be paid to 
standardizing operations. We should continue to promote the 
reform aimed at introducing a modern system to foreign trade 
companies and should allow workers and staff of selected 
enterprises to hold a limited amount of company shares strictly 
according to the State Council's relevant regulations. 
Enterprises experimenting with this pilot project must follow 
standards and must have the approval for the pilot project. It 
is necessary to pay attention to summarizing experiences and 
correcting mistakes in good time so as to further harness the 
initiative of foreign trade enterprise workers and staff, to 
increase their cohesive power, to prevent losses of state-owned 
assets, and to maintain and increase their values, thereby 
bringing into further play the leading role and advantages of 
state-owned foreign trade enterprises. 
  Li Lanqing also discussed issues related to improvement of 
the investment environment and training of multi-purpose 
economic and trade personnel. 
  Yu Xiaosong, vice minister in charge of the State Economic 
and Trade Commission, and Qian Guanlin, director of the General 
Administration of Customs, inspected the trade fair together 
with the state commission.

  [Text] Guiyang, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Guizhou Province, the 
country's fifth-largest coal producer, will put extra efforts 
into developing its coalfields, in an attempt to spur its 
economic development. 
  The province produced 45 million tons of coal last year, one 
third of the output was sold to other southern provinces. 
  During a recent tour of Guizhou, Minister of the Coal 
Industry Wang Shenhao said coal is important for southern China, 
which is witnessing a booming economy but suffers from an acute 
shortage of raw materials and energy. 
  According to the official sources, China produced 1.14 
billion tons of coal last year. The majority were produced in 
northern China. The southern provinces, which turned out only 
300 million tons of coal last year, have to transport coal from 
the north or to import it, which worsens the transportation 
shortage. 
  Guizhou plans to build a coking plant with a capacity of 
400,000 tons, a plant with a capacity 80,000 tons of methyl 
alcohol and a power station with an installed capacity of 
800,000 kw to one million kw. In addition, a coal mine with a 
capacity of producing four million tons of coal a year will be 
developed. 
  Meanwhile, four railway lines extending from Guiyang, the 
capital, to Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Hunan provinces have 
been electrified or renovated, and a railroad for transporting 
coal from Guizhou to Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region, is under construction.

<F P=106> [Government work report delivered by Wu Liji, chairman of </F>
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regional Government, at the second 
session of the eighth regional people's congress on 20 April] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: On behalf of the autonomous 
regional people's government, I now give a government work 
report to this session for its discussion and for opinions from 
members of the autonomous regional committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and other 
persons attending as observers. 
<H5>  Review of 1993 Work </H5>
  Under the leadership of the party Central Committee, the 
State Council, and the autonomous regional party committee, the 
autonomous regional people's government, in 1993, relied on and 
led the people of various nationalities across the region to 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress, the first session of the eighth National People's 
Congress [NPC], and the sixth (enlarged) plenary session of the 
fifth autonomous regional party committee; to conscientiously 
carry out the series of major policy decisions of the central 
authorities on strengthening and improving macroeconomic 
regulation and control; to deepen reform; to open wider to the 
outside world; to work hard in unison; to overcome numerous 
difficulties; and to maintain the good trend of faster 
development in the economy of the region. Our GNP totaled 45.52 
billion yuan, up 10.6 percent from the preceding year in terms 
of comparable standards. Of this, the added value of the primary 
industry grew by 5 percent, that of the secondary industry 16.4 
percent, and that of the tertiary industry 9.7 percent. Local 
revenue totaled 5.61 billion yuan, up 43.6 percent. Judging 
from the overall situation, the major economic targets defined 
at the first session of the eighth regional people's congress 
were attained or nearly attained. Science and technology, 
education, culture, and other social undertakings made new 
headway. An excellent situation characterized by economic 
development, political stability, unity among nationalities, and 
social progress emerged region wide. 
  A. The position of agriculture and animal husbandry as the 
foundation was strengthened, and new development was achieved in 
the economies in rural and pastoral areas. Governments at all 
levels further strengthened leadership over rural and pastoral 
work and adopted a package of policy measures to support 
agricultural and animal husbandry production and protect the 
interests of peasants and herdsmen, thus effectively promoting 
the economic development in rural and pastoral areas. New 
achievements were won in building farmland and grassland 
focusing on water conservation facilities. The autonomous 
regional government attached importance to reducing the burdens 
on peasants and herdsmen and canceled 21 burdens in addition to 
the irrational burdens canceled by the state in explicit orders. 
Thanks to the improvement in the capacity for comprehensive 
agricultural and animal husbandry production and for preventing 
and combating disasters, bumper harvests were won for the 
seventh year in a row in grain production and ninth year in a 
row in animal husbandry despite the serious natural disasters in 
some localities. The region's grain output totaled 11.08 billion 
kg, an all-time record; and per capita grain share neared 500 
kg, ranking third in the country. Livestock numbered 55.777 
million in the animal husbandry fiscal year, also an all-time 
record. More trees were planted than planned to reach 390,000 
hectares, up 5.2 percent. The production of agriculture and 
animal husbandry was restructured, marking a new step in 
developing high-yield, good-quality, and high- efficient 
agriculture and animal husbandry. 
  An unprecedentedly good situation emerged in the development 
of township enterprises, which created 20.3 billion yuan in 
output value in 1993. In terms of the output value of township 
enterprises, 53 banners and counties (cities, districts) in the 
region reached 100 million yuan, an increase of 25; and 39 towns 
and townships and seven villages exceeded 100 million yuan. 
Township enterprises became a new force in Inner Mongolia's 
economic development. 
  B. We overcame numerous difficulties to increase industrial 
production and transportation gradually. Despite the strained 
funds, electricity, and means of transportation in Inner 
Mongolia's industrial production and transportation last year, 
governments at all levels strengthened the regulation, control, 
coordination, and guidance to economic operation and urged 
enterprises to deepen reform and strengthen management, 
resulting in the gradual improvement in the growth rate and 
efficiency of industrial production and transportation and the 
fulfillment of most major targets defined early last year. 
Industrial output value totaled 50.5 billion yuan in terms of 
current prices, up 12.8 percent; the sales value of the 
industrial enterprises at and above the township level totaled 
42.79 billion yuan, and the marketing rate of their products was 
95.8 percent; and the overall index of economic efficiency 
reached 75.3, up 8.5 percentage points from 1992. 
  A big 
increase was made in the output of major industrial products, 
energy resources, and raw materials products in particular. 
Output of raw coal was 51.474 billion tonnes, an increase of 
7.1 percent; power, 23.48 billion kw hours, an increase of 6.1 
percent; steel, 3.449 million tonnes, an increase of 12.1 
percent; cement, 3.572 million tonnes, an increase of 12 
percent; plate glass, 3.411 million heavy boxes, an increase of 
108.5 percent; and sulphuric acid, 82,000 tonnes, an increase of 
13.1 percent. Communication and transportation also developed 
somewhat. Rotation volume of goods transported by railways was 
54.65 billion tonnes, an increase of 6.1 percent; the rotation 
volume of passengers carried by highways was 4.34 billion 
persons per kilometer, an increase of 24.3 percent; and the 
rotation volume of passengers carried by civil airplanes was 450 
million persons per kilometer, an increase of 9.3 percent. 
Postal, telecommunications, and communications service 
developed rapidly. The total business volume of postal and 
telecommunications departments was 470 million yuan, an increase 
of 45.4 percent. Production of construction trade developed at 
a high speed. The added value realized by construction trade 
was 4.48 billion yuan, an increase of 35.5 percent. 
  Thanks to reform, reorganization, grafting, and renovation, 
new changes took place in the structures of the ownership 
system, organization, and product of enterprises on the 
industrial and communications front, and some enterprises and 
enterprise groups began to march toward the world markets. 
  C. Investment structure was readjusted and construction of 
basic industries and basic facilities developed on a priority 
basis. In 1993, the total investment in fixed assets was 21.06 
billion yuan, an increase of 41.1 percent, the largest sum in 
history. The autonomous regional government conscientiously 
implemented the central authorities' measures on macroeconomic 
control, arranged construction projects in order of importance 
and urgency, ensured the construction of key projects, and 
curbed the construction of non-key projects, thus strengthening 
the construction of key projects and ensuring the construction 
of some key projects concerning basic industries and basic 
facilities, such as energy resources, raw materials, 
transportation, and communications projects. The newly added 
installed capacity of power facilities was 616,000 kw. The 
newly added coal dressing capacity was 1.2 million tonnes. 
Construction of 10 highways, with the Hohhot-Baotou Expressway 
as the major one, started simultaneously. The tracking for 
Jining-Tongliao Railway will be completed by the first half of 
1994. Investment in the region's postal and telecommunications 
fixed assets doubled and redoubled. All of the cities at or 
above the banner and county levels automated their local 
telephone exchanges. The completion of a large number of 
backbone projects added new momentum to the economic development 
of the region. 
  D. With the establishment of the socialist market economic 
system as the objective, new headway was made in various reform 
items. New headway was made in building the socialized 
comprehensive service system in rural and pastoral areas. 
Enterprise reform was deepened continuously, greater autonomy 
was granted to enterprises, more than 95 percent of enterprises 
carried out reform of labor, employment, and distribution 
systems, and 136 enterprises experimented with the shareholding 
system. More and more small and medium-sized enterprises were 
leased, sold, and merged to others or carried out the 
shareholding cooperative system, and the vitality of these 
enterprises was strengthened. Sixty percent of state-owned 
commercial enterprises instituted the system of "being owned by 
the state but operated by the people." In some localities, 80 
percent of such enterprises carried out this system. 
  A big step was made in building the market system, and the 
role of market regulation was expanded. In the region, the 
number of country fair trade markets reached 1,511, an increase 
of 17.6 percent over the previous year. In 1993, the 
transaction volume of the country fair trade in urban and rural 
areas amounted to 4.55 billion yuan, an increase of 47.5 
percent. The number of individually run industrial and 
commercial shops reached 300,000, and these shops paid 420 
million yuan in taxes to the state. New progress was made in 
developing the markets for means of production and for key 
production factors. There were 213 markets for means of 
production throughout the region, with their total transaction 
volume reaching 1.65 billion yuan; and there were 110 markets 
for key production factors, with their business volume reaching 
300 million yuan. 
  The pace of the reforms of the social security system and 
the 
urban housing system was accelerated. A total of 5,922 
enterprises in the region carried out the old-age pension 
insurance system, and 2.857 million staff and workers joined 
this insurance system. A total of 7,471 state-owned enterprises 
joined the worker unemployment insurance system. 
Non-state-owned enterprises of various categories were also 
experimenting with the old-age pension insurance program and the 
medical insurance program. By the end of 1993, a total of 11.78 
million square meters of public houses in urban areas were sold, 
gaining 490 million yuan. 
  The pace to reform the administrative management system and 
organizations with an emphasis in the change of government 
functions was accelerated and the strength in this aspect was 
expanded. In line with the demand of letting banners and 
counties take the lead and combining the efforts of the higher 
and the lower levels, we achieved a certain success in changing 
functions, simplifying administration, delegating powers, 
streamlining staff, strictly managing the size of organs, and 
controlling the blind increase in the functionaries of 
administrative organs and establishments. 
  E. Domestic and foreign trade increased constantly and new 
strides were made in introducing investment from abroad and 
establishing lateral ties at home. The total volume of imports 
and exports during the year reached $1.2 billion, up 28.5 
percent over the previous year. The building of ports was 
strengthened and the port functions improved. Big progress was 
made in border trade, and the volume of barter trade totalled 
$770 million, up 67.2 percent, accounting for 64 percent of the 
total volume of foreign import and export trade of the whole 
region. New achievements were made in inviting business and 
introducing funds. We organized a trade fair for inviting 
business and introducing funds and for economic and trade talks 
in Hong Kong and held a foreign economic and trade fair in 
Manzhouli. During the year, we reached an agreement on 
introducing $360 million in foreign capital, up 120 percent; and 
registered 408 new foreign-funded enterprises of three types, 
exceeding the total sum of the previous years. As of the end of 
last year, our region had invested in 83 enterprises outside the 
territory. Labor service workers, 8,829 in all, were sent out 
during the year, an increase of 2,543 people over the previous 
year. We further strengthened cooperation and coordination with 
fraternal regions and the state's relevant departments and 
committees, introduced 680 million yuan of funds during the 
year, and completed 1,147 economic cooperative items and 462 
technological cooperative projects. The achievements in 
introducing funds from abroad and establishing ties at home 
instilled new vitality into our region's economic development. 
  There were abundant commodities on the urban and rural 
markets and the purchasing and marketing were brisk, giving rise 
to a prosperous scene. The total retail sales of commodities in 
society during the year reached 21.97 billion yuan, up 17.5 
percent over the previous year. Of this, the retail sales of 
consumer goods increased by 19.6 percent. The retail prices of 
commodities during the year rose by 12.5 percent, which was 
slightly lower than the national average. 
  F. Remarkable results were made in rectifying the financial 
order, and new achievements were made in financial and taxation 
work. In line with the specific demand of the central 
authorities on strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control, the financial departments "made a few simple rules to 
be observed by all concerned," and cleared up and recovered 1.25 
billion yuan in funds on random collection of funds and 
interlending loans. We tried by all possible means to absorb 
savings deposits. The year-end savings deposits of banks 
totalled 30.89 billion yuan, up 17.5 percent; and all sorts of 
loans totalled 49.2 billion yuan, up 24.5 percent, thus 
alleviating the contradiction in the shortage of funds at 
varying degrees. The financial and taxation departments at all 
levels strived to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, 
conducted general inspection of financial and taxation work, and 
cleared up and checked the problems of arbitrarily taking 
responsible for the collection of indirect taxes and 
overstepping the authority in the reduction and exemption of 
taxes. Noticeable results were made in the collection and 
management of taxes, and in the management of extrabudgetary 
funds. We collected 5.12 billion yuan in industrial and 
commercial taxes, an increase of 1.76 billion yuan, or 52.6 
percent, over the previous year. 
  G. Science and education became increasingly close to the 
economy and social undertakings further developed. Governments 
at all levels continued to place the strategy of "invigorating 
the region through science and education" high on their agenda 
and further broaden the field of making science, technology and 
education serve the economy. New achievements were made in 
popularizing scientific and technological findings, tackling 
scientific and technological problems, and implementing the 
"spark" and "torch" plans and basic studies, and 140 major 
scientific and technological items were awarded by the region. 
The pace of invigorating agriculture and animal husbandry 
through science and technology was accelerated, and about 35 
percent of the increased portion of the agricultural and animal 
husbandry output was resulted from scientific and technological 
progress. New progress was made in the introduction of 
technology, equipment replacement and technical updating, and 
the development of new products and technology in industrial and 
mining enterprises, and the output value rate of new products 
reached 25 percent. 
  Education was continuously consolidated and developed when 
quality was stressed. Education for minority nationalities was 
further strengthened. Compulsory education was steadily 
popularized. The higher educational structure was readjusted. 
Multi-layered and varied vocational and technical educational 
networks preliminarily took shape. The region generally started 
to carry out the high-standard plan for wiping out illiteracy. 
Technical training was given to nearly 20,000 peasants and 
herdsmen. The in-service training for urban staff members and 
workers was carried out in a step-by-step manner. 
  New headway was made in culture, education, public health, 
family planning, radio and television, press, and publication. 
In line with the construction of the spiritual and material 
civilizations, a group of outstanding literary and artistic 
programs and works were created and performed. New headway was 
made in building the cultural networks at four different levels 
and implementing the "rainbow culture plan." Our region won 10 
golden medals and broke two national records at the seventh 
national sports meet and also made outstanding achievements at 
such international great events as Beijing International 
Marathon, the world cup shooting event, and the world football 
championship for middle school girl students. The construction 
of the "three public health projects" in the rural and pastoral 
grass roots was strengthened. New headway was made in 
preventing and curing such endemic and infectious diseases as 
iodine-lacking diseases, fluorine poisoning, and arsenic 
poisoning. Population increase was effectively controlled. In 
1993, the region's population natural growth rate was 11.65 per 
thousand. The "five-year plan for developing radio 
undertakings" was being implemented. Radio and television 
program transmission and reception networks basically took shape 
in densely populated areas. New achievements were made in civil 
administration, religions, Mongolian language and characters, 
geology and minerals, urban and rural construction, 
environmental protection, land management, meteorological 
service, and shock and disaster absorption. 
  H: Society was stable, nationalities were united, and the 
people's livelihood was continuously improved. The governments 
at various levels persisted in the principle of "taking a 
two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough" and 
further strengthened the ideological and political work. 
Activities of commending those with contributions to promoting 
national unity and progress were extensively launched. The 
new-typed socialist nationality relations characterized by 
national equality, mutual assistance, unity, and cooperation 
were consolidated and developed. 
  The construction of the socialist democracy and legal system 
was further strengthened. The regional people's government 
conscientiously implemented the resolutions adopted by the 
regional people's congress and its standing committee, 
consciously accepted supervision, narrowed the relations with 
the regional CPPCC committee and democratic parties, and paid 
attention to soliciting opinions from all fronts in making major 
policy decisions. In the past year, the regional government 
submitted eight local rules and regulations to the regional 
people's congress standing committee for examinations and 
discussions, formulated seven regulations, and handled 674 
motions set forth by the deputies and the CPPCC members. By 
deeply implementing the "Second Five-Year Plan" for conducting 
the education on popularizing the general knowledge of laws, the 
broad masses of cadres and people further enhanced the sense of 
legal system. The overall improvement of social order was 
further intensified. Some dynamic management systems, such as 
the policeman system, were set up in a step-by-step manner. 
Achievements were made in strictly dealing blows to various 
criminal and economic criminal activities. The PLA units 
stationed in Inner Mongolia and the armed police forces made new 
contributions to safeguarding the border of the motherland, 
safeguarding social stability, supporting the economic 
construction, rushing to deal with emergency, and providing 
relief to the disaster-hit people. The unity between the army 
and the government and between the army and the people was 
further strengthened. 
  Appropriate achievements were made in opposing corruption. 
The leading cadres at or above the county and section levels 
conducted self-investigations and self-corrections. Of 212 
major and appalling cases, most were investigated and concluded 
in the order of importance and urgency. The unhealthy trends 
within trades were corrected to a certain extent. The region as 
well as leagues and cities canceled 455 items on wanton 
collection of charges. The unhealthy trends, such as going out 
of the country and the territory for trips with public funds, 
administrative organs and law enforcement departments engaging 
in business and running enterprises, and vying with one another 
to purchase imported sedan cars, were brought under control. 
  The people's living standards improved in 1993. The 
average per capita net income of peasants and herdsmen reached 
829 yuan, an increase of 110 yuan over the previous year. Of 
this, the average per capita net income of herdsmen was 1,164 
yuan, an increase of 13.9 percent, and that of peasants, 778 
yuan, an increase of 15.7 percent. If the rise in the commodity 
prices was factored in, the increase was 3 percent and 3.8 
percent respectively. The average wages of workers across the 
region reached 2,772 yuan, an increase of 19.6 percent. The 
average per capita income for living expenses of urban residents 
was 1,712 yuan, up 27.3 percent, showing an actual increase of 
11 percent after price factors were deducted. New achievements 
were made in the work of supporting the poor areas and providing 
them relief. 
  Fellow deputies, we should attribute our achievements made 
during the past year to the efforts of the people of various 
nationalities across the region to emancipate their thinking, 
advance in a pioneering spirit, and struggle in unity. On 
behalf of the regional people's government, let me extend 
heartfelt thanks to workers working on all fronts across the 
region, peasants, herdsmen, intellectuals, soldiers of the 
People's Liberation Army [PLA], public security cadres and 
policemen, and officers and men of the armed police force, 
various democratic party and nonparty patriotic personages, and 
all friends at home and abroad who have supported our region's 
modernization drive. 
  Reviewing the work of 1993, we recognized that the region's 
economic and social development situation was gratifying. 
However, there were some problems which should not be 
neglected. First, owing to the uneven economic development in 
various localities, many banners and counties had a weak 
industrial foundation and lacked avenues of increasing financial 
resources. Beside many factors of increasing expenditures, some 
localities had the problem of default in the payments for 
workers. Second, the pace to change the operational mechanism 
of enterprises was not rapid, the ability to adapt ourselves to 
market competition was not strong, and a considerable number of 
enterprises had low economic returns and suffered serious 
losses. Third, the difficulties in the shortage of power and 
funds had not been noticeably alleviated. Fourth, owing to the 
fairly big rise in the prices of the means of production, the 
increase in the actual income of peasants and herdsmen was 
affected. Fifth, the problems of formalism and bureaucracy still 
existed at varying degrees in government organs. Some cadres 
still lag far behind in emancipating the mind and renewing 
concepts. Corrupt phenomena still exist among a small number of 
functionaries. Regarding the aforementioned problems, we will 
continue to adopt positive measures to realistically solve them. 
<H5>  The Major Tasks of 1994 </H5>
  Nineteen ninety-four is an important year in which our 
region 
will continue to maintain a good trend in economic and social 
development and a crucial year for implementing all major reform 
measures issued by the central authorities and for establishing 
the socialist market economic new structure. We should take 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the 
guidance, make overall plans in line with the 20-character 
principle proposed by the Party Central Committee on "seizing 
the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability," 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the second session of 
the eighth NPC, and the eighth enlarged plenary session of the 
fifth regional party committee, accelerate the pace of 
establishing the socialist market economic structure, actively 
readjust economic structure, strive to raise economic 
efficiency, continue to maintain a sustained, rapid, and sound 
national economic development, accelerate national unity, 
guarantee stability in the border areas, promote comprehensive 
social progress, and strive to attain the two expected fighting 
objectives. 
  To fulfill the various tasks for this year, we must make 
active efforts to understand and conscientiously handle well the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability. 
Economic development is the center of all work, reform is the 
motivation to promote development, and social stability is the 
prerequisite for economic development and the smooth progress of 
reform. Genuine stability depends on development, and 
development should be accelerated by adding impetus to reform. 
Not only should we carry out reform step by step in a 
coordinated manner, but also we should refrain from being 
overcautious and miss the opportunity. We are faced with an 
important historical opportunity for reform and development. 
Inner Mongolia's economic construction and social undertakings 
will develop in a faster and still better way as long as we 
clearly understand the situation, emancipate our minds, seek 
truth from facts, work hard, fully develop our advantages, have 
a good command of the state's reform policies, discover and 
address the new conditions and new issues emerging on our way of 
advancement, and enable reform, development, and stability to 
coordinate and promote one another. 
  A. We should achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development. 
  Inner Mongolia's major targets of economic development for 
1994 are to strive for a 10 percent increase or more in GNP, 
which, translated, means a 5 percent increase in the added value 
of primary industry, a 14 percent increase in that of secondary 
industry, and an 11 percent increase or more in that of tertiary 
industry; and, dividing according to the new financial and tax 
systems, to make local revenue 3.17 billion yuan, up 14.1 
percent in terms of comparable standards. 
  a. We should develop the economies in an all-round manner in 
rural and pastoral areas with an aim to develop high-yield, 
good-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture and animal 
husbandry. Agriculture and animal husbandry, rural and pastoral 
areas, and peasants and herdsmen are always the basic issues on 
economic and social development. A success in agricultural and 
animal husbandry as well as in rural and pastoral work will play 
a decisive role in implementing the basic work principles 
defined by the central authorities for this year and in handling 
well the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability. We reaped bumper harvests in grain and animal 
husbandry production in the past few years successively, but our 
capital construction and overall disaster-control capacity are 
still at a low level, and the comparable efficiency of 
agricultural and animal husbandry production is rather poor. We 
must firmly put agriculture and animal husbandry above 
everything else and ensure the production of grain, edible oil, 
meat, sugar, and vegetables. This year, Inner Mongolia's grain 
output should be stabilized at over 10 billion kg, the number of 
livestock in the animal husbandry fiscal year should reach 56.5 
million head or more, afforested areas should exceed 330,000 
hectares, and township enterprises' output value should be 28 
billion yuan or more. 
  Investment in agriculture and animal husbandry should be 
increased at various levels, in various fields, and through 
various channels, and funds in support of agriculture should be 
used and managed well. We should continue to intensify capital 
construction for farmland and grassland, with the focus on water 
conservation facilities, pay attention to building marketable 
grain and marketable animal production bases and 
disaster-control bases for animal husbandry, and do a good job 
in building shelterbelts in north, northeast, and northwest 
China, reforesting plain areas, and improving deserts. We 
should harness large rivers in a planned manner. This year is 
the last year for Inner Mongolia's second- phase comprehensive 
agricultural development. We should accomplish the development 
tasks in good quality and quantity and, at the same time, strive 
for state's planning for the third-phase comprehensive 
agricultural development. We should step up efforts to work out 
another overall plan for "Hetao" project and actively organize 
forces to implement it step by step. 
  Aiming at developing high-yield, good-quality, and 
high-efficient agriculture and animal husbandry, we should first 
stabilize the areas sown to grain crops, stabilize their output, 
and stabilize their stock and then further adjust the production 
structure of rural and pastoral areas and the structures of 
farming and livestock breeding, greatly promote combination of 
agriculture and animal husbandry, and actively develop 
export-oriented and foreign exchange-earning agriculture and 
animal husbandry to improve the overall economic efficiency of 
agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline production. 
  We should comprehensively implement the strategy of 
invigorating agriculture and animal husbandry through science 
and education and actively promote the practice of integrating 
agriculture (animal husbandry) with science and education. 
Continued efforts should be made to implement the "bumper 
harvest plan" and popularize science and technology that are 
applicable to agriculture and animal husbandry. We should fully 
mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of technical workers 
in the agricultural and animal husbandry sectors and accelerate 
the conversion of agricultural and animal husbandry scientific 
achievements into practical productive forces. 
  Governments at all levels should uphold the principle of 
"promoting various ownerships and systems, making rational 
layout, laying stress on a proper degree of centralization, and 
developing tracts of land," proceed from the reality of all 
localities, adopt effective measures, firmly grasp township 
enterprises, and develop and expand the economy of banners and 
counties. We should encourage and guide township enterprises to 
promote the shareholding cooperative system and develop flexible 
mechanisms for township enterprises; encourage and guide them to 
cooperate with large and medium-sized enterprises, scientific 
research units, and institutions of higher learning, adopt high 
and new technology, and actively develop products with a high 
starting point, high added value, and a high ratio of products 
in the market; and encourage and guide them transform themselves 
by grafting with foreign-funded enterprises and enable their 
products to enter the international market. 
  It is necessary to conduct region-wide emulations on 
creating 
"townships and towns whose township enterprises have an output 
value of 100 million yuan, villages whose township enterprises 
have an output value of 10 million yuan, and enterprises whose 
output value reach 5 million yuan," and promote township 
enterprises to raise operational scale and management level. 
  We should resolutely implement central and regional policies 
and stipulations on reducing the burdens of peasants and 
herdsmen and check the unwarranted pooling of funds and 
arbitrary collection of donations, fees, and fines. Continued 
efforts should be made to adopt methods to support the poor 
areas develop production and use science and technology, to 
support the counterparts, to exchange cadres, and to accelerate 
the pace of helping poverty-stricken areas, particularly old 
revolutionary bases, minority areas, and border areas shake off 
poverty and become rich. 
  b. We should regard raising economic efficiency as the 
central task and promote a sustained, rapid and sound 
development in industrial and communications production. This 
year, the added value of industry of the whole region should 
reach 13.15 billion yuan, (based on the constant prices of 
1990), up 13 percent over last year. To grasp industrial 
production well, we must particularly stress the enhancement of 
economic returns, and exert strenuous efforts to serve the 
market, optimize the structure, and strengthen management. The 
comprehensive index of economic efficiency of industrial 
enterprises at and above the township level exercising 
independent accounting should rise by more than 6 percentage 
point. 
  To develop industrial production, we should try by all 
possible means to invigorate large and medium-sized enterprises 
and give full play to the overall economic advantages of large 
and medium-sized cities. It is necessary to continuously grasp 
the production of basic industries and pillar industries, such 
as coal, electricity, metallurgy, petrochemical industry, and 
building materials. Meanwhile, we should also actively attend to 
the transformation and improvement of light industrial 
enterprises with the advantages of agricultural and animal 
husbandry resources of our region, such as the woolen textile, 
leather, carpet, foodstuff, sugar, and medicines enterprises, 
and grasp new industries, including the rare-earth and 
electronics industries. The readjustment of product mix should 
be guided by the market, and the updating and upgrading of 
products should be accelerated. This year, we should develop 
1,100 new products, with an emphasis in cultivating a batch of 
products which have competitive ability on the domestic and 
foreign markets. 
  It is necessary to expand strength in developing enterprise 
technology and transformation and march towards the goal of 
rationalizing the technical installation, adopting advanced 
methods and technology, and producing high-grade new products. 
Under the plan, 4.6 million yuan will be arranged for 
technological transformation in the whole region and society, 
2.8 billion yuan of which will be diverted to state-owned units. 
We should concentrate the use of funds on some important 
projects, give consideration to general projects, pay attention 
to efficiency, and concentrate efforts on helping a batch of key 
enterprises carry out technological transformation projects and 
items that require a short construction period but yield quick 
returns and high efficiency within a short period of time. 
Further efforts should be made to introduce technology and 
actively encourage the use of foreign capital to transform old 
enterprises through such forms as developing joint ventures and 
grafting them with other enterprises. 
  We should continue to intensify the management of the basic 
work and guide enterprises to turn their eyes inward and to work 
hard to enhance their internal strength. We should deeply 
launch the activities of increasing revenues and reducing 
expenditures and of increasing production and practicing 
economy, strive to reduce production cost, upgrade the quality 
of products, increase the varieties of products, intensify 
marketing work, and positively pioneer markets. We should 
reduce the amount of goods kept in stock to promote sales, 
achieve coordination between production and marketing, reduce 
the amount of finished products kept in stock, and try every 
possible means to enliven capital. It is necessary to 
realistically ensure the safety in production, positively remove 
hidden perils, and reduce the occurrences of accidents. We 
should grasp the setup of the enterprise leading bodies and the 
enterprise staff and worker contingent; and cultivate a 
contingent of entrepreneurs who know economics, are good at 
management, and have the spirit of forging ahead as well as a 
contingent of good-quality staff members and workers with the 
ability to tackle difficult problems. 
  We should pay firm attention to helping enterprises halt 
deficits and increase profits, set up a system of each level 
assuming responsibility for fulfilling its assigned targets, 
give different instructions to different enterprises, and make 
conscientious efforts to make real achievements. We should 
strive to reduce the number of money-losing state-owned 
industrial enterprises by two to three percentage points by the 
end of this year and reduce the amount of deficits by more than 
5 percent. We should strengthen the management and coordination 
of industrial and communications production and operation, 
positively help enterprises solve transportation and capital 
problems cropping up in the course of production and 
circulation, and promote the sound development of industrial 
production. 
  c. We should maintain a reasonable scale of investment with 
the focus on basic industries and infrastructural facilities. 
This year, our region arranged 20.25 billion yuan of investment 
in fixed assets. According to the principle of "ensuring key 
projects, continued projects, and winding-up projects," we 
should concentrate energy on the development of such basic 
industries as agriculture, animal husbandry, and coal, 
electricity, metallurgical, petrochemical, building material, 
wool spinning, and forest industries as well as the construction 
of railway, highway, and postal and telecommunications 
infrastructural facilities; pay particular attention to 
continuing and winding up the ongoing projects; and strive to 
have these projects start operation and see real results as 
early as possible. We should positively strive to have the 
state make more investment in the region's key projects and 
particularly gain the policy-lending credits from the 
development banks. Simultaneously, we should adopt various 
forms, such as issuing stocks and bonds and bringing in foreign 
capital, to collect funds for key projects. We should 
strengthen geological prospecting work and better serve the 
economic development. We should pay attention to reasonably 
developing and protecting natural resources so as to safeguard 
the ecological balance. 
  d. We should take giving free rein to the development of the 
nonstate sectors of the economy as a favorable opportunity to 
positively cultivate new economic growth points. Nonstate 
sectors of the economy are key component parts of the national 
economy, as well as one of the key sources to increase tax 
revenues. At the time of grasping the state sector of the 
economy, particularly state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises, we must emancipate the mind, give free rein, and 
vigorously develop such nonstate sectors of the economy as 
collective, individual, private, and three types of 
foreign-funded ones. The proportions of various ownerships are 
allowed to be different in different localities and different 
trades. There should be no restrictions on proportions, scale, 
and management forms. It is necessary to break the bounds of 
different ownerships and to attain the requirements for state 
ownership and nongovernment management and for nongovernment 
ownership and nongovernment management. Nonstate-owned 
enterprises and individuals are allowed to lease and purchase 
state-owned small and medium-sized enterprises. Nonstate-owned 
enterprises and state- owned enterprises are encouraged for 
joint management in the forms of buying shares and offering 
technologies and equipment. Nonstate- owned enterprises' legal 
management rights and interests should be protected according to 
laws. Simultaneously, we should strengthen management and 
supervision and guide nonstate-owned enterprise managers to 
observe management laws and pay taxes according to regulations. 
  e. We should make a breakthrough in introducing foreign 
capital and advanced technologies and equipment on a large scale 
and developing large-scale cooperation and further expand the 
scale of opening to the outside world and developing lateral 
cooperation. This year, our region should make bigger strides in 
expanding the scale of exports, inviting merchants, and 
introducing foreign capital. The import and export trade volume 
should strive to reach $1.4 billion, an increase of 16.7 
percent. We should fully use our region's favorable conditions 
of opening the border areas to the outside world to further 
develop border trade and to widen and deepen the economic and 
technological cooperation with the Russian Federation and the 
Mongolian state. 
  We should exert strenuous efforts to grasp 
spot exchange trade, try by all possible means to increase 
foreign exchange through export, implement the strategy of 
occupying the market by producing quality products and 
developing various kinds of markets, develop production bases 
that can create foreign exchange through export, competitive 
products that can earn much foreign exchange, and large amount 
of key products, actively develop international markets, 
strengthen management over foreign- funded projects, enhance the 
rate of honoring contracts, the rate of putting foreign capital 
in place, and the rate of initiating new projects, strenuously 
develop tourist industry, and increase foreign exchange. 
  Further efforts should be made to strengthen lateral 
economic 
cooperation with fraternal province, cities, and regions, 
unceasingly expand economic cooperation with the northeast 
economic zone, economic zone Around Bohai Sea, Huanghe economic 
coordination zone, and other coastal provinces, cities, and 
regions, strengthen relations with Beijing Municipality and 
Hebei Province to support the counterparts, and on the basis of 
our region's advantages of having "highways, coal, electricity, 
and outlets," induce fraternal provinces, cities, and regions to 
make investments in our region, run plants, develop natural 
resources, and export products by way of our region. We should 
encourage enterprises inside the region to join the 
trans-provincial and trans-regional large enterprise groups, 
encourage enterprises outside the region to graft with 
enterprises inside the region or to develop joint ventures, do a 
good job in running the two experimental zones in Hulun Buir 
League and Wuhai city and the economic and technological 
development zones approved by the state and the region, and give 
play to their exemplary and influential role in opening up to 
the outside world. It is necessary to strengthen the work of 
setting up government organs in other localities and render good 
service while introducing technology from abroad and developing 
lateral ties at home. 
  f. We should give priority to increasing revenue and 
reducing 
expenditures and strengthen financial, taxation, and banking 
work. Governments at all levels should try by all possible means 
to cultivate financial resources and increase revenue. It is 
necessary to strengthen collection and management of tax 
revenue, strictly enforce the "tax collection and management 
method," deal strict blows to law-breaking acts of tax evasion 
and resistance, and promptly collect all the taxes which should 
be collected in full. Efforts should be made to strictly control 
expenditures. The total financial expenses must not exceed the 
budget. In line with the principle of paying attention first to 
food and second to development, making unified planning with due 
consideration for all concerned, guaranteeing the priorities, 
and curtailing general ones, we should guarantee that the wages 
of workers, particularly the teachers, retired cadres, and 
public security, procuratorial, and judicial personnel, will be 
issued on time, and guarantee the normal operation of party and 
government organs as well as institutions and units and the 
normal development of social undertakings. Continued efforts 
should be made to promote the glorious tradition of plain living 
and hard work, stop all sorts of extravagance and waste, pay 
special attention to strictly controlling the building of office 
buildings, auditoriums, and hotels, and actively curtail 
expenditure on the people, cars, and meetings. We should 
continue to control institutional purchases and strictly forbid 
the use of funds for tour abroad. We should combine the use of 
revenues inside or outside the budget and do a good job in 
managing and using funds not covered by the budget. It is 
necessary to strengthen auditing work. All localities, 
departments, and units must strictly implement the unified 
stipulations of the region, and allow no arbitrary increase in 
subsidies under any reason. 
  Financial departments should actively attract savings 
deposits from society, actively strive for state support, 
extensively absorb domestic and foreign funds, and try by all 
possible means to alleviate the shortage of funds. We should 
guarantee the priorities and give simultaneous consideration to 
general ones. It is necessary to optimize the credit structure, 
accelerate the circulation of funds, and enhance the results of 
using funds. Insurance business should be actively developed and 
its role should be given fuller play in economic construction 
and social life. 
  g. We should further invigorate the circulation of 
commodities on the basis of cultivating markets. This year, 
while making continued efforts to develop the consumer goods 
markets, we should give priority to cultivating and developing 
the wholesale markets for the means of production and the 
markets of the essential means of production, including the 
labor, personnel, banking, real estate, technology, information, 
and the property right trading markets. 
  We should greatly 
develop regional trade markets; build in the areas where 
northeast, north, and northwest China meet and in communications 
hubs a number of wholesale markets for staple farm and animal 
products and means of production, which link urban areas with 
rural areas, production units with marketing units, and Inner 
Mongolia with other provinces and which can exert greater 
influence; and gradually establish a number of distribution 
centers with Inner Mongolia's characteristics for grain, leather 
goods, woolen textiles, meat, medicinal herbs, timber, coal, 
iron and steel, building materials, and chemicals. We should 
continue to develop the role of commercial departments and 
supply and marketing departments as the major channels for the 
purchases and marketing of grain, edible oil, farm and animal 
products, and means of production. We should eliminate the 
barriers between different regions and different departments and 
the monopoly of trades and establish a new pattern of 
large-scale market, large- scale economic relations and trade, 
and large-scale circulation. While opening markets, we should 
manage markets well according to law and resolutely crack down 
on the production and sales of fake and inferior commodities to 
protect the legal rights and interests of consumers. As 
commodity prices constitute an issue concerning social stability 
and the smooth progress of reform in various fields, we should 
conscientiously do a good job in supervising and controlling 
prices. The state demands that this year's retail price rise be 
kept within 10 percent. To achieve this control target, tasks 
remain arduous. Governments at all levels must attach great 
importance to it. They should mobilize forces from entire 
society and adopt comprehensive measures to strengthen the 
supervision and control over the prices of people's basic daily 
necessities and basic service charges and strictly prevent the 
prices of important means of production from increasing. In 
addition to the price adjustments made by the state, Inner 
Mongolia will not make new price adjustments this year. We 
should establish and improve necessary reserve system and risk 
fund system for the important commodities that concern national 
economy and people's livelihood and ensure their supplies to 
stabilize the market. 
  h. We should continue to improve living standard on the 
premise of economic development. It is an important duty for 
governments at all levels to develop the economy and 
continuously improve people's material and cultural life. On 
the basis that the economies in rural and pastoral areas are 
developed in an all-round manner, we should increase the per 
capita net income of peasants and herdsmen by 100 yuan again 
this year. On the premise that economic efficiency is improved, 
we should also improve the income of enterprise staff and 
workers. The new wage system will be applied to the staff and 
workers of administrative units and institutions in line with 
the arrangements of the state and the region. Holding the 
responsibilities assigned them and taking all factors into 
consideration, governments at all levels should ensure 
accomplishment of this work. As many major reform measures will 
be carried out this year and many new conditions and new issues 
will arise, we should firmly embrace the mass viewpoint and show 
concern for people's life. We should make it a system for city 
mayors to hold the responsibility for the "vegetable basket" 
project to ensure the production and supplies of major nonstaple 
food in urban areas. We should make good arrangements for the 
life of the people of poverty-stricken areas and the staff and 
workers of difficult enterprises, especially those of the 
enterprises that have suspended production totally or partly or 
have gone bankrupt. We should do a good job in civil affairs, 
the special care to disabled servicemen and family members of 
revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, and various social welfare. 
  B. We should concentrate efforts to tackle difficulties in 
reform. 
  This year is a crucial year for promoting the package reform 
and making breakthroughs in key areas. The state has formulated 
and implemented a series of major reform measures for financial 
and tax, banking, planning, investment, and foreign trade 
systems as well as state-owned enterprises, making the reform 
unprecedented in range, quality, and difficulty. We should have 
a full understanding of the importance, urgency, and arduousness 
of this year's reform, meticulously organize its implementation, 
and achieve success in tackling difficulties. 
  a. We should establish and improve the socialized service 
system and deepen the reform in rural and pastoral areas. On the 
basis that the household-based output-related contract 
responsibility system and the dual management system combining 
unified operation with independent operation are further 
stabilized and improved, we should improve the efficiency of 
scale of agricultural and animal husbandry production, gradually 
expand the collective economy, and establish as soon as possible 
an economic operation mechanism and management system in rural 
and pastoral areas that meet the needs of the socialist market 
economy. Regarding the establishment of the socialized 
multi-purpose service system as the major target, we should 
greatly develop the economy characterized by the combination of 
farming, livestock breeding, and processing and the integrated 
management of foreign trade, industry, and agriculture (animal 
husbandry) and link the independent operation of thousands of 
households to the integrated large-scale market. Grass-roots 
multi-purpose service organizations should strive to improve 
service and gradually turn themselves into economic entities, 
which organize production and business and lead peasants and 
herdsmen to prosperity. We should conscientiously strengthen 
the grass-roots political power in rural and pastoral areas. 
  b. Enterprises should speed up transformation of the 
operating mechanism and do a good job in the reform of the 
property right system. The focuses of enterprise reform are 1) 
to invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and 
2) to transform small, poor, and loss-making enterprises. We 
should continue to enforce the "enterprise law" and the 
"regulations on transforming the operating mechanism of the 
industrial enterprises owned by the whole people," continue to 
deepen the reform of the labor, personnel, and distribution 
systems of enterprises, and establish an effective incentive 
mechanism within enterprises to invigorate them. We should do a 
good job in making an inventory and check of the stockpiles and 
capital of enterprises and assessing their property and actively 
probe the various forms of management of state-owned property. 
Enterprise reform must be proceeded from reality, different 
guidance should be given to different enterprises, and reform 
should be conducted step by step, but the key is to improve 
economic efficiency. In compliance with the requirement for 
establishing a modern enterprise system, large and medium-sized 
enterprises should organize limited liability companies or 
limited liability stock companies in an active and orderly 
manner. Seventy large and medium-sized enterprises with good 
leading bodies, good mechanisms, and good efficiency (including 
state pilot enterprises) will be selected throughout the region 
to experiment with the modern enterprise system, and reform of 
the property right system should be conducted across the board 
in small enterprises. We should concentrate efforts on 
transforming a number of enterprises in line with the 
shareholding cooperation system, transplanting foreign capital 
to a number of enterprises, expanding a number of enterprise 
groups, transforming a number of enterprises into ones 
instituting several systems simultaneously, and adjusting a 
number of enterprises by contracting, leasing, and selling them 
out or merging them with others. 
  c. We should conscientiously conduct the reform of the 
financial and tax, banking, planning, investment, and foreign 
trade systems to suit the needs of the market economy. In 
reforming the financial and tax systems, we should rationally 
divide work and financial powers between the region and various 
leagues and cities, not only taking the interests of various 
localities into consideration to boost their enthusiasm for 
economic development but also centralizing financial resources 
on the region to enhance its financial regulating and control 
capacity. We should accomplish the tax reform tasks in an 
orderly manner and achieve success in establishing central and 
local tax organizations. In the reform of the banking system, 
we should handle well the relationship between policy-lending 
business and commercial-lending business and attach particular 
importance to policy-lending business. While putting total 
amount of assets under state control, we should carry out 
management of the liabilities and risks of assets and apply the 
market mechanism more to the management of banks. We should 
actively develop the monetary organizations other than banks and 
various money markets in minority areas to expand the channels 
for money lending. The focus of the reform of the planning 
system is to develop the macroeconomic, strategic, and policy 
functions of plans, study and map out medium- and long-term 
plans for economic and social development and local industrial 
policies, and strengthen the tracking, analysis, supervision, 
inspection, balance, and coordination of economic operation. In 
the reform of the investment system, we should strengthen the 
scientific appraisal and policy making on important projects, 
clarify the major investors, standardize investment activities, 
and establish the responsibility system for investment risks and 
the system for intermediary organizations to supervise and 
manage projects. Reform of the foreign trade system should be 
focused on transforming the operating mechanism of enterprises, 
establishing as soon as possible an economic operation mechanism 
for foreign trade that conforms to international practice and 
regulations, and promote foreign trade enterprises' endeavors to 
engage in manufacturing as well as trade, form groups with other 
enterprises, and become international corporations. 
  d. We should accelerate the pace of organizational reform 
and actually change the functions of the government. In line 
with the principles of changing functions, rationalizing 
relations, reducing the number of staff, streamlining 
administrative procedures, and improving efficiency, the 
government organizational reform should be aimed at 
strengthening macroeconomic controlling and law enforcement 
supervisory departments, intensifying social management 
functional departments, and reducing specialized economic 
management organs. This year, the region's organizational 
reform should be carried out in an all-round way. In close 
combination with the building of the socialist comprehensive 
service system in rural and pastoral areas, the organizational 
reform of banners, counties, townships, towns, and sumus should 
be aimed at streamlining the superstructure, strengthening the 
grass-roots units, and mobilizing cadres as well as scientific 
and technological personnel to go to various kinds of service 
organizations to fully display their wisdom and intelligence. 
Efforts should be made to complete the organizational reform of 
the organs directly under the regional authorities and the 
reform of the organizations at the league and city levels by the 
end of this year. Governments at all levels should adopt 
effective measures to strictly control administrative 
establishment and guarantee the quality of working personnel. At 
the same time, a part of government cadres should be allowed to 
go to grass-roots areas to do business or run enterprises in 
order to make good preparations for carrying out the public 
servant system. 
  In changing the functions of government, we should 
persistently separate government administration from enterprise 
management, delegate the production management power to 
enterprises, and transfer the market regulation function to the 
markets. The government should conscientiously conduct 
macroeconomic control, comprehensive coordination, and social 
management, and should establish a strict, scientific, 
efficient, and orderly mechanism of administration. The 
government should establish and perfect the macroeconomic 
control system, make a clear distinction between the functions 
and duties of governments at all levels, successfully combine 
immediate interest with long-term interest and combine partial 
interest with overall interest, achieve a balance between total 
supply and total demand, and pay attention to comprehensive 
coordination in order to truly decontrol and enliven the 
microeconomy and successfully control the macroeconomy. 
  e. We should accelerate the establishment of social security 
system and press forward the reform in all fields. Since reform 
is a complicated systems engineering, we need the coordinated 
actions of all fields. This year, an even bigger step should be 
taken in the subsidiary reform. We should firmly grasp the 
building of social security system and accelerate the 
establishment of multi- level social security system. We should 
expand the coverage of workers' old-age pension insurance 
system, gradually realize the overall planning by the regional 
authorities, and conscientiously carry out the "methods on 
unemployment insurance for staff and workers," formulated by the 
region. The region's program on medical treatment system should 
be set forth by the end of this year. The urban housing system 
reform should be pressed forward continuously according to the 
pertinent policies of the state. 
  C. We should energetically develop various social 
undertakings. 
  In the course of grasping economic construction, governments 
at all levels should conscientiously grasp scientific, 
technological, educational, cultural, and other social 
undertakings in order to make economic construction and social 
undertakings develop in coordination. 
  a. We should accelerate the process of merging science and 
technology to the economy. This year, we should make a 
breakthrough in the fields of deepening the reform of scientific 
and technological system, vigorously translating scientific and 
technological research results into productive forces, and 
improving investment returns. In line with the principles of 
"stabilizing a point, and decontrolling a vast area," we should 
accelerate the organizational structure readjustment of 
scientific research institutes, and encourage even more 
scientific and technological personnel to engage in 
technological development, production management, and scientific 
and technological service. Development- oriented and 
service-oriented scientific research institutes should be guided 
to enter the markets, to integrate themselves with enterprises 
in diverse forms, or to initiate science- and 
technology-oriented enterprises. Encouragement should be given 
to develop nongovernmental scientific and technological 
entities. Technology markets should be cultivated positively, 
and scientific and technological rules and regulations should be 
established further with a view to protecting the property right 
of knowledge. At the same time, we should emphatically support 
the research of the basic scientific and technologies items 
promising bright prospects and provide technological reserve for 
the region's economic development in order to maintain the 
momentum of scientific and technological development. 
  The 
development and application of science and technology should be 
focused on implementation of the "spark," "torch," and "bumper 
harvest" plans, and emphasis should be placed on the development 
of high-yield, good-quality, and high- efficient agriculture and 
animal husbandry and on tackling the key scientific and 
technological difficulties in the technical transformation of 
enterprises. We should further adjust the investment pattern 
and establish and improve the system of multi- channel and 
multi-layered social investment in science and technology. 
Scientific and technical funds must be used in key areas, and 
attention should be given to efficiency. Those who use the 
funds should pay them back so that the funds can be used over 
and over again. 
  b. We should actively develop education. Governments at all 
levels should consider education a strategic priority and 
continue to implement the "outlines for China's educational 
reform and development." We should further deepen the reform of 
the education system, optimize the education structure, and 
improve education quality and the efficiency of running schools. 
Schools should conscientiously implement the principle of 
comprehensive moral, intellectual, and physical development and 
train personnel of various specialties urgently needed in the 
socialist market economy. While ensuring state investment in 
education, we should raise education funds from various 
channels, advocate various measures for running schools, and 
change the wanton collection of fees for compulsory education 
and the state's monopoly of higher education. We should collect 
extra education funds fully and use them well in line with the 
regulations of the State Council document no. 2 of 1994. We 
should regard it as a strategic goal to make the nine-year 
compulsory education universal in most areas and eliminate 
illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, pay close 
attention to it, and achieve success in it. We should be 
determined to change the tendency of lop-sided pursuit of higher 
rate of attendance of higher-level schools and turn the 
education for the purpose taking examinations into high-quality 
education. We should mobilize forces from the entire society to 
make the "hope project" successful and adopt measures to prevent 
primary and middle school dropouts. We should further improve 
secondary specialized schools and vocational and technical 
schools and conduct on-the-job training for staff members and 
workers and technical training for peasants and herdsmen. 
Schools of higher learning should accelerate their reform to 
further break with the closed way of running school. Based on 
Inner Mongolia's actual conditions in economic and social 
development and the requirement for establishing the socialist 
market economy system, we should actively adjust the layout and 
disciplines of schools and advocate cooperation in running 
schools. We should support Neimenggu University's entry into the 
"211" project. We should intensify the education of minority 
nationalities and accelerate the training and improvement of 
scientific and technical personnel, economic personnel, and 
cadres of minority nationalities. We should conscientiously 
implement the "teachers law," strive to raise the quality of 
teachers, safeguard their legal rights and interests, and 
improve their material benefits. We should make active efforts 
to train and use personnel, establish a social environment for 
respecting knowledge and cherishing talents, and stabilize and 
attract personnel. 
  c. We should make socialist culture more flourish. In 
cultural work, we should continue the orientation of "serving 
socialism and serving the people" and the principle of "letting 
a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought 
contend," put social benefit above everything else, and strive 
for unity between social benefit and economic efficiency. 
Literary and art works should advocate the main theme of this 
era and be diversified. We should lead and organize the large 
number of literary and art workers to plunge into the thick of 
reform, opening up, and economic construction, acquire a better 
understanding of the pulse of this era, and create the 
outstanding works that reflect the characteristics of our 
nationalities and region and are loved by the masses to satisfy 
the ever growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people of 
various nationalities. We should actively promote the 
restructuring of art performing groups. We should further 
develop the fine tradition of serving grass-roots levels 
displayed by the Inner Mongolia revolutionary cultural troupe. 
We should continue carrying out the "rainbow cultural plan" and 
facilitate the construction of the border cultural long 
corridor. We should step up construction of the final-phase 
work of the satellite uplink station, ground stations, and relay 
stations to expand our radio and television coverage. We should 
adhere to the principle of "making culture flourish and 
eliminating pornography simultaneously," conscientiously 
strengthen the management and supervision of cultural markets, 
and let healthy and progressive cultural activities prevail in 
urban and rural cultural fronts. We should strengthen the 
protection and use of cultural relics and resolutely crack down 
on the criminal activities to resell and damage cultural relics. 
  d. We should conscientiously carry out public health and 
sports work. Continued efforts should be made to conduct the 
experiment of reforming the medical insurance system in selected 
units in cities and towns and develop the security system with 
cooperative health care as the main substance in rural and 
pastoral areas. It is necessary to place the emphasis of health 
work in the rural and pastoral areas, grasp the building of 
health care networks in banners and counties, in sumu and 
townships, and in gacha and villages, and conscientiously 
implement measures for preventing epidemic disease and 
infectious disease that may cause great harms to the masses of 
people. We should actively conduct patriotic public health 
campaign and improve the environment and sanitation of cities, 
towns as well as the rural and pastoral areas. All medical 
units should focus their work on raising service quality, deepen 
internal reform, rectify medical order, and improve professional 
ethics and work style of medical workers. Active efforts should 
be made to explore a new way for developing sports undertakings 
during the new period, make sports a social undertaking, and do 
a good job in conducting the experiment of linking sports 
undertakings with enterprises in some selected units. We should 
extensively conduct mass sports undertakings in an effort to 
improve people's physique. In sports work, we should train 
athletes in an effort to produce professionals and achievements 
and make preparations for attending the "eighth national sports 
meet." 
  e. We should realistically grasp family planning well. It is 
necessary to conscientiously implement the work principle of 
"grasping family planning work firmly and well and paying 
attention to both," further enhance the consciousness on 
population and the per capita sense, implement the system of 
making party and government top leaders personally grasp and 
assume full responsibility for managing family planning work and 
attaining a certain target, implement the method of "negating 
one's work achievements when he violates the family planning 
plan," and ensure that the natural population growth rate will 
be controlled within 13.3 per thousand. Conscientiously efforts 
should be made to ensure healthy births and good upbringing so 
as to enhance the population quality. We should place the 
emphasis of family planning work on the rural areas and 
transients, guarantee that the family planning working funds 
will be in place, and do a good job in installing family 
planning personnel in the grass roots. 
  f. We should attend to environment protection and urban 
construction and management. It is necessary to uphold the 
principle of simultaneously planning, implementing, and 
developing the economy, urban and rural areas, and environmental 
protection work, conscientiously attend to the work of improving 
the existing pollution sources, and actively popularize new 
technology to comprehensive use the "three industrial wastes." 
We should strengthen urban construction planning work, attend 
to the building of infrastructure facilities, strengthen city 
management, and provide a good environment for a coordinated 
economic and social development. 
  D. We should further strengthen socialist democracy and the 
legal system. 
  Socialist democracy and the legal system is an important 
aspect in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and an 
important guarantee for deepening reform, promoting development, 
and safeguarding social stability. Governments at all levels 
should pay full attention to it and grasp it with earnest 
efforts. 
  a. We should continue to strengthen socialist democracy. 
Governments at all levels should maintain close ties with the 
masses, give full play to democracy, consciously accept legal 
and work supervision from the people's congresses and their 
standing committees of the corresponding level, and give further 
play to the role of political consultation, democratic 
supervision, and political participation and discussion of the 
CPPCC, various democratic parties, and nonparty patriotic 
personages. Conscientious efforts should be made to handle the 
suggestions of deputies and motions raised by the CPPCC members. 
We should give full play to the role of the trade unions, 
Communist Youth Leagues, the women's federations, and other mass 
organizations as a bridge and a link. It is necessary to 
realistically strengthen the work of handling people's letters 
and visits, experience and observe the conditions of the people, 
and conscientiously adopt the suggestions of the masses for 
rationalization. We should further establish and improve the 
system of democratic policymaking and supervision, extensively 
listen to opinions and suggestions from all sectors while making 
important measures, and make the policymaking more scientific, 
democratic and institutionalized. We should actively strengthen 
democracy in the grass roots, give full play to the role of 
workers congresses, neighborhood committees, and villagers 
committees, and guarantee that the grass-roots people can fully 
exercise their democratic rights. 
  b. We should attach great importance on the building of 
legal systems. Developing the socialist market economy requires 
us to have to master the practice of applying legal measures to 
managing economic activities and social affairs and to enhance 
the governmental work of legal systems. In line with the 
legislative plan formulated by the autonomous regional people's 
congress standing committee, we should vigorously draw up the 
draft plan for local regulations and rules concerned and 
formulate in a timely manner the administrative regulations of 
governments according to the demands of economic and social 
development. Efforts should be made to conduct the 
administrative work strictly according to the law and to enhance 
the supervision over law enforcement. We should also resolutely 
correct the problems of not abiding by the law, not strictly 
enforcing the law, not checking the violation cases, not 
implementing the order, and not carrying out prohibitions so as 
to safeguard the sanctity of the law. Efforts should be made to 
enhance the building of contingent of personnel in charge of 
enforcing the law, to upgrade the level of law enforcement work, 
to continuously deepen the "25" education on legal 
popularization, and to establish or develop the institutions of 
legal services so as to strengthen the concept of all citizens 
in legal systems. 
  c. We should vigorously grasp the social comprehensive 
management. Successfully grasping the comprehensive management 
of public security, making all-out efforts to safeguard the 
stability and social peace of the autonomous region, and 
providing a fine social environment for reform and development 
represent an unshirkable duty undertaken by governments at all 
levels and particularly by the political and legal departments. 
We should continuously and deeply wage the struggle of "dealing 
strict blows at crimes" and deal strict blows in line with the 
law at various criminal activities that are endangering the 
safety of the people's life and property and the modernizations. 
Efforts should be made to wage the struggle against the social 
evil phenomena, including the elimination of "six vices". The 
comprehensive management of public security is a systematic 
project. Therefore, various departments should closely 
coordinate with one another, make concerted efforts in the 
management, and establish or improve the network in which the 
masses are joining in the management and crime control. We 
should adopt a correct attitude toward and earnestly handle the 
contradictions among the people cropping up under the new 
situation as well as be good at mediating the disputes and 
relieving the contradictions so as to deal with the unstable 
factors that are adversely affecting the society in the 
embryonic stage. Governments at all levels should enhance their 
leadership over the management, implement the contracting 
system, enforce the "veto with one vote" system in the 
comprehensive management of public security, and realistically 
assume the political responsibility of "maintaining the social 
peace " of their own. 
  d. We should earnestly do a good job in the nationalities' 
affairs and the religious work. Enhancing the nationalities' 
unity and maintaining the border peace and the motherland's 
unification are areas in which the common desire and fundamental 
interests of the people of various nationalities lie. We should 
carry forward the fine tradition fostered by the cadres and 
masses of various nationalities with regard to mutual trust, 
study, assistance, respect, and existence so as to further 
consolidate and develop the socialist nationalities' 
relationship of equality, mutual assistance, unity, and 
cooperation. Efforts should be made to earnestly enforce the 
party's policy on nationalities' affairs, to deeply implement 
the "regional national autonomy law", and to vigorously grasp 
the fundamental issue of developing the economy so as to achieve 
common prosperity, unity, and progress among various 
nationalities. We should continuously enhance the work of 
Mongolian language and writing, earnestly implement the party's 
policy on religious affairs, and respect the freedom of believer 
and nonbeliever. We should not only protect the legal 
activities of religions but also enhance the management over 
religious affairs in line with the law. Currently, we should 
particularly guard against the hostile forces both at home and 
abroad, which are engaging in splitting activities by making use 
of the problems of national and religious affairs. 
  e. We should strive to do a good job in national defense. 
Guaranteeing a long period of order and stability in the border 
areas is our political responsibility. It is necessary to 
unswervingly conduct education on national defense and enhance 
the concept of national defense and the sense of people's air 
defense of all the people. We should actively support PLA 
building, strengthen management in the border areas, extensively 
conduct "double-support" activities, and further consolidate and 
develop unity between the army and the government and between 
the army and the people. The army and the local people should 
maintain close coordination and jointly attend to militia and 
reserve duty work as well as the settlement of servicemen who 
have retired or been transferred to civilian jobs. 
  f. We should deeply launch anticorruption struggle. 
Governments at all levels should fully understand the 
importance and urgency of anticorruption struggle, enhance the 
sense of misery, and unswervingly continue this struggle in an 
in-depth, sustained, and more effective manner. Cadres at all 
levels, leading cadres in particular, should perform their 
official duties honestly, do their administrative work 
diligently for the sake of the people, serve the people 
wholeheartedly, and serve as examples in fighting corruption and 
promoting honesty. It is necessary to conscientiously solve 
problems which the masses have strong complaints, step up 
efforts to investigate and handle major and appalling cases on 
corruption, bribe-taking, and serious malfeasance, and strictly 
punish corrupt elements. We should continue to check and 
rectify unhealthy trends in various trades, establish an 
effective supervision mechanism and a mechanism of restraints, 
give full play to the role of legal supervision, administrative 
supervision, mass supervision, and media supervision, and 
prevent and check the corrupt phenomena with systems. 
  Fellow deputies: 
  In the whole process of reform, opening up, and 
modernization 
drive, we must persistently uphold the principle of "taking a 
two- handed approach in work and be tough with both," strengthen 
socialist spiritual civilization, enhance the scientific and 
educational level as well as the ideological and moral level of 
the whole nation, and strive to cultivate well-educated and 
self- disciplined socialist people of a new type with lofty 
ideals and moral integrity. It is necessary to conscientiously 
study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and further enhance our awareness in 
implementing the party's basic line. We should strengthen 
philosophy and social sciences research work with 
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as a guidance, 
unswervingly conduct education on patriotism, collectivism, and 
socialism, and cultivate the moral habit of working hard, making 
progress with a matter-of-fact attitude, being ready to take up 
the cudgels for a just cause, and working honestly. We should 
display the superiority of ideological and political work, 
enhance spirit, advance in a pioneering spirit, and guide the 
people of various nationalities to actively plunge into the 
powerful current of the region's reform, opening up, and 
socialist modernization drive. 
  Building the socialist market economic structure is an 
unprecedented great cause. The mission vested by history is 
glorious but arduous. We must unify thinking, grasp the overall 
situation, work with one heart and one mind, and do all we can 
to forge ahead. We are firmly convinced that under the correct 
leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, 
and the regional party committee, and through the strenuous 
efforts of the people of various nationalities across the 
region, we will surely accomplish all tasks of this year and win 
new victories in reform, opening up, and the modernization drive.
