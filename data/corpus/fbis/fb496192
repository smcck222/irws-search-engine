<F P=106> [From "Chinese Economic News" Column: "Trading in </F>
State-Owned Enterprises' Property Rights Temporarily Suspended"] 
  [Text] The State Council General Office yesterday issued a 
circular on strengthening control over transactions in state 
enterprises' property rights. 
  As required by the circular, the market for these 
enterprises' property rights must be closed, and the operation 
of institutes engaged in this type of transactions must be 
temporarily suspended. The department concerned under the State 
Council will work out regulations on trading in state 
enterprises' property rights as soon as possible in order to 
standardize and legalize control over state enterprises' 
property rights transactions and the proceeds derived therefrom. 
  The circular stressed that provincial, autonomous regional, 
and municipal people's governments must apply to the State 
Council for approval before they can engage in transactions in 
state enterprises' property rights. The government, which has 
not gone through the above procedure, must immediately suspend 
existing transactions and apply for permission. The people's 
government at the prefectural city level and below shall not 
engage in transactions in state enterprises' property rights. 
  State enterprises are owned by the state. The transfer of 
the property rights of state enterprises controlled by local 
governments must be approved by the people's government at the 
prefectural city level and above. The State Council department 
concerned must apply to the State Council for approval before 
the property rights of state enterprises controlled by the 
central government can be transferred. The State Council's 
approval must be obtained before the property rights of 
exceptionally large or large state-owned enterprises (including 
those controlled by local governments) can be transferred. 
  According to the circular, before the property rights of the 
state-owned enterprise are transferred, the enterprise's assets, 
including the relevant land-use rights, must be assessed in 
accordance with the "Regulations on Assessing State-Owned 
Assets." The property rights must be transferred in accordance 
with the state's relevant regulations, and, after the transfer, 
the parties concerned must register with the proper authorities. 
The proceeds derived from transferring state enterprise 
property rights must first be used to pay off bank loans and 
make proper arrangements for the workers and must then be used 
by the people's government at the same level to support 
structural adjustment or to inject capital into the enterprise, 
which needs to be supported, instead of using the funds to cover 
running expenses or deficits, pay wages, or award prizes. The 
department managing state-owned assets must strengthen the 
supervision over the use of proceeds from transferring state- 
owned enterprise property rights. It is strictly forbidden to 
convert the property rights of state enterprises into shares, to 
sell them at low prices, to give them away to individuals 
without compensation, or to transfer the property rights and 
interests of state-owned enterprises on credit. Such mistakes 
must be corrected. Specific measures must be taken to properly 
solve problems concerning the workers' employment and social 
security in transferring the property rights of state 
enterprises.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chu Baoping (2806 0202 1627)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 14 May (XINHUA) -- At a recent national 
meeting of directors of posts and telecommunications bureaus, 
Posts and Telecommunications Minister Wu Jichuan said: China's 
fast-growing telecommunications capacity distinctly reflects the 
country's backward telecommunication services. Therefore, the 
posts and telecommunications industry will soon build a market- 
and client-oriented business and service system to completely 
improve posts and telecommunications service focusing on 
improving the service style and solving crucial problems. 
  According to the ministry's plan, problems in installing and 
relocating telephones will basically be solved within two or 
three years. Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, provincial capital 
cities, and coastal open cities should strive to create the 
necessary conditions for installing telephones in a timely 
manner; time for repairing problematic telephones should meet 
the standards set by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry; 
the problem of inaccurate telephone billing should be solved 
within a specified period; the system of allowing telephone 
users to inquire about telephone billing should be strictly 
implemented; time for mail delivery should be shortened; mail 
should be delivered to all accessible buildings in urban areas; 
and letters and newspapers should be properly delivered to all 
villages. 
  Wu Jichuan said: In addition to setting our eyes on the 
market and providing a series of regularized services, we should 
develop a service supervision mechanism that combines the 
efforts of posts and telecommunications departments and of our 
clients, and develop a system for feedback regarding our 
clients' complaints. Those who arbitrarily interrupt 
communications or retaliate against our clients must be severely 
punished on charges of sabotaging communications. Wu Jichuan 
stressed: From the perspective of safeguarding our clients' 
rights and interests, we should support our clients in filing 
complaints to higher authorities and in resorting to legal 
action. 
  At the meeting, Wu Jichuan particularly demanded that the 
public's recent responses to the postal and telecommunication 
service be relayed to the meeting's attendees. These responses 
included motions on the postal and telecommunication service 
tabled by National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference members; and the masses' response to the 
postal and telecommunication service reported by national 
newspapers, such as RENMIN RIBAO, XINHUA DAILY DISPATCH, and 
GONGREN RIBAO. This was the first time that such responses were 
relayed to attendees of a national posts and telecommunications 
meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, May 21 (CNS) -- China will start 
construction on some 70 local railway lines across the country 
in a decade to come measuring a total length of 7,000 kilometres. 
  The railway items which will be carried out in 12 provinces 
and municipalities have already been included into the Ninth 
Five Year Plan period which will lie between 1995 and the year 
2000. There were 81 local trunk railway lines across the 
country as of 1993 which ran for a total length of some 4,800 
kilometres in 17 provinces, municipalities and autonomous 
regions while nearly 20 others measuring a total length of 2,000 
kilometres are now under construction. 
  Work on railway lines in localities proceeded at the 
greatest 
pace during the past ten years with the track laying of trunk 
lines measured 2,460 kilometres. The gross spending was valued 
at nearly RMB [renminbi] 4.6 billion, of which RMB 4.1 billion 
was local capital while the Ministry of Railways accounted for 
RMB 440 million. 
  The so-called local railway lines are constructed with the 
use of capital shouldered by local governments which make them 
different from the state level railway lines. Local governments 
are either partly or fully responsible for the running of the 
railway lines. Local railway lines which have already been part 
of China's transport network have seen their development and 
construction planning included into the local as well as the 
state level programmes. 
  China has in recent years formulated a number of measures to 
speed up construction of railway lines in a bid to alleviate the 
tense state of railway transportation. Those measures included 
encouragement given to local governments to raise capital for 
the building of railway lines. Some preferential practices were 
available such as the setting of transportation charge by local 
governments, exemption of revenue tax, allocation of steel for 
railway track replacement without payment and subsidiary loan 
specially for local railway lines. 
  The central government also encouraged local governments to 
bring in foreign capital to construct railway lines. The World 
Bank, the Asian Development Bank, some Japanese financial groups 
and Taiwan offered capital to fund some local railway lines 
which are now under construction. Six local rail lines are 
ready for introduction of foreign investment for construction. 
  State level railway lines rose from 22,000 kilometres since 
1949 to 54,000 kilometres at present, a gain of some 30,000 
kilometres. Among them there were 41 rail lines running for a 
total of 3,100 kilometres which were handed over by local 
governments to the state for management, some of them became 
trunk lines. 
  Local rail lines will cover a gross length of over 8,000 
kilometres across the countries and the handling capacity will 
reach 100 million tonnes by the year 2000. [sentence as

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (CNS)--Deputy directors of Civil 
Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) Mr Jiang Zhuping, Mr Li 
Zhao, Mr Shen Yuankang and Mr Bao Peide distributed assessment 
cards to hundreds of domestic and foreign passengers in the 
departure building of the Capital International Airport for 
collection of opinion on CAAC service. Such practice is aimed 
at helping CAAC improve its service. 
  The service improvement campaign which began last year 
aroused so much concern from various sectors, according to the 
spokesman Mr Bao Peide [sentence as received]. As the handling 
capacity of CAAC boosted to some extent, problems including 
difficulties in buying air tickets as well as serious shortage 
of service facilities and equipment had been settled to a 
certain degree. Awareness of market competition and of better 
service held by various branches of CAAC were strengthened. 
Frigid manner in offering service, poor access to information on 
flight, poor service seen in irregular flight schedule, delayed 
handling of luggage and goods as well as problems concerning 
damage to and loss of items and fraudulent claims, however, 
still existed which aroused strong dissatisfaction. Mr Bao 
added that CAAC was determined to adopt measures to further 
solve all these problems in a bid to reverse the poor reputation 
for civil aviation service. 
  It is announced that the measures include inspection on 17 
air companies for their civil aviation service and 17 airports 
which see a heavy flow of passengers. Quality standard and 
regulations of civil aviation service will be closely examined. 
Inspectors will be specially hired to achieve this end. The 
rating of all these civil aviation establishments will be made 
for rewards and punishments. 
  Distribution of 100,000 assessment cards will be available 
in 
order to collect opinion on air service. A lucky draw is 
possible for the return of the cards. The deputy director of 
CAAC Mr Shen Yuankang said that the measures were aimed at 
encouraging civil aviation entities to make passengers and the 
market their criteria for better service. 
  The spokesman and deputy director Mr Bao Peide said that 
quality of service offered by CAAC would improve year by year in 
a bid to enable the aviation establishment in a period of time 
between three and five years to reach medium- and even 
high-level in the international community in terms of service 
offered.

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- What do you think of the 
services of China's Airlines? That is what passengers of the 
airlines under the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) 
will have the chance to answer on newly-launched "appraisal 
cards." 
  Jiang Zhuping, vice-director of CAAC, headed a group of CAAC 
staff this morning to issue the "appraisal cards" to hundreds of 
Chinese and foreign passengers at Beijing capital airport. 
  A spokesman for CAAC, Bao Peide, said that this was part of 
the efforts CAAC will carry out this year to improve passenger 
service quality. 
  He said that, starting from today, a total of 100,000 cards 
will be issued this year, and at the end of the year CAAC will 
list the 17 domestic airlines and major airports according to 
the passengers' appraisals. Those which have won high marks 
will get awards, while those with low marks will face sanctions. 
  The card asks for travellers' comments on 22 aspects of 
aviation services, including the service attitude of staff, 
flight punctuality and in-flight service. 
  Bao said that this year CAAC's major attention will be paid 
to the improvement of staff's service attitude and the services 
when flights are delayed.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Private Businesses Are Said To Need Private </F>
Banks"] 
  [Text] China should set up privately owned banks to assist 
the development of the country's private businesses, said the 
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (FIC). 
  Gu Qixuan, deputy director of the economic department of the 
FIC, said that China should consider setting up private banks to 
use the country's great amount of savings to supply individual 
businesses with much-needed cash for capital construction. 
  This has become clearly important, as the country's 
individual savings now exceed 1,200 billion yuan ($138 billion) 
and at least an other 400 billion yuan ($46 billion) is lying 
idle in the pockets of the public. 
  At the same time, many private firms are plagued by a severe 
shortage of capital for expanding production and updating 
manufacturing technology, he added. 
  Gu noted that some 10 per cent of the country's private 
businesses have suspended operations due to financial problems, 
while another 30 per cent are losing money in their operations. 
  The introduction of privately run banking firms would not 
only increase market competition to stimulate the State-run 
banks to strive for better operations, but would also create a 
new financial channel for the country's fledgling private 
industries. 
  The country's privately run industries, whose output last 
year surpassed 397 billion yuan ($45.6 billion), were often 
denied loans by the State banks, which give priority to the 
government's key projects. 
  In order to receive government financial support, some 
provinces and regions have given at least 83 per cent of the 
privately run rural enterprises the title of "collective firms," 
he added. 
  Gu predicted that by the end of this year, private 
businesses 
will number 370,000, up 55 per cent from the same period last 
year. 
  Their workforce will hit 5.35 million, up 54 per cent, and 
their registered assets will amount to 200 billion yuan ($23 
billion), a rise of 193 per cent from the end of 1993. 
  While strengthening the financial and tax management of the 
private businesses, government officials should also change 
their prejudice against individual businessmen, which have 
already become a major financial contributor to State coffers, 
he suggested. 
  China's private businesses are now awaiting government 
treatment equal to that given to State firms, even as the 
country wants to diversify its service industry as part of the 
efforts to develop a market-oriented economy. Along with the 
central government's decision in 1992 to encourage 
non-governmental businesses, most local authorities have also 
formulated their relevant policies on facilitating the 
development of local private businesses. 
  However, there remain imbalances in the development of 
private businesses among different regions of the country. 
  Official figures show that at least 69.85 per cent of the 
country's private businesses are now in East China, where 
economic development is faster than other areas. 
  Another 19 per cent are in Central China and only 1.18 per 
cent are in the western part of the country.

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Jie (1327 2638)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 16 May (XINHUA) -- Wu Xichun, news 
spokesman for the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, recently 
disclosed that a new situation had appeared on the domestic 
steel products market -- the total short-term supply of steel 
products exceeds demand. 
  The situation of China's iron and steel production has been 
very good since early this year. The output of finished steel 
products reached 27.6 million tonnes from January to April, 
registering an increase of 9.81 percent, or 2.46 million tonnes, 
over the output of 25.14 million tonnes posted in the same 
period last year. Excessive imports in the fourth quarter last 
year resulted in an oversupply of steel products. Coupled with 
the fact that the quantity of steel products imported in the 
first four months of this year posted growth of 5 percent over 
the same period last year, a new situation had appeared on the 
domestic steel products market -- total short-term supply of 
steel products exceeded demand. Prices on the domestic steel 
products market dropped in the past two months. The prices of 
steel products are predicted to basically stabilize for a 
certain period of time to come. In view of the fact that the 
current inventory of steel products kept by iron and steel 
producing enterprises showed an increase of approximately 27 
percent over the amount kept at the beginning of this year, Wu 
Xichun reminded foreign trade enterprises not to blindly import 
steel products. 
  Wu Xichun said: Due to the complex nature of the economy, 
the prices of certain steel products may rise and those of 
certain other steel products may drop, while the prices of most 
steel products will be stable. Iron and steel enterprises must 
pay close attention to market changes, continuously adjust the 
structure of their product range, and enhance their capability 
to adapt themselves to market changes.

<F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Tax Break Expected For Mines"] </F>
  [Text] The government is considering cutting the taxes on 
nonferrous metal mines as heavier tax burdens and spiralling 
costs are forcing almost all State-owned nonferrous metal mines 
out of business. 
  The China National Nonferrous Metals Industry Corp (CNNC) 
directly controls 87 mines around the country. About 85.5 per 
cent of them were running in the red last year. 
  The expected tax break will avert bankruptcy for the mines, 
which were burdened with new taxes beginning this year. 
  The value-added tax on mines was raised from 9 per cent to 
17 
per cent under the current taxation system. The mines also have 
to pay a newly added resource tax and resource compensation fee. 
  Putting these levies together nonferrous metals mines will 
have to pay 510 million yuan ($58.6 million) more this year if 
not granted some relief, said CNNC officials. 
  At the same time price hikes for electricity, coal, oil, 
steel and construction materials have driven up production costs. 
  Unlike other industries, nonferrous metal mines cannot raise 
prices because of the sluggish world market. 
  CNNC officials hope the government will provide favourable 
treatment and lighten the burdens to help these debt-stricken 
mines survive. 
  Most of CNNC's mines have been in operation for 30 to 40 
years. Some are exhausted and have to be closed. 
  Since 1992 the government has been lending money to these 
mines to help them relocate surplus labourers to other 
industries. 
  This is not an easy task, officials said, because these 
mines 
are located in remote areas. 
  In the past few years CNNC has not opened any new mines. 
Only a few are even being planned. 
  Without incentives, investors are not likely to inject money 
into mine constructions said CNNC officials. 
  In another development, China's first-quarter output of 10 
major nonferrous metals reached 829,600 tons, up 10.6 per cent 
over the same period last year. 
  However, profits and taxes dropped by 53.6 per cent. More 
than 75 per cent of the country's nonferrous metals producers 
are losing money.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- A passenger car is the most 
desirable product among young Beijing consumers, according to a 
recent private survey. 
  The survey, conducted in January by Hori and Co., a 
Tokyo-based business consulting firm, also showed that more than 
30 percent of the respondents preferred white in color. 
  The survey covered 1,000 residents of Beijing aged 16-30, 
nearly 80 percent of them white-collar workers. 
  About half of the pollees had a monthly income equivalent to 
about 10,400 yen to 14,300 yen. But a car costs the equivalent 
of between 650,000 yen and 2.6 million yen. 
  Next to a car, pollees said they wanted a condominium and a 
camcorder, according to the survey.

  [Text] The capital of Heilongjiang province, Harbin, has 
mapped out a plan to privatise the city's 5,000 or so small to 
medium-sized state enterprises. Zhu Sheng-wen, the deputy 
mayor, said Harbin was attempting to restructure these 
enterprises by way of sale or lease to foreign investors, or 
transform them into shareholding companies. 
  He said the city intended to privatise half of these 
enterprises by the end of this year, and privatise all of them 
by the end of next year. The restructuring programme had the 
approval of the central government. For large state 
enterprises, the privatisation will be through the issue of H 
shares, B shares or joint ventures with foreign partners, he 
said. 
  Mr Zhu is leading a Harbin trade delegation to Hong Kong. 
The 
delegation is offering foreign participation in about 200 
projects, including textiles, machinery, electronics, chemicals 
and light industry. Seventy-five small to medium-sized Harbin 
state enterprises are on sale to foreign investors. 
  New China Hong Kong Group, headed by businessman Tsui 
Tsin-tong, yesterday entered into deals for the restructuring of 
the Harbin Brewery Plant and an electrical machinery factory. 
The brewery joint venture will involve investment of about 580 
million yuan (about HK$516.2 million). New China Hong Kong 
holds a 54 percent stake in the project, according to Harbin 
officials. The electrical machinery project will cost U.S.$30 
million, and will expand and upgrade production. New China Hong 
Kong has a 45 percent interest in the venture. 
  Mr Zhu said about 40 percent of Harbin state enterprises 
were 
loss-making and restructuring was needed. There were about 
1,380 foreign-funded enterprises in Harbin, involving investment 
of $2.2 billion. A total of 652 such enterprises were funded by 
Hong Kong capital, worth a total of U.S.$560 million, he said. 
  In the first four months of this year, a total of 98 
foreign-funded enterprises were approved, involving a total 
foreign investment of U.S.$110 million from foreign partners, he 
said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "60 Percent of State-Owned Enterprises </F>
in Harbin City Suffer Losses; Authorities Plan To Change Most of 
Them To Nongovernmental Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Harbin, an important city in north China, has for 
years seen poor returns among state-owned enterprises, and of 
these, the number of loss-making ones is on the rise. The city 
has recently made a decisive decision, that is, except for a 
small number of backbone enterprises engaging in posts, 
telecommunications, railways, and roads, the city's 5,000 or so 
state-owned enterprises will be changed into nongovernmental 
enterprises by 1995 at the latest. 
  Harbin is the provincial capital of Heilongjiang, and the 
city's economic situation can be regarded as the epitome of the 
whole province. Sun Weiben, the provincial party secretary, and 
Shao Qihui, the provincial governor, are suspected of 
inefficient leadership and the inability to change the 
persistent situation of loss-making state-run enterprises, so 
they were stripped of their "official posts" by Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji during his recent inspection tour of the three northeast 
provinces. The posts of provincial party secretary and 
provincial governor have been taken by Yue Qifeng and Tian 
Fengshan respectively. 
  Harbin Vice Mayor Zhu Shengchu told reporters at a public 
occasion in Hong Kong yesterday that the number of loss-making 
state-owned enterprises in the city had reached a situation 
where "major surgery" was unavoidable. He said that in 1991, 
according to an estimate, over 40 percent of the 5,000 
state-owned enterprises in the city were losing money, and since 
last year the figure had risen to 60 percent, while many 
enterprises have ceased production or are operating at half 
capacity. 
  Zhu said that the city's plan to change state-owned 
enterprises to nongovernmental enterprises had won approval from 
the central authorities, and this was a pioneer move in 
contemporary China. At present, Harbin has 1.5 million people 
working in state-owned enterprises and units, and Zhu said that 
an absolute majority of cadres and workers "welcomed" the 
above-mentioned reform. 
  Zhu said that Harbin had decided to change more than 5,000 
state-owned enterprises in the city--except for a small number 
of backbone state enterprises engaged in posts, 
telecommunications, railways, roads, and communications--into 
nongovernmental enterprises no later than next year. Methods to 
be adopted will include the joint-stock system, auctions, and 
leasing to workers or persons in society. 
  This year, Harbin will first begin work to change 
state-owned 
enterprises in the four counties of Hulan, Acheng, Fangzheng, 
and Yilan to nongovernmental enterprises. Early this year, 
Binxian County took the lead in selling and leasing all 168 
state-owned enterprises to society. Some enterprises went to 
their workers, who bought shares. At present, all of the 
factories are able to pay wages, and economic returns have 
greatly improved.

  [Text] Guiyang, May 23 (XINHUA) -- China has succeeded in 
its water and soil control project on the upper reaches of the 
Chang Jiang river, the country's longest river, bringing 26,300 
square km of eroded land under control and raising forest 
coverage by 33 percent. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Chen Junfu, an official in 
charge of water and soil conservation in the Chang Jiang River 
Water Conservancy Committee, said that the water and soil 
erosion control project started in 1989 on 795 rivers and 
streams in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hubei 
provinces. 
  To carry out the government-funded construction, local 
farmers have been improving farmland and building various water 
conservation projects and water diversion canals. They have 
also planted economic and water and soil conservation trees in 
the project areas. 
  A recent survey of 169 of the rivers involved showed that 
the 
harnessing percentage has now reached 87, and 72 percent of the 
soil there has been retained. The per capita arable land in the 
area has gone up from 0.035 hectares to 0.07 hectares. Each 
farmer has added 0.02 hectares of fruit trees. 
  The official said China will increase investment in the 
water 
and soil erosion control project so as to bring 93,000 square 
kilometers of soil erosion land under control before the end of 
the century, with special focus on the three gorges dam, a 
multimillion dollars hydroelectric project being built on the 
Chang Jiang river.

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- China's rural bank 
savings amounted to 700.5 billion yuan by the end of May 15, 
thanks to a net increase of 90 billion during the January-May 
period this year. 
  Ma Yongwei, president of the Agricultural Bank of China 
(ABC) 
pledged here today to wipe out "IOU" notes in the state purchase 
of farm products in the summer and autumn harvest seasons. 
  The first four-and-a-half months of 1994 saw the fastest 
growth of China's rural savings, a 57.4 billion yuan increase 
compared with the same period last year. 
  The increase reflects a sound economic and financial 
situation and improved ABC services, Ma told a press conference 
today. 
  "Moreover, we can expect to have adequate fund resources to 
finance grain purchases this year," Ma said, stressing: "We 
shouldn't have any excuse to give farmers IOU notes instead of 
cash for their harvests." 
  According to the forecast of relevant departments, output of 
summer grain and rapeseed will exceed those of last year, if no 
major natural disasters occur during the next couple of weeks. 
  Though easing funds strains for the ABC, the deposit 
increase 
adds some pressure to the bank's business operation, some ABC 
officials noted. 
  Personal savings at present account for over 80 percent of 
ABC's operational capital, "with high cost of funds and 
considerable low-interest-rate policy lending, our bank is 
hardly profitable," said Ma. 
  He revealed that the ABC netted about 2.2 billion yuan in 
profits in 1993, the least among the four state specialized 
banks. The most profitable bank in China is the Bank of China 
which gained a profit of nearly 10 billion yuan last year. 
  However, a policy-oriented bank to finance agricultural 
production will start operation in the near future. "When we 
are relieved of policy lending, we have a brighter prospect to 
look forward to," said Ma.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Agriculture Bank Takes Record Farm Deposits"] </F>
  [Text] Farmers are saving more money than ever before, 
according to the Agricultural Bank of China. 
  The bank reported record rural deposits of more than 700 
billion yuan ($80.4 billion) at the end of last week. 
  Bank president Ma Yongwei said the bank had taken 90 billion 
yuan ($10.3 billion) of personal savings since last December. 
  Farmers have become richer since the government started 
paying them cash instead of IOUs, for their grain and 
vegetables, Ma said. 
  So, rural savings have soared. 
  "At present, the bank's individual savings are experiencing 
a 
unprecedented upsurge." Ma said, adding that over the past six 
months, the bank had taken 100 billion yuan $11.5 billion) from 
individual depositors in the countryside. 
  The surge in individual savings is good news for the bank, 
which, as a leading creditor in rural China, needs the money to 
back up government buyers of farm produce during the summer 
harvest, Ma said. 
  "We have pledged that there will be no more IOUs issued to 
farmers this summer," he said. 
  At least 80 per cent of the Agricultural Bank's individual 
savings are fixed deposits, which will be mainly used to fund 
farm production and grain purchase credits. 
  And arbitrary levies on farmers are also being brought under 
control by the government, further raising farmers' living 
standards, he said. 
  Most farmers now believe that bank savings are the best way 
of protecting their assets, the bank said. 
  The State Information Centre predicts that during the first 
half of this year, rural per capita income will grow 9 per cent. 
  Last year the country's farmers only earned 3.2 per cent 
more 
than in 1992, while urban residents saw their income rise by 
10.2 per cent during the same period. 
  The gap between rural and urban living standards appears to 
be narrowing this year.

  [Text] Beijing, May 24 (CNS)--The State Council of China 
has decided to enhance the ratio of agricultural loans to the 
total loan amount to 10 percent up from 6 percent of the last 
year in bid for the harvest of grain, cotton and vegetables and 
curbing the inflation. 
  Early this year, the Agriculture Bank of China set the 
agricultural loan of RMB 29 billion [renminbi], 28 percent up 
over last year. In addition, RMB 4 billion poverty-relief loans 
and RMB 2 billion loans for comprehensive development had been 
also arranged. The increase in ratio of agricultural loan set 
by the State Council makes it possible for above-mentioned loans 
to have corresponding increase. 
  The Agricultural Bank also stated that the special emphasis 
would be placed on supporting the development of agriculture and 
rural economy, on the development of high-added value industries 
and products, the implementation of "the Star Program" and the 
poverty-relief program of the eighth five-year plan in 
particular. 
  On May 22, Vice Premier Mr Zhu Rongji held a seminar on the 
economic works of seven provinces in Zhengzhou city of Henan 
Province, calling for local authorities at various level to 
carry out the agricultural policies of the central government 
and to bring into play of farmers' enthusiasm of planting grain 
and cotton in bid for the harvest of grain and cotton. The 
production of "the food basket" should be also handled well and 
the funds of purchase be guaranteed.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Opinion" page: "The Ripple Effect of </F>
Rural Migration"] 
  [Text] If the mass movement of peasants to the urban areas 
over the last few years is an indication of a trend, the '90s 
will possibly be remembered as the decade of migration. 
  Anyone having had the misfortune of riding a train during 
the 
Chines Spring Festival holidays can testify to the enormous 
scale of the migration taking place. 
  Young peasants, their belongings in a bedroll, clog railway 
station courtyards, often for days, before they head into the 
city to find their dream job as construction worker or domestics. 
  The exodus, mainly from central and western regions by 
farmers in search of a job in the east or coastal areas, has 
been analyzed in depth by the journal, Chinese Rural Economy 
[ZHONGGUO NONGCUN JINGJI]. 
  The study covers the migration's causes, characteristics and 
social impacts and discusses governmental attitudes and the need 
for action towards the phenomenon. 
  The scale of the migration has been swelling rapidly. 
Statistics from Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan and Jiangxi 
provinces indicate that, in 1982, fewer than 1 million farmers 
left their hometowns to do seasonal work in other areas. A 
decade later, the number had skyrocketed to at least 24 million. 
  The bulk of the increase has appeared in the last two or 
three years. 
  For example, in the first half of 1991, only 200,000 farmers 
left their hometowns in Jiangxi Province, but in 1993, more than 
3 million followed the tide--accounting for one fifth of the 
province's rural labourers. 
  Studies also show that the migrants are going further 
afield. 
In the early '80s, farmers worked only in neighboring cities or 
counties, but in 1993 20 million of them went to other provinces 
or even foreign countries. 
  They also have tended to stay away from their homes for 
longer stretches of time. 
  They are engaged in a greater variety of businesses, 
including industry, civil engineering, transport, commerce and 
service trades. Some have even become experienced technicians. 
  Among Beijing's lOO,OOO rural farmers from Anhui Province, 
57 
per cent of them work in the industrial and civil engineering 
sectors. 
  Migration is a gregarious activity. Few set out alone. Most 
travel in groups organized by themselves or local companies. 
  Many factors have contributed to farmers' migration. 
  Firstly, rural areas simply don't have enough jobs for all 
the labourers. At present, rural areas have more than 100 
million surplus labourers. As the population grows, the 
situation can only worsen. Demographers estimate that this 
number will swell by another 6 to 7 million. 
  Secondly, the rapid development of certain regions creates a 
need for migrant labourers. Once employed, migrants can earn 
about 2,500 yuan ($287) a year, far more than they were able to 
make back home. 
  Thirdly, the widening gap in the cost of living between 
different areas and trades is also a driving force. This is due 
in part to the soaring prices of fertilizers, insecticides and 
machinery needed for agriculture, while farmers can still fetch 
only relatively low prices for their goods. 
  Fourthly, the farmers' change of attitude and the 
governments' flexible policy towards migration have made the 
movement possible. 
  Overall, is migration a good or bad phenomenon? Undoubtedly, 
it has benefited both rural and urban areas. In 1992 migrating 
farmers from Sichuan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Henan and Jiangxi 
provinces earned a total of 28 billion yuan ($3.2 billion ). 
Farmers from Anhui alone made 7.5 billion yuan ($862 millions, 
2 billion yuan 1$230 million) more than the province's annual 
financial revenue. 
  The increase in the farmers' personal wealth has improved 
their living standards. Some money has been used to start other 
industrial businesses and service trades, thus creating more job 
opportunities. 
  Also, with fewer farmers cultivating the land and fracturing 
the market, the farms can, if well-managed, reach economies of 
scale with high productivity and reasonable profit margins. 
  Advanced regions have employed the cheap labour force to 
develop their industries and service sector as well as 
developing suburban agriculture for the city markets. 
  The flow of labour has strengthened the connection between 
rural and urban areas, helped the formation of a unified and 
open national labour market, and put pressure on the government 
to speed up the reform of residence and employment laws. 
Finally, migration has educated farmers. 
  However, the phenomenon is not without its negative 
consequences. Great pressure has been exerted on the country's 
transport, urban infrastructure and social stability. Some 
farmers see migration as an opportunity to skirt around family 
planning laws. 
  The article recommends the government take certain measures 
to put the migration in order. 
  Firstly, the government should set up a unified labour 
market 
composed of job centres that help the surplus labourers locate 
work. Information networks that provide forecasts on labour 
supply and demand would also be useful. Laws on labour, labour 
contracts and social security should be drafted. 
  Secondly, to facilitate the establishment of a unified 
labour 
market, trans-provincial co-operation should be enhanced to 
better regulate the labour flow. 
  Since 1991, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan provinces and Guangxi 
Zhuang Autonomous Region have decided to collaborate on the 
labour flow. A further five provinces have now joined the group. 
  In 1989, 70 per cent of the labourers entering Guangdong had 
no arrangements for work; now only 5 per cent of the annual 6.5 
million come without preparation. 
  Thirdly, the central government should make the development 
of labour resources part of the country's comprehensive social 
and economic development plan. 
  While planning for urban construction, the authorities 
should 
consider the issue of migration. 
  Policies should be made to encourage the shift of farmers to 
other businesses. The system of land use and the management of 
collective property should be reformed. Some places now permit 
farmers to transfer land-use rights, while some have introduced 
the share holding system in the management of collective 
property. The article said that these experiments are 
worthwhile. 
  The current residence registration system should be reformed 
to allow farmers to become urban residents in towns and small 
cities. 
  Fourthly, measures should be taken to check the volume of 
labourers during the busy Spring Festival period. 
  Lastly, rural township enterprises, towns, farmland capital 
construction and the service industry should be encouraged to 
create more job opportunities within the rural areas.

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- China will complete a 
34-volume collection of the biographies of 1,500 outstanding 
modern and contemporary scientists by 1995. This will be the 
first such work. 
  According to officials from the China Association for 
Sciences and Technology (CAST), eight volumes of the book have 
already been published. 
  Zhu Guangya, chairman of the association, who is in charge 
of 
the compilation, said that the book is a reflection of the 
contributions made by the scientists to China's achievements in 
science and technology and social progress. 
  The book contains precious records about the history of the 
country's scientific and technological development, said the 
chairman, who is one of the country's best known scientists. 
  In another development, a scientific and technological 
experts' publishing fund was set up today, with about one 
million yuan allocated by cast as capital. 
  The fund is designed to finance publication of the book, 
audio and video products about Chinese scientists and history of 
science and technology in modern and contemporary China. 
  Despite China's gradually increasing investment in sciences, 
many academic books could not be published because of inadequate 
financing. 
  The fund will accept donations from home and abroad.

  [Text] Washington, May 25 (XINHUA) -- India has Maruti. 
Malaysia has Proton. Suzuki can be found in Hungary. Fiat is 
in Poland. China has joint ventures with Volkswagen, Peugeot, 
Chrysler and General Motors. 
  It was the good old days when the world's industrial nations 
accounted for nearly all vehicle production and the bulk of 
their sales. The time has come for the developing world to cry 
for attention. 
  In 1993, the emerging markets, mainly central and eastern 
Europe, Southeast Asia, India, China, and Latin America, 
produced approximately 19 percent of the world's vehicles, twice 
that in 1985. 
  Next year, the World Bank said in a forecast, the emerging 
markets will absorb one-tenth of the world's car sales. Vehicle 
sales in these countries have been growing at least 30 percent 
annually. 
  "Many developing countries that aim to grow through 
industrialization regard the automotive sector as a suitable way 
to achieve this objective," said Yannis Karmokolias, author of 
several studies on automotive industry. 
  It is true that the automotive industry can be crucial in a 
nation's economy, as in the U.S., where auto accounts for five 
percent of gross national product and 17 percent of industrial 
employment. 
  Now, nine percent of manufacturing output and 10 percent of 
manufacturing employment in Mexico relates to car industry, 
while in Brazil, six percent of manufacturing output comes from 
auto making. 
  While absorbing aluminum and zinc alloys, iron and steel 
products, auto industry links extensively with marketing, repair 
and maintenance, fuel and lubricants, insurance, shipping and 
accessories. 
  Still, the industrial nations constituted three-fourths of 
the world car market. The big three of the U.S. are gaining 
market share. Some developing countries are hovering around 
self- sufficient level. 
  But opportunity is there: there is huge surge in car sales 
in leading Asian nations, sales rose by close to 50 percent in 
Hungary, and the registrations for cars in Mexico and Turkey 
have doubled in five years. 
  In recent discussions sponsored by the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC), emerging auto markets were ranked by current 
and potential size: Latin America leads India, China, ASEAN and 
Eastern Europe. 
  According to IFC estimates, in 1995, 77.5 percent of the 
world auto sales will go to the industrial nations, although 
Latin America and South Korea will account for 3.3 percent and 
2.5 percent respectively. 
  Developing countries should know, observers said, that their 
automotive industries do not need to start with assembly, as has 
been the case, but could be based on component manufacturing 
that might lead to assembly. 
  While developing countries regard Western countries as major 
markets for their vehicles, these countries appeared less 
interested in developing and sustaining their domestic markets, 
observers said. 
  "To encourage domestic sales yet avoid being swamped by 
imports requires a careful mix of policies related not only to 
domestic production, but also to trade, pricing and credit," the 
IFC said in a recent policy paper. 
  In some developing countries, governments are withdrawing 
from the sphere of auto production, especially in Latin America, 
where not a single share of auto component firms are held by 
public authorities. 
  But in Asia, the governments' role in shaping trade 
policies, 
exchange rates, regulations, price structures, access to credit, 
privatization and the handling of the labor force remains 
extensive. 
  On policy, some governments are advised not to change gear 
in 
jerky fashion, or set auto industry policy too rigidly, which, 
observers said, might lead to the industry's weakening and 
turmoil.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The United States has 
proposed that an additional five areas of trade be upgraded to 
"priority" sectors for the bilateral trade framework talks which 
are to be resumed between it and Japan. 
  The KYODO NEWS SERVICE today quoted Japanese Government 
sources as saying that the U.S. Government has suggested that 
financial services, glass, intellectual property, lumber, and 
antitrust policy and deregulation be added to the list of 
priority areas for negotiations. 
  Currently, the priority sectors in the wide-ranging 
framework 
are government procurement of telecommunications and medical 
equipment, insurance, and auto parts. 
  The sources were quoted as saying that the Japanese 
Government will basically accept the U.S. proposals apart from 
the lumber sector. 
  KYODO said the proposal was made during vice 
ministerial-level discussions in Washington which led to the 
breakthrough in the framework talks following a three-month 
stalemate. 
  The trade framework negotiations were agreed upon last July 
as a means of cutting Japan's swelling trade surplus with the 
United States, but hit a snag in February this year due to a 
discord over a U.S. demand for "objective criteria" to measure 
the opening of Japan's market to foreign imports. 
  Meanwhile, Japan's Ambassador to the United States Takakazu 
Kuriyama said his country needed to take steps to significantly 
reduce its politically sensitive current account surplus and 
implement a market-opening package to successfully conclude the 
bilateral trade talks. 
  Kuriyama, who is currently in Japan to prepare for the 
upcoming visit to the United States by Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko, made the statement at a press conference at the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  He said Tokyo and Washington agreed to resume the stalled 
framework talks because both sides shared the view that it is 
undesirable to keep tense economic and trade relations 
"drifting" since that would hurt overall bilateral relations. 
  He added that the two countries also reached the accord 
because it deepened understanding about each other's positions 
on the trade talks.

<F P=106> [By Liu Yongping 0491 3057 1627: "Has U.S.-Russian </F>
`Partnership' Matured?"] 
  [Text] The world's focus on relations between the United 
States and Russia, which are no longer opponents, reached a high 
tide from 12 to 15 January. During the first three or four days 
of this year, U.S. President Clinton made his first official 
visit to Russia since assuming office. It was the second 
official meeting between the heads of state of the two countries 
after their April 1993 meeting in Vancouver. 
  Russia has said that the talks at the most recent meeting 
had 
"very enriched contents and were most businesslike and 
substantial" compared with all previous summits. Leaving aside 
a dozen important documents signed between the two sides, the 
"Moscow Declaration" signed by the two presidents shows that 
Clinton presented a new thing during his current trip, that is, 
he announced that the United States and Russia have entered "a 
new and mature stage of strategic partnership." Apparently, 
this new formulation constitutes a big step forward compared 
with the U.S.-Russian ties which had changed from being 
opponents during the "Cold War" to the "strategic partners" they 
declared to be at the Vancouver summit nine months ago. How 
could the United States and Russia, the long-standing enemies 
during the "Cold War," cause their recently established ties of 
"strategic partnership to mature" within the short period of 
only 9 months and then enter a "new stage"? Is it a diplomatic 
miracle or merely a political show? 
<H5>  Each Side Has Its Own Intentions </H5>
  The Moscow meeting was held at a time when there were 
various 
complicated factors in the international situation and the U.S. 
and Russian domestic situations. Russia's radical reform 
measures suffered setbacks and the ultranationalist forces were 
on the rise at home; there was a strong demand in the United 
States to "be cautious in maintaining relations with Russia"; 
and turbulence continued in Europe and the disputes over whether 
East European countries and the former Soviet Union should join 
NATO were intensifying. These scenes formed the background to 
the latestt U.S.-Russian summit. 
  Against such a background, the primary consideration for the 
United States was to clearly state U.S. support for Yeltsin via 
the summit, to exert an influence on Russia's political 
situation. The United States has always believed that the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, and Russia's reforms aimed 
at establishing a Western-style "democratic society," are the 
greatest victories of the "Cold War." However, the unexpected 
victory of the Russian Communist Party and ultranationalist 
forces in the 1993 December parliamentary elections, 
particularly the crazy "remarks" by Zhirinovsky, sent a warning 
to the U.S. Government. Hence, helping Russia "steadily realize 
the democratic transition" became an urgent task for the United 
States to consolidate the "Cold War" victory and ensure the 
establishment of a new international order. Second, placating 
Russia through the establishment of the "mature strategic 
partnership" to win Russia's support and cooperation in handling 
the regional security and nuclear nonproliferation issues. 
Although Russia is no longer a superpower following the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, its military strength and 
geopolitical influence cannot be ignored. Moreover, it still 
exerts a great influence on the countries of the former Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe and it would be unimaginable for the 
United States to establish a new security structure in Europe 
without Russia's support. The United States intends to make use 
of Russia to check the tendency of Western Europe to drift away 
from the United States so that it can play a leading role in 
Western Europe and also exert an influence on the whole of 
Europe, including the countries of the former Soviet Union and 
East Europe. 
  Through the recent meeting, Russia tried to prove to the 
United States its irrevocable reform and used promises (that is, 
not allowing the pace of reform to slow down) in exchange for 
U.S. economic aid and support for the Yeltsin government. 
Through the establishment of an "equal" and "strategic 
partnership," Russia also tried to show the world that "it was a 
big country like the United States" and that the United States 
had to admit Russia's "special status" and "leadership" over the 
countries of the former Soviet Union and East Europe. 
<H5>  False Display Exceeds Substantiality </H5>
  During the recent meeting, both sides exchanged views on a 
wide range of issues including Russia's domestic situation and 
economic reform, Europe's security system, Ukraine's nuclear 
problem, and the establishment of mutual trust and comprehensive 
bilateral cooperation and reached a series of agreements. The 
two sides also agreed to hold another two meetings between the 
head of states before the end of the year. 
  To sum up, the following achievements were attained at the 
recent meeting: First, the "Moscow Declaration" stated that the 
United States and Russia had "entered a new stage of their 
mature strategic partnership." The declaration set a high tone 
for the current U.S.-Russian ties of cooperation. However, 
whether Clinton and Yeltsin can continue to sing in a high tone 
depends to a great extent on the future trend in Russia's 
political situation and whether the changes in its foreign 
policy can be brought into line with the United States. Viewed 
from the recent changes in Russia's domestic situation, the 
future is by no means optimistic. Second, Yeltsin told Clinton 
that Russia "will continue its reform and not slow the pace" 
while Clinton reiterated that the United States resolutely 
supported Russia's "democratic market transformation." Clinton 
also said that he will fulfill the economic aid promise made 
after the Vancouver summit and declared that he had urged the 
U.S. Congress to make a decision on offering Russia $900 million 
in economic aid by the end of 1995. The United States also 
agreed to reduce the tariffs on over 4,000 commodities imported 
from Russia and to "work positively" to remove the trade 
restrictions and discriminatory trade policy toward the former 
Soviet Union. However, the United States failed to make new 
offers on economic aid. As everyone knows, the West has merely 
paid lip service rather than offering economic aid in the past. 
  Even if the promise on economic aid is honored, it will be 
inadequate for Russia's ailing economy. As to Yeltsin's promise 
of not slowing down the pace of reform, it has probably become a 
rubber check following the dismissal of Gaidar and other 
"reformers." Third, the two countries decided to stop targeting 
their missiles against each other or their allies before the end 
of May this year. This move seems to have dispelled the West's 
nuclear phobia left over from the former Soviet Union. When 
there is no mechanism to examine the implementation of this 
agreement, however, it can only be a symbolic political game. 
What is more, it is an easy technical job to resume the 
targeting of these nuclear weapons. Fourth, the United States 
and Russia jointly compelled Ukraine to sign the 
Russia-U.S.-Ukraine Agreement on destroying all the nuclear 
weapons in Ukraine within a prescribed time. This was regarded 
by Clinton as a "breakthrough" in "strengthening the security 
and stability of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia and the 
world as a whole." Western media also believe that this is the 
only substantial achievement scored in the recent summit. 
Nevertheless, a demonstration against the agreement was held in 
Ukraine during the signing of the agreement by the three 
parties. The Ukrainian parliament ratified the agreement on 3 
February but refused to approve the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty. As the political situation in Ukraine is unstable and 
the people have heightened their vigilance against the rising 
tendency of Russian nationalism, the Ukrainian Government will 
encounter numerous problems in implementing the three-party 
agreement. Since the destruction of nuclear weapons is to be 
completed within 7 years, some experts believe that even if the 
political troubles are ruled out, the question of Ukraine's 
nuclear problem is far from being resolved technologically and 
in terms of funds and timing. 
<H5>  Not Yet Mature </H5>
  Despite the achievements attained at the recent meeting and 
the enhanced ties between the two countries, it is "probably too 
early" to say that the two countries have entered a "mature new 
stage of strategic partnership." According to the general 
understanding, a "mature strategic partnership" refers, at the 
very least, to ties of mutual trust, equality, and comprehensive 
cooperation. Viewed from the current situation, however, the 
United States cannot rest assured of the development of Russia's 
domestic situation. Not long after Clinton met with and 
extended his regards to Gaidar while in Russia, Gaidar and 
Feyaodorov, who were regarded as "symbols of reform," left the 
government. The U.S. media believe that this is a sign of a 
slowdown in Russia's economic reform. After the meeting, some 
American experts insisted that the rise in Russia's nationalism 
and the forces of the former Communist Party constitute a 
component part of Russia's political reality. Russia's internal 
and external policies will undoubtedly be conditioned and 
influenced by these forces. The uncertain factor in Russia's 
policies toward the West will increase and trouble might crop up 
in U.S-Russian ties. Because of Russia's unstable internal and 
external policies, some experts of the U.S. Heritage Foundation 
and Carnegie Endownment for International Peace believe that 
U.S.-Russian "cooperation will reduce" and "the prospects are 
dreadful." Regarding Russia, it also strongly distrusts the 
United States. Even Foreign Minister Kozyrev, who is regarded 
as pro-Western, expressed the following view: No Western power 
has truly shown concern for Russia's revitalization. Such a 
mentality of the two sides not trusting each other is bound to 
affect the "strategic partnership" between the two countries. 
  Second, U.S. policy toward Russia is immature. During 
Clinton's stay in Russia, the United States indicated that there 
should be more "treatment" and less "shock" in Russia's reform. 
When there were indications of a readjustment of the economic 
reform policies introduced by the new Russian Government not 
long after the meeting, the call within the United States urging 
Russia not to slow down the pace of economic reform immediately 
took the upper hand. Newly appointed deputy secretary of state 
Talbot, who was ambassador-at- large to the former Soviet Union, 
has openly said that if Russia slows down its economic reform, 
"the date for it to receive the $1.5 billion loan from the IMF 
will continue to be postponed." The U.S. Congress also 
criticized Clinton once again for putting all his stake on 
Yeltsin. Thus, it can be seen that U.S. policy toward Russia 
can mature only after a period of exploration. 
  Third, U.S.-Russia cooperation on international issues is 
limited. During the recent meeting, although Yeltsin expressed 
support for NATO's establishment of a "peaceful partnership" 
with Eastern Europe, he also said that it was one of the options 
for building a new Europe. In fact, Russia still keeps a wary 
eye on the U.S. eastward strategy. Regarding the region covered 
by the former Soviet Union, Clinton stressed at the meeting that 
the "independence gained by Russia's neighbors must be 
respected" and hoped that "Russia could totally withdraw its 
troops from the three Baltic states this year." Yeltsin once 
again indicated that Russia assumed a "special status" and 
"leadership" over the region of the former Soviet Union. The 
tunes by the two leaders were not in harmony. In his State of 
the Union Message on 25 January, Clinton pointed out that action 
by the Russian troops in the neighboring countries should be 
taken only in light of the agreements reached with the parties 
concerned and based on international rules. Apparently, the 
purpose was to check Russia's "re-expansion" in the former 
Soviet Union. On the second day after Clinton's remarks, 
Zhatulin, chairman of Russia's CIS Affairs and Overseas Russian 
Liaison Committee, told the press: "Everyone knows that these 
nations (countries of the former Soviet Union) are within 
Russia's sphere of influence." On other international issues 
involving their vital interests, the two countries will not 
easily make concessions for the sake of the so-called "strategic 
partnership." 
  In a word, the strategic interests of the two countries and 
their geopolitical positions determines their so-called "global 
strategic ties of cooperation" can only be established on the 
basis of bargaining and maintaining the interests of each side. 
Being opponents as well as partners, rivalry as well as 
cooperation will continue as the main line of U.S.-Russian ties 
for some time to come.

  [Text] Moscow, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin said here today that the great 
potential in Sino-Russian relations is far from being fully 
developed, and suggested that his forthcoming visit to China 
would promote the relations. 
  In an interview with XINHUA in his office today before 
leaving for Beijing on an official visit, Chernomyrdin said he 
is expecting his visit to China to be successful. 
  He said Russia and China should maintain a normal 
relationship of good neighborliness, and the governments of the 
two countries should create better conditions for developing 
cooperation in trade and science research. 
  He said the 1992 visit to China by President Boris Yeltsin 
was a big push for the development of relations between the two 
countries, and that they have been growing smoothly ever since. 
  "One of the fruits of President Yeltsin's visit to China, 
was 
the increase in trade volume between the two countries which 
reached eight billion U.S. dollars in 1993," he said. 
  Chernomyrdin added that there are a lot of things which link 
Russia and China and there is a good basis for maintaining a 
relationship of good neighborliness between the two countries. 
  He suggested that the two countries increase personnel 
exchanges. 
  "There were a lot of Chinese experts studying in Moscow, St. 
Petersburg and other Russian cities once upon a time. Now quite 
a number of them are in key positions in China. This tradition 
should be carried on by us. We are glad to see more Chinese 
delegations visiting and it is also possible that we would like 
to send university students to China, which is very important," 
said Chernomyrdin. 
  He emphasized that the two countries should expand 
cooperation and exchange in scientific research. 
  He said he also expected to sign a number of agreements of 
cooperation with Chinese leaders on such matters during his stay 
in Beijing. 
  On trade relations between the two countries, Chernomyrdin 
said the governments of the two countries should create better 
conditions for development and simplify the procedures of trade 
and cooperation.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The second meeting of 
the Sino-Russian Joint Commission on Economic, Trade, Scientific 
and Technological Cooperation was held here this afternoon. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and visiting Russian Deputy 
Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin co-chaired the meeting and they 
exchanged opinions on issues of furthering bilateral economic, 
trade, scientific and technological cooperation in a 
constructive way. 
  Li said that Sino-Russian economic and trade relations have 
made much progress, with bilateral trade volume last year 
reaching 7.7 billion U.S. dollars, nearly twice the highest 
figure between China and the former Soviet Union. 
  He noted that there is vast potential for bilateral economic 
and trade cooperation, for bilateral trade volume last year only 
made up less than 4 percent of China's total foreign trade 
volume. 
  Both countries agreed that their two highly complementary 
economies and their location provide a good base for furthering 
bilateral economic and trade relations. 
  Although the Sino-Russian trade volume is not very big, Li 
said he believes that Russia will become an important trade 
partner of China. 
  They also exchanged opinions on existing problems in 
bilateral economic, trade, scientific and technological 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [By reporter Hu Hanying (5170 3352 5391)] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 24 May (XINHUA) -- Russian Minister of 
Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov pointed out: 
Sino-Russian economic and trade relations will become healthier 
and more mutually beneficial, and have bright prospects for 
further development. 
  Davydov made the statement during a recent interview with 
this XINHUA reporter. 
  While reviewing the past, Davydov said: Since 1992, both 
Russia and China have been implementing measures that encourage 
bilateral trade. Consequently, Sino-Russian bilateral trade 
value in 1992 was $5.862 billion, up 50 percent on the trade 
value between the former Soviet Union and China in 1991. In 
1993, Sino-Russian trade continued to grow, reaching $7.679 
billion, an increase of 30.9 percent over that of 1992; out of 
the total, Russian exports to China increased 41.4 percent, and 
imports from China rose 15.2 percent. He said: In 1993, China 
became Russia's second largest trading partner; Germany topped 
the list. 
  The foreign economic relations minister frankly admitted: In 
the first quarter of 1994, Sino-Russian trade value has slid 
temporarily, down 43.5 percent over the same period of 1993. 
Analyzing major reasons for the declined trade value, Davydov 
said: Russian industrial output has been dropping; commodity 
prices have been rising; and transportation expenses have 
increased. All these factors have adversely affected the 
commercial organizations' enthusiasm to export. Meanwhile, 
fewer Russian resources for exports, higher customs duties, and 
governmental supervision over the export of raw and semifinished 
materials are other contributory factors that have led to the 
lower trade value. Additionally, Russian consumer markets have 
been relatively saturated with commodities imported from China. 
  Minister Davydov believed: The downward trend in 
Sino-Russian trade is temporary, because further expanding 
bilateral economic cooperation suits the mutual benefit of both 
countries. He proposed: Bilateral trade issues that need to be 
resolved most urgently at present are as follows: Both 
countries should ensure smooth traffic on transportation routes. 
In accordance with changed circumstances, both countries should 
amend the original Sino-Russian bilateral trade agreements so 
that they will be compatible with the new conditions. The 
central banks of both countries should reach an agreement 
whereby some trading transactions, other than state-level 
trading transactions, can be settled with their own currencies. 
Both countries should improve policies on bilateral trade that 
is state-regulated. Furthermore, both countries should provide 
reliable information for entrepreneurs and traders in the two 
countries. They should also resolve debt issues remaining 
between them from the past. 
  Davydov expressed his belief: Russian Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit to China will facilitate 
Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation to develop in a 
healthy and stable manner.

<F P=106> [By reporter Kuo Hung-chih (6753 1347 3112): "Russia To </F>
Authorize China To Manufacture Sukhoi Su-27 Fighters"] 
  [Excerpt] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
arrives in Beijing today for a four-day visit. Aside from 
discussing economic issues with Beijing, he will conclude with 
the Chinese side a final agreement on authorizing the latter to 
manufacture Sukhoi Su-27 fighters. 
  According to a source in Beijing, China is discussing the 
issue of transferring manufacturing techniques for Su-27 
fighters. Beijing is very likely to gain the license. While 
meeting with high-ranking Beijing leaders, Chernomyrdin will 
probably finalize the move. The mainland has purchased 26 
Su-27's from Russia and an order for another 26 Su-27K's is 
under negotiation. 
  Apart from matters related to the Su-27, Chernomyrdin will 
reportedly discuss cooperation between the two countries in the 
hi-tech field, including cooperation in the hi-tech defense area. 
  Aleksandr Shokhin, deputy Russian prime minister and head of 
the Russian side of the "Russian-Chinese Economic, Trade, 
Scientific, and Technological Council," yesterday called upon 
Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of China's Central Military 
Commission. Though both sides did not disclose the specific 
contents of the meeting, it is believed that they must have 
touched upon arms deals. Shokhin is responsible for trade with 
China, while the arms deal is part and parcel of bilateral trade. 
  Shokhin came to Beijing to attend the "Russian-Chinese 
Economic, Trade, Scientific, and Technological Council" meeting 
due to open on next Tuesday. The meeting is scheduled to be 
held once a year, but it has been 18 months since the last 
meeting. In the first quarter of this year, the bilateral trade 
volume dropped by 43.5 percent compared with the same period 
last year. The coming meeting is designed to clear away 
obstacles hindering the expansion of bilateral trade. [passage

  [Text] United Nations, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese 
delegate said here today China is expecting diplomatic relations 
with Palau. 
  "China is willing to develop friendly relations and 
cooperation with an independent Palau on the five principles of 
mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual 
non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence," 
said Zhang Yan, one of the Chinese delegates attending the 61st 
session of the UN Trusteeship Council. 
  A target date of October 1, 1994 has been set for 
implementation of the compact of free association between Palau 
and its administering authority, the United States, the 
Trusteeship Council was told by representatives of those two 
governments as the council began today its sixty-first session. 
  According to the compact, which was signed by Palau and the 
U.S. in 1982 but only approved last November, Palau will become 
an independent and sovereign state. 
  Kuniwo Nakamura, president of Palau, said the next time 
Palau 
stood before the United Nations, he hoped it would do so as a 
sovereign and independent country and as a member state. 
  Zhang Yan said China has all along supported the people of 
the trust territories in their efforts for national 
self-determination and their aspiration for national independent. 
  "The Chinese people cherish friendly sentiments towards the 
Palau people, we are looking forward to Palau becoming an 
independent member of the international community and embarking 
on the road of economic development and building up the country 
at an early date," he said. 
  Palau is situated in western Pacific, one of important 
waterways to the Southeast Asia from the West. 
  Now it is the only one UN trusteeship land. In November, 
1993, there was a successful plebiscite in Palau, which approved 
the compact of free association.

  [Text] According to information from Beijing, two people 
who were imprisoned because of their involvement in the 4 June 
Incident in 1989 in Shanxi Province were recently released on 
bail for medical treatment and have returned home.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said that the whole nation should support Shanghai's Pudong New 
Area's development and opening to the outside world, and the 
area, in turn, should serve national economic growth, reform and 
opening to the outside. 
  He made these remarks during his May 23-25 inspection of 
Shanghai, following his tour of neighboring Jiangsu Province. 
  He noted that it was a most important decision of Deng 
Xiaoping's to develop the Pudong Area and to open it to the 
outside world. 
  Li, who has gone to Shanghai each year since the central 
government's decision to develop and open the Pudong New Area in 
1990, was pleased to see the great achievement that the new area 
made in the past few years. 
  By the end of last year, there were some 3,100 separate 
domestic investments and some 1,600 overseas investments, 
attracting a combined overseas investment of 3.27 billion U.S. 
dollars in contractual volume. 
  Shanghai is where the Chang Jiang River flows into the sea. 
The city has a vast hinterland which is quite advanced 
industrially, and in commerce and transport. A large number of 
highly skilled and talented people have also gathered there, Li 
Peng noted. 
  The central government will continue to give its policy 
backing to the Pudong New Area since it is still under 
construction and needs a continuous policy on development and 
opening to the outside world, he said. 
  He said Shanghai should be built into one of the world top 
economic, financial and trade centers. 
  To achieve that target, he said, Shanghai should make 
concentrated efforts to make use of the favorable conditions 
that Shanghai enjoys. 
  Shanghai should develop international shipping and establish 
an advanced network of domestic and international 
transportation, he said. He pointed out that the clearance of 
the Chang Jiang River course will make it possible for Shanghai 
to become a world shipping center. 
  More domestic and foreign trade channels should be opened 
and 
specialists on international trade be trained so that the city 
can become an international trade center, he said. 
  The service industries, especially finance, trade and 
shipping, should be developed as a key sector, he stressed. As 
for the secondary industry, he added that a group of large new 
and high-tech and export-oriented projects should also be 
constructed as a new pillar industry for the city. 
  On agriculture, the premier said that vegetable planting 
should be stressed and stable farming production centers should 
take shape in the rural areas administered by Shanghai. 
  The premier inspected the Pudong New Area and the famous 
Yangpu Bridge that links the city proper to the new development 
zone. 
  Wu Bangguo, secretary of Shanghai Municipal Committee of the 
Chinese Communist Party, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, as well as 
officials from the State Council accompanied him during the tour.

swindling, stealing and robbery and to guarantee the safety of 
funds at banks across China. 
  At the teleconference, Zhu Rongji, vice-premier and also 
governor of the People's Bank of China, said that financial 
crimes, such as cases of swindling, have become an eye-catching 
problem in the field of finance over the past years. 
  He urged cadres and staff in the financial organizations at 
various levels to sharpen their sense of responsibility in 
protecting state assets and safeguarding state benefits. 
  He also called for a strict implementation of China's

  Zhou Zhengqing, deputy governor of the People's Bank, 
outlined measures for curbing and preventing swindling, stealing

public security organizations at various levels to give full 
support to and closely cooperate with banks in preventing and 
cracking down on crimes involving swindling, stealing, bank 
robbery and in protecting the safety of capital in banks. 
  Public security departments must adopt firm and effective 
measures to control illicit money made by stealing, bank 
robbery, and from crimes such as forgery, stealing and reselling 
at a profit bills of value added taxes, once such crimes are 
reported to them, so as to avoid or reduce the losses to the 
minimum, while concentrating manpower to detect and deal with 
offenders. 
  Relevant departments of the State Council, financial 
organizations across the country, the Supreme People's Court, 
the Supreme People's Procuratorate and officials from other

<F P=106> [By reporters Zou Aiguo (6760 1947 0948) and Yin Xuecheng </F>
(3009 1331 2052)] 
  [Text] Nanjing, 24 May (XINHUA) -- In the conference room 
of Jiangsu's Yangzhou Bus Main Manufacturing Plant, State 
Council Premier Li Peng asked the plant's director Ju Baocai: 
"What is the key to efficient operation of state-owned large- 
and medium-sized enterprises?" 
  On the morning of 20 May, Premier Li Peng inspected the 
plant, which produces 5,000 buses annually. Despite a fall in 
the bus market last year, the plant still produced and sold 
4,350 buses with a sales income of 560 million yuan, paid 50.08 
million yuan in profit tax, and made 41.62 million yuan profit, 
a growth of 105 percent over 1992. Because of the success in 
various technological transformation projects, the plant's 
principal economic indices have been ahead of its counterparts 
nationwide for five consecutive years. After viewing the 
production assembly and workshop, Li Peng held a discussion 
meeting with the plant's staff in the conference room. 
  After a brief thought, Ju Baocai answered the premier's 
question: "The primary requirement is to have a good policy. 
The city committee and government have given us preferential 
treatment..." 
  After noting down the main points of Ju Baocai's remarks, Li 
Peng asked again: "What you have said is correct, but what is 
the key issue?" 
  Comrades attending the discussion meeting became very 
interested in the premier's quiz of the plant director. 
Yangzhou City Mayor Shi Guoxing added: "I think the main issue 
is whether the operating mechanism is flexible or not." 
  Li Peng said: "This is also an important reason." 
  Communications Minister Huang Zhendong, who accompanied the 
premier on his inspection, said: "The key lies with the market." 
  Li Peng said: "That is correct! I think the key to 
efficient operation of state-owned large- and medium-sized 
enterprises lies with the market. Enterprises must gear 
themselves toward the market and satisfy market demand. In a 
market economy, state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises 
must exploit their edge by producing salable products with the 
batch processing method. Only then can enterprises be 
competitive and have their economic efficiency upgraded." 
  Citing the development of Yangzhou Bus Main Manufacturing 
Plant as an example, Li Peng further explained: "In the past, 
your plant repaired automobiles and later produced small-sized 
trucks. But now you are the nation's largest bus producing 
plant. Had you chosen trucks, not buses, as your principal 
products in the first place, could you have won the competition 
against the First Automobile Works and Second Automobile Works? 
State-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises not only 
possess the edge in technological setup and higher quality of 
their personnel, but also in fine traditions. If they gear 
themselves toward market demand based on their actual 
conditions, select correct development strategies, and actively 
open up the market, they can definitely move onto the path of 
vitalization." 
  The premier's remarks won Ju Baocai's agreement. It is 
exactly the market that has brought about profound changes to 
Yangzhou Bus Main Manufacturing Plant. The 3,000-worker bus 
plant produces its "Ya Xing" buses in six series of large, 
medium, and light sizes as well as high, medium, and general 
grades with 45 various models. The products are sold in 30 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities nationwide, 
with part of the products exported. In 1991, Premier Li Peng 
presented 40 large-sized buses from the plant to the Philippine 
Government as a gift. 
  Li Peng offered an analysis: "Of course, we should realize 
that in the process of deepened reform and transfer to the 
market economic system, some enterprises have met with some 
difficulties to varying degrees, and their economic efficiency 
is low. This is caused by various factors. We should have full 
confidence in efficiently operating state-owned large- and 
medium-sized enterprises as well as attach importance to their 
present difficulties." 
  Li Peng said: "To efficiently run state-owned large- and 
medium-sized enterprises, it is necessary to tackle three areas: 
First, enterprises must be geared toward the market so that 
their products continue to correspond with domestic and foreign 
market demands; second, enterprises must establish a good 
mechanism suited to the socialist market economy; and third, 
enterprises must attach importance to technological progress as 
well as enhance their staying power in development and 
competitiveness." 
  Ju Baocai told the premier: "During the `Eighth Five-Year 
Plan,' our plant invested 150 million yuan in technological 
transformation in stamping [chong ya 0394 1090], chassis, seat, 
body works, and assembly line, and we will soon enter the market 
with a new posture." 
  Li Peng affirmed: "Good! I have many reasons to believe 
that through the efforts of everyone, we can definitely run 
state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises efficiently. It 
is groundless for some people to correlate state-owned large- 
and medium-sized enterprises with poor economic efficiency." 
  Li Peng left the conference room to view buses of various 
categories which the plant produces. He entered a double-decker 
bus with reclining seats, and asked about its performance and 
price. He also tried the reclining seat and said: "It is very 
comfortable and suitable for long-distance travel. How is the 
market for this type of vehicle?" Li Bingcai, secretary of the 
Yangzhou city party committee, replied: "Supply cannot meet 
demand." The plant happens to be a contact point for Li 
Bingcai, who is very familiar with its operations. 
  Boarding a medium-sized station wagon, Li Peng tried the 
clutch and brake before starting the vehicle. Under the 
premier's control, the "Ya Xing" station wagon moved forward 
slowly, and hearty laughs and applause filled the plant.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "National News </F>
Hookup" program] 
  [Text] While inspecting the social order situation in 
Hebei Province's rural areas 18-20 May, Luo Gan, state 
councillor and secretary general of the State Council, stressed: 
Leaders at various levels must properly handle the relations 
among reform, development, and stability and must list the tasks 
on maintaining stability in their work schedule. While carrying 
out economic construction, they should also simultaneously 
handle tasks on maintaining stability. Nationwide stability 
mainly depends on rural stability. Once the rural areas are 
stable, the whole country will be stable. [video shows Luo Gan, 
accompanied by unidentified local rural leaders, visiting and 
inspecting various rural localities and addressing and holding 
talks with different groups of local people] 
  Luo Gan said: Hebei's drive in strictly cracking down on 
various crimes in most of its rural areas has yielded a very 
effective frightening impact. Party and government cadres and 
personnel of political and law commissions at the forefront have 
worked very hard, have made concerted efforts, and have made 
important contributions to safeguarding social stability. 
  Commenting on ways to maintain rural stability, Luo Gan 
pointed out: We should properly handle two events: First, we 
should develop production. Second, we should properly and 
comprehensively manage social order in rural areas. We should 
strengthen the development of grass-roots administration and 
organizations. Once a strong rural leading body is established, 
it will be able to lead the masses to develop the local economy 
and safeguard rural stability. We should let mass autonomous 
organizations, including village self-defense committees [chun 
zi bao hui] play their proper roles; should intensify the 
dissemination of general legal knowledge; and should let the 
broad masses of peasants be more familiar with the law. In 
particular, we should begin teaching youngsters general legal 
knowledge. We should resolve contradictions that arise under 
new historic conditions when they are young and are beginning to 
develop at an early stage. It is necessary to resolve 
contradictions at the grass-roots units. By carrying out 
comprehensive management, we should reduce crimes to the lowest 
possible level.

  [Text] Led by Comrade Song Jian, state councillor and 
chairman of the State Council Environmental Protection 
Committee, a Huaihe-bound inspection team organized by the 
National People's Congress [NPC] Environment and Resources 
Committee and the State Council Environmental Protection 
Committee arrived in Henan yesterday morning. The inspection 
team will inspect Henan's environmental protection law 
enforcement work. 
  Yesterday morning, provincial and Zhengzhou City leaders, 
including Li Changchun, Fan Qinchen, Zhong Lisheng, Zhang 
Honghua, and others, briefed the inspection team on Henan's 
environmental protection work, discussed with the team problems 
pertaining to the work, and expressed the hope that the state 
will provide more assistance to Henan in environmental 
protection. 
  After listening to reports made by the Henan leaders, State 
Councillor Song Jian pointed out: Pollution in the Huaihe 
valley has already reached an alarming level. If we fail to 
take effective measures to solve this problem, some tributaries 
of the Huaihe will soon turn into drainage canals. Having 
basically solved the problem of food and clothing for the vast 
majority of the people living along the Huaihe, we should now 
start making every possible effort to help and guide the masses 
in the area to free themselves from a dirty environment. 
Economic development should never harm the environment; rather, 
it should protect the environment. We should work harder, 
redouble our efforts, strive to raise the region's social, 
economic, and environmental efficiencies, gradually formulate 
and enact stricter environmental protection laws, and ensure 
that all environmental protection laws are implemented to the 
letter so as to raise the work of harnessing the Huaihe to a new 
level. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Li Changchun said: As 
Henan is the source of the Huaihe, the Henan comrades should 
adopt a highly responsible attitude toward the people and make 
energetic efforts to further the work of harnessing the Huaihe. 
  Comrade Yang Zhenhuai, vice chairman of the NPC Environment 
and Resources Committee, along with comrades in charge of more 
than 10 state ministries and commissions, also listened to the 
reports made by the Henan leaders. 
  Yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Li Changchun, Zhang 
Deguang, Zhang Honghua, and other provincial and Zhengzhou City 
leaders, Song Jian and his entourage inspected a project built 
for the purpose of harnessing the Qingshuihe [Qingshui Lake] and 
visited Baixian Joint-stock Company Ltd. and Zhongyuan 
Pharmaceutical Factory. 
  At the factory, Comrade Song Jian wrote: "Protect the 
Environment To Benefit This and Coming Generations!"

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Li 
Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and chairman of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], said today that 
reform will benefit the majority, but will not benefit all the 
people at the same time or in the same way. 
  Li made these remarks while meeting with 95 national labor 
models here. 
  On the occasion of the upcoming 1 May International Labor 
Day, Li Ruihuan, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and 
State Council, extended his festive greetings to Chinese 
workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the laboring masses of all 
nationalities. 
  For various reasons, he said, living standards of the staff 
and masses of some departments have not improved remarkably. 
Some have even encountered temporary difficulties. It is quite 
natural for the party and government to show concern for them. 
  Li Ruihuan stated that the trade union serves as a bridge 
linking the CPC with the masses of workers. Trade unions should 
regard as their own duties safeguarding the interests of the 
masses and helping workers resolve difficulties in livelihood, 
frequently go deep into the realities of life, maintain close 
ties with the masses, enthusiastically listen to the voice of 
the masses, know what the masses are thinking, accurately and 
promptly report the situation to the local party and government 
departments, do their utmost to resolve difficulties for the 
masses, meticulously do ideological work well, mitigate 
contradictions, dispel sulky moods, and win the understanding 
and support of the masses. 
  Li Ruihuan once again stressed that China's reform, opening 
up, and modernization program has entered a new stage. China's 
overall situation is characterized by "seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability." He called on China's working class, the 
CPC, and the Chinese Government to share a common fate, serve 
this overall situation, do their own work well in a 
down-to-earth manner, and give full play to their role as a 
"vital force" in economic construction.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lan Ning (5695 0413)] </F>
  [Text] Chengdu, 19 May (XINHUA) -- While inspecting 
Sichuan recently, Qian Qichen, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau, vice premier of the State Council, 
and concurrently minister of foreign affairs, stressed that the 
current international and domestic situations are conducive for 
China to develop its tourism. Localities should take advantage 
of the opportune time to accelerate the development of the 
non-trade industry that creates foreign exchange. Especially, 
we should attach importance to developing and improving tourism 
software. 
  Qian Qichen arrived in Chengdu 15 May. During his stay, he 
attended a national forum of tourism bureau chiefs and heard 
reports by leaders of Sichuan Province and Chengdu city. Later, 
he inspected well-known scenic spots in Sichuan and attended the 
opening ceremony for the 1994 Chinese Cultural Relics and 
Historic Sites Tour of Leshan International Tourism Buddha 
Festival on 18 May. While in Sichuan, Qian Qichen extensively 
exchanged views with Sichuan's leaders and people in charge of 
tourism from various provinces on the current state of and 
prospects for tourism development. 
  Qian Qichen said: China, rich with tourism resources, a long 
history, and a unique cultural tradition, is a great attraction 
to the world. Judging from the current international and 
domestic situations, now is the opportune time to develop 
tourism. Some Western economies are in recession; and the 
political situation in some regions, in chaos; while China, 
developing in a healthy and stable way, has attracted many 
investors. In three years, Hong Kong will be returned to China. 
To tourism, this is a great opportunity. We should seize and 
take advantage of the opportune time. With the launching of 
economic and financial reforms and the establishment of a 
socialist market economy in China, China will surely make great 
headway in developing tourism. 
  Qian Qichen pointed out: Tourism is a comprehensive 
industry. Its development depends on various industries such as 
communications, telecommunications, hotel, and transportation, 
as well as safety. Tourism development will also give an 
impetus to the development of these industries. As an 
outward-oriented industry that creates foreign exchange, tourism 
represents a major nontrade channel from which China earns 
foreign exchange. Statistics show that, from 1978 to 1993, 
foreign exchange income from tourism totalled $32.1 billion, 
becoming a major part of China's foreign exchange earnings from 
nontrade channels. This has laid a good foundation for further 
development. 
  Currently, we should improve software and service quality, 
strengthen safety in travel, and perfect the management system. 
In 1993, China received some 7 million foreigners who toured 
China. Tourism is a good channel for foreigners to get to know 
China. We should leave a good impression on foreign tourists. 
Qian Qichen also hopes that localities should strengthen 
production of tourism commodities and develop China into a 
"shopping paradise" for tourists worldwide. In speaking of 
tourism development in Sichuan, Qian Qichen pointed out: As a 
populated province with abundant tourism resources -- a rare 
favorable condition, Sichuan should concentrate its efforts on 
development, coordination, and service, so as to make good 
progress in tourism. 
  Qian Qichen will inspect other parts of Sichuan on 19 and 20 
May. Accompanying Qian Qichen were He Chunlin, deputy secretary 
general of the State Council General Office, and Liu Yi, 
director of the National Tourism Administration.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Wei Yufeng (7614 3768 7364) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Liu Jun (0491 6511)] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 18 May (XINHUA) -- The on-the-spot 
meeting on conducting education on patriotism at primary and 
secondary schools opened today in Shanghai. The meeting marked 
the taking of the concrete steps and measures to further 
implement the "one guiding principle and four important tasks" 
proposed by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the national work 
conference on propaganda and ideological work. 
  The meeting, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and party's 
basic line, will conscientiously implement the guidelines laid 
down at the national work conference on propaganda and 
ideological work; sum up and exchange experiences gained from 
conducting education on patriotism across the nation in recent 
years; study ways to implement the "Outlines for Implementing 
Education on Patriotism" at primary and secondary schools under 
the new situation; and carry out the education on patriotism at 
primary and secondary schools in an extensive, in-depth, and 
lasting manner. 
  Ding Guangen, member of the CPC Central Committee Political 
Bureau and member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, 
showed great concern for and attached importance to the 
education on patriotism. He heard briefings on the convening of 
the on-the-spot meeting and set forth his demands. State 
Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing sent a congratulatory message to 
the meeting. In the letter, he pointed out that it was 
extremely important to call the on-the-spot meeting on education 
of patriotism at the primary and secondary schools, to sum up 
the rich experiences gained from conducting the education on 
China's contemporary history, on China's current situation, and 
on patriotism in recent years, and to institutionalize and 
persist in the system of conducting education on patriotism in 
the future. This will have a pragmatic significance to 
publicizing the major trend of the times and patriotism among 
the youngsters; to carrying forward China's excellent tradition; 
to promoting the 64-characters on the great enterprising spirit; 
to using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics to arm and educate the youngsters; 
and to training a new generation of people with ideals, 
morality, culture and discipline for the next century. 
  Last year, the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department; 
the State Education Commission; the Ministry of Radio, Cinema, 
and Television; and the Culture Ministry, after summing up 
experiences of conducting education through movies and 
television across the nation, issued a "Circular on Using Good 
Movies and Television Programs To Conduct Education on 
Patriotism at the Nation's Primary and Secondary Schools" and 
launched the activity of showing 100 patriotic and educational 
movies across the nation. The showing of 100 movies was 
welcomed by the broad mass of primary and secondary school 
students, teachers, and parents and obtained excellent social 
effect. Representatives attending the meeting called for 
persisting in this successful experience, for organically 
integrating this successful experience with educational 
planning, and for fully bringing into play the roles of movies 
and television as "lively and three-dimensional teaching 
materials." 
  Liu Bin, vice minister in charge of the State Education 
Commission, spoke on ways of using education on patriotism to do 
a good job on moral education at primary and secondary schools. 
He stressed that education on patriotism is the foundation for 
doing a good job on building socialist spiritual civilization 
and that it is necessary to fully implement the policy of 
stressing the building of socialist spiritual civilization. 
First, he said, it is necessary to do an even better job in 
laying a foundation for education on patriotism and optimize the 
social environment for cultivating the people. Second, in 
addition to turning the schools into places to conduct education 
on patriotism, it is necessary to use such means as movies, 
television, books, magazines, and songs to foster students' 
patriotism. Third, it is necessary to greatly publicize 
advanced models' patriotism, so as to give play to the 
demonstrative and inspirational roles of advanced models. 
Fourth, it is necessary to establish certain protocols and 
rules, just like those displayed by the squad at the Tiananmen 
Square that is responsible for flag- raising ceremony, so as to 
instill patriotism among youngsters. 
  Liu Yunshang, deputy head of the CPC Central Committee 
Propaganda Department, presided over the meeting. Chen Zhili, 
deputy secretary of the Shanghai CPC Committee, attended the 
meeting to greet its opening and comprehensively and 
systematically briefed the participants on the experience of 
conducting education on patriotism at primary and secondary 
schools in Shanghai. 
  The meeting was co-sponsored by the CPC Propaganda 
Department; the State Education Commission; the Ministry of 
Radio, Cinema, and Television; the Culture Ministry; and the 
Communist Youth League Central Committee. Some 150 
representatives and people in charge of relevant departments 
from 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities 
attended.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The China Welfare Fund 
for the Handicapped decided today to donate 500,000 yuan each to 
two national organizations. 
  The decision was made at the 10th meeting of the board of

Youth Volunteers Operation and the China Foundation for Bravery 
Against Crimes. 
  Deng Pufang, the chairman of the Welfare Fund, said 
handicapped people had received generous help from the public, 
and it was their wish to make a contribution to the progress of 
society. 
  The fund for the handicapped was founded on March 15, 1984, 
and has since received 220 million yuan in donations from home 
and abroad. 
  The Fund has in the past decade done a big job in bringing 
better healthcare, creating more opportunities in work and 
education for the handicapped in China, the meeting was told. 
  The meeting also heard the auditor's report on the Fund's 
income and expenditure and approved an amendment to the Fund's 
constitution. 
  The meeting elected Song Ping honorary chairman of the Fund. 
  Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political 
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and 
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese people's 
Political Consultative Conference, and State Councillor Peng 
Peiyun, attended today's meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- China will bring 
electricity supplies within six years to more than 120 million 
farmers living in remote and poverty-stricken areas. 
  All China's counties will get electricity supplies and over 
95 percent of farmers' households are then expected to be 
supplied with electricity, officials said at a meeting here 
today of the Rural Electrification Working Conference, jointly 
sponsored by the State Planning Commission, the State Economic 
and Trade Commission and the Ministry of Electricity Industry. 
  At the meeting, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua urged departments of 
electricity and local governments to cooperate with each other 
in supplying electricity to the farmers through self-reliance 
and by exploiting local resources in the poverty-stricken areas 
so that the local farmers can become prosperous as soon as 
possible. 
  China's rural electrification process achieved remarkable 
progress since the 1960s, sources at the meeting said. By the 
end of 1993, 97 percent of townships, 93 percent of villages and 
89 percent of farmers' households had been able to use 
electricity. 
  Per capita annual electricity consumption for the rural 
population reached 48 kilowatt-hours in 1993, 7.9 times the 
figure for 1978. 
  Many large power stations are supplying electricity to the 
rural areas. Thousands of small thermal or hydro-electric power 
stations have been built, while wind and solar energy are also 
being used. 
  However, there are still 28 counties that have virtually no 
electricity supply. And about 120 million farmers in a dozen 
provinces and autonomous regions, mostly in western China, are 
waiting to get electricity. 
  Officials said that these areas, often sparsely populated, 
are the most difficult to be electrified because they are far 
from the large regional electricity network, their local 
economic growth is slow and local finance tight. 
  According to a blueprint on the electrification of China's 
rural areas in the 1990s which was presented to the meeting by 
the Ministry of Electricity, most of China's poor villages will 
be able to use electricity in the coming few years.

<F P=106> [Report from Hong Kong by staff reporter: "Chinese Central </F>
Authorities Instruct External Propaganda Departments in All 
Localities to Strictly Enforce Regulations on News Covering 
Activities of Reporters From Outside the Mainland"] 
  [Text] Recently, the external propaganda departments in 
all localities received a central instruction on strictly 
enforcing regulations on the news covering activities of 
reporters from outside the mainland. Hong Kong and Macao 
reporters must first be approved by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch 
and invited by local authorities before they can go to the 
mainland to cover relevant news. Reporters not passing such 
procedures must not be received. 
  HSIN PAO was told by officials of the relevant departments 
in 
a number of provinces and municipalities that in the past 
although there were regulations controlling activities of 
reporters from outside the mainland, many provinces and 
municipalities were still willing to receive such reporters and 
arrange news covering activities in order to give broader 
publicity to the local investment environment. The local 
authorities did not care whether the reporters came with the 
approval of the authorities concerned. However, after the Xi 
Yang incident, the external propaganda departments of all 
provinces and municipalities received a central instruction 
which required them to strictly enforce regulations on 
activities of reporters from outside the mainland. Hong Kong 
and Macao reporters should first achieve the approval of the 
XINHUA Hong Kong Branch and the invitation of the local 
authorities before they can cover news inside the mainland. If 
any Hong Kong and Macao reporters conduct news covering without 
such approval, their activities are illegal and must be banned. 
  Mainland officials also indicated that the number of Hong 
Kong and Macao reporters who applied to cover news on the 
mainland recently decreased obviously. In particular, after Xi 
Yang was sentenced to imprisonment, many provinces and 
municipalities received almost no applications to cover news 
from Hong Kong and Macao reporters. 
  As for some Hong Kong reporters' boycott of covering news on 
the mainland, some local officials there said that the Hong Kong 
reporters should not take such action, which would certainly 
affect their future work inside the mainland. In the past, when 
the local governments of the mainland invited Hong Kong 
reporters to cover news, they often named the institutions and 
the reporters being invited. If reporters who were invited 
refused to go or if the mass media organs changed people, the 
mainland institutions that issued the invitations would have to 
seek endorsement from the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch again. Now, 
as some Hong Kong reporters openly signed the boycott statement, 
it is believed that they will be facing more restrictions from 
the mainland authorities concerned in the future if they are 
still invited or if they themselves take the initiative in 
applying to cover news inside the mainland. 
  Officials in some south China cities said that because Hong 
Kong people viewed the case of Xi Yang from an angle different 
from the viewpoint of mainland people, they quite understood why 
Hong Kong reporters signed the boycott statement. However, they 
also hoped that Hong Kong reporters would act more sensibly and 
would not affect their future work. So far, many provinces and 
cities have not received the namelist of the reporters involved 
in the boycott from the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch.

  [Text] Shanghai, 23 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wu Yan-kun, 
a preacher of the Christian Sunday School Association of Taiwan, 
was ordered by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to shorten 
his visit to Shanghai. Wu returned to Taiwan by air today. 
  Wu Yan-kun began his activities in the mainland in 1989, and 
he often visited Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing, and Xian, where he 
distributed his own books, "Great Prediction" and "Full 
Collection of Savior's Messages," and tapes like "Truth of the 
Cross" and "The Revelation" to propagate "God's prediction" that 
"the world's doomsday will be in the year of 2018." He spread 
such heresy as "our days are numbered, so we should commemorate 
the creator in the declining days in order to move onto the path 
leading to paradise." 
  The Shanghai police said that Wu's activities had endangered 
social security and had disrupted the order of normal religious 
activities and had produced certain evil effects.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Recently, 
a book entitled Too Heavy To Call Him Father has 
appeared overseas. It is "a work of fiction in the form of an 
autobiography" that has been copied in turn by several 
newspapers, to the extent that the readers are puzzled. In 
Beijing, an authoritative historian specializing in the history 
of the CPC has read it and said that the story in this fiction 
is a complete fabrication, and the fiction is a vulgar piece of 
work that gains fame by deceiving the public. 
  The author, called "Ai Bei," told a story in her book, 
saying 
that Zhou Enlai had had an extramarital affair with "An Ran," a 
secretary working for the Volunteers. When he knew that "An 
Ran" was pregnant, he insisted on having the baby, and for this 
reason he ran into a "marital crisis" with Deng Yingchao. 
During an interview with the reporters from this news agency, 
the expert, who has spent a long time researching the history of 
the CPC, pointed out that the persons who are familiar with 
China's political environment in the 1950's and those who 
understand Zhou Enlai's political beliefs and daily life, will 
be able to tell immediately that this plot is ridiculous. 
  The expert also said that there was a very rigid security 
system at the senior level of the CPC, and it was virtually 
impossible for Zhou Enlai to freely meet with "An Ran," as the 
book described. If the story in the book were true, then it 
would have been leaked a long time ago. During the Cultural 
Revolution, Jiang Qing and her followers dug three meters deep 
into the ground to collect material to topple Zhou Enlai. If 
there were such a rumor, then why would they not use it? Why 
has no one heard about it before? 
  The expert said that this so-called "work of fiction in the 
form of an autobiography" was a fabricated story, and that this 
point is beyond any doubt. A writer has the freedom of 
creation, but randomly fabricating "an affair" to harm the 
reputation of a late dignitary and to cheat the public is very 
mean and immoral behavior. This person, who calls herself "Ai 
Bei," is in fact not Zhou Enlai's daughter, and her real life 
background will be uncovered by the people one day. By then the 
world will know the truth.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Wei (2621 0251): "Deng Pufang Pledges To </F>
Ensure the Supply of Sufficient Food and Clothing to Disabled 
People in China by the Turn of the Century"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Deng Pufang, 
director in chief of the China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped, 
talked this afternoon about the general development goal of 
services for the handicapped in China by the turn of the 
century. As far as the efforts to satisfy disabled people's 
subsistence needs are concerned, he said, our goal is to narrow 
the gap between the standard of services for the disabled and 
the economic and social development level, to give the disabled 
more opportunities for social involvement and to expand the 
scope of involvement, to enable them to achieve 
self-improvement, and to improve their living conditions. 
  Deng Pufang specified this general goal as follows: 
  --To solve the problems regarding the supply of sufficient 
food and clothing to the disabled. 
  --To raise both the employment rate for disabled people in 
urban areas and the at-work rate for disabled people in rural 
areas to about 80 percent. 
  --To raise the compulsory education enrollment rate for 
disabled children to 80 percent; and to provide vocational 
training to about 80 percent of job-awaiting disabled people. 
  --To assist most disabled people in undergoing 
rehabilitation 
training in their own neighborhoods or at home; and to start 
some urgent and effective rehabilitation projects with a view to 
rehabilitating about 2 million disabled people. 
  --To enrich disabled people's cultural life. 
  --To promote preventive efforts to eliminate the main 
factors 
leading to disability. 
  Deng Pufang talked on this topic during the 10th meeting of 
the board of directors of the China Welfare Fund for the 
Handicapped held this afternoon. 
  He also noted that the services for the disabled in China 
should be guided by the following principles in the future: 1) 
To comprehensively enforce the Law on the Protection of Disabled 
Persons; 2) to implement the development guideline of "stressing 
real effects and laying down a solid foundation"; to focus on 
efforts that can meet disabled people's urgent needs, benefit a 
large part of the disabled population, and promise rapid results 
and good effects; and to further develop a sound operational and 
working system, a sound system of policies, laws, and 
regulations, and a sound infrastructure system for services for 
disabled people; 3) to adhere to the working principle of 
"socialized services"; and 4) to give full play to the 
initiative of disabled people and to the role of organizations 
of disabled people, so as to enhance the spirit of 
self-strengthening among disabled people. 
  The tasks facing Deng Pufang and his colleagues, one should 
say, are not easy, because quite a lot of difficulties have yet 
to be solved regarding services for disabled people in China, 
even though many achievements have been scored in recent years. 
The illiteracy rate among the disabled population remains as 
high as about 60 percent, nearly 80 percent of blind, deaf, or 
mentally retarded children stay out of school, 40 percent of 
disabled people are jobless, and most disabled people have no 
access to rehabilitation or medical facilities. However, as 
Deng Pufang put it at the board of directors meeting today: "We 
certainly can do a good job so long as we mobilize all sectors 
of the community to join our efforts, and work in a 
down-to-earth and creative manner."

of the National Meeting on Propaganda and Ideological Work, many 
prominent and gratifying changes have taken place on our press 
front. In response to Comrade Jiang Zemin's call, many 
journalists have studied hard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. On the other 
hand, they have gone deep into the realities of life for 
interviews and investigations and have written a number of good 
press reports portraying new achievements and experiences in 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization as well as the 
valuable mental attitude of the laborers. An inspiring trend 
has appeared in "using correct public opinion to guide the 
people." 
  To undertake the heavy task entrusted by the party and the 
people in a more proper manner, journalists should make further 
efforts to "go deep." Into what should they "go deep?" First, 
they should go deep into the realities of life. In other words, 
they should leave their offices and confront the fiery realities 
of life, instead of just sitting in the editorial room listening 
to feedback reports, reading material, or editing manuscripts. 
Second, they should go to the grass roots, namely the rural 
areas, factories, shops, schools, armed forces units, 
neighborhoods, and other basic-level units, instead of only 
visiting leadership institutions. Third, they should stay among 
the masses. In other words, they should frequently contact or 
interview ordinary workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres, as 
well as officers and soldiers at the grass-roots level, to know 
if they are happy or sad and to listen to their appeals, instead 
of only reporting on local or departmental leaders, factory 
directors, or managers. Filing anecdotes about singing or film 
stars is even less recommended. Fourth, they should go deep 
into the "focus" of society. In other words, they should 
meticulously investigate crucial problems involving reform, 
development, and the stability of the situation, as well as hot 
issues in society about which the masses have complained 
strongly; they should make penetrating judgments instead of 
filing commonplace reports. 
  "Going deep" is an essential demand of our party in 
exercising leadership over socialist journalism. Only by "going 
deep," can journalists: Accurately find out about the real 
situation at every social stratum; promptly grip the pulse of 
the era; provide valuable information for leading institutions 
to formulate up correct policies; form links with the masses and 
serve them; file excellent reports and help foster talented 
people; and only by "going deep," can our journalism take deep 
root in the fertile soil of the people, yield good results, and 
last for a long time. In short, only by "going deep," can our 
journalists make due contributions to the great cause of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  In "going deep," not only must journalists make a "physical 
appearance" but, more importantly, they should also be "mentally 
engaged." They should cherish a genuine intention to and a 
strong demand on "going deep." If they make a physical 
appearance in the grass roots and among the masses without their 
minds being engaged, this type of "going deep" does not mean 
much, nor will it produce good results. To be "mentally 
engaged," first, they should solidly cultivate the idea of 
serving the people and socialism. Which people to serve is a 
fundamental question, the settlement of which will provide a 
basis for "going deep." Second, journalists should have the 
spirit of hard struggle. Conditions are generally arduous in 
grass-roots units, particularly in some remote regions, old 
revolutionary base areas, ethnic areas, and poor areas. Before 
going to these places, journalists should be mentally prepared 
for a tough life. Third, they should resolutely oppose and 
resist the temptation of "compensatory press reports." For a 
time in the past, "compensatory press reports" were prevalent 
and corrupted the minds of some journalists. How could they go 
deep into the realities of life or stay among the masses? This 
was a tragedy for the journalists. Greater efforts should be 
made to stop this evil practice from recurring. 
  In the last few months, many fraternal press units have used 
their brains and worked out ideas on "going deep" and they have 
introduced many good columns and programs and published many 
good articles. RENMIN RIBAO and RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION 
have also made some efforts in this respect and achieved certain 
results, which have been confirmed by the readers. But there is 
still room for improvement. Facts prove that to do a better and 
more brilliant job in "going deep," the crux is that press unit 
leaders should have a strong sense of "going deep," draw up an 
excellent plan regarding "going deep," and work out practical 
measures for "going deep." Moreover, they should act as a good 
example in "going deep." Of course, press agency directors and 
chief editors are not like ordinary editors or reporters. Their 
main task is to give consideration to the overall work and 
drawing up an overall plan, instead of filing press reports. 
However, when necessary, they should also "play an exemplary 
role." This is quite beneficial. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin proposed the following to journalists: 
"Study, study, and study further; go deep, go deep, and go 
deeper." These 14-character instructions point out the path for 
journalists to grow healthily and should thus become a motto for 
editors and reporters. We should take the achievements already 
made in our study and going deep as a new departure point to 
exert ourselves and blaze a new trail in journalism!

  [Excerpt] Chengdu, 24 May (XINHUA) -- The officers and men 
of a certain division in the Chengdu Military Region have 
seriously studied and implemented the party's nationality 
policy, promoted unity within and outside the division, and 
advanced all aspects of army building, social stability, and 
social progress through unity among various nationalities. 
During a meeting with the officers and men, Jiang Zemin, 
chairman of the Central Military Commission, encouraged them to 
serve as models of nationality unity, as well as staunch 
defenders of the motherland. 
  The division is stationed in a minority area. Approximately 
half of the troops are minority nationalities. In light of this 
situation, the division party committee has, over the years, 
carried out education about the party's nationality policy among 
the troops, fostering a heartening atmosphere of mutual respect, 
mutual assistance, and close unity between officers and men, as 
well as among comrades-in-arms, who have made joint 
contributions to army building. The troops have always been the 
forerunners in conducting military training, performing duties 
related to combat readiness, and carrying out other missions; 
they have always been models of internal unity. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- Speaking today at a 
rotating training class in Volume 3 of the Selected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping, attended by division-level leading cadres 
of the General Logistics Department, Fu Quanyou, member of the 
Central Military Commission and director of the General 
Logistics Department, emphatically said: In studying Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, it is 
imperative to make unremitting efforts and persevere in 
integrating theory with practice and in putting what one has 
learned to good use, to achieve results in pushing forward the 
reform and construction of the Army's logistic work. 
  Fu Quanyou pointed out: Since the beginning of this year, 
the party committee of the General Logistics Department has paid 
attention to its central group's study programs. It has 
sponsored two rotating training classes for division-level 
leading cadres. Meanwhile, various units have sponsored more 
than 70 rotating training classes for regiment-level cadres. 
The overall result of these training classes is good. But we 
should have a sober understanding that such an effort is just a 
beginning. Only by studying continuously can we adapt to the 
new situation and meet the requirements of our tasks. We must 
persist in carrying out Chairman Jiang Zemin's important 
instruction: "Constantly and repeatedly study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and put it on top of 
the agenda." 
  Fu Quanyou said: The most outstanding feature of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the high degree of integration of its 
scientific nature with its practical nature. In studying Volume 
3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, we must 
achieve results in solving practical problems. First of all, in 
the light of the overall situation of the party's work, we must 
have a profound understanding of the relations between "reform, 
development, and stability"; strengthen our 
self-conscientiousness in carrying out the general goal; and 
resolutely follow the instructions of the CPC Central Committee 
and Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the 
core so as to better ensure the reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive. Secondly, in the light of realities in the 
market and on the battlefield, it is necessary to apply Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the ideology of Army-building in the new 
period to guide practical logistics work. It is imperative to 
emancipate the mind, blaze new trails, and work hard to meet the 
requirements of modern war and the market economy so as to 
achieve the goal of "being assured of adequate logistical 
support." Third, in the light of ideological realities, it is 
necessary to guide the broad masses of officers and soldiers to 
self-conscientiously improve their world outlook; resist the 
corrosion of various corruptive thoughts; firmly keep in mind 
the ideal of serving the people wholeheartedly; maintain the 
glorious tradition of the old revolutionary Army; carry forward 
the "five kinds of revolutionary spirits" [wu zhong ge ming jing 
shen 0063 4429 7245 0730 4737 4377] advocated by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping; the "64-character pioneering spirit" [emancipate the 
mind, seek truth from facts, actively explore new ways, dare to 
innovate, work hard, press forward in the face of difficulties, 
learn from foreign countries, constantly improve ourselves, be 
modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, work 
together as one, have national interest in mind, be diligent and 
frugal, be upright and honest, work vigorously to make the 
country prosperous, and serve selflessly] advocated by Comrade 
Jiang Zemin; and strive to carry out a socialist new moral and 
work style. 
  Fu Quanyou urged leading cadres at all levels to take the 
lead in studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping and, through studying, to strengthen their 
dedication to the work and their sense of responsibility, 
maintain integrity, foster a good image, and strive to enhance 
their leading skills and ability to have the situation well in 
mind. 
  Zhou Keyu, political commissar of the General Logistics 
Department, also spoke at the meeting on how to study Volume 3 
of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.

3419 2052): "While Inspecting Troops, PLA Logistics Department 
Director Fu Quanyou Calls for Persisting in Rigorous Troops 
Management and More Effective Logistical Support"] 
  [Text] Wuhan, 28 April (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--Today, when 
inspecting a military unit in Wuhan, Fu Quanyou, member of the 
Central Military Commission and director of the General 
Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army [PLA], 
required the logistics units to follow the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and building the armed forces in the new period, 
to carry out Chairman Jiang's general instruction of "measuring 
up to standards politically, mastering military skills 
perfectly, keep the fine style of work, enforcing discipline 
strictly, and ensuring logistical support effectively," to 
effect rigorous troop management, to build and manage strategic 
warehouses according to high standards and with good quality, to 
properly manage strategic materials, to improve supplies for the 
troops, and to comprehensively enhance the troops' fast reaction 
capacity and strategic support capacity. 
  Fu Quanyou said: To effect rigorous troop management, we 
should first give top priority to the work of enhancing the 
political and ideological integrity of the troops; closely link 
study of the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping 
with the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, with 
the study of Chairman Jiang's important speeches and the 
principles and policies laid down by the party Central Committee 
and the Central Military Commission, and with the study of the 
theories and basic knowledge about the socialist market economy; 
link such studies with the thinking and routine work of the 
troops; enhance the consciousness and firmness of officers and 
servicemen in carrying out the party's basic line; keep a high 
degree of uniformity ideologically and politically, and act in 
unison with the party Central Committee and the Central Military 
Commission; and firmly obey the orders of the party Central 
Committee and the Central Military Commission with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core at any time and in any circumstances. It is 
necessary to strictly enforce discipline and take this as the 
central link in routine troop management. Routine troop 
management should be combined with routine ideological work. 
Resolute action should be taken to correct the loose and lax 
conditions in troop management, discipline enforcement, and the 
work style of the troops. Troops must act strictly according to 
orders and instructions issued by the upper commanders. Leading 
organs and officers must set a good example for their 
subordinates and men in this regard so that "iron units" in the 
logistics front will be created. The behavior of the troops 
must be strictly brought into line with the relevant orders, 
rules, and regulations so that a regular and orderly condition 
can be established in war preparations, training, routine work, 
and daily lives. Management of war materials must be 
strengthened, construction and management of infrastructural 
facilities must be improved, good state of war preparations 
should be kept for all types of materials, guarantees should be 
made that necessary materials and equipment will be delivered to 
the right places as soon as the orders are received, and efforts 
should be made to ensure implementation of the "Program for the 
Building of Grass-Roots Units." Fulfillment of all tasks for 
the logistical organs will eventually be dependent on the work 
of the grass-roots units. Party committees and commanding 
organs at all levels should, according to the "Program for the 
Building of Grass-Roots Units" and Chairman Jiang's five-point 
general requirement, regularize and guide the work of 
grass-roots units, attach importance to their work, concentrate 
attention on their work, guarantee various services for them, 
improve the ability of the grass-roots party branches to 
exercise comprehensive leadership, help grass-roots cadres 
command their men, and improve the material and cultural lives 
of officers and men so that a solid foundation can be laid for 
troop building. 
  Fu Quanyou emphatically pointed out: Party committees and 
leading organs at various levels of the logistical front should, 
according to the instructions of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and 
Chairman Jiang, give education to cadres and soldiers with 
regard to outlook on life, values, and morals in connection with 
new conditions and problems; deepen education in patriotism, 
collectivism, and revolutionary heroism; effectively carry out 
the activities of "loving the valleys, loving the warehouses, 
and loving the work posts;" extensively carry out the activities 
of emulating such heroic figures as Lei Feng and Xu Honggang; 
guide officer and men to carry forward the "five revolutionary 
spirits" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the 
"64-character pioneering spirit" advocated by Chairman Jiang, to 
willingly resist the corrosive influence of the decadent 
ideology, and to make themselves revolutionary soldiers meeting 
the "four requirements." 
  Zhou Youliang, deputy director of the General Logistics 
Department, accompanied Fu Quanyou to inspect the work of the 
military unit in Wuhan.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Exercise Strict Management Over </F>
Armed Forces"] 
  [Text] In strengthening management over the armed forces, 
there is quite an important point to stress: Management work 
must proceed in accordance with the principle of being strict 
with the armed forces, and style and discipline improvement must 
be taken as the key issue. 
  Exercising strict management over the armed forces and 
strengthening discipline are ancient yet realistic issues. We 
say these are ancient issues because all philosophers and 
far-sighted militarists in the past stressed that "discipline is 
the lifeblood of the armed forces" and explained the basic law 
of armed forces formation from different perceptions. We say 
they are realistic issues because our armed forces are in a 
period of peace and are experiencing the test of reform in the 
great tide of economic construction. The prolonged peaceful 
environment and colorful social phenomena are affecting the 
armed forces through various channels and are causing soldiers 
to slacken their vigilance and loosen their discipline. In 
recent years, the class status of personnel in the armed forces 
has changed a lot. Soldiers had different qualifications before 
they joined the armed forces and cadres and soldiers have many 
employment options after demobilization. All these affect their 
minds, concepts, and behavior. There are all sorts of frictions 
between an open society and the armed forces' strict 
disciplinary restrictions and authority. Therefore, some 
comrades mistakenly think that since the state has implemented 
many open policies, it is no longer necessary for the armed 
forces to exercise strict management. Guided by this idea, some 
units have lowered their criteria and requirements for 
implementing discipline, and some have even taken the wrong 
approach of "counteracting" the higher authorities' regulations, 
decrees, and rules. As a result, some units have relaxed their 
management and slackened their style and discipline. This 
situation suggests that the more peaceful the environment and 
the more open the policy, the more necessary it is for the armed 
forces to exercise strict management. This is an objective 
demand for the improvement of the armed forces in peacetime. 
  In exercising strict management over the armed forces in 
this 
new situation, officers and soldiers of the entire armed forces 
should cultivate this clear idea: Discipline must be enforced 
to the letter and acting willfully is not permissible. 
Discipline is a behavior rule all members of the armed forces 
must strictly observe and is an indispensable condition for the 
armed forces to survive. As special armed organizations, only by 
observing strict discipline can the armed forces shape their 
personnel and complicated equipment into a strong combat 
collective and build individual and scattered forces into a 
powerful entity. The Chinese Army's Disciplinary Orders 
explicitly point out: "Under all circumstances, all soldiers 
must strictly abide by discipline, and no violations of 
discipline whatsoever are allowed." We may say that a basic 
demand on soldiers is strictly and thoroughly implementing 
discipline. Our armed forces must be able to stand the test of 
a prolonged peaceful environment and must always preserve the 
Red Army's tradition of being strict in discipline; at no time 
should they slacken their vigilance. 
  Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin stressed: 
"Strict management must be exercised over the armed forces. It 
is necessary to use orders and regulations to standardize the 
armed forces' behavior." In exercising strict management over 
the armed forces, it is necessary to strictly implement orders 
and regulations to strictly implement discipline and to strictly 
apply the principle of reward and punishment. Orders and 
regulations are the codes for exercising strict management over 
the armed forces and serve as the basis for implementing 
discipline. Whatever situations appear in armed forces 
management in this new period, we must unflinchingly implement 
orders and regulations; use orders and regulations to 
standardize officers' and soldiers' words and deeds, as well as 
units' war preparedness, training, work, and life order; and 
cultivate officers' and soldiers' concepts about orders and 
regulations, as well as their mentality of obeying orders. All 
commanders and soldiers in the armed forces are equal before 
orders and regulations. In implementing discipline, "the higher 
level should set a good example for the lower level to follow," 
and the practice of "counteracting the policies of the higher 
authorities" must be overcome to ensure the smooth relay of 
government and military orders. 
  Strict management will yield good results and loose 
management will cause faults. As long as all armed forces units 
use orders and regulations to train officers and soldiers in 
strictly observing organizational discipline and following 
orders and prohibitions, this glorious People's Army of ours 
will establish stricter discipline, cultivate a fine style, and 
create the brilliant image of a majestic and civilized army.

Chunlin (7456 2504 2651): "All-Army Production and Operation 
Rectification and Reform Work Are Being Carried Out 
Comprehensively"] 
  [Text] The Army-wide production and operation are being 
reformed and reorganized as planned by the Central Military 
Commission (CMC). Led by leading officers from the three 
People's Liberation Army [PLA] general departments, the five 
joint working groups organized by the three PLA general 
departments and the CMC General Office headed for various major 
military units a few days ago to check up on the work and 
provide guidance. This is an important step by the leading 
group for reforming and reorganizing all-Army production and 
operation to implement the policy-decision made by the CMC to 
shake up the Army's production and operation. 
  A meeting on Army-wide production and operation was held in 
November last year. The CMC demanded that centralized and 
unified control be exercised over production and operation 
throughout the Army, that offices at all levels never go into 
commercial production, that fighting troops do a good job in 
agricultural and sideline production and non-fighting troops in 
running industry, and that institutions such as hospitals, 
warehouses, and scientific research institutes provide pay 
services to society while fulfilling their work quotas. For 
this purpose, the CMC further provided that the functions of 
military units be separated from those of the enterprise and 
that a separate system of production and operation be set up. 
In addition, the CMC worked out policies and rules to 
facilitate the reform and reorganization of production and 
operation throughout the Army. After the meeting, various major 
military units completed the tasks of mobilizing officers and 
men and making preparations for the campaign, and they began to 
put the CMC's decisions into practice early this year. 
  The joint working groups will primarily check up on the 
preparation for and the process of the reform and reorganization 
work, will understand whether various units' programs for 
implementing the CMC decisions and their work plan have been 
brought into line with the provisions laid down by the three PLA 
general departments and their realities, will find out how the 
reorganization work has been done, including the number, assets, 
and receivable and payable debts of the enterprises whose stocks 
and assets have been reappraised or those that have closed down, 
suspended operation, amalgamated with others, switched to the 
manufacture of other products, or severed ties with local 
enterprises. The groups will also find out how the general 
departments and various major military units have exercised 
centralized and unified control over production and operation 
and how the fighting troops have sorted out and turned over 
their production and operation projects. 
  Before the joint working groups set out on the journey, Fu 
Quanyou, head of the leading group for reforming and

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Major Move To Strengthen the Ranks of </F>
Officers"] 
  [Text] The "Amended Active Service Regulations Governing 
Active Duty Officers of Chinese People's Liberation Army" and 
the "Amended Regulations on the Military Ranks of Chinese PLA 
Officers" have been deliberated and approved at the seventh 
meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress Standing 
Committee and decreed for implementation by PRC President Jiang 
Zemin. This is a major move to suit the new situation in state 
and army reform and construction, to further improve the command 
and management systems of our Army, and to strengthen the ranks 
of officers in the new situation. It is bound to exercise a 
positive, far-reaching influence in promoting the drive to 
revolutionize, modernize, and standardized the Army. 
  The "Regulations on the Military Ranks of Officers" and the 
"Active Service Regulations Governing Active Duty Officers" were 
implemented as of 1 July 1988 and 1 January 1989 respectively. 
Since their implementation, they have played a positive role in 
straightening out the work relationship of cadres and in 
improving the quality and maintaining the stability of cadre 
ranks. On the whole, they have been applicable. With the 
development in state and army reform and construction, there 
have been many new developments in cadre work and the building 
of cadre ranks, and there have been considerable changes in the 
composition and structure of officer ranks. For this reason, 
some provisions in the two "Regulations" can no longer 
completely suit the needs of the new situation and tasks. In 
the past two years, the Central Military Commission has 
reaffirmed and formulated many important policies and provisions 
on cadre work, and some of them need to be defined in the 
"Regulations." Under the direct leadership of the military 
commission, by extensively listening to the views of leaders at 
all levels and all kinds of cadres, conducting full 
investigation and appraisal, and properly drawing on the 
experience of foreign armies and local authorities, we have 
adjusted and supplemented some articles in the two 
"Regulations." The two amended "Regulations" are more 
compatible with the objective law governing the building of 
officer ranks in peace time and the need of our Army building in 
the new period. 
  In amending the two "Regulations," we have persisted in 
taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea on army building in the new 
period and the relevant instructions of the party Central 
Committee and the Central Military Commission as the basis, 
proceeded from the actual situation in our Army, and set our 
eyes on further advancing the cause of making our ranks of 
officers more revolutionary, younger in average age, better 
educated, and more professionally competent. The two 
"Regulations" have the following features: First, they 
conscientiously carry out the series of instructions of the 
party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on 
cadre work in the new period and reflect the fine traditions of 
our party and our Army in cadre work. Before and after the 14th 
CPC National Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a lot of 
brilliant expositions on Army cadre work and the building of 
Army cadre ranks. In line with the needs of the situation and 
tasks and the reality of the building of Army leading bodies, 
the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core have further defined many 
important principles of cadre work in the new period and adopted 
a series of practical measures. As a result, acute problems in 
cadre work that have existed for some time have been 
satisfactorily solved and new achievements and progress have 
been made in the building of our cadre ranks. These have been 
fully reflected in the two amended "Regulations" and made the 
basic principles in the "Regulations" which must be observed in 
cadre work more complete. Second, we set our eyes on improving 
the age pattern of cadre ranks and thus provide an institutional 
guarantee for the normal replacement of old cadres by the new in 
leading bodies. The work of selecting and promoting outstanding 
young cadres and solving the question of successors has a 
bearing on the long-term construction of the Army and the 
lasting political stability of the country. The amended 
"Regulations" have made proper adjustments to the tenure of some 
officers and the maximum age of active duty officers. Thus, 
conditions are created for the smooth growth of outstanding 
young cadres and the echelon formation of leading body members. 
Third, the two "Regulations" have further defined the post 
duties of officers and straightened out the chain of command. 
In line with the post duties of officers, the amended 
"Regulations on the Military Ranks of Officers" have laid 
emphasis on revising the table of organization [T/O] ranks for 
various posts, changing the T/O ranks for the posts of military 
commission member, chief of staff, and director of the General 
Political Department from two to one, the T/O ranks for regular 
military region posts down to deputy division-level posts from 
three to two, and abolishing the base military ranks [ji zhun 
jun xian 1015 0402 6511 6902]. Fourth, the two "Regulations" 
have, as far as possible, taken into account the immediate 
interests of officers, which is conductive to increasing the 
cohesiveness of the troops. In recent years, the party Central 
Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military 
Commission have adopted a series of measures to solve some 
practical problems among military cadres. While retaining the 
previously stipulated benefits, the amended "Regulations" have 
added some new content. The readjustments of T/O ranks for some 
professional and technical officers, in particular, have further 
demonstrated the principle of "respecting knowledge and talents." 
  The "Active Service Regulations Governing Active Duty 
Officers" and the "Regulations on the Military Ranks of 
Officers" are two basic rules governing the cadre work of our 
Army. All cadres should grasp their implementation with a 
positive, conscientious attitude. It is necessary to take the 
two "Regulations" as basic teaching materials and conduct 
restudy of and reeducation in cadre policies and regulations so 
that the vast numbers of cadres can gain a profound 
understanding of the great significance of amending and 
implementing the "Regulations," master the basic content, and 
bring their ideas into line with the policy decisions of the 
military commission and the spirit of the "Regulations." It is 
necessary to conscientiously subordinate ourselves to the 
overall interest and correctly approach individual interest. 
The amendment of the two "Regulations" shows that we have not 
only proceeded from the overall interest of the state and army 
building, but also taken into account the immediate interests of 
officers. Due to the constraints of many factors, some 
individual desires cannot be satisfied. Through propaganda, 
education, and thoroughgoing and painstaking ideological work, 
the vast numbers of cadres should be made to correctly 
understand the rationality and scientific nature of the 
"Regulations" from the needs of the overall situation, to have a 
stronger sense of dedication and responsibility, and to mobilize 
their work zeal. In the course of implementation, party 
committees at all levels should, in line with the requirements 
of the "Regulations" and in conjunction with the actual 
situations of their own units, make overall plans and consider 
the building of cadre ranks in their own units. Attention 
should be paid to an overall understanding and correct 
implementation of all policies and provisions in the 
"Regulations"; we should not oversimplify them nor should we 
attend to too many things at the same time, or stress one aspect 
but neglect another. Since the two "Regulations" are legislated 
and promulgated by the state's highest organ of power, they 
should be implemented resolutely. Party committees and 
political organs at all levels must further enhance their 
awareness of the need to observe the rules, act in strict 
accordance with the "Regulations," safeguard the inviolability 
and authority of the "Regulations," and ensure their smooth 
implementation. In short, we must study, publicize, and 
implement well the two amended "Regulations," constantly raise 
military competence, political quality, and scientific and 
educational levels of the ranks of officers, and push ahead the 
drive to revolutionize, modernize, and standardize our Army.

  [Text] China would like the economy to expand by just 
seven to eight percent this year, although the forecast growth 
is eight to 9.5 percent, a vice-minister says. Zheng Silin, of 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation 
(MOFTEC), said China's infrastructure and financial resources 
simply could not sustain the rapid economic growth of the past 
two years. The economy grew 13.4 percent last year and 13.2 
percent in 1992. 
  In a meeting with the Chinese Manufacturers' Association, Mr 
Zheng said the double-digit growth had resulted in a severe 
shortage of raw materials and funds in the country and had 
spawned high inflation. But he said the macro-economic 
adjustment package implemented in the second half of last year 
had proved effective in reining in growth, adding that there 
were signs that the economy and booming property prices had been 
slowing down since March. 
  Figures released by the State Planning Commission last week 
showed that the economy grew 12.7 percent in the first four 
months down from 13.9 percent a year ago. Based on these 
figures, the commission predicted economic growth in the first 
half of the year would be 12 percent. Extrapolating on this, 
the economy should grow by no more than eight per cent for the 
rest of the year if China wanted to keep annual economic growth 
to less than 10 percent this year. 
  Mr Zheng also said yesterday the next stage of China's 
economic expansion would be hampered if it failed to speed up 
growth in the inner regions, where energy and raw materials were 
concentrated. As a result, the central authorities were working 
out a stratgy to attract foreign capital to help develop the 
poorer region. As part of the strategy, China for the first 
time singled out the inner provinces to take part in the 
four-day trade and investment fair organised by MOFTEC, which 
ends in Hong Kong today.

  [Text] Shanghai, 5 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Hong Hu, 
vice minister of the State Commission for Restructuring Economic 
System, talked recently about the issue of establishing a modern 
Chinese enterprise system in Shanghai. He said that a modern 
enterprise system is an enterprise system with Chinese 
characteristics. Modern technology and management methods can 
be introduced from other countries, but the modern enterprise 
system cannot be introduced from other countries. It is 
necessary to proceed from China's own national conditions, fully 
absorb and adopt things of universal character in this country, 
and make explorations and creations according to successful 
experience. 
  Hong Hu said: China's modern enterprise system should take 
public ownership as the mainstay, with various economic elements 
developing together; take the distribution of income according 
to work as the main form, with various forms of distribution 
existing side by side; and ensure the role of party 
organizations and workers' democratic management. 
  He pointed out that the modern enterprise system is the 
orientation of enterprise reform under different ownership 
systems, but it is mainly the orientation of the state-owned 
enterprises. 
  Hong Hu said that the modern enterprise system is an 
enterprise system under the socialist market economic structure, 
but it is not the only enterprise system. 
  Hong Hu said: A modern enterprise system is the foundation 
of the structure of China's market. According to the essential 
requirements of the modern enterprise system, reform should 
mainly be carried out by governments, but enterprises also have 
to do a great deal themselves.

<F P=106> [By Geng Jun (5105 6511): "Changes in the Functions, </F>
Organizational Structure, and Personnel Composition of the State 
Planning Commission"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 9 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--New changes 
have been made in the functions, the organizational structure, 
and the personnel composition of the State Planning Commission, 
which also has the reputation of being the "general staff 
headquarters" of the State Council in the management of the 
national economy. 
  The State Council recently approved the "Scheme for Changing 
the Functions, the Internal Structure, and the Personnel 
Composition of the State Planning Commission," which was 
formulated through careful consideration over more than one year. 
  The State Planning Commission originally had 24 subordinate 
departments and bureaus. If the part being merged into the 
State Administration of Commodity Prices is included, there were 
33 departments and bureaus. According to the new scheme, in the 
future, the State Planning Commission will have only 22 
functional departments, including the General Office, the Policy 
Research Office, the Long-Term Planning and Industrial Policy 
Department, the National Economic Comprehensive Management 
Department, the Regional Land Management Department, the Science 
and Technology Department, the Department for Investment in 
Fixed Assets, the Department for Use of Foreign Funds, the 
Finance and Banking Department, the Key Construction Department, 
the Department for Comprehensive Use of Raw Materials and 
Resources, the Department for Mechanical, Electrical, Light, and 
Textile Industries, the Department for Rural Economy, the 
Department for Price Supervision and Inspection, the Department 
for Market and Price Regulation and Control, the Price 
Management Department, the Foreign Economic and Trade 
Department, and the Social Development Department. The number 
of personnel in the State Planning Commission will be reduced 
from more than 1,500 to 919. 
  After the structural reform, the State Planning Commission 
will remain the highest-ranking department for the comprehensive 
management of the national economy within the State Council. 
Its functions will be strengthened in the following aspects: 
Considering and formulating the long-term and intermediate-term 
plans and major policies for national economic and social 
development; forecasting, monitoring, analyzing the trends in 
the operation of the national economy and announcing major 
economic information; considering and arranging the distribution 
of major productive forces and the development of local 
economies, supervising the implementation of such arrangements, 
and coordinating things in this regard; exercising comprehensive 
and coordinated employment of such economic levers as financial 
appropriation and credit arrangements in order to strengthen 
macrocontrol over the national economy; supervising and 
controlling the overall price level in the whole country; and 
guiding the state reserves of major products and major 
production materials that have a vital bearing on the national 
economy and the people's livelihood. 
  The new scheme defines 11 [as received] functions of the 
State Planning Commission. That is, giving advice; maintaining 
the balance; adjusting and controlling the market; guaranteeing 
the projects; studying the strategy; and formulating policies. 
In the future, the State Planning Commission will base its work 
on the development of the market economy, will make up for the 
deficiencies of the market economy, and will guide, foster, and 
control the market. Therefore, it will play a more important 
role in the state's macroeconomic control.

<F P=106> [Special article by Fan Gang (2868 4854): "Speedy Growth </F>
and Macrostability -- A Theoretical Analysis of Macroeconomic 
Issues"] 
  [Text] Abstract: The fast growth of our national economy 
during the past two years has been basically healthy and the 
overheating problem has not developed into such a severe state 
as to require an overall austerity policy. The increase in the 
price index was mainly caused by the expansion of aggregate 
demand. During the economic transformation period, in the course 
of structural reform, inflation tends to be inevitable. 
However, the fact that inflation has not caused big problems in 
the past does not mean that "inflation is harmless." The 
structural reform is a process which takes quite some time to 
show any effects, while macroregulation and control are an issue 
of short-term "management of aggregate demand." Those two must 
not be confused. Therefore, the formula of "currently seeking 
macrostability by way of deepening the reform" is a specious 
argument. Only the formula of "seeking long-term economic 
stability by way of deepening the reform" is correct. Some 
reform measures in use at the moment are confined to the area of 
state-owned economy. Therefore, the reform of the 
macromanagement system should go beyond the vision of 
state-owned economy. [end abstract] 
  In 1993, our country's economic growth rate was 13 percent, 
higher than in 1992. In the meantime, the general price index 
also registered a fast growth. Judged by the factors in various 
areas at the moment, the economic growth in 1994 will continue 
to maintain a relatively high rate and great potential 
inflationary pressures remain. In this context, how to view the 
current state of our economic system and the tendency in 
economic development, whether or not necessary measures should 
be adopted, and how to maintain macroeconomic stability 
alongside high-rate economic growth and truly realize sustained, 
rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu, jiankang] development are 
obviously important questions we have to answer. 
<H5>  Correctly Evaluate the Extra Fast Growth During the Past Two </H5>
Years 
  The first thing to point out here is that it is 
inappropriate 
to draw a simple analogy between the growth rate and inflation 
rate in 1992-1993 and the situation in 1987-1988. The high 
growth in the past two years has been, to a greater extent, 
"real [zhenshi 4176 1395]," healthy [jiankang 0256 1660], and 
nonoverheating [fei guore 7236 6665 3583]. 
  First, during the prior three-year improvement and 
rectification, there were quite a lot of goods in stock, the 
scope of investment was relatively small, and some additional 
social production capacity was created (including, in 
particular, that created by some newly commissioned construction 
projects). While the high growth in 1992 was of a recovery 
nature, the 1993 high growth was still based on the increase of 
social production capacity during the previous two years. 
  Second, as the reform and opening up in China deepened, 
foreign investment has significantly increased since 1992. Such 
input has not only expanded the aggregate demand but also 
generated purchasing power in foreign exchange. As a result, we 
have been able to utilize the supply from the international 
community and consequently expand the "total supply" which can 
be utilized. 
  Third, what is of particular importance is that because our 
market economic mechanism has begun to play its role in an 
ever-expanding area and the proportion of the non state-owned 
economy has been expanding, the efficiency of resource 
disposition has been raised as has the investment efficiency. 
The reality of the growth has also been greatly increased as 
the structural reform itself can upgrade the real growth rate by 
several percentage points. 
  Fourth, because local governments and many enterprises have 
begun to gain a better understanding of the importance of such 
basic industries as infrastructure, energy, and communications, 
during these years the investment in these fields has expanded 
and some of the investment has started to pay off, thus 
alleviating some local bottleneck problems and expanding the 
general supply capacity of the society. 
  All these factors indicate that making simplistic 
comparisons 
between the growth rates in different years and under different 
conditions is inappropriate. We should make realistic analyses 
of the real quality of the various growth rates and correctly 
evaluate the fast growth of the economy during the past two 
years. The author personally believes that the fast growth of 
our economy in the past two years has been basically healthy; 
though there has been a tendency toward "overheating" the 
problem has not become so severe as to call for the 
implementation of an overall austerity policy. 
  However, though the problem is not yet very severe, it has 
certainly reached the extent of meriting serious attention in 
many respects. Commodity prices on the market experienced a 
high rate of growth: Throughout the year, retail prices rose by 
13 percent over the previous year, while the cost of living of 
residents rose about 15 percent. In 35 large and medium cities, 
the cost of living index reached as much as 20 percent or so. 
On the basis of the high growth during the previous year, the 
investment in fixed assets grew by another 47 percent or so. 
The extent to which such bottleneck industries as 
communications and energy restrict the economic growth has 
become very serious, as the freight satisfaction rate is only 
about 60 percent and, on several arterial railway lines such as 
Beijing-Guangzhou, only 40 percent. All this indicates that the 
destabilizing factors in the economy have increased somewhat. 
If we fail to have a sober and scientific understanding of this 
in good time and just let it run its course without adopting 
pertinent remedial measures, this will lead to serious 
consequences. 
  Is There "Inflation of Total Demand?" 
  Since last year, the following question has been in dispute 
in Chinese economic circles: Has there been "inflation of total 
demand" in our economy and have the price increases been caused 
by excessive total demand? Many people have answered this 
question in the negative. 
  We can deny that there has been an inflation of total demand 
but we must explain the reason for the price increases, not only 
the increase of the means of production price index of 40 
percent or so but also that in the urban cost of living index of 
over 20 percent. 
  Some hold that price increases are not a result of inflation 
of total demand but of "price adjustments" or price reform. One 
must admit that the price increases in China in the past two 
years do have something to do with some measures for price 
adjustments or price reform. But why did the prices of some 
items go up, instead of going down, the moment they were 
decontrolled, in turn causing the price of other items to go up? 
The answer to this question is that before the prices were 
decontrolled, what was termed in economics as "suppressed 
inflation" existed because the original total demand had already 
expanded but had manifested itself in "shortages," as the demand 
exceeded supply at the original price levels. That is why the 
prices, once decontrolled, went up. Naturally, however, some 
element of "suppressed inflation" existing in our economy is not 
necessarily a result of the total demand expansion during the 
past two years but a problem left behind from history. However, 
at the end of the day, the increases of commodity prices after 
price controls were lifted have to be explained by the 
purchasing power (demand) which has an objective presence in the 
current economy. The price reform itself is nothing more than 
to "digest" the excessive purchasing power; in itself, it has 
not created this amount of purchasing power. 
  Another argument ascribes price increases to "cost-push." 
There is indeed a type of so-called "cost-push" inflation but 
it mainly refers to the situation whereby the costs in a 
country's economy are generally increased due to such "external 
impact" (exogenous variable) as an "oil crisis." However, it 
does not make much sense to ascribe China's post-1992 situation 
to "cost-push." Since the second half of 1992, because the 
demand on investment quickly expanded, the price levels of the 
means of production increased by 40 percent or more. Such cost 
increases will certainly have to be "digested" by other 
commodity prices through cost increases [as published] in a 
gradual process (over a period of time). It is obviously a 
confusion of concepts and a circular argument to term this price 
change as "cost-push" rather than ascribing it to the expansion 
of the original investment demand. In present-day China, a kind 
of "cost-push" inflation does often happen, i.e., the payroll 
costs of state-owned enterprises (including all kinds of 
consumption at public expense, distribution of benefits in kind, 
and welfare benefits) constantly rising at a higher rate than 
the growth in labor productivity, causing a chain reaction in 
price levels. This factor can be considered a constant factor 
in our system at the moment, which does not change whether the 
economy is "hot" or "cold." For example, one could say that 
1990 was a relatively "cold" year for our economy, as there was 
no serious inflation. But it was that year that the actual 
per-capita wages of state-owned units increased by 9.7 percent 
(bringing the actual total payroll up by 9.2 percent), 
representing the highest growth rate since the 1970's. However, 
this did not cause high-rate inflation that year. Since this is 
a "constant factor," it cannot cause high-rate inflation of 
itself. Therefore, we cannot use this factor to explain what 
has happened over the past two years. 
  Still another argument is to ascribe price increases to an 
"imbalance of structure." True, in economic studies there is a 
type of inflation related to structural change but it usually 
means that when an economic structure experiences a change, 
because prices generally have a "rigidity against lowering," 
relative adjustment of price structure can only be achieved 
through the increase of some prices, thus causing an increase in 
overall price levels. The cause and effect of this situation is 
different from, and therefore cannot be compared with, the cause 
and effect of another situation, i.e., price increase caused by 
the inflation of total demand and the failure of total supply to 
expand quickly due to serious structural "bottleneck" 
restrictions. Economic structural adjustments have been 
continuous in our country in past years (i.e., the first case), 
including the past two years and the earlier period of 
improvement and rectification (structural adjustments and price 
adjustments never being infrequent during the period of 
improvement and rectification) but they did not cause high price 
increases. Therefore, we cannot use this to explain what has 
happened over the past two years. The structural problem in our 
economy over the past two years is mainly that the expansion of 
total demand has aggravated the restriction of the structural 
"bottlenecks" (i.e., the second case), such as the 
communications bottleneck and the energy bottleneck, in turn 
aggravating the price increase pressures. Therefore, the main 
cause should be ascribed to the imbalance of total supply and 
demand, not to structural adjustments. 
  There is no denying that there are always an infinite number 
of factors in economic life which determine the movement of 
prices (each factor determining the price change at a certain 
percentage point). However, by carefully analyzing the 
situation with economic theory, we will have to come to the 
conclusion that the increases of price levels in our country 
over the past two years were mainly caused by the inflation of 
total demand. According to the "objects," the total demand can 
be divided into two parts, investment demand and consumption 
demand. The expansion of total demand in our country over the 
past two years finds expression mainly in the expansion of 
investment demand and the demand of "consumption at public 
expense" and the basic mechanism of such expansion is not very 
different from the previous one. The mechanism of China's 
macroeconomic operation has not gone through a "fundamental 
change." Lack of a sober understanding of these basic judgments 
will make it very hard to uphold a correct and realistic 
guideline in economic work. 
  Why Is Inflation "Not Good?" 
  One cannot deny there is some point in the 
"inflation-is-harmless theory." First, in terms of the 
relationship between total supply and total demand only, any 
change in the general price level merely means a change in the 
"nominal value" of the GNP and does not affect the growth of its 
"real value," the increase of actual income being most 
important. Second, though the prices may go up a bit, as long 
as the economy maintains an active growth momentum it is better 
than the situation whereby commodity prices stay where they are 
but economic growth comes to a halt. Third, many structural 
problems and problems with price parity can only be gradually 
adjusted and solved in the course of the increase of the general 
price level and so on and so forth. 
  Nevertheless, to this day, there is no country in the world 
that does not try its best to avoid inflation. Why is that? 
The reason is that inflation does have some negative effects 
that must not be overlooked. There may be nothing wrong with 
inflation itself but some things which happen during and after 
inflation are not so good. 
  First, the process of inflation normally involves 
redistribution of the national income and widening the gaps in 
income, which includes not only the gap between urban and rural 
incomes but also that between the incomes of different regions 
and walks of life. This is more so during the current period of 
economic transformation when the market mechanism in our country 
is still underdeveloped and its economic structure is 
irrational. For instance, a relatively developed region had an 
economic growth rate of 14 percent in 1993, its cost of living 
index was 20 percent, and the monetary income of the residents 
there grew by around 44 percent. To this region, that bit of 
inflation was of course tolerable and no big deal. But where 
did the "extra" income of around 10 percent come from? 
Obviously, it could only have come from other regions, more 
likely from the more backward regions and rural areas. 
Therefore, this involved further expansion of regional income. 
Naturally, however, the development of the market economy means 
that we can no longer practice egalitarianism, as the existence 
of income discrepancies to some extent has a degree of 
rationality. If inflation is allowed to continue and the income 
discrepancies are too wide, this will obviously lead to 
instability in the society and will be detrimental to the 
further sustained development of the economy. What merits 
attention is that the widening of the income discrepancies is 
related to macroeconomic conditions. 
  Second, inflation and the overall imbalance whereby total 
demand exceeds total supply would ordinarily cause acceleration 
of economic growth. Under the existing system of our country, 
it will cause "overheated growth" in the economy. What is 
called "overheated growth" is relative to the growth rate of the 
total supply capacity of the society or the actual growth 
capacity of economy. It is not measured by the absolute value 
of growth rate but manifests itself through such phenomena as 
"bottlenecks," "excessive utilization of equipment," "lowering 
of the actual capital accumulation rate," and "eating corn on 
the stalk." In the history of our country, these phenomena have 
happened from time to time and they are all forms of "overheated 
growth." They point to a poor dynamic efficiency of economic 
growth and are detrimental to the long-term, sustained, steady, 
and fast growth of the economy. 
  Third, inflation, unstable currency value, and failure to 
maintain long-term overheated growth all cause stronger 
uncertainties in the economy. This will hamper the growth of 
savings deposits and the expansion of actual investment, 
especially the input of foreign capital, and weaken the 
favorable conditions we have for absorbing foreign capital. 
They are also unfavorable for the continued fast growth of the 
economy. 
  One has to admit that during the period of economic 
transformation, in the process of structural reform and in the 
initial stage of economic development, inflation is often 
unavoidable and some fluctuations in the macroeconomy are also 
unavoidable. Without them, economic transformation and economic 
growth would probably have been impossible. People at all 
levels must have a sober understanding of this. In the past 
dozen years of reform and development in our country, the 
average growth rate was about 10 percent and inflation rate was 
always kept under a controllable level, without causing the 
galloping inflation which has plagued many developing countries 
and countries going through structural reforms or caused big 
social turmoil because of inflation. This in itself is a very 
big achievement and should not be underestimated. However, 
because inflation has not caused big problems in the past does 
not mean that "inflation is harmless" or that we do not have to 
take preventive measures. 
<H5>  "Double-Track Regulation and Control" </H5>
  After we have obtained a relatively clear understanding of 
the reality of our economic situation, the problem now is how to 
conduct macroregulation and control to achieve our goals. 
  1. Evaluation of the current economic system. 
  The first issue to understand is that the choice of 
effective 
means of macroregulation and control depends on understanding 
the microeconomic system and the macrooperational mechanism. 
The existing system is the basic premise for the effectiveness 
of current macroregulation and control policies. 
  After 15 years of reform and opening up, our country's 
economic system has undergone many important changes. First, 
the nonstate-owned economy, as a "new sector of system," has had 
much development and its proportion in the total industrial 
output value and GNP has exceeded 50 percent. As economic 
subjects which are oriented to the market and have relatively 
strong self-restraint, they play a positive role in stabilizing 
the economy. Second, the price reform, after the "double-track 
transition" in the past years, has scored a decisive success. 
The prices of over 90 percent of consumer goods and the prices 
of over 80 percent of the means of production have been 
decontrolled and put under market regulation. Third, marked 
successes have been achieved in opening to the outside world. 
Foreign investment has greatly increased, imports and exports 
have further expanded, and price increases have been restricted 
by the prices on the international market in many respects (such 
as rolled steel and other means of production). Fourth, all 
kinds of markets have gone through some development. Though some 
confusion has happened on the stock market, real estate market, 
and securities market (especially activities of "speculation at 
public expense" by state-owned and semi state-owned companies 
that have emerged in these markets), residents have been given 
more investment channels after all. This is conducive to 
checking the expansion of consumption demand and encouraging the 
accumulation of capital. As a result of all this, the system of 
market economy in our country has begun to play a part, to some 
extent and within a certain scope, and an embryonic form of 
market mechanism has come into being in China. 
  However, it is still too early to think that China's 
economic 
system has gone through a "fundamental change" simply on the 
basis of the abovementioned situation or in reference to the 
spell of "market sluggishness" during the austerity period 
during the previous two years. Our economy is still in the 
stage of "double-track transition," an important manifestation 
of which is that the old economic system is still functioning. 
This can be recognized from the following two most important 
aspects. 
  First, there has been no change in the structure of the 
basic 
system of the state-owned economic sector and soft budgetary 
restraints by local governments and state-run enterprises, as 
well as various behavioral patterns based on them (including the 
ways to react to many economic "policy variables"), have 
remained basically unchanged. For instance, the "way to react" 
to the adjustment of "interest rates" by state-owned enterprises 
and local governments as an important macroregulation policy 
instrument has not changed. Though everybody is complaining that 
the "interest rate costs" are too high, even if interest rates 
are raised even higher, the demand by the state-owned sector for 
loans will not decrease. 
  Second, the dominating position of the state-owned economy 
(note that we are not talking about the "public-owned economy" 
here) in the entire economy has remained unchanged. This can be 
illustrated from the following aspects. A) While in terms of 
output value or the creation of national income the state-owned 
economy has ceased to take up the bigger portion, in terms of 
expenditure or the creation of total demand the state-owned 
economy still occupies a dominant position. The key issue here 
is that when bank deposits from different economic sectors are 
transformed into loans, they flow mainly to state-owned economic 
departments through the state banking system (generally 
estimated at over 80 percent at present). The loans used by 
township and town enterprises and the private or 
individually-owned economy only take up a very small proportion. 
This way, the state-run sector, which accounts for the smaller 
proportion in the revenue structure continues to enjoy the 
bigger proportion of the expenditure structure, especially 
expenditure on investment. In terms of direct financing by 
enterprises, because budgetary restraints are soft, state-owned 
enterprises are relatively "bold" and, naturally, are able to 
attract more funds. B) The state-owned economy is concentrated 
in such lifelines of the national economy as light and heavy 
industries, energy, and minerals and, therefore, its role of 
leadership in the national economy has not changed either. C) 
With the abovementioned two points as a basis, what is 
determining the changes in various stages of economic 
fluctuations in China at present is still the state-owned 
economic sector. Township and town enterprises, the private 
economy, and so on showed relatively high growth rates as early 
as 1990. However, because they were mainly concentrated in 
consumer goods processing industries, commerce, and the service 
industries, they merely played the role of maintaining the 
supply of consumer goods and were still unable to cause the 
entire economy to pick up. Only when the state-owned economy 
"recovered" did the entire economy gradually become active. 
Particularly outstanding is that, aside from the fact that the 
investment by the state-owned sector still takes the bigger 
portion of the overall investment society-wide (over 67 percent 
in 1993), the expansion of investment in the state-owned 
economy, as in all previous cases of economic fluctuations, 
plays a leading and decisive role in the overall pickup of the 
economy. D) In financial revenue, the income from the profits 
and taxes delivered by state-run enterprises still takes up the 
bigger portion. Because the state of fiscal revenue and 
expenditure plays a very important role in the formulation of 
macroeconomic policies, the performance of the state-run 
economic sector continues to play a decisive role in shaping the 
trends of the entire macroeconomy. For instance, just in order 
to keep the amount of profits and taxes delivered by state-run 
enterprises from dropping or to avoid further expansion of the 
extent of losses, the relevant departments probably do not dare, 
or are not willing, to adopt policies which curtail credit 
expansion and inflation of demand (e.g. raising the interest 
rates for loans). 
  2. "Double-track system" and "double-track regulation 
and control." 
  The basic meaning of what is called "double-track regulation 
and control" is that: According to the "double-track" feature 
of our economy, is to exercise integrated regulation and control 
on the economy by actively using some macropolicies and means of 
market economy which have begun to show effect while, on the 
other hand, continuing to use the means of "direct control" 
which are suited to the old system, including some 
administrative means. 
  In the process of choosing the right stabilizing policies 
for the macroeconomy at present, the following issues concerning 
understanding should be made clear before anything else: 
  First, what one should particularly seek to have a clear 
understanding about at the moment are: A) The effectiveness of 
different macroeconomic regulation and control policies depends 
on different economic systems, especially the "micro basis" of 
economy. B) We need to develop the market economy but our 
existing economic system is not yet a market economy and the 
"micro basis" of the macroeconomic operation is far from being 
the "micro basis" of a market economy. This is the very reason 
that many stabilizing policies for macroeconomy which are 
effective in the context of a market economy are, in reality, 
unable to play their role effectively in the context of our 
existing system. This finds conspicuous expression in the 
following: The state-owned economic sector, which still resorts 
to administrative links in operation to a large extent, can only 
be restrained by administrative means for the time being; while 
localities and enterprise lack a built-in self-restraining 
mechanism, it is still imperative to retain certain external 
restraints. We must now energetically develop the system of 
market economy. This mainly requires us to put our efforts into 
the structural reform, especially in transforming the micro 
basis of the economy. It does not mean that we can change the 
"policies" or "means" for managing the economy entirely. Any 
blind attempt to try using the policies of market economy which 
have proved effective in managing our economy now will not 
really be conducive to the development of a market economy and 
will not really be a move toward "marketization." 
  Second, the structural reform is a process which takes quite 
some time before any effects can be seen but macroregulation and 
control is an issue concerning the short-term "management of 
total demand." These two must not be confused. Therefore, the 
formula of "seeking current macrostability by way of deepening 
the reform" is a specious concept. The reform should move ahead 
at a faster pace and this is even more necessary at present. 
However, before the reform is accomplished, we still have to 
face the issue of how to exercise macroregulation and control in 
the context of the existing system. Only the formula of "seeking 
long-term economic stability by way of deepening the reform" is 
correct. Third, though our economy is not yet a complete 
market economy, it is no longer a complete planned economy 
either. It is in the period of transition from the old system 
to the new and its basic feature is "one system on double 
tracks." This feature of an economic system obviously requires 
the means of macroregulation and control also to be on "double 
tracks." Using only one method, in defiance of the law of 
movement of things, will actually fail to bring about the 
desired results. This finds conspicuous expression in the 
following: We do not now have a means of macroregulation and 
control that can effectively regulate and control the economy, 
be it direct or indirect, "market" or "administrative," 
"monetary" or "planned"; on the other hand, none of the various 
means of regulation and control is entirely useless, for they 
all have a certain role to play to some extent within a certain 
scope. This requires us to use various means in an "integrated" 
way and exercise "integrated regulation and control" on the 
economy. During the "double-track transition" period, 
"integrated regulation and control" is, by nature, a 
manifestation of "double-track regulation and control." 
  3. The reform of the macromanagement system must step 
beyond the vision of state-owned economy. 
  As to how to shift from the "double-track regulation and 
control" to "one track" ("market track"), it obviously will have 
to depend on the deepening of the reform. (At present, the 
reform of the relations between ownership and management of 
enterprises is of especial importance.) As regards some reform 
measures which have been adopted or are going to be adopted, I 
think an important problem here is that many reform proposals 
are still confined to the area of the state-owned economy and 
have not stepped beyond the vision of the state-owned economy. 
The reform of the financial system is still largely about the 
division or merger of state-owned banks and the development of 
nonstate-owned financial institutions has not been put on the 
agenda. The reform of the tax system is still largely about the 
division between the central government and local governments 
and the question of how to straighten out the control on the tax 
management of the nonstate-owned economy, reconstruct local 
financial systems, and sort out basic financial relations, 
according to the changed economic structures, and rebuild the 
entire financial system on the basis of this is still being 
neglected. The reform of the investment system is still largely 
concerned with how to handle the investment in the state-owned 
economy and how to provide protection for such investment. The 
enterprise reform is still revolving round the state-owned 
enterprises, as if the enterprises in the nonstate-owned economy 
have nothing to do with promoting faster and more healthy 
development by way of strengthening the building of their 
system. Even the reform of the statistical system has not done 
anything new about how to conduct statistical studies on the 
activities of the nonstate-owned economy which already makes up 
over 50 percent of the total output value. The nonstate-owned 
economy has been developing for many years as a "new force 
suddenly coming to the fore" in an "expected" way, helping our 
economy break through the confines of the state-owned economy in 
an "unconscious" way. Should this "unconscious" state continue?

  [Text] Beijing, 10 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--As it is 
difficult for government department-run economic entities to 
make money, cadres who went into business last year "are 
returning to their original posts." 
  According to the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce, 1993 saw the greatest number of government 
department-run economic entities; all the licenses kept in stock 
had been given away by July. In Shanxi alone, provincial-level 
government departments set up 1,098 companies on a trial basis 
last year, and a total of 3,000 cadres went into business. Of 
this total, however, 50 percent have returned to their original 
posts. Seven department- and bureau-level cadres went into 
business last year, but all have gone back to their old 
profession. Of the 120 county- and section-level cadres who 
went into business last year, half have returned to government 
departments. Of the 667 subsection-level cadres who went into 
business last year, 427 have returned to their original posts. 
  A survey shows the main reason why cadres have been jumping 
off the bandwagon like a swarm of bees is that it is difficult 
to make money. Most government department-run economic entities 
have failed to turn a profit. In Anhui, various companies run 
by government departments suffered 7 million yuan in economic 
losses in one year. These economic entities will face even 
greater difficulties after their ties with government cadres 
have been completely severed.

  [Text] Beijing, May 18 (CNS) -- Two vast enterprise groups 
under the Ministry of Internal Trade were set up today to cover 
most of the daily necessities and grains as well as oil products. 
  The Zhong Shang Enterprise Group comprises 43 member 
companies with the China National Hardware Communication and 
Electrical Appliances Company, a general merchandise company, 
wine and sugar companies, food companies, and the Friendship 
Company as its core. The total registered capital is valued at 
RMB [renminbi] 1.7 billion. 
  The Zhong Gu Cereals and Oil Group is the largest enterprise 
in the sector of grain and food industry including member 
companies such as the China National Cereals Trade Company, the 
China Vegetable Oil Company, and the China National Fodder 
Holding Company. 
  The Minister of Internal Trade Mr. Zhang Haoruo, said at the 
opening ceremony that establishment of the two comprehensive 
enterprise groups was considered the very measure for reform of 
circulation enterprises. They made medium- and large-sized 
state-owned enterprises as their core and state-owned assets as 
their main driving force. The two enterprise groups cover a 
large number of items of a wide variety which involve different 
regions, departments, and various economic components. 
  The two enterprise groups shoulder the role in helping the 
government to carry out effective macroregulation of the market. 
The Chinese leadership highly valued the establishment of the 
two enterprise groups and Premier Li Peng and vice premiers Mr. 
Zou Jiahua and Mr. Li Lanqing made congratulatory inscriptions 
for the two groups. 
  Sources in the sectors concerned, as well as experts, paid 
much attention to the setting up of the enterprise groups. They 
were convinced that the large enterprise groups possessed huge 
strength which enabled them to exert their advantages and to 
play an important role in showing competitiveness in the 
international market for circulation enterprises.

<F P=106> [Report: "Provisional Procedures for Management of </F>
Automatic Registration of Import of Specific Commodities, 
Promulgated by Five Departments, Including the State Planning 
Commission"] 
  [Text] The State Planning Commission, the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the People's Bank of 
China, the General Administration of Customs, and the State 
Administration of Exchange Control, in cooperation with other 
departments concerned, have formulated the "Provisional 
Procedures for Management of Automatic Registration of Import of 
Specific Commodities," in accordance with the instructions of 
leading comrades of the State Council, with a view to ensuring 
the smooth progress of the reform of the foreign exchange 
control system, intensifying the state's overall monitoring of 
importation of important commodities, keeping informed of the 
current state of import of a few categories of staple raw and 
processed materials and sensitive commodities, and providing 
guidelines to enterprises. The following is the full text of 
the provisional procedures: 
  Article 1. These procedures are hereby formulated with a 
view to intensifying the state's macroscopic monitoring of 
importation of important commodities, keeping informed of the 
current state of import of a few categories of staple raw and 
processed materials and sensitive commodities, and providing 
guidelines to enterprises. 
  Article 2. The State Planning Commission is in charge of 
guiding, coordinating, and managing automatic registration of 
importation of specific commodities nationwide. 
  The competent divisions and bureaus under the departments 
concerned of the State Council, as well as the planning 
commissions (or planning and economic commissions) of all 
provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the 
central government, and cities separately listed in the state 
plan (hereinafter called "registration organs" for short), which 
are authorized by the State Planning Commission, are in charge 
of the automatic registration of imports of specific commodities 
within their own departments or localities. 
  If any enterprises subordinate to other departments of the 
State Council lacking the authorization of the State Planning 
Commission want to have their importation of commodities 
registered, they will do so with the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation. 
  Article 3. A list of specific commodities subject to 
automatic import registration is to be prepared by the 
department concerned of the State Planning Commission in 
accordance with the state's need for macroeconomic regulation 
and control, and this list will be submitted to the State 
Council for examination and announced upon approval. 
  The following commodities are on the provisional import 
registration list for 1994: 1) steel products, 2) steel billets, 
3) scrap steel, 4) discarded ships, 5) non-ferrous metal 
(copper, aluminum), 6) plastic material (polyethylene, 
polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene except ABS 
resin), 7) paper, 8) fruits, and 9) cosmetics. 
  Article 4. Imports in the following forms of trade are 
subject to import registration in accordance with these 
procedures: 1) General imports as a form of trade, 2) imports 
financed by loans granted by foreign governments or financial 
institutions, 3) consignment sale imports, 4) leased imports [zu 
lin jin kou 4436 6324 6651 0656], 5) compensation trade imports, 
6) imports by international tender, 7) imports in exchange for 
labor services, and 8) donated imports. 
  Commodities subject to automatic import registration, which 
are imported for the business of processing with supplied or 
imported materials and will be directly used in processing 
production and reexported as processed goods, shall be placed 
under customs control and supervision. 
  Another set of procedures shall be formulated separately to 
regulate the automatic import registration for commodities 
imported by foreign-funded enterprises as capital goods, goods 
for their own consumption, or materials to be used to produce 
products for domestic markets. 
  Article 5. Import registration is necessary in the following 
cases: 
  1. The imported commodities are those which the departments 
or localities concerned need in production and construction or 
those for which there is a market demand. 
  2. The imports are to be paid for with renminbi funds. 
  3. The importing foreign trade company has confirmation from 
both the goods supplier and the Chinese buyer, and therefore 
needs a signed import certificate. 
  Article 6. Before instructing a foreign trade enterprise 
with authorization for importation of the specific commodity to 
sign the import contract (only foreign trade enterprises 
endorsed by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation should be instructed to import steel products), the 
enterprise that is to proceed to import will lodge its 
registration application with the appropriate registration organ 
through appropriate administrative channels (enterprises 
importing fruits and cosmetics will file the registration 
application with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation). The registration organ concerned, upon receipt of 
the enterprise's application, will proceed with registration 
formalities, providing that the application fulfills the 
requirements set out in these procedures, or explain if 
rejecting the application. 
  Article 7. A "Certificate for Registration of Importation 
of Specific Commodities" on a unified form printed by the State 
Planning Commission is necessary for importation of specific 
commodities subject to automatic import registration. 
  The "Certificate for Registration of Importation of Specific 
Commodities" is in quadruplicate. The original copy (in black) 
will be given to a bank authorized to deal in foreign exchange 
upon request for conversion of local currency into foreign 
currency; the second copy (in red) goes to the customs office 
for examination; the third copy (in blue) goes to the foreign 
trade company authorized to deal in importation of the specific 
commodity as a proof of order; and the fourth copy (in purple) 
will be filed by the registration certificate issuing organ. 
  Article 8. The valid seal for the "Certificate of 
Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" is the 
"Exclusive Seal for Registration of Import of Specific 
Commodities" made and granted by the State Planning Commission. 
  Article 9. An authorized bank for dealing in foreign 
exchange will render foreign exchange payment service to a 
customer upon presentation of a "Certificate of Registration of 
Import of Specific Commodities," while the customs office will 
inspect and clear imported goods upon presentation of the 
"Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" 
issued by the import registration organ authorized by the State 
Planning Commission. 
  For imports affected by such trading modes as loans granted 
by Chinese or foreign creditors, donations, aid, compensation 
trade, leasing trade, and counter trade, which do not entitle 
the importer to buy foreign exchange, the original copy of the 
"Certificate of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" 
(which is to be presented by the importer to a bank authorized 
to deal in foreign exchange upon request for foreign exchange 
payment service) will not be issued to the importer but be kept 
on file by the import registration organ. 
  Article 10. The validity period of the "Certificate of 
Registration of Import of Specific Commodities" is six months. 
If an import contract needs to be extended beyond this validity 
period, reregistration will be necessary with the original 
certificate issuing organ, and the import registration 
certificate previously issued will be returned to the issuer. 
If any particulars (other than the validity period) stated in 
the import registration certificate need to be amended within 
the validity period, the importer will apply to the original 
import registration certificate issuer for amendment, which is 
to be stated in the "Remarks" column of the certificate and 
endorsed by the "Exclusive Seal for Registration of Import of 
Specific Commodities." 
  Article 11. All the import registration organs shall 
properly perform their duties regarding import registration 
within their own jurisdiction, keep track of the ordering and 
delivery of goods that are imported according to the import 
registration, prepare a full list of import items registered in 
the previous month and submit it to the State Planning 
Commission by the 10th day of each month to facilitate overall 
monitoring and control of import of registered commodities. 
  Article 12. In any of the following cases related to the 
enterprise, which are regarded as violation of these procedures, 
no bank shall render the enterprise foreign exchange payment 
service, no customs office will grant approval to the import, 
and appropriate penalties will be meted out in accordance with 
relevant regulations. 
  1. Failure to secure a "Certificate of Registration of 
Import 
of Specific Commodities" according to these procedures, prior to 
the signing of an import contract with a foreign party and 
shipment of the imported goods which are subject to import 
registration. 
  2. Forging, altering, or illegally reselling a "Certificate 
of Registration of Import of Specific Commodities." 
  Article 13. Any staff member of an import registration organ 
who is involved in dereliction of duty, irregularities for the 
benefit of relatives or friends, or abuse of power, will be 
liable to administrative action by the supervisory organ 
according to the seriousness of the specific case. In case of 
violation of laws, the offender will be held responsible for 
criminal offense.

date of promulgation. 
  Article 15. The right of the interpretation of these 
procedures resides in the State Planning Commission.

Issuing `Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities 
Through Border Trade'--State Commercial Inspection Bureau's 
Document No. 134 (1993)"] 
  [Text] All affiliated commercial inspection bureaus: 
  After a year of trial implementation, the "Inspection and 
Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities Through 
Border Trade (for Trial Implementation)" have proved basically 
feasible. Some clauses have been revised in light of the present 
situation. Now the "Management Methods for Import and Export 
Commodities Through Border Trade" are issued to you for 
implementation. Should there be problems in the course of 
implementation, please report them to the state bureau. 
  Attached are the Management Methods for Import and Export 
Commodities Through Border Trade. 
  The State Commercial Inspection Bureau of the PRC 
  22 April 1993 
  Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities Through 
Border Trade: 
  Article 1: To develop border trade, strengthen the 
inspection, assessment, and supervision of import and export 
commodities, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of 
all the trading parties, these management methods have been 
formulated in accordance with the "PRC Inspection Methods for 
Import and Export Commodities" (hereinafter shortened to the 
"Inspection Methods") and the "Regulations on Implementing the 
PRC Inspection Methods for Import and Export Commodities" 
(hereinafter shortened to the "Implementation Regulations"). 
  Article 2: These management methods are suitable for 
inspection and management of import and export commodities 
through small-scale border trade, civilian border trade, joint 
fair trade on borders, and local trade in border areas. 
  Article 3: Commercial inspection departments' inspection of 
import and export commodities through border trade covers the 
following categories of commodities: 
  1. Import and export commodities which fall under the "list 
of categories of import and export commodities subject to 
commercial inspection departments' inspection" as well as import 
and export commodities which, as law and administrative 
regulations require, must be submitted to commercial inspection 
departments for inspection; 
  2. Carrying out health inspection of export food and 
quarantine of export animal products; 
  3. Commodities for which border trade contracts require 
inspection by commercial inspection departments; 
  4. Commodities for which foreign trade dealers apply for 
assessment and inspection. 
  Article 4: Commercial inspection departments may carry out 
random checks on import and export commodities which are not 
listed in Clauses 1 to 3 of Article 3. 
  Article 5: When handling applications for inspection of 
import and export commodities through border trade, commercial 
inspection departments may treat each case on its merits in 
light of local border trade characteristics by adopting flexible 
inspection methods, providing certificates to pass, or 
completing clearance procedures. 
  Applications for inspection must be accompanied by the 
relevant contracts or agreements as proof. 
  Article 6: Import and export commodities through local trade 
in border areas, small-scale border trade, or civilian border 
trade must be inspected according to the contract provisions if 
any; if contract provisions are not available or are not clear, 
inspection should proceed in accordance with the standards of 
the relevant exporting country. If commodities involve safety 
and health, inspection should proceed according to the 
regulations of the relevant importing country. Import 
commodities below the necessary safety and health standards 
should be prohibited from entry even if the buyer agrees to 
accept the commodities. 
  Article 7: Commodities imported with safety quality permits 
should be handled according to the "Detailed Rules on Importing 
Commodities Under the Safety Quality License System." 
  Article 8: After a port commercial inspection department 
receives notice of import commodities' arrival, it should 
proceed with the inspection of the commodities if inspection at 
the port is possible. 
  If inspection at the port is not available, the port 
commercial inspection department should promptly provide a 
transfer procedural document and notify the port of arrival for 
inspection of the commodities. 
  Article 9: If a foreign trade dealer applies for the 
assessment or authorizes the inspection of commodities, the 
commodities should be assessed or inspected in accordance with 
the standards set by the foreign trade dealer. 
  Article 10: Commercial inspection departments should, in 
accordance with the relevant regulations, exercise management 
over commodities exported with quality licenses and health 
registration certificates. Border trade operational units 
should purchase commodities manufactured by factories which have 
obtained quality licenses or health registration certificates 
issued by commercial inspection departments, and should submit 
these licenses or certificates to the commercial inspection 
departments in the commodities' places of origin. 
  Article 11: Commercial inspection departments may send 
personnel to inspect, check, assess, and supervise import and 
export commodities stored in regions under their jurisdiction or 
to trading sites under their jurisdiction. 
  Article 12: Before export commodities which require 
commercial inspection certificates are directly transported out 
of the borders through combined railway transportation, the 
commercial inspection departments in places where the 
commodities are dispatched should verify that the commodities 
are up to standard before issuing such commercial inspection 
certificates. 
  For export commodities transported through combined 
transportation facilities other than railways, commercial 
inspection exchange certificates or release certificates should 
be issued by the commercial inspection departments in the places 
of dispatch; and the relevant port commercial inspection 
departments should examine the exchange certificates and 
complete the clearance procedures for the export commodities to 
be transported out of the borders. Commodities which are proved 
to be below standard cannot be exported. 
  Article 13: After inspection, the relevant commercial 
inspection departments should stamp the words "border trade" on 
the certificates issued for export commodities through border 
trade. The "border trade" stamp will be standardized by the 
State Commercial Inspection Bureau. 
  Article 14: Violations of these methods are liable to 
penalties in accordance with the "Inspection Methods" and the 
"Implementation Regulations." Units or individuals 
manufacturing or selling counterfeit commodities will be 
severely dealt with in accordance with Articles 52 and 53 of the 
"Implementation Regulations." 
  Article 15: Commercial inspection departments will collect 
charges in accordance with the relevant regulations for the work 
they have done in inspecting and assessing import and export 
commodities. 
  Article 16: In light of border trade characteristics and 
local conditions, commercial inspection departments in border 
areas may designate the scope of import and export commodities 
for inspection and formulate methods for exercising inspection 
and management. 
  Article 17: The State Commercial Inspection Bureau is 
responsible for explaining these methods. These methods will 
come into effect on 1 June 1993. The former "Inspection and 
Management Methods for Import and Export Commodities Through 
Border Trade (for trial implementation)" promulgated on 1 June 
1992 are simultaneously revoked.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Jianguo (2621 1696 0948): "Heading for the </F>
Arena of International Competition--Roundup of Results Scored by 
Chinese Enterprises in Transnational Operations"] 
  [Text] When the transnational groups and corporations of 
the developed nations were active on the world economic stage 15 
years ago, China was practicing a closed-door policy, and the 
term "transnational corporation" was usually derogatory. Since 
the mid 1980's, a number of large and medium-sized Chinese 
enterprises with solid foundations, in conformity with the trend 
of the world's economic internationalization and 
regionalization, have stepped out of the country, have taken an 
active part in international competition, have established 
transnational companies with Chinese characteristics, and have 
scored gratifying achievements. The Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation and other units recently held the first 
exhibition on China's transnational operation in Beijing, 
displaying the course of development of China's transnational 
operations. 
<H5>  Great Achievements Attained in Transnational Operation </H5>
  Since reform and opening up, the Chinese Government has 
vigorously encouraged and supported those large and medium-size 
enterprises which have the requisite conditions to seize the 
opportunity, take part in international competition, and engage 
in transnational operations. There are now more than 7,000 
various types of foreign economic and trade enterprises. Their 
import and export volume has increased 750 percent over the past 
15 years to reach $195.8 billion. The volume of their imports 
and exports has leaped to 11th place internationally. Their 
investment abroad totals $5.16 billion, where they now own 4,500 
enterprises. The volume of foreign contracts undertaken and 
labor services offered totals $32.4 billion, with a turnover of 
$20 billion. Over the years, they have sent more than 800,000 
contract laborers to 169 countries and regions. 
  The transnational operations of Chinese enterprises 
developed 
from simply setting up trade offices abroad and running 
processing enterprises to commodity trade, contracting foreign 
projects and offering labor services, international tourism, 
exploitation of resources, production and processing, 
transportation, catering, consultation, finance, and insurance, 
which formed a multi-level and all-directional opening up 
structure at various levels and channels. Of this, the China 
Petrochemical Corporation, China Foreign Shipping, China 
Hardware and Minerals Corporation, China Petroleum Engineering 
and Construction Company, China Construction Corporation, 
Guangdong Investment Group, and the international economic 
cooperation companies in Liaoning, Shanghai, Fujian, and Beijing 
are the most outstanding transnational companies. The China 
Petrochemical Corporation has become a comprehensive 
transnational group operating in crude oil, chemical fertilizer, 
chemicals, and rubber and plastic goods. The corporation's 
business volume in 1993 totaled $13.211 billion, ranking first 
in the country's foreign trade sector. The corporation was also 
selected by the United State's FORTUNE magazine as one of the 
top 30 of the world's 500 largest comprehensive service 
enterprises for four years in a row. The China Port Engineering 
Company and four other companies also joined the ranks of the 
255 largest international engineering companies. 
  By focusing on their own trade, China's transnational 
enterprises developed diversified businesses. Most of them have 
transformed from a single business to a diversified operation 
and from a special company to a comprehensive company. 
Internationalization, industrialization, and the formation of 
groups has become a trend. 
  For example, the groups represented by the China Resources 
and China International Trust and Investment Corporation engage 
primarily in trade and investment. They are also involved in 
production, technology, services, finance, consultation, 
information, and other business areas. A number of engineering, 
construction, and international economic and technological 
cooperation companies, represented by China Construction, China 
Port, and China Fujian shoulder the mission of China's aid to 
foreign countries. Focused on contracting foreign projects and 
offering labor services, they are also engaged in other 
businesses. 
<H5>  Make the Most of Advantages and Develop New Markets </H5>
  Although the transnational operation of China's enterprises 
is no match for the transnational groups of the developed 
nations in terms of capital and scale of business, they do have 
their unique advantages. 
  The first advantage: The state encourages and supports most 
of the transnational enterprises. The state bears 
responsibility for these companies and offers certain 
preferential policies. As these enterprises have strong backing 
in materials and capital, they enjoy high prestige. For 
example, in developing a real estate project, the Huarong 
(Macao) Engineering Company, which has done an outstanding job 
in recent years, smoothly proceeded with the construction of 
Huarong Square, which involved an investment of millions of Hong 
Kong dollars, and attained marked economic results because it 
got enormous financial support from the Fujian Finance 
Department and the Huaxing and Huafu companies. 
  The second advantage: China has gradually established a 
comprehensive industrial foundation and has advantages in 
applicable technology and traditional techniques. Some 
enterprises have superior operation and management experience in 
technology and products. At the same time, they have trained a 
number of qualified personnel for transnational operations. 
  The third advantage: The comprehensive competitiveness of 
enterprises is enhanced in the course of the merger. In face of 
the competitive international market and a small number of 
transnational conglomerates, China's transnational enterprises 
have adopted the method of gradually forming combinations at 
home and mergers abroad, vigorously developing export-oriented 
enterprise groups at home, and making full use of their 
economies of scale to attain superiority in cost of operation 
and production, technology, and management. A small number of 
large enterprises with solid financial foundations have started 
transnational mergers abroad, making full use of the available 
technology, management, and supply and sales network of the 
local enterprises to expand their operations. 
  In coordination with the Academy of Sciences, Qinghua 
University, and the Nonferrous Metal Research Institute, the 
China Hardware and Minerals Import and Export Corporation 
invested in a series of high-tech products. They also merged a 
number of relevant enterprises at home and abroad, gradually 
developed a coordinated process of raw materials extraction, 
processing, and export, and made marked progress in running 
enterprises abroad. 
  The Shoudu Iron and Steel Complex, which has made a major 
breakthrough in transnational operations since the early 1990's, 
has 12 enterprises abroad, involving a total investment of $180 
million. The complex invested $120 million in purchasing Peru 
Iron Ore in 1992, which has become one of China's largest 
enterprises abroad. 
<H5>  Subject to Conditions and Facing Challenges </H5>
  The transnational operations of China's enterprises are 
developing vigorously, but, on the whole, they are still in the 
initial development stage. As there continues to be a wide gap 
between China's overall national strength and that of the 
developed nations, and reform and opening up must still be 
deepened further, the transnational operations of China's 
enterprises are conditioned by various factors and are facing 
challenges. 
  First, capital shortages are still a prominent problem in 
transnational operations. As China is not yet a capital 
exporting nation, capital shortages will continue to condition 
the enterprises which have investment abroad for a long time to 
come. There are two ways to settle the problem: First, 
accommodate capital abroad and, second, enterprises pooling 
funds by issuing shares. 
  Second, attention should be given to improving the 
management 
and operation level and to speed up the training of qualified 
personnel. The operation and management of some of China's 
enterprises abroad are not ideal, and their economic efficiency 
is not high enough because of the low level of operations and 
management and unqualified managerial personnel. There are also 
problems in the management system, distribution of interests, 
enterprise organizational structure, and the operational 
mechanism, which must still be further improved and settled. 
  Moreover, as the export volume of China's 
technology-intensive products accounts for a very low proportion 
of overall exports, most of the products lack competitiveness in 
the international market. Meanwhile, there are defects in the 
regional distribution and trade structure of China's enterprises 
abroad. Some enterprises have no access to information and have 
failed to make sufficient feasibility studies on running 
enterprises abroad, resulting in blind investment. 
  Looking forward to the future, with the development of 
China's economy and the enhancement of China's national 
strength, China will continuously develop, improve, and upgrade 
its transnational operations.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Foreign banking 
organizations are showing more and more interest in co-operating 
with Chinese investment funds. 
  An official of the Banking Administration Bureau under the 
People's Bank of China said that overseas co-operators now 
number 40, with a total investment amount of three billion U.S. 
dollars. 
  More than 20 Chinese investment funds have their stocks 
listed on the securities markets of New York, London and other 
European countries as well as Hong Kong. 
  Starting in 1987, the Chinese investment funds burgeoned 
particularly in 1992. 
  Banking specialists here agree that the expansion of the 
Chinese investment funds overseas indicates foreign investors' 
appreciation of the prospects for China's economic development. 
It also paves the way for China to absorb overseas capital and 
stimulates the growth of domestic investment funds.

  [Text] Beijing, May 24 (CNS)--Overseas listing of shares 
issued by China's enterprises should be based on the development 
of domestic securities market, the Deputy Director of the State 
Debts Management Department of the Ministry of Finance Mr Gao 
Jian said in the opening ceremony of a senior training class for 
the overseas listing of China's enterprise shares. 
  Such listing, according to Mr Gao, is a matter of fund 
raising as well as development of the securities market. So 
long as the securities market at home develops to a certain 
extent in which various kinds of markets operate quite sound and 
are under proper supervision while enterprises see greater 
capability for self renovation and for further development, 
enterprises are then qualified for the listing of their shares 
abroad and an expected success is therefore possible. 
  Mr Gao pointed out that China's securities market started in 
1988 with establishment of the circulation market for national 
bonds. He added that the national bond market was considered 
the centre of the entire securities market. Proper handling of 
relationship between the national bond market and the securities 
market is key to healthy development of the securities market in 
China. [as received] 
  The national bond market has in recent years proceeded at a 
fast pace with business entities undertaking transaction of 
national bonds situated at various cities across the country. A 
layout for securities trading basically took shape with the 
Shanghai Securities Exchange, the Shenzhen Securities Exchange 
and the Wuhan Securities Centre as its core and featuring a 
national automated securities quotation system as well as a 
large number of trading venues outside the exchange centres. 
The trading pattern covers spot transaction, national bond 
futures and repurchase transaction. A new system for the 
trading of national bonds which was set up last year will see 
further improvement this year while the system for issuance and 
circulation of the no-voucher national bonds tended to be much 
more sound.

  [Text] Beijing, 24 May (XINHUA) -- The State Council has 
recently approved the "State Administration of Taxation's [SAT] 
Program on Designating Its Functions, Interior Organizations, 
and Personnel Structure." In accordance with the program's 
requirements, the SAT will further adapt to the need to develop 
a socialist market economy, will accelerate the pace of taxation 
reform, and will strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control 
and supervision over the organization and collection of tax 
revenues so as to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy. 
  In accordance with the "program on designating its 
functions, 
interior organizations, and personnel structure" approved by the 
State Council, the SAT will need to strengthen the following 
principal functions: The SAT will participate in formulating 
taxation laws, regulations on tax collection, and rules for 
their implementation. The SAT will study and improve taxation 
reform programs and will organize manpower and efforts to 
implement them. It will strengthen tax revenues' important 
regulatory functions in various aspects including during the 
process of pursuing state industrial policies, facilitating 
economic restructuring, allocating resources rationally, and 
ensuring fair competition between enterprises. Furthermore, the 
SAT will intensify tax-collection efforts to ensure a steady 
rise in revenues. It will improve tax-collection 
administration, will establish and improve a system that 
systematically and scientifically levies and administers tax 
revenues based on the Law on Levying and Administering Tax 
Revenues, and will use various modern formats to increase its 
capabilities for levying and administering tax revenues. 
Additionally, it will intensify the dissemination of taxation 
laws, will increase tax-paying awareness among all the people, 
and will establish a vertical leadership structure under the SAT 
that will fulfill the requirements of the separated taxes system.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "State Grants Broader Powers to Tax </F>
Collectors"] 
  [Text] Tax collectors have been empowered to improve their 
role in the country's market-oriented restructuring. 
  The State Council gave final approval for a programme 
spelling out more specifically what tax collectors can do to 
gather revenues, the State Administration of Taxation said. 
  The State Council, China's cabinet, wants tax collectors to 
have broader authority in order to increase State revenue and 
better regulate the market economy. 
  Tax collectors are also asked to foster a growing sense of 
tax obligations among the public. 
  Although the country's tax revenues registered steady growth 
in recent years, tax collectors still struggle with tax evaders, 
among them both enterprises and individuals. 
  The administration seeks to speed up tax collection and help 
sustain fast and healthy development of the national economy. 
  The administration will increase its involvement in drafting 
tax laws, regulations and detailed rules, and studying, 
improving and implementing the tax reform programme. 
  The changes are also expected to strengthen the role of 
taxation in carrying out national industrial policies, 
readjusting the economic structure, and more rationally 
allocating resources to ensure fair competition. 
  The goal is to establish a standardized and more rational 
tax 
collection system. 
  By the end of February, the country's industrial and 
commercial tax revenue increased 32.2 per cent from the 
corresponding period of last year.

<F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "Resolutely Dealing Blows at </F>
Crimes, and Preserving Social Stability"] 
  [Text] Courts in our province have openly announced court 
judgments on a number of criminal cases, and some criminal 
elements guilty of seriously breaking the criminal law and 
harming the society have been duly punished by the law. This is 
an important measure for implementing the relevant spirit of the 
central authorities in our province and strengthening the attack 
on severe crimes. It is of great significance to preserving 
social stability, consolidating and developing the present 
favorable situation of stability and unity, ensuring smooth 
progress in reform, opening up, and economic construction, and 
protecting the lives, property, and safety of the masses. 
  At present, a handful of criminal elements in society are 
swollen with arrogance and feel reassured and emboldened. Some 
of them waylay or kill persons to seize their goods. Stealing 
has become second nature. Some rape women, or form criminal 
gangs to ride roughshod in their home villages and towns. Some 
criminal elements commit all manner of crimes which make one's 
hair stand on end. Some are economic criminal elements who are 
blinded by greed. They abuse their posts to wantonly practice 
corruption, take bribes, and harm the interests of the state and 
collectives. All this criminal activity has severely 
jeopardized society and obstructed the smooth progress of 
reform, opening up and economic construction. They are a social 
hindrance to deepening reform and speeding up development. The 
masses clap and cheer when these criminal elements are 
prosecuted and heavily punished according to law. 
  We need a fine social environment to carry out reform and 
opening up and to develop our socialist market economy. Social 
stability is the foundation for smooth progress in all work. 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping points out: "Without a stable 
environment, we can achieve nothing. We will even lose those 
achievements which have been scored." Recently, central leading 
comrades have repeatedly stressed that we must pay attention to 
the overall situation of the work of the entire party, correctly 
handle relations between reform, development and stability, and 
ensure social and political stability. With the continuous 
deepening of reform and opening up, our task of preserving 
social stability has become increasingly important. Party 
organizations at all levels throughout the province must 
conscientiously implement our strategic guidelines of "doing two 
types of work simultaneously and attaching equal importance to 
both." They must proceed from the overall situation of the 
great cause of modernization to understand the importance of 
maintaining social stability. On the one hand, we must continue 
to uphold the principle of "dealing heavy blows to crime" to 
severely and promptly crack those unrepentant criminals guilty 
of crimes for which even death is insufficient punishment, 
criminal gangs which severely harm the society, serious economic 
crimes, and arch criminal elements who despise social morality 
and laws and wantonly trample on our residents' life and 
property. This will embody the deterrent role of our laws and 
the great power of our people's democratic dictatorship. On the 
other hand, we must persist in doing well in comprehensive 
management of public security, and attach importance to cracking 
and preventing crimes and bringing about temporary and permanent 
solutions with emphasis on permanent solutions. 
  Establishing a socialist market economic system is a new 
undertaking and a magnificent, systematic project as well. It 
needs coordination and cooperation from various quarters. It 
needs a fine social environment and effective legal protection. 
The faster we speed up the pace of reform and opening up, the 
greater efforts we must exert to crack various kinds of criminal 
activities and preserve social stability and unity. As long as 
we make unremitting efforts and truly "do two types of work 
simultaneously and attach equal importance to both," our reform, 
opening up, and modernization will progress in a still faster 
and better manner.

  [Text] The Society for Research of Party Building of 
Shandong Province was inaugurated in Jinan on 13 May. Jiang 
Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, attended 
the inaugural meeting to extend congratulations and make a 
speech. He stressed: We should positively conduct joint 
research for the theory of party building by focusing on the 
difficult problems with regard to the overall situation of the 
whole party as well as the work of party building. We should 
also strive to achieve as more results as possible at an earlier 
date in order to make due contributions to promoting the 
province's economic construction and the development of all 
undertakings. 
  The Society for Research of Party Building of Shandong 
Province is a mass academic organization. Its purpose is to 
conduct a profound research for the major practical and 
theoretical questions concerning party building in reform, 
opening up, and modernization with a view to facilitating party 
building and economic construction of Shandong, under the 
guidance of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and the theory 
of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics, and by 
centering on the party's basic line. 
  The society invited Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, and Li Farong, veteran comrade of 
the province, as its honorary directors, and elected Li Wenquan, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, as its 
deputy director. 
  The inaugural meeting was presided over by Comrade Li 
Wenquan. Comrade Jiang Chunyun said in his speech: The 
inauguration of this society is a major event in the political 
life of the province. The society will certainly play a 
positive role in further strengthening the research and 
propaganda of the theory of party building, in achieving success 
in party building, and in promoting the development of all 
undertakings of the province. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: We should persistently use 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building the socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to guide the research and practice of 
party building. This society should give first priority to 
studying, researching, and propagating the theory advocated by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping. At the moment, we should lay emphasis on 
studying well Volume Three of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" and on profoundly comprehending the essence of the 
guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory with a view to 
truly studying, mastering, propagating, and applying this theory 
well. At the same time, we should integrate the study of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory with the study of 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, the study of guidelines of 
the 14th National Party Congress and the third session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, and the study of theory of market 
economy and the knowledge concerning modern science and 
technology in an effort to improve our political and theoretical 
expertise and our skill to control the socialist market economy. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: We should conduct research for 
party building closely around the implementation of the party's 
basic line. Like others, the work of party building and the 
research of the theory of party building must always be guided 
by the party's basic line. Practice proves that it will not do 
to merely grasp party building without economic construction, 
and it will also not do to merely grasp the economy regardless 
of party building. We must permeate the process of upholding 
the party's basic line with all the activities of strengthening 
and improving party building. We must use the practical results 
in implementing the party's basic line to examine and evaluate 
the performance of party building work and the research of party 
building theory. As indicated by the CPC Central Committee, the 
general task for the whole party is to seize the opportunity, 
deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote 
development, and maintain stability. Comrades of this society 
must clearly understand this general task and consciously 
subject themselves to it. Comrades of the society should also 
persist in the good study style of integrating theory with 
practice and attend to party building work by profoundly 
researching, answering, and resolving the current new problems 
facing party building work. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: We should continue to raise the 
level of the research of party building theory. The practice of 
party building urgently needs the guidance of party building 
theory and has set new and even higher demands on the research 
of party building theory. The vast numbers of party building 
theoretical and practical workers must conscientiously study the 
party building theory covered by Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong 
Thought and, in particular, study well the series of theoretical 
viewpoints and important ideas offered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
for the building of the ruling party in order to master the 
ideological weapon for achieving success in party building and 
in the research of party building theory. At the same time, we 
should energetically encourage the practice of conducting 
investigations and studies and go deep into the realities of 
life, the grass-roots units, and the midst of the masses to 
conscientiously summarize experiences gained from practice. 
Then, we should strive to find out regular things from these 
experiences, turn these regular things to rational knowledge, 
and use this rational knowledge to guide practice. We should 
conduct explorations and studies with a reformative and 
pioneering spirit and with a scientific and realistic attitude 
with a view to constantly raising the level of party building 
and the research of party building theory. 
  Jiang Chunyun demanded that attention should be paid to 
building the party building theoretical contingent. The 
province has already been furnished with a sizable party 
building theoretical contingent engaged in party affairs work 
and theoretical research. Generally speaking, this contingent 
is good in quality and has made positive contributions to 
carrying out reform, opening up, economic construction, and 
party building. However, this contingent is not strong enough 
become some comrades are not solid in theoretical foundation, 
are unexperienced in practice, and need further improvement in 
their foresight of work, their guidance to practice, and their 
quality of research. The organizational coordination of this 
contingent also need further improvement. Therefore, we should 
firmly and conscientiously grasp the building of this contingent 
by regarding it as a major task. Party committees at all levels 
in the province should attach importance to building this 
contingent by setting strict demands on in politically, giving 
vigorous support to it in work, showing concern for it in 
livelihood, and creating good working environment and conditions 
for it in order to raise the research of party building theory 
to a new level.

  [Text] The fifth enlarged meeting of the committee for 
compiling and examining the history of the Shandong column of 
the Eighth Route Army was held in Jinan on 25 May. This meeting 
was primarily devoted to discussing, revising, and examining the 
first draft of the history of Shandong column of the Eighth 
Route Army. Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, and Song Qingwei, political commissar of the Jinan 
Military Region, attended the meeting and made speeches. 
  At the meeting, Jiang Chunyun introduced the province's 
situation in economic and social development to the compiling 
committee and the veteran comrades specially invited to the 
meeting. With regard to the compiling of the history, Jiang 
Chunyun said: Compiling this history is of great significance, 
and a far-reaching influence will be produced. Through the 
research, compilation, and propagation of this history, we will 
enable the vast numbers of party members, cadres, and the 
masses, youths and juveniles in particular, to receive a 
profound education on patriotism, revolutionary tradition, and 
the fine tradition of the party. Successful compilation of this 
history is not only a summarization of the glorious history of 
Shandong in fighting the war of resistance against Japan, but 
also a practical need to build the two civilizations. 
  Jiang Chunyun demanded: The compilation committee should 
organically combine the abundant historical data with correct 
viewpoints with a rigorous and painstaking approach. The 
committee should strive to make the viewpoints of this history 
correct, the historical facts accurate, and the content logic 
and rich in order to make it authentic, reliable, and 
educational historical records with good ideological content and 
attain the goals of clarifying historical facts, providing 
political consultations, and educating the people.

  [Text] The joint organization for production, processing, 
and marketing of agricultural products of counties and cities 
was formally established in Laiyang on 22 May. This is 
Shandong's first transregional agricultural economic 
organization with the nature of association voluntarily 
organized by Laiyang, Laixi, Changle, Shouguang, Yushu, suburban 
Taian, and Jinxiang counties and cities. 
  It is learned that all of these seven counties and cities -- 
the executive members of this organization -- are the province's 
backbone bases to produce, process, and export agricultural 
products. The vegetable exported and processed by these 
counties and cities alone accounts for more than one third of 
the country's total. In addition, more than 50 enterprises and 
bases in Zhejinag, Henan, Liaoning, and two other provinces have 
joined this organization as ordinary members. This joint 
organization will certainly exert a tremendous influence on 
agricultural produce markets at home and abroad. 
  Xiao Wanjun, deputy director of the Central Policy Research 
Center, and Wang Jiangong, vice governor of Shandong Province, 
made a special trip to the county to attend the inaugural 
meeting and make speeches. Wang Jiangong was invited to serve 
as honorary director of the organization. And the general 
office of the provincial government, the provincial agricultural 
commission, the provincial planning commission, the provincial 
foreign economic relations and trade commission, and 10 other 
units were invited to be advisers of the organization. The 
people have generally regarded the establishment of this 
organization as a new move of Shandong and even China in 
developing the production, processing, and marketing of 
agricultural products on an even wider scale and at an even 
higher level. The people have also regarded it as an essential 
trend of development of the rural market economy. 
  (Mu Yutai), secretary of the Laiyang City Party Committee, 
initiator of this joint organization, and executive chairman of 
the first committee of this organization, said: In line with 
the principle of voluntary cooperation, by jointly handling 
affairs, conducting economic consultation, and issuing journals 
of the organization, this organization will commonly analyze the 
agricultural produce markets at home and abroad and circulate 
the notice on the amount, variety, and quotas of the production, 
processing, and marketing of respective agricultural products 
and on the distribution of agricultural products on markets. 
This organization will also conduct the exchanges of sciences, 
technologies, funds, professionals, and management experiences 
and will subject itself to the guidance and supervision by the 
government in order to avoid overlapping construction and 
overlapping import of agricultural products and the unlawful 
competitions between different areas. This organization will 
also go beyond the limits of administrative divisions to help 
optimize the distribution of natural resources, readjust the 
structure of agricultural products, and push the province's 
agricultural and sideline products to the domestic and 
international markets in an all-round manner.

<F P=106> [By reporters Chen Maodi (7115 3029 1717) and Zou Aiguo </F>
(6760 1947 0948)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- While inspecting 
Shanghai 23-25 May, State Council Premier Li Peng pointed out: 
Developing and opening up Pudong is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
major decision and is a need for the country's overall 
development. The entire country must support Pudong's 
development and opening up, and Pudong must serve reform, 
opening up, and economic development in the entire country. 
  Premier Li Peng visited Shanghai after concluding his 
inspection of Jiangsu. Accompanied by Wu Bangguo, member of the 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the 
Shanghai municipal party committee, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, 
Li Peng inspected the New Pudong District and Yangpu Bridge and 
held a discussion meeting with Shanghai comrades. 
  Since the party Central Committee and the State Council 
decided in 1990 to develop and open up Pudong, Li Peng has 
visited Shanghai every year to inspect the New Pudong District's 
development and construction. Currently, initial success has 
been achieved in developing the district. By the end of last 
year, the district had accumulated over 3,100 domestic 
investments and over 1,600 direct foreign investments, as well 
as agreements on the use of $3.27 billion in foreign funds. Li 
Peng was pleased with the new progress. 
  Li Peng pointed out: Shanghai is the seaport for the very 
long Chang Jiang. It has a vast hinterland, a strong industrial 
base and superiority in personnel, developed commercial 
establishments, and convenient transportation. We must make 
full use of these favorable conditions to build Shanghai into an 
international economic, financial, and trade center. He said: 
The central authorities' decision to develop and open up Pudong 
is unswerving. Because the district's development is currently 
in the construction stage, the central authorities still need to 
support its development through their policy, and they will 
maintain continuity in the policies for Pudong's development and 
opening up. Following the establishment of the socialist market 
economy, these policies will be gradually standardized and, 
based on China's actual situation, constructive study will be 
conducted. He said: To build Shanghai into an international 
economic, financial, and trade center, it is still necessary to 
vigorously develop international shipping to form an 
international and domestic transportation network that links all 
areas. It is possible for Shanghai to become an international 
shipping center through harnessing the Chang Jiang. He pointed 
out: To become a trade center, it is necessary to open up more 
local and external trade channels as well as to train a large 
group of experts in international trade. 
  Li Peng affirmed Shanghai's industrial restructuring policy 
of "vigorously developing tertiary industry, readjusting and 
upgrading secondary industry, and strengthening primary 
industry." He pointed out: To build Shanghai into an 
international financial center, we must vigorously develop 
tertiary industry, particularly finance, trade, and shipping, to 
serve economic development in the entire Chang Jiang Valley and 
even the whole country. We must upgrade the structure of 
secondary industry and embark on constructing some large 
export-oriented projects of high and new technology to form a 
new pillar industry. As a large industrial city, agriculture 
should be given equal importance and strengthened, and it is 
necessary to effectively tackle the "vegetable basket" project. 
Village and town enterprises in Shanghai's suburbs must support 
agriculture by acting as stable agricultural production bases 
for the city proper. He expressed hope that Shanghai would 
continue to perfect the "321" policy [not further identified] in 
practice. Li Peng also affirmed Shanghai's plans to remodel old 
city areas. 
  Speaking about Shanghai's socialist spiritual civilization, 
Li Peng stressed: It is necessary to give more publicity to 
workers, peasants, cadres, and intellectuals who possess a 
sacrificing spirit and a lofty moral character. As for the 
encouraging changes in young Shanghai students' spiritual 
outlook, Li Peng said: The fact that the vast number of our 
country's young students have combined their own future with the 
motherland's destiny indicates that there is great hope for the 
vast number of young people and our great motherland. He said: 
As long as we unswervingly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
submit ourselves to the leadership of the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and do practical 
work, Shanghai will definitely realize its magnificent goal. 
  Persons in charge of relevant State Council departments who 
accompanied the inspection included Chen Jinhua, He Chunlin, Liu 
Jiang, Huang Zhendong, and Jiang Yunbao.

  [Text] Shanghai, 6 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The migrant 
population in Shanghai is increasing substantially. According 
to a recent survey, three-quarters of the migrants in Shanghai 
came to seek jobs or do business. This reflects Shanghai's 
rapid economic development and benign environment for doing 
business. 
  The survey showed that people moving into and out of 
Shanghai 
numbered 3.31 million in the past year. In particular, 2.81 
million people moved into Shanghai and 0.5 million people moved 
out. The total number of migrants increased by 1.22 million as 
compared with 2.09 million in 1988. According to statistics, 
74.3 percent of the migrants moved into Shanghai for various 
economic purposes; 0.8 percent of the people came to Shanghai 
for such cultural purposes as receiving education and training; 
24.5 percent came to visit friends and relatives, make 
sightseeing tours, or seek medical treatment; and visitors for 
other purposes accounted for 0.4 percent. 
  The relevant department in Shanghai held that the increase 
in 
the migrant population brought economic and labor resources to 
the city, but, at the same time, it also produced certain 
negative effects on Shanghai's public security, transportation, 
environment, and residents' daily lives. People of insight have 
urged the authorities concerned to solve the new problems caused 
by the inflow of migrants as soon as possible.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (CNS) -- According to a sample 
survey by the Shanghai Municipal Foreign Economic and Trade 
Commission, the Municipal Legislative Office and the Municipal 
Administration of Industry and Commerce on 727 foreign 
institutions in the city, over 1,200 employees have been 
illegally hired by their employers. Regarding this problem, 
entities set up by Taiwan and Hong Kong businessmen are the most 
serious. 
  The investigation shows that small-sized foreign-funded 
companies have heavily involved in the above mentioned 
activities. Employees working in these institutions and 
companies, owing to failure of obtaining protection from labour 
departments of the local governments, are generally earning a 
comparatively low salary and even facing a threat of being 
dismissed when they pass their best period of age. And because 
of short of backing by an organizational institution, their 
lawful rights and interests including pensions, medical charges, 
insurance of unemployment, labour insurance for their families 
and allowance for dismissal have also not been guaranteed. [as

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Abounding in natural 
maritime resources, Zhejiang Province is boosting fishing, 
industry, foreign trade and tourism, and building more ports. 
  A provincial official said that Zhejiang will draw on the 
experience of other provinces and overseas in the development of 
its maritime economy, and encourage people to tap the natural 
resources under the principle of "those who invest in and 
develop the economy will benefit from it." 
  With a vast population but limited territory, Zhejiang has 
2,100 islands with combined coastlines of more than 6,300 km. 
  Its rapid economic development with poor natural resources 
on 
land has forced the province to focus on the ocean. 
  So far, Zhejiang has set up eight breeding bases for aquatic 
products, and sent more than 100 ocean-going ships to the 
Pacific Ocean to catch fish, and process and sell it in 
neighboring countries. 
  Last year saw the province reap a good fishing harvest for 
the tenth year running. It caught 1.56 million tons of aquatic 
products and exported 200 million U.S. dollars-worth of them. 
  According to the official, localities in Zhejiang have spent 
more than 300 million yuan on building 35 ports and docks over 
the past five years. 
  At present, Zhejiang has a total of 58 sea ports, which have 
relations with more than 200 ports overseas. 
  The province has formed an integrated group of ports with 
Ningbo and Zhoushan as the centers. 
  The power industry is developing alongside the port 
construction, according to the official, as state enterprises 
have invested more than 10 billion yuan in this field over the 
past five years. 
  So far, a number of power plants have gone into operation. 
Included are the Beilun Power Plant, Jiaxing Power Plant and 
Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, which have helped the province to 
raise its power-generating capacity by more than 40 percent. 
  In addition, the province is making full use of wind, water 
and tidal power to generate electricity. 
  Being an up-and-coming area in tapping ocean resources, 
Zhejiang has improved tourist facilities and services to attract 
more tourists from overseas. 
  Islands that have opened to tourists at home and abroad 
include Putuo mountain, one of China's four sacred places of 
Buddhism, and the Chengsi isles, known as the "Oriental Hawaii". 
  A survey shows that the number of visitors to these islands 
had increased to more than two million last year. 
  The official noted that the discovery of oil and natural gas 
deposits in the east China sea has enhanced the provincial 
government's determination to expand the oceanic economy. 
  About 20 trans-national corporations from Europe and America 
have come to the offshore areas off Wenzhou, Zhejiang, to 
prospect for crude oil and natural gas since last year. 
  "All this indicates that Zhejiang's maritime economy is in 
the ascendant," the official said.

<F P=106> [Special dispatch by staff reporter Chiang Chao-yung (5592 </F>
0340 0516): "Sichuan Party Secretary Xie Shijie Says Foreign 
Investors in Sichuan Must Be Allowed To Make Profits"] 
  [Text] Chengdu, 29 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- While meeting with 
Hong Kong and Macao reporters here today, Xie Shijie, secretary 
of the Sichuan CPC Committee, said: Sichuan must seize the 
opportunity to open up wider to the outside world and accelerate 
its development. While urging cadres at all localities to 
cooperate with foreign investors, he told them not to be too 
calculating. They should allow foreign investors to make a 
profit and increase investment returns. 
  Secretary Xie said: If you want to find a latent market with 
a population of 110 million in the world today, besides Sichuan, 
there is no other choice. This is the reason large overseas 
groups have focused their attention on Sichuan. Sichuan must 
seize this golden opportunity and change its ideological 
concepts. Some localities always think too much about their own 
interests, leaving little for foreign investors. This will make 
it difficult for us to attain the goal of attracting foreign 
investors. 
  Xie stated: Emancipation of mind is substantial and opening 
up wider is specific. 
  There were no transactions in the auction sales of state 
enterprises in Hong Kong. Some people want to cast off their 
burdens. If foreign investors cannot make any profit, they 
prefer running new enterprises to buying old ones. We will 
continue to sell enterprises this year, turn fixed assets into 
movable ones, and invest money in new fields. 
  A reporter asked about the race-course and gambling city in 
Wenjiang county, which were banned. Xie Shijie explained that 
there is no gambling city in Wenjiang. Instead, there is a 
"lucky city," with a few slot machines. A handful of people 
there want to develop gambling. But state regulations do not 
allow unplanned development of gambling. If it has started, it 
should be improved under leadership and in an organized way. It 
should be well under control and be run well. Efforts are being 
made in this regard, applications are submitted to relevant 
state departments, and measures are adopted to that they will 
function well. There is now a motorcycle race in Wenjiang, and 
it will not affect Taiwan investment there. Except Wuhan, 
Wenjiang has attracted the largest amount of Taiwan investment. 
The state will soon approve a state- level investment zone in 
Wenjiang for Taiwan investors. 
  Because of inflation, Xie Shijie also disclosed, some 10 to 
15 percent of the university and college students have financial 
difficulties. The Mianyang Changhong Television Factory has 
donated 10 million yuan and Hong Kong's Jialing Company has 
donated 4 million yuan to help students resolve their financial 
difficulties. 
  Xie also disclosed that Thailand's Bank of Bangkok and 
Singapore's Union Bank have set up offices in Chengdu.

Opening Up Before Official Visit to the United States"] 
  [Text] Chengdu, 22 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--At the 
invitation of Washington State Governor Mr. Mike Lowry, Xie 
Shijie, senior adviser to the Sichuan Provincial People's 
Government, today left China for a friendly visit to Washington 
State, Michigan, New York City, and Los Angeles, where he will 
negotiate cooperation projects. Before he left, Xie Shijie 
granted a special interview to the reporters from this news 
agency. 
  "Expanding opening up to the outside world is Sichuan 
Province's top priority this year, and my trip to the United 
States this time is mainly to enhance understanding, foster 
friendship, seek extensive contacts with the people from all 
walks of life in the United States, and expedite Sichuan's 
opening up to the outside world." Xie Shijie came directly to 
the purpose of his trip to the United States. 
  Xie Shijie said that Sichuan Province established friendly 
province-state relations with Washington State and Michigan in 
October and November 1982 respectively. In the past 12 years, 
Sichuan Province's friendship and cooperation with the two 
states has continuously strengthened. During the trip this 
time, discussions will be carried out with Washington State on 
further strengthening economic and scientific cooperation, and 
on developing friendly province-state relations, with Boeing 
Company and some electronic companies, on agricultural 
cooperation between the province and the state, and on food 
processing, exchange of fine seeds for farming, and exchange of 
technology of low-toxic pesticides; ideas will be exchanged on 
strengthening thorough cooperation between the medium and small 
cities in Washington State and in Sichuan Province; discussions 
will be carried out with the Washington State Zoo on 
establishing a foundation for protection of the giant pandas and 
launching cooperation to rescue this endangered species. 
  Xie Shijie said that while in Michigan, he will visit the 
General Motors Company, and carry out discussions with the state 
government on the automobile industry, processing of farm 
products, and transformation of old towns. 
  The humble and pragmatic Xie Shijie has worked in the 
Sichuan 
Provincial People's Government for many years, serving as vice 
governor and executive vice governor; in April 1993, he began to 
serve as party secretary of Sichuan Province, overseeing overall 
work in Sichuan Province. 
  Talking about the major measures to expand Sichuan's opening 
up this year, he said that Sichuan Province is situated in the 
interior and has a vast area and 110 million people, 10 percent 
of China's population; this is a huge market, and the potential 
of this huge market is recognized by knowledgeable persons at 
home and abroad. Sichuan Province's chemical, electronic, and 
metallurgical industries rank first in China; Sichuan's space 
technology is famous at home and overseas; and its abundant farm 
products and cheap labor resource are also a strong point when 
Sichuan opens up to the outside world. 
  Xie Shijie said: The basic way to expedite Sichuan's 
economic development and narrow the difference between it and 
the coastal provinces and cities rests on reform and opening up. 
In order to increase the weight of Sichuan's opening up to the 
outside world, beginning in Chengdu on 28 June this year, an 
international conference on Sichuan's opening up to the outside 
world plus an investment forum will be held, and during that 
period, 306 projects involving a total investment of $13 billion 
will be offered for negotiations with foreign businessmen. In 
addition, a number of measures to expand opening up to the 
outside world, including the transfer of rights to use 
Chengdu-Chongqing Highway and the right to use state-owned 
enterprises, will be promulgated one by one. 
  Coming to this point, Xie Shijie said that American 
consortia, bankers, and entrepreneurs are welcome in Chengdu to 
participate in the international conference on Sichuan's opening 
up to the outside world plus the investment forum. 
  While in New York, Xie Shijie will also have contacts with 
the persons of American financial and securities circles, hold 
talks with the Sino-U.S. Trade Commission, and inspect 
development of Sichuan's enterprises in New York. When in Los 
Angeles, talks will be held with American entrepreneurs... 
  According to information, the number of American investors 
coming to Sichuan has continuously increased, for example, the 
Mcgill Group and the American Concord Group in Chengdu, and the 
plating membrane production line under construction in Shuangliu 
County--the largest in western China--as well as a 
pharmaceutical factory in Guanghan.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 KYODO -- Foreign tourists in Lhasa, 
Tibet, reported Thursday [26 May] that four Tibetan monks were 
detained on Tuesday after shouting proindependence slogans near 
the city center. 
  Police near the famous Johkang Temple in Barkhor Square 
immediately descended on the monks, knocking some of them to the 
ground before taking them away in police vehicles at about 9 
A.M. Tuesday, witnesses said. 
  On May 25, the Buddhist festival of Sagothawa is held. 
Traditionally, it attracts monks to the Johkang to pray. On May 
23 last year, an estimated 4,000 Buddhist monks and nuns staged 
independence demonstrations. 
  According to witnesses, the police presence has been heavy 
in 
the city over the last several days and passengers on all buses 
coming into Lhasa are having their identification papers checked. 
  Several monks arriving in the city are believed to have been 
turned back by police at bus stations, the witnesses said.

<F P=106> [By reporters Ning Shiqun (1337 0013 5028) and Duo Qiong </F>
(1122 4522)] 
  [Text] Lhasa, 24 May (XINHUA) -- Through 15 years of 
reform and opening up, a trend of accelerated development has 
emerged on the Tibetan highland, the roof of the world. As of 
the end of 1993, the total annual output value of goods and 
services reached 3.65 billion yuan, a growth of over 120 percent 
over that of 1980. 
  In the past 15 years, Tibet Autonomous Region has adopted a 
long-term and unchanged policy of allowing households 
self-operation rights in using land as well as raising and 
owning livestock. This has greatly aroused the production 
enthusiasm of peasants and herdsmen, who form over 80 percent of 
the Tibetan population. The region has reaped bumper harvest in 
agricultural production for six consecutive years. Last year, 
the total agricultural output value topped 2.32 billion yuan, a 
growth of 66 percent over the total of 15 years' ago; and total 
grain production reached 620,000 tonnes, a growth of 30.69 
percent. With per capita income reaching 521 yuan, living 
conditions for the majority of peasants and herdsmen have 
improved. The total output value of village and town 
enterprises and income from various economic sectors have grown 
by fairly large margins, reaching 100 million yuan and 240 
million yuan respectively. 
  The late start and slow development of Tibet's 
infrastructure 
construction in industries, transportation, energy resources, 
and communications has consistently hampered the speed of 
economic development. Through 15 years' of hard work, Tibet's 
total industrial output value has reached 535 million yuan, a 
growth of 78.65 percent over that of 1980. The production 
volume of principal products has grown by a large margin, and 
the rate of qualified and excellent products has increased 
somewhat. The production-sales ratio has reached 94.85 percent. 
Smooth progress has been made in a large group of key 
infrastructures construction projects in energy resources, 
transportation, and communications. In 1993 alone, Tibet 
invested 1.59 billion yuan in fixed assets. The region expanded 
the main runways of Gonggar and Bangda airports; built the 
Zhamu-Medog road; began work on the Yanghu and Calung power 
plants; and conducted geothermal exploration in northern 
Yangbajing, as well as embarked on key infrastructures 
construction projects that included 61 earth satellite 
communications stations, 35 county-built earth satellite 
communications stations, and computerized telephone 
installations. These projects laid a solid foundation for 
Tibet's rapid economic development. 
  With accelerated pace and increased intensity of Tibet's 
opening up to the outside world, the rapid development of 
Tibet's foreign trade and tourist industry has injected new 
vitality into its entire economy. Last year, the import-export 
volume of Tibet's foreign trade reached 103 million yuan, a 
524-percent increase over that of 1980. The tourist industry 
has developed from nothing to become Tibet's pillar industry. 
The region received 23,000 tourists from Hong Kong, Macao, 
Taiwan, and foreign countries, an over 20-fold growth over that 
of 1980. Total operations income reached 106 million yuan, with 
foreign exchange earnings amounting to $9 million. Meanwhile, 
the momentum in attracting local and foreign investment 
continued well. In 1993 alone, the region attracted local and 
foreign investments in 41 projects, with agreements on using 
67.11 million yuan and $9.63 million. In addition, the region 
established 129 independent or joint-funded enterprises with 
other provinces and regions along the coastal regions. 
  Meanwhile, Tibet has quickened the pace of market 
construction and gradually improved market facilities. Last 
year, the region completed 23 new or remodeled country markets, 
and the region's total retail sales amounted to 1.9 billion 
yuan, a growth of 12.8 percent over that of 1992. As a result, 
markets thrived and purchases and sales were brisk in local 
townships and villages.

  [Text] Lhasa, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The expansion of 
telecommunications in the Tibet Autonomous Region has exceeded 
the development pace of the local economy over the past decade. 
  "This has paved the way for the rapid regional economic 
development," said a regional official. 
  Nowadays, it is easy to find a telephone either on a street 
or in a hotel. Mobile phones and radio pagers are commonly seen 
in this capital of the region. 
  According to Xu Dingyuan, deputy director of the city 
telecommunications bureau, the region has telephone exchanges 
with a combined capacity of about 30,000 lines at present, up 
from only 50 lines in the 1950s and 300 lines in the 1970s. 
  "The telephone capacity will surpass 40,000 lines next 
year," 
he said. 
  At present, the telephone capacity in Lhasa tops 15,000 
lines. That means every 10 people can have a telephone. 
  Located on the "roof of the world", Tibet plans to expand 
its 
satellite ground stations from the present 56 to 80 to further 
link its remote areas with other parts of the country and the 
rest of the world. 
  Xu attributed the rapid development of telecommunications in 
the region to the support of the state, other provinces and 
overseas. 
  He explained that the state has allocated 200 million yuan 
to 
Tibet in this field in the 1991-1995 period, and Lhasa's first 
5,000-line program-controlled telephone exchange has been sent 
by the Belgian Government as a gift.

  [Text] At a provincial township and town enterprise work 
conference convened yesterday, provincial party committee 
Secretary Pu Chaozhu emphatically called for actively exploring 
new ways of ensuring sustained and high-rate township and town 
enterprise growth across the province. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu pointed out: Since 1993, the province's 
township and town enterprises have extricated themselves from 
protracted stagnation and slow growth and started embarking on a 
multilevel rapid growth, with the result that their total income 
topped 21 billion yuan in 1993, up by 71 percent over the year 
before. Moreover, in the January-April period of this year, the 
province's township and town enterprises still witnessed 
sustained and high-rate growth, with the result that their total 
income in the period registered a 67 percent increase over the 
corresponding period of last year. The province's total 
township and town enterprise income is expected to have topped 
33 billion yuan by the end of the year. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: Nevertheless, we should not be 
overly optimistic about the existing achievements. Rather, we 
should make continued efforts to work hard to secure an average 
annual increase of 50 percent or more in the province's township 
and town enterprise income. Only by so doing will we be able to 
narrow the gap between the country's economically developed 
regions and Yunnan Province and bring about a comparatively 
comfortable livelihood across the province. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu put forth the following four specific 
views on ensuring sustained and high-rate township and town 
enterprise growth in the province: 
  1. It is imperative to further emancipate the mind and 
acquire a clearer understanding of the strategic importance of 
township and town enterprise development. To this end, all 
levels and departments concerned across the province should 
strengthen coordination, cooperation, and determination with a 
view to securing high-rate township and town enterprise growth 
across the province for several years to come and raising 
township and town enterprise output value to over 70 percent of 
the province's total rural output value. Under no 
circumstances, Pu Chaozhu noted, should we err in this regard. 
  2. It is imperative to seek truth from facts and suit 
measures to local conditions. To this end, the province should 
first and foremost concentrate on developing several primary 
industries with an eye on building about 10 backbone local 
industries with output value exceeding 100 million yuan each 
over the next seven to 10 years. 
  3. Deep-going reforms have all along been the motive force 
behind sustained and high-rate township and town enterprise 
development. The township and town enterprises across the 
province should first try to implement a joint-stock system on a 
trial basis; ensure compensated transfer to peasants or 
collectives of such rights as exploiting, managing, and using 
exploitable barren hills, slopes, shores, and fields without 
altering the existing ownership system; actively readjust the 
ownership system structure; push ahead with individual economic 
and private enterprise development; bring about a balanced 
growth of state-owned, collective, and individual economies; and 
sell, lease, amalgamate, or privatize small state-owned 
enterprises in various counties, thereby invigorating this group 
of small enterprises and turning them into private enterprises 
in terms of ownership and management. 
  4. It is imperative to strengthen leadership over township 
and town enterprises. To this end, party committees and 
people's governments should be bold in taking risks, undertaking 
responsibility, and proceeding from actual conditions. All 
areas across the province should take township and town 
enterprise development as an important criterion for appraising 
work done by party and government cadres; establish a 
responsibility system under which party and government cadres 
are required to attain clear-cut goals regarding township and 
town enterprise development; award cadres who have contributed 
to such development and punish cadres who have failed in pushing 
such development forward; and strive to mobilize enthusiasm 
among the broad masses of cadres and people of all nationalities 
across the province in promoting township and town enterprise 
development.

<F P=106> [By reporter Na Jiahua (4780 1367 7520): "China Sets Up </F>
First Complaints Telephone Hotline For Staff Members and 
Workers"] 
  [Text] Kunming, 28 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Shi Yi, 
president of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, 
made an announcement to reporters here today that the complaints 
telephone hotline for staff members and workers, a first in 
China, which has been installed jointly by the federation and 
its subsidiary in the offices of the magazine SHIDAI FENGCAI 
[ELEGANT DEMEANOR OF THE TIMES], will become operative in 
Kunming as of 1 May. 
  According to his briefing, the purpose of the complaints 
telephone hotline for staff members and workers, dubbed the 
"4155457 golden link," is to act on behalf of staff members and 
workers, be devoted to their affairs, and help solve their 
difficulties and warm their hearts. The matters to be handled 
by the hotline include suggestions and opinions on the policy of 
reform and opening up to the outside world, and in particular 
the establishment of a modern enterprise system, encroachments 
on staff members' and workers' legitimate rights and interests, 
and the practical difficulties facing staff members and workers 
in the course of reform; their reports of corrupt practices and 
cases of violation of law and disciplinary codes; policy 
consultancy regarding their immediate interests; consultancy 
regarding their daily life concerns; and reporting to them other 
relevant developments and sudden incidents. 
  It is reported that in recent years, while strengthening the 
work of handling people's letters and visits, the Yunnan 
Provincial Federation of Trade Unions has introduced a president 
reception day system and opened a "Complaints Path" column in 
the magazine SHIDAI FENGCAI.

<F P=106> ["Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Further on </F>
Qiandao Lake Pleasure Boat Case"] 
  [Text] Dear Brother: 
  The dust kicked up by the Qiandao Lake pleasure boat case 
will soon settle because the case has been cracked, the 
offenders have been arrested, and the truth of the case has been 
clarified. The nature of the case is now very clear: It is a 
robbery, arson, and murder case. The mainland department 
concerned is stepping up relevant interrogation and 
investigations. Relatives of the victims will be invited to 
attend the open trial. After three phone invitations by the 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, the Straits 
Exchange Foundation will send its members and relevant experts 
to Hangzhou to listen to a detailed report on the case. 
  The Qiandao Lake pleasure boat case, which caused trouble 
for 
a month, left behind many problems which warrant careful 
consideration. In my view, when there are increasingly frequent 
contacts and exchanges between the two sides of the strait, 
certain incidents are hardly avoidable. What we must bear in 
mind is that when there is an incident, the departments 
concerned of the two sides should handle the case in a timely 
and proper manner with a view to maintaining and developing 
their good relationship, which has not come about easily. We 
must especially watch out for a few evil-minded people who will 
take advantage of the incident to sow discord between the two 
sides. 
  The Qiandao Lake pleasure boat case is a tragedy, which the 
compatriots on both sides of the strait are loath to see. 
However, we should say that the mainland authorities concerned 
have devoted great efforts to identifying the criminals and 
dealing with the aftermath of the accident. The fact that this 
exceptionally big, vicious case was cracked in no time and that 
the offenders were arrested bears evidence to this. The media 
at home and abroad will make their own fair judgment. 
Naturally, we should derive experience from this incident as 
well as any lessons it provides. 
  All who are concerned about the overall interests of the 
cross-strait relationship should approach the case from every 
angle, in which case they will admit that the Qiandao Lake 
pleasure boat case is like a mirror showing that there are some 
negative, destabilizing factors hindering the expansion of 
cross-strait relations. In Taiwan, there are some people who, 
under the pretense of reflecting the popular will, have taken 
advantage of the case to incite hostility against the mainland, 
calling for the Taiwan Government "to give up the one-China 
policy," thus creating an argument for "Taiwan independence." 
The grief and indignation of the victims' relatives is 
understandable; in fact, the people on both sides of the strait 
feel the same. But some people in Taiwan, who have an axe to 
grind and wish to stir up trouble, added fuel to the fire by 
initiating unreasonable attacks and spreading venomous slander 
against the mainland. They used such abusive language that it 
suggested that they had lost their reason. For a brief period, 
they showered attacks, slander, and invective upon the mainland 
as if the latter might crumble under the mass of dark clouds. 
  Nevertheless, all these attacks and this slander and 
invective have contributed nothing to the solution of the case; 
instead, they have created greater difficulties and jeopardized 
the mutual affection of the people on both sides of the strait. 
In fact there are quite a lot of people with insight on the 
island. They did not agree with the Taiwan authorities' 
emotional statements on the case or with their practice of 
politicizing such a criminal case. They were also greatly 
dissatisfied with the pro-independence forces that used the 
occasion as an opportunity to create a nuisance. Certain 
overseas media warned that in the Qiandao Lake pleasure boat 
case, some among the Taiwan authorities would use the 
"pro-independence forces" as a bargaining chip to "contend with" 
the mainland. Such a trend deserves consideration. 
  It is generally believed that with the trial of the case, 
punishment of the offenders, and further disclosure of the 
details of the case, the dust kicked up will finally settle. We 
hope both sides will draw a lesson from the case, work together 
to increase their mutual trust, and look forward so as to 
promote the development of cross-strait relations. 
  [Signed] Bao Xin

  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- A national meeting to 
present awards for outstanding works that publicized propaganda 
directed at Taiwan was held in Beijing today. 
  Wang Zhaoguo, director of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs 
Office, attended and spoke at the meeting. He said: The work 
on publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan is very important 
in the great cause of reunifying the motherland. Major changes 
have occurred on Taiwan island and in cross-strait relations in 
recent years. Taiwan-related tasks are facing a new situation 
and new issues, which in turn pose new and higher requirements 
for the work that publicizes propaganda directed at Taiwan. 
  Wang Zhaoguo said: At present, the mainland has been making 
very good progress in its reform and opening up. Its economy 
has been developing very rapidly. Taiwan compatriots are very 
interested in the situation. We should, in accordance with 
Taiwan compatriots' requirements, publicize the information in 
various formats to enable them to understand the mainland's 
situation better so as to increase the mainland's rallying and 
centripetal force. 
  Wang Zhaoguo added: To properly handle the work on 
publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan, we need to have a 
contingent of personnel who are politically and professionally 
competent with an upright work style. Leaders of Taiwan affairs 
offices and news and propaganda departments at various levels 
should pay attention to establishing the contingent. Comrades 
engaging in tasks on publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan 
should earnestly and properly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theories on "peaceful reunification and one country and two 
systems"; properly study the party's various general and special 
policies toward Taiwan, and strive to improve their own 
ideological and professional standards. 
  The competition awarded first, second, and third prizes to 
80 
Taiwan-related propaganda essays, to 30 Taiwan-related 
propaganda books, and to 23 Taiwan-related propaganda video 
programs. The meeting also commended 46 outstanding comrades 
who have been industrious and who have cherished their work on 
publicizing propaganda directed at Taiwan. 
  Leaders of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office and 
other relevant departments also attended today's 
award-presentation meeting.

  [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- Taipei on Wednesday [25 
May] suggested that talks with Beijing regarding compensation 
for relatives of the Taiwan victims killed in the Qiandao Lake 
disaster be held early next month. 
  Twenty-four Taiwanese tourists and eight mainland guides and 
crew were robbed and burned to death in the lower-deck cabin of 
a pleasure boat on which they were touring Lake Qiandao in 
Zhejiang Province on March 31. 
  Beijing initially claimed the deaths were accidental, but 
then said robbery and arson were to blame after a blistering 
attack by Taipei questioning the account of the incident. It 
finally arrested four men for their involvement in the crime 
after Taipei implemented a tour-group boycott of the mainland, 
among other measures. 
  In a letter to the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait [ARATS] requesting June talks, the Straits 
Exchange Foundation [SEF], the intermediary body set up to 
handle cross-strait exchanges, said the incident had inflicted 
unprecedented damages on the relationship that had been 
burgeoning since civilian exchanges between the two countries 
began in 1987. 
  SEF insisted in the letter that mainland authorities still 
need to make public a thorough report on the case as soon as 
possible, even though Beijing has said the case is closed. 
  The mainland, it added, should properly compensate the 
victim's relatives, who it said have suffered immensely as a 
result of the tragedy. 
  A SEF delegation, accompanied by lawyers, criminal 
investigators and relatives of the victims, visited the lake and 
met mainland law enforcement officials earlier this month, and 
voiced its doubts about the results of the investigation by 
mainland authorities. 
  In the past two months, ARATS has ignored seven requests by 
SEF to hold talks on the incident, saying it would need more 
time to prepare for negotiations.

  [Text] Taipei is not interested in resuming high-level 
talks with Peking [Beijing] before issues stemming from the 
Chientao [Qiandao] tragedy are settled, the Mainland Affairs 
Council [MAC] has announced. Before issues relating to the 31 
March boat fire in which 24 Taiwanese tourists were killed as 
well as other functional disputes are resolved, Taipei sees no 
reasons of holding another round of chairman-level talks between 
it and the Peking semi-official organization, sources quoted an 
MAC official as saying. The official was apparently referring 
to a meeting between the chairman of the Straits Exchange 
Foundation [SEF], Ku Chen-fu, and his mainland counterpart Wang 
Tao-han [Wang Daohan] of the Association for Relations Across 
the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]. The two chairmen met in the 
ground-breaking Ku-Wang Talks in Singapore last April. At that 
time, they agreed to meet at least once a year to maintain 
regular cross-strait contacts. However, the cabinet-level MAC, 
which formulates Taiwan's policy towards the mainland, asserts 
there is no point in moving on until the current issues are 
finally resolved.

  [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan fishing boats must 
be careful not to venture into foreign waters, a Taiwan 
fisheries official warned Wednesday [25 May]. 
  Li Chien-chuan, director of the Fisheries Department of the 
Council of Agriculture, said that there are currently 117 Taiwan 
fishing boats operating in squid fishing grounds near Argentina. 
He said 42 are licensed by the Falkland Islands, 39 are 
licensed by Argentina, and the remaining 36 have licenses from 
neither Argentina nor the Falkland Islands and can only operate 
in international waters. 
  Li urged the unlicensed ships to stay away from Falkland 
Island and Argentine waters to avoid being attacked. 
  His remarks followed the attack last Friday by the Argentine 
Navy on a Taiwan fishing boat that had allegedly been poaching 
in Argentine waters. 
  The Kaohsiung-based fishing boat, the Chin Yuan Hsing, 
reportedly sank off the coast of San Julian after being 
attacked, and its crewmembers were rescued by another nearby 
Taiwan fishing boat, the Chin Chuan Hsing. 
  Taiwan Government officials are still investigating the 
incident. 
  Li said that the government will take action only after a 
full investigation is completed.

  [Text] The Kaohsiung city criminal police force and the 
Agriculture Council's investigative group yesterday [23 May] 
solved the largest case of illegal ivory sales in the province. 
They seized some 10,000 pieces of finished or semifinished ivory 
products whose value was initially estimated at more than 100 
million new Taiwan [NT] dollars. Here is a report by Huang 
Chien-ping: 
  [Begin recording] [Huang] [sentence indistinct] In the 
afternoon, the Executive Yuan's Wildlife Protection Group and 
the police, acting on the tip, went to the Hsiangyacheng herbal 
medicine shop on Chengkung First Road in Chienchin District, 
Kaohsiung city, to crack down on the illegal trade. They seized 
a large quantity of ivory, including 12 pieces of ivory that had 
not been cut, and some 10,000 pieces of ivory goods. Chang 
Yu-cheng, director of the Agriculture Council's Forestry 
Department, said: 
  [Chang] In Taipei, we solved an illegal smuggling case 
involving more than 1,000 pieces of ivory. Acting on a tip 
provided by an individual, we went to Kaohsiung today and acted 
in concert with the criminal police force. 
  [Huang] Chang Yu-cheng said: According to preliminary 
estimates, the ivory shipment is worth more than NT$100 million. 
The shopowner, Lin Weng-shou, argued that the ivory products in 
his shop were imported legally. The police are still 
determining whether the ivory shipment in question is legal, and 
they are investigating its source and destination. 
  This has been a report by China Broadcasting Corporation 
reporter Huang Chien-ping from Kaohsiung. [end recording]

  [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Wildlife breeders protested 
outside the Council of Agriculture (COA) Thursday [26 May], 
urging the council to allow them to sell the animals they have 
raised. 
  The animal breeders, with animals in tow, gathered outside 
the council to argue against wildlife protection laws which 
prohibit the sale of their animals. 
  The breeders argued that they began to raise the animals 
before the Wildlife Conservation Act, which prohibits the trade 
and use of protected wildlife, was enacted in 1989. 
  They said they depend on the sale of their animals not only 
for themselves but also for their families. 
  Wildlife breeders have voiced their opposition to COA 
regulations on several occasions, but this is the first time 
that they have taken their animals, including a bengal tiger, 
crocodile, masked palm civets, formosa rock monkeys and Formosa 
reeve's muntjacks. 
  The private owners said that all the animals were kept in 
cages and posed no danger to the public. 
  Weng Chin-huo, a tiger breeder, said that private breeders 
have done a lot to promote the conservation of wild animals. He 
complained that the conservationists have completely ignored 
their contribution to wildlife preservation. 
  COA officials said that the revised wildlife conservation 
act, which is now under deliberation in the Legislative Yuan, 
would address the issue. 
  The private owners will March to the American Institute in 
Taiwan, the unofficial US Embassy in Taiwan, to protest US trade 
sanctions against Taiwan for its alleged trade in rhino horns 
and tiger parts. 
  Meanwhile, private breeders of wildlife are struggling to 
deal with the large number of animals they own which are 
protected by the wildlife conservation act. 
  COA statistics showed that there are 128 registered tigers 
in 
Taiwan, of which 79 are privately owned. Most of the tiger 
breeders use bengal tigers. 
  Tiger breeder Weng said he owns seven tigers, up from two in 
1989, and does not know what to do with the now-protected 
animals. 
  COA officials said they have contacted the Trade Record 
Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC) about the 
possibility of returning the tigers to their natural habitats. 
  But the officials said that India and Thailand have refused 
the tigers after concerns about tiger attacks on humans.

  [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- The policy-making Central 
Standing Committee of the ruling Kuomintang Wednesday [25 May] 
approved a proposal to name Liang Kuo-shu, chairman of the 
state-run Chiao Tung Bank, as governor of the Central Bank of 
China (CBC). 
  The appointment will become final upon approval by the 
cabinet. 
  Liang, 64, will succeed Samuel Shieh, whose five-year tenure 
expires next week. He is expected to be sworn in June 1. 
  He previously served as chairman of Chang Hwa Commercial 
Bank, chairman of the First Commercial Bank, deputy governor of 
the Central Bank, and economics professor of National Taiwan 
University. 
  The senior banker graduated from National Taiwan University 
in 1953 and took his master's degree from the university in 
1959. He later pursued advanced studies in the United States, 
where he took both his master's and Ph.D. Degrees from 
Vanderbilt University in Nashville in 1964 and 1970 respectively. 
  Asked to comment on his appointment, Liang pledged that he 
would do his best in his new job and seek transparency in the 
central bank's policy making process. 
  Liang is a well known advocate of Taiwan's financial 
liberalization and internationalization strategy. Market forces 
should be key to the development of financial markets, he said.

  [Text] Madrid, May 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan ranked 12th and 20th 
in the world in terms of service industry imports and exports, 
respectively, in 1992, data released by the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) show. 
  Acccording to OECD tallies, Germany bought U.S.$119 billion 
worth of services in 1992, making it the world's top importer in 
that category. The United States and Japan ranked second and 
third by posting service imports worth U.S.$107.7 billion and 
US$97 billion, respectively. 
  Of the four Southeast Asian "little dragons," Taiwan topped 
the other three by importing U.S.$19.2 billion worth of 
services, ranking 12th in the world. South Korea and Hong Kong 
ranked 17th and 19th with service imports worth U.S.$14.6 
billion and U.S.$12 billion, respectively. Singapore did not 
make the top-20 list. 
  The United States was the leading exporter of services at 
U.S.$162.3 billion, followed by France and Italy with U.S.$102.3 
billion and U.S.$66.2 billion, respectively. 
  Japan was the No. 1 Asian country and the world's sixth in 
exporting U.S.$49.6 billion worth of services. Singapore, Hong 
Kong and South Korea took 12th, 13th and 19th place with exports 
hitting U.S.$18.2 billion, U.S.$17 billion and U.S.$12.8 
billion, respectively. Taiwan ranked 20th in the category with 
exports amounting to U.S.$10.6 billion, OECD statistics show.

  [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- Taiwan may be forced to 
adopt the "Japanese formula" instead of the "Korean formula" in 
opening its rice market to foreign imports, an official 
representing Taiwan at tariff reduction negotiations in Geneva 
last week said upon his return to Taiwan on Tuesday [24 May]. 
  Chen Wu-hsiung, director of the Economics and Planning 
Department under the Council of Agriculture, said in order to 
join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, Taiwan 
will have to make some concessions in its trade regime, 
including liberalizing the rice market. 
  GATT regulations stipulate that Japan should allow rice 
imports of 4 percent of the nation's total rice consumption in 
its first year as a GATT member, and increase imports by 0.8 
percent annually to reach 8 percent by 2000. 
  South Korea, which GATT considers a developing country, must 
open 1 percent of its rice market to foreign imports in the 
first year with gradual increases ranging from 0.25 percent to 2 
percent annually in the following years and to open up 4 percent 
of its market to foreign rice within 10 years. 
  Most GATT contracting parties agreed in Geneva that Taiwan 
should not be allowed to follow the Korean formula because 
Taiwan is a developed country, Chen said. 
  Chen also said Taiwan will be hard hit by GATT regulations 
concerning fruit imports. Chen reckoned that Taiwan peaches, 
citrus fruits, mangoes, pineapples and pears will face increased 
competition from abroad. 
  Chen argued that it was unjustifiable that most GATT member 
countries are against Taiwan's desired tariffication plan 
because Taiwan is not a GATT member while at the same time 
demanding that Taiwan abide by the Uruguay Round trade accords 
to eliminate government subsidies to farmers.

  [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan is allowing imports 
of seafood from cholera-affected or potential cholera-affected 
areas as part of its efforts to join the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the department of health said 
Wednesday [25 May]. 
  For health safety, National Quarantine Service Director Wu 
Tsung-neng said all fishery produce from cholera-affected areas 
will undergo rigorous cholera checks and be kept for three to 
four days in customs. 
  A shipment of frozen salmon from Chile, the first delivery 
of 
seafood since the government lifted bans on such imports, has 
already hit the local market, Wu said. 
  Most countries impose no restrictions on fishery produce 
imports from cholera-affected or potential cholera areas, Wu 
said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- Aiming to further 
strengthen trade and economic ties with Central and South 
American countries, the government has decided to send a trade 
delegation to the region to look into investment opportunities, 
ranking officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said 
Wednesday [25 May]. 
  The announcement came following a Tuesday public hearing 
called by legislator Cheng Chien-jen, in which several Central 
and South American ambassadors called on the government to 
encourage more local investment in their countries as the best 
way to promote bilateral ties. 
  Ambassadors from El Salvador, Paraguay and the Dominican 
Republic said that although the performance of the Republic of 
China's [ROC] agricutural and fishery missions stationed in 
Central and South America have won high praise there, countries 
in the region need more foreign investment to boost and upgrade 
their economies. 
  They also advised the ROC to act to counter the diplomatic 
offensive launched by Mainland China to develop links with those 
Central and South American countries with which the ROC 
maintains formal ties. 
  Ministry officials said the government would continue to do 
its best to stimulate more private-sector investment in the 
region, particularly in those countries that are friendly to the 
ROC.

  [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan companies should 
consider forming strategic alliances with their counterparts in 
Sweden to tap north and east European markets, a senior trade 
official said Wednesday [25 May]. 
  "Sweden has advanced modern port and warehousing facilities 
as well as well-developed distribution systems," said James C.K. 
Lin, director of the Representative Office in Stockholm of the 
semi-official China External Trade Development Council (Cetra). 
  Lin, who returned to Taipei earlier this week for 
consultations, said Sweden is also a frontrunner in the 
aerospace, automobile and electronics industries. 
  "By forging partnerships with Swedish companies, Taiwan 
firms 
can obtain advanced technical know-how in the above-mentioned 
fields and gain access to north European markets," Lin said. 
  He said that although operational costs in Sweden are 
relatively high, the Scandinavian country offers many tax 
incentives for businesses. "Taiwan entrepreneurs can consider 
setting up distribution centers in Sweden to facilitate their 
entry to north and east European markets," he added. 
  Sweden has been Taiwan's most important trade partner in 
North Europe. Two-way trade between the two countries totaled 
US$880 million in 1993, down 12 percent from 1992. 
  In the first four months of this year, Taiwan-Swedish trade 
increased to US$330 million mainly because of a nearly 40 
percent growth in Taiwan's imports from Sweden. Taiwan's 
exports to that country, however, declined by about 15 percent 
during the four-month period. 
  Personal computers, bicycles, sporting goods and plastic 
products were Taiwan's main exports to Sweden, while cars, 
machinery and steel products formed the bulk of Taiwan imports 
from that country. 
  Cetra officials said Sweden offers preferential tariff rates 
for South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong because the Swedish 
Government considers them "developing countries or areas." 
Taiwan, however, is denied such treatment. This has been the 
greatest obstacle for Taiwan goods to enter the Swedish market, 
the officials noted.

  [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- The Navy intends to lease 
more Newport-class tank-landing ships from the United States, a 
Ministry of National Defense official said Wednesday [25 May]. 
  The official's remarks came after the United States House of 
Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill by voice vote 
authorizing the transfer of 17 US naval vessels to nine 
countries, including the tank-landing ships to Taiwan. 
  The US Navy declined to reveal the lease price for the three 
ships. 
  "They will be used to replace some aging LSTs (landing ship, 
tank) that have been in service since the Second World War by 
the ROC Marines," the official said. 
  Each of the Newport-class ships is capable of ferrying 700 
fully equipped soldiers and 500 tons of military equipment, and 
can sail at 20 knots per hour. 
  Meanwhile, a ministry report released Wednesday indicates 
the 
army is planning to procure some new-generation light tanks from 
the United States. The Army, according to the report, is 
keeping a close watch on evaluations being done by the US 
military on three types of newly developed light tanks, 
including the M8. 
  The Army needs not only medium-sized tanks but light tanks 
as 
well to defend Taiwan and the offshore islands, the report says. 
  It also defends the ministry's plan to buy an unspecified 
number of US-made M60-A3 tanks. The plan was severely attacked 
when the budget to finance arms acquisitions was recently 
submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval, with lawmakers 
claiming that the medium tanks would not be suitable for use on 
the rugged Taiwan terrain, and that they were old models 
scrapped by the US Army. 
  The report said the Army has no alternative but to buy the 
M60-A3s because Taiwan is unable to acquire more advanced tanks 
such as US M1 tanks, British Challengers and German Leopard 2s 
due to political factors. 
  Nevertheless, the report places the M60-A3 on the same level 
as the M1 in terms of combat capabilities. M60-A3s are equipped 
with solid-state computers, laser rangefinders with a maximum 
range of 5,000 meters, add-on-stabilization systems, and passive 
night-sight equipment, according to the report.

<F P=106> ["Special contribution" by Kan Cheng (1626 2110: "Why Has </F>
Chris Patten Been Back to London so Often")] 
  [Text] Hong Kong 22 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Hong Kong 
Governor Chris Patten is back in London for consultations again. 
This is his ninth trip to London in the two years since he took 
office in Hong Kong in July 1992; on average, once every three 
months or so. 
  There has been much talk about Chris Patten's frequent 
return 
to Britain recently in the British media. For example, Chris 
Patten's frequent return to Britain reflects "his obvious 
restlessness with his office as Hong Kong governor," he "still 
cannot forget about the British political arena," "his strong 
love for Westminster (the British Parliament) has not faded," 
"he no longer brags about having no intention to return to the 
British political arena," "he is picking up the topic that under 
whatever circumstances it is impossible for him to return to the 
British political arena," and "loves to talk about British 
politics and how to govern the country with British reporters." 
  As usual, Chris Patten has denied these rumors about 
himself. 
Some political analysts in London also believe that there is 
little chance of Chris Patten returning to the British political 
arena at the present stage, because "he really cannot find any 
way which is honorable and helpful to return to the British 
political arena." 
  Then, how should we account for his frequent trips to 
Britain? Is it really true that "he has nothing else to do in 
Hong Kong," and is thus returning to Britain "to enjoy a 
leisurely and carefree excursion," as some British media have 
put it? 
  That obviously does not conform to Chris Patten's 
inclination, which is unwilling to be lonely. 
  People notice that Chris Patten arrived in Hong Kong in July 
1992 to take office, but by mid-September, he had already taken 
his first trip back to London for consultations; on his return 
he delivered his government address on 6 October, in which he 
presented a constitutional reform package for Hong Kong, which 
consequentially sparked Sino-British polemics. 
  In its wake, every time Chris Patten returns to Britain, 
there is some new action upon his return to Hong Kong. For 
example, the gazettal of his constitutional reform package, the 
termination of the Sino-British talks on the arrangements for 
Hong Kong 1994/1995 elections, the tabling of his constitutional 
reform package to the Legislative Council...and so forth, and 
every action has caused shock and has added a great obstacle to 
a stable transition for Hong Kong. 
  Chris Patten's last trip to London was on 30 March this 
year. 
Shortly after his return to Hong Kong, the British Parliament's 
Select Committee on Foreign Affairs produced a report on 
Sino-British relations, which "proposes" that the British Hong 
Kong Government set up a "human rights commission" and an 
"organization to supervise human rights" which would continue 
after 1997, and the British Government and the UN Human Rights 
Commission would "jointly supervise the conditions and 
development of human rights in Hong Kong after 1997." 
  Indeed, there may be some truth in Chris Patten planning to 
sound out political conditions in Britain in an attempt to find 
a way to promote himself during his current trip to London as is 
being speculated, but the focus of his activities is likely to 
be on consulting officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth 
Office on the issue of "setting up a human rights commission in 
Hong Kong." 
  Noteworthy is the fact that a high-ranking Chinese official 
in charge of Hong Kong affairs indicated that, just like "a 
drinker's heart is not in the cup," the person who made the 
proposal to set up a human rights commission in Hong Kong aims 
to jeopardize the power framework established in the Basic Law, 
and the proposal "will consequently form `a weird embryo'." 
  Under such circumstances, people wish that Chris Patten 
would 
really confine himself to "enjoying an increasingly leisurely 
and carefree excursion with each passing day." However, 
experience tells us that a storm is likely to be conjured up in 
London, which will eventually attack Hong Kong again.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chen Ziying, 
deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, today met a Hong Kong Textile Council 
delegation. He said that China's policy of "one country, two 
systems" and "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" is based on 
full trust in Hong Kong compatriots. 
  Chen Ziying listened carefully to the guests' opinions and 
views on how to realize a steady transition and maintain 
economic prosperity in Hong Kong. 
  He added that the Chinese Government is trying by every 
possible means to preserve Hong Kong's position as an 
international economic and trade center, and hoped that all 
systems which have been proved effective and beneficial to Hong 
Kong's stability and prosperity will remain. 
  Chen Ziying reiterated his repeatedly expressed view, namely 
that he takes an optimistic attitude on maintaining Hong Kong's 
prolonged stability and development. 
  He pointed out: Hong Kong's present-day prosperity has been 
created by the Hong Kong people themselves. They have adequate 
ability and talent to exercise good management over Hong Kong's 
affairs after 1997. This was the basis for putting forward the 
policy of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people 
ruling Hong Kong." In addition, political stability as well as 
rapid and healthy [kuai su jian kang 1816 6643 0256 1660] 
economic development on the Chinese mainland also serve as new 
opportunities and fine conditions for Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity and the development of cooperative relations between 
the mainland and Hong Kong. 
  In conclusion, Chen Ziying indicated: The Chinese side has 
always cherished sincerity in cooperating with the British side; 
now the Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's constitutional system 
have broken down, but we hope that the British side will not 
adopt an uncooperative attitude in other aspects. This will not 
only serve Hong Kong's steady transition but is also for the 
sake of Sino-British long-term relations. 
  After the meeting, Chen Ziying held a banquet in honor of 
the 
30-member delegation. 
  The Hong Kong Textile Council delegation, headed by Fong 
Hang, arrived in Beijing yesterday. During their Beijing tour, 
they will visit the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, the Ministry of Domestic Trade, and the Chinese 
General Chamber of Textiles.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "China To Study Ways To Handle </F>
Naturalization of Foreign Residents in Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 May (TA KUNG PAO)--Shao Tianren, the 
leader of the Chinese side of the Preliminary Working Committee 
[PWC] Legal Group, said today that the naturalization of foreign 
residents of Hong Kong is a new issue which must be studied. At 
present, there is no Chinese public security organ in Hong Kong 
to handle such issues. 
  Before attending today's meeting of the PWC Legal Group, 
Shao 
Tianren was asked whether foreign residents of Hong Kong can 
apply for Chinese citizenship in order to meet requirements to 
be senior officials in the special administrative region [SAR] 
government. He said: Hong Kong is Chinese territory, but the 
territory has not been governed by China for the past 100 years 
or more. Therefore, applications for Chinese citizenship by 
foreign residents and people without nationality in Hong Kong 
has become a new issue. In addition to the fact that no public 
security organ can handle such matters there now, this is an 
issue China should consider how to deal with. He said that 
China may have to formulate certain policies and regulations for 
handling the nationality issue of such people after careful 
consideration and it was hard to comment for the time being. 
  He said: After the establishment of the SAR, Hong Kong will 
be a territory under China's jurisdiction, and this issue will 
become the same as in other parts of China. At present, 
foreigners in Beijing may submit applications to public security 
organs if they want to attain Chinese citizenship, but no 
Chinese public security organ now exists in Hong Kong.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 25 (XINHUA) -- China's public 
security organs today handed over to the Royal Hong Kong Police 
five pleasure crafts stolen from Hong Kong last year. 
  The five pleasure boats were handed over to Commissioner of 
Hong Kong Police Li Kwan-ha at a handling-over ceremony held at 
a pier in Shekou, in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone of 
southern China's Guangdong Province and then towed back to Hong 
Kong. 
  The recovered pleasure crafts have a total value of 12.2 
million HK dollars (1.56 million U.S. dollars), said Perter Yam, 
senior staff officer of the Organized Crime and Triad [word as 
received] Bureau (OCTB), at Sai Wan Ho Marine Police 
Headquarters, where the five boats towed to and anchored. 
  A total of nine pleasure boats were stolen from the Causeway 
Bay and Pochong Wan Typhoon Shelters in Hong Kong between 
January and October last year. Hong Kong Police passed on 
relevant information to its counter parts in China and some 
southeastern countries. 
  After a period of investigation, the public security bureau 
(PSB) in Guangdong Province recovered five of the nine stolen 
crafts and arrested two Hong Kong residents in connection with 
the case, Yam said. 
  Meanwhile, Hong Kong Police also arrested six Hong Kong 
residents based on information supplied by the Chinese PSB, he 
added. 
  As for the other four boats, Yam said, "The Chinese side 
tried its best to assist us in locating them, but there was no 
evidence that the boats are at the moment in China." He 
believes the other four boats are still somewhere in Southeast 
Asia. 
  Four of the five returned boats will be handed over to the 
insurance company and the fifth will go back to the original 
owner, Yam said. 
  In future, local police will tighten patrol on the sea and 
keep in closer contacts with China in cracking down on unlawful 
activities, he added.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (AFP)--China warned Washington on 
Thursday against attaching any conditions to the renewal of its 
preferential trading status with the United States, stressing 
that such a move would be "unwise." "The attaching of 
conditions will be unacceptable to the Chinese side," Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press briefing. 
  .U.S President Bill Clinton is widely expected to renew 
China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status before the weekend but 
with limited sanctions that could involve a ban on imports of 
weapons and ammunition made by the Chinese military. 
  "The unilateral exertion of pressure and adoption of 
restrictive measures with regard to trade... is not in 
conformity with international practises," Wu said, adding that 
any decision to impose limited sanctions "would be unwise." "We 
hope that the U.S. President will make a suitable decision," he 
said. 
  Wu refused to comment on what steps China would take should 
conditions be attached to MFN. 
  Clinton warned last year that renewal of China's MFN status, 
which brings the lowest available US tariffs on imports, 
depended on China showing "overall significant progress" in 
human rights. 
  He outlined seven areas needing improvement before the June 
3 
deadline for deciding on whether to maintain China's MFN status 
for another year, and asked US Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher to make a report. 
  Clinton officials said Christopher found China had met the 
minimum requirements in two areas: cooperation in ending the 
export of prison-made goods and allowing relatives of some 
dissidents to leave the country. 
  Reacting to reports that Clinton might also seek to set up a 
U.S. commission to monitor China's progress on human rights, Wu 
said dialogue "can be conducted with regard to the difference 
over the issue of human rights between China and the United 
States." However, he reiterated that China was opposed to any 
interference in its intenal affairs. 
  China has repeatedly protested the linking of MFN renewal 
with the human rights issue.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>
  [Excerpts] Beijing, May 26 (AFP)--Chinese dissidents 
Thursday publicly challenged the government by calling on it to 
overturn the official condemnation of the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement. 
  Seven dissidents involved in the Tiananmen Square massacre 
signed a petition submitted to the government by Wang Dan, the 
former student leader of China's 1989 pro-democracy 
demonstrations. [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on the petition at his weekly press briefing 
Thursday, foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said the "best 
judgement of an event... is history itself. For the past five 
years China has been enjoying political stability, economic 
development, and the living standards of its people have been 
improving constantly." 
  China and its people wanted this to continue in the interest 
of peace and stability in the region, he added. 
  The pro-democracy movement began April 15 and mobilised 
millions of Chinese before being crushed by the People's 
Liberation Army in central Beijing on June 4 1989. 
  According to an official version of events, 300 people died. 
Dissidents and independent observers said several thousands were 
killed in Beijing and the provinces. 
  Wang's petition said: "This movement was a popular, 
patriotic 
and democratic movement, based around students. We were 
reasonable and non-violent throughout." 
  As proof of just how worried the authorities are as the 
Tiananmen anniversary draws closer, Beijing police have been 
placed on permanent alert and have beefed up patrols, especially 
around the main campuses and the huge square itself, which was 
occupied by students in 1989. 
  University professors have received orders to be especially 
vigilant in the run-up to the annniversary. 
  In order to prevent public commemorations, the authorities 
have detained a number of people in the past weeks, especially 
members of the Chinese Association of Human Rights in Shanghai. 
  The most famous dissident, Wei Jingsheng, has been detained 
by police at a government residence in a Beijing suburb.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 26 (AFP)--China's prospects for 
rejoining General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would suffer a 
setback if the United States revokes its most-favored-nation 
(MFN) trading status, GATT director general Peter Sutherland 
said Thursday. 
  Sutherland, in Hong Kong two weeks after a visit to Beijing, 
said Washington's decision on MFN -- due by June 3 -- would 
"obviously have a relevance" to ongoing negotiations on China's 
GATT membership. "If China was to lose MFN status, it would 
have no direct bearing on the GATT negotiations," he told 
reporters. "But it would have an indirect bearing... because 
the MFN issue is one that is fundamental to GATT membership." 
  MFN enables foreign goods to enter a GATT member nation or 
territory at preferential rates. 
  The United States extends the status to nearly all its 
trading partners but President Bill Clinton has made renewal for 
China this year conditional on "overall significant progress" in 
human rights. 
  Sutherland earlier told business leaders there was a very 
slim chance that China would be able to join GATT this year in 
time to be a founding member of the new World Trade Organization 
on January 1. "I'm not saying its impossible... but it is a 
very demanding schedule," he said. 
  China was a founding member of GATT but withdrew from the 
arrangement in 1949 when the communists came to power.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- China announced here 
today a removal of licenses and quotas from another 195 kinds of 
imported goods. 
  China had abolished import licenses and quotas for 283 kinds 
of goods from January 1, 1994. 
  The announcement was made by Long Yongtu, assistant minister 
of foreign trade and economic cooperation, here this afternoon. 
  The move taken by the Chinese Government this time is 
designed to bring its import system closer to requirements of 
international practice and to set up a new import system with 
tariffs as its major means of regulation, Long said. 
  This marks an important part of China's efforts not only in 
reforming its import management system, but also in pushing 
forward the process of restoring its contracting status in the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the assistant minister 
told XINHUA. 
  Long made the remarks on the eve of his trip to Europe and 
the United States. He will head a delegation to Brussels and 
Washington on Friday [27 May] to discuss China's re-entry into 
GATT with the European Union (EU) and the United States. 
  The discussion with the EU is scheduled for May 30 and 31 in 
Brussels and the negotiations with the U.S. will run from June 
3 to June 8 in Washington. 
  The 195 kinds of imported goods from which licenses and 
quotas have been lifted this time cover 30 kinds of imports to 
be free of controls by the end of this year and 120 by the end 
of next year, as planned in the Sino-U.S. Memorandum of 
Understanding on Market Access. 
  China's stepped-up implementation of its promise in the 
agreement demonstrates China's sincerity and capability, Long 
said. 
  On the upcoming talks with the EU and the U.S., Long said 
the 
talks will be very substantial since a protocol package will be 
discussed during the period. 
  China has prepared itself in an earnest way for the 
discussions and will present a large number of documents on 
China's foreign trade regime, he said. 
  The assistant minister said the discussions, on a basis of 
full transparency, will focus on tariffs, tariff exemptions, 
foreign trading rights and other issues related to China's 
foreign trade system.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Pudong New Area in 
Shanghai has approved 364 overseas investment projects in the 
first four months this year, involving an agreed overseas 
capital of 1.28 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Officials from the new area administration said the amount 
of 
overseas investment is 121 percent higher than in the same 
period last year. 
  Panama, Israel, Western Samoa, Bolivia and Puerto Rico 
signed 
their first investment in the new area in the first quarter, 
said the officials. 
  By the end of April, 40 countries and regions worldwide had 
launched 1992 projects in the new area, with contracted overseas 
investment totalling 4.55 billion U.S. dollars, the officials 
said. 
  Among the world's top 100 multinationals, about a quarter 
now 
have investments in Pudong, according to the officials. 
  A report from the new area's trade bureau says that quite a 
lot of manufacturing businesses which came to Pudong when the 
new area was launched in 1991, are already making a good profit. 
  Thanks to the support of overseas capital, the new area has 
established a powerful high-tech industry, including high-grade 
chemicals, telecommunications, bio-pharmaceuticals, computer 
software, electronic products and new materials, said the 
officials.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 KYODO -- A group of Chinese 
dissidents led by former student activist Wang Dan, has called 
on the Chinese Government to reappraise the 1989 democracy 
movement and compensate the families of the victims. 
  In an open letter to China's National People's Congress 
[NPC] 
seen by KYODO NEWS SERVICE Thursday [26 May], seven dissidents 
said the movement cannot be forgotten because "we firmly believe 
that the movement had an inestimable effect on pushing history 
forward." 
  Wang was seen leaving Beijing on Tuesday with what is 
believed to have been an official or police escort, a friend of 
his said. 
  The letter openly calls on the National People's Congress, 
"the nation's most powerful organ," to act on three demands 
concerning the government's evaluation of the 1989 political 
protests. 
  The first demand called for reevaluation of the protests as 
a 
predominantly student-led, mass patriotic movement and asks that 
the movement's principles of "peace, reason and nonviolence" be 
recognized by the government. 
  "We believe that the government's determination of the event 
as `turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion' is unfair and 
should be reappraised at an early date," it said. 
  The second demand calls for the freeing of "all those 
arrested in connection with the `June 4' incident." 
  Finally the letter calls for "comfort and compensation to 
the 
bereaved families who lost family members because of `June 4"' 
and the promise to aid those released from jail who have 
problems reentering society. 
  Five years ago on June 3-4, 1989, the People's Liberation 
Army, under government orders, marched on the citizens of 
Beijing who had come out in support of student protests calling 
for greater democracy and an end to official corruption. 
  The government has yet to officially release the numbers of 
soldiers and citizens killed, or their names, during the period 
of military intervention. 
  Estimates range from the hundreds to tens of thousands as 
tanks, supported by ground troops, rolled over and shot at 
unarmed citizens as they moved towards Tiananmen Square in the 
city center. 
  The letter was signed by four former student leaders who 
were 
once on the list of "21 most-wanted students" and three others, 
including Li Hai, a signatory of the "peace charter" group of 
labor dissidents. 
  "Like the government, we hope for a stable social 
environment. To solve the `June 4' problem and untie the `knot' 
in the hearts of the people is not only beneficial to appeasing 
social contradictions...but will also encourage social 
stability," it said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (AFP)--The former leader of China's 
1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, Wang Dan, called on the 
government Thursday to overturn its official condemnation of the 
movement and release all protestors who remain behind bars. 
  "We believe that the government's ruling that the 1989 
movement amounted to chaos and counter-revolutionary rioting is 
unfair. This ruling must be revised as soon as possible," Wang 
said in a petition addressed to the standing committee of the 
National People's Congress (NPC). Six other dissidents involved 
in the Tiananmen Square movement also signed the document. 
  The petition also calls on the the release of "all those who 
are still detained because of their role in the 1989 movement" 
and "compensation for relatives of the June 4 dead, and help for 
former prisoners returning to society." 
  The pro-democracy movement began on April 15 and mobilised 
millions of Chinese before being crushed by the People's 
Liberation Army in central Beijing on June 4, 1989. According 
to an official version of events, 300 people died. Dissidents 
and observers who were present said several thousand were killed. 
  Wang's petition said: "This movement was a popular, 
patriotic 
and democratic movement, based around students. We were 
reasonable and non-violent throughout." 
  "We believe that the June 4 incident is like a `knot' in the 
history of the Chinese nation. Today we are at a key moment in 
reform and opening, and, like the government, wish to have 
stability," the text, released to the foreign press, said. 
  The document highlighted the need to promote social 
stability, build a democratic system and ensure social progress. 
  "We must undo this knot," it said. "This is why we sincerely 
wish that the government will take a wise step and take into 
account the interest of the nation and the future of the state." 
  "We have never forgotten this event, and we firmly believe 
that this movement has played a highly important role in the 
history of our country." 
  "On the occasion of the fifth anniversary, we exercise our 
political rights as citizens to issue these public appeals to 
the standing committee of the PNC, the supreme organ of state," 
it said. 
  The petition was signed by Wang Dan, Ma Shaofang, Zhai 
Weimin, Shao Jiang, Li Hai, Zheng Xuguang and Guo Haifeng. 
  According to a report released this month by the group Human 
Rights Watch/Asia, several hundred people are still in prison 
after being detained during the crackdown.

RIBAO reporter Jiang Zuosu (3068 0155 5685)] 
  [Text] Wuhan, 20 May (XINHUA) -- During his recent 
inspection tour in Hubei, Liu Huaqing, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and Vice Chairman of the Central 
Military Commission, stressed: We must accelerate the 
development of defense industries as well as the modernization 
of defense through the application of high technology. 
Meanwhile, defense industries should contribute more to the 
national economic development by serving economic construction, 
which is today's central task. 
  Liu Huaqing said: Revolutionaries of the older generation 
care very much about national defense. Not only have they 
written a lot of incisive works on defense, but have also 
personally directed and organized many major research projects. 
Defense industries have made new headway in recent years as a 
result of the leadership of the party central committee, the 
State Council, and the Central Military Commission. From now on 
we must work even harder and continue to press forward to live 
up to the expectations of the revolutionaries of the older 
generation. 
  Liu Huaqing noted: Having been tempered and nurtured for 
decades, Chinese scientists, technicians, and administrators 
working for defense industries have become quite proficient. 
Considering hard work and selfless dedication an honor, they 
have contributed significantly to China's defense through giving 
full scope to their talents and capabilities. Because we have 
such invaluable people, the modernization of China's national 
defense is highly promising. 
  Liu Huaqing said: Defense industries must closely follow the 
world's rapid development of high technology. The development 
of our own advanced technology should be organically combined 
with purchases of advanced technology from abroad, and we must 
make constant efforts to improve these technologies so that they 
can serve our strategic policy, namely "active defense." Under 
the premise of ensuring our technology's systematicness [xi tong 
xing 4762 4827 1840], integrity, and reliability, we must from 
now on set higher standards for our development and make 
constant efforts to attain new goals. Meanwhile, we must set 
strict requirements for management, underscore quality, and work 
meticulously. By no means should we do our work formalistically. 
  Liu Huaqing stressed: China now gives top priority [shou wei 
7445 0143] to economic construction, which is the center of 
everything. Defense industries should also obey and serve the 
needs of economic construction, and give local industries and 
economies the support they need for development. 
  During his inspection tour in Hubei, Liu Huaqing also 
visited 
the Wuchang Shipyard to understand its production and to see the 
cadres and workers there. He also inspected the Wuhan Changfei 
Optical Fiber Cable Company and the Tonghu High-Technology 
Development Zone. In Yichang, he also inspected the Three Gorges 
Project and the Gezhouba Power Plant, and heard briefings of the 
dam's construction and the plant's management. 
  Accompanying Liu Huaqing during the inspection were Hubei 
Governor Jia Zhijie and leaders of relevant departments.

Zhenying (0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 
1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
called a teleconference at Zhongnanhai this afternoon to make 
arrangements for the work of "preventing fraud, theft, and 
robbery; and safeguarding funds security in banks" ["three 
preventions and one safeguard"]. Zhu Rongji, vice premier of 
the State Council and governor of the People's Bank of China 
[PBOC], attended and addressed the meeting. 
  It has been learned that some criminals have made banks 
their 
targets for wantonly carrying out all kinds of financial crimes 
since reform and opening up to the outside world, particularly 
during recent years when China accelerated the development of a 
socialist market economy. Under the leadership of the party 
Central Committee and the State Council and the strong support 
of the public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments, 
banks and finance companies at various levels in the banking 
system have persistently cracked down on economic crimes; 
carried out first the activities of "education, cleanup, and 
rectification" and then the work of "two preventions and one 
safeguard" -- which was mainly for "preventing fraud and theft, 
and safeguarding the security of funds in banks" -- and scoring 
some successes since the latter half of 1991. 
  Zhu Rongji said: At present, criminal activities, such as 
financial fraud, have become a noticeable problem for the 
banking system. Cadres, staff, and workers of banking 
departments at all levels must conscientiously enhance their 
sense of responsibility for protecting state property and 
safeguarding state interests; strictly implement the state's 
banking laws, regulations, and rules; and try hard to improve 
their political and professional caliber, to make due efforts to 
guarantee a normal banking order for the state. 
  In his speech, Zhu Rongji also stated his views on the 
current macroeconomic situation and the tasks facing the 
country's banking system. 
  Luo Gan, state councillor and secretary general of the State 
Council, presided over the teleconference. PBOC Vice Governor 
Zhou Zhengqing and Public Security Vice Minister Mou Xinsheng 
addressed the meeting, expressing specific views on resolutely 
preventing and cracking down on the crimes of financial fraud, 
theft, and robbery, and safeguarding funds security in banks. 
  Zhou Zhengqing pointed out: All in all, China's current 
economic and banking situation is good, with the banking 
situation continuing its smooth and healthy development, the 
banking order improving further, and the banking reform 
advancing steadily. In the course of progress, however, there 
remain some problems that deserve our attention. Among them, 
the crimes of financial fraud, theft, and robbery are a 
noticeable problem most seriously disturbing, damaging, and 
affecting current financial undertakings, financial reform, and 
opening up of the financial sector to the outside world. They 
not only brought to the state tremendous economic risks and 
losses and endangered the personal safety of bank staff and 
workers, but also disturbed normal social and banking order, 
seriously damaged financial institutions' reputation, and posed 
a serious threat to banking undertakings and even economic 
development. They will seriously compromise the smooth progress 
of our reform, opening up to the outside world, and economic 
construction, should we fail to take resolute, effective 
measures to stop and prevent their occurrence. Leading comrades 
at all levels in the banking system must have a clear 
understanding of this. All banks and finance companies should 
immediately mobilize all their personnel to act swiftly and 
struggle resolutely against the various financial crimes. 
  Zhou Zhengqing stressed: To resolutely stop and prevent 
financial fraud, theft, and robbery, we need to take the 
following measures: 1) All banks and finance companies at all 
levels in the banking system must attach great importance to the 
work of "preventing fraud, theft, and robbery; and safeguarding 
funds security in banks." It is particularly important for 
principal leading comrades of banks and finance companies at all 
levels to place the work high on the agenda and carry it out as 
an important matter. 2) To resolutely expose and crack down on 
fraud under the cover of "foreign capital introduction," the 
utilization of foreign capital must be examined and approved in 
strict accordance with relevant state provisions and procedures. 
3) It is essential to strictly observe banking laws and 
regulations and resolutely implement various rules and 
regulations. Banks and other financial institutions at all 
levels should do business in strict accordance with the 
stipulated terms of reference and within the approved scope of 
operation. 4) We should strengthen case investigation and 
handling to enforce banking discipline. 5) Efforts should be 
made to strengthen education and training for the vast 
contingent of cadres, staff, and workers on the "three 
preventions and one safeguard." 
  Zhou Zhengqing said: After this teleconference, all units 
should promptly relay to all cadres, staff, and workers the 
conference guidelines and speeches of the leading comrades of 
the party Central Committee and the State Council, earnestly 
organize discussions, scrutinize loopholes and problems, and 
draw up realistic and feasible preventive measures. The head 
offices of banks and finance companies should arrange for the 
work of "three preventions and one safeguard" throughout their 
entire organizations; forward clear and specific demands; and 
conscientiously strengthen supervision, inspection, and guidance 
to prevent and stop financial fraud, theft, and robbery. 
  Mou Xinsheng demanded that public security organs at all 
levels earnestly implement this conference's guidelines and -- 
under the leadership of local party committees and governments 
-- support and work closely with banking institutions in 
vigorously preventing and cracking down on fraud, theft, and 
robbery in banks and in safeguarding fund security in banks. 
Once they receive a report on bank theft or robbery, as well as 
forgery, theft, or illegal sale of value-added tax receipts, the 
public security organs should assemble competent officers and 
men to take swift action and decisive measures to contain and 
intercept the criminals and to try every possible means to take 
control of the illicit money to avoid or minimize losses. They 
should resolutely and completely destroy the lairs for forging 
or illegally selling value-added tax receipts to effectively 
safeguard the smooth implementation of tax reforms. 
  Also attending the meeting were responsible people from 
relevant departments under the State Council, financial 
institutions, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme 
People's Procuratorate; and other departments concerned. 
  Comrades in charge of banking work from people's governments 
at and above the county level as well as responsible comrades of 
financial and public security departments at various levels took 
part in the teleconference at more than 2,000 different 
locations.

(2621 3503): "Vice Premier Li Lanqing Inspects Suzhou Industrial 
Park; He Noted That Suzhou Industrial Park's Development and 
Construction Was a Major Task Not Only for Suzhou But Also for 
Jiangsu and the Entire Nation"] 
  [Text] Accompanied by Chen Huanyou, secretary of the 
Jiangsu Provincial party committee and governor; and Wang 
Rongbing, vice governor; Li Lanqing, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State 
Council, on 13 May braved the rain and muddy roads to inspect 
the Suzhou Industrial Park, a project which had just been 
officially launched, and which was under intensive construction. 
He called for coordinating actions, strengthening unity, and 
carrying out all fields of work around the project so as to 
foster Suzhou-style efficiency. 
  Vice Premier Li Lanqing and his entourage arrived at the 
lakeside of Lake Jinji in eastern Suzhou, where the Preparatory 
Committee for the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative 
Committee conducts its business. He heard a briefing on the 
park's planning and design. He then braved the rain and arrived 
by car at the construction site of a small demonstration zone 
developed during the first stage of the industrial park, as well 
as the construction site of a road for exclusive use by the 
Jiangsu and Shanghai airports, where he inspected progress in 
construction work. 
  In the evening, leading comrades from Jiangsu Province and 
Suzhou city briefed Vice Premier Li Lanqing on progress made by 
the province and city over the past few months in expeditiously 
launching the Suzhou Industrial Park. After hearing the 
briefings, Vice Premier Li delivered an important speech. 
  First, Vice Premier Li Lanqing expressed his satisfaction 
with the speed and efficiency with which the Suzhou Industrial 
Park had been launched officially in just over two months after 
the Chinese and Singaporean Governments officially signed the 
relevant agreement. He said: This project is one of 
cooperation between the Chinese and Singaporean Governments. 
This model of cooperation has never been adopted before; it is 
South-South cooperation. The project's success will prove to 
the world that South-South cooperation is practical and 
feasible. The project represents overall interests. Its 
success will also advance reform and opening up in Suzhou, as 
well as in Jiangsu and the rest of the country. The Suzhou 
Industrial Park's development and construction is a major task 
not only for Suzhou but also for Jiangsu and the entire country. 
For this reason, central leading comrades, such as General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji, are all very concerned about the project. We should 
unify our thinking, coordinate our actions, support each other, 
strengthen unity, and carry out all fields of work around this 
project; we should never compromise our overall interests. Vice 
Premier Li emphatically pointed out: A pressing task of the 
moment is to do a good job of building the small demonstration 
zone. Because the Suzhou Industrial Park's development and 
construction is a very complicated task, we must carry out 
relevant work carefully and efficiently. 
  Vice Premier Li Lanqing said: In developing and building the 
Suzhou Industrial Park, we should stress both material and 
spiritual civilization. We should stress spiritual civilization 
in the initial stage of construction. We should uphold 
socialist spiritual civilization and should never allow 
unhealthy things in. Despite our implementation of a socialist 
market economy, we should emphasize spiritual things, such as 
the spirit of dedication and the practice of taking pleasure in 
helping others. We should not take the market economy to mean 
that we can benefit ourselves at the expense of other people and 
concern ourselves exclusively with the pursuit of profit. 
  Vice Premier Li also discussed the issue of learning from 
Singapore's experience in economic development and public 
administration. He urged the authority in charge of the Suzhou 
Industrial Park to explore some experiences that can be promoted 
nationwide while taking account of China's realities in 
practice. He said: The Suzhou Industrial Park administrative 
agency should perform its functions efficiently and in 
accordance with laws and regulations, improve the transparency 
of its work methods, and foster Suzhou-style efficiency. 
  In closing, Li Lanqing asked the authority in charge of the 
Suzhou Industrial Park to make every effort to open up more 
avenues for training skilled personnel. To provide skilled 
personnel of various levels for the park's construction, it may 
recruit personnel to undergo training in Singapore, ask 
Singapore to send people to China to provide training, or 
entrust China's institutions of higher learning and vocational 
schools to train people with Singapore's assistance. He said 
hopefully: To restructure its industry and transform its old 
enterprises along with the park's construction, Suzhou should 
encourage some technologically advanced enterprises in other 
parts of China to set up factories in the park while, at the 
same, attracting foreign investment into the park. 
  Accompanying Vice Premier Li Lanqing on his inspection tour 
of the Suzhou Industrial Park were responsible people from 
relevant state departments, including Xi Dehua, deputy secretary 
general of the State Council; Gan Ziyu, vice chairman of the 
State Planning Commission; and Zhao Guanghua, deputy director of 
the State Council's Special Economic Zone Office.

  [Text] Fuzhou, 1 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Fujian 
Literature and Art Radio officially started broadcasting this 
morning. At this point, Fujian People's Broadcasting Station, 
which has a 45-year history, has already developed into four 
specialized stations; namely, Southeast Radio Company, Economic 
Radio, People's Radio, and the Literature and Art Radio, thus 
satisfying as much as possible the many diversified needs of the 
masses. 
  The reform of Fujian broadcasting began step by step in 
1993. 
The Southeast Radio Company was the first one to begin 
broadcasting. Then came Fujian Economic Radio and the Fujian 
People's Broadcasting Station's Comprehensive News Radio. At 
present, these specialized radio stations are flourishing and 
well received by the broad masses of people, to the extent that 
radio broadcasting, which had been seriously challenged by 
television programming, shows great vitality again. 
  Fujian Literature and Art Radio, established upon approval 
by 
the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, is a comprehensive 
radio station that mainly broadcasts music, but will also 
broadcast literature and drama. After beginning broadcasting, 
it will diligently build a great hall of literature and art to 
provide the public with a new dimension of entertainment, 
appreciation, enlightenment, and development.

  [Text] A rural economic survey team recently conducted 
investigations and studies in 3,360 peasant households in 32 
counties, cities, prefectures, and special zones. The results 
of the investigations show that in 1993, the surplus rural labor 
force in our province markedly quickened its pace in flowing 
into the secondary and tertiary industries. In 1993, 1.473 
million persons transferred to the secondary and tertiary 
industries, an increase of 221 percent over 1992. 
  The main features of the surplus labor force flow were: 
  The percentage of the female labor force which transferred 
was greater than that of the male labor force. Over the whole 
year, more than 860,000 males and 940,000 females transferred, 
up 196 percent and 232 percent respectively over 1992. In the 
past, labor transferring to other areas consisted mainly of 
unmarried women. Now young married women also vie with one 
another to take part in the labor force exodus. Of the more 
than 2,600 working women from Yantong Town of Jinsha County, 
nearly 800 were married. As for the surplus peasant work force, 
544,000 persons worked in other provinces, an increase of more 
than 400 percent over 1992. 
  In the past, surplus labor transferring to sectors other 
than 
agriculture mainly flowed into secondary industry. But last 
year more than 670,000 persons transferred to tertiary industry, 
214 percent more than in 1992. The fact that agricultural labor 
is flowing into nonagricultural sectors has not only increased 
peasants' incomes, but also expanded the collective economy. 
According to the results of investigations conducted in 17 
townships and towns, including Yinya Township of Guiyang City 
and Nanbai Town of Zunyi County, of a work force totaling 
336,300, 62,800 had transferred to secondary and tertiary 
industries, accounting for 18.76 percent of the total labor 
force. Production output value created by the above-mentioned 
62,800 persons accounted for 76 percent of the total rural 
social production output value, more than 13 times the 
production output value of agriculture. 
  According to investigations, in 1993 47,000 persons in 
Zhengan County went to work in other provinces, and their total 
incomes reached 33 million yuan. After deducting their own 
expenses, they remitted more than 20 million yuan to their home 
county [words indistinct]. The total income of Jinsha County 
peasants working in other provinces reached more than 100 
million yuan, accounting for about one-third of the total net 
income of the peasants of the whole county. 
  Generally speaking, it was beneficial to transfer our 
province's labor force to other areas last year. However, 
problems also existed. The main problem was that the cultural 
quality of our exported labor was comparatively low, and that 
the percentage of illiterate or semi-illiterate persons was 
comparatively great. Only a small percentage of our exported 
labor had received various kinds of professional training. In 
addition, 22.24 percent of our exported labor force was sent 
back in the same year.

<F P=106> [Text of President Li Teng-hui's national affairs address to </F>
the Fourth Extraordinary Session of the Second National Assembly 
on 19 May: "Spare No Effort To Meet the Challenge in the Face of 
a Changing International Situation"] 
  [Text] Chairman of the National Assembly, and lady and 
gentlemen delegates: 
  Today, I feel greatly honored to be able to deliver a report 
on the state of the country to the Fourth Extraordinary Session 
of the Second National Assembly in the capacity of president of 
the Republic of China [ROC]. 
  Over the past four decades, the ROC in Taiwan, supported by 
the determination and solidarity of our compatriots who fought 
arduously, overcame numerous difficulties, and created a 
multiparty democratic political system unprecedented in the 
history of the Chinese nation, setting an example for the 
world's developing countries in economic development and 
political democracy. The people of the whole country are proud 
of this achievement. 
  However, the world keeps on revolving and the international 
situation keeps on changing. Not only should we not feel 
complacent with ourselves, but we should step forward bravely to 
meet the challenges of the future. Today, with the end of the 
Cold War and the international order waiting to be rebuilt, the 
ROC is still confronted with the Chinese Communist regime, which 
is pursuing a dictatorial rule and accelerating its military 
strength and has never abandoned its ambition to invade Taiwan 
with force. While doing our best to cope with fast-changing 
international relations, we must break the Chinese Communists' 
diplomatic blockade to win a place in the international 
community. Especially after we have become economically 
prosperous and created a democratic political system, we must 
work harder to improve the quality of life and attach importance 
to human dignity. We must seek consensus with regard to 
traditions and modernization and concepts and behavior so we can 
join hands in creating peace and harmony. 
  Our past efforts have laid a sound foundation for future 
development. Henceforth, with the concerted efforts of the 
people of the whole country, we will certainly be able to 
overcome difficulties and build a modern, prosperous, and urbane 
society in which there is justice and mutual respect. 
<H5>  The Foundation of the Rule of Law Is Improving </H5>
  Since I was elected the eighth president of the ROC by the 
National Assembly, I have always been aware of the heavy 
responsibility on my shoulders, and I hope the foundation for 
the rule of law needed for our country's long-term development 
will be built at an early date. 
  To deal with the matter of constitutional reform before the 
country's reunification, four years ago we invited noted figures 
at home and abroad to a conference to discuss state affairs. We 
have made a big stride forward in constitutional reform based on 
the measures adopted at the conference. According to our reform 
procedures, we terminated the period of mobilization for the 
suppression of the communist rebellion; opened up a new era of 
peaceful competition between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait; 
retired the deputies to the First National Assembly; and elected 
new deputies to the Second National Assembly. We have also 
built a legal basis for local self-government. Clear standards 
were established for the development of the economy, science and 
technology, environmental protection, agriculture, and fishing 
industry; for the advancement of health insurance for the whole 
people; and for the protection of the rights and interests of 
women, handicapped people, aborigines, compatriots in the Kinmen 
and Matsu region, and Overseas Chinese. As for the method of 
electing the president and vice president and other related 
questions, they concern the perfection of the system of 
constitutional government and their impact will be far-reaching. 
With regard to these issues, I trust the deputies will heed the 
people's will, pool your wisdom, and make the most appropriate 
decision in accordance with the basic framework of the 
five-power Constitution after analyzing the present state of the 
development of constitutional government in our country and the 
needs for national reunification in the future. 
  In implementing democracy, the establishment of party 
politics is a major task that should be neglected. The more 
plural and open the society is, the more it will rely on 
political parties to play a role in integrating values and 
forming a consensus. Currently, our party politics have not 
operated in a mature way; however, as long as we are 
open-minded, far-sighted, have the daring to institute the 
system, and tolerate and respect each other, we will make our 
ideal come true in a short time. 
  In implementing constitutional reform, the political 
structure and development objectives, following the end of the 
mobilization for the suppression of communist rebellion period, 
will be readjusted. How to implement the revised Constitution 
in terms of laws and policies, is a major task that should be 
carried out earnestly by our government. Today, since our 
democratic society is taking shape, we are confident and 
determined that the ROC will become a first-class country in the 
world and our people, first-class people in the world. 
<H5>  Economic Construction That Increases Our Actual Strength </H5>
  Over the past four decades, the ROC has concentrated efforts 
on economic development and created an "economic miracle" that 
attracts worldwide attention. The solid national strength we 
have built has not only improved the standard of living but has 
also become a powerful backing force for expanding international 
relations. Under a situation of global economic recession, our 
economic growth rate was 5.9 percent in 1993 -- evidence of a 
brisk economy. However, in the face of the challenges of 
domestic economic transition and readjustment of an 
international economic order, we should accelerate structural 
readjustment and increase our economic strength, so as to score 
even greater economic achievements. 
  Therefore, in 1993 our government proposed an "Economic 
Revitalization Package" and 12 projects in an attempt to 
strengthen basic construction of our society, stimulate 
investment from the private sector, accelerate upgrading 
industries, and make greater contributions to the world economy. 
  To implement the policy on economic revitalization, our 
government has worked out some concrete supporting measures. In 
instituting systems, we should accelerate liberalizing and 
internationalizing our economy and privatizing the 
government-run enterprises, as well as institute a legal and 
institutional framework in line with international practices. 
In improving manpower quality, we should encourage even more 
scientists and technicians abroad to start an undertaking in our 
country, assist enterprises at home to engage in research and 
development on high technology products, and improve the 
technological level. In land utilization, we are pushing 
forward policies on releasing farmland and improving land 
utilization, so as to return interests from land development to 
the whole nation and lighten the financial burden of public 
construction. 
  International trade is the main force of our economy. 
Changes in the international economic climate will have an 
impact on domestic economic development. The international 
economic system has undergone drastic changes in recent years. 
The formation of North American and European economic blocs in 
1993, operation of the "Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation" forum 
in an active way, and agreements reached at the Uruguay Round 
show that in the future, a new international economic order will 
be established under the two major axes of regional economic 
integration and trade liberalization. In view of this 
situation, our government has made positive and responsive 
preparations. 
  First of all, we will make positive efforts 
to join international economic organizations to secure 
international dialogue channels. We are now prepared to join 
GATT. Although this will have some impacts on the domestic 
markets, the government will take prudent measures to safeguard 
the rights and interests of farmers and domestic industries. 
Second, in addition to continuing to strengthen bilateral trade 
relations with Japan, the United States, and Europe, we will 
actively promote economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific 
region, especially our economic cooperation with Southeast Asian 
nations. By doing so, we will be able to make use of Southeast 
Asia's rich resources and help countries in this region develop 
their economies, thus establishing cooperative and mutually 
beneficial relations with them. Moreover, Taiwan's good 
geographical position is also a favorable factor that we can 
make good use of. We will woo international enterprises to 
invest in Taiwan in a planned manner and use Taiwan as a base 
for entering the Asia-Pacific market, to develop Taiwan into the 
business center of the Asia-Pacific region, and to expand the 
space for Taiwan's long-range development. 
<H5>  A Newly-Born and Diversified Culture </H5>
  Culture is a heritage of history, crystallization of wisdom, 
and distillation of social activities. A glance at world 
history tells us that only societies with a highly developed 
economy and in which people can freely express their will can 
develop a spectacular culture. Therefore, a country's cultural 
level is an important indicator of its national strengthens. 
Today, the ROC has created an affluent and democratic society 
that had never been seen in Chinese history. We will work even 
harder to add new vitality to the Chinese culture. 
  The Chinese nation has a long history and rich cultural 
heritage. This of course is an inexhaustible resource. But, 
culture is not historical ruins that never change -- it should 
be a life force that continues to grow in daily life and 
spiritually. Therefore, we must not let the substance of 
culture be confined within traditional cultural relics and 
classic inheritance. Instead, we should inject new vitality 
into our traditional culture to create new life. 
  To bring about new cultural development, the government, in 
addition to continuing to protect and promote our fine 
traditional culture, will encourage the people to assimilate all 
kinds of cultures and to blend them with our traditional culture 
so that our traditional culture will assume a brand new look. 
  Because Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu are at the edge of 
the Asian continent, they have been a region where Oriental and 
Western cultures meet and where continental and oceanic 
characteristics merge -- this region is the most ideal place for 
the development of a diversified culture. Therefore, we can now 
see that cultural and artistic activities have developed 
vibrantly in this region and can feel the vigor born out of 
various cultures. The cultural potential accumulated by all our 
social strata is now ready to be released and the "new Chinese 
culture" will blossom soon. Following our economic and 
political accomplishments, culture will be another sphere in 
which we score great achievements. 
  A Streamlined, Solid, and Strong National Defense 
Force 
  National security is the precondition for a nation's 
survival 
and a society's development, and a strong national defense force 
is the cornerstone of national security. Although currently the 
international situation tends to be relaxed, regional conflicts 
have erupted around the world from time to time. In Asia, North 
Korea is developing nuclear weapons and there are disputes over 
territorial sovereignty and resources in the South China Sea, 
casting clouds of instability over countries in this region. 
And, in recent years, the Chinese Communists have continued to 
increase their defense budget, expand their naval and air force 
armament, purchase sophisticated weapons, and redeploy their 
troops in the mainland's southeast coastal areas. All this has 
increased the potential threat to us. For this reason, 
maintaining a strong national defense force is still an 
important goal of our policy. 
  Our current defense policy is to build a high-quality 
defense 
force of fewer men and high combat capability; and to devise a 
defense strategy according to the priority order of gaining air 
superiority and command of the sea and developing an 
anti-landing force, according to the principle of developing the 
three armed services in a balanced way, and starting from 
reducing the size of the troops, increasing the troops' 
firepower, and improving the troops' mobility. In recent years, 
we have readjusted the military's organizational structure, 
downsized the troops, improved the military education system, 
refined the noncommissioned officer system, updated our weapons 
and armament, improved the troops' training, revised and 
restructured the logistics system, and improved the livelihood 
of military officers and men to build a strong and dependable 
defense force. 
  The idea of building up the Armed Forces at the current 
stage 
is, based on future combat requirements and the available 
national defense manpower and financial resources, to plan for 
the defense force for the next decade, to downsize the troops, 
to maintain an ever-ready force, and to maintain a large number 
of reserve personnel. In addition to gradually reducing the 
troops to 400,000 men, we are studying changing the mobilization 
system to maintain a large number of reserve personnel during 
peace time and to enable them to swiftly support combat when war 
breaks out. 
  Without national defense, there is no national security, 
hence, no construction and prosperity. Modern national defense 
is all-people defense. I hope all the people, based on our 
common sense of patriotism, will regard national defense as an 
important link in the nation's development and will unite to 
support our national defense efforts to build a modern national 
defense system to ensure the nation's security. 
<H5>  Cultivate a Mutual-Trust Cross-Strait Relationship </H5>
  The ROC Government's mainland policy is to achieve national 
unification following the procedures laid down in the Guidelines 
for National Unification and on the basis of democracy, freedom, 
and equal distribution of wealth. Over the last few years, the 
government has gradually lifted control over people-to-people 
communications between the two sides of the Strait, thus 
gradually increasing cross-Strait relative visiting and exchange 
in the economic, trade, cultural, academic, and sports fields. 
This development is very important to enhancing mutual 
understanding between the two sides. 
  The two sides across the Strait have been split and 
governed separately for more than four decades. As a result of 
different ideologies, there is a giant gap between the two sides 
in terms of politics, economics, and social systems. To narrow 
the gap and seek a consensus, the two sides should accumulate 
experience and build mutual trust through various talks and 
routine consultations. The Koo-Wang meeting held in Singapore in 
April 1993 has set up channels for institutionalized contacts 
and talks and has worked out some topics for future discussions. 
This concrete result is a good start in institutionalizing and 
regularizing cross-Strait interaction between the 
nongovernmental organizations. 
  In the years ahead, the ROC will continue to adhere to the 
principle of rationality, peace, equality, and reciprocity to 
develop cross-Strait relations. However, we would also like to 
reiterate that the Chinese Communist authority, refusing to face 
the reality that the two sides are split and governed 
separately, is the major reason the two sides have not been able 
to build a mutual trust. We want to solemnly call on the 
Chinese Communist authority to face the new cross-Strait 
situation of peaceful competition with a new understanding, 
knowledge, and policies and to make contributions to opening a 
new chapter in Chinese history. 
<H5>  Foreign Relations Promoted in a Practical Way </H5>
  After the ending of the Cold War, the international 
situation 
has shifted from military standoff to economic cooperation. In 
view of the international situation, the focus of the ROC's 
diplomatic work is to fully utilize its economic power and show 
its sincerity and competence to share and fulfill international 
responsibilities, so as to call international attention to the 
fact that the ROC on Taiwan exists and to call respect for ROC's 
aspiration and rights to participate in international affairs. 
  As far as concrete policies are concerned, our government 
has 
earnestly developed substantial relations with countries around 
the world and strived to join in international organizations to 
promote international cooperation and to seek peaceful 
settlement for international issues through multilateral 
consultations, according to the principle of making extensive 
friendly contacts and making contributions to the international 
community, 
  In recent years, we have scored remarkable results in 
strengthening relations and expanding cooperation and exchanges 
with countries with or without diplomatic ties with our country. 
Many countries have broken the past taboo to develop a higher 
level of contacts with our country. Over the past year, 
international leaders such as former British prime minister, 
Madame Thatcher; former U.S. President, Mr. Bush; and former 
USSR president, Mr. Gorbachev came to visit our country. These 
visits have further widened our international horizon and have 
called international attention to our country. 
  In February this year, I visited the Philippines, 
Indonesia, and Thailand. I met with the heads of state of the 
three countries and exchanged views with them. This is an 
important milestone in the cooperative relations between our 
country and Southeast Asian countries and is a pioneering move 
to expand all-directional international relations for our 
country. 
  In developing multilateral relations, we will continue to 
push our established policy of joining the United Nations. In 
addition, we will not give up any opportunity to participate in 
international organizations or international meetings, so as to 
expand our area of activity in the international arena and to 
establish an international status for our country. 
  Even though the Chinese Communists have vainly attempted to 
undermine our international relations and downgraded our 
international status, our determination to expand pragmatic 
diplomacy will never change. Because the ROC is a peace-loving 
country, we are earnestly willing to do our best to join the 
countries and peoples of the world in working for peace, 
cooperation, and prosperity of the human race. 
<H5>  With Consensus, Success Can Be Expected </H5>
  Ladies and gentlemen, since I was elected president, I have 
always been aware of my heavy responsibility. I have constantly 
encouraged myself, and I hope that with your support and the 
concerted efforts of the people of the whole country, the goal 
of enhancing the people's welfare and establishing a system 
under which the country is well-governed and enjoys lasting 
stability will be realized. 
  The road we have traveled over the past four decades proves 
that we have been making efforts in the right direction. We 
have not worked in vain. Today, the economic prosperity, the 
practice of democratic politics, and social stability in the 
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu regions show we are already 
standing on another new historical starting point. As we look 
into the future, we see the world situation is changing and 
treacherous. The situation in Mainland China is unpredictable, 
and we are being tested by numerous obstacles and difficulties. 
However, our successful "Taiwan experience" tells us that so 
long as the people of the country form a consensus on "the 
community of life" and enhance the plentiful vitality of 
society, they will be able to stand firm like a rock and create 
another new situation. 
  The 21st century is approaching. To meet the challenges of 
the new era, we must widen our horizon. The ROC can neither 
alienate itself from the mainland nor isolate itself from the 
world. Henceforth, we will, of course, continue our reform and 
respect the people's will. We will not only build the Taiwan, 
Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu regions into a modern society that 
conforms to world trends and advanced standards, but we will 
also strive to lay a solid foundation for a free, democratic, 
prosperous, and unified New China. 
  In conclusion, let us wish the ROC and its people prosperity 
and peace! At the same time, I wish you all good health and 
happiness! Thank you.

  [Text] The State Economic and Trade Commission recently 
decided to launch a campaign among enterprises across the 
country to change operating mechanisms, improve management, tap 
internal potential, and raise economic efficiency while 
deepening the regulations on changing enterprises' operating 
mechanisms. The campaign, which will be initiated this year, is 
aimed at providing guidance to enterprises on tapping their 
potential, improving quality in an all-round way, better 
adjusting themselves to the market, and competing in the market. 
  A State Economic and Trade Commission spokesman recently 
briefed reporters on the campaign's purpose and demands. He 
said: The purpose of launching the campaign is to proceed 
steadily in establishing a modern enterprise system in 
accordance with the need to develop a socialist market economy 
so as to lay the microeconomic groundwork for the market 
economy. Through the campaign, we will strive to raise or 
improve, with appreciable results, enterprises' technical and 
economic indexes for product development, quality, energy and 
raw materials consumption, capital turnover, and safety over the 
next two to three years. We will raise the leading economic and 
technical indexes of more enterprises, bring them up to or close 
to advanced international levels. Deficit-ridden enterprises 
will reduce their losses or turn losses into profits, and the 
general level of enterprise management will reach a new high. 
We will bring about remarkable improvements in managing basic 
affairs, financial matters, on-site operations, general affairs, 
and operating and marketing matters. Enterprises, which are 
basically well-managed and outfitted with advanced technology 
and equipment, should move toward advanced international levels 
in operation-related management. 
  The spokesman said: To assess the campaign's results, we 
will generally adopt the single-index listing format. Each 
year, all localities and departments will list, index by index, 
the results of given industries as measured against specified 
evaluation criteria; they will then publish the results.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "China Issues Loans To Support Six </F>
Types of State-Owned Loss-Making Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (HSIN WAN PAO)--The relevant 
quarters in China recently decided to adopt a preferential 
policy this year and next for state-owned industrial 
enterprises, especially for the six types of enterprises, with 
regard to offering loans of circulating funds. 
  It has been a serious phenomenon for a long time that 
state-owned enterprises owe one another loan repayments and this 
seriously hinders their operations. For this reason, it is very 
necessary for the state to concentrate some capital to clear the 
debts of key industries in addition to settling bank bills to 
strengthen credit measures by the banks. 
  It has been learned that the state-owned loss-making 
industrial enterprises for which the State has decided to give 
support in terms of circulating funds comprise the following six 
types: Enterprises whose products have a ready market and whose 
production and marketing rate is greater than 93 percent; 
foreign-trade export-oriented enterprises which make profits 
from exports and have export orders but lack circulating funds 
for the execution of contracts; enterprises whose production 
continues all the year round and whose products are marketed in 
a particular season or whose production lasts for a particular 
season and whose products are marketed all the year round; 
enterprises with clear loss-curbing goals; enterprises which 
ensure that [loss-curbing] measures are implemented; and those 
enterprises which have begun to produce profit-making products 
and hope to curb losses in one or two years. 
  For these six types of state-owned loss-making enterprises, 
the relevant banks will grant support loans using the average 
amount of the actual loans of circulating funds obtained between 
1991 and 1993 as the base. These enterprises should pay back 
the loans as scheduled in accordance with the loan contracts. 
If they fail to do so, their banks can stop offering loans to 
them. 
  This preferential circulating-fund policy also means that 
the 
State's loans to profit-making industrial enterprises this year 
and next generally will not be lower than the amounts in 1993. 
It will increase loans to enterprises whose returns are good 
appropriately, in keeping with deposit status of the banks in 
the current year. 
  When deciding to offer loans of circulating funds to 
state-owned enterprises, the relevant quarters specifically 
stressed the need to pay attention to integrating production and 
marketing and to continue to strictly limit the production of 
unmarketable and overstocked products in keeping with the 
principle of "increasing the production of marketable products, 
limiting the production of less marketable products, and 
stopping the production of unmarketable products."

<F P=106> [By Ma Zhiping: "System to Make Shops Responsible For </F>
Goods"] 
  [Text] Shops and manufacturers will no longer be able to 
shrug off the complaints of customers in the near future. 
  The Ministry of Internal Trade plans to introduce a 
"commodity accountability system" to all State and 
collectively-owned stores later this year. 
  The proposal has been welcomed by consumers. 
  "This is an important move which will make our work easier 
in 
the protection of consumers' rights," said a spokeswoman with 
the Beijing-based China Consumer Association. 
  But the new rule will need to be given more publicity in 
order to make it effective, she added. 
  Trials were set up in a number of State-owned stores in big 
cities last year. 
  The new system obliges State-owned stoles to handle 
consumers' complaints on sub-standard goods, offering a repair 
and exchange service and paying compensation if necessary. 
  In this way, customers can settle their grievances quickly. 
And shopkeepers will not be able to pass on responsibility to 
producers. 
  Under the commodity accountability system store managers and 
consumers can confront the producer if a shoddy product causes 
injuries. 
  Only when consumers demands have been met other concerns 
such 
as quality and transport problems can be addressed by the stores 
to the manufacturers and the transporters. 
  But the system will not apply to privately owned shops and 
markets. 
  The aim of the new system is to help establish and maintain 
a 
reliable image for State and collective-owned stores and prevent 
shoddy commodities from entering these shops the official said. 
  Since the trials were started last March the new practice 
has 
been successfully implemented in 100 State-run department stores 
in Tianjin, Beijing, and Harbin. 
  Business volume in Tianjin stores increased by 30 per cent 
in 
six months since the system was introduced. And the number of 
consumer complaints dropped by 50 per cent. 
  In Beijing 50 shops and department stores were praised by 
the 
public for their improved service.

  [Text] On 17-21 May, provincial Governor Zhu Senlin and 
relevant responsible persons of the provincial government went 
deep into grass-roots units in Zhaoqing city to find out about 
the situation in the city and listen to their opinions. They 
worked together with local leaders to study how to further grasp 
well the work of deepening and promoting reform and maintaining 
stability. 
  During the inspection tour, some enterprises raised the 
issue 
of rising of production costs due to the shortage of funds and 
price increases of raw and processed materials, which 
constrained economic development. Zhu Senlin stressed that they 
must mainly rely on their own efforts to overcome difficulties, 
and that they must adopt their own methods even if they make use 
of foreign capital, or speed up capital turnover. He affirmed 
the method employed by Zhaoqing city of expanding the base and 
making use of limited funds to ensure circulating funds for 
normal production, funds for developing agriculture and 
purchasing agricultural and sideline products, and funds for 
purchasing products to be exported.

<F P=106> [Article by Zheng Zhifang (6774 1807 5364) From "Earnestly </F>
Study the Third Volume of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" column: "It Is Necessary to Constantly and 
Tightly Grasp the Agricultural Problem"] 
  [Text] Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always paid great 
attention to problems concerning agriculture, rural areas, and 
peasants. In many articles in the third volume of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, he makes brilliant 
expositions about the importance of problems concerning 
agriculture, rural areas, and peasants, and about ways to 
promote agricultural production and improve rural work. 
Earnestly studying these expositions is of great importance to 
upholding the ideological guidance that agriculture serves as 
the foundation of the national economy, to further invigorating 
agricultural production and improving rural work, to maintaining 
social stability, and to promoting a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the economy. 
<H5>  We Must Never Forget Agriculture Is the Foundation of the </H5>
Economy 
  In sizing up the situation, studying problems, or making 
policy decisions, Comrade Xiaoping has always attached top 
strategic importance to problems concerning agriculture, rural 
areas, and peasants. He has repeated on many occasions that 
agriculture plays a key strategic role in our effort to develop 
agricultural production. He said: "In our strategy for economic 
development, energy and transport are the key points, so is 
agriculture." He believed that whether the Chinese economy will 
develop depends on whether rural areas make progress and on 
whether peasants can lead a good life. Whether the objective of 
quadrupling the 1980 GNP will be attained by the end of this 
century mainly depends on the efforts of peasants, who account 
for 80 percent of the Chinese population. Stability in rural 
areas is the foundation of national stability. "A total of 80 
percent of the Chinese population resides in rural areas, so 
whether China will maintain stability mainly depends on whether 
rural areas will maintain stability. Even if we have done a 
good job in urban areas, we will go nowhere without a stable 
countryside serving as the foundation." "There will be no 
overall political stability without rural stability. We will 
not shake off poverty if the peasants do not shake off poverty." 
Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly told the whole party: 
"Agriculture is the foundation of the economy, we must never 
forget this"; "it is essential to have a constant and firm grasp 
of agriculture." The priority placed by Comrade Xiaoping on 
problems concerning agriculture, rural areas, and peasants is 
based on his consideration of international and internal 
economics and politics, so what he has said is highly pertinent. 
We must arrive at an adequate understanding of his expositions. 
We must regard problems concerning agriculture, rural areas, 
and peasants as important issues affecting social stability, 
consolidation of the achievements we have made in reform, our 
efforts to attain the objective of the modernization drive, and 
the future and destiny of the party and the country. 
  However, in the previous period, quite a number of leading 
cadres have failed to really put agriculture in the first place 
of the economic work. Especially in the process of developing a 
market economy, leading cadres in many places shifted their 
energy elsewhere, neglecting or relaxing their leadership over 
agriculture. To counter this tendency, Comrade Jiang Zemin, in 
speeches at the national conferences on rural work held in 
October 1993 and March this year, called on the party membership 
to conscientiously study Comrade Xiaoping's important 
expositions about agriculture and sum up our experience in 
developing agricultural production to further uphold the 
ideological guidance that agriculture is the foundation for the 
economy. He said: As we step up reform and open China more 
widely to the outside world, there will be more need for us to 
attach importance to, safeguard, and strengthen agriculture. It 
is necessary to really, rather than superficially, practically, 
rather than verbally, and wholeheartedly, rather than 
half-heartedly, strengthen agriculture as the foundation for the 
economy. Provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal party 
committees must devote great efforts to rural work and 
prefectural and county party committees must also focus on it. 
The success of rural work should become an important criterion 
for appraising the work results of key leading cadres. 
<H5>  Grain Problem Is the Principal Problem for Agricultural </H5>
Production 
  Comrade Xiaoping has given top priority to the grain 
problem. 
He believed that the grain problem is part and parcel of 
agricultural production. While talking to responsible members 
of the State Planning Commission, the State Commission for 
Restructuring the Economy, and the department in charge of 
agricultural production in January 1983, Comrade Xiaoping said: 
"We should have an overall plan for agricultural development. 
We must first of all increase grain production... and basically 
solve the problem of adequate grain production by 2000. This is 
an important strategic plan." 
  After listening to reports by 
leading comrades of the central authorities on the economic 
situation in June 1986, he pointed out: "In exercising 
macroeconomic control, we should put agriculture in an 
appropriate place, bearing in mind the general objective of 
producing 480 billion kg of grain per year by the end of this 
century. The practice of importing a large quantity of grain 
should not be repeated in a few years, because that will affect 
our economic growth rate." 
  Grain is the people's most fundamental means of subsistence 
and also an important raw material for light industry, so it has 
a direct bearing on the people's basic livelihood and immediate 
interest, on social stability, and on economic development as a 
whole. Especially in China, a big country with 1.1 billion 
people, if something has gone wrong with grain production, no 
country in the world can save us. If we live on imported grain, 
we will be controlled by others. Therefore, we must, at any 
time, never forget this important matter regarding independence 
and self-reliance of our nation, must pay close attention to the 
matter, and try our utmost to solve the problem, never relaxing 
our vigilance a bit. 
<H5>  Township Enterprises Must Be Developed and Upgraded </H5>
  Comrade Xiaoping has paid great attention to the development 
of township enterprises and has given a high appraisal of 
achievements made by township enterprises. He said gladly in 
June 1987: "The most rewarding achievement totally unexpected 
in rural reform is the setting up of township enterprises. Many 
small enterprises in various trades suddenly emerged as a new 
force and worked together to develop a market economy. This 
does not reflect the merits and achievements of the central 
authorities. Township enterprises have been growing at an 
annual rate of 20 percent for several years." He believes that 
the township enterprise is an invention of the Chinese peasants. 
Comrade Xiaoping has adequately affirmed the important role the 
township enterprises have played in rural reform and 
development. After listing township enterprise achievements such 
as "helping promote rural development," "giving jobs to people 
who accounted for 50 percent of surplus rural labor," and 
"building up a large number of small new towns," he has 
emphasized that "township enterprises are very important" and 
that "they must be developed and upgraded." 
  Thanks to the great concern of Comrade Xiaoping and under 
the 
leadership of the party Central Committee and the State Council, 
China's township enterprises have developed and been upgraded 
more rapidly over the last few years. They have made gratifying 
achievements and have become the mainstay of our rural economy 
and an important pillar of our national economy. In 1993, 
China's township enterprise output value totaled 2.9 trillion 
yuan, net profit was 160 billion yuan, taxes turned over to the 
state totaled 95 billion yuan, export volume was 190 billion 
yuan, and 112 million workers were employed. By now, the annual 
gross output value of township enterprises constitutes over 60 
percent of the gross rural output value and "one-third" of 
China's gross industrial output value. History has proved and 
will continue to prove that if the countryside is to become 
moderately prosperous, it is essential to develop township 
enterprises. The township enterprise serves as our greatest 
project for supporting poor areas and achieving common 
prosperity and a fundamental guarantee for attaining 
agricultural modernization. 
<H5>  Appropriate Policies and Science Are Essential to </H5>
Agricultural Development 
  After making an in-depth analysis of our experience in 
developing agriculture, Comrade Xiaoping clearly pointed out 
that "two things are essential to agricultural development: 
appropriate policies and science." He adequately affirmed the 
correctness of the party's policy on introducing the contract 
responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration 
linked to output. The system has proved effective and must not 
be changed for a long time, he said. He told the third full 
session of the Central Advisory Commission: "If we change the 
present policies, the state and the people will suffer losses, 
so the people, the 800 million peasants in particular, will come 
out against us. If we change present rural polices, we will 
immediately lower peasant living standards." "Judging by our 
experience, the present generation must not change the policies, 
neither must future generations." In the meantime, he was fully 
positive of the "endless development and role of science and 
technology" and vigorously advocated "tilling the land in a 
scientific way" and invigorating agriculture by applying 
scientific and technological achievements and promoting 
education. In a speech given in January 1983, he pointed out 
that "great efforts should be made to intensify research on 
agricultural science and technology and train more agricultural 
technicians, as well as to tackle key problems in agricultural 
scientific research." 
  In line with Comrade Xiaoping's thinking on agricultural 
development, that is, that appropriate policies and science are 
essential to agricultural development, we must continue to 
stabilize the party's policies for rural areas and improve and 
develop them in practice. In addition, we must take effective 
measures to promote research on agricultural science and 
education and to propagate advanced agricultural techniques. 
<H5>  We Have To Make Two Breakthroughs To Enhance Agricultural </H5>
Reform and Development 
  Comrade Xiaoping told several leading comrades of the 
central 
authorities in March 1990: "From a long-term point of view, we 
have to make two breakthroughs to enhance China's socialist 
agricultural reform and development. The first breakthrough is 
to abolish the people's commune and introduce the contract 
responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration 
linked to output. This is a major advance, we must not change 
the system for a long time. The second breakthrough is to 
operate farming on an appropriate scale and develop the 
collective economy to meet the needs of tilling the land in a 
scientific way and of socialization of production. This is 
another major advance and needs, of course, a long period." 
  The contract responsibility system on a household basis with 
remuneration linked to output is a great creation by Chinese 
peasants. Its greatest advantage has manifested itself in 
thoroughly doing away with the practice of "allowing everyone to 
eat from the same big pot" and thus enabling the peasants to 
make land management decisions on their own. The system has 
greatly mobilized peasant enthusiasm for production and thus 
greatly liberated productive forces in rural areas. With the 
development of rural productive forces and the planned economy 
being replaced by the market economy, the contradictions between 
separation of landholding and intensive management and between 
individual household operation and socialized production have 
become increasingly acute. To solve these contradictions, it is 
necessary to operate farming on an appropriate scale and develop 
the collective economy. This is a very difficult policy issue. 
We must properly explore and analyze our experience before we 
can work out the guiding principle and policies, as well as 
measures to implement the principle and policies. Our 
fundamental approach is that we must work energetically rather 
than rashly to attain our objective. Judging from our 
successful experience in introducing the cooperative joint- 
stock system in the countryside, the system should serve as a 
vanguard in deepening rural reforms and achieving the second 
breakthrough in the countryside.

<F P=106> [From the "Chinese Economic News" column: "Farm Loans </F>
Boosted for Second Half of the Year"] 
  [Text] It has been revealed that, to further increase 
inputs to the agricultural sector, the State Council has decided 
that the proportion of farm loans in the increase of all loans 
for the second half of the year would be raised to 10 percent 
from last year's 6 percent. 
  It has been said that this year the agricultural bank will 
continue to fix the focus of credit loan work on supporting 
agriculture and rural economic development and developing 
industries and products with high additional value, high 
commodity rates, and high exchange rates, while supporting the 
implementation of a strategy for reinvigorating agriculture with 
science and technology, such as the "Spark Plan." The bank 
will also focus on the implementation of the plan for supporting 
the impoverished in the Eighth Five-Year Plan and will guide 
enterprises to enter the market, participate in competition, 
amass funds, and select a number of key projects of enterprises 
in townships and towns to accelerate their technological 
transformation. 
  In 1994, the agricultural bank plans to make arrangements 
for 
farm loans in terms of 29 billion yuan, up by 28 percent from 
the 1993 plan. 
  Since the beginning of this year, the state has decided to 
give focal support to 500 counties that produce commodity grains 
and 150 counties that produce high-quality cotton; at the same 
time, it will set up a number of "two-high, one good-quality" 
exemplary farm zones with various characteristics in different 
regions in a planned way. The agricultural bank will do a good 
job of work in supervising the corresponding loans.

<F P=106> [By reporters Wang Yanbin (3769 6066 1755) and Zhao Lianqing </F>
(6392 6647 1987)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 23 May (XINHUA) -- As summer approaches, 
all localities will be busy with three summer jobs -- summer 
harvest, summer planting, and summer field management. As 
information from various major summer grain and oil-bearing seed 
production bases indicates, this year's summer crops are growing 
well. Especially since the last 10-day period of April, there 
have been several rainfalls which are very beneficial to the 
bumper harvest of wheat. Despite damage from drought, 
waterlogging, and freezing, the total output of summer 
oil-bearing seed crops is expected to be higher than last year. 
At present, summer crops are entering the yellow maturity 
period from north to south. According to experts from the 
Ministry of Agriculture, this is a critical stage for the bumper 
harvest of wheat, and it is imperative to pay attention to field 
management to ensure a bumper harvest of summer crops. 
  How can we do a good job in promoting short-term 
agricultural 
production? According to relevant departments of the central 
authorities, the following five points are very important: 
  First, it is necessary to have a full understanding of the 
importance of field management during the yellow maturity 
period. We should seize the opportunity and use every possible 
means to increase the grain number and grain weight so as to 
enhance the per unit output and make up for what is affected by 
the decreased sown acreage. All localities should take 
effective measures according to local conditions. In 
particular, they should provide enough irrigation water during 
the filling period. This is a critical measure for increasing 
the grain weight. 
  Second, government departments at all levels should 
strengthen guidance and service to agricultural production. 
Cadres at all levels should go down to grass-roots units and 
help peasants solve concrete problems. Departments in charge of 
means of production, farming machines, oil, and transportation 
should properly arrange the production and shipment of various 
means of agricultural production and ensure their supply in a 
timely fashion. Agricultural departments at all levels should 
organize scientific and technological personnel to go down to 
the first line of production and provide technical guidance and 
pest prevention service. 
  Third, it is necessary to always foster an ideology of 
fighting against natural disasters to reap bumper harvests. 
Efforts should be made to avert peril. According to weather 
predictions, in the last 10-day period of May, there will be two 
rainfalls and possibly rainstorms, gales, or hail. In addition, 
dry winds might come at the end of May. All agricultural 
production areas should closely watch the weather changes and do 
their best to prepare to prevent various natural disasters. 
They should also do a good job in pest prevention. Once the 
harvesting begins, all-out efforts should be made to bring the 
crops in as soon as possible. 
  Fourth, good preparation should be made for the purchase of 
summer crops. Governments at all levels should take active 
measures to ensure enough funds before the purchase season 
arrives. Departments at all levels should be responsible for 
their work. Efforts should be made to ensure that peasants will 
not be given IOU's for crops sold to the government. Financial, 
grain, and banking departments should work together, pay 
attention to the market situation, and ensure the pooling of 
enough funds for the purchase. It is necessary to strengthen 
management of the grain and edible oil market, and ensure the 
smooth progress of purchase work. 
  Fifth, while concentrating on the purchase of summer crops, 
all localities should lose no time in promoting summer field 
management and summer planting. Particular effort should be 
made to enlarge sown acreage of summer crops. 
  Relevant departments of the central authorities held that 
the 
bumper harvest of summer crops has a direct bearing on this 
year's agricultural production. All localities should try every 
possible way to achieve a good result in "the summer harvest, 
summer planting, and summer field management." They should work 
hard in the summer to enjoy a good harvest in autumn. In this 
way, they can ensure a year-round bumper harvest.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today that history is 
the best possible judgement for an historical event. 
  Wu Jianmin made the above statement in reply to a question 
about the "June 4" incident at today's news conference, 
stressing that over the last five years, China has enjoyed 
political stability, economic development, and further 
improvement in people's livelihood. The status quo accords with 
the wish of the Chinese people and meets the need of the region 
and the world for peace, stability, and development. 
  Wu Jianmin quoted Jiang Zemin as saying in a meeting with 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir on 12 May: Looking back at 
the political turmoil that occurred between late spring and 
early summer in 1989, I feel that China would not have been 
enjoying today's stability if it had not taken resolute measures 
then.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today that China will 
not accept conditions attached by the United States to the 
renewal of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status. 
  At today's press briefing, reporters from all countries 
focused their questions on the MFN issue. We are still waiting 
for the decision made by President Clinton, Wu Jianmin said, we 
hope that President Clinton will make a wise decision. 
  Last year President Clinton issued an executive order 
linking 
human rights and other issues with China's MFN trading status. 
A year has elapsed and the choice to be made by the U.S. 
President and administration has attracted public attention. 
  The Chinese side has always maintained that trade should not 
be linked with unrelated issues, Wu Jianmin said, such a 
practice is rare in the world. China has trade ties with more 
than 200 countries and regions in the world and we never had any 
problems with them. 
  As for the differences between China and the United States 
on 
the question of human rights, Wu stated, China believes that 
dialogue can be held on the basis of equality and mutual 
respect, and the purpose is to increase mutual understanding. 
China is against interference in the internal affairs of 
another country. 
  Wu Jianmin stressed that international trade should be based 
on equality and mutual benefit. The unilateral exertion of 
pressure and adoption of restrictive measures with regard to 
trade is not in conformity with international practices. These 
measures are unwise as they harm the interests of both sides.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
supports the resumption of China's GATT membership on condition 
that the latter's trade regime conforms to GATT (General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), U.S. Deputy Trade 
Representative Booth Gardner said here today. 
  "The United States strongly support China's accession to the 
GATT and membership in the WTO (World Trade Organization). But 
we support China's accession on the basis of China's willingness 
to enter the GATT on the terms of the GATT. Where China's trade 
regime is not consistent with the GATT, it must change," Gardner 
told a session of the 27th international meeting of the Pacific 
Basin Economic Council (PBEC). 
  He said the U.S. wants to "see China emerge strong, 
prosperous and stable" and is seeking a "balanced way for our 
two countries to develop a sound, cooperative relationship". 
  "We are working with China over our differences so we can 
move forward together. We want that effort to succeed," he 
added. 
  To a question whether he sees it reasonable for China to be 
requested to undertake the obligations similar to that of the 
developed countries regarding China's reentry into the GATT, 
Gardner said the U.S. thinks that "there can be a transition 
time" and the U.S. is willing to negotiate about the matter.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Farm Income To Decline if China Stops Buying" -- </F>
XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Washington, May 25 (XINHUA) -- U.S. farm income will 
decline by nearly 100 million U.S. dollars a year if China, the 
buyer of one-fifth of American wheat exports, stops doing so, a 
congressional report said today. 
  By 1996, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) said, the 
U.S. would experience export losses of 250 million bushels of 
wheat if China retaliates the withdrawal of its most favored 
nation (MFN) trade status. 
  The resulting weaker demand and larger U.S. stocks will 
depress U.S. wheat prices by about 15 cents per bushel by 1996, 
the report said. 
  President Clinton will decide by June 3 whether to renew 
China's MFN status, which makes China, like most other nations 
in the world, enjoy the lowest possible tariffs in its exports 
to the U.S.. 
  "The psychological effect of losing a major foreign wheat 
market might tend to push U.S. prices down even further in the 
future," the CRS said in its report to the House Committee on 
Agriculture. 
  The CRS stressed, meanwhile, that China will continue to be 
"a significant buyer" of American wheat assuming that China's 
MFN status will be extended. 
  China became a major U.S. farm export market in 1987, when 
it 
broke into the ranks of the top 20 importers of farm products. 
Wheat has amounted to between 60 and 92 percent of China's farm 
imports from the U.S.. 
  Since 1989, however, China's rank in wheat imports has 
slipped, with the purchase of 376 million dollars of U.S. wheat 
last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
  According to the department, the Chinese typically prefer to 
buy high quality, high protein wheats, such as hard red spring 
or winter wheat, which they mill for flour for bread and other 
baked goods. 
  "Other wheat exporting countries," the report said, "hold 
enough wheat stocks to fill China's lost supplies from the U.S., 
should China choose to reject U.S. wheat exports altogether" in 
the next three years. 
  In addition to wheat, China purchases a broad array of U.S. 
farm products, including grains, soybeans, cotton, livestock, 
horticultural products and even wine and tobacco. 
  Wheat accounted for half of the value of U.S. exports to 
China in 1992. A major proportion of U.S. wheat exports to 
China have been subsidized by the U.S. Government.

  [Text] Hanoi, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The United States and 
Vietnam have officially decided to establish liaison offices in 
each other's capitals, Hanoi and Washington, in an attempt to 
normalize the two countries' relations. 
  The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the 
decision would create favorable conditions for the two 
governments to solve issues of common concern and was in the 
interests of the two peoples for achieving peace, stability and 
development in the region. 
  The move follows a decision in February this year by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton to officially lift his country's 
30-year-old trade embargo against Vietnam. 
  On May 20 and 21, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston 
Lord and Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai exchanged 
letters about the final decision on setting up the liaison 
offices. 
  They agreed that the offices will perform their roles under 
the Vienna Convention regulations which specified consular 
relations, signed by the U.S. and Vietnamese governments in 1963.

  [Text] Washington, May 25 (XINHUA) -- U.S. State Secretary 
Warren Christopher met with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres at the State Department today. 
  "They had an extensive review of the state of play and all 
four of the tracks of the Middle East peace process," Department 
Spokesman Mike McCurry said at a regular news briefing. 
  They reviewed the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
Agreement and discussed some of the multilateral negotiations, 
McCurry said. 
  After meeting with Christopher about 50 minutes, Peres had a 
working lunch with Undersecretary Peter Tarnoff and some other 
officials. 
  Peres and Tarnoff discussed a range of global issues such as 
democratization efforts around the world, some aspects of the 
new U.S. criteria on participation in U.N. peacekeeping and 
non-proliferation, according to McCurry. 
  They also discussed "East Asia as a region and some efforts 
that we both have in common as we pursue interests in East 
Asia," he said. 
  Asked about recent statement by Palestine Liberation 
Organization Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on "holy war," McCurry said 
that "the important thing is that the parties need to talk to 
each other and not surprise each other." 
  He also said they need to keep the commitments that they 
have 
made to each other and to use the consultative mechanism that 
they have established to resolve any questions that arise.

  [Text] Athens, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Greece today expressed 
its displeasure over statements made by U.S. State Department 
Spokesman Mike McCurry who said he had "no reliable evidence to 
indicate that the Albanian Government is oppressing the Greek 
minority." 
  Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that the 
statements by McCurry did not satisfy the Greek Government and 
were "inadequate". 
  Greece's ambassador in Washington, Luukas Tsilas, made 
repeated representations to the State Department reiterating 
that the Greek positions and explanations were provided, 
Venizelos said. 
  "The State Department," Venizelos continued, "said that the 
explanations given were detailed but that they had not been 
accurately translated in the statement made by Mr. McCurry when 
he briefed reporters in Washington." 
  Meanwhile, the spokesman rejected claims contained in an 
Albanian Foreign Ministry announcement that it had evidence 
"proving that six ethnic Greeks were in illegal possession of 
arms, had connections with a Greek secret service and were 
engaged in secessionist activities." 
  "No complete and substantiated arguments were ever presented 
during the meetings between the Greek and Albanian foreign 
ministers in Zurich or between the delegations of the two 
countries in Ioannina, northern Greece," Venizelos said. 
  Venizelos reiterated that Greece was not prepared to be the 
target of slanderous, unfounded accusations and had displayed 
its good intentions for an improvement in relations with Tirana. 
  "But the Albanian Government must realize that any 
improvement depends on its respect for the human rights of the 
Greek minority," Venizelos stressed. 
  "If there is any evidence," he continued, "it should have 
been presented during the diplomatic contacts between Athens and 
Tirana. From there on, Albania bears the burden of proving that 
it is a state ruled by law."

  [Text] Jakarta, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The 3rd International 
Textile and Garment Machinery Exhibition (ITGME'94) was opened 
here today. 
  Taking part in the show, which lasts to May 30, are more 
than 
182 textile and garment machinery producers and suppliers from 
20 countries and regions, such as Denmark, France, Germany, Hong 
Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, China, the United Kingdom 
and the United States. 
  The exhibitors are showing their high-tech weaving, 
spinning, 
knitting, dyeing and printing, sewing, embroidery, pressing, 
finishing and other relevant machineries. 
  This important exhibition will also provide the customers 
with the latest information regarding the latest innovation in 
textile and garment machineries. 
  In his written speech, Indonesian Minister of Industry 
Tungky 
Ariwibowo said that this exhibition will be a useful means 
linking manufacturers and customers for exchanging of 
information on market and technology. 
  The textile and garment industry has developed rapidly in 
Indonesia for the last few years, becoming one of the pillars of 
the country's economy besides oil and gas. 
  The export income from the industry jumped from 4,000 
million 
U.S. dollars in 1991 to 6,000 million U.S. dollars in 1992. 
With a slight decline, the export earning of textile and 
garment in 1993 maintained at 5,900 million U.S. dollars. 
  The comparatively weak competitive power of Indonesia's 
textile products is reportedly the main reason for the drop. 
Therefore, the textile industry in the country is in urgent 
need of modernization of equipments, so as to raise productive 
efficiency and upgrading of products. 
  According to data from the Ministry of Industry, the import 
volumes of textile and garment machinery in 1990, 1991 and 1992 
were 970 million, 1,372 million and 530 million U.S. dollars, 
respectively, while that for January to October in 1993 period 
was 450 million dollars. 
  Xu Jinchang, head of the Chinese delegation, which is the 
biggest one in the exhibition, told XINHUA that China-made 
textile and garment machineries in the medium level are suitable 
for the Indonesian market. 
  The Chinese businessmen would like to use this exhibition as 
an opportunity to make extensive contacts with their Indonesian 
counterparts and exchange information and experiences with them 
to promote bilateral cooperation in the field of textile and 
garment machinery industry.

  [Text] Belgrade, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The Yugoslav Federal 
Republic today ruled out the possibility of Joining the NATO 
proposed Partnership for Peace program. 
  Speaking at a press conference here today, Radoje Kontic, 
the 
prime minister of the Federal Republic, said that his country 
maintains a foreign policy of independence, and will not seek 
any tie with NATO. 
  He also said that the country will not join any other 
military alliance either. 
  This is the first time the government of the Yugoslav 
Federal 
Republic rules out the possibility of joining the NATO 
Partnership for Peace program. 
  Kontic also said that his government supports all peace 
proposals that treat the three warring sides in Bosnia on an 
equal foot, and respect the interests of the people of all sides. 
  He also said that any peace proposal should include the 
lifting, or at least the reducing, of the current economic 
sanctions against his country. 
  "To continue maintaining the sanctions is to encourage the 
Muslims to continue the war," he said, adding that the sanctions 
are against humanitarian principles and are damaging the image 
of the United Nations. 
  The sanctions are not only bringing tremendous losses to the 
economy of Yugoslavia, but also to its neighboring countries, he 
said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Foreign 
Ministry released a statement here today on U.S. President 
Clinton's decision to extend China's most favored nation (MFN) 
trading status. The full text is as follows: 
  On May 26, President Bill Clinton of the United States 
announced his decision to extend China's MFN status for 
1994-1995 and to delink future annual MFN review from human 
rights issue. This decision will create favorable conditions 
for the further strengthening and expansion of trade and 
economic cooperation between the two sides and the improvement 
and growth of the overall relations between the two countries. 
It therefore serves the fundamental interests of both countries 
and peoples. The Chinese Government and people welcome this 
decision of President Clinton. 
  The MFN treatment that China and the United States grant to 
each other in accordance with the agreement on trade relations 
between the two governments is purely a reciprocal and 
mutually-beneficial arrangement that serves the interests of 
both sides. It constitutes the basis for normal trade between 
them. We have consistently opposed linking MFN with non-trade 
issues or attaching conditions and requirements. What the U.S. 
side did in the past few years on the MFN issue has impaired the 
bilateral trade and economic exchanges and the overall relations 
between the two countries, to the strong dissatisfaction of the 
two peoples. We have to point out with regret that while 
announcing the renewal of China's MFN status, the U.S. side 
stated that the existing sanctions against China would be 
maintained. It should be pointed out in particular that the 
U.S. side has made unwarranted charges about human rights 
situation in China. This constitutes an interference in China's 
internal affairs, which is totally unacceptable to us. We hope 
that the U.S. Government, proceeding from the fundamental 
interests of the two countries and two peoples, will immediately 
remove all sanctions against China and abandon all measures 
detrimental to the development of bilateral relations. 
  China and the United States share broad interests. The 
current situation offers a historical opportunity for the 
enhancement of Sino-American relations. The Chinese Government 
attaches importance to these relations and has made and will 
continue to make major efforts for their improvement and growth. 
We hope that the U.S. Government, on its part, will take a 
realistic and forward-looking stand in the overall interests of 
Sino-American relations and take concrete action to show its 
sincerity for enhancing relations between the two countries. We 
are convinced that so long as both sides strictly abide by the 
guidelines and principles set forth in the three Sino-American 
joint communiques, enhance mutual trust, reduce troubles, 
develop cooperation and refrain from confrontation, 
Sino-American relations will enjoy smooth and healthy progress.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's decision to extend China's most favored nation (MFN) 
trading status is conducive to the improvement and development 
of Sino-U.S. relations, especially the enhancement of bilateral 
trade and economic co-operation, said a spokesman for the 
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-Operation 
(MFTEC) here today. 
  On may 26 President Clinton announced his decision to extend 
China's MFN status for 1994-1995 and to delink future annual MFN 
reviews from the human rights issue. 
  "We welcome President Clinton's decision, which accords with 
the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples," the 
spokesman said. 
  He said that the MFN treatment that China and the United 
States grant to each other is a reciprocal and mutually 
beneficial arrangement. It is the core of bilateral trade 
agreements and serves as the foundation stone for bilateral 
trade relations. 
  China has consistently opposed linking MFN with non-trade 
issues or attaching conditions or requirements, said the 
spokesman. 
  The Chinese Government always attaches great importance to 
Sino-U.S. trade relations, and it has made major efforts for the 
maintenance, improvement and growth of such relations, he said. 
  The actions the U.S. side has taken in the past few years in 
connection with the MFN issue has done harm to bilateral trade 
and the overall relations between the two countries, and the 
peoples of the two countries. U.S. entrepreneurs and a great 
number of consumers especially have expressed their concerns and 
worries, the spokesman said. 
  "We welcome the positive efforts that the U.S. side made to 
change this situation " said the spokesman. 
  "But," he said, "we have to point out with great regret [shi 
fen yi han 0577 0433 6695 2013] that, while announcing the 
renewal of China's MFN status, the U.S. side stated that the 
existing sanctions against China would be maintained." 
  The spokesman expressed the hope that the U.S. Government 
would, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the two 
countries and peoples, remove all sanctions against China, so 
that Sino-U.S. trade relations can enjoy smooth and healthy 
progress. 
  He pointed out that the current situation offers a 
historical 
opportunity for the enhancement of Sino-American relations, 
especially bilateral trade relations. 
  "We believe that so long as both sides, on the basis of 
mutual respect equality, and mutual benefit, adopt positive 
measures and eliminate the artificially imposed obstacles, the 
trade relations between China the U.S. will be further 
developed," the spokesman said.

Clinton Thursday [26 May] announced his decision to renew 
China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status and delink the 
MFN renewal from human rights issues. 
  Meanwhile, he decided to ban imports of guns and ammunition 
from China. 
  He also announced that the United States would maintain the 
existing sanctions imposed on China since 1989, including the 
denial of participation in the U.S. trade and development 
assistance program, U.S. opposition to non-basic human needs 
loans to China by the World Bank and suspension of weapons 
deliveries. 
  Speaking at a White House press conference, Clinton said 
that 
extending MFN "will avoid isolating China and instead will 
permit us to engage the Chinese with not only economic contacts 
but with cultural, educational and other contacts." "We have to 
see our relations with China within the broader context of our 
policies within the Pacific-Asian region," he noted.

contacts." 
  "We have to see our relations with China within the broader 
context of our policies within the Asian-Pacific region," he 
said. 
  "Our relationship with China is important to all Americans," 
he stressed, adding that China "is a major factor in Asian and 
global security." 
  "China is also the world's fastest-growing economy. Over 
eight billion dollars of United States exports to China last 
year supported over 150,000 American jobs," Clinton noted. 
  "We need to place our relationship into a larger and more 
productive framework," he said. 
  But at the same time, Clinton announced that the United 
States would maintain the existing sanctions imposed on China 
and ban imports of guns and ammunition from China, citing human 
rights reasons. 
  He said his government will maintain dialogue with China 
over 
human rights issues.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (AFP)--The main exporter of Chinese 
arms charged Friday [27 May] that US President Bill Clinton's 
decision to bar imports of Chinese firearms and ammunition was 
"discriminatory." A spokesman for the North Industrial Co 
(NORINCO) said, "Our arms exports to the United States have 
always been made in conformity with US law." 
  "The US side unilaterally decided to ban arms imports from 
China only. This measure is clearly discriminatory, and we 
would like to express our extreme displeasure," he said. The 
spokesman denied information published in the United States that 
NORINCO was owned by the Chinese military. "These reports are 
completely without foundation," he said. 
  Clinton announced Thursday the renewal for one year of most- 
favored-nation status for China, but at the same time slapped an 
embargo on about 200 million dollars in Chinese arms and 
ammunition imported annually into the United States. China is 
the United States' primary foreign supplier of rifles and 
handguns. Over the last three years, companies such as NORINCO, 
Polytechnology and Jinganco have sold about two million handguns 
to the US market, western experts said. 
  According to foreign experts, NORINCO has mainly exported 
hunting rifles, pistols and ammunition for non-military use to 
the US market. The Chinese are, in addition, suspected by some 
US circles of copying famous brands of guns and selling them 
overseas at prices that undercut the originals, one arms expert 
said. The defense sector, to which NORINCO belongs, has been 
forced in recent years to devote most of its activities to 
producing civilian items such as buses, mopeds and washing 
machines. About 70 percent of such companies' production is now 
for civilian purposes.

<F P=106> ["New Talk" column: "United States Extends China's Most- </F>
Favored-Nation Status for Another Year"] 
  [Text] After a protracted effort, U.S. President Bill 
Clinton has finally "turned around." He announced yesterday 
afternoon (0400 Asian time) the U.S. decision to extend China's 
Most Favored Nation (MFN) trading status for another year, going 
against the statement he made the same time last year that he 
might completely rescind China's MFN trading status next year. 
  In fact, Clinton almost made up his mind to "turn around" 
last fall. He made the first step toward this end by going to 
Seattle to preside over the Asian summit and by meeting with PRC 
Chairman Jiang Zemin for the first time since assuming office. 
  By that time, the United States had developed a new outlook 
on the international situation. After the dramatic changes in 
eastern Europe, the relations between the United States and 
Western Europe were not as close as they had been immediately 
following World War II. This was most clearly seen in the fact 
that several U.S. proposals for settling conflicts in former 
Yugoslavia were rejected by western countries. After the 
disintegration of the former Soviet Union, the United States 
sought to improve its relations with Russia. However, Yeltsin's 
position in Russia has been shaky, and he was not even able to 
appoint his trusted follower Gaidar as prime minister. 
Therefore, the importance of Russia for U.S. politics is 
questionable in the future. 
  Apart from political problems, there are economic problems. 
It is clear that Asia will grow further economically. 
President Clinton, who did not attach importance to Asia in the 
first part of his presidency, changed his outlook in the second 
half of the year. He felt it necessary to increase U.S. 
influence in Asia by establishing friendly ties with Asian 
countries anew so that the U.S. economy could draw new life from 
developing countries in this region, while China registered the 
greatest economic growth among Asian countries. 
  Over the last six months, the United States has adopted a 
carrot- and-stick policy toward China. While sending 
secretaries of the treasury, commerce, and agriculture 
departments to China to improve bilateral relations, Clinton 
sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher to China to apply 
pressure. Christopher tried to accomplish his task by bringing 
China to her knees. 
  The United States has actually been following the beaten 
path. In order to return to Asia, it has applied heavy pressure 
on Asian countries over the last six months. It has applied 
pressure on Malaysia and Indonesia over the trade union problem 
and on Singapore over the caning punishment inflicted on an 
American youth. It has also threatened to impose trade 
sanctions upon Japan under the Special 301 provision in 
connection with Japan's market barriers to U.S. goods and has 
threatened to use force against North Korea on the nuclear 
issue. However, these countries all rejected the U.S. demands. 
  China's approach has been open and above-board. While 
expressing its willingness to improve relations with the United 
States and sending trade groups to the United States to place 
orders, China has opposed the high U.S. pressure. In the end, 
Clinton was forced to "turn around" on his own, correcting the 
mistake he made a year ago. To soothe different political 
factions at home, he played tricks in the wording of the 
decision and the measures concerned to cover up his 
embarrassment. 
  He announced that he would extend China's MFN trading status 
for another year, rather than extending the status indefinitely, 
as favored by the majority of American people. While indicating 
that he will not link human rights with MFN trading status in 
the future, he insisted on imposing certain sanctions. But he 
will only impose sanctions on weapons valued at $200 million, 
while the Sino-U.S. trade volume will amount to $40 billion in 
the future. 
  The problem concerning trade between China and the United 
States, about which the two sides have been haggling for a long 
time, has finally been solved because the United States has 
withdrawn from its original position, though not without 
"embarrassment."

  [Text] Washington, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The U.S.-China 
Business Council, the leading organization of U.S. firms engaged 
in business with China, today welcomed President Clinton's 
decision to renew China's most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status 
without conditions. 
  In a statement on behalf of the organization, M.R. 
Greenberg, 
council chairman and chairman of American International Group, 
Inc., said the council applauds Clinton's decision as one that 
maintains normal trade and economic relations between the two 
countries. It not only permits the orderly and vigorous 
development of U.S. trade and investment activity with China, 
but also encourages the continued positive development of the 
U.S.-China relationship on a wide range of issues, he added. 
  He also said that "the council is extremely pleased that our 
two countries can now look forward to continued progress in the 
many areas where our interests and priorities coincide." 
  Throughout the debate over MFN, the U.S.-China Business 
Council strongly supported unconditional renewal. The council's 
250 member companies include many of the largest U.S. firms 
doing business with China. 
  Commenting on Clinton's decision announced here today, 
Willard Workman, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
said that "we are pleased that the administration recognizes 
trade is but one of a number of issues the United States and 
China must resolve together through cooperation, not 
confrontation."

  [Text] Washington, May 25 (XINHUA) -- More than a hundred 
members of the House of Representatives have declared that if 
President Clinton chooses to extend China's most-favored-nation 
trade status unconditionally they will support his decision. 
  The assurance of support was made in a letter sent to 
Clinton 
Tuesday [24 May], which was signed by 118 House democrats and 
republicans. In the letter, the congressmen emphasized the 
importance of Clinton's forthcoming announcement regarding 
China's MFN to the U.S.-China bilateral relations and American 
economic and security interests. They called for increased 
trade and economic links with China by unconditional extension 
of MFN. 
  Representative Jim Kolbe, an author of the letter, said that 
"If the President imposes trade sanctions at this juncture, we 
will see a destructive ripple effect on the carefully nurtured 
U.S.-China relationship that has evolved over the past 20 years."

  [Text] Washington, May 25 (XINHUA) -- More AIDS cases among 
people at hospitals have been found with heroin-related 
emergencies and this as many fear is the start of a new heroin 
epidemics, according to a report released at a U.S. House 
hearing today. 
  For people 35-year old and older with AIDS, heroin 
emergencies rose from 422 in 1990 to 2,128 in 1992, the report 
said. 
  Overall, heroin-related hospital emergencies soared 44 
percent in the first six months of 1993 over the same 1992 
period. 
  A recent official study also shows a 45 percent in PCP 
(pentachlorophenol) emergencies and a 61 percent rise in 
methamphetamine use in the United States. 
  Experts estimate the number of heroin addicts across the 
United States at more than half a million and the number is 
still growing, today's "USA TODAY" reported. 
  A report issued by the White House Drug Policy Control 
Office 
earlier this month cited marked increases in heroin use in the 
southwest, west and parts of the south of the United States, as 
well as in major cities like Washington, Boston, Denver and Los 
Angeles. 
  Part of the attraction is heroin's purity, the paper said, 
adding that street doses can be more than five times as potent 
as they were a decade ago.

  [Text] Beijing, may 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
and visiting Russian Prime Minister V. S. Chernomyrdin held 
talks at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here this morning. 
  In "a sincere and friendly atmosphere" the two sides 
exchanged views on bilateral ties and international issues of 
mutual concern. 
  Chernomyrdin arrived here Thursday [26 May] morning for a 
four- day official visit. 
  On bilateral ties, Li expressed his satisfaction with their 
healthy and smooth development. 
  China attaches great importance to its ties with Russia, Li 
said, adding that it constitutes a major part of China's foreign 
policy to develop long-term, stable and good-neighborly ties 
with Russia. 
  This is also the common aspiration of the two peoples, Li 
said. 
  "The Chinese Government and people are willing to constantly 
enrich the friendly co-operation, together with Russian side, on 
the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence," Li 
said. 
  China and Russia are two nations with global influence. The 
expansion of their ties is not only in the fundamental interests 
of the two sides, but also conducive to the peace and 
development of the region and the world, Li stated. 
  Li described the overall development of the bilateral 
economic and trade relations in recent years as "good". The 
two-way trade volume hit 7.68 billion U.S. Dollars-worth last 
year, well above the record in the days of the old Soviet Union, 
he said. 
  The geographical proximity and economic complementarity 
provide the economic and trade co-operation of various forms 
with many advantages, a great potential and bright prospects, Li 
said. 
  However, the present level of economic and trade 
co-operation 
is not high enough, Li conceded. The two sides should further 
upgrade their co-operative level and quality, explore new 
opportunities and encourage enterprises with credit on both 
sides to reinforce their co-operation so as to best play their 
role as the mainstay of bilateral co-operation. 
  In economic and trade relations, both sides should stick to 
the principle of equality and mutual benefit, Li said. 
  So long as the two sides take positive attitudes and enhance 
macro-control, the problems emerging from the growing economic 
and trade ties can be gradually resolved, thus creating more 
favorable conditions for the economic and trade co-operation 
between the two countries' localities and enterprises, Li said. 
  While noting the long and traditional contacts between the 
two peoples, Chernomyrdin said his visit is aimed at furthering 
friendly co-operation. 
  The seven agreements to be signed here embody the healthy 
and 
stable growth of the bilateral links, he said. 
  Touching on the agreement concerning the Sino-Russian 
borders, Chernomyrdin told his Chinese host that it is his hope 
that the border will remain forever as one of peace, friendship 
and co- operation, and bestow happiness on the two peoples. 
  Referring to the border trade and co-operation as the major 
part of Sino-Russian economic and trade co-operation, Li said 
that they should continue to develop and be given active 
guidance. 
  The improvement of transportation is crucial in the further 
development of the bilateral trade and economic co-operation, Li 
said. 
  He cited the Euroasian rail links, saying they should be 
given high priority and be fully employed. 
  In the meantime, the railways in the border areas of the two 
countries' eastern parts should be dovetailed, Li said, 
suggesting that China and Russia reinforce their co-operation in 
this respect. 
  Chernomyrdin expressed agreement with Li's proposal. The 
Euroasian railways are important, he said. The Siberian Railway 
should also be perfected and made full use of, he added. 
  Both leaders agreed that today's talks were fruitful and 
they 
will serve to propel the good-neighborly and mutually beneficial 
co- operation, especially the economic and trade ties, according 
to Chinese sources. 
  The two prime ministers also exchanged views on 
international 
issues. 
  Both held that the enhancement of their co-operation in 
world 
affairs will play a significant role in Asia's stability and 
security as well as in the overall improvement of international 
environment. 
  On behalf of the Russian Government, Chernomyrdin invited Li 
to visit Russia. Li accepted it. 
  Following the talks, the two prime ministers signed two 
governmental agreements concerning the management of borders and 
the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal 
evasion with respect to taxes on income. 
  They also presided over the signing of five other documents. 
They were: the memorandum of the Second Session of the 
Sino-Russian Joint Commission on Economic, Trade and Technical 
Co-Operation, the agreement between the two governments on the 
economic and technical co-operation of agricultural and 
industrial complexes, the agreement between the two governments 
on environmental protection cooperation, and the agreement 
between the two governments on the joint protection, regulation 
and value-addition of fishery resources on the Heilongjiang and 
Wusuli Rivers. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Russian Deputy Prime

  [Text] Seoul, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) has notified "the United Nations 
Command (UNC)" that it has established "the Korean People's Army 
Representative Mission at Panmunjom" to replace its component of 
the Military Armistice Committee, a UNC spokesman said here 
Wednesday. 
  The DPRK's Army Lt. Colonel Yu Yong-Chol made the 
notification on Tuesday at Panmunjom in his capacity as chief 
liaison officer for the newly-organized mission when he 
contacted UNC Lt. Colonel R. Flury. 
  Pyongyang, however, told the UNC that it will maintain its 
telephone lines at the joint duty officers' room at Panmunjom. 
  The spokesman said that the UNC plans to ask the DPRK to 
hold 
a senior secretaries' meeting of the Military Armistice 
Committee soon to discuss the issue. 
  The DPRK unilaterally withdrew its representatives from the 
Military Armistice Committee on April 27, demanding the Korean 
armistice agreement signed at the end of 1950-1953 Korean war be 
replaced by a peace accord.

Chiang Wei-ping (1203 4850 1627): "China-Japan Joint Venture 
Invests $65 Million in the Construction of an Industrial Park in 
Dalian"] 
  [Text] Dalian, 18 May (WEN WEI PO)--Today, a grand 
ceremony was held for the completion of the infrastructure 
construction in Dalian Industrial Park, a Sino-Japanese joint 
venture. Li Tieying, state councillor and member of the 
Political Bureau; and Kentaro Kiniwa, deputy director-general of 
the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, cut 
ribbons and praised the project as a typical example of the 
successful cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese 
Governments, as well as between the two countries' 
entrepreneurial circles. 
<H5>  First Project To Develop Whole Stretch of Land </H5>
  The Dalian Industrial Park is situated in the Dalian 
Economic 
and Technological Development Zone. It is the first project in 
which Japanese enterprises are developing a whole stretch of 
land in China; in fact, it is the first project in which a whole 
stretch of land is being developed in Dalian and even in China. 
The Chinese side makes up the management committee overseeing 
the Dalian Development Zone, and the Japanese side forms the 
committee overseeing the projects in the Dalian Industrial Park 
(this committee is made up of 22 Japanese enterprises, including 
C. Itoh, Mitsubishi, Marubeni Corporation, the Industrial Bank 
of Japan, and the Bank of Tokyo). Both sides have established 
the joint-venture Dalian Industrial Park Management Company, 
which makes a total investment of $65 million, of which the 
Chinese side contributes 20 percent and the Japanese side 80 
percent. The Chinese side's investment is in the form of the 
roads leading to the park, while the Japanese side has 
contributed hard currency. The operation period is 50 years, 
and the joint-venture company will buy 2.169 square km of land 
from the Dalian Development Zone Management Committee for its 
use; this land will primarily be transferred to the Japanese 
side. 
<H5>  China and Japan Carefully Study Feasibility </H5>
  The concept of the project was first proposed by the 
Japan-China Association for the Development of the Northeast 
during its visit to Dalian in February 1988 with the idea of 
creating an overseas industrial park for Japan's medium-size and 
small enterprises who seek to invest. In 1989, Japan's C. Itoh 
Commercial Company, the Bank of Tokyo, and the Marubeni 
Corporation expressed their intent of cooperation to the Dalian 
Development Zone; in December of the same year, as a result of 
the coordination by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry, the five establishments of C. Itoh, Marubeni, 
Mitsubishi, the Industrial Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Tokyo 
formed a close union to establish the Committee Overseeing 
Projects in the Dalian Industrial Park and to join forces to 
promote the undertaking. Thereafter, the project was upgraded 
to an international investment project with active support from 
the Japanese Government. The committee inspected the investment 
environment in the Dalian Development Zone and carried out 
research on related matters, leading to a feasibility report on 
the joint development of the Dalian Industrial Park. Hence, the 
committee joined hands with 22 influential large companies, 
enterprises, and financial institutions in Japan to found Dalian 
Industrial Park Company Limited, and former Prime Minister 
Takeshita attended the founding ceremony. In early 1992, the 
draft of the agreement on developing a whole stretch of land in 
Dalian Industrial Park was signed in Tokyo. In 1992, at the 
State Council's 101st executive meeting, which was presided over 
by Premier Li Peng, the feasibility report on the Dalian 
Industrial Park project was discussed and passed. On 5 October 
the same year, the official agreement was signed in Beijing, and 
Vice Premier Tian Jiyun attended the signing ceremony. 
<H5>  Substantive Progress in Canvassing Businesses and Funds </H5>
  Since 19 October 1992, projects involving 1.4 million cubic 
meters of earth and stone have been completed, 6.5 km of roads 
have been built, some pipes and cables have been laid, four 
power switching stations have been erected, two heat-suppling 
boiler rooms and one heat exchange station have been 
constructed, and all are of high quality. The work in 
canvassing businesses and funds has also made substantive 
progress. More than 300 enterprises specializing in machinery, 
electric appliances, chemical industry, and clothing have come 
to inspect the area and negotiate contracts, and a large number 
of well-known enterprises have come to inspect the projects in 
the industrial park, including Yamatake Honeywell Company 
Limited, Fuji Electric Company Limited, Toto Limited, and 
Konica, which are listed among the "world's 500 largest 
industrial enterprises" by "FORTUNE" magazine. Technologically 
advanced companies such as the (Namuko) Company and Takara Shuzo 
Company Limited, which are the pioneers in integrated circuit 
and genetic engineering, have also come on inspection visits. 
Reports have indicated that 27 enterprises have now received 
approval to enter the park, and their investments amount to $200 
million. Seven of the enterprises have begun work, and it is 
estimated that the land allocated for enterprises this year will 
reach 60 percent of the total area. Finally, the park is 
expected to attract a total of 100 enterprises and over $600 
million in investment.

<F P=106> ["International Forum" by Dong Ming (0392 2494): "Sensible </F>
Reflection"] 
  [Text] It seemed to some outsiders that the distortion of 
history by Nagano, former justice minister of Japan, was just a 
short episode. On 3 May, Shigeto Nagano, who had just taken 
office in the new cabinet, openly asserted that the Nanjing 
Massacre was a "fabrication," and Japan's aggression against the 
Asian countries was aimed at "liberating the colonies." After 
such remarks aroused strong protests in the neighboring Asian 
countries and also evoked condemnations inside Japan, Nagano was 
forced to renounce what he had said, offer an "apology," and 
resign from office on 7 May. 
  Although the Nagano incident came to an end, the discussion 
caused by this incident are continuing in Japan. Not only will 
the responsibility for this event be further affixed by the 
Diet, but the general public in Japan is also reflecting on the 
incident. Public opinion around the Nagano incident encapsulates 
Japan's attitude toward the historical issues: 
  First, although the war was over for more than half a 
century 
ago, people deeply influenced by militarism still exist in a 
certain number. Such people have an abnormal mentality. They 
are discontented with the current situation and still indulge in 
the memory of the "brilliance of the empire" in history. 
Although they may openly express repentance, when getting tipsy 
they tend to express their true feelings. Nagano was a typical 
case. 
  Second, over a long period of time, Japan regarded its 
historical responsibility as "taboo." It did not dare nor want 
to touch this issue. A history professor said that Japan was 
just trying to evade its responsibility for the war. Only when 
it was facing external pressure and international condemnations 
would it do something perfunctory to free itself from the 
trouble. Some people questioned when Japan would move out of 
the cycle of "cabinet members distorting history--Asian 
countries protesting--the Japanese Government saying sorry and 
the cabinet members resigning." Because Japan cannot face 
history squarely, events hurting the feelings of other Asian 
peoples happened from time to time. This found expression in 
the fact that some war criminals could even become key 
government officials in the 1960's as well as the textbook 
incident in the early 1980's and the incident of the memorial 
ceremony attended by leading government officials in 1985 at 
Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine. 
  Third, some people of insight pointed out: Japan is trying 
to seek an "honorable position" in the world, and the key lies 
in whether it will win the trust of other Asian countries that 
were previously victims of its aggression. The necessary 
precondition for winning such trust is Japan's correct approach 
to its history. It is now the time that Japan should "totally 
repudiate" its past, not only in word but also in action. So 
far, Japan's reflection on the war remains "self-centered." It 
only stresses that Japan itself was the victim of the war, and 
seldom faces squarely the fact that Japan was first of all the 
party that did harm to other Asian nations. Yamasaki, author of 
the film "Home Watching," said that in order to understand the 
feelings of other Asian nations, Japan should show other 
nations' films about the Japanese invasion so that the Japanese 
people may be educated properly. 
  On many occasions, Prime Minister Hata recently expressed 
the 
need to make profound self-criticism of Japan's past. He said 
that Japan should be actually aware of the unbearable pain and 
misery caused by its aggression and colonial rule, should 
correctly approach its past, and should use a correct outlook on 
history to educate the younger generations in order to prevent 
the repetition of the history. This shows the foresight and 
insight of the politicians of the new generation.

  [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- China is to hold 
large-scale investment and trade symposiums early next month 
respectively in Melbourne and Sydney in Australia. 
  During the symposiums, a group of over 100 government 
officials and entrepreneurs from China's 20 provinces and 
municipalities will hold talks with their Australian partners on 
519 investment projects they brought with. 
  An official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that the projects, totalling seven 
billion U.S. dollars, include those of agriculture, 
communications, electronics, building materials, petrochemistry 
and service sectors. 
  The talks will be the largest of its kind China has yet held 
in Australia. 
  The delegation, to be headed by MOFTEC's Vice-Minister Gu 
Yongjiang, will also give Australian entrepreneurs and 
businessmen a systematic introduction on China's current 
economic reform, investment climate, Chinese laws and rules 
concerning the protection of foreign investment, the MOFTEC 
official said. 
  Since 1972 when diplomatic ties were established between 
China and Australia, bilateral trade has seen a constant 
development, the official said. 
  Statistics show that trade volume between China and 
Australia 
in 1993 hit a record high of three billion U.S. dollars, among 
which China's import was 1.94 billion U.S. dollars and its 
export was 1.06 billion U.S. dollars. 
  According to the official, for the sake of its construction, 
China needs to import various raw materials and advanced 
technologies in production, processing, storage and 
transportation of grain, in telecommunications, mining, 
metallurgy as well as in port construction. 
  China spent 485 million U.S. dollars last year importing 
17.06 million tons of iron ore, 440 million U.S. dollars 
importing 130,000 tons of wool and over 100 million U.S. dollars 
importing 1.09 million tons of grain. 
  During the same time, China exported 335 million U.S. 
dollars 
of clothing and 135 million U.S. dollars of textile products to 
Australia, and its export volume of machinery and electronic 
products to Australia reached 243 million U.S. dollars last year. 
  Meanwhile, economic cooperation between the two countries 
has 
also seen marked progress, the official said. 
  By the end of last year, China had set up 134 trade 
institutions and enterprises in Australia with a contractual 
investment totalling 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, among which some 
one-fourth was to be funded by the Chinese side. And Australia 
has become one of the countries China has so far invested most. 
  On the other hand, among all the countries and regions in 
the 
world, Australia is the 9th largest investor in China. By the 
end of 1993, australia had set up 1,310 projects in China with a 
contractual investment of 1.245 billion U.S. dollars, among 
which 338 million U.S. dollars had been actually put into use. 
  Therefore, the MOFTEC official said, Chinese and Australian 
economies are much mutually complementary and the prospect for 
their cooperation is broad. 
  The upcoming symposiums and talks will provide more 
opportunities for further cooperation in industrial and 
commercial circles between the two countries, the official said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Gao Jian (7559 1017) from the United Nations] </F>
  [Text] New York, 24 May (XINHUA) -- In his speech at the 
UN Trusteeship Council, Zhang Yan, Chinese delegate to the 
United Nations, said that China is willing to develop relations 
of friendship and cooperation with Palau after its independence 
on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence -- 
mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual 
non- aggression, non-interference in one another's internal 
affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. 
  The UN Trusteeship Council held its 61st conference today. 
Representatives of the Palau Government and the U.S. 
Administration, the authority in charge of the trust territory, 
announced at the conference that the two countries will carry 
out the Treaty of Free Contacts beginning on 1 October 1994. 
  According to this treaty, Palau will terminate its political 
status as a trust territory of the United States and will become 
an independent sovereign state. 
  Palau President Kunivo Nakamular, who is attending the 
conference, said in his speech that he hopes Palau will take the 
floor at the next UN General Assembly as a sovereign and 
independent state and a member of the United Nations. Zhang Yan 
said the Chinese Government and people always support the people 
of the trust territories in their demands and aspirations for 
national self-determination and independence. 
  He said: The Chinese people have always cherished friendly 
affection toward the people of Palau. We hope that Palau will 
become an independent member of the international community at 
an early date, and that it will embark on the road of developing 
its national economy and building its country. 
  Palau, with a population of approximately 16,000 people, is 
situated in western Pacific and is one of the gateways leading 
to Southeast Asia in the Pacific Ocean. It is currently the 
only territory under UN trusteeship. 
  Palau was occupied by the United States during World War II. 
The United Nations placed it under U.S. trust in 1947. A 
referendum on Palau's future political status and prospects held 
in January 1993 showed that 68.26 percent of the voters were in 
favor of the Treaty of Free Contacts signed between Palau and 
the United States in August 1982, and thus adopted the decision 
to terminate its trustee status by a simple majority.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 25 (XINHUA) -- India and China, the 
two largest Asian nations, have a great potential of trade worth 
over 25 billion U.S. dollars annually, PRESS TRUST OF INDIA was 
quoting a recent report of the Centre for Global Trade 
Development today. 
  The centre, an independent research and information U.S. 
based group monitoring all 220 countries and regions of the 
world, said both China and India have entered into an 
irreversible process of absolute economic progress bringing a 
greater quality of life for its citizens. 
  It said both India and China have great potential in 
exploring the economic exchanges together. 
  So far bilateral trade between the two countries is still 
low, diplomats in the Chinese Embassy said. Their bilateral 
trade in 1993 amounted to 670 million U.S. dollars in India's 
favour. 
  The report said India's present export growing speed of an 
average 20 percent will enable it to reach over 90 billion 
dollars in next six years and the imports are poised to grow at 
an equal speed. 
  It said the Chinese exports, at the present growth rate, 
will 
cross 200 billion U.S. dollar mark in six years, adding that 
when combined with Hong Kong's, the exports will be well over 
425 billion dollars. 
  The bilateral trade will not only create huge and 
unprecedented opportunities for both countries' businesses and 
investors, but also bring about a greater economic and 
geo-political stability in the region, the report said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 24, IRNA--Iranian Ambassador to Beijing 
Mohammad Hoseyn Mir-Fakhr and editor-in-chief of the country's 
English daily CHINA DAILY, Zhu Uing Huang [name as received], 
Tuesday exchanged views on ways of expanding cooperation in the 
news field. 
  Mir-Fakhr welcomed cooperation between the Iranian and 
Chinese press and said this would foil the propaganda launched 
by the western media, which portrays news based on its own 
interests. 
  Zhu said in reply that cooperation between Iranian and 
Chinese news agencies could obviate the influence wielded by 
western news. He added that western news sources never reflect 
positive points regarding the achievements of Iran and China but 
always try to beam negative news about them. 
  Zhu proposed that besides the "new world order" there should 
be a "new news order" in the world. He announced his paper's 
readiness to cooperate with the Iranian press in this regard. 
  The two sides also stressed an exchange of visits between 
editors-in-chief of the two countries' dailies.

  [Text] Lhasa, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The Zham trading post in 
Tibet, the only channel for trade between China and Nepal, has 
been bustling in the past few years, as the annual trade value 
on the Sino-Nepalese border hit 300 million yuan (about 35 
million U.S. dollars) last year. 
  Located at the foot of the southern Himalayas, Zham has 
served as a political, economic and cultural passageway between 
China and Nepal since the Sino-Nepalese highway opened in 1965. 
However, the annual border trade volume was worth only seven 
million yuan (800,000 U.S. dollars) in 1979. 
  Along with China's reform and open policy, Zham has become 
prosperous as hotels, power stations, post offices, banks, and 
industry and commerce offices have sprung up and more business 
people have been flocking there. 
  Now the port boasts 3,000 residents, most of whom are 
businessmen from the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Chinese 
provinces, and Nepal. 
  According to local officials, ten percent of the local trade 
volume is done in U.S. dollars, 30 percent in Nepalese currency 
and 50 percent in renminbi. The rest is barter trade.

  [Text] Damascus, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Communist 
Party delegation headed by Wei Jianxing held talks here today 
with a delegation of the Syrian Arab Ba'th Socialist Party 
headed by 'Abdallah al-Ahmar on cooperation and links between 
the two parties. 
  Wei Jianxing is member of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central Committee and 'Abdallah al-Ahmar is assistant 
secretary-general of the Syrian ruling party. 
  During the talks, the two sides reviewed the development of 
relations between the two parties in light of an agreement 
signed between the two sides in 1991 and highlighted the 
necessity of bolstering their relations. 
  Wei briefed the host on the major achievements China has 
registered since it adopted the policy of reforms and opening to 
the outside world in 1978. 
  He also expounded the Chinese stance toward the Middle East 
issue, stressing a political solution to the issue based on U.N. 
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of 
land for peace. 
  He underlined the necessity of restoring all the occupied 
territories including the Syrian Golan Heights, the necessity of 
restoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and 
ensuring the security and territorial integrity of all the 
states in the region. 
  He voiced China's unswerving support for the Palestinian 
people and the Arab people in their struggle for winning 
independence and reclaiming the occupied land. 
  On his part, 'Abdallah al-Ahmar stressed Syria's principles 
for the establishment of a new society and its stand toward the 
Middle East peace process. 
  He pointed out that the cause behind the stumbling Middle 
East peace process is Israel's stubbornness and refusal to 
comply with the U.N. Security Council Resolutions, especially 
242, 338 and 425, which stipulate its withdrawal from all the 
Arab lands.

exchanges. 
  In order to acquire a better understanding of the German 
economic, cultural, and environmental protection situations, Xie 
Fei and his entourage inspected Frankfort Airport, which is 
currently undergoing extension; travelled on a high-speed 
railroad in a high-speed special train made by Germany's Siemens 
Company; and visited a farm in Bavaria, where they also called 
on the farm owner. 
  During their two-day stay in Denmark, the Guangdong 
provincial economic investigation delegation led by Xie Fei held 
separate talks with Denmark's ministers of agriculture and 
fisheries and foreign affairs and conscientiously conducted 
investigations into Denmark's agricultural production, farm 
products processing, and agricultural management structure. 
  In their talks with people of all walks of life in Germany 
and Denmark, Xie Fei and his entourage fully publicized the 
excellent opportunities in and good prospects for 
Guangdong-Germany and Guangdong-Denmark economic and 
technological cooperation; expressed the hope that both sides 
would make continued efforts to further bilateral cooperation 
and exchanges; and discussed and agreed on with Germany and 
Denmark specific forms of bilateral cooperation as well as a 
number of joint-venture projects.

  [Text] Lisbon, May 24 (XINHUA) -- President of the 
Portuguese Assembly Barbosa De Melo said here today that the 
rapid development of China was of great significance not only to 
China itself but also to the whole world. 
  He made the remarks at a meeting with a visiting Chinese 
delegation headed by vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress (NPC) Wang Guangying. 
  De Melo spoke highly of the great progress China has made in 
recent years in the economic field, particularly in agriculture. 
  Both sides expressed satisfaction with bilateral relations 
and with their cooperation concerning Macao. 
  Macao is now enjoying a period of smooth transition thanks 
to 
the Sino-Portuguese joint declaration on Macao, and people are 
confident about its future, said De Melo. 
  The cooperation between China and Portugal on Macao should 
be 
viewed as an example in solving outstanding problems through 
cooperation between countries, said Wang. 
  At a separate meeting the same day, the Chinese delegation 
held talks with the economic, financial and planning committee 
of the Portuguese assembly on strengthening cooperation between 
the two parliaments.

<F P=106> [By Li Han (4539 2487): "CPC Steps up Infiltration Into </F>
Foreign-Funded Enterprises"] 
  [Text] At the end of last year, the Secretariat of the CPC 
Central Committee approved the transmission of a findings report 
submitted to it by the Organization Department of the CPC 
Central Committee, which was entitled "The Party's Political 
Leadership Over Foreign-Funded [wai zi 1120 6327] Enterprises 
Must be Speedily Strengthened." The document urged localities 
and management departments of foreign-funded enterprises at all 
levels to complete, within a specific time, the work of forming 
basic-level party organizations in foreign-funded enterprises, 
in particular, wholly foreign-owned [wai shang du zi 1120 0794 
3747 6327] enterprises, and ordered them to take measures to 
ensure party membership among the employees of wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises. 
<H5>  It is Difficult to Form Party Organizations in Wholly </H5>
Foreign Owned Enterprises 
  The findings report of the Organization Department, which 
was 
approved and transmitted by the Secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee with a note, states: In recent years, the Central 
Committee has repeatedly transmitted to lower levels special 
documents complete with several specific requirements on how to 
strengthen the building of party organizations in 
foreign-invested [san zi 0005 6327] enterprises. Before and 
after the party's 14th National Congress, several principal 
central leading comrades specially made clear instructions on 
the issue. In terms of their implementation, so long as the 
local party organizational departments and the party 
organizations in the foreign-funded enterprises management 
departments attach adequate importance to the issue, the 
formation of basic-level party organizations in Sino-foreign 
cooperative and joint-venture enterprises will progress quite 
smoothly, and in some of them, the basic-level organizations of 
the Chinese Youth League have been set up or revived. A 
considerable number of newly formed, revived, or strengthened 
basic-level party organizations in Sino-foreign cooperative and 
joint-venture enterprises have begun conducting normal 
organizational activities and organized their members to play a 
relatively good role in political leadership. However, in 
wholly foreign-owned enterprises (including enterprises wholly 
owned by Hong Kong and Taiwan businessmen, the same below), the 
building of basic-level party organizations has been all along 
seriously hampered. According to the statistics provided by the 
foreign-funded enterprise management departments from 16 large 
and mid-sized cities throughout the country, including the three 
municipalities directly under the central government, by October 
this year (1993), approximately 70 percent of the wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises had not yet even had party groups set 
up. 
<H5>  Foreign Businessmen Resist the Communist Party's </H5>
Infiltration Into Employees Ranks 
  After gathering the reports from various localities, the 
survey personnel of the Central Organization Department held 
that the reasons behind this state of affairs were as follows: 
  1. In Sino-foreign cooperative or joint-venture enterprises, 
in particular in such enterprises based on former state-owned 
enterprises as the Chinese side, among the legal-person 
representatives and managerial personnel of the Chinese side 
there is a certain proportion of Communist Party members. After 
enterprise merging, among the former staff members and workers 
of the cooperative enterprises there are still more or fewer 
party members. However, in the wholly owned enterprises of the 
foreign side, there is no Chinese representation at all. Of the 
employees newly recruited by the enterprises of this type after 
having themselves registered and starting operation, the 
proportion of party members was very meager, and many did not 
even employ any party members at all. In the absence of party 
members, building basic-level party organizations is out of the 
question. 
  2. When recruiting employees, the bosses of foreign-funded 
enterprises make every effort to prevent the Communist Party 
members from "penetrating" the ranks of employees by using 
various means and excuses, erecting barriers in depth, and 
setting up defenses at every step. In an extreme case, when a 
foreign businessman found out that there were Communist Party 
members among his employees, he dismissed them by inventing all 
sorts of excuses. 
  3. When recommending employees to management, foreign-funded 
enterprise management departments in various localities do not 
give full consideration in advance to the proportion of party 
members in the name lists of their candidates. Some of them 
even refuse to recommend party members to work in wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises in compliance with management's 
unreasonable demands. 
  The Central Organization Department has received reports 
from such cities as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and Kunming 
which showed that the problems revealed were extremely serious 
and even had reached intolerable proportions. 
  For example, in order to smoothly get a job in wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises, some Communist Party members went so 
far as to go through quit-the-party procedures with their work 
units beforehand; some local foreign-funded enterprise 
management departments asked party-member candidates recommended 
to work in foreign-funded enterprises to withhold their party 
membership from management; when recommending technicians to 
management, apart from putting in a good word for them about 
their professional competence and moral quality, some 
foreign-funded enterprise management departments went so far as 
to specially announce that these people "are not members of the 
CPC"; and moreover, when recruiting employees for wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises, some foreign-funded enterprise 
management departments openly professed that "party members are 
not to be employed" and "no consideration will be given to 
members of the CPC." 
<H5>  The Organizations of the CPC are Underground Party </H5>
Organizations in Foreign-Funded Enterprises 
  The findings report says: Because of the reasons mentioned 
above, there is no way to build basic-level party organizations 
in most wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and it is very 
difficult for basic-level party organizations which are already 
set up in such enterprises to carry out their normal activities. 
In the last two years, the Central Organization Department has 
received letters from some party members working in wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises, reporting that once their membership 
in the Communist Party was exposed, this meant endless trouble 
for them. Therefore, in their letters they asked if the party 
and government had any official documents and decrees or laws 
and regulations to ensure that Communist Party members are not 
discriminated against and their organizational activities are 
"legalized" in foreign-funded enterprises. 
  In a letter to the Central Organization Department, a 
Communist Party member who worked in a foreign-funded enterprise 
said grumblingly: After working in foreign-funded enterprises, 
innumerable obstacles were put up and discrimination was applied 
against us just because we were Communist Party members. This 
made us naturally associate with the difficulties, hardships, 
and risks which underground party organizations encountered and 
endured in the party's history of struggle while working in the 
"enemy-occupied areas." 
  The "note" attached by the Secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee to the findings report states: In the territory of 
the People's Republic of China where the Communist Party is a 
ruling party, it is right and proper for the Communist Party to 
set up organizations at the basic level and its members to carry 
out their organizational activities. However, in foreign-funded 
enterprises, unexpectedly there was the problem of whether the 
Communist Party is "legal" or not, and also unexpectedly, 
Communist Party members working in such enterprises poured out 
their demand to higher organizations and even the central 
organization of the party that they "hope to become just and 
honorable Communist Party members." This cannot but attract the 
great attention of the Party Central Committee and local 
organizations at all levels. 
<H5>  Party Organizations Should Be Set Up in Foreign-Funded </H5>
Enterprises Within a Specific Time 
  According to the findings report, the plan worked out by the 
Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee to 
"complete the work of building basic-level party organizations 
in all foreign-funded enterprises within the specific time" was 
approved by the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee. 
  The plan stipulates, in principle, that party committees of 
various localities should strengthen political leadership and 
offer better work guidance to basic-level party organizations in 
wholly foreign-owned enterprises which hire more than 100 
employees in our country and ensure that the party organizations 
can carry out their normal activities on schedule so that they 
will be genuinely able to play the role of a fighting force. As 
far as such enterprises where no basic-level party organization 
have been set up so far are concerned, the local foreign-funded 
enterprise departments in charge of the enterprises must set 
about to find out the real political conditions of enterprise 
employees, and if there are already three or more party members 
in their ranks, urge them to set up a party group or branch as 
quickly as possible and carry out organizational activities on 
time. In an enterprise whose party membership is large enough to 
set up several party branches, a general party branch or a 
higher party working committee should be correspondingly set up 
to give unified leadership to the party branches. 
  What remedial measures should be adopted in the days to come 
to deal with the case in which a foreign-funded enterprise's 
employee ranks, there are just one or two or not any party 
members? The Central Committee is studying ways to solve the 
problem. 
<H5>  Trade Unions in Foreign-Funded Enterprises Must be Put Under </H5>
the Leadership of the Communist Party 
  The instruction of the Secretariat of the CPC Central 
Committee also states: The emergence of this new 
thing--foreign-invested enterprises--has really brought enormous 
results to China's economy. Nevertheless, as the number of such 
enterprises is increasingly expanding, the resulting problems 
cannot but attract the great attention of our party and 
government. 
  At present the most pronounced problem with foreign-invested 
enterprises is the contradiction between management and labor. 
In some enterprises, disregarding China's laws, regulations, 
and decrees, some management personnel encroached upon the 
employees' legitimate rights and interests as they liked and 
even ignored the safety of the latter's lives. Therefore, the 
party, the government, and the Chinese employees in 
foreign-invested enterprises must have a full understanding of 
the importance and urgency of setting up trade union 
organizations in foreign-invested enterprises. 
  However, like the trade union organizations in state-owned 
enterprises, the trade unions in foreign-invested enterprises 
must be put strictly under party leadership. In a 
foreign-invested enterprise, in particular a wholly 
foreign-owned enterprise, where there is no basic-level party 
organization and not even a single party member among the 
Chinese employees, how does the trade union, once established in 
such enterprise, accept party leadership? 
  Before the transmission of a new relevant document by the 
Central Committee, the organization departments of party 
committees of various localities and the party working 
committees of foreign-funded enterprise management departments 
should adopt some positive remedial measures with regard to the 
foreign-funded enterprises where no party members are found in 
employee ranks. 
  According to statistics, in all Sino-foreign cooperative and 
joint-venture enterprises, cases in which there are no party 
members in the Chinese management personnel and employees are 
very rare. It is relatively easier to solve this 
problem--sending party members to go in. However, this method 
of forcibly sending party members to go in should not be adopted 
in regard to the wholly foreign-owned enterprises where there 
are no party members among the Chinese management personnel and 
employees hired. The relatively stable and safe method to take 
is for the party working committees of foreign-funded enterprise 
management departments to lead their subordinate personnel 
management institutions to look for a number of candidates who 
are professionally competent and trusted by management in their 
work and give them guidance so that they will actively make 
progress politically, and promptly admit them into the party as 
conditions are ripe. 
<H5>  Foreign Businessmen Should Be Prevented From "Illegal" </H5>
Hiring of Labor 
  While approving the transmission of the findings report of 
the Central Organization Department, the Secretariat of the CPC 
Central Committee stated: Seeing the very grim situation 
recently in which in the course of their formation and 
operations, foreign-invested enterprises, in particular wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises, hired "illegal [hei 7815] employees" 
without permission by bypassing our relevant management 
institutions, thus causing a direct drop in the proportion of 
party members in foreign-funded enterprises' employee ranks, the 
Central Secretariat has suggested that the government take some 
practical and effective measures to prevent the abovementioned 
phenomenon from continuing to spread. The specific methods to 
be taken are that relevant government departments formulate 
clear laws and regulations and give appropriate punishment to 
the foreign-funded enterprises which hired "illegal employees" 
without the permission of our management institutions, personnel 
management fees collected from foreign-funded enterprises by 
management departments should be reduced appropriately, and a 
stipulation should be made that while recommending qualified 
people to foreign-funded enterprises, management departments 
should ensure high quality to win trustworthiness. 
  The Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee maintained: So 
long as the phenomenon in which foreign-funded enterprise hire 
"illegal employees" from among unemployed persons in society is 
checked and the employees of wholly foreign-owned enterprises 
are all recruited through the recommendation of the Chinese 
side, it will be possible to ensure that Communist Party members 
will make up a certain portion of employees of these enterprises.

<F P=106> [By reporter Qu Zhihong (2575 1807 4767)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- On the 52nd anniversary 
of the delivery of "Mao Zedong's talks at the Yanan Forum on 
Literature and Art," the Press and Publication Administration 
invited some Beijing writers, scholars, and personages from the 
publication sector to a discussion centered around the theme of 
"Inspiring People With Works of Excellence." Participants 
reviewed the spirit of Mao Zedong's "talks," and explored ways 
in which to carry out the task of "inspiring people with works 
of excellence," which was proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin. They 
also suggested ways and means for improving publication-related 
work. 
  Yu Youxian, director of the Press and Publication 
Administration, said at the meeting: Although different eras 
have different requirements on the contents of works of 
excellence, the orientation of "serving the people and 
socialism" pointed out to literary and art workers by Comrade 
Mao Zedong more than half a century ago, and the principle of 
"letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of 
thought contend" later proposed by him, still form the basic 
demand we set on the production of intellectual products today, 
as well as an important guarantee for promoting a flourishing 
publication industry. Yu Youxian said: Large numbers of good, 
widely-circulated books were produced during each of the 
historical periods following the founding of New China. These 
works played a huge and irreplaceable role in elevating the 
masses' realm of thought, in inspiring the masses to unite and 
struggle, in promoting social progress, and in promoting reform 
and opening up. Yu Youxian said: As a publication 
administration organ, we consider it our main task to vigorously 
organize the publication, promotion, and distribution of 
excellent books. 
  Participants of the meeting stated their views on the 
current 
book markets, which face many problems. Dong Xiuyu [5516 4423 
3768], editor-in-chief of the Joint Publishing Company, said: I 
often came across things which were in a mess but still put on 
display in public when I browsed in bookstores on the streets. 
As a member of the publication work force, I feel very uneasy 
about this. We should produce more and better works of 
excellence to corner markets and to satisfy the needs of the 
broad masses of people. These are the responsibility and duty we 
must face. 
  Ren Jiyu, curator of the National Library, believed that we 
should pay special attention to young people in our creative 
undertakings and publications. Nowadays, young students know 
very little about the cultural and historical figures of their 
country, but the future of our country and people rests on them. 
We will face very serious consequences if we fail to solve this 
problem.

<F P=106> [By reporter Jia Fenyong (6328 1164 0516)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- The National Work 
Conference on Educating and Training Court Cadres opened today 
in Beijing. Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Secretariat and president of the Supreme People's Court, spoke 
at the meeting, stressing the need to step up efforts to raise 
court cadres' academic levels and to train a number of 
professional judges. 
  Ren Jianxin said that since the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee and with the development of reform, 
opening up, and of the building of the socialist legal system, 
courts have made great progress in strengthening the rank of 
court cadres and achieved marked results in educating and 
training court cadres. Work on multi-level education and 
training of court cadres was comprehensively carried out 
particularly since the establishment of the Sparetime Law 
University for the nation's court cadres in 1985, of the China 
Senior Judge Training Center, and of provincial-level judge 
training centers in 1988. Now China has basically realized the 
goal of raising court cadres' professional levels to the college 
law department level or higher, of having trained more than 600 
holders of master's degrees in law and over 1,000 senior judges 
and reserve forces for senior judges, and sent a number of court 
cadres to make further studies abroad. The decade-long efforts 
of educating and training court cadres have greatly changed the 
phenomenon of low educational and professional levels among 
court cadres due to historical reasons and helped courts raise 
the quality of and efficiency in handling cases. 
  Ren Jianxin said the gradual establishment of a socialist 
market economic system and of a legal system that is adapted to 
the socialist market economic system have markedly increased 
courts' roles and responsibilities. This sets greater demands 
on court cadres. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a 
sound and regularized judge training system and to train judges 
in a planned and systematic manner. It is also necessary to 
establish a state institute for judges. Provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities should step up establishing 
institutes for judges in their localities. Only through this 
way can we meet the requirements for and improve China's 
modernized judge system. 
  Vice President of the Supreme People's Court Zhu Mingshan 
said at the meeting that courts will provide a complete pre-post 
training for their 42,000 new members in the next several years, 
will sponsor special seminars on new laws in a timely manner, 
and will regularly hold training classes for judges, so as to 
constantly raise court cadres' quality and academic levels. 
  The current national work conference on educating and 
training court cadres was the second meeting following the first 
meeting, which was held in 1990. Some 100 leaders from all of 
the nation's levels of courts and from relevant departments 
attended the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- Wang Zhaoguo, director 
of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central 
Committee, met here with a delegation from the federation of 
textile-related guilds of Hong Kong this afternoon. 
  The group, consisting of more than 20 members, including 
(Tang Jiqian), (Chen Ruiqiu) and (Fang Keng), arrived in Beijing 
on 24 May. Wang Zhaoguo welcomed the representatives of Hong 
Kong's textile trades. He thanked people of Hong Kong's 
textile-related trades for joining their mainland counterparts 
in working hard for economic development during China's reform 
and opening up period. He also thanked people of Hong Kong's 
industrial and business circles for their work in the 
development of education and public welfare on the mainland. 
  The federation of textile-related trades of Hong Kong, set 
up 
in 1989 and composed of textile, dyeing, garment, and eight 
other guilds, represents Hong Kong's textile and garment 
industries. It is one of the largest industrial organizations 
in Hong Kong. The federation's board of directors is composed 
of well-known industrialists and businessmen of Hong Kong. Most 
of the members of the federation have invested in running 
factories on the mainland. The current visit by the delegation 
is for the purpose of enabling Hong Kong's textile and garment 
industries to increase contacts with the relevant central 
departments, know more about the situation of reform and opening 
up on the mainland, and expand relations and cooperation with 
the mainland. During their stay in Beijing, the members of the 
delegation will pay courtesy calls on the responsible persons of 
the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, the 
United Front Work Department, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation, the Ministry of Internal Trade, the China 
Textile Council, and other departments concerned. 
  Wang Zhaoguo said during the meeting: Over the last decade 
since the start of reform and opening up, China has made 
tremendous economic progress, with a rapid increase in 
investment by people from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. With 
the economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and the 
mainland becoming closer and closer, Hong Kong and the mainland 
have been economically linked together, complementing each other 
and working for a common prosperity. 
  Wang Zhaoguo exchanged views with the representatives of 
Hong 
Kong's textile and garment industries on questions of concern, 
such as how to work more for Hong Kong's economic prosperity and 
smooth transition.

<F P=106> ["Legal System Forum" column by Yang Haikun (2799 3189 </F>
0981): "Beat the Drums To Clear the Way for `Judicial 
Independence'"] 
  [Text] As we march toward the 21st century, the objective 
of China's economic structural reform is to establish a 
socialist market economic structure, and in keeping with this 
goal, the objective of its political structural reform is to 
build a socialist democratic country with a legal system under 
the leadership of the CPC. 
  The two crucial points concerning the construction of a 
socialist democratic country with a legal system are the 
necessity of placing the law in a supreme position and that of 
realizing judicial independence. Placing the law in a supreme 
position conforms to the principle of China's Constitution. The 
Constitution of the PRC provides: "The state upholds the 
uniformity and dignity of the socialist legal system. All state 
organs, the armed forces, all political parties and public 
organizations, and all enterprises and undertakings must abide 
by the Constitution and the law. All acts in violation of the 
Constitution and the law must be looked into." The Constitution 
and law were formulated by the people, which are the 
concentrated expression of the people's interests and will. 
Therefore, regarding the Constitution and law as supreme means 
regarding the interests and will of the people as supreme. 
Without the supremacy of law, it is impossible to uphold the 
principle that all men are equal before the law. How can people 
talk about all men being equal before the law if certain 
individuals or organizations are able to place themselves above 
the law? 
  Since the objective of establishing a socialist market 
economic structure was defined, China's economic legislation has 
been promulgated very rapidly, and its achievements have been 
obvious to all. At present, however, a very universal and 
urgent issue is how to practice the law in real life situations, 
that is, how to ensure that there is the law to abide by, that 
the law is strictly enforced, and that acts in violation of the 
law are looked into. The most vital point among these is the 
realization of judicial independence. It can be stated that, in 
the political systems of most countries in the contemporary 
world, it is a universally accepted principle that the judicial 
department and its affiliated organizations with courts at their 
center are placed in an independent status. In particular, in 
the power structure of those countries practicing a market 
economy, the independence of the judiciary is of paramount 
importance to stabilizing public order and developing the 
national economy. During his recent visit to China, the 
Argentine justice minister told Chinese reporters: "There are 
many laws in Argentina, but our Constitution is most important 
of all. A major characteristic of the Argentine judicial 
department is its independence. Under no circumstances can a 
president of the republic exercise judicial powers, 
presumptuously make judgments on unsettled cases, or retry 
concluded cases. No one can dismiss a staff member of a 
judicial department if his actions are not censurable, but he 
will be removed from office if he violates the law and 
discipline or commits any ordinary crime." In my view, this is 
the most simple and profound way of summarizing judicial 
independence. In emulating the foreign judicial system, both 
the advanced experience of the developed countries and the 
useful experience of the Third World are worth emulating. Can 
we not obtain any valuable enlightenment from the principle and 
spirit of judicial independence in Argentina? 
  Doctor Ople [ou pu le 2962 2528 0519], who has conducted 
in-depth research on the Japanese judicial system, has pointed 
out: "The intensified authority of judicial departments, the 
enhanced reputation of judges, and the entire independence in 
organization and function based on the above are particularly 
important to a country in which administrative power holds a 
predominant position." According to a survey, great changes have 
taken place in the scope and structure of the cases accepted by 
the people's courts at all levels in China over the past few 
years. Civil and economic disputes as well as maritime and 
business cases directly accepted by the courts have increased 
noticeably. However, there are still many factors that have 
seriously affected fair trials and the strict execution of 
judgments and, in particular, the rate of accepting 
administration-related cases has declined by a large margin. An 
analysis shows that the principal causes are: People dare not 
bring charges before a court for fear that they will suffer 
retaliation; some administrative organs will not answer charges 
due to their poor legal awareness; some judicial personnel dare 
not try cases for fear that their relations with the 
administrative organs will be damaged, or they make judgments 
that pervert the law because they cannot resist the intervention 
from the administrative organs. Practice has proven that, 
without judicial independence, it is very difficult to have laws 
-- even the best ones -- effectively enforced. A judicial 
officer from a grass-roots court sighed with feeling, saying: 
"The courts have become the executive bodies of the government 
organs. As judicial and administrative powers are pulled 
together to jointly deal with people who have no connection with 
the administration, how can there be a procedural system for 
taking action against the administration?" 
  Therefore, in the course of rectifying and punishing 
corruption and establishing a socialist market economic system, 
nothing is more urgent and practical than the establishment of 
an independent judicial structure. It is neither strange nor 
terrible to discover that some corrupt phenomena exist in the 
economic and noneconomic spheres, but it is our inability to use 
powerful means to avoid the abuse of power and maintain a sound 
social and economic order that is really dreadful. Judicial 
fairness is generally regarded as the ultimate and most 
effective means of achieving social justice, so, if judicial 
independence and fairness are not guaranteed and if even the 
courts, procuratorates, and the lawyer system -- which has just 
been established -- are polluted and lack popular trust, then, 
it is merely empty talk when we claim to set up a fair and 
competitive socialist market economic order.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- A working meeting for 
implementing the Children Development Program in China for 1990s 
opened here today, a few days before the International 
Children's Day. 
  Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central 
Committee, along with Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, Vice-Chairwoman 
Chen Muhua of the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress, and Director Peng Peiyun of the Women and Children's 
Working Committee under the State Council, met with participants 
to the meeting. 
  During the meeting 40 individuals, and 77 cities and 
counties 
were awarded for their outstanding work in promoting children's 
well-being. 
  Hu extended holiday greetings to children of different 
nationalities as well as regards to teachers, parents and people 
of various circles who work for children's interests. 
  Calling children the future and hope of the Chinese nation, 
Hu said their healthy growth concerns the fate of the country. 
  Development of children's cause and the raising of a new 
generation represents a basic project for the improvement of the 
nation and an important guarantee for realizing its goal of 
modernization. 
  Drafting of the children development program in China for 
1990s, which is intended to cater to the new situation, is a big 
event and a major step taken by the government to promote 
children's cause in China, he said. 
  He urged party and government officials at various levels to 
fully understand the importance of children's cause, which he 
said needs to be put on their working agenda. 
  Also, he called on different departments and localities to 
adopt effective measures in the light of local conditions to 
implement the program.

<F P=106> [Article by Chen Feng (7115 7364): "Tendency Toward </F>
Boastfulness and Exaggeration Is Sweeping Across the Mainland "] 
  [Text] The "tendency of boastfulness and exaggeration" is 
an intrinsic characteristic of the Communist Party of China; 
however, boastfulness and exaggeration is the "formidable enemy" 
of statistics. The communists declare themselves to be the 
disciple of Lenin who once said that "statistics is a weapon to 
understand society." Since this is so, it should be regarded as 
a field of science which permits no "dishonesty, boastfulness, 
or exaggeration." Communist governments at different levels 
have all set up statistical departments--statistical 
bureaus--and they now also periodically make the statistical 
figures known to the public, but God knows whether these figures 
are reliable or not. For instance, the inflation rates 
published by the statistical departments of the communists are 
extremely unreliable. They said that last year's inflation rate 
on the mainland was ten-odd percent, but the actual feeling of 
common people is that it is far more than that. As they went to 
the market for necessities every day, they know best how much 
prices have soared. 
<H5>  Boastfulness and Exaggeration in the Statistical Work </H5>
  It is unfair to say that the communist authorities know 
nothing about this unreliability of their statistics. In his 
report entitled "Statistics Is a Key Link in the Economic 
Construction," delivered to a national conference on statistical 
work held on February 23 this year, Zou Jiahua, vice premier of 
the State Council, acknowledged boastfulness and exaggeration in 
current statistical work, which could be rather serious in 
certain departments and localities. Some people talk big and 
indulge in empty talk, while others submit false information and 
publish imaginary figures; but they are pleased with themselves. 
It is a manifestation of corruption in the party's working 
style. Mr Zou said that the reasons for fraud and deception in 
the statistical work were as follows: 
  1) The relevant departments and their leaders in the Central 
Committee fail to have a solid grasp of and control over this 
work and neglect authenticity in statistical work and hence 
should be liable for this tendency. 
  2) There exist problems in the guiding ideology of local 
competent authorities with respect to their statistical work. 
  3) The influence of party working style and social 
tendencies. 
  4) A strict system and rational and effective rules and 
regulations for statistical work have been erroneously abandoned 
and violated. 
  5) Bureaucracy in certain administrative and supervisory 
authorities leads to failure in work, and 
  6) No importance has been attached to the solution of the 
problems that cropped up in the process of construction, opening 
up, and economic reform to bring back the working style of 
faithfulness and practicality. 
  Also at this national conference of statistical work, Lu 
Peijian, commissioner of the Central Auditing Department, made 
known the following results of sampling and investigation 
concerning taxation and statistics conducted in the last quarter 
of last year and January this year by various provinces, 
localities and enterprises: -- Considerable discrepancies 
exist between the growth of the national economy and the actual 
fulfillment of various production targets as reported by 
governments of the eight provinces and autonomous regions and 
the 20 major prefectures and cities, with some discrepancies as 
high as 25 percent, -- As many as 12 provinces and autonomous 
regional and 20 major prefectures and cities failed to suspend 
or reduce the scale and progress of capital construction as they 
reported to the central government, -- Inconsistency exists 
between the actual quantity, scale, and capital availability of 
the joint ventures of 12 provinces or autonomous regions and 28 
prefectures or cities and the figures contained in the 
statements submitted by such joint ventures, -- Inflation rate 
of the nine provinces or autonomous regions is five to eight 
percent higher than the real figures they submitted to the State 
Council, and -- Of the total production value of national 
economy in 1993 as submitted by the ten provincial and 
autonomous regional and the 25 prefectural or municipal 
governments, 3 to 12 percent are imaginary numbers. 
<H5>  "What the Superiors Are Fond of, The Subordinates Will Be </H5>
Addicted To" 
  Although the authorities of the CPC have perceived the 
boastfulness and exaggeration with respect to statistics 
submitted by their subordinates, suffered from the "tendency of 
boastfulness and exaggeration" and are eager to correct this 
tendency, the trouble still exists that up till now there are 
still no effective countermeasures. It is a result of "being 
hard to change the original nature" of the "tendency of 
boastfulness and exaggeration." As the old saying goes in a 
Chinese history book, "What the superiors are fond of, the 
subordinates will be addicted to". Where the superiors are 
happy with success, the subordinates will of course report only 
their achievements rather than their setbacks, let alone the 
fact that the superiors often appraise the work of their 
subordinates on the basis of the so-called achievements reported 
by the latter.

<F P=106> [By Ding Yajun (0002 0068 6511): "First-Quarter Crime </F>
Figures Up; Public Security Organs Step up Crackdown"] 
  [Text] Crime was on the rise across the nation in the 
first quarter of this year. Public security organs recorded 
approximately 300,000 criminal cases, up 9.2 percent from the 
same period last year, and close to 120,000 were serious, up 
23.1 percent from the same period last year. The authorities 
smashed 28,031 criminal gangs boasting 105,582 members, which 
were respectively 9 percent and 7.8 percent higher than the 
numbers recorded in the same period last year; the gangs were 
responsible for 1.4 billion yuan in property losses, up 42.9 
percent over the same period last year. 
  Robbery remained one of the most serious crimes. There were 
a total of 30,316 robberies in the first quarter, up 9.8 percent 
over the same period last year; 20,709, or 46.4 percent, were 
serious, which was 19.5 percent higher than the figure in the 
same period last year. There were 1,694 robberies involving 
over 10,000 yuan each, and 290 over 100,000 yuan each, both an 
increase over last year. 
  "Highway and train robberies" were on the rise again in some 
localities. Robberies on highways, railways, and other means of 
transportation in the first quarter totalled 9,100, almost as 
many as in the same period last year. In areas in Guangdong, 
Sichuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Jilin, highway and train 
robberies occurred earlier than they did last year. There were 
52 train robberies in Zhejiang in February, up 73.3 percent from 
the same period last year. 
  In economically advanced areas, there were more kidnappings, 
with criminals abducting people for ransom. 
  Murders and assaults greatly undermined the people's sense 
of 
security. The first quarter recorded 6,196 murders, up 8.9 
percent from the same period last year. Of these murders, those 
motivated by personal disagreements and disputes accounted for 
the greatest number. 
  Assaults rose continually, with 12,285 such cases reported 
in 
the first quarter, up 5.4 percent from the same period last year. 
  Thefts rose even faster. The first quarter saw 211,473 theft 
cases, up 8.8 percent from the same period last year, of which 
70,746 were serious, representing a 28.3 percent rise. Car 
thefts and safe burglaries accounted for a large percentage of 
crime and respectively rose 54.1 percent and 47.6 percent. 
Banks and other financial institutions remained prime targets 
for criminals. Crimes against financial institutions in the 
first quarter numbered 470, 59 more than the figure recorded in 
the same period last year. Since early this year there have 
been five bank holdups, each of them involving more than 200,000 
yuan. The cases were all perpetrated by workers of the banks 
and resulted in losses of approximately 7 million yuan. 
  Serious fraud and forgeries rose considerably, and cigarette 
smuggling was on the rise again. There were 7,700 fraud cases 
in the first quarter, up 16.3 percent from the same period last 
year, of which 4,493 were serious, 31.5 percent higher than the 
same period last year. Fraud cases involving 100,000 yuan 
numbered 632, up 80 percent. Some criminals defrauded banks 
with massive check overdrafts. Some even set up banks 
themselves and later absconded with huge amounts of savings in 
cash. There were a total of 797 cases of forged money reported, 
up 77.1 percent from last year. Public security organs across 
the country seized millions of yuan worth of forged money in the 
first quarter. 
  On the whole, smuggling dropped, with 187 cases reported in 
the first quarter, down 17.6 percent from the same period last 
year. However, following the ban by the State Tobacco Bureau on 
imported cigarettes, there have been a spate of extraordinary 
foreign- igarette smuggling cases. Wuxi City in Jiangsu, 
smashed a 10-strong cigarette-smuggling ring and seized 954 
cartons of contraband cigarettes. 
  Gun and drug trafficking remained serious in the southwest 
border regions. Public securities in the region solved a series 
of drug cases involving over 10 kg of drugs. 
  Public security organs across the country are deepening and 
extending the struggle against various crimes, are strengthening 
investigative efforts, and are working hard to curb the rise of 
crime to ensure stability and public order in the spring and 
summer.

<F P=106> [By Xiao He: "State to Expand Post-Doctoral Work"] </F>
  [Text] China plans to expand the enrolment of 
post-doctoral scholars to train more young talent for the 
country's long-term development. 
  The move, covering the social and natural sciences, aims to 
raise the number in post-doctoral programmes from 1,500 to 3,000 
by the year 2000, said Cheng Lianzhang, the Vice-Minister of 
Personnel. 
  In January, the government raised annual funding for 
post-doctoral scholars from 15,000 yuan ($1,700) to 20,000 yuan 
($2,300). 
  Last year 728 post-doctoral scholars were recruited by 
almost 
300 work stations in 165 higher-education and research 
institutes nationwide. 
  Enrolment of such scholars has increased 27 percent annually 
since 1988, according to the Ministry of Personnel. 
  The increase shows the importance the State pays to the work 
of post-doctoral scholars, Cheng said. 
  The fund covers the salary and preliminary research 
expenditures of scholars, who usually undertake two to three 
research projects, including key State undertakings, during 
their two-year training. 
  While enterprises and public organizations are donating more 
money to post-doctoral projects, government funds have increased 
by 30 per cent annually. 
  Since the post-doctoral system was introduced in 1985, China 
has poured 115.56 million yuan ($13.34 million) to support 
research. 
  And more than 1,300 post-doctoral scholars have come out of 
the two-year training programmes at the stations. 
  Most of them have been employed as senior researchers and 32 
became tutors for doctorate students, said Zhang Xiaowen. Vice 
Minister of the State Education Commission.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The Party School of the 
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee today announced the 
establishment of a research center for studying the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Addressing the ceremony to launch the center, Party School 
President Hu Jintao, a standing committee member of the 
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said Deng 
Xiaoping's theory for building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the guiding principle for China's reform, 
opening-up and modernization drive. 
  The CPC party school, as a special institution for training 
party officials and theorists, is duty-bound to study and 
propagate Deng Xiaoping's theory, Hu said, urging the school to 
bring its advantages into full play and build itself into "a 
base for research" in this regard. 
  Also, he called on researchers to study new issues, come 
with 
fresh and correct views, by adhering to the principle of seeking 
truth from facts and emancipating the mind, so as to ensure a 
democratic and lively academic atmosphere. 
  Gong Yuzhi, deputy president of the party school was 
appointed head of the research center.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--A few days 
ago, China's National Narcotics Control Commission, a Ministry 
of Public Health, and the National Medicine and Drug 
Administration issued a "Circular on Strengthening the Control 
of Natural Caffeine," calling on the public security organs in 
all localities to strictly cope with such illegal and criminal 
activities. The National Narcotics Control Commission has 
instructed departments in charge to adopt measures to strengthen 
caffeine control. 
  The circular says: Since last year, some localities have 
begun producing natural caffeine in the pretext of pooling funds 
with others or exporting it. Some have not made declarations in 
accordance with the law. Some even have illegally produced, 
sold, and advertised their products without the approval of 
public health, medicine, and drug control departments. These 
acts have interfered with social order and harmed the health of 
the people. Some have constituted crimes. 
  The circular calls on all localities to ban the illegal and 
criminal acts of producing and dealing in natural caffeine 
without approval. It says that those violating the law will be 
held accountable for their criminal acts by judicial organs in 
accordance with the law, and that the act of illegally 
producing, selling, importing, or exporting natural caffeine 
will be punished as the crime of smuggling, selling, 
transporting, or manufacturing drugs in accordance with the 
provisions of the NPC Standing Committee's "Decision on 
Narcotics Control."

<F P=106> [By reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474)] </F>
  [Text] Tianjin, 23 May (XINHUA) -- China attaches 
importance to technological development, technological imports, 
and technological transformation, and to the constant increase 
in investments in those areas, and to markedly increasing the 
percentage of domestic-made equipment, so they will play a 
greater role in economic construction. Today, Xu Penghang, 
State Economic Restructuring Commission vice minister, made the 
above remarks. 
  Ten years ago, China set the strategic goal of manufacturing 
major technological equipment at home, and in line with the 
state long-term development plan, decided on 15 special research 
projects centering on energy, transportation, raw material 
sectors including complete technological equipment for large 
open-cut coal mining, large-scale thermal power stations, an 
ultra high tension power transmission and transformation 
project, the Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex's second stage 
project, large chemical fertilizer plants, a 300,000-tonne 
ethylene plant, the Daqin Railway, and desert oil drilling. 
Because the state attaches importance to these projects, great 
cooperation among relevant departments, provinces, and 
municipalities; joint efforts by thousands of enterprises, 
institutions, and by hundreds and thousands of scientific and 
technological personnel; and through the integration of 
technology and trade and through importing and assimilating 
technologies, China has gradually mastered the key technologies 
and built production bases for a number of major technological 
equipment. 
  So far, 40 complete sets of major technological equipment 
have been completed, commissioned, and applied in some 50 key 
construction and technological transformation projects. For 
instance, Beijing's electron-positron collider has been 
operating smoothly and reliably over the last several years, has 
been highly evaluated by international high-energy physics 
circles, and has been made public to the outside world. A 
complete set of single bucket-wheel excavator technology for 
open-cut mining, capable of producing 10 million tonne output 
annually, has been promoted at the Nanfeng Iron Mine and 
Huolinhe Coal Mine and was exported to Pakistan, where it was 
well received. Both the electron-positron collider and the 
single-bucket wheel excavator technology won the State 
Scientific and Technological Progress Prizes. Through 
technological imports and joint ventures, large capacity 
generators for thermal power stations, thirteen 300,000 kw 
generators in all with over 90-percent domestic-parts, have been 
completed, commissioned, and have begun transmitting power. In 
addition, two 600,000 kw generating sets for thermal power 
stations, with over 80-percent domestic-made parts, have been 
commissioned at the Pingxu Power Station and have begun 
transmitting power, thus ranking China among the world's leaders 
in designing, manufacturing, installing, testing, and operating 
large capacity generating sets for thermal power stations. In 
the area of large metallurgical equipment, China is now capable 
of designing and manufacturing international advanced level 
large continuous slab casting machines. As for chemical 
equipment, a capability of annually producing 240,000 tonnes of 
phosphamidon, has been installed in areas including Nanjing. A 
complete set of equipment, with over 80-percent domestic-parts, 
capable of annually producing 200,000 tonnes of synthetic 
ammonia, has been installed at Sichuan Chemical Plant and begun 
operation. 
  It has been learned that the State Council recently decided 
to disband the State Council's Leading Group for Major 
Technological Equipment and transfer its functions to the State 
Economic Restructuring Commission. The Commission will be 
charged with managing major domestic-made equipment and with 
formulating an annual plan for manufacturing domestic-made major 
technological equipment. The purpose is to make use of the 
Economic Management Department's comprehensive functions to 
further promote enterprises' technological progress.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Lianqing (6392 6647 1987)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- This reporter has 
interviewed Zou Jingmeng, director of the China Meteorological 
Administration, on the weather forecast during the flood season 
this year. According to weather forecast, the regions on the 
upper and middle reaches of the Huang He and the northern part 
of North China should particularly pay attention to flood 
prevention during the flood season this year. Regions 
experiencing droughts at present, while combating drought, 
should also watch out for possible floods during the flood 
season. 
  Zou Jingmeng said: During the flood season this year, the 
natural disasters caused by droughts and floods could be more 
conspicuous than last year, and droughts could be more serious 
than floods. As both serious droughts and serious floods are 
likely, we must be fully prepared for them and strive to keep 
losses at a minimum. 
  Concerning weather service activities during the flood 
season, Zou Jingmeng said: At present, the weather departments 
at all levels have been on combat alert. Weathermen will work 
around the clock to closely monitor weather changes and strive 
to offer a good weather service during the flood season. To 
ensure a good weather service during the flood season, the China 
Meteorological Administration has already called on the leaders 
of the weather departments at various levels to go to work on 
the front line, clearly divide work, strictly perform their 
duties, implement the system of responsibility at various 
levels, and be well prepared in terms of mentality, 
organization, technology, equipment, and personnel. 
  Zou Jingmeng particularly emphasized that the weather 
department should provide weather service for the prevention of 
floods both in major rivers and reservoirs and in urban areas, 
so as to protect the people's lives and property.

<F P=106> ["Exchange Square" column by Lulu Yu] </F>
  [Text] Business conferences and investors' forums are 
becoming increasingly useful and important events for those 
doing business in China. Useful and important, that is, for 
those who can afford to attend them. If you're not there, too 
bad. The views and information passed around in these meetings 
are often a closely guarded secret. 
  Which is really unfortunate. There is a lot of good, solid 
information in company presentations at these events which help 
investors understand certain companies better, especially 
recently listed China-based companies. 
  Take Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia's investors' forum 
which 
ended yesterday. It got together 240 fund managers from three 
continents, possessing among themselves a global pool of 
U.S.$3,000bn-3,500bn (about HK$23,400bn-27,300bn) under 
management, and 64 companies from Hong Kong, China and the 
region to exchange views in a four-day seminar and workshop. 
Attending fund managers said it was useful for the chance to 
meet so many company executives from different countries in a 
one-stop visit. 
  The presentations, mixed in quality we were told, helped 
analysts write their reports and fund managers make their 
investment decisions. The company people said it gave them a 
good venue to market themselves to brokers and investors. 
  Yet, the press was barred from covering the forum. The 
reason given was that the participants wanted to speak more 
freely without being placed under the spotlight. It's a reason 
cited increasingly frequently these days. We heard it before at 
a recent business conference in Beijing organised by the 
International Herald Tribune, a newspaper whose own journalists 
were not given full access. 
  In a day and age when transparency is encouraged in public 
companies, it is disappointing to know that businessmen would 
say certain things to analysts and fund managers that they 
wouldn't to the press, and in turn, the general investor who, 
like the institutional investor, is an owner of the company. 
  In fact, this veil of secrecy is adopted mainly for the 
benefit, or at the demand of Chinese companies and officials, 
who don't have a tradition of being open and honest about their 
businesses. 
  Their desire to be as much insulated from public scrutiny as 
possible has unfortunately cowed most people who do business 
with them, including their brokers, to be equally evasive. 
  It is for this reason that many brokerages, including Credit 
Lyonnais, refuse to share their research and their views on 
Chinese companies with the public. A pity really, for a house 
ranked tops for its China research. Some say they have no 
choice. If some of their reports got into the newspapers, a 
number of Chinese companies could see their prices collapse, and 
China might come down on the brokerage like a tonne of bricks. 
  "They have long memories, you know. If you write something 
they don't like, they're going to remember it for a long time. 
It's one thing to give the information to your clients, it's 
another to see it all over newspapers," one Credit Lyonnais 
executive said. He is not alone in his paranoia, or should we 
say, caution. One person from Smith New Court recently got very 
worried when his views on China got published. 
  We know China runs a blacklist of journalists. Maybe they're 
compiling one on analysts, as well.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Airlines Clear Path for Foreign </F>
Investment"] 
  [Text] China will try to upgrade its domestic air 
transport by permitting foreign investment in airlines and 
airports. 
  New policies will permit foreign carriers to invest with 
Chinese airlines and also launch joint or cooperative airline 
companies. 
  Foreign firms also can buy shares of Chinese airlines or 
help 
pay for setting up new airlines. 
  The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) also 
announced in a circular yesterday that foreign businessmen will 
be allowed to invest in and build flying districts for civilian 
airports, including runways and taxiways and parking aprons. 
  Foreign firms and individuals also will be encouraged to 
invest in other ground facilities--terminal buildings, freight 
warehouses, ground services, aircraft maintenance, air catering, 
hotels, restaurants and fuel. 
  In constructing flying districts or terminal buildings, 
however, the Chinese side should have more than 51 per cent of 
registered capital, and both the board chairman and general 
manager should be Chinese. 
  The Chinese agencies said that the government will continue 
exclusive jurisdiction over air traffic control. 
  The CAAC will pick one or two domestic airlines as initial 
experiments in joint operations with foreigners. 
  But in running a joint venture airline, the foreign 
investment will be limited to 35 per cent, and foreign voting 
rights cannot exceed 25 per cent. CAAC did not elaborate. 
  The position of board chairman and general manager should 
also be undertaken by the Chinese part. 
  The directives provide that the Chinese general manager can 
appoint foreigners as assistant managers and other subsidiary 
positions. 
  Airlines with foreign investments will be treated equally 
with airlines owned and operated exclusively by the government 
  The new policy also will allow foreign investment in 
aviation 
for crop and forestry spraying. 
  Foreigners interested in such investments must obtain 
approval from CAAC. The contracts must be ratified by Moftec. 
  Projects with investment beyond CAAC's approval power are 
subject to examination and endorsement of the State Planning 
Commission. CAAC did not specify the sum. 
  Businesses from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao will be allowed 
to invest in the mainland's civil aviation on the same terms. 
  Observers said that civil aviation sector is one of China's 
latest areas open to outside investors. 
  They say the new rules are part of its efforts to open its 
aviation area wider to the outside world.

<F P=106> [By reporters Gan Zhebin (3927 0772 2430) and You Xiayin </F>
(3266 1115 5419): "Xu Bin, Deputy Director of the State 
Administration of Exchange Control, on New Developments in 
China's Foreign Exchange Market"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 10 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--At a 
symposium held here the other day, Xu Bin, deputy director of 
the State Administration of Exchange Control, elaborated on the 
structure and composition of China's foreign exchange market and 
revealed new ongoing developments in the interbank foreign 
exchange market. 
  Xu Bin: At present, China's foreign exchange market can be 
divided into three markets. The first part is the retail 
market, specifically the foreign exchange market between the 
appointed foreign exchange bank and the enterprise. The second 
is the foreign exchange swap market between foreign-invested 
enterprises. It retains its previous role as a swap center and 
specifically offers swap services to foreign-invested 
enterprises. The rates at which foreign-invested enterprises 
buy and sell foreign exchange are the same as the foreign 
quotations published by the People's Bank of China plus 0.15 
percent in handling fees. The price disparity method is not 
used. The third is the interbank foreign exchange market. It 
mainly offers the service of covering the position of appointed 
foreign exchange banks, because they typically either overbuy or 
oversell in the course of settling foreign exchange 
transactions. When such a situation occurs, it can be balanced 
through the interbank foreign exchange market. 
  Xu Bin specifically spoke about the interbank foreign 
exchange market, saying: The interbank foreign exchange market, 
which is now operating healthily, is a nationwide unified and 
standardized exchange market based on the national swap center. 
It has a computer network which is linked with other networks. 
Beginning from 1 March this year, the first five cities linked 
their computer networks and started transactions. On 1 April, 
another 10 cities linked computer networks and began 
transactions. Twenty exchange network points will be linked in 
the near future, making it possible to radiate to all parts of 
the country. 
  He said: The interbank foreign exchange market practices the 
membership system. All banking and nonbank financial 
institutions which have been approved to deal in renminbi and 
which deal in the foreign exchange business at the same time can 
become members of the market. Presently, foreign banks, which 
cannot offer banking services for the import business of Chinese 
institutions, can only engage in one-way sales of foreign 
exchange in the foreign exchange market of the same trade. 
Non-financial institutions, namely industrial and commercial 
enterprises, cannot directly trade in the interbank foreign 
exchange market, because their foreign exchange transactions are 
already handled at the counters of appointed foreign exchange 
banks. 
  Regarding the China Swap Exchange Center recently set up in 
Shanghai, Xu Bin said: The center is a market organization 
which is independent of the State Administration of Exchange 
Control. It only offers settlement and exchange services and 
does not have administrative, examination, or approval functions. 
  Xu Bin made the above remarks at "The Impact of Renminbi's 
Integration With the World Market on the Operations of Foreign 
Enterprises in China," a symposium held by the China Hong Kong 
(Regional) Chamber of Commerce.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- In a clear move to 
enhance its role as a central bank, the People's Bank of China 
(PBC) will publish its national financial and economic forecast 
for the first time since its establishment in 1984. 
  "China Financial Outlook", serving as PBC's annual forecast 
for 1994, features articles, charts and tables of figures. 
  The forecast anticipates that, by the end of July, the 
Central Bank will be able to withdraw the new banknotes put into 
circulation during the first half of this year. 
  It also predicts that personal savings in Chinese banks in 
1994 will total more than 400 billion yuan. 
  To ensure smooth economic development, "China Financial 
Outlook" recommends that the bank continue to adopt a tight 
monetary policy. 
  "We are generally satisfied with the book as we've tried our 
best to present a true picture of the country's financial 
landscape in 1994," said Xie Ping, a leading PBC researcher and 
writer of "a preview of China's financial situation in 1994", 
one of the two keynote articles in the book. 
  According to him, analysis and forecasts are also made in 
areas of investment, prices, foreign trade, financial markets, 
and international current accounting. 
  The book's intensive focus on the Central Bank's monetary 
policy for this year is intended to make it better understood 
and accepted, especially by departments and local leaders. 
  "It is time that the Central Bank's voice should be heard, 
and its views heeded and shared," said Xie, adding that sensible 
enterprises will readjust their strategies in line with Central 
Bank signals. 
  This will in turn contribute to the successful 
implementation 
of the monetary policy, noted Xie. 
  The book will come out in late July and will most likely 
become the Central Bank's model for future annual forecasts.

Finance, Trade, and Commodity Economics under the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences; edited by Lu Wen (7120 2429): 
"Analysis of the Effects and Problems of the 1994 Fiscal and 
Tax Reform Measures"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of 1994, our country implemented 
three major fiscal and tax reform measures. These measures are 
not only major measures involving wide areas, but are basic 
reforms adopted in response to deep contradictions in the fiscal 
and tax structures. The promulgation of these measures indicates 
that the reform of our country's fiscal and tax structures has 
entered a strategically decisive stage. Its success or failure 
will not only affect whether fiscal and tax reforms can push 
through the various obstacles and reach a new stage, but will 
also affect whether or not the goal of building a socialist 
market economy system can be smoothly realized. Thus, people are 
paying very great attention to the results realized by these 
fiscal and tax measures and the various problems they may 
encounter. This article intends to provide a rough analysis of 
these issues. 
<H5>  1. Background To, and Contents of the Measures </H5>
  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, through a series of major efforts, our country's 
fiscal and tax structural reforms have achieved obvious results. 
On the one hand, reform, opening up and economic development 
have been promoted, and, on the other hand, the state's fiscal 
power has been strengthened. However, because of the 
limitations of subjective and objective conditions, the reforms 
have so far been unable to achieve essential change in the 
fiscal and tax mechanisms, and basic contradictions still exist 
between the existing systems and the goal of building a 
socialist market economy structure. These have obstructed the 
establishment of a new macroregulatory and control system 
necessary for the establishment of a market economy. They have 
obstructed the formation of a unified and open domestic market, 
obstructed the transformation of enterprise operational 
mechanisms, and obstructed the sustained, rapid, and healthy 
development of the national economy. Thus, how to speed the 
building of a socialist market economy structure, increase the 
power of fiscal and tax reform, and quickly realize pioneering 
advances in fiscal and tax reform, have become a crucial 
question in current reform and development and urgently require 
resolution. In response to this situation, the central 
authorities are determined to actively promote reform of the 
fiscal and tax structures and implemented the following three 
reforms in early 1994: 1) The existing local financial 
administration contract system is to be changed into a revenue 
sharing system between the central financial administration and 
local financial administrations. The main element of this is 
that, on the basis of rationally dividing the jurisdictional 
range of the central and local governments, by dividing the 
revenue range between the central financial administration and 
the local financial administration based on tax types and 
dividing expenditure ranges in accordance with jurisdiction 
ranges, a system by which the central authorities transfer 
expenditure to local authorities will be established. 2) The 
taxation system will be reformed. This includes reform of the 
enterprise income tax system and reform of the circulation tax 
system. The major element of reform of the enterprise income 
tax system is the unification of income tax rates for 
domestically funded enterprises. While fixing pre-tax 
deductions and expenses standards and unifying the tax base, 
through reference to existing enterprise tax burden levels and 
in order to facilitate a future merger with the income tax rates 
applied to foreign-funded enterprises, tax burdens were reduced 
and a rational, unified proportional tax rate was implemented. 
The main element in the reform of the circulation tax system is 
the establishment of a unified circulation tax system which has 
an value-added tax as its main part, and to change the current 
practice where there are uncoordinated operational taxes, 
value-added taxes, and product taxes. Apart from continuing to 
implement an operational tax in the commodity operational 
sphere, in all other areas, an overall value-added tax is being 
levied. At the same time, the product tax has been changed to a 
consumption tax, and this has been coordinated with the 
value-added tax to carry out special regulation of some consumer 
products. The post-unification circulation tax will be suited 
to both domestically funded and foreign-funded enterprises, and 
it will be possible to abolish the unified industrial and 
commercial tax levied on foreign-invested enterprises. In 
addition, in order to accord with the developments and changes 
of tax sources, some new taxes will be introduced, including the 
value-added land tax, the securities trading tax, the 
inheritance tax, and so on. 3) Taking as a principle the 
separation of the state's function as the owner of assets and 
the government's function as a social manager, the system of 
distributing state and state-owned enterprise profits has been 
reformed. The main element is that after the unification of 
domestically funded enterprises' income tax, the system of 
implementing unified income tax and profit contracts for 
state-owned enterprises will no longer be practiced. On the 
basis of abolishing the levying on state enterprises of key 
energy and communications construction project fund charges and 
budget regulatory fund charges and allowing enterprises to 
include interest on new and accumulated credit in their costs, 
the system of enterprises repaying credit before paying taxes 
will no longer be practiced, and repayments of enterprises' 
credits will be made using funds left after tax has been paid. 
As for after-tax profits, the state, as the owner, will have 
the right to decide how they should be used. Specific measures 
will be decided based on the actual situation of the enterprises. 
  2. The Effects and Significance of These Measures 
  These fiscal and tax measures can be said to be essential 
breakthroughs in fiscal and tax reform ideology, and they show 
that we are escaping from the fetters of the traditional idea of 
"handing down power and allowing the retention of profits" and 
are truly travelling a road of transforming mechanisms and 
innovating systems. This has very great significance both in 
terms of fiscal and tax reform itself and in the overall 
situation of economic reform. These various measures were all 
adopted in response to deep-seated problems in the existing 
financial system and tax system and to the major contradictions 
between these systems and the establishment of a market economy 
structure. Thus, it can be predicted that when the measures are 
implemented, that is, when they are able to overcome or 
alleviate the various defects produced by the old system, which 
obstruct the establishment of a market economy structure, these 
new fiscal and tax reform measures will have very positive 
effects in terms of overcoming fiscal difficulties, 
strengthening the macroeconomic regulatory and control function 
of the financial administration, establishing and perfecting 
macroeconomic and regulatory and control systems, promoting 
transformation of enterprise mechanisms, promoting the formation 
of an open and unified national market, and promoting the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy. 
  1. Reforming the system of local financial contracts. While 
in the new structural plans, it is necessary to maintain some of 
the specific practices of the old system, such as base figures, 
and, in some respects, it is necessary to adopt revenue and 
expenditure ranges based on enterprises' administrative 
relationships, the revenue-sharing reform inevitably involves a 
comprehensive negation of the contract system. This will 
certainly overcome or alleviate in an overall way the various 
defects brought by the contract system and which are 
disadvantageous to the development of the market economy. The 
contradictions between the contract system and the development 
of a market economy are seen in many aspects, but mainly in the 
following three: First, the contract system greatly weakens 
financial macroeconomic regulatory and control powers, and 
directly restricts the establishment of a macroeconomic 
regulatory and control system. This is because the contract 
system restricts the fiscal revenue of the central authorities, 
resulting in the growth in central financial income being unable 
to keep pace with the development of the national economy and to 
keep pace with the growth of overall finances. According to 
statistics, since overall contracts were implemented in 1988, of 
new income each year, the central financial administration only 
obtained a small proportion, and local financial administrations 
obtained over 90 percent of this new income. This unnatural 
situation where the scale of central financial income has 
gradually shrunk has not only resulted in the central financial 
administration losing the financial power necessary for 
macroeconomic regulation and control, but has also weakened its 
capacity to regulate financial strength among regions. This has 
exacerbated inequalities between regions in terms of financial 
and economic development. In addition, as the majority of local 
financial administrations have also implemented financial 
contracts level by level, contracts not only firmly fixed the 
income of the central financial administration, but also 
dispersed local financial strengths, resulting in a highly 
dispersed situation for national financial resources. In terms 
of the utilization of state financial resources, the central 
administration has lost the capacity to gather and distribute 
financial resources. This has exacerbated the difficulties of 
the financial administration and has resulted in state financial 
deficits continuing to climb year after year. It has also 
continually exacerbated inflationary pressures. Second, the 
tendency towards local protectionism has been strengthened, the 
deployment of resources has been harmfully affected, and the 
normal development of the market has been disturbed. The 
financial contract system adopted the method of dividing the 
revenue and expenditure ranges on the basis of the 
jurisdictional relationships of enterprises and institutional 
units, and enterprises' income situations were tightly tied to 
the financial interests of the localities. Thus, localities, 
proceeding from the desire to increase financial income, 
inevitably deploy the resources they control in a way which is 
in accord with the target of maximizing their own financial 
income. In addition, in order to protect their own local 
resources and enterprise sales interests, they may implement 
market blockades, and so on. This not only results in duplicate 
construction and structural convergence between regions, but 
also greatly obstructs the formation of a unified domestic 
market. Third, as the income of enterprises and the financial 
revenue situation of localities are bound together excessively 
tightly, this results in excessive interference by localities in 
enterprise operations. This is not advantageous to the reform 
of separating government and enterprise functions and obstructs 
the transformation of enterprise mechanisms. After replacing 
the contract system with the revenue-sharing system, some of 
these problems will be completely eliminated, while some others, 
while not being completely solved, will be greatly alleviated: 
1) The phenomenon of separate market regimes will be greatly 
reduced, and the formation of a unified, open national market 
will be promoted. This is because an important element of the 
revenue-sharing system is the division of fiscal revenue ranges 
between the central authorities and the localities based on tax 
types, and the division of existing tax types into three types 
-- central taxes, local taxes and taxes shared by the central 
and local authorities. In respect to shared taxes, the practice 
has been adopted whereby, after the central authorities levy the 
tax, a part of it is refunded to the local authorities. 
  In 
this way, while some remnants of jurisdictional divisions are 
maintained in terms of enterprise income tax, in overall terms, 
the old situation of a division of income based on 
administrative jurisdictional relationships has been broken down 
and the local authorities, regardless of whether enterprises are 
under their jurisdiction, still obtain their due revenue from 
the central authorities. Thus, engaging in duplicate 
construction and economic blockades by regions, which are 
intended to safeguard the interests of enterprises under their 
jurisdiction, will lose any real significance. 2) The overall 
financial situation will be greatly enlivened, the enthusiasm of 
both the central and the local authorities will be stimulated, 
and the financial administration's regulatory and control 
capacity will be revived and strengthened. Another aspect of the 
revenue-sharing system is to strengthen the capacity of the 
central financial administration to arrange revenue, and it 
expands the volume and range of expenditure which the central 
financial administration shifts to the local financial 
administrations. Also, diverse but standardized expenditure 
transfer forms can be adopted. This is beneficial to further 
expanding the scale of financial resources which the local 
financial administrations has autonomy in deciding how to 
expend, and to expanding the autonomy of local financial 
administrations. In addition, it creates a dual financial 
source balancing mechanism whereby local financial 
administrations rely on both their own financial resources and 
those financial resources refunded by the central financial 
administration. This changes the old irrational, passive 
situation where the central financial administration relied on 
funds supplied by the local financial administrations in order 
to balance revenue and expenditure. This raises the central 
financial administration's capacity to support local financial 
administrations, and strengthens the regulatory and control 
function of the central financial administration. In 
particular, the diversity and the standardization of the forms 
by which the central authorities refund income to the local 
authorities raises even higher the regulatory and control 
capacity which the central financial administration can exercise 
over the use of local financial resources. 
  2. Reforming the tax system. After implementing a unified 
income tax for domestically funded enterprises and establishing 
a unified circulation tax system which has a value-added tax as 
its main part, there will be a fair tax burden. This will be 
beneficial to equal competition between enterprises and will 
strengthen the regulatory role of taxation. This is because: 
1) Implementing a unified income tax system for domestically 
funded enterprises will eliminate the existing unfair phenomenon 
brought about by the existing enterprise income tax system, 
whereby different economic components have different tax 
burdens. In particular, this will allow state-owned enterprises 
to compete equally, in terms of their tax burdens, with other 
nonstate-owned enterprises. 2) The implementation of a 
circulation tax system, which has a value-added tax for general 
regulation and a consumption tax for supplementary regulation, 
will strengthen the flexibility of the regulatory role of 
circulation tax, strengthen the focus, and will of course 
strengthen the regulatory role of the circulation tax. 
  3. In the distribution relationship between the state and 
state-owned enterprises, we will realize reform by which income 
tax is levied in accordance with the law and no longer practice 
the method of using contracts, whereby income tax and profits 
are tied together. This will ensure that profits and taxes are 
streamed separately. This will provide conditions, on the 
distribution level, for the comprehensive separation of 
government and enterprise functions and will also overcome 
defects produced by the contract system, where the regulatory 
role of taxation was strangled, and allow the revival of this 
regulatory role. In addition, on the basis of abolishing 
state-owned enterprises' profit regulatory tax and ending the 
levying of energy and communications key project construction 
fund charges and budget regulation fund charges, reform by which 
the repayment of credit prior to taxation is changed into 
repayment of credit from retained profits after payment of tax 
will eliminate the defect where enterprises, in their credit 
funds use, just ate from the big pot constituted by the central 
financial administration. This will allow the strengthening of 
enterprise budgets and will be beneficial to the formation of 
self-restraint mechanisms in enterprises. Thus, banks will see 
a consequent increase in credit risks and this will promote the 
development of specialized banks in the direction of enterprise 
operations. 
  In brief, as long as we firmly grasp the spiritual essence 
of 
these fiscal and tax reforms, firmly and unwaveringly implement 
and carry through these reform measures, and achieve the 
transition from the old to the new tax system, the basic results 
anticipated for the reforms will certainly be realized. 
<H5>  3. Problems Which May Occur and Countermeasures </H5>
  The results which have been achieved in the three major 
fiscal and tax reform measures implemented in 1994 can be 
affirmed. However, it must also be recognized that due to 
subjective and objective reasons, in the implementation of these 
measures, it is inevitable that problems of one sort or another 
will arise. Seen from the existing economic structure and the 
interests structure in our country, in the implementation of the 
three major reforms, if we do not do things well the following 
problems will occur: 
  1. The three major reform measures will involve the 
readjustment of interests in many respects. It is impossible 
that such reforms will not touch on the vested interests of 
every side. Thus, in the implementation of the various 
measures, it is inevitable that various obstacles will be 
encountered. 
  In order to carry out the reforms smoothly, we must, in a 
way which seeks truth from facts at the same time as upholding 
the goals and principles of reform, do all that is possible to 
take into consideration the vested interests of all sides to 
dissolve these obstacles. Actually, during these reforms, the 
central authorities have already given full attention to this 
point. In respect to the revenue-sharing system, the central 
authorities have, in setting base figures, in the division of 
tax types, and in setting revenue distribution proportions, 
given very great consideration to the localities. In terms of 
tax system reform, not only have they upheld the principle of 
stressing mechanism transformation and not generally increasing 
the tax burden of enterprises, but they have also adopted 
various measures aimed at reducing the tax burden of 
enterprises. At the same time as simplifying and merging 
enterprise income tax rates and reducing nominal tax rates, the 
central authorities have also abolished the state enterprise 
profit regulatory tax and have abolished energy and 
communications key project construction fund and budgetary 
regulatory fund charges, and so on. In addition, with respect 
to enterprises with low profit levels, the authorities have 
shown concern by setting special transitional income tax rates, 
and for two years, these enterprises will be subject to the 
temporary income tax rates of 27 percent or 18 percent. In 
terms of the reform of the profit distribution relationship 
between the state and state enterprises, at the same time as 
changing the system of credit repayment from pre-tax to post-tax 
repayment, the central authorities have also adopted a series of 
flexible measures and implemented a policy of treating new and 
old credit differently. Old credit can be handled in the old way 
and the new credit can be handled in the new way. At the same 
time, a number of other measures have been adopted by which 
depreciation rates have been raised and long-term credit 
interest payments can be included in costs to strengthen 
enterprises' capacity to repay loans. It should be said that, 
during reforms, very great concern has been shown for the vested 
interests of all sides. However, regardless of conditions, 
reform must involve the readjustment of vested interests, 
otherwise there would be no reform. Thus, in these reforms, 
which are aimed at transforming mechanisms, the concern for 
vested interests must be limited to the degree that such 
concerns does not harm the transformation of mechanisms. If 
this limit is exceeded, then there is a danger that reform will 
exist in name only. 
  2. Revenue-sharing reform cannot be put into place in one 
step. In the short-term, we might see poor results, and if 
things are not done properly there is the danger that we may see 
a resurgence of the defects of the old system in various 
respects. The revenue-sharing system reform involves a basic 
transformation of the financial operational mechanism. A 
complete, standardized revenue-sharing system model will include 
reforms in at least five aspects: 1) The scientific delineation 
of the scope of functions between the central financial 
administration and the local financial administration. 2) The 
division, on the basis of tax type, of the range of financial 
income of the central and the local financial administrations. 
3) The appraisal and fixing, using standardized methods, of 
the expenditure needs of the local financial administrations and 
of the financial income they should receive. 4) A system where 
the majority of financial resources are centered in the central 
financial administration and expenditures transferred to the 
localities. 5) Separation of the budgets of the central and 
local governments and the establishment of separate tax levying 
and management organs. These five elements constitute an 
organic whole. If one element is missing or if any element is 
not implemented in accordance with the standardized 
requirements, this will result in it being difficult to bring 
into play the overall effects of the revenue-sharing system. It 
may even result in a situation where, under a formal 
revenue-sharing system, various defects of the old system 
resurge. It can be seen that the spirit of the revenue-sharing 
system lies in clarifying, standardizing, and legislating 
rights, responsibilities, and interests. Because of the limits 
of current conditions, at the beginning of the reforms we must 
adopt flexible measures and extend the use of some old measures. 
Thus, in the operation of the new structure, it is inevitable 
that some nonstandard elements will emerge and that these will 
restrict bringing into full play the effects of the 
revenue-sharing system. This is particularly so given that 
administrative reforms in our country are still in progress and 
that there still has not been any scientific and concrete 
divisions set down in terms of the respective jurisdictional 
ranges of the central and local governments. Factoral methods 
and standards methods suited to the assessing and fixing of the 
revenue and expenditure figures for local financial 
administrations in our country still await research. Thus, the 
revenue-sharing system which is being implemented cannot yet be 
built on a base which rationally divides the jurisdictions of 
the central and local financial administrations. If this is not 
handled well, there is a danger that we will see a resurgence of 
the defects of the old financial system where the rights and 
responsibilities of the central and local financial 
administrations were not clear and the distribution 
relationships was not stable. In order to guard against this, 
after the first step of the reforms are implemented, we cannot 
halt. We must firmly grasp reforms related to the 
revenue-sharing system, actively create conditions, and, without 
losing the opportunity, push the revenue-sharing system toward 
its target of standardization. First, we must speed the pace of 
administrative structure reform, complete as swiftly as possible 
reform involving the separation of the two functions of the 
government, and, on this basis, scientifically and concretely 
divide the functional range of the central and local governments 
to provide the basis for the overall standardization of the 
revenue-sharing system. Second, we must further deepen reform 
of the tax system to provide conditions for the perfection of 
the revenue-sharing system. 
  In 1994, we have implemented reforms involving a unified 
income tax for domestically funded enterprises and a unified 
circulation tax system which has a value- added tax as its main 
part. However, these reforms cannot overcome the defects of the 
existing tax system whereby local tax types are too few, their 
scale too small, and they cannot accord with the need to 
separate tax types under the revenue-sharing system. Thus, 
after the implementation of the new income tax and circulation 
tax systems, we should continually develop new tax sources and 
develop new tax types, particularly local tax types, to provide 
full taxation system conditions for accelerating the perfection 
of the revenue-sharing system. Finally, we must actively 
develop research on standards methods and factoral methods which 
are suited to our country for setting local financial 
administration revenue and expenditure figures. In the 
financial structure, the question of on what to rely on in 
setting revenue figures for local financial administrations is a 
crucial question which will determine whether the results of the 
financial structure reform will be good or bad. For a long time 
now, we have used a base figure method. Although this method is 
simple and easy to implement, it has many defects, as it is 
actually a method which accepts the status quo. Therefore, we 
must not ignore reform of the base figures, and, as quickly as 
possible, we should use standards methods and factoral methods 
to replace the base figure method. In addition, we must 
accelerate the pace of reforms by which central and local 
budgets are separated and separate tax levying and management 
organs are established to facilitate the positive effects of 
strengthened graded financial administrations brought about by 
the revenue-sharing system. 
  3. In overall terms, the reform of the tax system will not 
increase the burden on enterprises and will not bring about 
inflation. However, this does not mean than we can lower our 
guard. In a situation where prices have basically been made 
subject to the market, taxation changes are a very sensitive 
element in pricing. If they are not handled well, there is the 
danger that structural inflation will occur. Let us now look at 
the two major taxation reform measures. The reform of the 
enterprise income tax system is, whether looked at in an overall 
way or in specific instances, a reform which will, except for a 
few cases, reduce the burden on enterprises. This is because 
the reform, at the same time as merging rates, reduces the tax 
rate and implements transitional tax rates of 27 percent and 18 
percent for enterprises which have low profit levels. 
Concurrently, it abolished the profit regulatory tax for large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and abolishes tasks in 
terms of energy and communications key project construction fund 
payments and budget regulatory fund payments. In addition to 
state-run enterprises, the tax burden of nonstate enterprises 
will also see a reduction. Even income tax for private 
enterprises will see a reduction from 35 percent to 33 percent. 
As for circulating tax reform, overall it will not increase the 
burden on enterprises. According to estimates based on surveys 
by relevant departments, the average circulating tax burden on 
industrial enterprises will be basically the same before and 
after the reforms. Of course, the circulating tax reform is not 
purely a reform which expands the levying of value-added tax, 
but is also a reform to simplify and merge tax types. For 
example, there were originally 13 grades for domestically funded 
enterprises' value-added tax, ranging from 8 percent to 45 
percent. There were also 21 grades of product tax, ranging from 
3 percent to 60 percent. By simplifying these multiple tax 
rates into two rates of 17 percent and 13 percent and applying 
these as product taxes on every product, there will undoubtedly 
be some which will see their rate go up and others which will 
see their rate go down. According to a preliminary survey of 
282 industrial products, 73, or 26 percent of those surveyed, 
saw an increased burden, while 209 products, or 74 percent, saw 
a decreased burden. That is to say, for the majority of 
industries and products, not only will they not see increased 
burdens as a result of the circulation tax reforms, they will 
actually see a reduction. As far as enterprises are concerned, 
except for those enterprises which manufacture a unitary 
product, even if some of the products they produce see an 
increase in their burdens, this will be offset by the reduced 
burden on other products, and the enterprise will not see an 
increase in its tax burden. Thus, seen in overall terms, these 
tax system reforms certainly will not increase the tax burden on 
enterprises and they will certainly not, as some people are 
concerned will happen, give rise to inflation in terms of the 
overall level of prices. However, in a situation where there is 
a change from an intra-price tax to an extra-price tax, and a 
readjustment of circulation tax rates where some rise and some 
fall, it is inevitable that there will be some changes in the 
market price structure and in the structure of commodity prices. 
Thus, in a process where there is an overall and large 
transformation of circulation tax rates, it is quite normal that 
there will be a structural increase in prices. Obtaining, in 
exchange, a fair tax burden and tax mechanism and conditions 
where enterprises are pushed toward equal competition in the 
market is both worthwhile and necessary. We must view this 
phenomenon correctly. What needs to be given attention is that 
in the transformation from the old tax system to the new, if 
price administration is not well coordinated, it will be 
impossible to properly readjust the old tax containing prices, 
and there is a danger that there will be artificial price rises. 
In this respect, there is a need for price controls to manage 
well the readjustment of prices during the transition from the 
old tax system to the new tax system. Those industries and 
products which see a reduced tax burden should lower their 
prices accordingly. 
  Only individual industries and products 
which see an increased tax burden should be allowed to raise 
prices accordingly. We must firmly stop those who, after their 
tax burden has been reduced, not only do not reduce prices, but 
use the opportunity of the tax system reform to raise prices. To 
counter this, we must quickly promulgate relevant price policies 
and regulations for the transition period and fix methods for 
price continuity during the transformation to new system. At 
the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the promulgation of 
the new tax regulations to remove people's misunderstandings 
about the new tax system. 
  4. After the reform by which the method of pre-tax credit 
repayment is turned into post-tax repayment is introduced, 
because flexible measures including old repayment arrangements 
for old credit and new repayments arrangements for new credit 
have been adopted, this reform measure is generally safe. 
However, as far as those enterprises which have accumulated 
large liabilities over time or are not very efficient are 
concerned, there may be some difficulties. These types of 
enterprises are not only limited in terms of their credit 
repayment capabilities and the fact they will find it difficult 
to discard their debt millstones, they will also lose their 
capacity to obtain new loans as a result. This is because, 
while these enterprises can pay off old debts using pre-tax 
profits, because their debts are huge, it will take a long time 
to clear them. Not only will they be unable to get new loans, 
even if they do, they will be unable to repay them. If good 
arrangements are not made for these enterprises, they will sink 
into operational difficulties. With respect to these 
enterprises, we should adopt more powerful measures to rescue 
them. However, we must differentiate between the way in which 
we deal with these enterprises, and we should not adopt uniform 
measures. For example, with respect to those enterprises which 
have poor operations, have experienced losses for consecutive 
years and cannot repay their debts, we should firmly implement 
bankruptcy measures. With respect to those enterprises whose 
products have markets and whose operations can be improved, we 
should provide appropriate support. Dealing with old debts as 
state investment might we considered so that they can speedily 
free themselves from their old debt difficulties, and they could 
be required to improve their results within a defined period. 
With respect to small and medium-sized state-run enterprises, 
we should, in the light of the property rights reform, resolve 
their problems through contracts, leases, sales, or mergers. In 
sum, the debt problems of these enterprises can only be resolved 
through reform of enterprise mechanisms. We certainly cannot 
follow the traditional road of eating from the same big pot.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The index of B-shares 
on the Shanghai Stock Exchange climbed to a new record high to 
close at 71.98 points Thursday, up 1.25 points compared to the 
close of the previous trading day and 4.81 points higher than 
last week. 
  Four B-shares -- Lujian, Refrigerator, Lianhua and Shangchai 
-- topped today's five highest-rising stocks on the exchange, 
ranging from 4.21 percent to 7.14 percent, while the index of 
A-shares witnessed a continuous drop. 
  Experts here attribute the rise of B-shares, exclusive to 
overseas holders, to the better macro-economic situation China 
witnessed from January to April. 
  They pointed out that price hikes basically alleviated in 
April and the rate of foreign exchange remains stable. Foreign 
exchange reserves grow steadily and bank savings are soaring.

<F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] The State Council recently approved a plan 
submitted by the State General Administration of Taxation 
concerning the scope of its functions, the establishment of its 
organization, and the authorized size of its personnel. 
  It was learned that, according to the plan, the major 
functions of the State General Administration of Taxation are as 
follows: To participate in the formulation of taxation laws, 
taxation regulations, and rules for the implementation of tax 
regulations; to study the plans to improve the reform of 
taxation system and to carry them out; to strengthen the 
important regulatory role played by the taxation system in the 
aspects of implementing the state's industrial policy, promoting 
the readjustment of the economic structure, rationalizing 
allocation of resources, and guaranteeing fair competition among 
enterprises; to strengthen taxation to guarantee stable increase 
of financial income; to strengthen the taxation management; to 
establish and improve a tax collection and taxation management 
system which is scientifically standardized and based on the law 
governing tax collection and taxation management; to enhance the 
level of tax collection and taxation management by using modern 
means; and to strengthen the publicity of taxation law. 
  It was learned that China has initially established a 
taxation system suitable to the development of a socialist 
market economy. As a result, the work of tax collection and 
taxation management has gradually become situated on the right 
track and the building of the contingent of taxation personnel 
has been further strengthened.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhu Shengquan (2612 3932 0356), edited by Yang </F>
Jian-xiu (2799 3005 0208): "Strengthen Macroeconomic Management 
of Individually Run and Private Businesses"] 
  [Text] Today, now that individually run and private 
businesses have developed to a certain stage, how are we to 
improve and strengthen government macroeconomic management over 
them so that they are gradually raised in scale, raised in 
grade, and raised in level, and they gradually develop to become 
productive businesses utilizing science and technology and 
oriented to the outside. This is a question worthy of serious 
exploration. 
<H8>  I </H8>
  The 14th party congress decided a policy requiring that we 
encourage and develop individually run and private businesses 
and relax restrictions in terms of their operational scale, 
operational range, development proportion, and business targets 
so that the development of individually run and private 
businesses is further accelerated and they can play a positive 
role in terms of raising overall economic volumes, increasing 
fiscal revenue, and increasing employment channels. The problem 
at present is that many localities have not yet formed truly 
effective management methods, and this situation is not 
conducive to the healthy development of individually run and 
private businesses. 
  1. Seen from the angle of management targets, many 
localities implement the policy of "ruling through inaction." 
They generally do not include individually run and private 
businesses in regional development plans, and even if they are 
included, it is impossible to truly implement the plans. What 
is the reason for this? First, they dare not manage these 
enterprises. Many comrades are still afraid of "private" and 
"capitalist," and they consider "private" and "capitalist" to be 
the same thing. They think that creating conditions for the 
development of individually run and private operations and 
resolving their difficulties is intended to help private persons 
make money and become wealthy, which is the same as developing 
capitalism. Second, they consider that there is no need to 
manage them. Some comrades say that individually run private 
businesses come under the natural market economy, they are 
entirely free to decide on their own operations, and they must 
take responsibility for their own profits and losses. Thus, 
there is no need to manage them. Third, they are unwilling to 
manage them. Some localities believe that at present, 
individually run and private businesses are still quite weak, 
and, at present, the most important thing is to relax policies 
and reduce "intervention"; otherwise, "as soon as they are 
managed they will be strangled." Fourth, they are unable to 
manage them. Many comrades hold that at present new situations 
and new problems are emerging in an unbroken stream and it is 
difficult to manage even state-owned and collective enterprises, 
much less individually run and private businesses. 
  2. At present, the management structure is still in a quite 
confused situation. On the one hand, in their development, 
individually run and private businesses urgently need the 
guidance of information, need to attract skilled personnel, and 
need technological training, legal consultancy and other 
services. However, there is no one to supply them with these 
services. On the other hand, there are many departments which 
issue instructions and orders to individually run and private 
businesses and require them to pay levies. Thus, some 
individual operators and private entrepreneurs have closed down 
their businesses, some pay management fees to "foster" licenses 
and await opportunities, some attach themselves to organs and 
schools and don the "tag" of "township and small town 
enterprises", "school-run enterprises", "welfare enterprises" of 
"organic entities," and so on. Some simply operate without 
licenses. 
  3. Seen from management measures, it is still the case that 
mainly administrative management is used at present. A set of 
macroeconomic legal and economic management methods to oversee 
production and operation activities, exercise product quality 
supervision, and supervise the levying of taxation in respect of 
individually run and private enterprises has still not been 
formed. Thus, first, overall legal guarantees are absent. So 
far, there are only the "Provisional Regulations on Private 
Enterprises" and there is a lack of legal restraints on actions 
which violate the legitimate rights and interests of 
individually run and private enterprises or which interfere with 
their normal operational activities. Even if such activities 
are detected, there is no law with which to punish them. 
Individual merchants and operators of private businesses 
generally feel a lack of security, and they are unwilling to 
expand production. Second, a set of measures for the 
comprehensive economic management of individually run and 
private businesses has not yet been formed. While their 
development is now being encouraged, support and guidance is 
still far from sufficient, and even when the government does 
have some support measures, the phenomenon whereby policies are 
cut off and checked during implementation is very widespread. 
  4. Seen from the contents of management, three major 
problems exist: First, there is a tendency to stress 
"relaxation" and to "look lightly" on management. This is 
mainly seen in the relaxation of policies in many regions, and, 
in practical work, adopting a policy of "first relaxing and 
subsequently guiding and first developing and later improving." 
While this can, to a certain degree, mobilize the enthusiasm of 
individual and private businessmen, it can also bring chaos to 
economic order, spread improper and illegal practices, and 
increases the difficulty of standardized management. Second, 
"fines" are stressed and "education" is looked upon lightly. 
Some departments, in facing illegal phenomena, only engage in 
"stopping." They do not provide any "educational" measures in 
terms of how to operate legally, they do not provide any 
"guidance" measures in terms of which direction they should be 
developing in, and they do not provide any "assistance" measures 
in terms of helping them develop to higher levels. Third, 
stress is placed on building fair market structures, but little 
attention is paid to the coordinated fostering of market 
systems. 
  The building of trade fair markets in various 
places indeed plays a role whereby "the building of a market in 
a place stimulates some industry, which invigorates the local 
economy and brings prosperity to the people." However, in 
comparison with trade fair markets, the various types of 
production factor markets clearly are insufficiently developed 
and, speaking in general, it is still difficult for individually 
run and private enterprises to obtain skilled personnel, 
technology, and raw materials through the market. 
  5. Seen from the management time sequence, in most cases 
management is "passive management." It is often the case that 
only when deviations and problems appear in individually run and 
private businesses, such as structural imbalances, the 
manufacture and sale of poor quality and fake goods, tax 
avoidance or evasion, scams and deceptions, and other types of 
illegal operational activities, and there is a need to 
investigate and punish, is any attention given to such 
businesses. Very rarely is there serious education and guidance 
given to them beforehand. 
  6. Seen from the results of management, there are a number 
of elements which need to be noted. First, the phenomenon of 
uneven development and particularly uneven development between 
regions is very serious. Some regions have even seen a downward 
trend. Second, the structure is not optimal. There is only a 
very small number of individually run and private enterprises 
which engage in deep-level processing of local agricultural and 
sideline products. Third, the scale is not large. Many 
individually run and private enterprises are mum-and-pop shops 
and factories or father-and-son operations, and very few of them 
are large, modern, mechanized producers. Fourth, illegal 
activities frequently occur and some individually run and 
private enterprises evade tax and avoid tax, manufacture fake 
and poor-quality products, engage in smuggling and dealing in 
smuggled goods and the manufacture and sale of pornographic 
books and videos, and so on. 
<H8>  II </H8>
  The government's macroeconomic management of individually 
run 
and private businesses should be carried out through planning, 
coordination, service, guidance and education to help 
individually run and private businesses achieve an increase in 
scale, increase in grade, and increase in level. At the present 
stage, we should place stress on grasping the following aspects: 
  1. We must further change concepts to be able to properly 
deal with relationships in three respects. The first is the 
relationship between developing individually run and private 
businesses, and upholding the prime position of socialist public 
ownership. In our country, a situation has been formed where 
the public ownership economy occupies the prime position and 
diverse economic components see concurrent development. Major 
industries and businesses which affect the national economy and 
the people's livelihood are controlled by the state, and the 
appropriate development of individually run and private business 
will not shake the prime position of the public ownership 
economy. The second is the relationship between developing the 
public ownership economy and developing individually run and 
private businesses. Seen from the short term, after 
individually run and private businesses see development, it is 
inevitable that they will have a certain effect on the public 
ownership economy. However, seen from the long term, they will 
also force state-owned enterprises to change their operational 
modes and operational mechanisms and will result in them 
developing and achieving a higher level. Developing the public 
ownership economy cannot be realized through restricting the 
individually run and private economy. In the same way, 
developing individually run and private businesses cannot be 
realized by weakening the public-ownership economy. We must 
rely on both these components so that through competition, they 
will engage in mutual study and mutual borrowing, the strengths 
of one will make up for the weaknesses of the other, and they 
will see joint development. Third is the relationship between 
the contribution to society made by individually run and private 
businesses and the illegal activities which occur in their 
operations. Seen overall, the vast majority of the individual 
and private entrepreneurs are good, and they become wealthy 
through hard work and operating within the law. Those who engage 
in illegal activities constitute only a small minority. In 
order to promote the development of individually run and private 
businesses, governments at all levels should make overall plans 
and provide support in various respects. 
  2. Improving the external environment and creating fine 
conditions for production operations. 
  1. The public opinion environment. It is necessary through 
newspapers, radio and television broadcasts to make widely known 
the important role which individually run and private businesses 
play in social development. Wide publicity should be given to 
advanced model persons in such businesses so as to raise their 
social status and allow those operators who act in accordance 
with the law to engage in their production operations boldly and 
self-assuredly. 
  2. The legal environment. It is necessary to further 
perfect laws and regulations to clearly stipulate that the 
legitimate rights and interests of individually run and private 
businesses are protected and to specify responsibilities when 
the law is violated. Local ruffians and hoodlums who seize the 
assets of individually run and private businesses and interfere 
in normal production operations must be punished in accordance 
with the law. 
  3. The policy environment. At present, regions differ in 
the degree of relaxation of their policies in respect of 
individually run and private businesses. The coastal regions 
are more relaxed than the hinterland regions and the developed 
regions are more relaxed than the undeveloped regions. 
  In future, we must continue to relax restrictions. First, 
we need to relax the operational range, and we should allow 
individually run and private businesses to operate in all 
industries and produce all products not restricted by state 
policies. Second, we should relax development proportions, and 
in accordance with the level of development of the productive 
forces in particular areas, such businesses should be allowed to 
develop as far as they can. There should not be any artificial 
development proportions imposed. Third, restraints on scale 
should be relaxed, and individually run and private businesses 
should be encouraged to develop trans-regional and 
trans-industry operations. They should also be allowed to 
contract, lease, merge with, or purchase state-owned enterprises 
and to run joint-fund cooperative enterprises. Fourth, 
restraints in terms of credit and tax reductions should be 
relaxed, and the tax burden of individually run and private 
enterprises should be brought closer to that of publicly owned 
enterprises. It might also be possible, in accordance with 
state industrial policies, to allow them to enjoy various tax 
reductions or tax remissions like state and collective 
enterprises. Banks should include individually run and private 
enterprises in their credit budgets and, if the operations of 
enterprises are in accord with state industrial policies and 
have good results, they should be given credit support. 
  4. The market environment. In accordance with the principle 
that the one who invests is the one who obtains the benefits, we 
should continue to encourage social investment in developing 
various types of markets, expand the range of these markets, and 
link them up with the national and international markets. It is 
particularly important to develop various types of production 
factor markets. 
  3. Strengthening management and education so that 
enterprises raise their own quality. First, it is necessary to 
strengthen the concept of law and strengthen the concept of 
business ethics so that these businesses operate in accordance 
with the law. Illegal activities by individually run and 
private enterprises not only harm society, but are also 
disadvantageous to the healthy development of such enterprises. 
In response, we should, on the one hand, rely on the government 
to strengthen education, and, on the other hand, rely on the law 
to seriously investigate and punish violations. In respect of 
the tax issue, in cases where tax exemption is appropriate, 
enterprise should be exempted from tax, while in cases where tax 
levying is appropriate, tax should be levied. We cannot blur 
the distinction between these two options. Second, we need to 
strengthen the market economy concept. Through mass 
organizations such as industrial and commercial federations, 
individual operators' associations, private business operators' 
associations, and so on, education and guidance can be 
strengthened, and these businesses can be assisted to speedily 
establish market economy concepts which are in accord with 
modern market competition. Third is raising the quality of 
management. It is necessary to strengthen training in 
management knowledge for individual operators and private 
entrepreneurs. They should be encouraged to join some business 
associations and societies to help them raise their management 
level. Fourth is raising the quality of science, technology, 
and culture. Relevant departments, while carrying out various 
types of cultural training, must draw in and encourage the 
participation of individual industrial and commercial operators 
and private entrepreneurs. 
  4. Strengthening coordinated services so that these 
enterprises develop in an orientation of productive, externally 
oriented enterprises which make full use of science and 
technology. First, it is necessary to sort out and reorganize 
individually run and private businesses. When individual 
industrial and commercial operators have achieved a certain 
scale and have the conditions for registration and issuance of a 
private enterprise license, they should be encouraged to change 
their registration. In respect of those who operate without a 
license, it is necessary to actively do good work to make it 
convenient for them to obtain a license. If they do not then 
seek a license, they should be firmly outlawed. In respect of 
those private enterprises which are still attached to collective 
economy units, it is necessary to clearly explain policies and 
separate them from the collective economy in accordance with the 
law so that they can travel a healthy road of development. 
Second, it is necessary to optimize structures. This will 
mainly involve information guidance and industrial policy 
guidance to help them effect changes in four respects: First, 
they should make the change to production enterprises, and, 
particularly, to enterprises engaged in deep-level processing of 
agricultural and sideline products and the manufacture of 
farming tools and equipment and other industries which serve 
agriculture so that they can travel a road where agriculture, 
industry, and trade are combined. Second, they must change 
towards becoming enterprises which make full use of science and 
technology. That is, they must adopt modern advanced science 
and technology, increase the scientific and technological 
content of products, raise the product grade, and realize 
prosperity through science and technology. Relevant government 
departments must actively develop technological consultancy and 
technological guidance. Third, they must change into 
enterprises which achieve economies of scale. On the one hand, 
they can be guided, on the basis of voluntary participation, to 
organize cooperative organizations, while on the other hand they 
can be guided to use their profits to expand reproduction and 
expand the scale of production. Relevant government departments 
must actively participate in feasibility studies and only if 
projects are in accord with state industrial policies should 
they be given support. Fourth, they should change into 
externally oriented enterprises. Relevant government departments 
must do well as "navigators" and support individually run and 
private enterprises to enter international markets. Departments 
should help enterprises to link up with foreign sales avenues, 
act as a bridge in drawing in foreign funds, and do well in 
consultancy work, such as investigating the funds situation of 
foreign businesses and providing information on the economic 
situation abroad. Those private enterprises with the conditions 
should be encouraged to set up companies abroad and they should 
be given autonomy in foreign trade.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- China has seen the 
fastest growth in the world in terms of housing construction in 
the last 15 years, according to the latest statistics compiled 
by a U.N. organization. 
  The average per capita living space for urban Chinese 
residents has risen to 7.4 sq.m. at present, a sharp contrast 
to the mere 3.6 sq.m. fifteen years ago. 
  According to Deputy-Minister of Construction Tan Qinglian, 
urban Chinese residents are now enjoying better housing 
conditions, with larger houses, better architectural designs and 
more beautiful residential environments. 
  The senior official said that residential housing has been 
given top priority in China as a result of the government's 
macro control over the once overheated real estate industry. 
According to him, the construction of luxury hotels, apartments 
and villas has been strictly controlled since May of last year. 
  The deputy-minister expects record growth this year in the 
construction of total floor space and the average per capita 
living space. 
  To boost the construction of residential housing, the 
government has granted preferential treatment to housing 
construction companies in terms of land allocation and reduction 
or exemption of taxes as well as loans and materials supply. 
  According to the government housing plan, the average per 
capita living space for urban Chinese residents should reach 8 
sq.m. by the turn of the century. To meet the target, China 
has to build 150 million to 180 million sq.m. in floor space 
every year before the end of the century. 
  The leading official said that the housing strain is still 
serious in China. Taking the country as a whole, more than 4 
million urban households still live in houses with a floor space 
of less than 4 sq.m. per person. 
  In addition, over 30 million sq.m. of old and dilapidated 
houses need to be renovated.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- China encourages its 
automobile companies to establish transdepartmental and 
transregional giants by merger, annexation or setting up stock 
companies. 
  According to a new policy, four or five auto giants 
competitive in the world market will be set up by the end of 
this century. The output of these giants is expected to produce 
70 percent of China's total. 
  During the past 40 years China has put about 34 billion yuan 
into the auto industry. 
  Statistics show that China's annual output capacity of 1.3 
million automobiles is distributed across more than 120 plants. 
With low-quality products and high production costs, China's 
auto industry can meet neither the demand of domestic market nor 
the challenge of international competition. 
  According to experts, when the annual output increases from 
1,000 to 50,000 at an auto company, the production costs will 
decreases by 40 percent; when output increases to 10,000, costs 
decrease by another 15 percent; when output is 20,000, costs 
decrease by a further 10 percent; and when the annual output 
hits one million, the production costs will decrease by about 
another 10 percent. 
  Most of China's auto companies do not reach the minimum 
effective annual output scale of 60,000 to 100,000, except for 
eight major enterprises. 
  According to the policy, China will not approve any new 
projects for assembling vehicles in the coming few years. 
Attention will be paid to lowering production costs and to 
extending production scale in the existing companies. 
  China is expected to have 20 million automobiles running by 
2000, of which 4.5 million will be sedan cars. This indicates 
that China's auto output during this period will hit three 
million, including 1.5 million sedan cars. 
  To reach the target, the only way out for China's auto 
industry is mass production, experts said. 
  To cope with the competition in the domestic and 
international markets, some large auto companies in China have 
begun to look for partners for co-operation or targets for 
annexation nationwide in recent years. 
  Auto industries in the developed countries such as the U.S. 
and Japan have experienced mergers and annexation in the course 
of their development. China's auto industry will do the same in 
order to become a pillar industry, the experts said.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Lin Ying (2651 7751): "China </F>
Uses Foreign Funds To Quicken Development of Power Industry"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 29 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--With the 
high-speed development of the economy, the supply of energy in 
mainland China has become more and more strained. In 
particular, the supply of electric power is 20 percent short of 
demand. If the national economy continues to grow at an annual 
rate of 8 to 9 percent, the country will need 300 million kw of 
power generating facilities by the end of this century. To 
basically meet the need, beginning this year, new generating 
capacity of 15 million kw will have to be added each year. 
Therefore, China is orienting a policy of inviting foreign 
investment in the energy industry and hopes that $30 billion to 
$40 billion of foreign funds will be invested in the energy 
industry in order to make up for the power shortage. 
  In fact, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant, which was built a 
number of years ago, served as a trial for introducing foreign 
funds and technology. Hong Kong's China Light and Power and 
Electricite de France were invited to participate in the 
construction of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong. 
The pressurized water reactor was supplied by a French company. 
After that, Shandong also cooperated with the French power 
company by jointly investing billions of U.S. dollars to build a 
number of thermal power plants with a generating capacity of 22 
million kw. At the same time, Electricite de France will help 
Shandong modernize its existing power plants and increase 
generating capacity by 36 million kw. 
  Encouraged by China's favorable policies, some American 
companies have also invested in China's power industry in recent 
years. For example, Saide [sai de 6357 1795] Electric Company 
built the largest power plant in Hainan Province in Sanya City. 
Investment in the first phase of the project amounted to $1 
billion, and the generating capacity will reach 1.2 million kw. 
Gross investment in the three phases of the project will reach 
$4 billion, and the total generating capacity will reach 4.8 
million kw. Another American company, Kangdena [kang de na 1660 
1795], cooperated with Guangdong Environmental Engineering 
Company to invest $50 million in Nanao County to build a 
wind-driven power plant, where generating capacity will reach 
200,000 kw. 
  Before and after this, Siemens of Germany cooperated with 
the 
mainland's Dongfang Electrical Machinery to invest $100 million 
in building a 600,000-kw turbine generator assembly plant to 
meet the need for generating equipment in various large power 
plants. In addition, Babcock of Germany provided two 300,000-kw 
generator sets to Tianjin's Yangliuqing Power Plant, and the 
total value of the equipment was $140 million. 
  Hong Kong's Hopewell Company recently invested in two 
thermal 
power plants in Guangdong. Another large Hong Kong corporation, 
Cheung Kong Enterprises, has also invested $257 million to build 
a 570,000-kw power plant in Guangdong's Nanhai City. Together 
with Hutchison Whampoa, Cheung Kong Enterprises also invested 
$500 million to build the Zhuhai Power Plant in Guangdong. The 
first phase of the project will install four 660,000-kw 
generator sets. At the same time, Cheung Kong Enterprises 
invested $70 million to build a 100,000-kw thermal power plant 
in Tianjin, Hopewell invested $1 billion to build two 600,000 
generator sets in Tianjin's Beitang. In addition, a number of 
Hong Kong companies formed an investment consortium to build a 
large power plant in Fujian's Meizhou Bay. Investment in the 
first and second phase of the project will reach $400 million 
for the installment of 1.6 million-kw generating equipment. 
Hong Kong's Pokai Group invested $50 million to build a 
100,000-kw thermal power plant in Longyan in Western Fujian. 
Hong Kong's Onyin Enterprising invested $53 million to build a 
100,000-kw power plant in Zunhua City in Hebei Province. 
  It is learned that some Hong Kong companies, such as Asian 
Power, China Light and Power, New World Development, and Wingsan 
have recently also contacted relevant departments on the 
mainland to launch investments projects in the power industry. 
At the same time, ABB of Europe, General Electric of the United 
States, Nishiya, Hitachi and Toshiba of Japan, (Aoyi amd Fuyite) 
[3421 0181 0126 0181 3676] of Germany, and General Electric of 
Canada have also successively sought cooperation opportunities 
with China in developing the power industry. 
  In addition, Fujian, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and Hainan 
Provinces, 
which are planning to construct nuclear power plants, are trying 
to invite foreign investment and introduce foreign technological 
cooperation in developing the nuclear power industry.

  [Text] Nanjing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- To Mr. Tang Liuzhao, 
manager of Changzhou Natural Pigment Company, Ltd. in Jiangsu 
Province, his cooperation with foreign investors means that he 
and his fellow countrymen can step onto the world economic stage. 
  The Chinese agricultural sector used to export its products 
through the National Foreign Trade Corporation, but now the 
newly founded joint ventures have their own right and ability to 
trade on the international market. 
  Mr. Tang has traveled overseas several times and has had 
direct talks with foreign traders. For him, the price and 
demand for natural pigments around the world is well in his mind. 
  With China's opening policy, foreign-funded enterprises in 
agriculture are booming, which helps China's agriculture to 
catch up with international standards. 
  The development of China's socialist market economy has 
brought China's agricultural products face to face with severe 
competition both on the domestic and foreign markets. 
  The Chang Jiang River delta is a great grain producing area 
in China. Jiangsu Province is just located in this area. 
  The province has made great efforts to introduce foreign 
funds to develop joint venture agricultural enterprises. 
Statistics up to the end of last year showed there were 600 
such enterprises in the province, and the number was rising in 
the first quarter of this year. 
  The characteristics distinguishing the development of 
Jiangsu's foreign-funded agricultural enterprises are: first, 
joint ventures' production has changed from agricultural product 
processing to both planting and raising, and service; second, 
cooperation has broadened from investors in Hong Kong and Taiwan 
to include those from Japan, the U.S., Australia and Europe; and 
third, the introduction of high-tech programs has increased, and 
the amount of investment become larger. 
  The development of Jiangsu's joint venture agricultural 
enterprises shows the prospects of China's agricultural 
modernization. 
  The new type of enterprises engage not only in producing and 
processing, but also in domestic and foreign trade, which means 
a break from the past in which producing and selling were 
separate. 
  A convincing example is the development of a joint eel 
industry company in Dantu County of the province. The company 
used to be an eel raising pool. In 1988, it used 5 million 
dollars to build a 280,000-sq-m indoor and 3,000-mu 
(200,000-sq-m) outdoor eel raising pool. In the meantime, it 
set up an eel feed company, an eel roasting factory and a trade 
company jointly with Japanese, Shanghai and Guangdong companies. 
In such steps, it formed an enterprise system from raw 
materials to processing to sales. Now the company has fixed 
assets of 125 million yuan. 
  The joint venture agricultural enterprises are closely 
connected with thousands of rural households. 
  A food company in the port city of Lianyungang is such an 
example. It is a vegetable processing plant which has 
introduced 400 kinds of improved varieties of vegetable seeds. 
After testing, it organized farmers to plant these vegetables 
and offered seeds and technical services, with the farmers later 
selling the vegetables to the company according to contract. 
Now, the company exports about 80 million tons of vegetables 
annually. 
  The introduction of improved crop seeds and advanced 
agricultural techniques from overseas has helped local farmers 
greatly in improving agriculture production and processing in 
order to compete on international market.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- China has succeeded in 
applying rare earth to over 800,000 ha of forests, a world 
record, according to an official from the Ministry of Forestry. 
  Rare earth elements are a new type of growth regulators. By 
using scientifically-made fertilizers mixed with rare earth 
elements to dress seeds, dip roots or spray leaves, the growth 
of trees is promoted. 
  China started to use rare earth in agriculture and forestry 
in the 1980s, the earliest in the world. In 1992 the technology 
was popularized and applied to over 30 strains of trees, 
including walnut, date, pear, Chinese chestnut and Chinese 
hawthorn as well as grape vines. 
  Research results show that the output of a fruit tree 
cultivated with fertilizers containing rare earth elements 
increased by 10 percent to 40 percent. Besides, the fruit 
contains more sugar, Vitamin C and other nutritious elements. 
The 50 pilot counties in Beijing municipality and the Provinces 
of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Shandong and Henan invested about 
one million yuan (about 115,000 U.S. dollars) in the application 
of rare earth to fruit production, and they managed to increase 
their output of fruit by a total of 50 million kg, worth 100 
million yuan. 
  Scientists also found that by applying rare earth, pine 
seeds 
will germinate earlier and pine trees will grow more quickly. 
Besides, by spraying rare earth elements on them, deciduous 
trees in north China remain green longer in the autumn. 
  In recent years the ministry of forestry, and provincial and 
city departments of forestry have taken various measures to 
popularize the technology of applying rare earth elements, 
including holding training classes, lectures, exhibitions and 
on-the-spot teaching.

  [Text] The party and government leading comrades at various 
levels should firmly remember the purpose of the party, 
strengthen the sense of the masses, be concerned with the woe 
and weal of the masses, always be concerned with the well-being 
of the masses, help the masses solve their practical problems in 
production and livelihood, accelerate the economic development 
of the less developed areas, and help them turn poverty into 
wealth as soon as possible and change their appearances. This 
was what Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, prominently stressed during his investigation and 
study activities in Qihe on 23 May. 
  Jiang Chunyun has regarded Qihe as an area that he keeps in 
contact with while dealing with his work. Over the past year, 
he has established profound ties with the local people there. 
  On the morning of 23 May, Jiang Chunyun went to (Dayang) 
Village of (Xiaozhou) Township. He successively visited the 
homes of Villagers (Yang Ailin) and (Yang Meilin) and the 
vegetable growing areas in (Dayang) Village. He asked them 
about their vegetable planting and marketing situation as well 
as their income. He suggested that they should achieve not only 
production but also marketing. 
  Jiang Chunyun also visited the fine wheat seed cultivating 
base in (Dayang) village to understand the wheat and cotton 
growing situation. 
  He said: Cotton is a major advantage of the northern and 
western areas of Shandong Province as well as a pillar of the 
rural economy. So, we should exert great efforts to grasp cotton 
production. After that, he went to the construction site of the 
on-going (Huajiao) road; called on the personnel who were 
engaging themselves in the construction work, including the 
cadres of the provincial agricultural commission, the provincial 
personnel affairs department, the provincial radio and 
television department, and the provincial (?export) company who 
take on jobs in Qihe; and also wielded a shovel to join the 
labor. 
  He earnestly said to these cadres: Promoting a coordinate 
development of the eastern and western parts of the province and 
seeking common wealth is a major task that the province should 
make efforts to fulfill. Helping the people in less developed 
areas turn poverty into wealth as soon as possible is an 
unshirkable duty of the party cadres and the people's public 
servants. So, we should firmly foster the purpose of serving 
the people, have a profound feeling to do more concrete deeds 
for the people, and make contributions to rejuvenating the 
economy in these areas and bringing about happiness to the 
people there. 
  After hearing the reports made by the leaders of Dezhou 
Prefecture and Qihe County, Jiang Chunyun urged that Dezhou 
Prefecture and Qihe County should take the lead in narrowing the 
gaps with the eastern areas and turning poverty into wealth as 
soon as possible. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out that to deepen reform, we should 
implement the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 
14th party Central Committee, focus on setting up the socialist 
market economic system, promote overall reform, and make a key 
breakthrough. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: We should persist in the principle 
of taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are 
tough and actually ensure to grasp both material and spiritual 
civilizations and to make achievements in these two aspects.

  [Text] The second plenary session of the Sixth Shandong 
Provincial CPC Committee opened in the Nanjiao Guest House of 
Jinan on 26 May. The session is chiefly aimed at earnestly 
studying and implementing the spirit of the central authorities' 
directives on enhancing studies; discussing and formulating 
plans and measures for enhancing studies; and further whipping 
up an upsurge of studies throughout the province so as to 
upgrade in an overall way the quality of the broad masses of 
cadres and particularly of leading cadres in the fields of 
politics, professions, science, and culture; to upgrade their 
capability in having the socialist market economy well in hand; 
and to promote the steady development of reform and 
modernizations. 
  Through the discussion and examination at the plenary 
session, the participating members approved the decision made by 
the Shandong Provincial CPC Committee on enhancing studies, 
which is composed of the following four parts: 1) Efforts 
should be made to fully discern the importance of enhancing 
studies under the new situation. 2) Major tasks and demands for 
studies. 3) Efforts should be made to carry forward the 
studying style of integrating theories with reality. 4) Efforts 
should be made to enhance the organizational leadership over 
studies. 
  It was pointed out at the session that currently we are at 
the important moment of turning the planned economy into a 
socialist market one and that the new situation and tasks have 
imposed new and higher demands on us. Enhancing studies to 
generally upgrade the political theory of the broad masses of 
party members and cadres and their professional and technical 
quality represents an urgent political task of the entire party. 
All party members and cadres should fully discern the 
enhancement of studies that has an important and far-reaching 
bearing on realizing new historical changes and suiting the 
demands of new situations and tasks. We should consciously 
respond to the call put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin with 
regard to studying, studying, and studying again and whip up an 
upsurge of studying. Efforts should be made to take the great 
improvement of ideological theories and knowledge level to 
promote the great development of reform and construction. 
  It was stressed at the session that in conducting studies, 
we 
should firmly bear in our minds the province's reality and 
chiefly study the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and particularly 
the Third Volume of Deng Xiaoping's Selected Works. At the same 
time, efforts should be made to study the theories and basic 
knowledge of the market economy and the knowledge of modern 
science and technology. An emphasis should be placed on 
successfully studying the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  The study agenda at the plenary session was organized by the 
provincial party standing committee. 
  Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
delivered a speech in which he urged the leading personnel of 
party and government organs at all levels to follow the demand 
put forward by General Secretary Jiang Zemin with regard to 
studying more and having less social activities and to set an 
example in studies for the broad masses of party members and 
cadres. He put forward that it is necessary to launch an 
emulation drive on study among the leading cadres to encourage 
them to study more and to conduct deeper and better studies. We 
should also encourage these leading cadres to take the action of 
regarding the painstaking study in this regard as practice to 
bring along the studies of the broad masses of party members and 
cadres and to foster a strong atmosphere of studies throughout 
the province. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: We should have the overall 
situation in mind and firmly grasp the dialectical relations 
among the three big events of reform, development, and

  [Text] Following the completion and the opening of digital 
telecommunications throughout the whole province in March this 
year, Shandong's department of Posts and Telecommunications has 
decided recently to go a step further to build up and complete 
six large networks and to quicken construction of an information 
highway throughout the province. 
  The six large networks are as follows: 1) The province's 
Digital division exchange network to cities and prefectures will 
be expanded from province to the county level. 2) Medium and 
high speed digital data telecommunications network, known as DDN 
will be connected and open in cities at and above the city and 
prefectural level. It will also be connected with a national 
DDN backbone network, and then expanded to the county and city 
level. 3) Mobile telecommunications network covering the whole 
province. 4) Complete and open a wireless paging network which 
can scan the whole province automatically. 5) Build 168 
information stations in the province. 6) Complete and open the 
visual telephone conference network that connects the cities at 
and above the city and prefectural level in the province. In 
the meantime, Shandong's department of posts and 
telecommunications determined to develop various urgently needed 
telecommunications services in a timely manner to meet the 
demand of large numbers of consumers. 
  It was reported that 17 May is the 26th world 
telecommunications day. The topic is "telecommunication and 
culture." The commemorative symposium convened for this will be 
held by the provincial posts and telecommunications 
administration in Jinan on the afternoon of 16 May.

  [Text] Shanghai, 25 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The Pudong 
New District will adopt BOT [build, operate and transfer] and 
other forms to more effectively invite foreign investment and to 
speed up the construction of urban infrastructural facilities in 
the new district. 
  This was learned from the urban construction work conference 
yesterday. 
  BOT is an investment form which is different from the 
previous practice of state appropriation. Chinese and foreign 
enterprises are not only investors in various projects, but are 
also managers and operators. Thus, investors may earn certain 
returns. At present, the cross-river tunnel that links Yanan 
East Road on both sides of the Huangbu Jiang was a project which 
adopted the BOT form, and the investor in the project is Hong 
Kong's CITIC Group. 
  Earlier this year, the institutions concerned in Pudong put 
forth a number of BOT projects for inviting overseas investment, 
and these projects aroused strong interest among would-be 
investors. These projects included Route Number 1 of the Light 
Railway, a garbage incinerator, a central heating system, a 
waterworks, an airport express highway, and trunk roads in the 
new district. 
  In addition, Pudong will allow collectives and individuals 
to 
make investments in or run some projects which are urgently 
needed. The government will adopt certain favorable policies to 
support such investment. At the same time, the market system 
for urban construction will be established and fostered, and the 
policymaking consulting mechanisms and technological reserve for 
urban construction and management will be strengthened. 
  This year is a crucial year in the construction of the new 
district. A number of major projects, including five major 
roads and one major bridge, power supply facilities, 
communications facilities, and environmental improvement 
projects, will be completed within this year. 
  People in the institutions concerned said that the measures 
adopted by Pudong for strengthening urban construction will be 
favorable to overcoming the shortage of funds, to introducing 
advanced management methods from foreign countries, and to 
bringing a benign cycle to the construction of the new district.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Banking in Shanghai, 
China's largest economic center, has entered a new stage of 
internationalizing its operations, said Mao Yingliang, president 
of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China. 
  A complete financial system has been set up over the last 
decade of reform and opening to the outside world, Mao said. 
Now it does not only have a short-term money market, but also 
securities market, and foreign exchange swap market. The system 
also include foreign banks and a large number of other 
institutions engaging in banking or non-banking financial 
operations. 
  At present, more than 2,200 banking organizations from at 
home and abroad have branch banks and offices here. 
  Last year the transactional volume of different securities 
topped 500 billion yuan, an increase of about six times over the 
previous year; that of foreign exchanges climbed to 5.294 
billion U.S. Dollars, up 43.2 percent; and interbank loans 
topped 232 billion yuan, up 37 percent. 
  Shanghai not only borrows from foreign banks and governments 
but also issues bonds overseas, according to the official. 
  It concluded 59 contracts on borrowing a total of 511 
million 
U.S. dollars last year. 
  Aiming at making itself an international financial center, 
Shanghai plans to expand the number of foreign-funded banks from 
the present 26 to 50 by 1997.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, an 
international metropolis, has again become prominent on the 
western shore of the Pacific Ocean, after 45 years of 
construction. 
  Since May 27, 1949, when the government of the New Republic 
took over the city from the Kuomintang, the fixed assets 
investment in state-owned enterprises here has accumulated to 
250.4 billion yuan, a more than 40-fold increase over 1952. Its 
annual increase has reached 19.8 percent, 
  The traditional industries, such as textiles, shipping, 
power 
and iron and steel, have expanded their production capacities -- 
in some cases even hundreds of times. 
  The modern pillar industries like automobiles and 
telecommunications have grown rapidly from the ground up. 
  Statistics show that in the 1953-1993 period the city 
registered an annual growth of 8.6 percent in output value, 11.7 
percent in local finance, 9.7 percent in industrial output value 
and 8.9 percent in retail turnover. 
  Compared with 1952, the city's export volume shot up 
61-fold, 
and imports, 888-fold. 
  This rising economic strength has given a push to the 
sectors 
of science, education, medicine and health. 
  Now, the city boasts a strong technical force of 888,800 
professionals and a comprehensive medical care system. 
  Citizens' incomes, excluding inflation indices, have 
increased by an average of four percent a year since 1952. 
  The dynamic market economy, featuring rising industries such 
as securities, telecommunications and real estate, and the 
development of the Pudong New Area, has been strongly backed by 
the ongoing infrastructure construction, which is forging ahead 
with 60 billion yuan poured in this year. 
  It is expected that the 1990s will be a take-off decade for 
Shanghai to become a financial and trade center for the whole 
Asia-Pacific region.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Cheng Weimin (4453 3634 3046): "Check </F>
the Actual Situation, Promote Leadership, Improve Understanding, 
and Pass on Experiences"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the Zhejiang Provincial People's 
Government convened a meeting of responsible persons from 
relevant provincial departments in our newspaper office 
specially to hear reports from a team on a news assignment 
entitled "1,000-Li March on Grain Planting." It also reviewed 
and made plans for the next phase of agricultural production and 
reform. Wan Xueyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor, and Liu Xirong, standing committee 
member of the provincial party committee and vice governor, 
addressed the meeting. 
  The first phase of the news-gathering activities, which were 
launched upon the suggestion of provincial government leaders, 
lasted from 5 to 15 May. Reporters interviewed over 100 
peasants from more than 10 counties, cities, and districts and 
scores of villages around the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou areas, and 
published 65 manuscripts. 
  Wan Xueyuan thanked reporters who participated in the 
news-related activities on behalf of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government. He said: The 
activities serve to "check the actual situation, promote 
leadership, improve understanding, and pass on experiences." 
Through the activities, reporters gained an in-depth 
understanding of the progress in implementing measures adopted 
by the central authorities, the provincial party committee, and 
the provincial government to support agriculture, and of the 
progress in tilling the acreage planned for early season rice. 
The reporters described fresh experiences gained by some 
localities and drew our attention to some issues concerning our 
work. They also reported on experiences gained by localities 
which fared well in grain production, and encouraged local 
leaders to make further improvements. The reporters' 
on-the-spot learning experiences helped promote work and 
leadership, and issues raised in relevant reports greatly 
inspired comrades undertaking agricultural work. Such reports 
further promoted ties between cities and rural areas and between 
industrial and agricultural sectors, and helped the entire 
society understand more about grain production. Governments at 
all levels should seriously sum up, popularize, study, and 
examine fresh experiences -- disclosed through news-related 
activities -- which could help strengthen and improve leadership 
over agricultural production, and the numerous suggestions made 
by grass-roots cadres and peasants. 
  Wan Xueyuan said: The news-related activities enabled us to 
hear the peasants' true wishes. All trades and professions 
should earnestly acquire the thought of serving the peasants 
wholeheartedly, and do solid work to really solve the peasants' 
worries and difficulties by bearing in mind what the peasants 
want. Grain departments should earnestly improve and step up 
their services by taking grain procurement from major 
grain-producing households as their focal point. The method 
used to grant agricultural credits should be improved, and major 
grain-producing households should be accorded preferential 
treatment. Enterprises producing farm machinery should satisfy 
the peasants' needs by developing and producing top-quality farm 
machinery in line with the realities of our province. 
  Wan Xueyuan said emphatically: Operations conducted on a 
moderate scale would help promote the province's agricultural 
production and development, particularly grain production and 
development. Work to promote such operations should be regarded 
as an important element in our province's rural reform. We 
should study and popularize such operations rapidly and more 
vigorously. We should respect the masses' creative initiative, 
and continuously sum up, improve, and popularize things in 
practice. 
  Wan Xueyuan said: The activities further expanded the scope 
of news-related work and brought such work closer to the central 
task of the party and government. They also provided very good 
training for young reporters. He said: All news units and 
relevant departments should help augment the team to be assigned 
to the second phase of the "1,000-Li March on Grain Planting," 
which will begin soon. This team should file more in-depth 
reports which will provide tighter supervision over public 
opinion and more intense policy-oriented propaganda. 
  Liu Xirong said: Through the hard work of leaders at all 
levels in our province and the vast numbers of peasants, the big 
decreases in grain production have now been reversed. However, 
we should know better than to be optimistic about the situation 
concerning agricultural and grain production. We should further 
increase propaganda conducted through the media by carrying out 
the "1,000-Li March on Grain Planting" activities, so that we 
could urge all localities to implement party and government 
policies which focus on agriculture. We should use propaganda 
to accelerate reform and opening up. The aim of the reform of 
grain and other agricultural production is to rationalize prices 
of agricultural products and to enable peasants to do their 
farming according to the laws of market. We should promote 
fairly large-scale operations as they provide the best way for 
improving the low efficiency of agricultural production. 
However, help from relevant departments is required to solve 
many practical difficulties facing major grain-producing 
households. We should decontrol land management rights in line 
with the principle of "voluntarism, compensation, and accordance 
with the law," while making sure that the system of household 
contract responsibility with remuneration linked to output 
remains unchanged. We should expand scientific farming, and 
scientific agricultural research units should actively exploit 
quality rice strains. All trades and professions should lend 
stronger support to the agricultural sector, and party and 
government leaders at all levels should also do solid work for 
that sector. 
  At the meeting, Wan Xueyuan and Liu Xirong warmly 
congratulated ZHEJIANG RIBAO on its 45th founding anniversary. 
After the meeting, they inspected the construction site of the 
ZHEJIANG RIBAO news building, and encouraged units in charge of 
construction and constructors to provide quality work and 
complete the key spiritual civilization construction project on 
time.

  [Text] This afternoon, Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau member and Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee 
secretary, met in Zhudao Hotel and held cordial talks with some 
locally based model workers. 
  Comrade Xie Fei said: Guangdong should strive to build a 
competent and high-quality contingent of workers, and advocate 
and develop five fine spirits, namely, the spirit of acting as 
masters of the country and the enterprise, the spirit of 
selfless devotion, the spirit of reform and innovation, the 
spirit of hard work, and the spirit of solidarity and mutual 
assistance. To this end, government departments concerned and 
trade unions at all levels across the province should show 
concern for the livelihood of workers and make every possible 
endeavor to help workers with difficulties in their daily lives 
overcome those difficulties. 
  Provincial leaders including [provincial Governor] Zhu 
Senlin, Zhang Guoying, Huang Huahua, Zhang Gaoli, Zhong Qiquan, 
and others were also present during the meeting.

  [Text] On 17-21 May, provincial Governor Zhu Senlin and 
relevant responsible persons of the provincial government went 
deep into grass-roots units in Zhaoqing city to find out about 
the situation in the city and listen to their opinions. They 
worked together with local leaders to study how to further grasp 
well the work of deepening and promoting reform and maintaining 
stability. 
  During the inspection tour, some enterprises raised the 
issue 
of rising of production costs due to the shortage of funds and 
price increases of raw and processed materials, which 
constrained economic development. Zhu Senlin stressed that they 
must mainly rely on their own efforts to overcome difficulties, 
and that they must adopt their own methods even if they make use 
of foreign capital, or speed up capital turnover. He affirmed 
the method employed by Zhaoqing city of expanding the base and 
making use of limited funds to ensure circulating funds for 
normal production, funds for developing agriculture and 
purchasing agricultural and sideline products, and funds for 
purchasing products to be exported.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 26 (XINHUA) -- This major financial 
center in southern China has reported one financial institution 
for every 3,000 residents thanks to the booming banking business. 
  Guangzhou has been listed as one of the five cities in China 
to experiment with financial reforms. To step up such reform, 
the city has worked hard to establish financial institutions and 
markets at various levels while developing the insurance market. 
  By the end of last year Guangzhou had established altogether 
2,100 financial institutions, among which eight are trust and 
investment companies, two are accounting firms and 43 are urban 
credit co-operatives set up only in the past few years. 
  Meanwhile, seven foreign banks have set up branches in this 
economically prospering city, and another 23 foreign banks have 
offices here. In addition, some 130 securities offices have 
been set up. 
  Now, the city boasts over 100 billion yuan in financial 
assets, leading all the other areas in southern China. By the 
end of last year Guangzhou had 99.5 billion yuan (about 11 
billion U.S. dollars) in bank savings accounts, an increase of 
24.33 percent over the previous year.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong Province, a 
pilot in reforms and opening up, scored a stable economic growth 
in the first four months of 1994, the provincial statistics 
bureau reported yesterday. 
  The province manufactured 115.9 billion yuan-worth of goods 
during the January-April period, up 19 percent from the same 
period in 1993, a bureau official said. 
  The market continued to be brisk, with retail sales soaring 
32.5 percent during that period to reach 51.9 billion yuan, he 
said. 
  Exports shot up 120 percent to 11.47 billion U.S. dollars in 
the first four months of this year. 
  Meanwhile, Guangdong attracted 3.19 billion dollars in 
overseas investment during this period, up nearly 37 percent 
from the same period in 1993. 
  The official listed the following figures to illustrate 
Guangdong's economic achievements during the January-April 
period: 
  -- The number of construction projects undertaken was 464 
fewer than in the same period of 1993 as a result of efforts to 
control excessive investment in fixed assets; 
  -- The amount of cargo transported climbed 28 percent to 
nearly 92 million tons; and 
  -- Electricity production shot up 42 percent to 21.4 billion 
kwh. 
  Furthermore, inflation has been curbed, the official said. 
  The increase in the price index rose 19.6 percent in April, 
five percentage points lower than in both March and February.

  [Text] Shenzhen, May 26 (XINHUA) -- About 93 percent of the 
foreign-funded enterprises in the Shekou industrial zone are 
profitable. 
  One of the first such windows for foreign investment, Shekou 
is located in south of China's Shenzhen economic zone in south 
China's Guangdong Province. 
  According to a senior official of the China Merchants 
Holdings Co. Ltd, licensed in Hong Kong, which has developed the 
fishing village into a modern industrial zone by attracting 
foreign investment over the past 15 years, Shekou has introduced 
700 million U.S. dollars for the establishment of nearly 400 
joint ventures or enterprises solely owned by foreign investors. 
  Enterprises in the red are can blame poor management or 
changes in the international market, he said. 
  Since the beginning of this year industrialists and 
representatives of multinationals from the U.S., Europe and 
Southeast Asian countries have been flocking to the industrial 
zone in search of better investment opportunities, he noted.

  [Text] Shenzhen, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Shenzhen, a special 
economic zone in south China's Guangdong Province, has built 
several power plants with a total generating capacity of more 
than two million kw in the past six years. 
  Since the city was approved as a special economic zone in 
1980, the booming economy and growing population of the city 
have required an expanding power supply. 
  In China, almost all large power plants were financed by the 
state in the past. But the city decided in 1987 to build power 
plants by itself, setting many favorable policies to encourage 
overseas and local investors. 
  At present, a thermal power plant with a generating capacity 
of 1.8 million kw is under construction. According to its power 
development program, the city will construct two more large 
power plants in the near future. 
  The program calls for the total generating capacity of the 
city's power plants to reach 6.35 million kw by the end of this 
century, to cover most of the city's power needs.

  [Text] Cheng Kejie, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Regional People's Government, and Ding Tingmo, deputy 
secretary of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional CPC 
Committee, gave separate interviews in Nanning on 18 and 19 May 
to a group of reporters from the capital. Cheng Kejie and Ding 
Tingmo made extensive comments to the reporters about the 
region's gratifying situation in reform, opening up, and 
economic construction. 
  On the whole, they said, the situation of Guangxi is this: 
The economy is developing, the political situation is stable, 
the nationalities are united, and the society is progressing. 
In the past few years, Guangxi's GNP has maintained a 
relatively high growth rate. The township and town enterprises 
have developed in a sustained and rapid manner, and their growth 
rate has been in the forefront in China for three years running. 
Agriculture has developed steadily, good harvests have been 
reaped for several successive years, and there has been marked 
progress in the construction of the infrastructure, such as 
transportation, telecommunications, and power. The momentum of 
development in a number of key construction projects is very 
good, and the pace of opening to the outside world has also been 
accelerated. The actual amount of foreign capital used has 
increased by a big margin as compared with the past. In 
addition, greater efforts have been made to help the poor. 
  Talking about why Guangxi has made gratifying achievements 
in 
reform, opening up, and economic construction, Cheng Kejie and 
Ding Tingmo said it is mainly because of the policies for 
Guangxi formulated by the central authorities. It is also the 
result of the concerted efforts of various trades and 
professions, party members and cadres at all levels, and people 
of all nationalities in Guangxi who are using Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as guidance for practice. 
  Cheng Kejie and Ding Tingmo hoped that the reporters would 
visit various localities in Guangxi, tell the public more about 
the region, and make valuable suggestions on the work there. 
  The group of reporters from the capital arrived in Nanning 
on 
18 May. The group consists of nine reporters from seven 
newspapers and magazines, including RENMIN RIBAO, ZHONGHUA 
YINGCAI HUABAO, LIAOWANG WEEKLY, CHINA DAILY, BEIJING REVIEW, 
and NONMING RIBAO. They will go to Nanning, Beihai, Fangcheng 
Port, Yulin, Hechi, Liuzhou, and Guilin to report on what they 
see, and spend half a month on the road.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, Governor Ruan Chongwu presided 
over the 34th executive meeting of the provincial government, 
which examined and adopted in principle Hainan's 
help-the-poor-through-development program, whose goal it is to 
solve the problem of food and clothing for people in the 
impoverished areas by the end of this century, and Hainan's 
detailed rules and regulations of implementation concerning the 
management of family planning work among the floating 
population. Present at the meeting were Vice Governors Wang 
Xueping, Chen Suhou, and Liu Mingqi, as well as Liu Xuebin, 
Standing Committee member of the provincial party committee and 
special assistant to the governor. Persons in charge of 
relevant government departments attended the meeting as 
nonvoting delegates. 
  Since the founding of Hainan Province and the establishment 
of the Hainan Special Economic Zone, Hainan's economy has 
developed rapidly and its work to help the poor has made 
relatively great progress, with over 1.1 million people having 
managed to shake off poverty. Nevertheless, as our province has 
a weak foundation for development and development varies from 
locality to locality, the task is still very arduous. To speed 
up the pace of shaking off poverty and achieving common 
prosperity in the rural areas, the provincial government has 
decided to spend seven years (1994-2000) to reach the goal of 
raising the rural areas out of poverty. Governments at all 
levels and departments were urged to regard the help-the-poor 
work as part of their work, make concerted efforts, do solid 
work, and contribute to the realization of the help-the-poor- 
through-development program. 
  This year our province has registered a drastic increase in 
the floating population, and the number of births outside the 
state plan among the floating population has reached serious 
proportions. According to the state's family planning management 
methods and the requirements of Hainan's family planning 
regulations, the provincial government has formulated and will 
promulgate Hainan Province's detailed rules and regulations of 
implementation concerning the management of family planning 
among the floating population, so as to effectively manage 
family planning work among the floating population.

  [Text] Haikou, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Hainan, an island 
province with a fledgling industrial foundation, is stepping up 
its efforts in the construction of industrial parks so as to 
inject new vitality into this largest special economic zone in 
China. 
  So far, Hainan has built over 40 industrial parks with a 
planned investment of 16.8 billion yuan (about 1.9 billion U.S. 
dollars) since it was established as a province six years ago. 
  At present, some 200 construction projects are underway in 
these industrial parks. 
  Under construction are projects involving machine building, 
electronics, light and textile industry, and pharmaceuticals. 
These projects are expected to add two billion yuan in output 
value and 100 million U.S. dollars in export earnings. 
  In 1993 the province's industrial output value surpassed 
that 
of agriculture for the first time in history, turning out 10 
billion yuan-worth of products. Industrial parks have played 
important roles in this respect. 
  Drawing experience from Singapore, the Republic of Korea, 
Japan and Hong Kong, Hainan is concentrating on large-scale 
industrial production, especially by making use of its rich 
offshore resources, said Wang Xiaofeng, deputy governor of the 
province. 
  Tourism, processing and transportation as well as 
high-value-added tropical agriculture will form the backbone of 
Hainan's industry, he added.

  [Text] On the morning of 16 May, the Hubei provincial 
economic delegation held a news briefing in Europe's triangle 
region -- Germany's Saarland, France's Lorraine, and the city of 
Saarlouis in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg --and, at the same 
time, a seminar in the city of Ludwigsburg in the Ruhr Valley 
industrial area, which is situated in west-central Germany. 
Over 200 entrepreneurs and bankers were invited to attend the 
two gatherings to hear about Hubei's economic and technological 
cooperation projects. 
  In the city of Saarlouis, while systematically expounding on 
the various methods taken to absorb foreign capital, Comrade 
Guan Guangfu said: China's reform and opening up to the outside 
world is irreversible, like the earth revolving round the sun, 
and its determination to link its economy with the world economy 
is unshakable. China's economy is moving into the orbit of 
sustained, steady, and healthy growth. China is both the 
world's largest construction site and market. Although Hubei is 
not the largest province in China, it is one of the provinces 
with the greatest potential for development. Those who are the 
first to go and invest in China and Hubei will be the first to 
reap benefits. 
  After the news briefing, which was held in the city of 
Saarlouis, Guan Guangfu and other comrades attended the signing 
ceremony for the $80-million agreements concluded by our 
province with three German companies and one French company. 
  In the city of Ludwigsburg, Wuhan Vice Mayor (Wu Houfu) 
briefed seminar participants on Wuhan City's investment 
environment and development plan and reviewed the close ties 
between Wuhan and Ludwigsburg. Stressing the role of Wuhan, one 
of the exceptionally big cities in China, as a dragon head in 
the Chang Jiang Economic Belt and Hubei Province, he said: 
Wuhan City is the center of China's inland market. Our 
delegation brings along close to 200 economic and technological 
cooperation projects requiring a total investment of 
approximately $1.5 billion. After the seminar, German bankers 
and entrepreneurs held discussions with the Wuhan delegation on 
the specific ways of cooperation and signed 19 letters of intent 
involving a total investment of about $200 million.

  [Text] On the morning of 17 May, at the invitation of 
Germany's Saarland Parliament and Saarland Government, Comrade 
Guan Guangfu [provincial party committee secretary], leader of 
the visiting Hubei Provincial Economic Delegation, held talks 
with Saarland Parliament Leader (Helwig) [he lu yi de] and 
Saarland Governor (Larsonden) [la song dan] on separate 
occasions. The two sides held discussions on issues relating to 
continued bilateral cooperation in an extremely friendly 
atmosphere. Comrade Mei Xiaorong, Chinese ambassador to 
Germany, was also present during the talks. 
  During his talks with the Saarland Parliament leader and the 
Saarland governor, Comrade Guan Guangfu said: The Three Gorges 
Project, a world-renowned project being built on the Changjiang, 
and the 1,065-kilometer-long Changjiang Gold Channel, a project 
being built in Hubei, have created new opportunities in Hubei. 
Now is the best moment in Hubei's economic development, as 
Hubei is becoming one of China's most dynamic regions for 
foreign investment. 
  Comrade Guan Guangfu said: Hubei's new train of thought for 
reform and opening up is as follows: To consolidate the 
existing relations of cooperation with Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Taiwan and expand relations of cooperation with Europe, the 
United States, and Japan. At present, Hubei is attaching the 
greatest importance to closer relations of cooperation with West 
European countries. 
  This is primarily due to the following four reasons: 1) 
Europe, the United States, and Japan are the most economically 
developed countries and regions in the world. Only by 
strengthening relations of cooperation with the most 
economically developed countries and regions will we be able to 
learn more new things; 2) Europe, the United States, and Japan 
are known for their enormous funds as well as advanced science 
and technology. Nevertheless, these countries and regions are 
now bogged down in an economic quagmire. If they choose to make 
investments in and transfer technology to China, both sides will 
benefit; 
  3) Developing economic cooperation with Europe, the United 
States, and Japan has remained to date the only way of 
accelerating China's reform and opening up and linking China's 
economy with the international economy; and 4) International 
economic development and civilization are always an objective 
reality independent of man's will. The interdependence among 
various countries and regions is the motivating force for 
development worldwide and progress, which are constantly 
propelled by hi-tech development and speedy information 
proliferation. 
  Governor (Larsonden) and Parliament Leader (Helwig) agreed 
with Comrade Guan Guangfu, saying: Your friendly visit is bound 
to further promote more substantive bilateral cooperation 
between Hubei and Saarland. There are still many areas in which 
Hubei and Saarland can complement each other; for example, Hubei 
is much better than Saarland in respect of using inferior coal 
to generate electricity and in manufacturing auto spare parts. 
We are very willing to cooperate with Hubei in this regard. 
Governor (Larsonden) also laid special emphasis on cultural and 
artistic cooperation and exchanges between Hubei and Saarland. 
  Hubei Province and Germany's Saarland signed an economic and 
technological cooperation agreement in 1986. Over the past 
eight years, the two sides have carried out some exchanges and 
must do more in this area in the future. The two sides pledged 
to join hands in opening up new vistas for more substantive 
bilateral cooperation in economic, technological, and other 
fields after the visit.

of the militia unit dealing with contingencies in the provincial 
capital Changsha. The unit staged report-back performances of 
military training such as enemy-subduing boxing, skill in using 
clubs, and unarmed combat to mark the anniversary. Established 
to meet contingency needs with maintaining social stability and 
protecting the people's peaceful labor as the guidelines, the 
unit has made positive contributions to Changsha's reform and 
opening up to the outside world. 
  In July last year, Changsha's urban and rural areas were 
universally hit by floods and waterlogging. Over 1,000 dams, 
mountain embankments, and reservoirs were in danger and 1 
million mu of paddy fields was submerged. Ordered by the 
Changsha Garrison Command, all militiamen of the unit pitched 
into the work, guarding dams, plugging breaches, and rushing to 
save the people's lives and property. They successively saved 
more than 30,000 people who were marooned by flood waters and 
over 700 tonnes of goods and materials. 
  The unit has also played the role of a shock force. This 
year the unit has dispatched its members in more than 300,000 
individual instances to take part in the construction of key 
development projects such as the Xiang Jiang 100-li flood 
control embankment and (Furong) Road, thus yielding impressive 
economic results. The unit has also repeatedly made 
contributions to maintaining social security. 
  Yesterday, provincial and city party, government, and Army 
leaders [provincial Secretary] Wang Maolin, [provincial military 
district Commander] Pang Weiqiang, (Wu Xiangdong), Shen Ruiting, 
and Tang Zhixiang watched the unit's performances of military 
training and reviewed the unit.

  [Text] Yesterday [19 May] evening, provincial CPC 
Committee held a televised telephone meeting for responsible 
persons of various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, cities, 
and counties as well as units directly under provincial 
authorities to further mobilize and make arrangements for 
convening democratic life meeting of the CPC Committees and 
leading party groups in units at and above county level aimed at 
promoting cleanness, honesty and self- discipline. The meeting 
was presided over by Chen Bangzhu, provincial party deputy 
secretary and governor. Provincial party Secretary Wang Maolin 
made an important speech. Yang Minzhi, member of the provincial 
CPC Committee and secretary of the provincial Discipline 
Inspection Commission, read a document issued by the provincial 
Discipline Inspection Commission and provincial Organization 
Department, and approved and relayed by the provincial CPC 
Committee, on a proposal to convene well democratic life 
meetings of the CPC Committees and leading party groups in units 
at and above the county level. 
  The meeting demanded that during the first half of this year 
democratic life meetings of the CPC Committees and leading party 
groups in units at and above the county level be more 
meticulously organized than last year, that higher demands be 
set on them, and that problems be solved in a more practical and 
effective way. Relevant units must right away carry out 
self-examination and self-appraisal strictly in accordance with 
the requirements of the CPC Central Committee to strive to solve 
well the main problems of members of the leading bodies before 
the democratic life meetings to be held at the end of June or 
early July. 
  In his speech, Comrade Wang Maolin called on those persons 
having primary responsibility in party and government organs at 
all levels to understand the importance of the democratic life 
meetings for leading cadres aimed at promoting clearness, 
honesty and self-discipline from the high plane of implementing 
the measures of the central authorities of opposing corruption, 
forging closer links between the party and the masses, enhancing 
combat effectiveness of leading bodies, and promoting reform, 
development, and stability. Democratic life meetings must be 
convened in a conscientious and serious manner. As far as the 
whole province is concerned, in accordance with the requirements 
of the two five-point principles set and reiterated by the 
central authorities for ensuring leading cadres' cleanness and 
honesty, we must truly solve several prominent problems existing 
in a small number of leading cadres, such as seeking personal 
ease and comfort, abusing power for private gains, accepting as 
gifts red envelopes containing money, being showy, and 
practicing fraud. 
  Comrade Wang Maolin pointed out: Since the situations in 
various localities and units are different, they must proceed 
from their own practical conditions to solve their own problems 
whenever they occur. Those persons holding primary 
responsibility in the party and government organs at all levels 
must take lead in making self-examination right away. In the 
meantime, the must be bold in conducting conscientious and 
serious criticisms to educate and help a number of people so 
that they can enhance their understanding and solve their own 
problems. 
  Those who attended the above-mentioned televised telephone 
meeting in the main meeting hall included members of the 
provincial CPC Committee Standing Committee, party-member 
chairman and vice chairmen of the provincial People's Congress, 
vice governors of the provincial government, party-member 
chairman and vice chairmen of the provincial Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, secretaries of the CPC 
Committees and leading party groups in various units directly 
under provincial authorities, and chiefs or secretaries of 
Discipline Inspection Commissions, as well as responsible 
comrades of Changsha city and area. Members of the Prefectural, 
Autonomous Prefectural, city, and county CPC Committees Standing 
Committees attended the meeting in meeting rooms of local postal 
and telecommunications offices.

  [Text] Accompanied by provincial vice Governor Zheng 
Peimin and provincial education commission Director Ji Yihui, 
provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin inspected five 
locally based higher learning institutions on 18-21 May, 
including Central South University of Technology, Hunan 
Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hunan Teachers' 
University, Changsha Institute of Communications, and Hunan 
Light Industry School. 
  During his inspection, Secretary Wang Maolin inspected in 
great detail internal and external environments of each and 
every higher learning institution, inquired about conditions in 
student dormitories and canteens, befriended and solicited views 
from students, and showed great concern for teaching, learning, 
and scientific research activities, teachers' contingent 
building, as well as ideological realities, livelihood, academic 
and research work of staff and teachers. 
  After being told that many locally based higher learning 
institutions are confronted with difficulties in scientific 
research and publication of literary works due to a short supply 
of water, electricity, and operational funds, Secretary Wang 
Maolin repeatedly asked the provincial education commission, 
provincial party committee's college education work committee, 
and some other provincial departments concerned to take prompt 
action to resolve those problems as soon as possible. 
  During his inspection, Secretary Wang Maolin time and again 
stressed: Now the majority of the province's college students 
are in their twenties and are thereby the unquestionable 
successors in the next century. Within a short space of 10 to 
20 years, these students will become either party and government 
leaders at all levels across the country or technological 
backbones in the forefront of production. Therefore, higher 
learning institutions should at once be places where students 
are trained academically and where students are taught how to 
conduct themselves. Only by so doing will they be able to train 
a new generation of people capable of undertaking sacred 
missions entrusted by history. 
  During his inspection, Secretary Wang Maolin highly praised 
Central South University of Technology for having successfully 
built a national-level laboratory and a powder metallurgy 
research institute, praised Hunan Teachers' University for 
having built a competent contingent of teachers and trained a 
large number of highly qualified personnel, praised Hunan 
Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine for having 
successfully developed a traditional Chinese medical diagnoses 
course, praised Changsha Institute of Communications for having 
cultivated a fine campus style and a fine academic style, and 
commended Hunan Light Industry School for having successfully 
created and experimented with a series of new teaching methods. 
  Secretary Wang Maolin also spelled out some specific new 
work 
requirements for the aforementioned five higher learning 
institutions.

  [Text] Guiyang, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Guizhou Province has completed construction of a "drinking water 
project" for 1.06 million farmers and 500,000 cattle in 17 
counties. 
  The project consists of 358 drinking water works funded with 
the Japanese Government loans. 
  In the past, half of the farmers of Guizhou, a province 
situated on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, faced difficulties in 
drawing potable water from underground water sources. 
  In April 1991, the Chinese and Japanese Governments signed 
an 
agreement on using 1.5 billion yen to open up underground water 
reserves in Guizhou Province. 
  Zhang Yuqin, deputy governor of Guizhou Province, said that 
by the end of March this year, the projects were all completed. 
  She said that the Japanese-funded drinking water project has 
also prompted Guizhou to improve the quality of drinking water 
supplies and now more than 12.3 million farmers have access to 
clean water. 
  She said that this year, about 1.1 million additional 
farmers 
will have piped-in tap water.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporters Liu Wei (0491 0251) and He </F>
Guanghua (6320 1639 5478): "Looking at Tibet in a New Light"] 
  [Text] Whenever one mentions Tibet, one usually associates 
it with backwardness, with being closed, and with barrenness. 
Foreigners would rephrase it by calling it the "world's last 
Shangri-la," which means the same thing. However, the reality 
is totally different: This "roof of the world" amid reform and 
opening up has unprecedented vigor and vitality and has in store 
formidable hopes and prospects..... 
  At one time, Tibet was considered the "rear" of China's 
reform and opening up. 
  No wonder. The blueprint for the 1990's drawn up by Tibetans 
themselves does not seem to aim high. It fixes the annual 
average growth rate at only approximately 5.8 percent. Of 
course, it has difficulties which outsiders have difficulty 
understanding. The "blood-transfusion" economy consistently 
pursued over the past 40 years alone is a high wall that 
destines Tibet to have a very, very long way to go for its 
economic development, not to mention the contradiction between 
the gradually decreasing farmland and the drastically increasing 
population and the numerous restrictive factors such as 
communications, energy, and population quality. 
  But this is no reason for Tibet to be content with the 
present situation and not to think of making progress. 
  After the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's remarks during his 
southern tour was relayed to the ice-capped plateau in early 
1992, Tibetans could no longer remain calm. They began to ask 
themselves: Can Tibet remain "special" forever and continue to 
depend on the state's long-term "blood transfusions"? Is Tibet 
willing to accept the label of "being special" and stand at the 
rear of reform and opening up? 
  Backwardness is not terrifying. Being geographically closed 
is not terrifying. What is terrifying is rigid and conservative 
thinking and the psychology of idleness. Since April 1992, a 
big discussion on "changing the way of thinking and finding out 
about the difference," which involved everyone on the plateau, 
began in this context. 
  By transforming the "rear" into the "forefront" facing South 
Asia and changing an advantage in resources into an economic 
advantage, Tibetans this time seized the opportunity to increase 
the extent of reform and strive to develop in pace with the 
national economy. 
  At the beginning of July 1992, Tibet introduced a series of 
policies and regulations, including those intended to "deepen 
reform and increase the degree of openness," "encourage 
investment in Tibet from abroad and at home," and quicken the 
development of tertiary industry and township and town 
enterprises. In mid-July, the ports of Tibet's Burang and 
India's Gongci open and close at the same hours. The Yamarong 
Border Trade Fair, which had been suspended for 33 years, and 
other traditional border markets were restored. In August, 
Tibet announced 19 projects to attract a total investment of 
over 4 billion yuan. It also set up an office for attracting 
investment from abroad and at home. Afterward, border-trade and 
export-oriented economic development zones were set up in 10 
counties and ports on the Tibetan border. In September, 
large-scale economic and trade talks between Tibet and Nepal 
solemnly opened in Lhasa..... 
  With its unprecedented high efficiency, quick tempo, and new 
attitude, the "roof of the world" made the world see it in a new 
light. 
  That summer, an unprecedented market wave swept across 
Tibet. 
In Lhasa, the barriers of government organs on Linguo Road, 
Beijing Road, and Jinzhu Road were all pulled down almost 
overnight. Half a month later, a metals market was set up on 
Linguo Road and Beijing Road was changed into a street of 
clothes shops, and deluxe restaurants and hotels were found on 
west Beijing road. According to the Lhasa Bureau of Industry 
and Commerce, in the June-July period alone, over 500 individual 
industrial and commercial entrepreneurs were added, almost 10 
percent of the city's total individual and commercial 
entrepreneurs. Several bustling commercial streets were also 
found in such central cities and towns as Xigaze and Zetang. 
  Furthermore, local governments introduced "economic and 
trade" contents to the numerous ethnic traditional festivals in 
the summer and autumn of that year, such as Lhasa's Xuedun 
festival, Gyangze's Dama festival, Nagqu's Horse-Racing 
festival, Shannan's Yalong Cultural Festival, and Nyingchi's 
Spring Festival. At the same time, they also held trade fairs 
of different scales so that the Tibetan peasants and herdsmen 
could experience a new way of spending the festivals. 
  In the meantime, governments at all levels in Tibet have 
introduced preferential policies, set aside special funds, 
quickened market development, and shifted their attention from 
the previous trade fairs to all types of multifunction, 
multilayer, and multiform special markets. In this connection, 
real estate development, capital, labor service, and 
old-clothing markets have come into being. Transactions in the 
timber, grain, and fruit markets have become brisker. What is 
heartening is that peasants and herdsmen have begun to appear in 
the market arena. A special market has been set up in Lhasa 
specifically for peasants and herdsmen coming into the city to 
do business. Today, Lhasa people are beginning to speculate on 
stocks now that the Lhasa Securities Exchange has been put into 
operation. 
  Over the past two years, Tibet's national economy has 
developed at a higher growth rate each year. As far as its GNP 
is concerned, it was 2.535 billion yuan in 1991, 3.27 billion 
yuan in 1992, and 3.65 billion yuan in 1993. Calculated at 
comparable prices, these figures were 3.7 percent, 7.1 percent, 
and 8.1 percent higher respectively than in the previous year.

  [Text] Beijing, 6 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the 
spring of this year, epidemic diseases have increased 
dramatically in Yunnan Province, with measles occurring in some 
remote counties and townships. 
  Several days ago, the Yunnan Provincial People's Government 
and the Yunnan Provincial Health Department held an emergency 
telephone meeting on preventing the spread of epidemic diseases. 
The meeting instructed all levels of governments and health 
administrative departments to take measures and strengthen 
epidemic preventive work. 
  According to a JIANKANG BAO [Health Newspaper] report, there 
have been emergency occurrences of many epidemic diseases, with 
a very high death rate. The main reason is that preventive work 
is not effective and there are no methods to promptly control 
the spread of epidemics. 
  The Yunnan Provincial Government has asked governments at 
all 
levels to speedily ensure funding for epidemic preventive work, 
to promptly collect information on epidemics, and to ensure the 
supply of preventive medicine, remedial medicine, emergency 
biological products, disinfectants, insecticides, and all kinds 
of relief goods, so that measures can be immediately taken to 
control the spread of epidemics at the first signs of an 
outbreak.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will introduce 
foreign funds to speed up the construction of top-priority 
infrastructure projects, according to Mayor Li Qiyan. 
  These projects include a subway, a number of expressways, 
waste water treatment systems and the pulldown of dilapidated 
houses to build new residential areas, he said after visiting 
four cities -- Vienna, Paris, Berlin and Cologne earlier this 
month. 
  "Only by drawing on all outstanding achievements in human 
civilization will it be possible for Beijing to grow faster," he 
said. 
  He also pledged to draw on successful experience in urban 
construction of the four cities in order to turn Beijing into a 
"modern international metropolis" as soon as possible. 
  He recalled that during his meetings with German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and Austrian Chancellor Franz Vrantzky, the two 
chancellors expressed full support for the expansion of 
cooperation between the Chinese capital and the capitals of 
Germany and Austria. 
  Meanwhile, mayors of the four cities also pledged to expand 
cooperation with Beijing in science, technology, economy and 
culture, he said. 
  Beijing signed nine cooperation agreements with companies in 
France and Germany during the mayor's visit, involving a total 
investment of nearly 300 million U.S. dollars, he said. 
  Under these agreements, companies in Beijing and their 
counterparts in France and Germany will co-produce cans, machine 
tools, electrical appliances, pharmaceuticals and adhesives. 
  Government statistics show that Germany, France and Austria 
have invested 270 million U.S. dollars in 138 joint ventures in 
Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Beijing has recently 
issued a set of regulations on the prevention and control of 
occupational diseases. 
  Statistics show that in 1993, over 525,000 workers came into 
contact with poisonous material leaks in more than 13,400 
factories and enterprises in the city. 
  According to a 1993 survey, nearly 2000 people have 
contracted with diseases caused by their work each year, an 
annual incidence rate of 1.3 percent. 
  The new rules require new projects to meet hygienic 
standards 
set by the state. It also emphasizes the prevention measures. 
  The regulations define the responsibilities which relevant 
departments should assume, such as diagnosis of and supervision 
over occupational diseases. 
  Problems still exist in the city's 1,500 foreign-funded 
enterprises. 
  Some companies have introduced production equipment but not 
the corresponding safety facilities to prevent poisons in 
workshops from doing serious harm to workers' health. 
  Some foreign businessmen, under the guise of maintaining 
company security, do not disclose the chemical compositions of 
prescriptions which contain harmful materials. 
  Several materials which have been banned or replaced by 
substitutes abroad are still used in some Chinese joint ventures.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The Standing Committee 
of the Beijing municipal people's congress has just issued a set 
of new regulations for the implementation of China's Law on the 
Protection of Women's Rights and Interests. 
  The law was adopted by the Standing Committee of the 
National 
People's Congress in April 1992. 
  Wu Xiuping, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal 
Commission for Protecting Women's Rights and Interests, said 
that the 53- article regulations cover women's political rights, 
their rights in culture and education, their work rights and 
interests, their rights of person, marriage and family, and 
legal liabilities. 
  She said the regulations also specify the names and duties 
of 
agencies in charge of protecting women's rights and interests. 
  The regulations state that except for special cases, no 
employer may refuse to hire women. 
  Moreover, no enterprises may discriminate against women 
while 
carrying out the labor reform and transforming their operational 
mechanism. 
  The regulations ban insulting, beating and maltreatment of 
female members of a family, and the abduction, kidnapping, 
selling and buying of women, as well as prostitution. 
  No hotels, dance halls, bars, cafes or beauty shops may 
facilitate prostitution or provide sex services. 
  Wu Xiuping said that half of the 10.5 million residents in 
Beijing are women. 
  At the end of 1993, Beijing had 368,000 women government 
employees, 44.5 percent of the total. 
  Nearly 12 percent of the leading officials at the 
prefectural 
commissioner's level and 22 percent of those at the county 
magistrate's level are women, she said. 
  Women now account for nearly 52 percent of technicians and 
engineers in state-owned businesses and institutions. 
  She said that 33 percent of the representatives of the 
municipal people's congress are women, she said, adding that 
also about 26 percent of the representatives of the people's 
congress at the county and district level are women. 
  She also acknowledged a number of problems in bringing the 
role of women into full play. 
  For example, the ratio of women among leading officials is 
too low and woman college graduates find it relatively difficult 
to get jobs.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- Since its inception a 
year ago, the Beijing Copyright Protection Association, the 
country's first local copyright protection organization, has 
achieved tremendous success in actively protecting the 
legitimate rights and interests of copyright holders, in 
extensively publicizing and popularizing the Copyright Law, and 
in encouraging people in all sectors of society to participate 
in copyright management and protection. 
  Since its founding, the Beijing Copyright Protection 
Association has focused on publicizing and popularizing the 
Copyright Law. In March 1993, the association organized 
training on the "Universal Copyright Convention and copyright 
management" for people in charge of copyright-related work from 
more than 60 publishing houses and press offices in Beijing, 
thus enabling them to gain a preliminary knowledge and 
understanding of the Universal Copyright Convention, and thus 
laying a fairly sound foundation for copyright management organs 
to exercise their duties in accordance with the law. The 
Beijing Copyright Protection Association also has organized many 
forums regarding the Copyright Law for artists and renowned 
writers in Beijing, and it has launched publicity and 
consultation services regarding the Copyright Law in Beijing's 
main streets and public places. This has facilitated Beijing's 
enforcement of the Copyright Law. 
  The Beijing Copyright Protection Association has provided 
services for copyright protection and has carried out 
explorations and experiments in copyright agency services. Last 
September, the Beijing Copyright Protection Association and the 
Beijing Copyright Bureau held the first trade fair on book 
manuscripts, thus serving as a bridge between writers and 
publishers. Nine publishing agreements and 30 letters of intent 
on publishing were concluded, and approximately 300,000 yuan 
worth of business was conducted. The fair won universal acclaim 
from writers and publishers. The Beijing Copyright Protection 
Association also has actively investigated piracy and other 
infringements on behalf of copyright holders. In 1993, the 
association sent its members to Heilongjiang Province, Hebei 
Province, Tianjin municipality, and Shanxi Province to 
investigate the piracy of "The Gourd Brothers," a book published 
by the China Film Press. It helped the publishers recoup part 
of their economic losses. 
  The Beijing Copyright Protection Association also has made 
active efforts to mediate copyright disputes. A publishing 
house in Beijing had a dispute with the heir of an author, and 
the dispute remained unresolved for several years. Last year, 
the Beijing Copyright Protection Association mediated the 
dispute at the request of both parties and quickly solved it. 
According to the feedback of many publishers and writers in 
Beijing municipality, the civilian mediation process employed by 
the Beijing Copyright Protection Association regarding copyright 
disputes is simple, is unlikely to provoke hard feelings, and is 
economically acceptable. 
  After more than a year of exploration and practice, the 
Beijing Copyright Protection Association has inducted most of 
the publishers and a number of writers in the Beijing area, 
thereby initially installing a collective management mechanism 
for copyright management in the Beijing area.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Three counties in 
the Taihangshan Mountain Region of north China's Hebei Province 
have launched a campaign to auction the right of use of barren 
hills in a bid to effectively implement one of China's 
afforestation projects. 
  Also under auction are barren valleys, wastelands and 
uncultivated mountain slopes. 
  China's land law stipulates that all land, including 
mountains and rivers, is state property. Therefore, what has 
been auctioned is the right to explore the undeveloped areas. 
Underground minerals, however, are excluded. 
  Hebei provincial sources said that Zhanhuang County has sold 
the right of use for some 11,000 ha [hectares] of uncultivated 
areas, more than 60 percent of the county's total such areas. 
Pingshan and Tangxian Counties have ``auctioned" off another 
11,600 ha of such areas. 
  The Taihangshan Mountain Range, winding through 110 
counties, 
cities and districts in Hebei, Henan and Shanxi Provinces and 
Beijing, has a mountainous area of more than 12 million ha. The 
Taihangshan Mountain Afforestation Project, one of China's 
largest afforestation projects in full swing, has been written 
into the "21st Century Agenda of China". 
  According to the project, by the year 2000 the total green 
area in the Taihangshan Mountain Region is projected to top nine 
million ha and the forest cover rate there will climb from the 
current 18.1 percent to 43.6 percent. 
  The three counties have promulgated a set of policies 
stating 
that all capable individuals, enterprises, institutions and 
departments can participate in the bidding for the right to 
develop barren areas, either individually or jointly. 
  According to the policies, which set no limitations on the 
area of land a bidder can offer to buy, the auctioned barren 
areas can be inherited, leased or transferred before the auction 
contracts expire. 
  They also stipulate that the bidding winners must strive to 
achieve the initial afforestation target set down by related 
departments for the first three to five years. Otherwise, the 
auction deal will be invalidated and the areas covered by the 
contracts re-auctioned. 
  An official at the Forestry Department of Hebei Province 
said 
that the auction of the right of use of barren areas is an 
experimental reform measure that has a direct bearing on 
agricultural property rights relations in the countryside as 
well as on the interests of farmers. 
  He added that the reform is also a bold experiment to 
integrate the land with the market. 
  The official said that the long-term limit applied to 
auction 
deals, generally ranging from 30 to 70 years, has helped form a 
direct and stable relationship between investment and economic 
returns. 
  This has triggered farmers' enthusiasm to channel more money 
and labor into improving the uncultivated areas, he said, adding 
that in the places where the reform measure has been introduced, 
economic and social benefits have become obvious. 
  Qin Wenping, Forestry Bureau director of Zhanhuang County, 
said that since the county first started auctioning the right of 
use of undeveloped areas in 1990, the county's forest cover rate 
has risen from 13.7 percent to 20.4 percent. 
  He also said that the county's annual output of fruit has 
doubled to 20 million kg and per capita income increased by some 
1000 yuan (more than 120 U.S. dollars). 
  Official sources said that the auction practice has also 
been 
started in Henan, Shanxi and Liaoning Provinces.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The Jingtang Port 
in Hebei Province will be built jointly by Beijing and Tangshan 
into an international port city by the end of the century, a 
port official said today. 
  The official said that Jingtang Port, or the 
Beijing-Tangshan 
Port, is designed to handle 6.5 million tons of cargo annually 
by the end of 1995. 
  The port's handling capacity will rise to 12 million tons a 
year by 2000, he added. 
  In July 1993, Tangshan, a major coal mining and 
manufacturing 
center in north China, signed an agreement with Beijing to 
jointly build the new port in Wangtan Township, Leting County. 
  The port, 95 kilometers southeast of Tangshan, opened to 
foreign ships on July 18, 1993, he said. 
  The Tangshan City Government is building a 44-sq-km 
development zone around the port, he said. 
  A 77-km railway now links the port to the 
Beijing-Shanhaiguan 
Railway Line, he said, adding that direct dialing service to the 
rest of China and the world is available in Jingtang. 
  The Tangshan City Government has decided to focus on the 
growth of transportation, processing and high-tech industries in 
the development zone, he said. 
  To date, the port authorities have approved the undertaking 
of 93 projects in the zone in cooperation with Chinese and 
overseas firms, he said, adding that these projects will involve 
1.7 billion yuan in total investment. 
  Work has started on nine projects, including a seamen's 
hotel 
and an office building, he said. 
  Jingtang is set to increase its population to 300,000 by the 
end of the century, he said.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Hebei Plant Fined for Dumping Toxic Waste"] </F>
  [Text] In the most serious environmental case in Hebei, 
provincial officials have fined a chemical factory 90,000 yuan 
($10,300) for discharging toxic waste. 
  The No 5 Chemical Factory under the Applied Chemical Company 
in Langfang, a city between Beijing and Tianjin, is also likely 
to be brought to court and forced to pay compensation to victims 
of the waste dumping. 
  The factory has until June 5 to pay the fine, said Wang 
Junhe, director of the provincial environmental protection 
bureau. 
  Local officials discovered in February that the factory had 
dumped 227 drums of phosphorus sulfide along mountains in Hebei 
Province and into rivers in Tianjin municipality. 
  Each barrel contained 1OO kilograms of the poisonous 
chemicals. 
  The first 20 drums were uncovered on February 22 in the Ziya 
River in Tianjin's Xiqing District--a major source of drinking 
water for residents. 
  The local government immediately channeled river water to 
the 
Luanhe River to clean up the contaminated Ziya. No cases of 
water poisoning were reported. 
  Another 33 drums of waste were uncovered in the rivers and 
irrigation canals in Wuqing county, Tianjin. 
  Wang said the local government is preparing to sue the 
director and vice directors responsible. 
  It is estimated compensation to local residents could be 
more 
than 1 million yuan ($114,000).

  [Text] Hohhot, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region has benefited from the country's open policy 
as the region reported a marked increase last year in overseas 
investment and foreign trade, especially border trade, a 
regional official said today. 
  Inner Mongolia has 4,200 km of border with Russia and 
Mongolia, and 18 trading ports along the border. In 1993 border 
trade between the region and the two adjoining countries reached 
770 million U.S. dollars-worth, an increase of 67.2 percent or 
64 percent of the region's total foreign trade volume. 
  The region attracted 360 million U.S. dollars in foreign 
investment in 408 joint ventures in 1993, an increase of 1.2 
times over the previous year. It has also signed over 1,000 
co-operation projects with other provinces and municipalities. 
  To enhance its economic development, Inner Mongolia has 
established a number of enterprise groups which involve in 
domestic and foreign trade and technological exchanges. The 
region established 83 joint ventures overseas and invested in 
another 130 overseas projects. 
  So far, the region has signed over 600 million Swiss 
francs-worth of contracts with Russia and Mongolia concerning 
construction, export of labor and technological exchanges. Over 
30,000 residents of Inner Mongolia are working overseas to 
fulfil these contracts. 
  To expand trade relations with the outside world the region 
has set up 68 representative offices in the Commonwealth of 
Independent Countries, the Republic of Mongolia and Eastern 
European countries, a regional official said.

  [Text] Taiyuan, 9 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According to 
the environmental protection work meeting of Shanxi Province 
which was held a few days ago, environmental pollution in the 
province has been very serious. With the exception of the six 
cities directly under the provincial government, which have 
managed to initially check the spreading contamination of the 
atmosphere and surface water, the ecology of medium-sized and 
small cities in the province is being increasingly disturbed, 
and environmental pollution in some villages and towns is 
worsening. 
  Shanxi is China's energy and heavy and chemical industrial 
base. The province produces approximately 290 million tonnes of 
coal a year, and its consumption of coal increases at a rate of 
about 10 percent a year. At the same time, it releases 1 
million tonnes of soot and 900,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a 
year. These objective factors cast a shadow over Shanxi's 
already seriously polluted environment. 
  The results of the monitoring of the quality of the 
atmospheric environment of 17 cities in the province show: The 
daily average value [zhi 0237] density of suspended particles 
over the year is 216 to 833 micrograms per cubic meter, 
surpassing the state's grade- 2 standard of atmospheric 
environmental quality. The figure for some major cities of the 
province is 130 percent higher than that for the cities in north 
China. 
  The results of the monitoring of the 11 major rivers and 
their tributaries in the province show: Although the major 
rivers have not yet been contaminated, the river sections whose 
waters are good for drinking and industrial and agricultural 
purposes are very few, and 85 percent of the river sections are 
contaminated to varying degrees. The sources of drinking water 
and its quality in many cities have thus been adversely affected. 
  This grim situation has attracted great attention from the 
province's environmental departments. They expressed readiness 
to take an active part in comprehensive decisionmaking, to 
strengthen the building of the legal system, and to strive to 
urge the provincial people's congress to promulgate before 1997 
the "Regulations of Shanxi Province on Environmental 
Protection," the "Regulations of Shanxi Province on Prevention 
and Control of Atmospheric Pollution," and relevant 
administrative rules and standards.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin is striving to 
upgrade all its state-owned enterprises with foreign funds in 
less than eight years, said a senior city leader here today. 
  Mayor Zhang Lichang disclosed this before the opening of the 
'94 Tianjin Export Commodity Fair tomorrow here in this, north 
China's biggest port city. 
  More than 300 overseas executives from many international 
consortiums and transnational corporations are expected to take 
part in the grand fair, co-sponsored by over ten provinces and 
autonomous regions in north and northwest China. 
  The mayor first expressed his warm welcome to all the 
overseas business people who intend to attend the fair. 
  He said he hoped that the Tianjin's economic ties with 
overseas firms in industry and commerce throughout the world 
will be further strengthened on the basis of mutual interests 
and benefits. 
  Situated in the center of the Bohai Bay area, Tianjin, with 
a 
population of more than nine million people, is also an 
important industrial center in north China, he noted. 
  The 55-year-old Zhang, who graduated from the Economic 
Management Department of Nankai University in Tianjin, said the 
city was one of the first group of coastal cities authorized in 
1984 by the state to open to the outside world. 
  As a port city it boasts a number of advantages of 
convenience in transport by air, sea and land, enormous 
potential for industry and scientific research, and advanced 
urban infrastructural facilities, he said. 
  At the same time, he said, Tianjin has stepped up the 
formulation of rules and regulations concerning foreign affairs, 
built the country's first service center for foreign investment 
and streamlined the registration procedures for foreign-funded 
ventures. 
  According to the latest data, by the end of March this year 
Tianjin had signed contracts for 6,682 foreign-funded 
enterprises, involving an investment totaling 7.9 billion U.S. 
dollars and with a direct use of foreign funds of 5.35 billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  The foreign funds used in the first quarter of this year 
jumped to 250 million U.S. dollars. 
  The mayor said that there are now 15 world-renowned 
transnational companies involved in investment in Tianjin, 
including U.S. firms like Motorola, Otis and Coca-Cola, the 
Japanese companies NEC and Honda, Germany's Henkel, Italy's 
Zanussi and Hong Kong's Karry. 
  There are eight overseas banks in Tianjin, he added. 
  Zhang said that the foreign investment in Tianjin has two 
distinct features: Those who have already invested in Tianjin 
are expanding their amounts of investment and scale of 
production; and the newcomers are "vying with each other in 
looking for investment." 
  Zhang, formerly director of the Tianjin Economic Commission, 
a factory manager and a workshop director, said that the foreign 
investment in Tianjin is now expanding to different fields, 
including industry, agriculture, finance and banking, and real 
estate development, both in rural and urban areas. 
  He said that the local government's policy is to "let 
foreign 
investors make money here". 
  In addition to a good climate for investment, the mayor 
said, 
Tianjin has great potential for further co-operation. 
  The city has, since 1983, imported more than 7,000 items of 
advanced technology and equipment from abroad to upgrade its old 
industrial enterprises. 
  But, he added, much remains to be done because the general 
situation of outdated equipment and products has not changed. 
There are about 700 state-owned firms that need to be improved 
in the coming few years, he noted. 
  As a result, more foreign funds will be needed to upgrade 
these old enterprises, he said. 
  Talking about the future development of the city, Zhang said 
that the construction of a new development zone of 2,300 sq km 
on the coast has already started. 
  He said that foreign funds will also be used to renovate the 
old districts of the city in the coming few years.

  [Text] On the morning of 25 May, Mayor Zhang Lichang 
presided over the 22d routine meeting of the municipal people's 
government to hear the report given by the municipal 
investigation and study group on the experience gained in the 
pilot work of conducting reform in the medical insurance of 
staff members and workers and the report given by the leading 
group in charge of coastal area development on the plan for 
developing key coastal regions and the neighboring areas of 
coastal regions. 
  It was agreed in principle with at the meeting the opinions 
provided by the investigation and study group with regard to 
first conducting the pilot work of medical insurance in the 
municipality, trying to find out experience, gradually 
broadening the range of insurance, and finally having the 
medical insurance be fully underway. 
  During the meeting, Zhang Lichang stressed: The pilot work 
of conducting reform in medical insurance has a bearing on the 
personal interest of the broad masses of staff members and 
workers and on social security. This is an important work 
concerning policies and involving in the whole people. Efforts 
should be made to enhance the leadership over the pilot work of 
conducting reform in medical insurance so as to enable the 
medical insurance system to enter a way of benign cycle. 
  During the meeting, the participating personnel approved in 
principle the plan put forward by the leading group in charge of 
coastal area development with regard to developing coastal 
regions and the neighboring areas of these regions. The plan 
draws up the development work of the following three aspects: 1) 
The development of coastal regions. 2) The development of the 
neighboring areas of coastal regions. 3) The 10-year development 
targets for the neighboring areas of coastal regions. 
  During the meeting, Comrade Zhang Lichang pointed out: 
Developing the neighboring areas of coastal regions by means of 
the development of these regions represents a measure with 
strategic nature. The obviously strong points in communications 
and [words indistinct] possessed by the neighboring areas of 
coastal regions in the municipality are more than those 
possessed by other provinces across the country. Therefore, in 
building up the neighboring areas, it is necessary to (?conduct 
reform and opening up; to achieve development group by group;) 
and to bring the enthusiasm of various social circles into play. 
To be successful in this regard, efforts should be made to 
master the plan; to study the policies; and to successfully 
foster coordination to promote development. We should correctly 
study the policy of utilizing foreign capital and carry forward 
the existing good trend. We should grasp the work in this 
regard more intensively than before. Only by uniting as one 
and making all-out efforts to work hard will units from top to 
bottom across the municipality totally be able to turn the 
neighboring areas into new economic growing points. 
  Lastly, Zhang Lichang stressed: In fulfilling the annual 
tasks, time has almost come to a half. Success or failure in 
the first half has a direct bearing on the development in the 
second half and on the people's confidence in accelerating the 
development in Tianjin. A good job must be done in conducting 
work in various fields with a high standard and a strict demand 
and in ensuring the work in various fields to reach a new level.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday, Tianjin Municipality held a 
mobilization meeting on grafting, readjustment, and 
transformation of state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises, calling on state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises across the municipality to take actions immediately, 
conscientiously implement the guidelines of the second session 
of the sixth municipal party committee and of the municipal 
economic work conference, seize the opportunity, accelerate 
development, realize the fighting objective of generally 
conducting grafting, readjustment, and transformation in all 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, and contribute 
to invigorating Tianjin's economy. 
  Municipal leading comrades Zhang Lichang, Li Shenglin, Li 
Huifen, and Zhang Haosheng, responsible comrades of relevant 
committees, offices, and bureaus, and party and administrative 
top leaders of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises 
attended the meeting. 
  Zhang Lichang gave an important speech at the meeting. He 
said: Tianjin's development of situation is very encouraging. 
During the first quarter of this year, the achievements in 
several major economic norms were the best during recent years. 
The four major fighting objectives of "3-5-8-10" proposed by 
the municipal party committee and the municipal government are 
greatly supported by the broad masses of people, and the popular 
morale is greatly boosted. Using a period of eight years to 
generally conduct grafting, readjustment, and transformation in 
state-owned large and medium- sized enterprises is the key to 
invigorating the existing number of enterprises of this 
category, the basis, and the requirement for realizing other 
fighting objectives. Practice showed that it is not realistic 
to adopt the attitude of "waiting for, relying on, and asking 
for help" in the course of changing the backward outlook of 
enterprises and that we must emancipate ourselves. It is 
necessary to fully mobilize the masses to "show their special 
talents." At present, we are facing a very favorable 
international and domestic macro environment. As long as the 
upper and lower levels across the municipality seek unity of 
thinking, strengthen confidence, work on their own initiative, 
take voluntary actions, develop cooperation at home, conduct 
grafting externally, and try by all possible means to use 
domestic and foreign funds, all difficulties will be resolved, 
old enterprises will be rejuvenated, and Tianjin will have great 
hope. 
  Li Huifen addressed the meeting. He said: Since the 
beginning of this year, with the spirit of never delaying the 
work of one day, the municipal relevant departments have 
conducted lots of investigations to know the real situation and 
to determine the enterprise category, size, and planning work. 
In line with the actual municipal situation, at present, we 
have designated 748 enterprises as the municipality's 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, of which three 
are exceptionally large enterprises, 138 are large enterprises, 
and 607 are medium-sized enterprises. At present, relevant 
departments have formulated plans for enterprise grafting, 
readjustment, and transformation. These plans have defined a 
high starting point, clear ideas, and explicit objectives, and 
placed the resting point on raising economic efficiency, 
cultivating new economic growing points, and laying a good 
foundation for the next step of work. 
  Li Huifen set forth demands on successfully conducting 
grafting, readjustment, and transformation in state-owned large 
and medium- sized enterprises. She said: It is necessary to 
fully understand the major significance in successfully 
conducting enterprise grafting, readjustment, and transformation 
work. The four major fighting objectives of "3-5-8-10" is an 
important policy decision of the municipal party committee and 
government for invigorating Tianjin's economy. Of this, using 
eight years or so to generally conduct grafting, readjustment, 
and transformation in state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises is the basis and requirement of these four 
objectives and where the key to realizing the four objectives 
lies. Without the sustained and steady development of the 
industrial economy, it is impossible to quadruple the GNP of the 
whole municipality three years ahead of schedule; it is also 
difficult to renovate dangerous and shabby houses if enterprises 
have difficulties and workers have no money to do it; and in 
building coastal new areas, it is necessary to have stable 
social environment and economic conditions. Judging from 
Tianjin's present situation of state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises, owing to some historical reasons, some 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in the 
municipality have not been transformed for a long time, and the 
phenomenon of outdated enterprises and obsolete equipment is 
very serious. Among the state-owned large and medium- sized 
enterprises, there are some money-losing enterprises. The 
fundamental way out to end the situation of low level, 
unmarketable products, and low efficiency in these enterprises 
is to accelerate enterprise grafting, readjustment, and 
transformation, update and upgrade products, and urge 
enterprises to end deficits, increase profits, and raise 
economic efficiency. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tianjin, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Overseas investment into 
the Wuqing High-Technology Development Zone in this north China 
port city has risen rapidly this year. 
  The latest figures show that in the zone there are now 116 
domestic and foreign enterprises in the sectors of mechanics, 
electronics, biology, textiles, new building materials and 
energy resources, with a total investment of 1.7 billion yuan. 
Some 69 of them are funded by firms from the United States, 
Britain, France and Japan, and by Hong Kong and Taiwan 
companies, with a total overseas investment of 130 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  The Wuqing zone, one of the first high-tech development 
zones 
approved by the state, covers an area of 24.8 sq km. As an 
important part of north China's "Silicon Valley", Wuqing is 
quite different, in several ways, from other development zones 
alongside the Beijing-Tianjin Expressway. 
  It will be built into a garden-like high-tech park, with two 
lakes in the center of the zone. Around the lakes will be 
villas in different styles which are well on the way to 
completion. 
  Currently, within the zone a Japanese-funded quartz 
resonator 
project has gone into trial operation, with an investment of 
five billion yen. 
  A musical instrument manufacturing and supply center, one of 
the biggest in the world and financed by a Taiwan firm, is 
expected to be operational in five years. It will cover an area 
of 10 ha and its investment totals 28 million U.S. dollars. 
  To meet the demands of the fast-growing overseas investment 
in the zone, the administration committee has decided to provide 
another 200 million yuan to step up infrastructure construction, 
including a multi-function hall, hotels, apartment houses, a 
customs building and a bilingual high school.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 25 (XINHUA) -- North China's biggest 
industrial city of Tianjin has gained a record influx of 
overseas investment of more than one billion U.S. dollars in the 
first quarter of this year. 
  This marks the city as one of the hottest attractions in 
China for thousands of worldwide investors, according to the 
latest official data. 
  Analysts here attributed the fast expansion of overseas 
investment in Tianjin to a good environment for cooperation and 
the local government's policies of opening wider to the outside 
world. 
  Peter K. Hahnel, German general manager of the Tianjin 
Henkel Detergent and Cleaning Products Co., Ltd., said that 
Tianjin has better infrastructural facilities, including 
transport and telecommunication, compared with other cities 
across the country. In addition, it has richer water, 
electricity and raw materials resources. 
  What is more important, he said, is that the city has laid a 
good foundation for the development of both heavy and light 
industries. 
  "We can find our best partners here," said Hahnel. 
  The company, a joint venture funded by the German-based 
Henkel Company, was set up last year. It has an annual 
production of 92,000 tons of detergent, both for industrial and 
daily use, with sales of 330 million yuan yearly. 
  He said, "the reason that we could put our new company into 
operation in a short period of less than six months is mainly 
because the Tianjin detergent factory had been the biggest and 
the best manufacturer in north China." 
  "The reason we chose Tianjin to invest in is very simple," 
Sentaro Negoro, director general manager of the Tianjin (Earth) 
Chemical Co., Ltd., told XINHUA. 
  "It has a world first-class tin-making manufacturer that 
enables our products to enter China's market with high quality 
and low cost," he said. 
  "Earth" is one of the biggest insecticide producers in 
Japan, 
employing more than 800 people and registering annual sales of 
37 billion yen. It put a total of 830,000 U.S. dollars into 
the Tianjin venture to develop six kinds of insecticides. 
  While many overseas investors value the industrial bases in 
the city, other transnational high-tech firms are attracted to 
the abundance of well-educated workers provided by the numerous 
institutions of higher learning and research institutes here. 
  After a seven-year investigation throughout China, the U.S. 
firm Motorola decided to build its company in Tianjin. 
  C. W. Ko, manager of Tianjin Motorola's Human Resource 
Department, said that the majority of the 1,000 Chinese 
employees of the firm are graduates from universities and 
colleges, and many of them have received master's or doctor's 
degrees. 
  "In Tianjin, we can make contact with all kinds of 
professional workers our company needs," he said. 
  He said that Tianjin is an old industrial city. The 
dedication of Tianjin's workers benefits the long-term 
investment here. 
  Not long ago, after careful scrutiny into the investment 
environment here, Novo Nordisk, the world's biggest producer of 
industrial enzymes, invested 250 million U.S. dollars in 
Tianjin to build a modern biological products plant. 
  Almost all the transnational companies in Tianjin spoke 
highly of the efforts by the local government to create a good 
environment for foreign investment. 
  The German Manager Hahnel said the government here knows 
very 
well what to do for the foreign investors and how to help them 
start a business and run it well. 
  An overseas-funded food company said that the government 
always pays close attention to suggestions and complaints the 
joint ventures raise, regarding such matters as environmental 
protection. 
  However, much remains to be done to improve the investment 
environment in the city. It is not so easy for overseas 
investors and visitors to find comfortable apartments or office 
buildings. They often have to wait a long time for 
accommodations after first arriving. 
  As a result, the city has now stepped up the pace on 
construction of such buildings. A dozen new buildings are now 
under construction and expected to be completed in the near 
future. 
  Some overseas real estate investors have contracted for 
building luxury hotels here, according to a local official.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 26 (XINHUA) -- More and more Chinese 
university students are now taking part-time jobs to earn extra 
pocket money and to test their wings in the larger social arena. 
  In Tianjin, the north China's biggest industrial city, the 
number of college students who have taken part-time jobs is 
estimated at more than 50 percent. 
  Many of the students are likely to take part-time jobs on 
campus, as laboratory and library assistants or as tutors, 
receptionists, door keepers and porters. 
  Tan Huijun, a senior student of the Management Department of 
Nankai University, has netted a monthly pay of 100 yuan offering 
a daily two-hour service at a roller-skating court. Wei 
Shangfeng, a sophomore of the Thermal Energy Department of the 
Tianjin University, gets a monthly pay of 50 yuan by doing 
cleaning in the campus. 
  A student affairs official with Tianjin University said 
great 
changes have taken place among today's students. More and more 
students believe that they should try their best to support 
themselves through their own labor, he said, adding that they 
are not willing to rely on their parents entirely. 
  To encourage students to work hard on their subjects while 
taking part-time jobs, the authorities of Tianjin universities 
and colleges have formulated relevant regulations governing 
part-time work.

  [Text] On the morning of 26 May, Zhou Wenhua, chairman of 
the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], met with the CIS veteran 
soldiers visiting delegation led by (Babulin), chairman of the 
Veteran Soldiers Committee of the CIS. Most of the delegation 
members once visited China during war time during which they 
fought side by side with the Chinese army and people and 
established profound friendship with them. 
  On behalf of the provincial CPPCC Committee, Zhou Wenhua 
extended deep respect to these veteran soldiers. He briefed the 
guests on our province's situation as well as the economic 
development situation since the starting of reform and opening 
up, and answered their questions on trade union work, the 
pension system, and placement for retired cadres. 
  Zhou Wenhua pointed out: Heilongjiang Province has the two 
major advantages of being contiguous and complementary in 
developing economic and trade cooperation with the CIS 
countries. At present, the interregional economic relations 
have developed from economic and trade relations in the past 
into a new stage of economic and technological cooperation. 
There are broad prospects for cooperation between both sides. 
  The 10-member CIS veteran soldiers delegation was invited by 
the national CPPCC Committee and arrived in Harbin city by plane 
yesterday evening. Accompanied by Dai Moan, vice chairman of 
the provincial CPPCC Committee, the delegation members zealously 
visited Harbin Flax Plant and (Tianhua) Garment Plant which was 
jointly funded by Harbin and Russia, and laid a wreath at the 
tombs of the Soviet Red Army soldiers.

<F P=106> [Article by Guo Baofu (6753 1405 4395) entitled "Deepen </F>
Rural Reform And Vigorously Carry Out the Shareholding 
Cooperative System"] 
  [Text] The implementation of the shareholding cooperative 
system is a key breakthrough in the rural property right system 
as well as a great creation by the Chinese peasants following 
the implementation of the system of contracted responsibility on 
the household basis with payment linked to output and the sudden 
emergence of town and township enterprises. Practice shows that 
this system conforms to the development and the changes of the 
rural situation; satisfies the broad masses of the peasants's 
urgent demands and strong desires for defining collective 
property rights, conducting property cooperation, and expanding 
the scale of production and management; and accelerates the pace 
of having the peasants become fairly well-off. 
  Just as what we did in those years to carry out the system 
of 
contracted responsibility for production, we should persistently 
proceed from reality to develop shareholding cooperative 
enterprises, fully respect the enthusiasm and creativeness of 
the masses, give free reins to the development of these 
enterprises, adopt different forms according to different actual 
conditions, try every possible means to expand the scale of the 
implementation of this system and to accelerate the 
implementation pace, not stick to one pattern, and not demand 
uniformity. To encourage the development of shareholding 
cooperative enterprises, we should formulate preferential 
policies on developing such enterprises; regard such enterprises 
as collective ones; give them preferential treatment in the 
scale of management and in the aspects of management, new 
product development, technological transformation, capital 
input, tax reduction and exemption, industrial and commercial 
management, and capital construction; and create conditions for 
developing such enterprises. 
  Now, the shareholding cooperative enterprises in the rural 
areas can roughly be divided into four categories as follows: 
The enterprises of the first category are set up by pooling 
capital from among the people. With township and village 
cooperative economic organizations acting as go-between, the 
peasants are voluntarily organized to manage the projects 
through accurate selections and according to the agreements that 
they have attained. Those whose stocks amount to a large 
proportion or technicians should be enterprise leaders. The 
enterprises of the second category are set up by collectives 
with shares. Township and village collectives can become 
shareholders by offering land, workshops, equipment, and means 
of production as well as investing some money. Peasants can 
become shareholders by investing money. Shareholders can enter 
plants with capital or make investment instead of labor. All 
shareholders can draw extra dividends. The enterprises of the 
third category are organized by various sectors. These 
enterprises' shares are owned by peasants, enterprises, township 
and village collectives, and society. Boards of directors will 
assume responsibility for the management of these enterprises. 
The enterprises of the fourth category are set up through joint 
management and cooperation. As shareholders, urban and rural 
institutions and their staff members and workers can cooperate 
with rural collectives to develop projects and run enterprises, 
break with the bounds of trades, and become shareholders by 
offering capital, technologies, land, and other production 
factors. Besides the aforementioned four categories, we should 
persist in various forms in the course of development, respect 
the aspirations of the masses, avoid rigid mediation, and ensure 
the sound development of the shareholding cooperative 
enterprises. 
  At the time of vigorously running shareholding cooperative 
enterprises, we should focus the change of enterprise mechanisms 
on transforming the existing enterprises into shareholding 
cooperative ones. Through the forms of converting into stocks 
and expanding stocks, we should transform the existing 
enterprises into shareholding cooperative ones, further define 
property rights, intensify the staff and workers' awareness of 
being the masters of enterprises, perfect the enterprise 
democratic management and supervision mechanisms, guarantee and 
increase the value of enterprise assets, and enhance the reserve 
strength for enterprises' development. In the course of 
transformation, we should give different instructions to 
different enterprises. We should proceed from the increment of 
enterprises' property and promote, in a step- by-step manner, 
the transformation of enterprises first from those in danger and 
with difficulties and those in urgent need of expanding the 
scale of production. Practice shows that the following five 
enterprise transformation patterns can vigorously be carried 
out: First, the pattern of one enterprise with various systems. 
The enterprises which are on a larger scale and have larger 
amounts of debts and the difficulties in continuing their 
management are allowed to have parts of their enterprises with 
vitality carry out the shareholding cooperative system. The 
rest parts should be auctioned, rent, or managed on a mortgage 
or contracted basis. That is, an enterprise can carry out 
various systems. 
  These enterprises' debts should be repaid 
year after year by their head plants which rely on collecting 
rent and contracted charges. Second, the pattern of measuring 
property. The enterprises whose plants are built with 
collective investment, whose property value has increased by a 
big margin, and whose staff members and workers have made great 
contributions as well as those with small profits and capability 
to maintain their production should thoroughly conduct 
transformation by sorting out and assessing property, defining 
property rights, and converting property into stocks and 
marketing these stocks to rural collectives, enterprises, and 
staff members and workers. Third, the pattern of increment of 
property. The enterprises with good economic results, readily 
marketable products, and appropriate prospects for development 
but in need of more working funds to develop new projects, to 
increase new products, and to expand the scale of production and 
management should externally draw stockholders and investment to 
expand the increment of property and internally define property 
rights to staff members and workers. Simultaneously, a portion 
of these enterprises' stocks should be controlled by rural 
collectives and the rest should be marketed to society. Fourth, 
the pattern of transferring property rights. The enterprises 
with less property, small profits, or deficits; on a smaller 
scale; and without hope to change their situation within a short 
period of time under the restrictions of objective conditions 
should sort out and evaluate their property, fix prices for 
themselves, and market themselves to stockholders so that they 
will become shareholding cooperative enterprises without 
collective money paid for shares. Meanwhile, rural collectives 
should withdraw the money from marketing property rights to 
develop another new enterprises. Fifth, the pattern of 
shareholding companies. The enterprises with different scales, 
economic results, and management forms as well as with certain 
difficulties in independent development and that supplement with 
one another to a certain extent through cooperation should be 
organized into shareholding cooperative companies with key 
enterprises playing a dominant role. These companies can rely on 
their collective advantages to pioneer markets. 
  In line with the principles of development before 
standardization, of standardization in the course of 
development, and of transformation after standardization, we 
should standardize the systems governing formulating 
regulations, defining property rights, setting up organizations, 
exercising management, distributing extra dividend, and making 
guaranteeing measures so as to organize, perfect, transform, and 
standardize town and township enterprises' shareholding 
cooperative systems. First, it is necessary to scientifically 
calculate stocks and reasonably define stock rights. According 
to the principles of voluntary purchases of stocks, of equality 
between shareholders, of shareholders with the same amounts of 
stocks being distributed with the same amounts of profits, and 
of sharing profits and running risks on equal terms, we should 
mainly establish stocks for the rural areas, society, social 
legal persons, foreign investors, and individuals. We should 
define the total volume of enterprise stocks and the price for 
each stock to enable all the staff members and workers of the 
newly built enterprises and the enterprises whose increment has 
been expanded to buy enterprise shares so as to enhance their 
enthusiasm and sense of responsibility to run the enterprises 
well and to enable their staff and workers to have both rights 
and duties and not only to participate in management but also to 
run risks. The staff members and workers of these enterprises 
must not get a refund for their stocks. The shareholders who 
are not working at enterprises should neither be engaged in 
management and policy-making nor get a refund of their money for 
shares before expiration of their terms. But, they can be 
distributed with fixed amounts of dividends. To ensure that 
enterprises have sufficient reserve strength for development, we 
should define enterprises' property accumulated by enterprises 
themselves and added through state tax reduction and exemption 
as enterprise stocks. The profits distributed to enterprises 
according to the enterprise stocks can only be retained by 
enterprises for use to expand production. That is, enterprise 
stocks must not be obtained by any individuals. Second, it is 
necessary to perfect organizations, regulations, and systems. 
To strengthen the leadership and management of the shareholding 
cooperative enterprises, these enterprises should set up the 
systems to hold meetings of shareholders and shareholders 
congresses. These meetings and congresses can elect and produce 
boards of directors and boards of supervisors; define rights and 
duties for the boards, methods for producing enterprise legal 
persons, management strategies, methods for establishing and 
managing funds paid for shares, and major policies on 
distribution of profits; formulate enterprise regulations and 
systems for management of financial affairs, labor, materials, 
and quality to standardize enterprises' activities. Third, we 
should take all aspects into consideration and achieve the 
distribution of profits. We should focus the standardization of 
shareholding cooperative enterprises on distribution of extra 
dividends; take into consideration the profits of owners, 
managers, and producers; ensure the payment of various taxes to 
the state; guarantee that enterprises have sufficient reserve 
strength for development; combine the principle of distribution 
according to work with that of distribution according to stocks; 
and accurately handle the ratios in the distribution of labor 
wages. According to the demands for expansion of production, 
enterprises should annually obtain a portion of after-tax 
profits, convert this portion of money into stocks, and 
distribute these stocks to shareholders for use to expand 
production. The enterprises that are in the initial stage of 
carrying out the shareholding cooperative system are allowed to 
carry out the policy on retaining interests and distributing 
extra dividends so as to encourage increasingly more people to 
buy stocks and to become major shareholders. The interests of 
the money paid for stocks should be listed into production and 
management costs. Shareholding cooperative enterprises should 
be treated as rural collective enterprises, enjoy all 
preferential policies, and draw and use various special funds 
according to the standards for collective enterprises.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Zhiyun (0491 1807 0061) "Carry out </F>
Organizational Reform, Boost Large and Medium-Sized Enterprises, 
Enhance the Organizational Construction"] 
  [Text] The provincial people's government held a meeting 
with the participation of responsible comrades from various 
departments and units under the provincial people's government 
on 11 May to make arrangements for the three tasks of 
implementing the "three definitiveness" plan for conducting 
organizational reform among the subordinate departments of the 
provincial people's government, of boosting the large and 
medium-sized enterprises, and of enhancing the organizational 
construction of the provincial people's government. 
  Vice Governor Xiao Zuofu presided over the meeting and 
Executive Vice Governor Wen Shizhen delivered a speech at it. 
  Wen Shizhen said: We should vigorously grasp the 
implementation of the appraised "three definitiveness" plan for 
conducting organizational reform among 42 departments under the 
provincial people's government. We should strive to put the 
plan in place by the end of May and carry out the reform in line 
with the demands set in the plan in June. For this, he put 
forward the following demands in his speech: 
  First, various departments should break down the existing 
functions of their own. Then, in line with the demands of 
developing the socialist market economy, they should analyze and 
distinguish the functions one by one so as to determine which 
should be enhanced, which should be weakened, and which should 
be transferred. Only by clarifying these issues can we define 
the size of internal organs and staffers in line with the 
principle of "assigning personnel according to the work". 
  Second, by proceeding from the whole situation, various 
departments must adopt resolute measures to implement the staff 
size approved for internal organs and the number of posts 
approved for leading personnel. They must be determined to 
fulfill the simplifying tasks of organizational reform. Based 
on the existing number of sections and offices, we should 
simplify them by cutting 30 percent of them and chiefly reduce 
the organs that are conducting self-management and self-service. 
  Third, we should vigorously make proper arrangements for the 
surplus personnel and be determined to broaden the channels of 
personnel transfer. We should also encourage organs' cadres to 
open economic entities, to rend an enterprise, and to find a job 
in enterprises and establishments. Personnel whose age is near 
to retirement will be allowed to retire from their post ahead of 
time. Meanwhile, we should clear up the TDY personnel of organs. 
  Fourth, we should explore reforms for the managerial systems 
of cadres and enforce personnel exchanges. 
  Fifth, we should vigorously promote the reform among 
establishments and units. Through the reform we should 
differentiate the leading system, organizational establishment, 
staff size control, and the systems of personnel affairs and 
distributions of these establishments and units from those of 
the party and government organs. Efforts should be made to cut 
the number of units and personnel who are living on "royal 
grains". 
  While citing the issue of boosting the large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, Wen Shizhen said: 
Currently, most large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises 
have not been enlivened. Particularly under the new situation 
of accelerating the establishment of socialist market economic 
systems, the pace in enlivening these enterprises has been 
difficult. It must be noted that through the reform and 
construction conducted over the past many years, these 
state-owned enterprises have possessed strong and actual 
strength in the economy and laid a solid technical foundation. 
They have also possessed a large number of talented personnel 
outstanding in science, technology, and management. Under the 
new situation, only by truly doing away with the fetter caused 
by the out-dated systems; straightening out their ideas of 
development; and concentrating their efforts on shifting the 
mechanism, conducting reform and readjustment, opening markets, 
and enhancing the management; can these enterprises bring their 
tremendous potential into play and be fully brimming with vigor 
and vitality. 
  In citing the issue of enhancing the organizational 
construction of the provincial people's government, Wen Shizhen 
said: The provincial people's government has decided, by 
regarding the implementation of the "three definitiveness" plan 
as a turning point, to carry out consolidation among its 
subordinate organs and to further enhance the organizational 
construction so as to enable the organs under the provincial 
people's government to meet the demands of developing the 
socialist market economy and to better perform their duties. He 
urged these organs to regard their leading body as a focal point 
in enhancing the organizational construction. Efforts should be 
made to establish a system under which organs hold 
responsibility for the attainment of certain objectives in work. 
He also urged them to unswervingly wage the struggle against 
corruption and the campaign of encouraging administrative 
honesty and to resolutely score new results in the struggle and 
campaign. These organs should intensively formulate regulations 
and rules in various fields and strictly enforce their work 
discipline so as to meet the demands of their new functions. 
They should also further emancipate minds, heighten their 
spirit, and implement their work in various fields in a 
down-to-earth manner. 
  At the meeting, Vice Governor Xiao Zuofu announced the 
opinions of the provincial people's government with regard to 
appraising again the staff size of working departments and the 
number of the leading posts of internal organs. In his report, 
the deputy secretary general of the provincial people's 
government described the work plan of the guiding group in 
charge of enlivening the large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises. 
  Attending the meeting were vice governors of the province, 
including Cong Zhenglong, Gao Guozhu, and Zhang Rongming; and 
responsible comrades from various departments and units under 
the provincial people's government--more than 200 persons in all.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter From China: "Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb </F>
Experiment Base in Qinghai To Be Demilitarized and Used as the 
Site for a Development Zone"] 
  [Text] China's first nuclear weapons research and 
development base is located along side the Qinghai Lake in 
Haiyan County of Qinghai Province. As China's first atomic bomb 
and first hydrogen bomb were successfully developed there, 
people call it the "two-bomb base." 
  On entering the "two-bomb base," what one sees first is a 
monument. The inscription, "China's First Nuclear Weapons 
Research and Development Base," was written by General Zhang 
Aiping. 
  The "two-bomb base" was built in 1958, and its formal name 
was the State-Owned 221 Plant. In those days, a number of 
nuclear specialists, under the direction of by Marshal Nie 
Rongzhen, gathered here to research and develop atomic and 
hydrogen bombs. During the six years between 1958, when the 
construction of the base started, and 1964, China succeeded in 
conducting an experiment with its first atomic bomb. Two years 
later, China succeeded in developing its first hydrogen bomb 
there. Over the past years, China has produced many atomic and 
hydrogen bombs at the base. 
  In those years, the "two-bomb base" was very mysterious. For 
the sake of keeping secrets, the "two-bomb base" was called the 
Qinghai Provincial Mining Zone by outsiders. The base was an 
independent "small society," and all activities of its personnel 
were carried out within the base. Even the dead had to be 
cremated inside the base, and their remains were not allowed to 
be removed. In 1987, the State Council gave its approval to 
closing down the base, and the personnel was pulled out one 
after another. 
  At present, the former site of the "two-bomb base" has 
become 
the seat of the Haibei Zang Nationality Autonomous Prefecture 
Government of Qinghai Province. Because of the enormous scale 
of the "two-bomb base," the transfer work has not been 
officially completed. Next month, the Beihai Autonomous 
Prefecture will officially sign a transfer contract with the 
China National Nuclear Industry Corporation. 
  In those years, the people of the Beihai Autonomous 
Prefecture, those of Haiyan County in particular, paid a 
tremendous price for the construction of the "two-bomb base." 
They vacated more than 1,100 sq. km (equivalent to the total 
area of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories) of their 
best pasture land for the base. The prefecture still has no 
large industrial enterprises. 
  The fixed assets of the base at the time of its closure were 
over 100 million renminbi, after depreciation on the basis of 
their price in 1958. 
  A specialist maintains that a base of the same size could 
not 
be built for less than several billion yuan today. The amount 
of this "legacy" is quite enormous. It includes 560,000 sq. m 
of buildings inside plant premises, 330,000 sq. m of production 
buildings, more than 40 km of special railway lines which 
converge with the Qinghai- Tibet Railway Line, nearly 80 km of 
standard highways, 1,000 six-digit computer-controlled 
telephones, and one thermal power plant with an annual 
generating capacity of 110 million kwh. These facilities can be 
used with slight alterations. They have suddenly turned Haibei 
Autonomous Prefecture into an area with the most convenient 
transportation facilities, the most complete production and 
daily life facilities, and the best environment for investment 
among other prefectures and counties of Qinghai. 
  The Haibei Autonomous Prefecture Government has designated 
the former site of the "two-bomb base" as a "small zone for 
nationality economy development" and has formulated a series of 
preferential policies for investment. At present, the 
feasibility study on the Haibei Autonomous Metal Sodium Plant, 
the Electrolyte Aluminum Plant, the Soda Ash Plant, and the 
Caustic Soda Plant has been approved and put on record, and the 
construction of these projects will soon start on the former 
site of the "two-bomb base." Besides, the Haibei Autonomous 
Prefecture has also planned to build a series of other projects, 
including a power plant, an aluminum plant, a magnesium plant, 
and a carbonization plant. Most of these projects are 
Sino-foreign joint ventures, and the letters of intent for some 
of them have already been signed.

  [Text] Xining, May 25 (XINHUA) -- North-west China's 
Qinghai Province has been forging closer overseas economic ties 
to promote local economic development. 
  Last month, a delegation of the province visited the United 
States to solicit business and netted 533 million U.S. dollars' 
worth of investment intentions. 
  This formed a sharp contrast with the situation in 1980, 
when 
the province exported a mere 4.02 million U.S. dollars' worth of 
goods, all just to Hong Kong and Macao. 
  In 1993, the province exported 100 million U.S. dollars' 
worth of products to over 120 countries worldwide. 
  By the end of 1993, the province had seen the pouring-in of 
430 million U.S. dollars' worth of investments by businesses 
from 14 countries and regions, including the United States, 
Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and others. 
  Over the past decade, the province has also imported 64.7 
million U.S. dollars' worth of advanced equipment and technology 
from overseas. The figure for the January-April period of this 
year was 11.9 million U.S. dollars. 
  Since 1992, the province has taken part in or held trade 
talks in Xian, Urumqi and Hong Kong, in a drive to promote its 
image. 
  The province has been upgrading its transport and 
telecommunications systems to improve its investment 
environment. It has also started law consultancy, accounting, 
international transport, insurance and other services to 
overseas businesses operating in the province. 
  On the other hand, the province has received a total 80 
million U.S. dollars in overseas donations and free aid in 
recent years. 
  The authorities expect that foreign investment and overseas 
preferential loans to the province will hit 200 million U.S. 
dollars this year.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Dong Pei (5516 1014): "Qinghai Provincial </F>
Statistical Bureau Director Song Xiuyan Says at a News 
Conference That the Province's Economy Enjoys Sustained and 
Rapid Growth and Healthy Development"] 
  [Text] Our province's economy in 1993 scored the 
achievement of moving in a healthy direction amid sustained and 
rapid growth. At a news conference held on 20 January by the 
provincial statistical bureau, bureau director Song Xiuyan said 
that in 1993, our province achieved three breakthroughs in 
economic operations: Total industrial and agricultural output 
value topped 10 billion yuan, GDP 10 billion yuan, and financial 
revenue 1.1 billion yuan. 
  Initial calculations by the provincial statistical bureau 
estimated that the province's GDP in 1993 could hit 10.1 billion 
yuan, up 9.5 percent from 1992 on comparable prices and 
achieving the provincial party and government's goal of 
"maintaining 8 percent growth and fighting for 9 percent 
growth." Total social demand could exceed total supply by 3.97 
percent, which would be within reasonable control. The 
following are developments in various areas: 
  Industrial production maintained its relatively high-speed 
growth, with parallel growth in production and sales and slight 
improvement in economic returns. According to 
progress-indicating figures, in 1993, manufacturing enterprises 
of all the province's counties and localities above the county 
level produced industrial output value of 7.67 billion yuan, up 
13.4 percent from 1992, and scored 6.804 billion yuan in sales 
value, up 13.5 percent. Our province's ongoing economic 
development is distinguished by: 1) strong indications of 
investment-pulled growth; 2) government industry as the main 
force of the province's industrial development, though its 
growth rate is lower than that of nongovernment industry; 3) 
large and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises as the keel of 
the province's industry, playing a decisive role; 4) the value 
of completed exports and deliveries has continued to be good; 
and 5) there has been an improvement in economic efficiency. 
Initial calculations estimate that overall economic return 
indicators could reach 69.5 percent, an increase of about 5 
percentage points from 1992 on a comparable basis. Of this, 265 
state-owned budgetary manufacturing enterprises saw their total 
profits and remitted tax increase by 25.1 percent to 272 million 
yuan, which did not include the profits and taxes generated by 
the Qinghai Petroleum Bureau. Industrial development, however, 
remained beset by problems such as sluggish growth in light 
industry and low economic returns. 
  The status of agriculture as the foundation of the 
province's 
economy continued to be reinforced and consolidated. The output 
of grain and oil-bearing crops hit record high levels. Animal 
husbandry output dropped as a result of natural disasters, but 
not as badly as had been predicted. Total grain output for the 
whole province was 1,186,300 tonnes, slightly higher than 1992 
and an all-time high. The total output of oil-bearing crops was 
152,100 tonnes, up 8.4 percent from 1992 and also an all-time 
high. Grazing livestock in the whole province increased by a 
total of 16.6 percent, with a year-end estimate of 22.1 million 
head, down 2.67 percent from 1992. 
  Construction has expanded in scale, and key projects have 
progressed well. State-owned units of the whole province 
completed fixed-asset investment of 3.455 billion yuan, up 33.8 
percent from the same period of [as published] 1992, of which 
investment in infrastructure projects and in renovation and 
transformation were up respectively 65.1 percent and 46.9 
percent. The characteristics of fixed-asset investment were: 
Infrastructure investment was concentrated on central projects, 
and renovation and transformation investment on local projects; 
production investment increased faster than nonproduction 
investment; key construction projects went well; construction 
funds reached where they were needed; and there were relatively 
bigger increases in newly installed fixed assets. 
  The situation in transport has improved, and there was 
growth 
in post and telecommunications services. The Xining Railway 
Sub-Bureau halted a 10-month fall and pushed the cargo transport 
volume back up to a level 2.1 percent higher than that in 1992. 
The road cargo transport volume was down 7.9 percent from 1992. 
Post and telecommunications services of the whole province rose 
24 percent from 1992. 
  Market sales were stable; foreign trade improved; new 
headway 
was made in opening up to the outside world; and prices rose by 
greater margins. The total commodity retail sales of the whole 
province were up 13.6 percent from 1992, or 1.2 percent allowing 
for price rises. The pattern in commodity retail markets was: 
Retail sales in consumer goods were relatively brisk; corporate 
spending was brought under control; markets in urban areas were 
prosperous and vibrant; sales in rural markets were sluggish; 
increases in the retail volumes of state-owned commercial units 
slowed and retail sales decreased in proportion. Foreign trade 
reversed the falling trend in the fourth quarter and rose 19.71 
percent from 1992 in annual import and export value; of which 
exports grew 12.51 percent. In 1993, our province registered 53 
companies as foreign-invested enterprises and imported $17.6 
million of foreign capital. It was the year in which 
foreign-invested enterprises developed the fastest since reform 
and opening up. The provincial market price index in 1993 rose 
from 107.9 in January to 116.6 in December. Initial 
calculations estimated that the overall retail price level would 
rise 12.3 percent from 1992. 
  Local financial revenue increased and financial order 
improved further. Local financial revenue for the whole 
province amounted to 1.135 billion yuan, up 39.1 percent from 
1992. By the end of 1993, the total savings balance of all 
banks was 8.531 billion yuan, 17.86 percent higher than early in 
the year. Cash income for banks of the whole province increased 
44.7 percent from 1992, while cash expenditure was up 45.1 
percent. 
  Income for urban and rural residents increased. A survey of 
a sample of urban residents showed that the per-capita income 
for living expenses of the province's urban residents was 
1,879.29 yuan, up 19.77 percent, while per-capita consumption 
expenditure was 1,817.68 yuan, up 22.1 percent. The per-capita 
net income of the province's peasants and herdsmen was 672.33 
yuan, up 11.4 percent from 1992.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Lin Yuwen (2651 6735 2429): "Migrant </F>
Workers Are Swarming Into Xinjiang"] 
  [Text] Urumqi, 3 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The spring 
is over and wild geese have flown to the north again. 
  Following these wild geese are tens of thousands of migrant 
workers, who are swarming into Xinjiang like tides. 
  Statistics provided by the Urumqi railway station's 
passenger 
transportation department indicate that the railway station 
transported 200,000 migrant workers in the autumn and winter of 
last year, and more than 100,000 migrant workers have come to 
Urumqi from 20 February of this year to the present. 
  These migrant workers are only staying in Xinjiang 
temporarily, but more have settled down in the region. 
According to a report by XINJIANG JUNKEN BAO [Army Reclamation 
Newspaper], there is a production team on a vegetable farm in 
the southern part of the Taklimakan desert that consists of 430 
members, all of whom are migrant workers. Zheng Bangjun came to 
Xinjiang from Sichuan's Qiuling County. As soon as he found a 
plot of land for development in the Tarim basin in 1987, he 
immediately helped move six of his eight brothers and sisters to 
this place. 
  Incomplete statistics show that there are more than 300,000 
migrant workers in Xinjiang now. 
  Migrant workers keep coming to Xinjiang despite its 
remoteness in location. 
  The emergence of migrant workers' thronging into Xinjiang 
has 
been due to China's reform and opening up and to the 
breakthroughs in rural economic structural reform. Contracting 
land to each household and linking remunerations to output have 
boosted the initiative of the 800 million peasants, thus 
emancipating the productive forces and making it possible for 
many peasants to leave their farmlands for cities. The reform 
of China's grain policy, which was introduced in 1993, enabled 
the peasants to stay in cities. In the past, commodity grain 
was not available without urban domicile. This domicile 
registration system tightly restricted the peasants to the rural 
areas. The overall lifting of control over grain prices had a 
great impact on the domicile registration system and made it 
possible for surplus rural laborers to move to cities. 
Therefore, in a sense, the emergence of a large number of 
migrant workers at present is a sign of social progress.

program] 
  [Text] The regional conference on propaganda and 
ideological work opened in Urumqi today. 
  The tasks high on the conference's agenda are to relay and 
implement the guidelines of the national conference on 
propaganda and ideological work and to study and work out plans, 
in close connection with Xinjiang's reality, on strengthening 
and improving propaganda and ideological work. The conference 
will study ways to exercise more effective party leadership over 
and improve propaganda and ideological work. 
  Janabil, deputy secretary of the regional CPC Committee, 
presided over the conference. Entrusted by the regional party 
committee and Comrade Song Hanliang, Abulaiti Abudurexiti, 
deputy secretary of the regional CPC committee and chairman of 
the regional government, delivered a speech: "Implement the 
Guidelines of the National Conference on Propaganda and 
Ideological Work and Raise the Region's Propaganda and 
Ideological Work To a New Level." 
  Abulaiti Abudurexiti's speech was divided into three parts: 
1) further enhance our understanding of the importance and 
functions of propaganda and ideological work from an overall 
strategic viewpoint; 2) strive to accomplish the various tasks 
with regard to propaganda and ideological work in close 
adherence to the fundamental principles; and 3) exercise more 
effective party leadership over the propaganda and ideological 
work and improve the competence of the ranks of the cadres in 
charge of propaganda and ideological work. 
  Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: The propaganda and ideological 
front is a very important front charged with the responsibility 
of providing motive force, ideological guarantees, and support 
through the creation of public opinion. At the national 
conference on propaganda and ideological work earlier this year, 
central leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji, 
delivered important speeches that stressed once again the great 
importance of reinforcing propaganda and ideological work in the 
new period. We must recognize the importance of propaganda and 
ideological work from the high plane of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the overall task of the party's work 
as a whole. 
  Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: It is especially important and 
urgent for Xinjiang to step up propaganda and ideological work. 
Due to reasons both historical and contemporary, Xinjiang is 
relatively backward economically and culturally. Ideologically, 
the region is also relatively closed and outdated. Therefore, 
it is especially urgent -- and more difficult also -- for us to 
emancipate our minds, change our ideas, intensify reforms, and 
open up wider to the outside world. The propaganda and 
ideological front, therefore, must provide theoretical guidance 
and support in public opinion to reform efforts so that the 
principle, policy, and measures of reform will strike roots in 
the hearts of the people and that cadres and people of all 
nationalities will understand, support, and join the reform 
efforts to ensure smooth implementation of all reform 
undertakings. 
  He said: Xinjiang is faced with a slew of difficulties and 
problems in the course of speeding up its economic development. 
This makes it even more necessary to make full use of propaganda 
and ideological work to help people get a correct understanding 
of Xinjiang's ongoing economic situation and its economic 
prospects. He pointed out: On balance, Xinjiang is stable 
socially and politically. Destabilizing factors, however, 
remain. Effective propaganda and ideological work is essential 
if we are to safeguard and maintain social stability and ensure 
lasting peace and stability. 
  In his speech, Abulaiti Abudurexiti called on the region's 
propaganda and ideological front to adhere closely to the 
fundamental principle of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and pay close attention to the following tasks 
now and in the future: 
  1. make more conscientious efforts in educating the cadres 
and the people with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and use this theory to 
guide Xinjiang's work in all areas; 
  2. get a firmer grasp of public opinion, guide it in a 
proper 
way, and create good public opinion that serves Xinjiang's 
reform, opening up, and stability; 
  3. promote ideological education with patriotism, 
collectivism, socialism, and national unity at its core and 
foster good mental outlook and social conduct; 
  4. give greater emphasis to the central theme; help our 
cultural, art, and publishing undertakings flourish; and 
encourage the creation of more works with healthy content for 
people of all nationalities; and 
  5. carry out in-depth external propaganda, improve the 
region's external propaganda in terms of the breadth and depth, 
and make it serve reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  Speaking of exercising effective party leadership over 
propaganda and ideological work and reinforcing the ranks of 
propaganda and ideological cadres, Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: 
Effective party leadership over propaganda and ideological work 
serves as a fundamental guarantee for the successful 
implementation of propaganda and ideological work. It also 
represents a new demand on party organizations at all levels in 
the new historical period. Party committees at all levels must 
place propaganda and ideological work high on their agenda, 
review it at regular intervals, and set priorities for different 
periods in a timely fashion. They should pay greater attention 
to helping and guiding propaganda departments focus on the key 
tasks and improve their work. 
  Abulaiti Abudurexiti noted: Generally speaking, Xinjiang's 
contingent of propaganda and ideological workers are dependable 
politically and hardworking. The regional party committee has 
full confidence in this contingent and has always placed great 
hopes on it. Party committees and government at all levels must 
show concern for comrades on the propaganda and ideological 
front politically, ideologically, and in terms of material 
benefits. Propaganda and ideological cadres should continuously 
enhance their sense of honor and responsibility for their work, 
live up to the trust of the party and the people, and make 
constant new progress in their work. 
  Leaders of the regional party committee, government, and the 
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, including Zhang 
Fusen, Keyum Bawudun, (Amina Apar), (Wufuer Abudula), Feng 
Dazhen, Sha Ming, and Ni Haomei, are attending the conference. 
Also present were officials in charge of propaganda and 
ideological work from the prefectures, cities, and counties; 
directors of propaganda departments from all over the region; 
and officials of the regional departments, commissions, offices, 
bureaus, and large state-owned enterprises in charge of 
propaganda work. Representatives to the regional conference on 
radio and television also attended the conference. (Li 
Kangning), head of the propaganda department of the regional 
party committee, relayed the guidelines of the national 
conference on propaganda and ideological work and other relevant 
meetings at this morning's session.

  [Text] Urumqi, May 27 (XINHUA) -- The Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region in the remote northwestern part of China 
promises China's oil and mineral future. 
  With exciting discoveries being made one after another in 
the 
Tarim Basin, the region is providing high hopes for China's oil 
future, at a time when the nation has become a net oil importer. 
  Over the past five years surveyors have found nine oilfields 
and 34 oil structures in the basin. The biggest discovery is a 
100-million-ton oilfield in the middle of the basin. 
  Experts estimate the basin's total reserves of oil and 
natural gas at 18 billion tons, about one fifth of the nation's 
total reserves. 
  Last year the basin produced 1.6 million tons of crude oil, 
ranking 11th in the country's top oilfields list. The 
authorities expect that the basin's oil production will reach 
2.1 million tons this year, and five million tons by the end of 
1996. 
  In another development, the region's gold production has 
climbed from the second from the bottom to the ninth among all 
the Chinese regions. 
  With gold deposits found in more than half of the region's 
80 
counties and cities, local sources said, the gold rush reminds 
people of that of the California in the last century. 
  Xinjiang is also rich in copper, a metal that is in short 
supply in China. The potential reserves are estimated at more 
than 10 million tons. Some experts predict that the Axili 
Copper Mine at the foot of the Altay Mountains will soon become 
the second-largest in China, after the Tongxing Mine in Jiangxi 
Province. 
  Figures released by the Xinjiang Bureau of Geology and 
Mining 
show that the region boasts reserves of 43 kinds of minerals, 
including oil, natural gas, gold, coal, copper, salt, precious 
stones and rare metals.

  [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan will make 
a stopover in the United States en route to Central America at 
the end of the month, Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu said 
Thursday [26 May]. 
  Chien made the remarks when answering questions from 
legislator Chen Chien-jen at a Legislative Yuan committee 
meeting. 
  The United States has promised to make arrangements for 
Lien's stay in the U.S., Chien said, adding that he personally 
hopes that bilateral relations between Taipei and Washington 
will be further boosted after June 3, when the U.S. has to make 
a final decision on whether to renew the most-favored-nation 
trade status of Beijing. Washington has been very cautious in 
handling matters concerning Taiwan and Mainland China, he noted. 
  Lien, scheduled to leave Taipei for El Salvador and 
Guatemala 
on May 30 for an eight-day trip, will attend the inauguration of 
newly elected Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol on June 
1 in San Salvador and begin a four-day visit in Guatemala City 
starting June 2.

  [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
on Thursday [26 May] applauded the passage by a U.S. Senate 
Committee of a resolution supporting Taiwan's bid to join the 
United Nations. 
  Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, in reply to an 
interpellation on the floor of the legislative chamber, said he 
felt gratified upon hearing the news and that he hopes the 
Clinton administration will pay heed to the resolution. 
  The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday 
unanimously passed a resolution saying that the United Nations 
should be encouraged to permit Taiwan to participate fully in UN 
activities. 
  The resolution, introduced by Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), now 
goes to the Senate floor for consideration by the full Senate. 
It also calls for cabinet-level exchanges between Taipei and 
Washington, which it said would be in the interests of both 
countries. 
  Taiwan in September made its first attempt to re-join the 
United Nations since it was forced out in 1971. Seven Latin 
American countries submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali in September, requesting that the ROC's UN 
bid be put on the agenda for the 48th General Assembly, but the 
request was voted down. 
  Chien told the lawmakers that a similar proposal will be 
submitted to the 49th General Assembly, but that a different 
strategy would be used -- namely, trying to get countries from 
different parts of the world to support the bid. 
  However, he also admitted that getting Taiwan admitted to 
the 
United Nations would not be an easy task, considering that the 
ROC maintains official diplomatic relations with only 29 
countries. He said the ROC could easier gain admission if it 
had diplomatic links with between 45 and 55 countries.

  [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Taiwan on Thursday [26 May] 
put a hold on a proposed plan for direct transportation links 
with Mainland China, apparently as a result a recent spate of 
incidents that have threatened fragile cross-strait ties. 
  In a revised position paper on Taiwan-mainland direct links, 
the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Taiwan will 
not consider initiating direct air and sea links with the 
mainland before its security wariness is soothed. 
  The paper says transportation links cannot be achieved 
before 
Beijing renounces its threat of force against Taiwan, lest 
Taiwan be lulled into thinking the links would remove that 
threat, thus sharply weakening Taiwan's ability to defend itself. 
  The paper said achieving direct links would be difficult 
anyway, given the political, legal and security barriers that 
the mainland has thrown up. 
  It disagreed with the proposal by the mainland that if 
cross-strait transport links proceed, ships from either side 
would not be allowed to hoist their national flags. It said 
that doing so would not eliminate the political, legal and 
security problems existing between the two sides, and in 
addition would be against both the International Civil Aviation 
Agreement and ROC civil aviation laws. 
  Underlining its much more vigilant attitude toward the 
mainland, the MAC added in the paper a survey of practices 
adopted by countries separated after World War II in regard to 
direct transportation links. It said East and West Germany and 
South and North Koreas did not begin direct transport links 
before hostilities between them were officially brought to an 
end. 
  Meanwhile, the paper asserted that Hong Kong will remain a 
"special territory" in ROC jurisdictional terms after the 
British colony is turned over to communist China in 1997, but 
added that direct air and sea links between Taiwan and Hong Kong 
will be sustained.

  [Text] The Taipei Association of Travel Agents told its 
members on Wednesday [25 May] that group tours to Mainland China 
are being resumed immediately. 
  To protect the interests of its members, the association 
said 
that it has won the permission from the cabinet-level Mainland 
Affairs Council to lift the ban on group tours to the mainland. 
The association reminded its members they should register their 
mainland tours with tourism bureau to complete the legal process. 
  Nevertheless, a number of mainland destinations continue to 
be listed as areas of high risk, and local travel agencies will 
not organize tours heading for such places, including the 
infamous Chientao [Qiandao] Lake in eastern mainland province of 
Chekiang [Zhejiang]. 
  Thirty-two people including 24 Taiwan tourists, six crew 
members, two mainland guides were robbed and burned to death in 
a pleasure boat ride on Chientao Lake March 31.

  [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Although the Taipei 
Association of Travel Agents lifted a ban on group travel to 
Mainland China Wednesday, the ROC [Republic of China] Consumers 
Foundation warned the public to avoid traveling to "high risk" 
places in the mainland. 
  Foundation Secretary-General Chiang Chih-chun said that 
personal safety is not the only factor to be considered in 
traveling to the mainland. He said that the public may have no 
way to file complaints if there is trouble because of the lack 
of agreement on travel safety and compensation between the two 
sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
  He noted that the bureau of tourism and the Taipei 
Association of Travel Agents have published a list of "high 
risk" locations in the mainland and travelers should use the 
list as a reference. 
  The travel agents lifted the self-imposed ban Wednesday [25 
May] after losing more than NT [New Taiwan] $700 million 
(U.S.$26 million), the officials said. The ban was imposed in 
response to the March 31 robbery and murder of 24 Taiwan 
tourists in Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province. 
  The association officials said that although the ban, 
imposed 
on May 1, was lifted, they did not expect group travel to the 
mainland to resume for a few months. 
  The association warned travel agencies to avoid high-risk 
areas such as Qiandao Lake, Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province, Tibet 
and Jiouzaigou in Sichuan Province.

  [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- A top Mainland Chinese 
tourism official admitted Thursday [26 May] that Mainland China 
lost more than Hong Kong and Taiwan in the aftermath of the 
March 31 Qiandao Lake tragedy in which 24 Taiwan tourists were 
killed. 
  Liu Yi, director of Beijing's National Tourism 
Administration, said during a tourism fair in Hong Kong that the 
mainland received some 50,000 fewer tourists from Taiwan in 
April and May, resulting in the loss of about US$50 million. 
  Spurred by the adverse impact, Liu said, Mainland Chinese 
authorities have begun a "nationwide overhaul" of tourist safety 
and decided to shorten the time it takes for the central 
authorities to take charge after the occurrence of major 
accidents. 
  Twenty-four Taiwan tourists were robbed and murdered in a 
pleasure boat fire on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province on March 
31. 
  The tourists, together with eight mainland crew members and 
tourist guides, were found burnt to death in a small room in the 
boat on April 1. Luggage and other belongings were missing. 
  News of the mishap was suppressed at first and then the 
Zhejiang authorities claimed it was an accident. Reporters, 
especially those from Taiwan were barred from the crime scene. 
Relatives of the victims, who were furious after mainland 
officials performed autopsies without their consent, were 
confined in a nearby hotel, and officials from the Taipei-based 
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) were three times refused 
permission to visit the mainland to probe the case. 
  Although the mainland authorities arrested three suspects 
and 
agreed to meet SEF officials and victim's relatives nearly 40 
days later, many questions surrounding the incident remain. 
  Since April, Taiwan has suspended cultural and educational 
exchanges, banned sightseeing trips, and is reviewing its 
economic policy toward the mainland in protest of the mainland's 
inappropriate handling of the incident. 
  Liu said he was happy to hear that a Taiwan travel agents 
association decided to lift the boycott on pleasure tours to the 
mainland on May 25. 
  Xu Heyung, an official from the Hangzhou Overseas Tourism 
Company who also attended the Hong Kong tourism fair, complained 
that "we have not had even a single tourist from Taiwan in May." 
  Another official from Hunan Province lamented that planned 
visits for nearly 40 sightseeing groups from Taiwan were 
canceled, resulting in the loss of US$900,000 in tourism revenue 
in the province alone. 
  Meanwhile, an official from the Hong Kong Travel Agency 
Association said since the Qiandao Lake incident, Hong Kong has 
witnessed a loss of some 30,000 Taiwan tourists who would 
previously make one or two-day stops in Hong Kong before or 
after their mainland visits. 
  Visa applications from Taiwan tourists to Hong Kong also 
dropped 40 percent since April, the Hong Kong official added.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister 
Chien Fu on Thursday [26 May] denied rumors that the Republic of 
China [ROC] has agreed to extend a U.S.$200 million loan to 
South Africa as part of Taipei's efforts to help shore up 
endangered bilateral ties. 
  Chien, replying to an interpellation by Democratic 
Progressive Party legislator Parris Chang, said the government 
had foreseen as long as three and a half years ago that drastic 
political changes would occur in South Africa, even though 
bilateral ties with the white-ruled government at that time were 
solid. 
  "We indeed had promised a U.S.$60 million loan to help South 
Africa finance a farming development project during F.W. De 
Klerk's tenure as the president, but the loan has not yet been 
given," Chien said. 
  The loan proposal was raised again when President Li 
Teng-hui 
visited South Africa to attend Nelson Mandela's presidential 
inauguration on May 10, Chien said, adding that both countries 
may re-start negotiations on the loan. 
  Chien emphasized that Li had not offered any new loans to 
South Africa during his visit, but did agree to help South 
Africa implement a vocational-training project. "South Africa 
will send people here to see for themselves how job-training 
projects are implemented," Chien said. 
  He added that the ROC has agreed to share with South Africa 
its successful experience in helping military personnel 
assimilate into society after retirement. 
  Many legislators here are against any new economic aid to 
South Africa on grounds that the Nelson Mandela-led African 
National Congress, which now rules the new government, has 
maintained close ties with Beijing for many years, and may 
eventually shift diplomatic recognition away from Taipei. 
  On the contrary, though, Li's visit, previously perceived as 
a last-ditch effort by Taiwan to salvage its relationship with 
South Africa, seems to have paid off handsomely. A confident 
Li, shortly after a meeting with Mandela, told a group of 
Chinese and representatives of Taiwan-owned companies in South 
Africa on May 11 that the bilateral ties between the two 
countries are strong and steady. 
  South Africa is the largest country of the 29 with which the 
ROC maintains official diplomatic ties.

  [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui on 
Thursday [26 May] called for the government and public to close 
ranks so as to accomplish the goals of national development. 
  Li made the call before concluding his five-day presence at 
the session of the National Assembly in which he solicited 
opinions from assembly members on national-affairs issues. 
  He said that Taiwan, behind the joint effort of the 
government and people, has built up its status in the 
international community behind the strength of its economy, but 
that to keep that status, it needs to face up to sharper 
international competition economically and the threat by Beijing 
to isolate it politically. 
  He said that regardless of party affiliation or birthplace, 
Taiwan citizens "should demonstrate the spirit of solidarity to 
pool together our strength and wisdom so as to accomplish 
political reforms, expand our diplomatic arena and increase our 
economic strength," President Li said. 
  During the past five days, 302 out of the 314 National 
Assembly members voiced their concerns on national affairs, 
especially regarding constitutional reforms, the national 
identity, cross- strait relations, foreign operations, judicial 
and educational reforms, and agricultural development. 
  The National Assembly began its three-month special session 
on May 2 to consider proposed amendments to the constitution and 
the nominations by Li of grand justices and the head of the 
Judicial Yuan.

  [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- The Taiwan economy is 
facing a host of potential threats, including both economic and 
non-economic factors, ranking officials said Friday [27 May]. 
  First of all, domestic investment, particularly in the 
manufacturing sector, remains sluggish. 
  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Li Shu-jeou said the number 
of 
newly established factories declined in the first quarter of 
this year and their aggregate paid-in capital also dropped as 
compared with the year-earlier. Machinery imports, an effective 
measure of investment activities, registered a 6 percent 
decrease during the January-March period. 
  Li said difficulties in land acquisition remain the greatest 
obstacle to private investment here. According to a recent 
survey by the US-based McKinsey consulting firm, Taiwan's 
industrial land prices are the second highest in Asia, behind 
only Hong Kong. 
  Li added labor shortages, inadequate government incentives 
and a growing "anti-commerce complex" have also discouraged 
manufacturers from making new investments at home. He cited a 
recent proposal by a township chief to levy "community 
development taxes" on the construction sector and the forced 
closure of the Makro Shopping Center in the Kaohsiung Industrial 
Zone as examples of the so-called "anti-commerce complex." 
  Wang Chao-ming, a minister without portfolio, said he is 
worried about possible power shortages because of the long delay 
in construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant and 
growing labor-management conflicts over work hours and insurance 
issues. 
  "If these problems cannot be resolved properly, our 
industrial production and overall economic growth will be 
adversely affected," Wang noted. 
  Kuo Wan-jung, also a minister without portfolio, said 
Taiwan's foreign trade has become even more unbalanced, with its 
reliance on the Mainland Chinese market increasing. 
  Taiwan's foreign trade surplus declined by nearly 70 percent 
in the first four months of this year compared to 1993. Worse 
yet, its trade deficit with Japan reached US$4.56 billion 
between January and April. Taiwan also incurred a US$760 
million trade deficit with Europe, while its trade surplus with 
the United States shrank to US$893.9 million. Taiwan managed to 
register a US$5.62 billion surplus in its trade with Hong Kong, 
a major conduit for indirect Taiwan-Mainland China trade, during 
the four-month period. 
  "All these figures point to changes in Taiwan's trade 
picture, with its exports to advanced countries, such as the US, 
Japan and European nations, declining while its reliance on the 
mainland market is rising," noted Kuo. 
  She also called attention to potential inflationary 
pressure, 
saying the nearly 2 percent depreciation of the new Taiwan 
dollar in recent months and rising oil and raw material prices 
in the international market may destabilize local commodity 
prices which would hinder economic growth. 
  However, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for 
Economic 
Planning and Development said he remains optimistic about 
Taiwan's economic prospects. "Our economy is undergoing a 
structural change, with technology-intensive industry playing an 
increasingly important role," Hsiao noted. 
  Industrial production rose 6.2 percent in the January-April 
period and heavy industry output grew an even more impressive 8 
percent from the year-earlier level, he added.

  [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- A North American trade 
mission is visiting Taiwan to seek potential investors in the 
North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) area. 
  The mission, composed of trade officials from San Diego, 
California and business leaders from Tijuana, Mexico, is led by 
San Diego Mayor Susan Golding. 
  During a seminar Friday [27 May] morning, mission members 
said San Diego and Tijuana offer all the privileges any investor 
could hope for including convenient transportation, tax 
exemptions, and the huge United States, Canadian and Mexican 
markets. 
  NAFTA, with the potential to create US$6 trillion in 
business 
and become the biggest trade block in the world, has already 
attracted some 600 companies to the free trade zones, said 
Daniel O. Pegg, president of the San Diego Economic Development 
Council. 
  Among the 600 manufacturers, some 100 are Asian companies, 
including Sony and Samsung, Pegg said. 
  Mayor Golding said she is confident that San Diego will turn 
itself into a "Hong Kong in North America" in the 21st century 
with its excellent investment climate and a large area of land.

as part of Taiwan's bid to enter the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Finance Ministry said Friday [27 
May]. 
  Standards for setting up plants will be the same for foreign 
and local manufacturers, a ministry official said. He added 
that the lifting of the ban on foreign alcohol production will 
be limited to low alcohol spirits and beer. Foreign companies 
will still be prohibited from producing hard liquors in Taiwan. 
  Famous alcohol manufacturers in Japan, Germany, and the 
Netherlands have expressed interest in setting up plants here, 
the official said. 
  This will be the first time in more than 40 years that 
Taiwan 
has opened its alcohol production to foreign countries. 
Currently, all domestic alcohol is produced exclusively by the 
provincial Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau, the official 
said. 
  A total of 1.24 billion bottles spirits were consumed across 
the island in fiscal 1993 with 95.35 percent produced locally 
and the remaining 4.65 percent imported, the bureau said.

  [Text] Brussels, May 26 (CNA) -- A Taiwan delegation 
composed of ten auto and motorcycle parts and component 
manufacturers is in Belgium to promote Taiwan products and seek 
cooperative opportunities. 
  Manager of Sanyes Automotive Industrial Co. Huang Sheng-chih 
said during an interview with CNA that Belgium, an important 
production center for the European auto industry, has been 
targeted by Taiwan manufacturers because it does not produce its 
own car brands. 
  Taiwan manufacturers can supply Belgium car assembly plants 
with parts and components and cooperate with Belgium OEM 
(original equipment manufacture) makers to tap the European and 
Asia-Pacific markets, Huang said. 
  During the tour arranged by the Far East Trade Service 
Center 
in Brussels, the Taiwan OEM manufacturers visited car assembly 
plants for Opel and Volkswagen and met with their Belgium 
counterparts to discuss trade opportunities. 
  Belgium imported some US$4.63 billion worth of car parts and 
components from abroad in 1993 with Taiwan supplying US$83 
million, or just under 2 percent of the total imports, Huang 
said. There is ample room for development of the Belgium 
market, he added. 
  After Belgium, the Taiwan delegation members will proceed to 
Germany and Britain to continue their European tour which also 
took them to Paris. Delegation members are scheduled to return 
to Taiwan on June 10.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Chinese 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said today that China has 
always opposed illegal emigration and will stop any such 
activity it discovers with effective measures. 
  In reply to a reporter's question at the foreign ministry 
news conference, Wu Jianmin said: China has also noticed that 
illegal emigration is an international phenomenon. Ringleaders 
of some illegal emigration rackets and their headquarters are 
not based in China. China would like to join hands with other 
countries in stopping illegal emigrants, especially cracking 
down on ringleaders and organizations involved in illegal 
emigration. 
  Wu said: If illegal migrants discovered are confirmed to be 
of China nationality, China would like to cooperate with 
concerned countries in bringing them back.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry 
said today that China welcomes U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
decision to renew China's most favored nation (MFN) trading 
status for 1994-95 and to delink the future MFN renewal from 
human rights issues. 
  In a statement just released here, the ministry said that 
Clinton's decision would create a favorable condition for 
further strengthening and expanding trade and economic 
cooperation between the two countries, helping improve and 
develop bilateral relations, and therefore is in the fundamental 
interest of the two countries and the two peoples. 
  Saying that the Chinese Government and Chinese people 
welcome 
Clinton's decision, the Chinese Foreign Ministry also urged an 
early lift of all the existing sanctions imposed on China by the 
United States.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
and people will, as always, firmly support African countries and 
peoples in their efforts to promote stability and development 
and strengthen its close cooperation with African countries in 
all fields, said Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen here today. 
  Qian told a reception marking the 31st anniversary of 
African 
Liberation Day hosted by heads of African diplomatic missions in 
Beijing that this year's celebration of liberation day has a 
special significance, for a new South Africa led by President 
Nelson Mandela has just been born. "It is a victory not only for 
the people of South Africa, but also for the peoples in the 
whole of Africa," he said. 
  The birth of the new South Africa signifies that the African 
people have finally broken the yoke of apartheid and racial 
discrimination, and its significance and impact have gone far 
beyond the borders of South Africa and the African Continent, 
said Qian. "It is an epoch-making event in the history of human 
civilization," he added. 
  Qian expressed his hope that under the leadership of the 
South African Government of national unity, the various 
political forces in South Africa will strengthen their unity and 
cooperation, join hands in building a stable, democratic, 
strong, prosperous and racially equal new South Africa, and make 
their own contributions to maintaining political independence 
and achieving economic revitalization in Africa. 
  The Chinese foreign minister also extended his 
congratulations on the achievements that the African countries 
have made in the past 31 years in promoting the process of 
economic integration in the continent and in other fields, under 
the banner of the Organization of African Unity (OAU). 
  He praised the OAU for its increasingly important role in 
maintaining peace and stability and in settling conflicts and 
disputes at regional or national level by good offices of the 
OAU. 
  "We sincerely wish African countries and peoples continued 
progress," said Qian. 
  Jean-Jacques Maurice, head of the African diplomatic corps 
and Madagascar ambassador to China, also spoke at the reception. 
  On the occasion, a speech made by President Muhammad Mubarak 
of Egypt, who is executive chairman of the OAU, was read out by 
Egyptian Ambassador to China Samir Burhan. 
  Officials from the International Liaison Department of the 
Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Chinese 
People's Association for Friendship With Foreign Countries, as 
well as diplomatic envoys from various foreign embassies in 
Beijing, attended the reception.

<F P=106> [Report: "In a Letter to NPC Standing Committee, Seven </F>
Student Movement Leaders Call for Rehabilitation of 4 June 
Incident"] 
  [Text] Seven former Beijing student movement leaders wrote 
a letter to the Standing Committee of the National People's 
Congress [NPC] yesterday, calling for rehabilitation of the 4 
June 1989 incident. The letter's full text is as follows: 
  "The Standing Committee of the NPC of the People's Republic 
of China: 
  Five years have elapsed since the democracy movement took 
place in 1989. As the citizens of the Republic who took an 
active part in the movement in the capacity of young students, 
we have never forgotten it, because we firmly believe that the 
movement has played an incalculable role in propelling history 
forward. On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the 
democracy movement of 1989, by exercising the political rights 
of citizens according to law, we openly express the following 
three strong appeals to the NPC Standing Committee, the supreme 
power organ of the state: 
  1. Reappraising the democracy movement of 1989. It was a 
patriotic democratic movement of the whole people with young 
students as the mainstay. During the movement, we always 
adhered to the principle of "peace, reason, and nonviolence." 
We deem it unjust for the government to determine the nature of 
the movement as "a disturbance and counterrevolutionary 
insurrection," and it must be reappraised as soon as possible. 
  2. Releasing all those who have been locked up until now 
because of the 4 June incident. 
  3. Giving special care and allowance to members of the 
bereaved families in the 4 June incident and properly solving 
the livelihood problem of those who were put in prison for their 
part in the 4 June incident and have now returned to society. 
  We maintain: The 4 June incident has formed an unavoidable 
"knot [jie 4815]" in the development of the Chinese nation's 
history. At a time when the drive for reform and opening up to 
the outside world has entered a crucial stage, like the 
government, we hope for a stable social environment. Moreover, 
solving the problem of 4 June incident and untying the "knot" in 
the people's hearts will help alleviate social contradictions, 
promote social stability, build the democratic legal system, and 
promote social progress. We sincerely hope that the government 
will boldly take this wise step by setting the interests of the 
nation and the future of the state above everything else. 
  It is our request that Standing Committee members will 
consider the above proposals." 
  The seven former student movement leaders who signed the 
letter were Wang Dan, Ma Shaofang, Zhai Weimin, Shao 
Jiang, Li Hai, Zheng Xuguang, and Guo Haifeng. 
  As the letter was sent on the evening of the fifth 
anniversary of the 4 June incident, this event is thus very 
sensitive.

<F P=106> [Speech by Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic </F>
cooperation, at "International Symposium on China's Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation Strategy in the 1990's": 
"Opportunities and Prospects: Basic, Tentative Ideas on 
China's Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Development in 
the 1990's"] 
  [Text] Respected Vice Premier Li Lanqing, respected 
guests, ladies and gentlemen: 
  On this occasion of the grand opening of the "International 
Symposium on China's Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation 
Strategy in the 1990's," please allow me, on behalf of the 
sponsoring organization -- China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] -- to extend a warm welcome and 
our heartfelt thanks to domestic and foreign guests, 
specialists, scholars, and personalities from the industrial and 
commercial circles who have come to attend this symposium at our 
invitation. This is the first time since reform and opening up 
began in China, and even since the founding of the people's 
republic, that MOFTEC, as a functional department under the 
State Council in charge of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation for the whole country, has held a high-level 
development strategy symposium in which domestic and foreign 
noted personalities and specialists have participated. Many 
noted personalities have come to the symposium despite many 
claims on their time and many other friends, who have friendly 
feelings toward China but who, for certain reasons, have not 
been able to come, have extended good wishes to the symposium. 
I believe that with the concerted efforts of Chinese and 
foreign participants, this symposium will achieve complete 
success and its fruitful results, will certainly be written into 
the history of China's trade, economic development, and 
exchanges with foreign countries. 
  I would now like to give, for our friends's discussion, a 
brief account of the general situation of the development of 
China's foreign trade and economic cooperation and of some 
tentative basic ideas for the development and reform of foreign 
trade and economic cooperation in the 1990's. 
  As our friends all know, in the 15 years since China began 
to 
implement the reform and opening up policy at the end of the 
1970's, the national economy has developed in a sustained 
manner, comprehensive national strength has gradually increased, 
and the people's living standards have constantly improved. 
Besides, these 15 years have also been a period in which China 
has continuously opened wider to the outside world and foreign 
trade and economic cooperation have developed rapidly. With the 
change of China's economy from a sealed and semi-sealed type 
into an open one, and the change from the planned economy to the 
socialist market economy, foreign trade and economic cooperation 
have occupied a more important position and played a greater 
role in the national economy and social development with each 
passing day. More and more people have come to realize, through 
their personal experience, that China's opening wider to the 
outside world and the rapid development of its foreign trade and 
economic cooperation have not only promoted the progress of 
modernization in China, strengthened comprehensive national 
strength, and brought actual benefits to the Chinese people but 
have also made important contributions to strengthening 
Sino-foreign cooperation and to the development and prosperity 
of the world economy and trade. 
  China's foreign trade and economic cooperation are an 
indispensable part of the world economic and trade system and 
are not much different in content from other countries. 
However, as far as concrete contents are concerned, we usually 
divide foreign trade and economic cooperation into six parts 
according to the nature and the needs of business management and 
of guidance work: 1) The import and export trade of 
commodities, that is, the tangible trade which is the foundation 
and focus of the entire foreign trade and economic cooperation 
of China; 2) the absorption of foreign capital, including the 
absorption of direct investment from outside the border, the 
setting up of various forms of enterprises with investment made 
by foreign businessmen, and various kinds of foreign loans; 3) 
the import and export of technology, that is, trade in 
technology; 4) contracting projects and providing labor services 
abroad; 5) economic and technical aid to foreign countries; and 
6) carrying out multilateral trade and economic cooperation with 
UN development systems and other international organizations 
concerned. 
  In the 15 years of reform and opening up, China's foreign 
trade and economic cooperation have always maintained a good 
momentum of development. Calculated according to comparable 
items, the import and export trade volume of the whole country 
has maintained an average annual growth rate of 16 percent. 
This rate is higher than the average annual growth rate of the 
GDP and is also higher that the growth rate of world trade 
during the same period. In 1993, the total volume of China's 
import and export trade reached $195.8 billion, of which exports 
accounted for $91.8 billion and imports, $104 billion. China's 
position in world trade had risen from 32d in 1978 to 11th and 
the percentage of China's total export volume in the world 
export trade had risen from 0.75 percent in 1978 to 2.5 percent 
in 1993. The product mix of export commodities has been 
continuously improved and in the early 1990's, we completed the 
change from exporting mainly primary products to mainly 
manufactured goods. The percentage of manufactured goods in 
exports rose to over 81 percent in 1993. The receipts and 
payments in foreign trade are quite normal. Since 1987, the 
state foreign exchange reserves have increased annually and by 
the end of 1993, the total volume of foreign exchange reserves 
was $21.2 billion. 
  Absorbing foreign capital is a new undertaking which has 
been 
developed since reform and opening up began. From 1979 to 1993, 
the amount of foreign capital absorbed, as stated in agreements, 
was $314.2 billion while $137.8 billion of foreign capital was 
actually used, of which the amount involved in agreements on 
foreign loans was $85.8 billion and $71.8 billion was actually 
used. The accumulated total of projects for direct investment 
made by foreign businessmen approved throughout the country was 
174,000, whose agreements involved $221.9 billion in foreign 
capital of $61.8 billion was actually invested. In recent 
years, the percentage of projects in China invested in by major 
foreign enterprises and famous transnational corporations has 
increased and the ways of cooperation in investment have become 
increasingly diversified. By the end of 1993, foreign-invested 
enterprises across the country which had begun operations 
numbered 83,000. They are playing a positive role in the 
economic and social development of our country. Last year, the 
output value of foreign-invested enterprises exceeded 300 
billion yuan and their import and export volume reached $67 
billion, accounting for one-third of the country's total import 
and export volume. The number of people employed by 
foreign-invested enterprises in China exceeds 10 million. 
  At the same time, China has also made great developments in 
exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries in the fields 
of technology and labor services. Foreign trade and economic 
cooperation are developing from the old pattern with unitary 
contents, narrow channels, and relatively low levels to a 
pattern of "extensive trade and economic cooperation" in which 
commodities, capital, technology, and labor are closely linked 
and promote one another. 
  The 15 years since reform and opening up began is a period 
in 
which China has made important developments in multilateral and 
bilateral trade and economic relations with foreign countries. 
For many years, we have constantly deepened the reform of the 
foreign trade and economic cooperation structure in accordance 
with the demands of the establishment of the socialist market 
economy structure and with international standards. On the 
other hand, we have upheld the principle of equality and mutual 
benefit and made efforts to develop various forms of 
multilateral and bilateral trade and economic relation with all 
the countries and regions of the world. By the end of 1993, 
China had established trade and economic relations with more 
than 220 countries and regions of the world and had joined many 
international economic organizations, including the World Bank, 
the International Monetary Fund, and the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation Forum. Talks on restoring China's status as a 
signatory state in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) are currently being held. The development of 
multilateral and bilateral trade and economic relations has 
provided a good external environment for reform, opening up, and 
modernization in China. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, in the course of developing our 
foreign 
trade and economic cooperation, various localities and 
departments in our country have closely cooperated with one 
another and forged ahead in unity. At the same time, many 
international organizations and friends in foreign industrial 
and commercial circles and other circles have cooperated with us 
in a friendly manner. I would like to take this opportunity to 
express our heartfelt thanks to Chinese and foreign friends who 
have made great efforts to support us and cooperate with us. 
  We are fully aware that China has carried out modernization 
at relatively low economic and technological levels and on a 
relatively poor foundation in various aspects. Although China 
has made great development in foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, we still cannot meet the needs of the situation for 
the socialist modernization of our country. Viewed from the 
trends of developments in the world economy and trade, and from 
the conditions of various aspects of Sino-foreign exchanges, the 
potential for development in China's foreign trade and economic 
cooperation is still quite great. 
  At present, the level of China's foreign trade and 
economic cooperation is still low and the ties and exchanges 
between China's economy and the world economy are still 
insufficient. In particular, the national economy is developing 
at a relatively high speed, the growth in exports lacks 
strength, and the pressure of balancing receipts and payments in 
trade is increasing. Last year, there was a deficit of $12.2 
billion. In a certain sense, if this situation is not changed, 
it will affect the expansion of all trade and economic exchanges 
with foreign countries and will not be conducive to giving full 
play to the tremendous potential of the market in China. The 
investment environment in China has apparently improved but, to 
meet the needs of further investment and cooperation properly, 
we must make greater efforts to continue to perfect the 
investment environment. We must also further improve the 
quality and raise the level of projects invested in by foreign 
businessmen. A new round of reforms in the foreign trade and 
economic cooperation structure is being carried out in China 
and, in the course of such reform, the tasks of maintaining good 
operational procedures, standardizing the behavior of 
enterprises, and changing the operational mechanism in foreign 
trade enterprises will also be very heavy. 
  The 1990's will be a crucial period of modernization in 
China 
in which China wants to attain the second-step strategical goal 
of modernization and to upgrade the national economy on the 
basis of optimizing structure, increasing economic results, and 
speeding up technological progress. The tasks are very heavy 
and arduous. 
  In the 1990's, the supply and demand conditions in China's 
economy will change greatly. With the accelerated establishment 
of the socialist market economy structure, the environment 
system for economic operation in China will also see a series of 
important changes. A conspicuous characteristic is the economic 
operation mechanism will move further toward the rules of 
international economic operations. It can be expected that in 
the course of doing so, China will encounter many opportunities 
and challenges in the development of its foreign trade and 
economic cooperation. 
  What should particularly be pointed out is that the 14th CPC 
National Congress made it clear the goal of the reform of the 
economic structure of our country was the establishment of the 
socialist market economy structure; and the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee also comprehensively 
and specifically worked out the magnificent blueprint for the 
establishment of the socialist market economy structure in our 
country. At present, a new round of comprehensive and 
coordinated reforms of the economic structure is being carried 
out in China. It is planned that the basic framework of the 
socialist market economy structure will be established before 
2000 and the reforms of the foreign trade structure will also be 
further deepened in a comprehensive manner. This series of 
reforms will totally change the environment systems for the 
operation of the economy and foreign trade and economic 
cooperation of China, lead to the gradual establishment of a 
mechanism for foreign trade operations which conforms with the 
current rules governing the international economy, and provide a 
guarantee in terms of system to ensure the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development [chixu kuaisu jiankang fazhan 2170 4958 1816 
6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation. In the middle and late 1990's, China's national 
economy will still maintain a relatively rapid growth and 
foreign trade and economic cooperation will also have a more 
solid material foundation for development. 
  In the middle and late 1990's, with the further development 
of the multipolarization of the world politics and economy, 
peace and development will still be the main theme of the times, 
economic competition will gradually replace political and 
military confrontation and become the main melody of the times, 
and competition in science and technology will become an 
important foundation for competition in comprehensive national 
strength. Since the end of the Cold War, more and more people 
with breadth of vision have realized that trade and economic 
cooperation have become an increasingly important field in 
international exchanges today. Because of the influence of 
factors such as a widened gap between the north and the south, 
continual regional conflicts, and the debt crisis, it will be 
difficult for the "golden situation" of the 1960's and the 
1970's to reappear in the world economy and trade. Nevertheless, 
the general trend of the world economy and trade in the 1990's 
will be a growing one. The economy of the Asia-Pacific region, 
mainly East Asia and the West Pacific region, will maintain a 
relatively fast growth rate. At present, the pace of the 
economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and the 
subregion is tending to further quicken. Therefore, with the 
new achievements made in the readjustment of the economic 
policies of various countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the 
economic growth of the Asia-Pacific region, mainly East Asia, 
will continue to be faster than other parts of the world in the 
1990's and the region will become an increasingly important 
motive force promoting the development of the world economy. 
This has become the consensus of almost all countries and of 
most specialists. This situation is very gratifying to us. 
  Another gratifying matter in international trade is the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks which attracted 
worldwide attention and the signing of the final document. 
After that, the international multilateral trade structure was 
further strengthened. We hope that within that multilateral 
framework, various forms of trade protectionism can be curbed 
and the global trade environment can become more harmonious and 
open. I think this will be greatly welcomed by all our friends 
who are engaged in trade and economic cooperation with China. 
  The following factors in the course of the development of 
China's foreign trade and economic cooperation in the 1990's are 
quite worthy of attention: A) The quickened development of the 
tendency to form regional groups in the world economy will 
inevitably lead to the tendency of the partial replacement of 
interregional trade by trade within a region, that is, the 
so-called "trade shift effect." Besides, trade protectionism 
will be very popular in many fields of international trade. 
Some countries will even politicize economic relations, 
advocate unilateralism, and exert pressure on their trade 
partners through unilateral measures. This will directly 
threaten the operation of the multilateral trade structure and 
will be quite harmful to the development of China's foreign 
trade and economic cooperation. B) As a developing country, 
China's production and technological levels are low, the 
economic development of different regions and trades is quite 
uneven, and China is still at a relatively low level in the 
international economic and trade system. C) In the course of 
changing the domestic economic and trade structure, conflicts 
between the new structure and the old are unavoidable. This 
means that in the course of implementing the strategy of the 
development of foreign trade and economic cooperation, we must 
properly handle the relationship between reform and development. 
  Faced with the general situation of the international 
economic and trade development, China should, in the 1990's, 
seize the opportunities, take up the challenges, formulate, in 
light of China's reality and extensively absorbing and using as 
reference successful international experience, a correct 
strategy for foreign trade and economic cooperation to give 
guidance to the development and reform of its foreign trade and 
economic cooperation, make overall planning, and painstakingly 
implement such planning in a bid to attain the strategic goal of 
speeding up the process of modernization. 
  According to the new demands put forward by the domestic and 
foreign environments and the modernization of China in the 
1990's, considering the needs of further deepening reform, 
opening wider to the outside world, and promoting development 
and in light of the reality of the development of foreign trade 
and economic cooperation, China must, in its foreign trade and 
economic cooperation in the 1990's, implement the "big economic 
and trade strategy" which is based on import and export trade; 
enables mutual infiltration and coordinated development of 
commodities, capital, technology, and labor service cooperation 
and exchanges; has the joint participation of departments of 
foreign trade and economic cooperation, production, science, 
technology, and finance; and which upgrades foreign trade and 
economic cooperation enabling it to give better play to its 
strategical role of promoting economic growth, structural 
readjustment, and technological progress, and increasing 
economic results. 
  We shall further develop foreign trade and economic 
cooperation in depth and in breadth to form a pattern which is 
open, through various channels, to the whole country and the 
outside world in all directions and in various fields. On this 
basis we shall, in accordance with the requirements of 
international trade standards and norms, further reform the 
economic structure, especially the foreign trade and economic 
cooperation structure, speed up the change of the enterprise 
operational mechanism, speed up the convergence of the domestic 
economy and the world economy, and establish a basic pattern of 
China's open-type economic system. 
  We shall speed up the general merging of various businesses 
of foreign trade and economic cooperation, mainly the merging of 
foreign trade, utilization of foreign capital, making investment 
abroad, and other businesses of economic and technical 
cooperation with foreign countries, and we shall bring about an 
overall and coordinated development of commodity trade, 
technology trade, and service trade. With the prerequisite of 
giving support to and actively participating in the global 
multilateral trade system, we shall strive to bring about an 
organic integration of multilateral trade and economic 
cooperation, regional trade and economic cooperation, and 
bilateral trade and economic cooperation, and form joint forces 
as a whole for China's participation in international 
competition. With the reform of the management structure and 
operational mechanism for exchange rates, taxation, and tariffs, 
we shall combine the macroregulation and control of foreign 
trade and economic cooperation with the macroregulation and 
control of the national economy, and regard the sustained and 
stable development of foreign trade and economic cooperation and 
the maintenance of a balance in international receipts and 
payments as the direct target of state macroeconomic regulation 
and control. 
  To meet the demands of economic development in foreign trade 
and economic cooperation in the 1990's, we shall take the road 
of intensive development, make efforts to improve quality, 
further implement the strategy of "winning victories with 
quality," make greater efforts to "optimize structure, speed up 
technological progress, and increase economic results," and 
strive to complete, before 2000, the change from an export 
product mix which mainly consists of textile products to an 
export product mix which mainly consists of electrical, 
mechanical, heavy industry, chemical, and new- and high-tech 
products; and the change from an export product mix which mainly 
consists of rough-machining and low value-added products to an 
export product mix which mainly consists of finished-machining 
and high value-added products, bringing about a relatively big 
improvement of the structure and economic result of foreign 
trade and considerably improving the quality and economic 
results in using foreign capital, investment abroad, and other 
businesses of foreign economic and technological cooperation. 
  Market pluralization is an important principle for expanding 
and developing our foreign trade and economic cooperation. The 
goal of market pluralization is, through our efforts, to 
gradually form a rational market structure with the Asia-Pacific 
market as the focus, peripheral markets as the support, and with 
a balanced layout of markets in the developed countries and 
those of the developing countries, to maintain a balanced and 
coordinated development of foreign trade and economic relation 
and to develop foreign trade and economic relations in all 
directions. 
  We shall promote the rational division of work among the 
various localities. In the 1990's, in the links of the 
development of export-oriented industries and foreign trade and 
economic operation of various localities in China, we will form 
a work division pattern which facilitates the division and work 
and cooperation and which can give full play to the strong 
points of the various localities and enables them to have their 
own characteristics. We shall basically eliminate the 
irrational phenomenon of duplication in the development of 
export-oriented industries in various localities, promote the 
formation of a unified domestic market, reduce contradictions 
and conflicts between localities, and form a pattern of rational 
and coordinated development of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation between various localities. 
  In accordance with the basic demands of reform, opening up, 
and modernization in China in the 1990's, we shall adopt a 
series of important, practical, and effective measures and 
strive to attain the strategic goal of China's foreign trade and 
economic cooperation satisfactorily. 
  Active participation in the global multilateral trade system 
and making efforts to develop multilateral trade and economic 
relations have a direct bearing on the improvement in the 
external environment for China's foreign trade and economic 
cooperation. China firmly supports the international 
multilateral trade system represented by GATT and is stepping up 
work in talks on restoring its status as a GATT signatory state. 
China's determination to participate in the international 
multilateral system is very firm and we have made tremendous 
efforts in this respect. In accordance with the requirements of 
international trade standards and norms, China has carried out a 
series of important reforms in the foreign trade structure, its 
market access conditions have markedly improved, and the 
transparency of its economic and trade system has greatly 
increased. Through a new round of reforms which begin this 
year, China's economic and trade structure and the international 
rules will further converge. The increase in the extent of 
opening China's market has a positive impact on the development 
of the world economy and trade. 
  As we all know, China comprehensively participated in the 
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks, made positive 
contributions to the success of the talks, and signed the final 
document from the talks last month. Besides, the conclusion of 
the Uruguay Round of talks has also added new meaning to China's 
reentry to GATT. Talks on China's reentry to GATT have lasted 
for eight years. We are willing to work, together with all 
signatories, for strengthening of the global multilateral 
economic and trade system and to make due contributions to the 
prosperity and development of the world economy and trade. I 
would like to take this opportunity to thank the great majority 
of signatories for their support for China's reentry to GATT and 
hope certain signatories will earnestly fulfill their promises 
and actively give support to China's reentry to GATT. 
  I have already mentioned that, in recent years, the tendency 
to form regional groups in the world economy has been developing 
at a higher speed. We hope that the establishment and operation 
of regional economic and trade groups and the global 
multilateral trade standards, can converge and these groups 
should not become exclusive protective organizations. 
Proceeding from this point, China takes a positive attitude 
toward the strengthening of economic cooperation in the 
Asia-Pacific region. We stand for following the principle of 
"mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, opening to each 
other, and common prosperity" in carrying out economic 
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and do not agree with 
trade protectionism. On the basis of strengthening the global 
multilateral trade system, we will promote deepening economic 
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and make greater 
contributions to the growth of the world economy and trade. 
  To better develop multilateral and bilateral trade and 
economic relations, we will continue to follow the principle of 
equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation, oppose 
exerting pressure on another party in trade and economic 
exchanges, and disagree with unilateralism or other forms of 
trade protectionism. 
  We will constantly deepen the reform of the foreign trade 
and 
economic cooperation structure in accordance with the demands of 
the operation of China's socialist market economy and the rules 
for the operation of the international economy. At present, 
while promoting reforms in the taxation and financial fields, we 
are making efforts to carry out a new round of reforms of the 
foreign trade structure. The core of the reforms is to bring 
about a unified foreign exchange rate and to institute a unified 
and managed floating renminbi exchange rate system based on 
market supply and demand. The new structure has operated 
normally for the past four months and the momentum of the 
development of import and export trade is very good. This has 
further strengthened our confidence and determination to deepen 
the reforms and to carry them out to the end. It can be 
expected that following this round of reforms, the operational 
mechanism of China's foreign trade enterprises will become more 
standardized and macromanagement will become more scientific and 
standardized. We will basically complete the establishment of 
the framework of a new foreign trade structure in the last few 
years of this century. 
  China upholds the policy of basically balanced import and 
export trade, that is, on the basis of increasing exports, China 
opens its domestic market to all trade partners and opposes all 
forms of trade protectionism. We will adopt positive measures 
to achieve a balanced development of import and export trade. 
This means we will make efforts to increase sources of export 
goods, widen trade channels, develop foreign markets to increase 
exports, and increase the capacity for payment for imports in a 
bid to achieve a positive trade balance. I hope our trade 
partners can adopt an objective and fair attitude toward China's 
exports, abolish discriminative treatment against China, 
earnestly observe international trade rules and norms, and 
safeguard the fair and open multilateral trade system to promote 
a sustained development of international trade. We understand 
that the industrial and commercial circles in all countries of 
the world have a keen interest in the tremendous potential of 
the market in China. However, it is quite evident that only with 
a sustained growth in exports will the momentum of the growth in 
China's imports be maintained and the tremendous potential of 
the market in China tapped. According to the needs of 
modernization, the total volume of China's imports will reach $1 
trillion in the coming seven years. 
  Active and effective absorption of investment by foreign 
businessmen is an important aspect of China's efforts to expand 
foreign trade and economic exchanges. We will maintain the 
continuity of our policy toward foreign capital and continue to 
encourage foreign businessmen to make investment in China. We 
will sum up experience, keep abreast of the new situation, and 
give clearer guidance in terms of production sectors for foreign 
businessmen to make investment. In accordance with the 
industrial policy of China, we will absorb more foreign capital 
for carrying out projects at a higher technological level and on 
a relatively larger scale, encouraging foreign businessmen to 
use various forms proven to be effective abroad to make 
investment in China's basic industries and infrastructure so 
that investment by foreign businessmen and China's strategy for 
economic development can converge. In this way, we will also be 
able to provide better conditions for ensuring the interests of 
foreign businessmen in making investment. 
  In the course of deepening reforms of the economic and trade 
structure, we have always paid attention to respecting and 
protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign 
businessmen. I would like to tell you that in the new round of 
reforms of the foreign trade structure, we will institute the 
foreign exchange settlement and sale system in state-owned 
foreign trade enterprises and will adopt a transitional method 
for all foreign-invested enterprises. That is, we will allow 
them to continue to keep their spot exchange account to 
facilitate their production and operation, including operational 
activities of imports and exports. Another example is that in 
the new round of reforms of the taxation structure, the tax 
burden of foreign-invested enterprises will not increase on the 
whole and we have worked out corresponding compensation methods 
for individual enterprises whose tax burden has actually 
increased, to ensure that foreign businessmen can really enjoy 
the preferential conditions stated in the laws of China and in 
agreements on cooperation. None of our preferential policies 
for foreign businessmen to make investment have changed. We 
will improve unremittingly the investment environment and create 
conditions for foreign businessmen to enjoy the same "treatment 
as for Chinese nationals." We will make greater efforts to 
introduce technology, improve the methods and structure of 
introducing technology, and take an open road of introduction; 
at the same time, we will energetically develop international 
technological cooperation and increase technology imports. In 
this field, we will constantly raise the level of protection for 
intellectual property so that trade in technology will develop 
along a healthy and standardized track. 
  We will continue to contract more projects abroad and to 
develop the market and the scope of business and cooperation of 
labor service. We will also continue to increase the 
international competitive power of China's service trades such 
as financial insurance for foreigners, transportation for 
foreigners, and contracting labor serviced abroad. We will keep 
abreast of the development of international trade and gradually 
open service trades to foreign countries. At the same, we will 
make great efforts to raise the level of service trades. While 
opening China's service markets to the outside world, we will 
make efforts to develop the international markets, nurture and 
develop service trades with strong points, raise China's service 
trades to a higher level, and achieve a basic balance in the 
receipts and payments in China's service trades. 
  We are making great efforts to strengthen building of the 
legal system regarding foreign trade and economic cooperation to 
ensure foreign trade and economic enterprises operate according 
to law and to constantly raise the level of macromanagement 
according to law. China's first "Foreign Trade Law" has been 
submitted to the ongoing Seventh Meeting of the Eighth National 
People's Congress Standing Committee for examination and 
discussion; and laws and decrees to supplement the "Foreign 
Trade Law" are being drafted. Within three years, we will 
basically establish a relatively sound law and decree system for 
foreign trade and economic cooperation. To meet the demands of 
the operation of the new tax and financial systems, we will 
firmly grasp the improvement and perfection of the export tax 
reimbursement system and strengthen and perfect the foreign 
trade credit system and the risk mechanism in accordance with 
current international practices. 
  In the course of developing foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, we will continue to give play to the strong points 
of coastal areas in the new situation. At the same time, we 
will speed up work to open the hinterland faster to the outside 
world and to bring about a situation wherein the coastal areas 
and the hinterland complement each other in terms of their 
strong points and develop together. The coastal areas were 
opened to the outside world earlier and the level of their 
economic development is also relatively higher. From now on, we 
will give support to coastal areas so that they can optimize 
their structure at a relatively higher starting point and can 
continue to develop. Regarding the vast hinterland, we will 
concern ourselves more with it and give it more support. We 
will promote development with opening up, pay special attention 
to giving play to the resources of the hinterland, encourage 
foreign businessmen to make investment in exploiting resources, 
and gradually establish hinterland industries which have a 
competitive edge. We will also use successful practices in 
regional development abroad for reference and will adopt 
necessary preferential policies for opening up and developing 
the hinterland. The central and western regions are the hopes 
for China's economic development in the next century. 
Farsighted and enterprising entrepreneurs will find the regions 
full of opportunity and hope if they make study tours there. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the world is advancing toward the 21st 
century and opening up, readjustment, and development are the 
common tasks of the world economy. China's policy of opening to 
the outside world is firm and unshakable and China's 
determination to further develop its trade and economic 
relations with all countries in the world is also firm and 
unshakable. China will make increasingly important 
contributions to the prosperity of the world economy and trade 
through continuously opening wider to the outside world and 
developing its foreign trade and economic relation with other 
countries in depth. We sincerely hope that all Chinese and 
foreign noted personalities, specialists, scholars, and 
entrepreneurs present will put forward their valuable 
suggestions and proposals on developing China's foreign trade 
and economic cooperation in the late 1990's, will increase 
exchanges and cooperation with us, and will help us improve our 
work and raise our level of policymaking decisions. Finally, I 
want to express my sincere thanks again to all present and to 
personalities from all countries, regions, and international 
organizations in the world who have enthusiastically shown 
concern for, and given support to, China's foreign trade and 
economic cooperation. 
  I wish our guests good health and I wish the symposium 
success. 
  That is all. Thank you.
