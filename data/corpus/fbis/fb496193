  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Build a bridge so that 
you can cross a river, build electric power so that you can no 
longer be poor -- it is a saying being passed on throughout 
China from village to village. 
  To the farmers living in mountainous regions and wishing to 
have enough to eat and wear, this will not be just a dream. The 
Chinese Government has vowed to redouble efforts to send 
electric light to every county, to 95 percent of rural 
households by 2000. 
  "China will make preferential policies concerning loans, 
taxation and revenues in this regard to speed up electric power 
projects to aid the poor in the vast countryside," said a 
government official. 
  Meanwhile, China will implement a "source plan" to make 
comprehensive use of water sources in mountainous areas, for 
meeting the needs of people and livestock, for irrigation and 
for generation of electricity. 
  According to statistics, 97 percent of the country's towns 
and 89 percent of its rural households had been electrified by 
1993. Per capita consumption of electricity in the countryside 
rose to 275 kwh from less than 65 kwh in 1978, bringing the 
gross figure to 249 billion kwh, or 35 percent of the country's 
total consumption. 
  However, 28 counties and some 120 million of the rural 
population in China remain without electricity, mainly in eight 
areas such as eastern Inner Mongolia, Guizhong and the Three 
Gorges. Among them, some eight million people even don't have 
enough to eat and wear. 
  It has become obvious that the construction of hydroelectric 
power facilities and the electrification of China's rural areas 
have become priorities for farmers to overcome poverty. 
  China announced the building of facilities to electrify a 
batch of counties in the early 1980s. By 1989, altogether 109 
counties had met the requirements for rudimentary 
electrification. The second batch of 200 counties is now 
constructing power grids. 
  As a result, more than 33 million rural people have 
benefited 
from the projects in getting electricity and drinking water. 
Moreover, government revenues of those counties doubled within 
the five years of the electrification campaign, and redoubled in 
the ensuing three years. 
  The ongoing National Electrification Work Conference has set 
the target of building a total of 1,000 electrified counties 
across the country by the turn of this century. 
  However, the shortage of capital, among others, is seriously 
threatening the realization of this objective. "Despite 
increased investments in the construction of electric power for 
rural areas," explained an official, "The gap between supply and 
demand expands." 
  Wang Shucheng, vice-minister of power industry, said that 
about 30 billion yuan is needed simply to get electric power 
through to the areas and households without electricity -- 
averaging more than four billion yuan each year in the next 
seven years. 
  The State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade 
Commission and the Ministry of Power Industry proposed phased 
arrangements of construction projects after careful planning and 
selection. 
  They suggested the expansion of big grids be the main trend 
for covering the rural areas with electric power and reasonable 
increases in investment be made to innovate rural power grids 
and small hydroelectric and coal-fired power stations and to set 
up demonstration projects in using new sources of energy. 
  In addition, they said, more channels should be opened for 
the flow of capital in this direction and joint power 
construction should be encouraged.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 25 May, Jiang Chunyun, secretary 
of the provincial party committee, delivered a speech at the 
study meeting sponsored by the central study group under the 
provincial party committee. In his speech he put forward that 
to meet the demand of establishing the systems of socialist 
market economy, we should further enhance studies in the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; in the 
theories of socialist market economy; and in basic knowledge and 
the knowledge of modern science and technology. We should also 
upgrade the consciousness of implementing the party's basic line 
and improve the capability of participating in and having the 
socialist market economy well in hand. 
  From 24 to 25 May, the central study group under the 
provincial party committee concentrated its efforts on studying 
the viewpoint of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to 
emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts and the 
viewpoint in which the essence of socialism is to emancipate and 
develop productive forces. At the same time, the group, by 
bearing the province's reality in its mind, discussed the issues 
of shifting the business mechanism of enterprises; establishing 
modern enterprise systems; and accelerating the economic 
development; in line with the ideology of Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
with regard to deepening the reform and broadening the opening 
up. The central study group also heard the special-topic report 
given by Hong Hu, vice minister of restructuring economy, with 
regard to establishing modern enterprise systems. 
  In his speech, Jiang Chunyun said: The works of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping and particularly the Third Volume of Deng Xiaoping's 
Selected Works represent the great and important development of 
Marxism and the scientific system of theories. In his works, 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping gives scientific, clear, accurate, and 
meticulous expositions to the issues of what is of socialism and 
how to build socialism from theories to practice. These 
expositions have dealt with a series of important problems faced 
by the party in leading the cause of building socialism. 
Currently, there are many issues that are worth being studied 
by us. Of these issues, a prominent one is to implement the 
resolution adopted at the 14th CPC Congress with regard to 
establishing the systems of socialist market economy and turning 
the traditional planned economy into a market one. Successful 
transformation of the economy will enable full exposure of the 
superiority of socialism, reinforcement of national strength, 
and enrichment of the people's wealth.

<F P=106> [By N. C. Renoir in Guangzhou] </F>
  [Text] A nationwide disobedience campaign appears to be 
gathering steam among China's underground Christian churches in 
the wake of new religion laws passed in January. A renewed 
order to register all unauthorised places of worship has been 
ignored by virtually every one of the underground "house 
churches", according to the Reverend Samuel Lamb Xiangao, the 
head of the Damazhan house church in Guangzhou. "On the surface 
the new laws say we can control ourselves. But we hear that 
every locality has its own laws so nobody wants to register," 
Lamb, 69, said at his cramped two-floor church in central 
Guangzhou. 
  House church leaders from Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and 
northern 
China who visited the Damazhan church this month told Lamb they 
knew of no churches which have registered. Beijing's best known 
house church leader, the Reverend Yuan Xiangchen, who has spent 
time in jail for refusing government controls on his church, 
also pledged defiance, according to Lamb. 
  But with Beijing apparently determined to control the 
mushrooming underground churches--which have an estimated 30 to 
60 million regular members compared to only 7 million for the 
official "Three Self" Protestant Christian church--Lamb believes 
it may only be a matter of time before a crackdown comes. The 
local Three Self church in Guangzhou began handing out copies of 
the new law on the street last week, an ominous sign in Lamb's 
view. "I have heard the local PSB (public security bureau) is 
planning another attack on our church," he says. "But if it 
comes, it won't be until after the June decision," he said, 
referring to the US government decision on renewing trade 
benefits for China due to be announced on June 3. 
  Sixty PSB officers raided the Damazhan church in February 
1990, confiscating all bibles and setting up a 24hour 
encirclement to prevent further services. The church was not 
silent for long though. Two months after the raid it was again 
serving a weekly complement of about 800 worshippers. 
  Damazhan, where Lamb has lived since 1930, is perhaps the 
best-known house church in China. The narrow, rickety building 
has seen a steady stream of foreign worshippers, diplomats and 
reporters since gaining prominence after the 1990 shutdown. The 
US assistant secretary of state for human rights, John Shattuck, 
squeezed into a wooden pew for a half-hour chat with Lamb last 
October. The church has faced a standing threat of demolition 
of the Damazhan Lane buildings since 1991. But Lamb says this 
is unlikely for a year or more, and he has already began 
scouting future sites. He said the congregation now numbers 
about 1,400. 
  While defiance reigns with respect to the new registration 
order, it also appears that the new law governing the religious 
activities of foreigners in China has won veiled but widespread 
support among the underground Christian movement. "It's not so 
good for foreigners to preach. If a Chinese can preach, then we 
should do it ourselves," said Lamb. Lamb said the recent case 
of an American, Dennis Balcombe--who was expelled from Henan 
province in February along with six other members of his Hong 
Kong-based church--"had an effect around the world. Foreigners 
should not be so active. If everyone were as active as 
Balcombe, then the police would not allow us to continue," he 
said. 
  But as the underground movement operates mainly without 
foreign involvement, Lamb says the issue of foreign preachers 
does not pose a great threat. "The government always accuses us 
of relying on foreigners. But we say this is not true," he 
said. "One of the Three Selfs (doctrines) is self-preaching, 
and that is what we do. We are a Three Selfs church, but an 
unregistered one."

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- The Beijing municipal 
legislature has passed a law to put a stop to encroachment on 
arable land. 
  Beijing had a total area of 16,807 sq km, including 6,100 sq 
km of arable land, in 1952. But this dropped to 4,100 sq km of 
arable land in 1993. Now the city has an average of 393 sq m of 
arable land per capita, which is the lowest in China. 
  The shrinking of arable land is due largely to construction, 
according to Chen Shudong, director of the Beijing Bureau of 
Land Administration. He said the amount of land used for 
construction has been increasing in recent years. Last year it 
was a record 40 sq km. 
  The land resources of Beijing are not only worsening in 
quantity but also in quality. 
  Despite the decrease of arable land, Beijing's annual grain 
consumption is around 5.20 million tons, half of which is 
transported in from other cities or provinces. 
  Beijing has a population of 10,511,800, as well as a 1.5 
million floating population. 
  At a recent meeting, the standing committee of the tenth 
municipal people's congress has adopted regulations on 
protection of farmland in Beijing. 
  The 30-article regulations stipulate the principles on 
classification of farmland, the compensation system for the land 
occupied by the state construction projects and legal duties in 
this field.

  [Text] On the morning of 26 May, Yue Qifeng, secretary of 
the provincial party committee, visited a certain combined arms 
army of the provincial military district stationed in Harbin and 
the officers and men of a certain army institute in Harbin. He 
encourages cadres and soldiers to emancipate their minds, study 
the major tactics well, and make contributions to Heilongjiang's 
social stability and economic development. 
  Acting Governor Tian Fengshan, Shan Rongfan, deputy 
secretary 
of the provincial party committee, and Wang Xinmin, secretary 
general of the provincial party committee, participated in the 
visiting activities. 
  At the institute of a certain army unit stationed in Harbin, 
Yue Qifeng carefully listened to briefings and asked in detail 
about the training and living of officers and men. Yue Qifeng 
said: Economic development can never be separated from the army, 
and a modernized army must also rely on economic development. 
He called on the institute to train more qualified personnel 
and to exert efforts to and offer plans for strengthening the 
national defense force and developing the local economy. 
  At a certain combined arms army stationed in Harbin, Yue 
Qifeng highly affirmed the contributions to local development 
and stability of the new generation of officers and men 
defending the border areas and expressed hope that the local 
people and the army will jointly emancipate the mind, help each 
other, and invigorate Heilongjiang. 
  Yue Qifeng said to the leading comrades of the provincial 
military district: It is necessary to organize the militia to 
actively develop the processing, aquaculture, and [words 
indistinct] industries. On hearing that militia have 
contributed to township enterprises, he expressed appreciation 
and pointed out: All cadres and soldiers should be organized to 
study professional knowledge. We have a good prospect for 
training dual-purpose personnel and making them play a part in 
the main economic battlefield. 
  Yue Qifeng, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
emphatically pointed out: The key to accelerating economic 
development is to emancipate the mind and change concepts. Once 
the concepts are changed, tremendous potentials will be seen. 
Those who rapidly change their concepts will gain the 
initiative. Heilongjiang is quite strong in natural resources, 
trained personnel, science and technology, and the quality of 
the masses. As long as it breaks away from the planned economy 
on its own initiative and rapidly enters the market economy, it 
will achieve great development.

  [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs Friday [27 May] declined comment on the US decision to 
renew most-favored-nation (MFN) trade privileges to Mainland 
China. 
  "It is our established policy not to get involved in 
Washington-Beijing relations," the ministry said in a news 
release. "We, therefore, will not comment on the MFN issue." 
  Nevertheless, the ministry said it hopes the United States 
will not reduce its concern about human rights conditions on the 
mainland even though president Bill Clinton has decided to sever 
the link between trade and human rights. 
  The ministry further said it believes Mainland China's 
sustained economic development and growing trade with the 
outside world will help boost social and political reforms in 
the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Meanwhile, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said the US 
renewal of MFN trade privileges to the mainland will not affect 
Taiwan's exports to the American market. 
  Tsai Lien-sheng, a BOFT department director, said computers 
and electronic products are Taiwan's main exports to the US, 
while labor-intensive goods, such as toys, footwear and 
textiles, form the bulk of mainland exports to that market. 
  "With different product structures, Taiwan has nothing to 
lose in the US decision to renew Mainland China's MFN status," 
Tsai noted. 
  He added Taiwan manufacturers should continue developing 
high 
value-added products and upgrading production technology in 
order to maintain their niches in the US market. 
  The Chinese National Federation of Industries, one of the 
largest trade associations here, said it welcomes the US renewal 
of MFN privileges for the mainland. 
  "Taiwan-owned companies on the mainland will benefit from 
such a decision," the federation said. The US remains the most 
important market for products produced by mainland-based Taiwan 
firms, including toys, garments, bicycles and consumer 
electronics. 
  Clinton announced Thursday he will renew Mainland China's 
MFN 
trade status even though Beijing still commits serious human 
rights abuses. MFN is accorded the vast majority of US trading 
partners and allows them to sell goods in the US at the lowest 
possible tariff rate.

  [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Foreign Minister Fredrick 
C. Chien said Thursday [26 May] that Taiwan is sincere in 
negotiating with the United States in trying to settle a debt it 
has owed since World War II. 
  "However, we will not pay the debt without prudent 
consideration," Chien said while responding to a legislative 
query by Democratic Progressive Party legislator Yu Ling-ya. 
  Chien said the United States granted about US$1 billion in 
loans to the Republic of China [ROC] during the war, but that 
the ROC Government made huge expenditures for US troops 
stationed in Mainland China. Therefore, he said, to simply say 
the ROC owes the US the money would be unreasonable. 
  Taipei and Washington have since 1960 held several rounds of 
talks on the debt issue, but because of the difficulty in 
finding documents related to the debt, no conclusions have 
resulted. 
  Chien, however, said that Taiwan is still willing to discuss 
the issue with the United States in an effort to find a 
solution. "As long as the US wants us to talk, then we will 
talk," Chien said. 
  Several lawmakers have urged the government to reject US 
requests to pay the debt because the United States no longer 
recognizes the Republic of China. Instead, they say, the United 
States should turn to Mainland China to claim the debt.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (CNS) -- The President of the State 
Mr. Jiang Zemin when attending a ceremony in which appointment 
letters were conferred on the third batch of advisors on Hong 
Kong affairs said that he hoped to see greater involvement of 
Hong Kong people in the territory's affairs. He added that 
being an advisor or a member of the Preliminary Working 
Committee was considered a good pattern in participation in Hong 
Kong affairs. 
  Mr. Jiang said that there were various kinds of 
participation 
in Hong Kong affairs. He called for Hong Kong people to have 
greater concern for restoration of sovereignty of the territory 
to China in 1997 as well as for long term prosperity and 
stability which was closely related to the destiny of Hong Kong 
people. 
  The President said that there were a mere three years left 
for the reversion of Hong Kong to China and so much work was yet 
to be done. The "one country, two systems" and "rule of Hong 
Kong by its people" would be the very policy to be adopted by 
the future Special Administrative Region government. Mr Jiang 
said that the central government as well as Hong Kong people 
were confident of such policies. 
  Mr. Jiang said that economic prosperity enjoyed by Hong Kong 
people was mainly due to hard working by the territory's people. 
He was convinced that Hong Kong people were not only capable of 
creating a prosperous and stable Hong Kong but also capable of 
maintaining such success. He went further saying that Hong Kong 
people could even create a better future for the territory. 
  The president stressed that stability and prosperity in Hong 
Kong was closely related to economic development in the mainland 
which lent great support to so many economic activities 
undertaken in Hong Kong. He added that the socialist mainland 
would still support the territory for its stability and 
prosperity after 1997.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin said here today that "we are fully confident that Hong 
Kong people can administer Hong Kong well." 
  He made the remark while meeting 49 newly-invited advisors 
on 
Hong Kong affairs and 13 newly-appointed members of the 
Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
  The 49 new advisors on Hong Kong affairs received their 
letters of appointment here today, bringing the total number of 
advisors on Hong Kong affairs to 141. The practice to invite 
advisors on Hong Kong affairs began in 1992. 
  Many urgent tasks remain to be done at a faster pace since 
in 
three years China will resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong, he 
said. China has already formulated a series of important 
policies on the administration of Hong Kong after 1997. 
  He said that Deng Xiaoping pointed out a decade ago that 
Chinese people in Hong Kong have the ability to administer Hong 
Kong well and that it is an idea left over by the old 
colonialism not believe this. 
  Jiang said that Hong Kong's economic stability and 
prosperity 
of today are inseparable from the Hong Kong people's diligence 
and creativeness. Hong Kong people will surely be able to 
create a bright future for Hong Kong, he said. 
  Of course, he added, neither can Hong Kong's economic 
stability and prosperity be separated from the mainland's 
economic development. 
  The president said that an important purpose of setting up 
the preliminary committee and inviting Hong Kong affairs 
advisors is to provide a chance and channel for Hong Kong people 
to participate in the cause for a smooth transition in Hong Kong 
and lay a foundation for the realization of "Hong Kong people 
ruling Hong Kong" after 1997. 
  He expressed the hope that all the Hong Kong people would 
care for the affairs related to China's resumption of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong and for Hong Kong's long-term 
prosperity and stability, which he said are closely connected 
with the interests of the Hong Kong people. 
  He also expressed the hope that the advisors and members of 
the preliminary committee will increase their contacts with the 
mainland and facilitate the Hong Kong people's participation in 
the cause so as to make full preparations for the coming of the 
year 1997. 
  Other senior Chinese leaders attending today's meeting 
include Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Zhu Rongji, Li Lanqing, Zou Jiahua, 
Qian Qichen, Luo Gan, Ji Pengfei and Lu Ping. 
  In a separate group discussion today, the new advisors and 
members of the preliminary committee put forth many constructive 
opinions and suggestions concerning Hong Kong's financial 
policy, inflation, price of accommodation, continued employment 
of civil servants, education on the youth and others issues. 
  Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
under the State Council, said that practice has proved it 
successful to invite advisors on Hong Kong affairs. 
  He spoke highly of the advisors' work. They have offered a 
large amount of valuable suggestions on important issues 
concerning the smooth transition in 1997 as well as issues 
related to the transitional period, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- State leaders including 
Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Zhu Rongji received the 
third batch of advisers on Hong Kong affairs and the newly 
appointed members of the Preliminary Working Committee for the 
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. 
  President Jiang Zemin gave an important speech. After warmly 
congratulating them, he said: Time flies fast. Many urgent 
tasks remain to be done at a faster pace because in three years 
China will resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong. 
  He pointed out: The CPC Central Committee has already 
formulated a series of important principles and policies on the 
administration of Hong Kong after 1997. Deng Xiaoping pointed 
out sincerely as early as a decade ago that Chinese people in 
Hong Kong have the ability to administer Hong Kong well and that 
not believing this is the case is an idea left over by the old 
colonialism. We have full confidence that people in Hong Kong 
will administer Hong Kong well. He said that Hong Kong's 
economic stability and prosperity today are inseparable from the 
Hong Kong people's diligence and creativity. This was true in 
the past and remains so today. The people of Hong Kong will 
surely be able to create a bright future for Hong Kong. Of 
course, Hong Kong's economic stability and prosperity can not be 
separated from the mainland's economic development either. 
  Jiang Zemin said in conclusion: One important purpose of 
setting up the preliminary committee and inviting Hong Kong 
affairs advisers is to provide a chance and channel for Hong 
Kong people to participate in the cause for a smooth transition 
in Hong Kong and to lay a foundation for the realization of 
"Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" after 1997. He expressed 
the hope that all the Hong Kong people will care for the affairs 
related to China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and 
for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, because 
these are closely connected with the interests of the Hong Kong 
people. He also expressed the hope that the advisers and

contacts with the mainland and facilitate the Hong Kong people's 
participation in the cause so as to make full preparations for

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress 
(NPC), today issued appointment certificates to 13 new members 
of the country's working panel for Hong Kong transition in 1997. 
  The move was meant to increase the working capacity of the 
Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said Qiao. 
  "The preliminary committee has been shouldering more and 
more 
tasks with the date for China's resumption of sovereignty over 
Hong Kong drawing near," Qiao said. 
  The 13 new members were chosen by the NPC Standing Committee 
on May 12, with eight from Hong Kong, five from the mainland. 
  Qiao expected the new members, together with other members, 
to work in an active and steadfast way for the establishment of 
the preparatory committee, under the guidance of the "one 
country, two systems" policy, and by adhering to the basic law 
and relevant NPC decisions. 
  He said the work by the preliminary committee will directly 
involve the smooth transition in Hong Kong in 1997. 
  Qiao urged them to continue to solicit the opinions of Hong 
Kong people, pay more attention to survey and research, and 
enable Hong Kong people to care for and participate in preparing 
for China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. 
  Qiao said that since its establishment in July 1993, the 
preliminary committee has been well received by the public 
through its hard and practical work, for which he expressed 
"heart-felt" thanks to its director Qian Qichen and other staff 
members. 
  The preliminary committee comprises 70 members, of which 32 
are from the mainland and 38 from Hong Kong. The members are 
mostly leading officials of relevant departments, jurists, 
economists, and representatives from all walks of life in Hong 
Kong.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- A ceremony to present 
certificates of appointment to additional members of the 
Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [HKSAR] Preparatory Committee under the 
National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee was held at 
the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. 
  NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi presented the 
certificates to the 13 new PWC members. Vice Chairman Tian 
Jiyun presided over the ceremony. 
  Chairman Qiao Shi made an important speech. He said: Since 
its establishment in July last year, the PWC has worked very 
hard and pragmatically. It has attracted extensive attention 
and won favorable comments from various quarters. On behalf of 
the NPC Standing Committee, I extend my heartfelt thanks to 
Chairman Qian Qichen and the committee's vice chairmen, members, 
and working personnel. 
  Qiao Shi said: The PWC's work burden will become 
increasingly heavier as the day when China assumes the exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong draws near. The purpose of 
selecting additional PWC members is to strengthen its working 
power. We believe that the additional members will certainly 
live up to the people's aspirations and join other committee 
members and take the initiative in doing solid preparatory work 
for the establishment of the HKSAR Preparatory Committee under 
the guidance of the general principle of "one country, two 
systems," the Basic Law, and the relevant NPC decisions. 
  Qiao Shi emphasized: The PWC's work has a direct bearing on 
the transfer of government and the smooth transition of Hong 
Kong in 1997. I hope that the PWC will continue to widely 
listen to the Hong Kong people's opinions; pay attention to 
investigation and study; and by various means and ways, make the 
Hong Kong people show a common concern about and participate in 
the preparatory work for China to resume its sovereignty over 
Hong Kong. So long as the vast number of Hong Kong people 
participate in our work and the people across the country 
strongly support our work, we certainly can triumphantly 
accomplish the glorious mission assigned us by history. 
  Present at today's ceremony were Wang Hanbin, Ni Zhifu, Sun 
Qimeng, Chen Muhua, Qin Jiwei, Lu Jiaxi, and Buhe, vice chairmen 
of the NPC Standing Committee; Cao Zhi, secretary general of the 
NPC Standing Committee; and Qian Qichen, vice premier of the 
State Council and chairman of the PWC.

  [Text] Waves of laughter drifted from the 
chandelier-lighted Bafangyuan building of the Diaoyutai State 
Guesthouse in Beijing tonight when Vice Premier Qian Qichen 
threw a party to entertain the third batch of advisers on Hong 
Kong affairs and newly appointed members of the Preliminary 
Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region [SAR]. 
  At the party, Qian Qichen proposed a toast wishing a smooth 
transition for Hong Kong will have a smooth transition and 
long-term prosperity and stability in the future, which was 
warmly echoed by the guests. 
  Qian Qichen said that he was very pleased to see so many new 
and old friends joining the ranks and files of advisers on Hong 
Kong affairs and members of the Preliminary Working Committee 
for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong SAR. He said: 
Only three years remain until Hong Kong makes its transition. 
Generally speaking, the current situation in Hong Kong is 
fairly good. This can mainly be attributed to the reform and 
opening as well as to the sustained and stable economic 
development on the mainland which enables Hong Kong to maintain 
a strong momentum for its economic growth. What is especially 
encouraging is the fact that as 1 July 1997 is approaching, more 
and more Hong Kong residents are conscientiously joining the 
contingent of people who want to maintain Hong Kong's stability 
and prosperity and promote a smooth transition by Hong Kong. 
With a great sense of responsibility and enthusiasm, they pay 
attention to and participate in affairs relating to the 
organization of the Hong Kong SAR and the realization of a 
smooth transition in Hong Kong. This is a sense of 
responsibility and participation becoming to the masters of Hong 
Kong. This is also a prelude to the successful realization of 
the goal that "Hong Kong be governed by Hong Kong residents." 
  While talking about the cooperation between China and 
Britain, Qian Qichen said: Although the Sino-British 
negotiations on the Hong Kong elections in 1994 and 1995 broke 
down, we still hope to maintain cooperation with the British 
side in other respects. However, cooperation is bilateral. We 
can not mainly entrust our hopes for a smooth transition of Hong 
Kong and its long-term stability and prosperity on cooperation 
by Britain. More importantly, it is necessary to 
conscientiously carry out a series of correct principles and 
policies of the Chinese Government toward Hong Kong, whose 
future is guaranteed by the Basic Law. We should depend on the 
active participation of the broad masses of Hong Kong residents 
and the support of people across the country. As long as we 
base our tasks on a foundation like this one, we will be 
completely able to resume our sovereignty over Hong Kong on 
schedule and to achieve the goal of a stable transition in Hong 
Kong. 
  Attending the banquet were Luo Gan, Ji Pengfei, Lu Ping, 
Zhou 
Nan, and other leading cadres.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- A ceremony to present 
letters of appointment to the third batch of advisers on Hong 
Kong affairs was held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing 
this afternoon. State leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, 
Qiao Shi, and Zhu Rongji, attended the ceremony. 
  Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, said in his speech: We have successively 
appointed two batches of advisers on Hong Kong affairs since 
1992. The past two years' experience has shown that the 
practice of appointing advisers on Hong Kong affairs has been 
successful. Shouldering a profound sense of responsibility 
toward the Hong Kong people and their future; utilizing their 
own talents, experiences, and advantages in their familiarity 
with various aspects of Hong Kong society; and applying various 
formats and channels, the advisers have made many valuable 
suggestions on some major issues concerning the final 
transitional period and on matters regarding the transfer of 
government in 1997 and a smooth transition of Hong Kong. They 
have played a very effective role as a think tank in the work of 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY Hong Kong branch, and even in affecting the central 
people's government's decisions on Hong Kong affairs. 
Meanwhile, Hong Kong affairs advisers have, by exerting their 
personal influence, played an active role in publicizing the 
Chinese Government's general and specific policies toward Hong 
Kong; have publicized the basic law; and have reassured people's 
feelings in general. Consequently, they have become an 
important link and network that facilitate connections and 
communications between us and the broad masses of Hong Kong 
people. 
  Lu Ping said: The total number of the three batches of Hong 
Kong affairs advisers has reached 141. The contingent has 
expanded and has more extensive representativeness among its 
members. Pursuing the principle that Hong Kong affairs advisers 
have been appointed as individuals, we will listen to their 
proposals, and various different suggestions and criticisms; 
will make concerted efforts in unison; will properly perform the 
tasks together so as to realize our common objectives -- a 
smooth transition of Hong Kong and its long-term stability and 
prosperity. 
  As 1 July 1997 draws near, not only the broad masses of Hong 
Kong people have not weakened their confidence in Hong Kong's 
future due to the Sino-British disputes over political system 
issues, but they have strengthened it. More and more Hong Kong 
people have demonstrated a profound sense of responsibility and 
involvement for a smooth transition of Hong Kong. Many friends 
have formed this conviction: Now that the Sino-British talks on 
political system issues have broken down, we must rely on our 
own strength [li liang 0500 6852] to ensure a smooth transition 
of Hong Kong. Such conviction has further enhanced our 
confidence in Hong Kong's future. 
  Lu Ping stressed: Comrade Deng Xiaoping had said as early as 
a decade ago that "Hong Kong people will administer Hong Kong." 
In other words, "Hong Kong people consisting mainly of patriots 
will administer Hong Kong." He also pointed out that we should 
create conditions for Hong Kong people to smoothly take over the 
government during the transitional period. He urged "Hong Kong 
people of various circles to make efforts in this regard." We 
hope that upholding the stance on saying all they know without 
reserve as masters of their own affairs, Hong Kong affairs 
advisers will make valuable proposals on a smooth transition of 
Hong Kong, on a successful transfer of government [zheng quan 
shun li jiao jie 2398 2938 7311 0448 0074 2234] in 1997, and on 
maintaining long-term stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. 
  Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong 
branch, presented the letters of appointment to the 49 new Hong 
Kong affairs advisers. 
  Also attending the meeting were leading comrades Zou Jiahua, 
Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Luo Gan, and Ji Pengfei.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 May (XINHUA) -- This morning, Lu Ping, 
director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, and Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong 
Kong branch, held an informal discussion with the third batch of 
Hong Kong affairs advisers and newly appointed members of the 
Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] for the Preparatory 
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [HKSAR] 
to hear their views on Hong Kong affairs. 
  Participating in today's informal group discussions were 49 
Hong Kong affairs advisers and 13 new PWC members. The 
participants expressed their individual views and put forward 
many constructive ideas and suggestions on Hong Kong's monetary 
policy, inflation, housing prices, public servants' continued 
employment after 1997, and youngsters' education; on how Hong 
Kong's major capital construction could be coordinated and 
brought into line with that of the mainland; and on other issues 
touching upon a wide variety of fields such as politics, 
economics, culture, education, law, and social order. 
  Lu Ping and Zhou Nan spoke separately at the informal 
discussion. Lu Ping said: Although Sino-British talks on Hong 
Kong's 1994 and 1995 elections broke down due to the lack of 
sincerity by the British side, the Chinese Government still 
hopes to continue maintaining cooperation with Britain in other 
fields. However, whether or not the two sides can cooperate 
will mainly hinge on Britain's attitude. He said: On the one 
hand, we hope for cooperation with Britain; on the other, we 
should not cherish too many illusions concerning Britain. We 
should build our work on our own foundation, truly realize 
participation by the Hong Kong people, and properly carry out 
various preparatory work during the final transitional period to 
bring about a smooth transition in 1997. We are now three years 
away from 1 July 1997, and we still need to carry out a much 
work of various types. I hope that all PWC members and Hong 
Kong affairs advisers will actively throw themselves into 
preparatory work for the HKSAR. He said: Hong Kong has many 
qualified personnel in various fields; we believe that Hong Kong 
certainly will be able to enjoy continued prosperity and 
stability under the future HKSAR government staffed by patriotic 
Hong Kong people. 
  Zhou Nan said: All of you have put forward so many 
constructive ideas; this reflects the great sense of 
responsibility among Hong Kong affairs advisers and PWC members. 
Zhou Nan said: It is extremely important for the Hong Kong 
people to take part in local affairs during the transitional 
period. I hope that Hong Kong affairs advisers and PWC members 
will always put forward ideas and suggestions to make 
contributions to Hong Kong's smooth transition and long-term 
prosperity and stability. 
  Chen Ziying and Wang Fengchao, State Council Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office deputy directors; as well as Qin Wenjun, 
XINHUA Hong Kong branch deputy director, also participated in 
this morning's informal discussion.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 26 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
official said here today that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's 
proposal to set up a human rights commission in the territory 
not only violates the Basic Law but also poses a threat to the 
smooth transition of Hong Kong. 
  Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong 
branch, made the remarks here on a public occasion on Wednesday 
[25 May] while commenting on the proposal recently put forward 
by Chris Patten for establishing a human rights commission in 
the territory. 
  The human rights of the Hong Kong people are fully 
guaranteed 
in the Basic Law, Zhu said, noting that the proposal runs 
counter to the Basic Law, and therefore, is not conducive to the 
smooth transition of Hong Kong. 
  He also criticized Patten for paying only lip service to the 
Sino-British cooperation on the one hand, and constantly setting 
up new barriers on the other hand. 
  Zhu warned that such a human rights commission would be 
dismantled in 1997 if it were indeed set up.

  [Text] Yesterday (25 May), Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of 
XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, said that the Basic Law provides 
sufficient guarantees for the human rights of Hong Kong 
residents, so the establishment of a human rights commission in 
Hong Kong is, first of all, a violation of the Basic Law, and is 
also a major hindrance to Hong Kong's smooth transition. This 
is unacceptable to the Chinese side, and the operation of a 
human rights commission will certainly be terminated after 1997. 
  Zhu Yucheng said this yesterday afternoon when questioned by 
reporters while he was attending the news conference on the sale 
of Beijing's Fenglian Square. 
  When answering reporters' questions about a human rights 
commission, Zhu said: "As far as Hong Kong residents' human 
rights are concerned, their duties and rights are all fully 
guaranteed by the Basic Law. Therefore, we hold that the 
establishment of a human rights commission in Hong Kong is, 
first of all, a violation of the Basic Law; and that will also 
create many hindrances to a smooth transition. That is 
unfavorable to Hong Kong's smooth transition." 
  He added that although Hong Kong Governor Patten repeatedly 
talks about the necessity of cooperation between Britain and 
China, the issue of a human rights commission shows that he is 
in fact setting up new obstacles to Sino-British cooperation. 
This is unacceptable to the Chinese side. 
  Zhu Yucheng pointed out that if the British Hong Kong 
authorities really set up a human rights commission in Hong 
Kong, the Chinese side will never recognize it, and the human 
rights commission will certainly be unable to continue operation 
after 1997. In addition, when asked about whether Hong Kong 
civil servants of foreign origin may achieve Chinese 
citizenship, Zhu Yucheng said that the Preliminary Working 
Committee is now considering this issue, and it is believed that 
a solution acceptable to all parties concerned will be worked 
out. 
  When attending another public occasion earlier yesterday, 
Zhu 
Yucheng was asked about the issue of the new airport. He said 
that the Chinese side has never changed its attitude, and always 
hopes that an agreement between the Chinese side and the British 
side may be reached at an earlier date. 
  He pointed out that as Director Lu Ping of the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office had said, the 
problem that the Chinese side and the British side are now 
trying to solve remains the financial arrangements for the new 
airport project.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing 
today restated the Chinese Government's "goal on the Hong Kong 
issue" as to resume the exercise of sovereignty on one hand, and 
to practice "one-country, two systems," letting the Hong Kong 
people rule Hong Kong, on the other, so as to ensure further 
prosperity and stability there. 
  He made the statement here today while meeting with a 
delegation from the Textile Council of Hong Kong headed by its 
Chairman Kenneth Fang. 
  "To maintain Hong Kong prosperous and stable is not only the 
hope of the Hong Kong compatriots, but also the need of the 
whole nation," Li said, calling Hong Kong "a bridge between the 
mainland and the outside world." 
  Li noted that Hong Kong's public servants, who have rich 
administrative experience, had played an important role in 
achieving Hong Kong's prosperity. 
  "We understand their predicament at present, and hope that 
they would continue to work with ease of mind," he said. "We 
also hope that they would make continued contribution to the 
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong after 1997."

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Hong Wen (1738 2429): "The British Hong Kong </F>
Authorities Have No Right To Extend the Terms of Office of 
Legislative Council Members Beyond 1997"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 9 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Although 
the Chinese side recently had reiterated time and again that the 
three-tier councils of Hong Kong would definitely have to be 
dismissed and reelected in 1997, Hong Kong Government officials 
insisted at a Legislative Council [Legco] meeting today that the 
term of office for would-be council members would still be four 
years, and thus could straddle 1997. Some Legco members have 
therefore questioned this statement by the Hong Kong Government, 
which could mislead candidates and discourage them from viewing 
the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 as a fundamental change. 
  The return of Hong Kong to China in 1997 will be a change 
which involves a transfer of sovereignty, which is substantially 
different from events such as a certain party's stepping down 
while another rises to power in the UK. Therefore, generally, a 
new legislative body will have to be formed in 1997. 
  However, there are indications that even now the Hong Kong 
Government has no intention of changing its stand on the issue 
concerning the term of office for Legco members. Instead, it is 
insisting on the four-year term of office for members of the 
three-tier councils, as provided in Chris Patten's 
constitutional reform package. Legco member Chim Pui-chung 
maintains that the above provision is obviously based on wishful 
thinking and may mislead the candidates. 
  According to the set election schedule, by 30 June 1997, 
newly elected district board members will have been in office 
for not more than 32 months, while Legco members will have been 
in office for only 22 months. For both categories, the terms of 
office will be less than 4 years. Therefore, some public 
figures have pointed out that now that the Sino-British talks on 
the constitutional system have broken off, the Chinese side will 
definitely perform its duty to "set up another kitchen" 
according to the Basic Law by 1997. The British Hong Kong 
authorities have no right to unilaterally set a four-year term 
of office for Legco members, because, if they do, they could be 
accused of disregarding China's sovereignty. 
  Chim Pui-chung noted that the British Hong Kong authorities 
are juggling with words in order to extend their influence 
beyond 1997. This reflects the lack of frankness and sincerity 
on the part of the British Hong Kong authorities toward the Hong 
Kong people, a mentality which is absolutely harmful to their 
administration in Hong Kong before 1997. Chim urged the Hong 
Kong Government to face the reality squarely and give the 
electorate a reasonable and clear explanation on the term of 
office for council members.

<F P=106> [By Rain Ren and Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] China last night unleashed a stinging attack on the 
British and Hong Kong governments for allowing Han Dongfang, the 
exiled dissident, to return to the territory where he is helping 
to organise the mainland's budding free labour movemement. A 
Hong Kong-based Chinese official said the Government supported 
"subversive actions" against China. 
  The official also condemned the scheduled visit next month 
of 
Wu'er Kaixi, a leading Tiananmen Square student activist. "Of 
course the Government knows perfectly well what kind of persons 
Han and Wu'er Kaixi are. Just look at what they've done," he 
said. "Wu'er Kaixi came to Hong Kong secretly last year. He is 
coming again this year. Han will stay here as long as the visa 
allows him to stay. So it is fair to say the Hong Kong 
government deliberately connives with their subversive actions 
against the Chinese government. It will be very interesting to 
know how Britain would react if we deployed thousands of IRA in 
Shenzhen or near the border of Britain." 
  The official said the Government had ignored China's request 
to stop Wu'er and Han from coming to Hong Kong. "The Hong Kong 
government has allowed Han to stay in Hong Kong even though Han 
does not possess a Chinese passport. It has also granted him a 
work visa," he said. "The Government has done all this, which 
is a departure from all conventions. Does it want to turn Hong 
Kong into a pioneering battleground for subverting China? We 
should wait and see. We have, through normal channels, informed 
the Hong Kong government about our thoughts, but it does not 
want to co-operate with us. There is nothing we can do.... We 
don't think we should protest to the Government. Han is not 
worth a word of protest. A few years ago, Deng Xiaoping said if 
the US wanted this kind of person [mainland dissidents] it could 
take them, and we could give the US thousands of them. The US 
government has always been providing asylum to these so-called 
democracy advocates who try to overthrow the Chinese government 
and the Chinese Communist Party. Now Britain follows suit." 
  Han, who announced on Tuesday that he has temporarily 
abandoned his efforts to return to China and is concentrating on 
the mainland's free labour movement from Hong Kong, remained 
defiant last night. "China's strong reaction will not cause me 
to change my plans to remain in Hong Kong. Their reaction to my 
staying here was even worse last year," he said. "Now they 
suddenly realise that they have no way to control me here and 
they are very angry. At least up until 1997 they will not be 
able to control me unless they come to Hong Kong to arrest me. 
From last year they realised that forcing me to stay here was a 
bad thing. But they are unwilling to recognise their error. 
Now that I have changed my original plan, and realise I can do 
in Hong Kong what I once did in Beijing, they have become even 
more outraged ... it has become a big headache for them. They 
have no right to criticise the British or the Hong Kong 
governments because they (the Chinese) forced me here in the 
first place." 
  Han, 30, the founder and leader of the Beijing Workers 
Autonomous Federation, was jailed for 22 months for his part in 
the Tiananmen Square uprising in 1989. He was freed to obtain 
medical treatment for tuberculosis in the US in September 1992. 
He said last night that China will attempt to make life 
difficult for him. "Maybe, as 1997 draws near, they will put 
more and more pressure on the Hong Kong government or on those 
who can influence the decision-makers in the Hong Kong 
government," he said. "But if I strictly abide by my legal 
status here, at least until 1997, there should be no problems. 
They may alternatively decide to use some methods to penetrate 
my activities here in order to clearly understand what I do." 
  Han is setting up a network of correspondents in China, to 
whom he will provide information about agitating for workers' 
rights. He was stopped from returning to China in August 1993. 
Chinese officials later declared his passport "cancelled", 
rendering him stateless. The Hong Kong government granted him a 
three-month work permit in March and another this week, after 
Han returned from visiting his wife in the US. 
  The Governor's spokesmen were unavailable for comment last 
night.

  [Text] The Government is likely to grant a tourist visa to 
Wu'er Kaixi, a leading Tiananmen Square student activist, if he 
promises to maintain a low profile and does not declare his 
intention to take part in open political activities during his 
planned July visit. 
  Despite intense Chinese criticism, the Government also 
intends to continue giving sanctuary to Han Dongfang, one of 
China's best-known labour activists. A senior government 
official said last night that Wu'er's application for a visa 
would be considered on its merits, adding that the decision 
would also have to take into account public interest. However, 
it is understood that Wu'er has not yet applied for a visa. 
  Last week, Wu'er said he intended to visit Hong Kong "to see 
friends" in late June and July. A Chinese official reacted to 
this angrily on Wednesday, and accused the Government of 
intending to turn Hong Kong into a "subversive base" by 
sheltering Han, who has returned to Hong Kong from the United 
States. 
  China's condemnation was rejected yesterday by the 
Government. A spokesman said Han's case had nothing to do with 
allowing him to use Hong Kong as a "subversive base". "We 
simply gave him a visa to stay here so that he can continue to 
press his case with the Chinese authorities to return to China." 
  The deputy to the Governor, Anson Chan, said yesterday that 
it was for the Government to maintain and safeguard the basic 
freedoms of the Hong Kong people. "These basic freedoms include 
the freedom to express one's views freely in a peaceful and 
lawful manner. 
  "The question of offering hospitality for visitors to Hong 
Kong who might use Hong Kong as a base for subversion is quite a 
different matter. Neither the Hong Kong government nor the Hong 
Kong people wish to see Hong Kong being used as a base for 
subversion and we intend fully to abide by the concept of "one 
country, two systems" and, of course, this is a two-way street." 
  It is understood that Chan's remarks were in response to 
rumours that some Chinese democratic movement activists were 
heading for Hong Kong to attend or organise public gatherings to 
commemorate the fifth anniversary of the June 4 massacre.

<F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing and Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] China's jailing of MING PAO reporter Xi Yang came 
under attack yesterday from two Hong Kong affairs advisers. 
  Speaking at a ceremony in Beijing in which she and 48 other 
advisers were formally named, Chung Kei-wing pleaded for 
leniency towards Xi, who was jailed for 12 years for "stealing 
state secrets". 
  Miss Chung, vice-chancellor of Shue Yan College, urged 
Chinese officials to grant parole of between three and seven 
years to Xi if he behaved well in prison. To do so, it would 
not be necessary for China to change its verdict on Xi, Miss 
Chung told officials. 
  Another adviser, Shum Choi-sang, said he told officials the 
12-year sentence was too heavy. Mr Shum said Xi had merely done 
his duty by Hong Kong people. "Whether it is right or wrong for 
him to do that is another issue," said Mr Shum, adviser to the 
Newspaper Society of Hong Kong. 
  Beijing was also criticised by another affairs adviser, 
Tsang 
Shu-ki, who said he was unhappy with the way China had dealt 
with the removal as an adviser of Meeting Point chairman Anthony 
Cheung Bing-leung. While China said it had withdrawn Mr 
Cheung's invitation because he had insisted on being appointed 
as a representative of the Democratic Party rather than in his 
personal capacity, pro-China newspapers had given other reasons, 
Mr Tsang said. 
  "Although I can't say the left-wing newspapers represent 
China, it really gives the impression, there were political 
reasons behind Mr Cheung's sacking," he said. But another 
adviser, Chan Man-hung, who is a Meeting Point member, said Mr 
Cheung deserved his treatment. 
  "It is the price he should pay". "He wanted to be an adviser 
and he tried to cover up the merger" of Meeting Point and the 
United Democrats to form the Democratic Party, he said. In an 
open letter to Chinese leaders yesterday, Mr Cheung said Chinese 
policy towards Hong Kong had been wrong. He cited China's 
refusal to introduce direct elections in 1988 and said the Basic 
Law showed it had failed to incorporate the principle of "Hong 
Kong people ruling Hong Kong people". 
  Mr Cheung also lashed out at the mainland authorities for 
isolating the democratic forces in Hong Kong while trying to 
obtain support from the business sector. "By distancing itself 
from the democratic forces after the June 4 crackdown and 
isolating certain democratic figures, (China) has further 
separated itself from Hong Kong society," he said. 
  He urged that transitional matters be discussed through the 
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, whose openness should be 
increased. 
  The franchise for the functional constituency elections 
should be expanded and the method of voting ought to be simple 
and fair.

<F P=106> [By Victor Smart in London] </F>
  [Text] The Governor, Chris Patten, has declared that the 
row between China and Britain over Hong Kong is subsiding 
despite the political stalemate over his democratic reforms. 
  "I believe that we are now through the worst of the 
political 
argument that we have had, alas, with China," the Governor told 
an invited audience at the conservative Carlton Club in London 
on Wednesday night. "I hope that we can find ways of 
co-operating elsewhere." 
  Patten's remarks reflect the Hong Kong government's belief 
that Beijing has now "ring-fenced" the deadlocked issue of 
democratic reforms, and is willing to work jointly on projects 
such as the building of the new airport. 
  Patten drew strong parallels between the legacy of democracy 
Britain left behind in post-colonial India and his hopes riding 
on the future of Hong Kong. Asserting that Britain had taught 
India the "literature of liberty", Patten declared that by the 
time he left in 1997, he hoped to have "put the stamp of the 
continuance of an open, plural society" on the territory. 
  Yesterday, Patten reinforced his message about the 
overwhelming importance of the steps towards democratic 
accountability at a meeting in Manchester. 
  He said: "If the Joint Declaration is implemented in full, I 
believe that Hong Kong will have a spectacular future." 
  The territory would be assured, he argued, of the role in 
relation to the Chinese economy that New York played in the 
opening up of the American continent. 
  "If the Joint Declaration is not implemented in full, Hong 
Kong will put in jeopardy the characteristics which make it 
special -- the rule of law, a free press, a high level of 
resistance to corruption," he said. "Hong Kong will no longer be 
special and the potential offered by the historic `one country 
two systems' concept will have been squandered."

<F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing and Chris Yeung] </F>
  [Text] Attempts by the Liberal Party and some independent 
legislators to craft a compromise version of the package of 
political changes proposed by Governor Chris Patten have fallen 
on deaf ears in Beijing. The coalition had hoped to win 
acceptance of amendments that would bring the proposals closer 
to the post-1997 political structure envisaged in China's 
interpretation of the Basic Law. But a senior mainland official 
declined to give his blessing to adjustments that might reverse 
Beijing's present stance that the territory's political 
structure will terminate on July 1, 1997 and be replaced with 
one worked out between now and then. 
  Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
Chen Ziying, instead told a delegation of Hong Kong textile 
merchants in Beijing that "the British side can do whatever it 
likes to before 1997". Mr Patten's proposals come before the 
Legislative Council next month. 
  Despite repeated attempts to broach the possibility that 
China might accept the coalition's compromise version of Mr 
Patten's proposals, Mr Chen would make no comment. Under the 
Liberal Party's model announced last week, the total size of 
franchise for functional constituency elections would be reduced 
to no more than 170,000. Mr Patten seeks to widen the franchise 
to about 2.5 million. 
  Henry Tang Ying-yen, who ranks highly in the Liberal Party, 
said the delegation was told that the 1995 Legislative Council 
had a lifespan of 20 months and would be disbanded by June 30, 
1997. Mr Tang said a compromise was desirable to avoid a 
"one-party-dominated" legislature in 1995, apparently referring 
to the likelihood that a Legco controlled by "small `l' 
liberals" could not survive the changeover because China would 
not accept the "through-train" arrangement. "Mr Chen has not 
said whether he would support our amendments or not," Mr Tang 
said. 
  Leader of the delegation, Fong Hang, believed it was very 
difficult for China to commit itself on any Hong Kong affairs 
before 1997. 
  Mr Tang quoted Mr Chen as stressing that the nine new 
functional constituency seats should not be turned into some 
form of direct elections in disguise. Mr Chen said workers 
should not be eligible to vote in the nine new functional 
constituency seats because there were already two seats for the 
labour sector. Mr Tang said Mr Chen agreed with coalition 
proposals that the existing corporate voting system should be 
adopted for the nine extra seats. 
  The Liberal Party and some independents held the view that 
their model would have a better chance to get through the 
Legislative Council if they could secure support from their 
pro-China colleagues. A blessing from Chinese officials such as 
Mr Chen was regarded as vital in winning support from the 
pro-China side. 
  Legislator Tam Yiu-chung of the Democratic Alliance for the 
Betterment of Hong Kong said his group "appreciated" the efforts 
of the coalition, but would probably abstain in the vote after 
the debate scheduled for June 29. "The Chinese principle is 
that `we will go ahead with our own plans' and will not make any 
positive statements on the amendments. The possibility of 
getting support from them on the amendments is virtually zero," 
he said. 
  Mr Tam, a Preliminary Working Committee member who has just 
returned from subgroup meetings in Beijing, said officials from 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office had not given them 
instructions on how to vote. "Whether the final blueprint is 
the original model or any revised proposals will make no 
difference to China," he said. 
  Privately, mainland officials said they were not concerned 
which model Legco adopted. But at a separate meeting with the 
local businessmen, senior Communist Party official Wang Zhaoguo 
warned that the attempt by the British Government to "leave its 
colonial legacy and bring chaos to the territory after it 
retreats is doomed to fail". 
  Mr Wang, the party's United Front Work Department, claimed 
that more Hong Kong people were now aware of the real motives of 
the British Government. "This will be very conducive to the 
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong in the transitional 
period," he said.

<F P=106> [By the "Political Desk"] </F>
  [Text] China yesterday dispelled fears that judges on the 
controversial Court of Final Appeal would have to be ethnic 
Chinese. 
  Only the chief justice would have to be a Chinese national 
without the right of abode overseas, said senior official Lu 
Ping. 
  His disclosure drew a mixed response from the legal 
profession which, along with legislators, rejected the 1991 
Sino-British deal on the court which is to replace the Privy 
Council after 1997. 
  The agreement said the court would consist of five judges in 
any one sitting the chief justice, three local Judges and one 
overseas judge. The legal profession believed more than one 
overseas judge was needed to ensure the court's independence 
under Chinese rule. 
  Law Society chairman Roderick Woo Bun said last night that 
he 
now accepted the "four-to-one" formula. But Simon Ip Sik-on, 
the lawyers' representative in Legco, said Mr Lu's clarification 
did not allay his fears. 
  Mr Lu was speaking after meeting the third batch of Hong 
Kong 
affairs advisers formally appointed in Beijing yesterday. Some 
had raised fears that there might not be enough qualified ethnic 
Chinese to sit on the court. 
  Mr Lu, the head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, 
said: "According to the Basic Law, only the chief justice of the 
court should be a Chinese citizen without foreign right of 
abode. "There is no nationality requirement for other judges, 
not even the requirement of Hong Kong permanent residents." 
  There had been fears that China would propose restrictions 
on 
the "local" judges, saying they should be permanent residents of 
Hong Kong without foreign nationality. But Mr Lu said: "There 
are (now) no ethnic Chinese sitting on the Court of Appeal. If 
it is stipulated that only ethnic Chinese can sit on the court, 
the existing expatriate judges may feel there is no future for 
them and may take early retirement. This may undermine the 
retention of talent." He said China had taken into account the 
shortage of Chinese judges in the territory when drafting the 
Basic Law provisions. 
  Last night, the Bar Association vice-chairman Gladys Li QC, 
said although Mr Lu had clarified some uncertainties in the 1991 
agreement, the makeup of the court was still unacceptable 
because it did not allow flexibility. This would deprive the 
court of the right to choose its own judges, Ms Li said which 
was inherent in the Joint Declaration. 
  Mr Ip said Mr Lu's comments helped clarify the situation, 
but 
would not be enough to win support from legislators. Their 
concern on the restriction of overseas judges serving each trial 
had not been addressed, he said. "There is never any doubt in 
my mind that the three permanent judges need not be Chinese 
nationals or Hong Kong permanent residents," he said. 
  Senior law lecturer of the University of Hong Kong, Johannes 
Chan, said the legal sector believed overseas judges should be 
invited to sit on the court whenever the need arose. "It simply 
could not work if you had to have all the expatriate judges 
barred from the court of final appeal. There is not enough 
expertise among the local legal profession," Mr Chan said. 
"What we are concerned about is that, when there is a need to 
bring in overseas judges from other Commonwealth jurisdictions, 
will we be able to do it flexibly?" 
  Mr Woo said he personally accepted the four-to-one formula 
after Mr Lu's clarification. Permanent judges from overseas 
jurisdictions could be appointed and that would enable more 
expatriate judges to sit in each trial. "It is tantamount to 
imposing no restrictions on overseas judges," Mr Woo said. 
  The Assistant Director of Administration, Annie Tam Kam-lan, 
said Mr Lu's remarks were in line with the Government's 
understanding. A draft bill on setting up the court had been 
submitted to China, but no response had been received. "As it 
is a very complex bill, I think it is reasonable to give the 
Chinese side a considerable amount of time to study it," Ms Tam 
said. The Government had told China it wanted the court to be 
set up by mid-1996. 
  A deputy director of XINHUA (the New China News Agency), 
Zhang Junsheng, said the setting up of the court had been 
delayed by the lack of initiative from Britain. 
  "The fact is that we have had an agreement ready on the 
table 
since 1991 and it is the British side which does not take it 
seriously."

  [Text] China could promise in principle to grant land 
along the airport railway for auction, but it should be included 
in the annual disposal programme, senior Chinese representative 
of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, Guo Fengmin, said 
yesterday. 
  Britain wants to see the 62 hectares granted in one go. 
  "We have adopted a positive attitude towards the land 
disposal programme. But this is not what they called granting 
in one go," Mr Guo said. 
  The Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, Lu Ping, has said China can agree to grant the 
land along the airport railway over the next three years. 
However the final annual land grant had to be approved by the 
Land Commission. 
  But Mr Guo was optimistic. "I think an agreement will be 
reached very soon," he said. 
  Pressure for a deal will increase next week, when the 
influential Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce visits Beijing 
to put across the importance of an early agreement on the 
airport's financing. 
  "We will explain the adverse impact on the Hong Kong economy 
and that of southern China by delays to Hong Kong's vital 
infrastructure projects," said the leader of the delegation Paul 
Cheng Ming-fun. 
  Delay in the completion of Chek Lap Kok would result in lost 
revenue of $5.8 billion in 1997 alone, he said. The chamber 
will also argue for an early decision on the construction of 
Container Terminal No 9. 
  Mr Cheng said growing concerns about the slow progress of 
the work of the Joint Liaison Group, especially on the 
localisation of Hong Kong laws, would also be raised.

<F P=106> ["Special Dispatch": PAI HSING To Stop Publication Next </F>
Month"] 
  [Text] The PAI HSING semimonthly magazine, after more than 
a decade in business, will close next month due to heavy 
financial losses. It is reported that Hong Kong businessman 
Tsui Tsin-tong has lost HK$20 million [Hong Kong dollars] since 
he became a partner of the magazine early last year. 
  Lao Chi-san, the magazine's general supervisor of the 
editorial board, formally informed the staff two days ago of the 
board of directors' decision that the magazine will "temporarily 
suspend publication" after its last edition on 1 June. 
  Lao said last night that the magazine was shut down 
primarily 
due to its unacceptable financial losses. He believed that the 
remaining 20 workers will be laid off and paid in accordance 
with the labor decree, adding that he has no idea whether the 
boss has another publication plan. 
  The magazine was set up by local literary figure Hu Chu-jen 
in early 1980's. A total of 280 issues were published despite 
financial difficulties until early last year, when Tsui invested 
in it. To expand circulation, the semimonthly was changed into 
a weekly magazine on 2 April last month, more workers were 
hired, and more color pages were added. The magazine was 
changed back into a semimonthly again in November last year to 
reduce losses. 
  A source close to the magazine said that Tsui openly had 
said 
he would invest $HK30 million when he became a partner of the 
magazine a year ago. The magazine's losses have amounted to 
HK$20 million. 
  The source added that Tsui had decided to invest in the 
magazine to keep the business going due to his close 
relationship with Hu, the founder and the boss at the time, when 
the magazine was in financial straits a year ago. Tsui was also 
eager to run the magazine better and increase the circulation so 
that the magazine would continue to be published as it had been. 
  After failing to increase circulation through increasing 
investment, changing the semimonthly into a weekly, and altering 
policy, the management decided to change it back to a 
semimonthly. The board of directors finally decided to close 
the magazine because it had incurred losses of HK$1 million a 
month. 
  The number of workers had increased to 70 or 80 after Tsui's 
investment, but it had gradually decreased to 20, the source 
added.

  [Text] Beijing, May 28 (XINHUA) -- Sino-foreign 
cooperation should uphold the principle of being mutually 
beneficial and Marching toward long-term stable relations, 
Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said here today. 
  He made these remarks while meeting with foreign delegates 
attending an international seminar on China's new investment 
style of "B.O.T. (build, operate and transfer)". 
  China's reform and opening to the outside world demand a 
peaceful international environment and China is willing to 
cultivate economic cooperation with foreign nations and 
international organizations, the vice-premier said. 
  Each party should make use of its own strengths in the 
cooperation, he said, adding that many Western countries have 
advanced technology, management systems and abundant capital, 
which could be combined with China's rich natural resources. 
  In addition, he said, China has established a certain 
economic basis. The country also has a huge market potential 
and its labor costs are lower. 
  The combination of both parties will be mutually beneficial, 
he said. 
  The vice-premier told the delegates that China is willing to 
cooperate with foreign partners in various forms, including the 
"B.O.T.", which is quite "acceptable". 
  Senior executives from the World Bank, the Asian Development 
Bank and other international organizations as well as 
internationally prominent companies participated in the seminar, 
which was sponsored by the State Planning Commission.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 May (XINHUA)--The person-in-charge of 
the Ministry of Justice pointed out today that a U.S. Embassy 
official in China has confirmed that a 21 May report by the 
ASSOCIATED PRESS [AP] alleging that China "is still exporting 
prison products" is totally groundless. 
  Pursuant to the relevant provisions of the "Memorandum of 
understanding between Chinese and U.S. Governments on banning 
the import and export of prison products," the Chinese Ministry 
of Justice allowed and arranged for two officials from the U.S. 
Embassy in China to visit Zhejiang Province No 4 Prison and 
other such units between 19th and 21st May. During the visit, 
prison officers answered U.S. officials' questions and provided 
them with information. The visit failed to uncover evidence of 
any violations of the "Memorandum." But AP reporter John 
Leicester, after interviews with the concerned U.S. embassy 
officials in China, claimed in his report that "U.S. consular 
officials in China were informed that these reform institutions 
are still exporting prison products to the United States." 
  Concerned Justice Ministry departments made inquiries at the 
U.S. Embassy in China about this matter. Lorraine Toly, a U.S. 
embassy official, stated that AP's report was mistaken and had 
distorted what she had said in the interview. She said this 
was what she had told the AP reporter: "If the U.S. Customs is 
tipped off that a certain Chinese prison is exporting its 
products to the United States, they will contact, together with 
Chinese authorities, this prison to request an inspection." "In 
this reporter's dispatch, my interpretation became `Toly says 
that U.S. officials have been informed that these reform 
institutions are still exporting prison products to the United 
States.'" This U.S. embassy official said that she was 
"annoyed" by the AP report, and added "I will telephone AP to 
make a complaint." This embassy official has written to the 
Chinese Justice departments concerned, apologizing for any 
possible confusion created by the report. 
  The person-in-charge of the Ministry of Justice reiterated 
that the Chinese Government has always been conscientious, 
responsible, and efficient in implementing the "Memorandum of 
Understanding Between Chinese and U.S. Governments on Banning 
the Import and Export of Prison Products." He pointed out that 
the letter by the U.S. official showed that the 21 May report by 
AP is a complete distortion of the facts.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. Embassy official 
has confirmed that the ASSOCIATED PRESS (AP) story on May 21 
claiming that China is "exporting prison-made products to the 
United States" was groundless, said an executive from the 
Chinese Ministry of Justice here today. 
  In accordance with relevant articles of the Memorandum of 
Understanding on the Prohibition of Import and Export of 
Prison-Made Products, signed by the Chinese Government and the 
U.S. Government, Chinese judicial departments arranged a visit 
by two officials from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to the No. 4 
prison in east China's Zhejiang Province and other units from 
May 19 to 21. Prison officials answered questions from the U.S. 
officials and provided them with relevant materials. 
  There was no evidence during their visit that shows China 
had 
violated the memorandum of understanding, the ministry official 
said. 
  However, in his article AP reporter John Leicester claimed 
that "U.S. officials had information that the camps were 
exporting prison-made goods to the United States..." 
  In reponse to a Chinese Ministry of Justice official's 
inquiries, Lorraine Toly, first secretary for press of the U.S. 
Information Service of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said in a 
letter yesterday that AP reporter John Leicester had made 
"errors" in his article. 
  She said that "what I said was that if U.S. customs 
officials 
receive information that a Chinese prison might be exporting 
prison- made goods to the United States, they then contact the 
Chinese authorities to ask to inspect the prison. 
  "This explanation became in his article: `Toly said U.S. 
officials had information that the camps were exporting 
prison-made goods to the United States...'" 
  The U.S. official said: "I was annoyed by this article when 
I 
read it last week." She said: "I will call ASSOCIATED PRESS and 
complain." 
  In the letter, she also said that she was "sorry for any 
confusion this article might have caused." 
  The Justice Ministry official stressed that the Chinese 
Government has been implementing the Sino-U.S. memorandum on the 
prohibition of import and export of prison-made goods in a 
serious, responsible and effective way. 
  He pointed out that the letter from the U.S. Embassy 
official 
showed that the May 21 AP report by John Leicester was a sheer 
distortion of facts.

  [Excerpt] The powerful People's Liberation Army [PLA] 
establishment has responded angrily to President Bill Clinton's 
ban on guns and ammunition, indicating it is yet another example 
of American "hegemonism". 
  Sources close to the army said, however, because the value 
of 
the targeted imports was no more than U.S.$200 million 
(HK$1.5-billion [Hong Kong dollars] ) the PLA would be 
relatively restrained in making public protests. 
  Moreover, the PLA is still hopeful of the resumption of full 
ties between the Chinese and the American armies, which would 
enable China to import technology with military applications. 
Diplomatic sources said the ban should not jeopardise the first 
steps that had been taken earlier this year towards the partial 
resumption of military links. 
  Chinese Vice-Chief of Staff General Xu Huizi is still 
expected to visit the U.S. in the summer, when he will probably 
look at military-related technology. The sources said that if 
the American army proved amenable to upgrading military 
relations, Beijing would not play up the just-announced ban.

"Clinton Has Made a Wise Decision"] 
  [Text] China issued a statement to express its 
welcome as U.S. President Clinton announced his decision on 
the renewal of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] status and 
declared that all future MFN decisions involving China would be 
delinked from human rights. This is a new turning point in the 
U.S.' handling of its relations with China since the "4 June" 
incident of 1989. Beijing gave a prompt response. The PRC 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement yesterday 
expressing its welcome for the decision, also pointing out that 
Sino-American relations face a favorable historic opportunity 
and that China will continue to adopt measures to develop 
relations between the two countries. 
  Clinton's decision met the expectations of all quarters, 
because facts have clearly shown that if the United States 
continued to apply pressure on the pretext of human rights 
issues, China would never accept it. If China took retaliatory 
action, the attack on the United States would not be 
insignificant. Apart from the United States, Hong Kong's import 
and export trade would also suffer great setbacks, and even 
Southeast Asian countries would be generally harmed. 
  A wise man never takes a decision which harms others but 
does 
not benefit himself, let alone injures himself. Recently, more 
and more figures in U.S. financial and economic circles and 
congressmen have successively issued warnings to Clinton urging 
him not to act rashly in dealing with China's MFN. The focus of 
the U.S. economic recovery is centered on the Asia-Pacific 
region and depends on the vast market of 21st century China, a 
country with a population of 1.2 billion. [sentence as 
published] After China rejoins the GATT, large numbers of 
American products will be exported to China. Under the principle 
of fair competition, Sino-American trade will develop further. 
This will also be beneficial to reducing the U.S. trade deficit. 
  The United States is hoping for the expansion of 
China's vast market America's Boeing and the computer, 
electronic component, telecommunications, and petrochemical 
industries are placing high hopes on the expansion of China's 
vast markets. If the vast market of 1.2 billion with unlimited 
potential was lost because of the so-called "human rights" 
issue, leading to a great increase in unemployment, it would 
have been too late for the decision maker to repent. 
  The change in the situation is independent of man's will. 
China's political and economic position in the present-day Asia- 
Pacific region and in the world can no longer be wantonly 
manipulated by foreign countries. It is incompatible with 
reason to link human rights with MFN status. It could never 
hold ground in the international community. 
  The fact is, in the past five years since the "4 June" 
incident, China has opened its door wider to the outside world 
and has done more to develop its economy and stabilize its 
society. Public sentiment has become calm. The advanced 
nations of the West, Southeast Asian countries, East European 
countries, Russia, and other countries have been competing with 
one another to develop economic and trade relations with China. 
Some figures inside the American government have also realized 
that it is impossible to continue to use human rights issues to 
put pressure on China. Clinton's announcement of the delinkage 
of MFN status renewal from the human rights issue is a wise 
decision. Instead of him losing face, it is beneficial to 
enhancing his prestige. 
  New development in relations between the two 
countries Clinton's decision has also shown that relations 
among nations cannot be separated from mutual benefits in 
practice. If the current close economic relations between China 
and the United States deteriorated because of their dispute over 
human rights, and both sides suffered because of this, the 
American people would never support it. On the contrary, if the 
human rights issue, a hindrance to relations between the two 
countries, is removed, the development of Sino-American 
relations will embark on a new and easy path. 
  Recently, the international community has attached 
importance 
to the development of China's relations with the four central 
Asian countries and the improvement in Sino-Ukrainian and 
Sino-Russian relations. China and Russia are two big nations 
after all. Of course, the development of China's relations with 
the central Asian countries and Russia is not targeted at any 
third country. However, the new cooperation between China and 
Russia in economics, culture, and science and technology will be 
further strengthened through Russian Prime Minister 
Chernomyrdin's visit to China and President Jiang Zemin's visit 
to Russia in September. This is an undeniable trend. 
  Under such a new world situation, no one can tolerate human 
rights elements undermining Sino-American relations and harming 
U.S. interests. Is this not clear enough?

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Has Clinton's Delinking Policy Shown?"] </F>
  [Text] U.S. President Clinton announced yesterday his 
decision on renewing the most favored nation trading status for 
China for another year and abandoning his policy of linking 
trade issues with human rights. This delinking policy is the 
beginning of a change in U.S. policy toward China and will be 
helpful in strengthening and expanding bilateral cooperation in 
economic relations and trade and the vigorous economic 
development in Asia-Pacific region, and promoting understanding 
and ties between peoples of the two countries. 
  The Chinese Government was the first to set out separation 
of 
human-rights issues from the MFN trading status. At first, the 
U.S. Government did not accept it, while believing that the 
linking policy was the most powerful weapon to add pressure on 
China, assuning that China, to acquire MFN status, would 
inevitably make concessions to the tough pressure from U.S. 
intervention in China's internal affairs. Tremendous changes in 
the world situation have taken place over the past five years as 
well as in China's economic strength. Among the world 
industrial powers, the United States is the only one that 
continues to intervene in China's internal affairs by means of 
human rights, whereas other countries have expressed their 
position on the need to separate human rights and economy; 
consequently, the United States has found itself isolated from 
its allies. At the same time, owners of some 100 largest U.S. 
firms share the belief that China is a huge market, and they 
wrote to Clinton demanding a change of the linkage policy. 
  Still greater changes have taken place in Asia; many 
government leaders of Asian countries and regions are unable to 
accept the U.S. policy of linking human-rights issues to MFN 
trading status. They support extending the MFN trading status 
to China without conditions, while criticizing the United States 
for jeopardizing free trade. Asian countries believe that 
should the United States succeed in intervening in China with 
human-rights issues, it would do the same in the rest of Asia. 
Failure to extend MFN trading status to China would inevitably 
harm the Chinese economy, but Asian countries and regions would 
suffer from still greater losses, because the Asian economy is 
closely linked to the Chinese economy. When the United States 
has dealt with China with human rights as a means, they demanded 
Clinton abandon such linking. It is rarely seen that Asian 
countries and regions take the Chinese side with a clear-cut 
stand. A just cause enjoys abundant support while an unjust 
cause finds little support. Clinton had to review his practice 
of forcing China to yield by means of an executive order with 
additional conditions. Because Clinton is facing not only 
China, but also many allies, he must avoid self-isolation among 
Asian countries, the surfacing of anti-U.S. sentiments in the 
region, and entering a cul-de-sac. 
  China is a sovereign country; of course, China will never 
obey the executive order of a foreign president. 
  If Clinton had issued another presidential executive order 
with additional conditions, how would the U.S. President get out 
of the predicament next year, how would he end the show? That 
is a very realistic political issue. 
  A statesman must inevitably foresee the future, and he must 
know others and know himself. Clinton has come to see that 
Bush's tactics remain feasible, it is not advisable for the 
President to stand up front where there is no leeway to turn 
around; that being the case, separation of human-rights issues 
from the MFN is the best choice, while discarding the issuance 
of another executive order is also a wise measure for protecting 
himself from something unfavorable. 
  Among his cabinet, officials in charge of defense and 
national security, as well as the treasury, commerce, and 
agriculture are for unconditionally extending MFN trading status 
to China, and the Secretary of State has been doing his best to 
seek a way to mutual concessions. 
  How should we account for the surfacing of a delinking 
policy 
in the U.S. Congress? First, China's national strength is not 
to be underestimated. Just like Clinton put it yesterday: 
"China is the world's fastest-growing economy; the protection 
of U.S. commercial interests is the decisive factor in making 
this decision." In addition, "China possesses nuclear weapons, 
veto power in the United Nations, and is an important power in 
both Asian and world security"; furthermore the two sides share 
many common interests, including non-nuclear proliferation on 
the Korean Peninsula and environmental improvement. 
  The second reason is China's success in pursuing a peaceful 
foreign policy of independence and taking the initiative in its 
own hands. Five years ago, nobody expected that peaceful 
diplomacy could have scored such tremendous effects. Today, 
those who want to isolate China find that the isolated is not 
China. Clinton said: The extension of the MFN trading status 
"will avoid the isolation of China while making it possible for 
us to establish ties and communicate with China." The why China 
has won friends lies in the fact that it treats others on an 
equal footing, safeguards peace, and refrains from pursuing 
hegemonism. However, by no means will China allow foreign 
intimidation and accept foreign orders. 
  The third cause lies in changes in the world situation in 
the post-Cold War period, and it is not advisable to maintain 
the means of the Cold-War days. Faced with a pluralistic world, 
the United States has failed to find solution to many domestic 
issues, nor has it been able to settle issues in Somali and 
Haiti. The United States must coexist and cooperate in 
consultation with China in friendliness to cut back troubles; 
only then, will it be possible to realize arrangements for 
maintaining U.S. interests. There are all the advantages but no 
disadvantages for the United States to cooperate with China. 
  The fourth cause lies in the fact that if the United States 
wants development with a focus on the next century, there is a 
need to maintain economic relations with China, who is likely to 
become a power in economic relations and trade in the 21st 
Century. The United States will lose the Chinese market, 
whereas Western Europe and Japan will enter it; as one subsides 
here, another will rise, how can the United States maintain its 
advantages in the next century? People in the United States 
require their government to take the lead in adopting a 
pragmatic policy for the U.S. economy. 
  After all, Clinton does have a long-range view, and has 
changed his hegemonist policy toward China; that is an action 
worth welcoming. In the second half of this year, a 
comparatively pleasing trend is likely to surface in Sino-U.S. 
relations.

  [Text] Beijing, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here today that China would like to cooperate with leading 
international monetary and securities companies to strengthen 
the development of industries in the fields of transportation, 
energy and telecommunications. 
  Li made this remark while meeting with Sherman Lewis, Jr., 
vice-chairman of Lehman Brothers company of the United States. 
  The company is the fifth U.S. monetary and securities 
company 
whose representatives he has met recently, Li said. 
  "We appreciate the positive attitude U.S. monetary and 
securities companies have taken to cooperate with China," he 
said. 
  The Chinese Government is sparing no effort to improve the 
development of China's transport, energy and telecommunications, 
fields that have lagged behind the country's economic 
development, and to gradually change the irrational industrial 
structure, he said. 
  There are various ways to carry out cooperation with foreign 
countries in these fields, such as through issuing stocks and 
bonds and through capital loans, Li said. 
  Li added that China has adopted a careful approach to 
issuing 
stocks, which is the most difficult means of cooperation. 
Listed Chinese companies must conform to international 
standards in order to earn a good reputation in the world 
monetary market. 
  He expressed his appreciation to Lehman for helping China's 
Huaneng International Power Development Corporation to be listed 
in New York. 
  The Huaneng Company is one of the five firms China's State 
Council has approved to be listed in the U.S., and Lehman 
Company is the global coordinator and leading manager of 
Huaneng's equity offering in New York. 
  Lewis said that he has paid five visits to China this year 
and made extensive contacts in the country while completing 
background research for the Huaneng listing. 
  The Huaneng Company scored well in management, equipment, 
technical personnel and efficiency, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin said today that China and Russia should consider and 
handle their relations from the commanding strategic height of 
eyeing the 21st century. 
  Jiang made the statement at a meeting with visiting Russian 
Prime Minister V. S. Chernomyrdin. 
  The bilateral relations between China and Russia had entered 
a new phase since President Yeltsin's China visit in late 1992, 
featured by the "healthy and stable" development of the 
mutually-beneficial cooperation in various fields, the Chinese 
president noted. 
  Jiang described the current visit of the prime minister as 
another important event in Sino-Russian relations. The visit, 
he said, would help push the development of relations between 
the two countries. 
  Jiang stressed that in Yeltsin's letter to him at the 
beginning of the year, Yeltsin suggested that the bilateral ties 
should be improved to the level of a "constructive partnership" 
looking towards the 21st century. 
  This idea, Jiang noted, was identical with China's view of 
establishing long-term cooperative ties which should be 
mutually-beneficial, and enjoy stable development, he said. 
  "I also hold that Sino-Russian ties should be considered and 
handled strategically with an eye on the 21st century," Jiang 
said. 
  The postwar history had fully proved that the development of 
the bilateral relations between China and Russia always produced 
great impact on the international situation, he said, adding 
that living in harmony and conducting mutually-beneficial 
cooperation between the two countries was itself a great 
contribution to the peace and development of mankind. 
  China attached great importance to the long-term, 
good-neighborly and mutually-beneficial ties with Russia, and 
would like to further bilateral relations on the basis of the 
principles set out in the Sino-Russian communique, Jiang said. 
  Chernomyrdin said that he had held good talks with Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, and his current visit would be of great 
significance to the Russian economy. 
  The agreements reached during the visit would improve the 
economic and trade links between the two countries, he said. 
  The two countries should also reinforce their cooperation on 
international issues, since the good-neighborly friendship 
between the two sides would not only serve the interests of the 
two peoples, but also benefit peace and stability in the world, 
he said. 
  The two leaders also briefed each other on their domestic 
situations. 
  Chernomyrdin brought Yeltsin's regards to Jiang, saying that 
the Russian president was looking forward to the official 
Russian visit by Jiang this September. 
  Jiang, expressing thanks, said that he also looked forward 
to 
the visit and the meeting with Yeltsin. 
  Among those at the meeting were Qian Qichen , Chinese 
vice-premier and foreign minister, and Russian ministers 
accompanying Chernomyrdin.

  [Text] Beijing, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Russian Prime 
Minister V. S. Chernomyrdin said here today that Russian-Chinese 
cooperation promises a bright future and his visit serves to 
promote bilateral ties. 
  At a press conference before his trip to other Chinese 
cities, the Russian prime minister said he talked with Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng about the furthering 
of bilateral ties and their future development. 
  "We agree that Russian-Chinese ties are moving toward a new 
high," he stated. 
  Both countries held that the 21st-century-oriented, 
constructive ties between Russia and China accord with the 
interests of the two nations and are conducive to peace and 
cooperation in the Asia- Pacific region and the world as a 
whole, he said.. 
  The seven cooperation agreements signed here today embody 
the 
healthy and smooth development of bilateral relations and will 
help to propel the development of economic and trade ties 
between the two countries, he said. 
  His country was satisfied with the rapid growth of Russia's 
economic cooperation with China, Chernomyrdin said. 
  Russia and China share geographic advantages and their 
economies are highly complementary, he said. 
  "We cannot but fully employ these advantages. This is the 
wish of the Russian people and leadership," he said, adding that 
he found with pleasure that this wish is also cherished by the 
Chinese people and leaders. 
  He told the press conference that he also discussed with his 
Chinese counterpart Li Peng the possibility of Russia assisting 
China in revamping the enterprises built with the help of the 
former Soviet Union, and his country's participation in 
hydro-electric projects in the host country. 
  When asked whether China, through developing ties, was 
"filling the vacuum" left in the former Soviet Union's central 
Asian countries, Chernomyrdin said flatly: "In our opinion, 
they are developing the normal, good-neighborly ties of 
friendship." 
  There was no question of China's filling up the vacuum, he 
asserted.

  [Text] Malaysia will attend a meeting of the Organization 
of Islamic Council, OIC [Islamic Conference Organization -- 
ICO], contact group on Bosnia-Herzegovina in New York on 
Wednesday. A statement issued today by Wisma Putra [Foreign 
Ministry] stated that Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad 
Badawi will represent Malaysia at the ministerial meeting. 
According to the statement, the meeting was significant in the 
context of underlining the seriousness and commitment of 
Malaysia and other Islamic countries toward the Bosnians' 
struggle. It was also to intensify the OIC's joint effort to 
end the Serbian aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Malaysia would 
continue to urge the Security Council to lift the arms embargo 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina to enable the Bosnians to defend 
themselves. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Lim Hong Seng, chief of the MCA's [Malaysian 
Chinese Association] Bureau of International Affairs, called on 
the five permanent members of the United Nations Security 
Council to provide adequate protection for the Bosnians. In a 
statement issued in Kuala Lumpur, he said the attacks on the 
safe havens by the aggressors indicated the UN's inability to 
implement its resolution after resolution.

  [Text] Genting Highlands, Sat -- ASEAN Trade Ministers have 
agreed to review the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area 
(AFTA) which includes extending its scope to cover other sectors 
and shortening its time frame. 
  The meeting also decided to set up a policy exchange 
mechanism (PEM) to informally discuss policies and issues of 
common interest in economic development on a regular basis. 
  The first PEM session, which will discuss industrialisation 
policies of ASEAN member countries will be held together with 
ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting in Chiang Mai in September. 
  At a press conference after the informal two-day ASEAN Trade 
Ministers' meeting today, International Trade and Industry 
Minister Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz said: "If there is a need to 
shorten the time frame for AFTA, we will look into it." 
  With the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to be 
implemented next year and the growing importance of the services 
sector, the ministers agreed to look into the possiblity of 
developing an ASEAN framework of co-operation in this sector. 
  This will include non-financial services such as 
transportation and tourism. 
  The ministers also agreed to look into the possibility of 
including raw agricultural products under AFTA. 
  At present, the 15 groups of manufactured products that come 
under AFTA are manufactured and processed agricultural products. 
  AFTA will see trade barriers in ASEAN countries dropping to 
as low as zero to five percent over a 15-year period. 
  The ministerial meeting also agreed that the ASEAN Geneva 
committee will undertake a study on the implications and impacts 
of the various new issues that have been proposed to be 
introduced into the work programme of the World Trade 
Organisation (WTO) which will take over from GATT as of next 
year. 
  "In addition, the ministers have agreed to recommend to the 
WTO that future negotiations on trade and services be carried 
out on a sectoral basis in view of the difficulty and time 
required to deal with many sectors at one time," said Rafidah. 
  The ministers also reiterated ASEAN's stand to strongly 
oppose any attempts to link trade with social issues and labour 
standards as these should be dealt by the appropriate 
international organisations. 
  Other issues that were discussed included the benefits of 
linkages between regional groupings to further enhance 
multilateral trade and the globalisation of trade. 
  The senior economic officials' meeting has been given the 
task of reviewing AFTA. It will make recommendations to the AFTA 
Council. 
  The AFTA Council, which would meet before the Chiang Mai 
meeting, would decide on the various issues and submit a report 
to the Economic Ministers' meeting, Rafidah said. 
  Among those who attended the meeting were Brunei's Minister 
of Industry and Primary Resources Pehin Datuk Abdul Rahman, 
Philippine Secretary of Trade and Industry Rizalino Navarro, 
Indonesia's Co-ordinating Minister for Industry and Trade 
Hartato Sastrosunarto, Indonesia's Minister of Trade Professor 
Dr. S.B. Judono and Singapore's Minister of Trade and Industry 
Yeo Cheow Tong.

<F P=106> [By Saiful Azhar Abdullah] </F>
  [Text] Langkawi, Sun -- Malaysia and Brunei have reached 
an understanding that the overlapping claims on Limbang should 
be resolved through bilateral discussions instead of referring 
the issue to a third party for arbitration. 
  Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today the 
issue would not be referred to the world court for a settlement. 
  "We have an understanding that the issue should be resolved 
and that it should be done at bilateral level," he said at a 
joint press conference with Brunei Foreign Affairs Minister 
Pengiran Muda Mohamed Bolkiah at the end of the first meeting of 
the Malaysia-Brunei Joint Commission for bilateral co-operation 
at the Berjaya Langkawi Beach Resort here. 
  Earlier, Mohamed Bolkiah had expressed satisfaction over the 
discussions to resolve the issue. 
  Abdullah said: "We agree that although this problem is 
sensitive, it is vital that any discussion on the matter should 
be conducted in the spirit of the good relationship, besides 
maintaining the bilateral relations between Malaysia and Brunei." 
  He said Foreign Ministry secretary-general Tan Sri Ahmad 
Kamil Jaffar and Brunei Foreign Affairs Ministry Permanent 
Secretary Datuk Paduka Lim Jock Seng would be responsible for 
establishing the approach to resolve the Limbang issue. 
  Abdullah said the approach to be established by the two 
would 
be referred to the heads of state of the two countries for 
further direction. 
  The issue of overlapping territorial claims on land and 
offshore, along Sarawak's Limbang district rose from Brunei's 
recent declaration of an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off the 
Borneo coast. 
  The 274-kilometre of unmarked border between Brunei and 
Sarawak has hampered the completion of the Pan-Borneo highway 
linking Sarawak, Brunei and Sabah. In addition, it has led to a 
rise in illegal crossings and logging activity there. 
  Limbang, over 3,978 sq km (about half the size of Selangor), 
was annexed from Brunei in 1890 by the then white Rajah of 
Sarawak, Sir Charles Brooke, but parts of the border area were 
not surveyed in an agreement signed between the British in 
Sarawak and Brunei in the 1930s. 
  The joint commission was set up after Prime Minister Datuk 
Sri Dr Mahathir Mohamed's visit to Brunei in August last year to 
enhance bilateral co-operation and pave the way for peaceful 
solutions to problems. 
  Another important consensus reached at the inaugural meeting 
was on the formation of a joint committee on land and maritime 
boundaries to formulate a comprehensive approach and proposal on 
the delineation, demarcation and survey of land and maritime 
boundaries between the two countries for submission to the joint 
commission. 
  Abdullah said the meeting a]so agreed that, pending the 
final 
demarcation of land boundary between the two countries, the 
Malaysian immigration post at Kampung Tedungan and the Brunei 
post at Kuala Rulah would continue to operate without prejudice 
to the outcome of the negotiations on the land boundaries. 
  The meeting also agreed that the committee should formulate 
solutions on any matter referred to it by the Malaysia-Brunei 
joint commission including cross-border problems such as 
administration of law and order, land ownership including claims 
for compensation, smuggling, encroachment and traditional 
fishing areas. 
  Abdullah said Malaysia had expressed the importance of 
expediting the construction of the Pan-Borneo highway to enable 
trade and traffic movement between the two nations. 
  "We are of the opinion that the highway could contribute to 
the development of the East ASEAN Growth Area," he added. 
  Other areas of co-operation discussed include cooperation in 
technical fields, tourism, education and transportation. 
  On technical co-operation, Abdullah said Malaysia was ready 
to train young Brunei diplomats at the Malaysian Institute of 
Diplomatic and Foreign Relations. 
  In response to a question on Brunei's contribution to end 
the 
conflict in Bosnia Herzegovina, Pengiran Muda Mohamed Bolkiah 
said Brunei's stand was similar to other countries and members 
of the Organisation of Islamic Conference. 
  He added that the aid given by Brunei to end the conflict 
was 
similar to that of other countries. 
  Abdullah said he and his counterparts had also taken the 
opportunity to discuss the Bosnian issue and both of them agreed 
to call for an immediate end to the conflict.

  [Text] Kota Marudu, Sun -- More than 2,560 former Parti 
Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party, PBS] members quit the party 
to join the Angkatan Keadilan Rakyat, Akar, [People's Justice 
Organization), a state Barisan Nasional [BN] component, here 
today. 
  They submitted their membership forms to Akar president 
Datuk 
Mark Koding at the community centre. 
  They decided to join the Dusun-Kadazan based Akar after 
Bandau MP George Sangkin left the Parti Demokratik Sabah (PDS) 
[Sabah Democratic Party] to join the party last week. Sangkin 
was with PBS before joining PDS. 
  At the gathering, Koding called on members of the PBS, PDS, 
and Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah (PBRS) [Sabah United People's 
Party] to join Akar. 
  He said the party has set a target of increasing its members 
to 150,000 from the present 50,000 by the end of the year. 
  "Akar being a BN component is in a better position to 
champion the interests of the Dusuns and Kadazans [ethnic 
groups]," Koding said. 
  He said the newly-formed BN state government was sincere in 
wanting to develop the state. 
  "If we continue to isolate ourselves then we would be left 
behind from the mainstream of national development." 
  Akar deputy president and Minister of Culture, Youth and 
sports Pandikar Amin Mulia and Sangkin were also present at the 
function.

  [Excerpt] Kuala Lumpur, Sat -- The Army has proposed 
upgrading its Commando V-150 armoured personnel carriers [APCs] 
instead of buying new vehicles and to overcome the shortage of 
armoured vehicles and save costs. 
  Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said today that 
the army was now facing a shortage of armoured vehicles as it 
had sent a substantial number of such vehicles to protect its 
troops serving under the United Nations in Bosnia and Somalia. 
  He said although the army had about 1,000-odd armoured 
vehicles in its inventory, almost one-third were between 20 and 
30 years old. 
  He added that the choice was between buying new armoured 
personnel carriers, which would cost hundreds of millions 
ringgit or upgrade and refurbish the existing armoured vehicles. 
  "We are studying the cost of such work and hope to make a 
decision soon," said Najib in an interview. 
  Apart from the 200-odd Commando V-150 APCs, the army also 
has 
about 500 German-made Condor APCs, 165 Belgium-made Sibma 
Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) 25 British-made Scorpion AFVs, 
26 Stormer APCs, and an unconfirmed number of Ferret Scout cars. 
  The Scorpions and Stormers are armoured tracked vehicles 
while the others are armoured wheeled vehicles. 
  The most modern of the vehicles are the Scorpions and the 
Stormers, which were delivered in the mid-80s. 
  The Ferrets, he said, were about 30 years old and were used 
by security forces as escort vehicles during operations against 
the communist terrorists during the 1960s and 1970s. 
  The Commandos, which were also used extensively in counter- 
insurgency operations, were delivered in batches from 1973 with 
the last delivery in 1983. 
  MMC Engineering Services Sdn Bhd [Company Limited] (MMCE), a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Malaysia Mining Corporation Bhd, had 
been awarded a contract to modernise the Ferret Scout cars at 
its plant in Nilai, Negri Sembilan. 
  It is also carrying out general overhaul work on the Condors 
which are more than 10 years old with the help of the 
manufacturer, Thyssen Industrie AG Henschel of Germany. 
  MMCE had also been given a contract to reengine some of the 
Commandos from petrol to diesel to save costs and ensure a 
longer engine lifespan. 
  Meanwhile, Cadillac Gage, the United States manufacturer of 
the Commando APCs, said refurbishing the vehicles would cost 
one-third of the price of buying a brand new APC and that it 
would extend the service lifespan of the vehicles by between 10 
and 15 years. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Pragmatic Compromise"] </F>
  [Text] After 14 years of protracted negotiations, Malaysia 
and Thailand signed agreements to jointly explore resources in 
the Gulf of Thailand. What is remarkable is not that it took so 
long, but that any agreement was reached at all. The area which 
is now known as the Joint Development Area, covering 7,250 
square kilometers on the Malaysian-Thai border, has been in the 
limbo of polite dispute -- by mutual agreement it had been 
consigned as a no man's land, which kept its economic potential 
safely out of anyone's reach. All over the world, border 
disputes cause friction between nations -- sometimes enough to 
heat up into war, particularly when the area is rich in 
resources. The recent Gulf War was a classic case. 
  Territorial disputes tend to go on and on because any 
contending nation would consider it too much of a face down to 
concede or compromise -- land area is so integral to the 
definition of national sovereignty that no territory can be 
given away or even shared. National claims are often highly 
complex -- invoking history, geography, security, even ancient 
tradition -- so that disputed areas are left peaceably unsettled 
at best. The political dimension of border issues often leave 
them too intractable for easy mediation -- but there is one way 
out of this impasse. If there is sufficient consensus to subdue 
politics, a practical formula can be worked out to jointly 
extract the disputed territory's socio-economic potential and 
share the gains. Politics, however, has a habit of getting in 
the way of relations between nations, to the detriment of 
economic pragmatism. The attainment of the Joint Development 
Area agreements not only bears testimony to the growing maturity 
of the Malaysia- Thai relationship; it forms a pointer to a path 
of least resistance and mutual benefit in the resolution of 
similar border problems. 
  It is in the nature of claimant countries never to give way 
for an interim deal until the core contention of territorial 
sovereignty is resolved. This centrality of sovereignty in 
border disputes is why even tiny bits of wasteland can turn into 
a fait accompli for all out war. Thus the ability to set aside 
sovereignty for the time being is not only a victory of common 
sense pragmatism over doctrinaire national self-interest. The 
realization of mutual economic gain also works the other way -- 
it diminishes the overriding all-or-nothing significance of 
territorial sovereignty. Most of the region's remaining disputes 
are over uninhabited little outcrops of land which have come 
into contention by being at the far limit of marine boundaries. 
They become sore points only when they offer an economic 
potential, usually in the form of mineral deposits. Rather 
ironically, this potential can also offer a first step to an 
eventual settlement, rather than the pretext for discord. 
  Separating the prompt gains of joint exploitation from the 
decisive outcome of sovereign ownership is as hard as seeing the 
wood for the trees. It not only requires clear-sightedness, but 
trust and self-confidence. In ASEAN, Malaysia and Thailand are 
perhaps the two who most readily see eye to eye on an emphatic 
regional economic focus. Trade and economics are increasingly 
dominating regional security, diplomacy and multilateralism at 
the expense of political ideology. Perceiving and acting on, 
the difference between winning the spoils and sharing the fruits 
is easy enough for the rational person. For nations, however, 
it can be a big step. Malaysia and Thailand have taken that 
step.

<F P=106> [Address by King Norodom Sihanouk at palace audience on 28 </F>
April in Phnom Penh -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Partly indistinct passage appealing for the 
release of abducted foreigners] Now I would like to inform 
foreign and local newspapers that the roundtable betwen the 
Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and Khieu Samphan, 
His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Party of 
Democratic Kampuchea, in principle should take place from 2 to 7 
May to find a common means to build and restore a peaceful and 
independent Cambodia with its territorial integrity to avoid 
fighting. Our compatriots have suffered constantly because of 
this war. I would like to ask that this fighting end and to 
have peace and security for our compatriots everywhere 
throughout the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  Some do not listen to me, to the king. They keep saying that 
they love and respect the king, but in words only not in deeds. 
Therefore, I would like to again beg them to stop fighting and 
turn to talk peacefully to solve the problem. 
  Khieu Samphan, H.E. Khieu Samphan, has said that there is no 
security for him in Phnom Penh. H.E. Hun Sen, Samdech Hun Sen 
and Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh said they can give a 100 
percent guarantee that there will be no danger to H.E. Khieu 
Samphan and other Khmer Rouge members who attend the roundtable 
to talk peacefully. This is 100 percent guaranteed. Despite 
this, H.E. Khieu Samphan and his group do not trust it. They 
want me to take this roundtable to foreign countries instead of 
meeting in our country. The royal government replied that no, 
leaving our country would be a disgrace to our nation, which 
requires that this be held in our country. 
  H.E. Khieu Samphan, please reply to my message, sent to you 
on 24 April. It is already 28 April and H.E. Khieu Samphan has 
not yet replied. Please reply quickly so that I may have enough 
time to organize the roundtable. 
  If he refuses to come to Phnom Penh for the meeting, 
however, 
we will have to postpone it and discuss the matter if this 
cannot be done in Phnom Penh and about the place he wants the 
meeting to be held. In Siem Reap? It seems that he wants to go 
Siem Reap. But I am not sure. Wait until Khieu Samphan writes 
to me and is clear. Since he has not written yet, today I cannot 
inform our compatriots and the foreign and local newspapers. 
So, wait until he answers, then this answer will be 
disseminated. In fact, he wants to meet abroad, China, Korea, 
France, or Indonesia. I do not know. Wait until Khieu Samphan 
writes, then I will inform you. Thank you. [Passage omitted on 
remainder of audience]

<F P=106> [By Kevin Barringtion] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 28 (AFP) -- King Norodom Sihanouk 
called on the nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge [KR] on Thursday 
to confirm whether he would attend peace talks in the capital, 
as the guerrillas kept up military pressure in northwestern 
Cambodia. 
  In a letter to Khieu Samphan, released by the Royal Palace, 
the king said that because the May 2 date for the five-day 
"Round Table of Peace and National Reconciliation" was 
approaching he would like to know whether he and his Khmer Rouge 
delegation would attend. 
  Khieu Samphan had earlier expressed his support for the 
king's proposal to host the talks but then said he was worried 
about his security in Phnom Penh. 
  The king, however, told Khieu Samphan the government needed 
a 
response in order to have sufficient time to arrange his 
reception and assure his security while travelling from the 
airport into the city. 
  A palace official said the king was "very upset" that there 
had been no response from the Khmer Rouge. 
  Co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, however, said he did 
not 
have much optimism for the outcome of the talks. 
  The prince told the diplomatic corps late Wednesday that if 
the "Round Table" failed the government would resurrect plans to 
have parliament formally outlaw the Khmer Rouge, a significant 
move that would signal the end of the government's policy of 
"keeping the door open" to talks with the guerrillas. 
  Meanwhile, Khmer Rouge guerrillas were reported to be 
attacking government troop positions near the border town of 
Poipet for the third consecutive day and, further south, were 
pushing government troops back along National Route 10 towards 
Battambang and away from the guerrilla's recently recaptured 
headquarters at Pailin. 
  "The situation around Poipet and on Route 10 is very 
serious," a government general in the capital said. 
  A government officer, reached by telephone in Battambang, 
told AFP that the Khmer Rouge overran Treng and that government 
soldiers withdrew to 10 kilometers (six miles) away. 
  Aid officials said thousands of people fled the area along 
with retreating soldiers. 
  Treng was the government's original frontline position 
before 
the armed forces launched their offensive and pushed forward 
some 40 kilometers (30 miles) to capture the resource-rich 
Pailin region last month. The Khmer Rouge recaptured it last 
week. 
  The officer, however, said there was no way the guerrillas 
could advance any further towards Battambang. 
  Another government officer said General Pol Saroeun, the 
commander of the forces that attacked Pailin, would be replaced. 
  The officer, explaining the battlefield setbacks, said the 
troops were disillusioned with corrupt leaders and that the 
rank-and-file felt little incentive to risk their lives. 
  In Banteay Meanchey province to the north, General Hun 
Sothera of the government's 12th Division said the Khmer Rouge 
were attacking his positions several kilometers (miles) east of 
the normally bustling border town of Poipet. 
  "The guerrillas were attacking in waves of 150 backed by 
artillery," he said. 
  A Thai military source in the Thai town of Aranyaprathet, 
which is opposite Poipet, told reporters that the government 
appeared to be holding its ground and gaining the upper hand. 
  The general said that most civilians had already fled Poipet 
town and those remaining were ready to leave at any moment. 
  Government police said Khmer Rouge guerrillas killed 30 
civilians when they attacked two pick-up trucks full of people 
trying to flee the fighting. 
  The Khmer Rouge raked the trucks with automatic weapon fire 
and fired rocket-propelled grenades as they were driving along 
National Route 5 away from Poipet. 
  Government troops monitoring Khmer Rouge radio in nearby 
Thmar Pouk said one-armed Khmer Rouge General Prum Su ordered 
his troops to capture the town. 
  "If they failed he said he would cut off his other arm," a 
government soldier said.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 29 (AFP) -- About 25,000 villagers 
have fled heavy fighting between government troops and the Khmer 
Rouge along National Route 10 in northwest Cambodia, aid 
officials said Friday. 
  The residents of villages along the road joining the 
guerrillas' Pailin headquarters to Cambodia's second city of 
Battambang, fled along with retreating government soldiers as 
Khmer Rouge rebels advanced. 
  The rebels backed-up by three tanks, overran a strategic 
government military base at Treng, around 40 kilometers (25 
miles) west of Battambang early Thursday, a humanitarian relief 
official said. 
  It was the first time since 1989 that civilians in the area 
have been displaced on such a large scale by fighting, the 
official said. 
  A government official said government troops destroyed a 
Khmer Rouge tank, before retreating 10 kilometers (six miles) to 
Sdao. Khmer Rouge radio, however, said Friday that the 
guerrillas had seized a government tank. 
  The government troops then regrouped and counter-attacked, 
forcing the guerrillas back out of Treng late Thursday, the 
official said, adding: "But the situation is still quite 
serious there." 
  A Police officer told AFP by phone from Battambang that the 
government troops were back in Treng, but were facing hit and 
run attacks from the Khmer Rouge. 
  A curfew from 8 PM to 5 AM has been imposed in Battambang 
city for fear of guerrilla sabotage, the officer said. 
  Treng was the government forces' frontline position before 
they launched their offensive on Pailin, advancing some 40 
kilometers (25 miles) and capturing the Khmer Rouge's 
resource-rich "capital" on March 19. 
  Government commanders vowed to hold Pailin "forever" but 
lost 
the town to a guerrilla counter-attack on April 19. 
  Explaining the battlefield set-backs, one government officer 
said the rank and file troops were demoralised and disillusioned 
with corrupt leaders and felt they had little incentive to risk 
their lives. 
  The soldiers said they were promised a share of the spoils 
from capturing the gem and timber rich Pailin region which 
bankrolled the guerrilla organisation, he said. 
  In the end, however, most foot soldiers got nothing, with 
some even complaining that they did not receive their meagre 
salaries, while certain superiors laid claim to all valuables, 
he said. 
  Further north in Banteay Meanchey Province, the government 
troops were holding their ground near the normally bustling 
border town of Poipet, a government official said. 
  Heavy fighting has taken place around Poipet over the past 
three days as Khmer Rouge guerrillas tried to capture the town, 
which lies on the Thai-Cambodian border. 
  "But we still hold Poipet. We are still there," the 
government official said. 
  Khmer Rouge radio said six government soldiers were killed 
and 10 wounded, when guerrillas attacked and seized a former 
royalist stronghold at Rumchang and three nearby villages, in 
the Ampil district of Banteay Meanchey Province Thursday. 
  The Khmer Rouge's clandestine radio added that the 
guerrillas 
had destroyed two munitions depots. 
  An official from the Ministry of Defence, however, admitted 
the guerrillas had attacked Rumchang and the nearby villages, 
but dismissed their claim to have captured it. 
  "The Khmer Rouge have already withdrawn," he said adding: 
"They still use the same hit and run tactics, so we did not 
lose Rumchang.

  [Text] For the plenary session of the National Assembly on 
27 April, the election of new representatives remains the most 
important of the four items on the agenda. Nineteen 
representatives, whose actions were incompatible with their 
role, have resigned and the two parties -- FUNCINPEC [National 
United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and 
Cooperative Cambodia] and the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] -- 
have proposed new representatives: 13 from FUNCINPEC and six 
from the CPP. 
  Despite the agenda, some people have expressed concern that 
this issue could raise problems during the examination of the 
validity of the representatives. It has not yet been 
definitively agreed how this will be done. There is, however, a 
hint that the names of the representatives will be read and then 
adopted. Some people are not satisfied with this method, saying 
that this is not truly democratic. They want to discuss each 
new representative. It seems that some new representatives 
would cause problems. Let us wait, however, and see when the 
meeting takes place. 
  Following is the list of names of the outgoing and incoming 
representatives: 
  Outgoing representatives: 
  FUNCINPEC 
  1. Duong Khem (Phnom Penh constituency), currently governor 
of Banteay Meanchey Province; 
  2. Tep Nunnari (Takeo constituency), currently governor 
of Prey Veng Province; 
  3. Meas Sarin (Banteay Meanchey constituency), currently 
governor of Preah Vihear Province; 
  4. Srei Mondol (Svay Rieng constituency), currently first 
deputy governor of Svay Rieng Province; 
  5. Hem Bun-heng (Siem Reap constituency), currently 
second deputy governor of Siem Reap Province; 
  6. Ven Sokhoy (Kratie constituency), first deputy 
governor of Kratie Province; 
  7. Serei Kosal (Battambang constituency), first deputy 
governor of Battambang Province; 
  8. Hing Sarin (Kandal constituency), second deputy 
governor of Sihanoukville;

    [Editorial Report] The 4 March REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA carried a 
report on pages 1, 11 citing the 2 March edition of CAMBODIA 
DAILY concerning an anti-FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an 
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] rally 
held "outside Phnom Penh" on 1 March. Some 200 "former" 
FUNCINPEC supporters claimed that party officials had promised 
to find them jobs during the election campaign, but now those 
officials are demanding bribes for jobs. A demonstrator from 
Kompong Cham--who had worked for FUNCINPEC during the 
campaign--said "Now that FUNCINPEC has won the election, they 
can't find me a job. They even told me it would cost me $400 to 
get a police lieutenant's position." Demonstrators who 
requested anonymity said that FUNCINPEC police "were corrupt 
from top to bottom" with the amount of the bribe based on the 
police rank sought. 
  The CAMBODIA DAILY notes that Co-Minister of the Interior Yu 
Hokkri's response was that "those demonstrators were not among 
those who had been promised vacant positions." However, Yu 
Hokkri did admit that the demonstrators' claims of corruption 
could be valid, saying that "we cannot promise that all of our 
officials are good." The article noted that during and after 
the campaign, FINCINPEC personnel had promised voters jobs as an 
inducement not to support the party's rival, the Cambodian 
People's Party, which these officials had labelled as totally 
corrupt.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article; from NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 29 April </F>
Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The cabinet will be weakened and its ability to 
implement policies will decrease. The budget bill for fiscal 
1994 will somehow pass the Diet, but it will be difficult to get 
Diet approval for politically important policies. It is also 
inevitable that the government's ability to deal with 
negotiations with foreign nations will drastically decrease, and 
consequently it will be more difficult for Japan to restore 
relations with the United States. 
  It can be said the Hata government is short-lived, but the 
situation wherein Japanese politics becomes effete will last for 
some time. It is a matter of course that a decrease in the 
politicians' ability to handle leadership leads to the 
deterioration of the bureaucrats' ability. The bureaucrats do 
their utmost when given tasks to carry out, but now they are 
uncertain about what to do and cannot come up with clear 
answers. In this situation, wherein the cabinet and the 
administration loses their credibility, the role of the private 
sector will become more important. 
  So far, the private sector has relied on the government to 
take measures protecting certain business areas and assisting 
the private sector as well as adopting an economic stimulus 
package. From now on, they can no longer depend on the 
government; in this sense, the private sector will have to take 
the initiative in settling economic friction. Some analysts say 
the bureaucrats oppose deregulation. But there is a voice within 
the private sector which calls for maintaining current 
regulations, thus hampering the bureaucrats' efforts to promote 
deregulation. There are many problems the private sector can 
settle, including an expansion of imports and the narrowing of 
the gap between domestic and foreign prices. In a sense, the 
private sector should lead the government in carrying out 
policies, otherwise Japan's economy will stall. 
  Japanese politics is becoming ill; the present situation is 
also troublesome to the United States. If the Japanese 
Government is stable, the United States can make requests. On 
the other hand, under the current situation wherein the 
government is unstable, the U.S. Government will be in doubt 
over what sort of calls it should make. Even if the Clinton 
government wants to apply further pressure to Tokyo in order to 
win the off-year election, Japan would not be able to come up 
with any measures that could satisfy the United States, and 
consequently the U.S. dissatisfaction with Japan will increase. 
Meanwhile, Japan will be increasingly irritated by the U.S. 
Government. Thus, bilateral relations could worsen even further. 
  If Japan should delay in taking action when certain 
situations worsen--such as the unpredictable problem of North 
Korea's suspected nuclear program--the United States may 
possibly question Japan's attitude, asking: "Is Japan really an 
ally?" In this way, while Japan will lose its international 
status, its diplomacy will involve it in a serious situation.

  [Text] It is believed that behind the recent discord 
between Japan and the United States over the Japan-proposed 
plutonium research project to be undertaken at the International 
Science and Technology Center [ISTC] lie their differing 
positions on plutonium use and the deep U.S. concern that Japan 
may gain access to technology related to weapons of mass 
destruction through the project. 
  The ISTC has been established to provide former Soviet 
scientists and engineers, who once were engaged in developing 
nuclear weapons and missiles, with subjects for research for 
peaceful purpose to help them "change their occupation." And it 
is quite natural for the United States to have concern that if 
these nuclear experts cooperate with Japan in a 
plutonium-related project, information on weapons may 
accidentally flow into Japan. 
  Meanwhile, Russia, which is promoting the development of a 
fast breeder reactor, takes a positive stance on using plutonium 
for the people's living, and has expressed great interest in 
cooperating with Japan. 
  Although the United States tacitly permits Japan's plutonium 
use for peaceful purpose, it has indicated opposition to active 
use of plutonium jointly by Japan and Russia. 
  Tokyo has pledged to donate $20 million to the ISTC. The 
amount is about one-third of the total money to be provided to 
the center. Japan has a desire to absorb the results of Russia's 
research in the fields of fast breeder reactors and plutonium 
use. However, if the choice of subjects for research is limited 
in accordance with U.S. intentions, officials concerned will get 
frustrated.

  [Text] In a bid to prevent former Soviet scientists and 
engineers involved in the development of nuclear weapons from 
emigrating to other nations, Japan, the United States, Europe, 
and Russia have established the International Science and 
Technology Center [ISTC] in Moscow. It has been learned that a 
Japan-proposed plutonium research project to be undertaken at 
the ISTC remains shelved after the United States opposed it. 
The United States is believed to have opposed the project with 
the aim of keeping both Japan and Russia from engaging in 
plutonium research; the U.S. opposition is likely to cause a 
problem for Japan which has promoted the plutonium research 
project under an international framework. 
  The Japan-proposed project is composed of two research 
areas: 
the development of a new-type fast breeder reactor which uses 
lead instead of sodium as a coolant, and research on group 
separation of radioactive waste. Japan has proposed promoting 
the plutonium research project in response to Russian hopes; the 
Japan Atomic Power Research Institute and other Japanese 
research institutes are to cooperate with the project. 
  The ISTC held its first session of the board of governors 
from 17 to 18 March in Moscow. The U.S. Government notified the 
Japanese Government just prior to the session that "it objects 
to any project to promote Russia's use of plutonium." 
  As reasons for objecting to the project, the U.S. Government 
is said to have cited: 1) its concern over Russia's lax 
management of nuclear materials; and 2) the inconsistency of the 
Japan-proposed plutonium research project with the U.S. policy 
of pursuing nuclear nonproliferation. 
  In response, the Japanese Government has notified the U.S. 
Government: "Given the objective of establishing the ISTC to 
prevent Russian scientists and engineers in charge of handling 
plutonium from emigrating, it is inappropriate not to undertake 
plutonium-related research projects." 
  The first session of the board of governors held in March 
did 
not take up the Japan-proposed plutonium research project for 
discussion, and withheld adopting other research projects in 
question. However, the first session decided to undertake 23 
research projects unrelated to plutonium. The cost of those 
research projects is estimated at approximately $12 million. 
  The next session of the board of governors scheduled for 
June 
is set to adopt additional research projects; the Japanese 
Government plans to consult with the U.S. Government about the 
bilateral dispute over the Japan-proposed plutonium research 
project. Some government officials take the view that Japan 
will have to conduct a partial review of the plutonium research 
project to ensure its smooth undertaking.

  [Text] Riyadh, 24 Apr -- Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of 
Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations], who is 
currently visiting Saudi Arabia, met separately with Saudi 
Arabian Foreign Minister Saud al-Faysal bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud, 
Petroleum and Mineral Resource Minister Hisham Muhyi al-Din 
Nazir, and other government officials in Riyadh city on 24 
April. During these meetings, Saudi Arabia expressed strong 
dissatisfaction with the fact Japan completely canceled the 1 
trillion yen joint-venture project to transport crude oil to 
Japan for refining last year, and urged resumption of 
negotiations. Nazir said: "Japan should allow Saudi Arabia to 
participate in subsidiary sectors of the oil business, such as 
refining, in Japan. We are greatly disappointed with Japan's 
withdrawal." Foreign Minister Saud, a member of the royal 
family, also touched on the withdrawal from the project, and 
said: "It is disappointing because we expected much from this 
project." 
  The project involves a joint venture of three Japanese 
companies--Nippon Oil Co. Ltd., Nikko Kyoseki Company (presently 
Japan Energy Company), and Arabian Oil Co. Ltd.--and their Saudi 
Arabian counterpart to build oil refineries in Japan to refine 
Saudi Arabian crude oil and sell the finished products in Japan. 
However, Japan judged this project was not profitable and 
informed Saudi Arabia of its decision to cancel in November last 
year.

  [Text] The Defense Agency and aircraft manufacturers, such 
as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd., have started to study 
remodeling the agency's main fighter plane, the F-15. They will 
seek to improve the capabilities of the plane by adopting new 
eletronic equipment and using materials of stealth capability 
(difficult for radar to detect) on it. It is possible that 
technology related to the next-generation support fighter FSX 
will be used on it. 
  The Defense Agency may include necessary funds for the 
project in the next year's budget demand. If the remodeling work 
starts, it will become an important source of income for the 
domestic aircraft-related industry which is currently suffering 
from defense budget cuts. Some people also hope the remodeling 
project will provide an opportunity for Japan to promote 
technological exchanges with the United States. The project is 
expected to attract attention of the U.S. defense industry. 
  The F-15 is called the "world's best fighter now existing," 
and the Air Self-Defense Force [ASDF] began buying it in 1978 
and now has about 160 of them. Orignally produced by McDonnell 
Douglas, it is now being produced in Japan by Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries under a licensing arrangement. While its successor 
in the United States is supposed to be an F-22, its 
commercialization is being delayed. It is expected that the 
F-15 will need to be used for the next 10 years. That is why 
there are growing voices saying that the plane should be 
remodeled for performance improvement. 
  The Defense Agency had a project for "trial improvement of 
the F-15" included in the Mid-Term Defense Buildup Plan 
(1991-1995), but it has not been undertaken so far. 
  Even if expenditures for it are set aside in next year's 
budget, the expenses for the initial year are likely to be 
limited to those required for research and basic design. Hence, 
the work of actual remodeling will begin only under the next 
term defense buildup plan beginning in 1996. Necessary costs 
are expected to run to more than 1 billion yen per aircraft.

  [Text] On the issue of North Korean nuclear arms 
development, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa stressed on 29 April 
that Japan needs to "deal with the situation within the scope of 
the Constitution." At the same time, he disclosed his view that 
Japan needs to give logistics support to the U.S. military 
should the United Nations decide to impose economic sanctions 
against North Korea. Moreover, on the government's 
interpretation--which prohibits the use of the right of 
collective self-defense--of the Constitution, Kakizawa said: 
"Will such an interpretation allow the Japan-U.S. security 
treaty to function well in dealing with an emergency? The 
people need to talk about it. It is about time for us to review 
the issue." In this way, he disclosed his view that the people 
should discuss interpretation of the Constitution in a direction 
to approve the use of the right of collective self-defense. He 
made these comments during an Asahi TV program. 
  Regarding the right of collective self-defense, Atsushi 
Kanda, director general of the Defense Agency [DA], suggested on 
28 April that there is a possibility that Japan may need to 
change its interpretation of the Constitution. On how Japan 
will deal with the North Korean issue, the ruling 
coalition--while giving consideration to the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ], which attaches importance to the limit of 
the Constitution--reached an agreement, saying, "Japan will be 
prepared for an emergency situation within the scope of the 
Constitution." However, ministers in charge of diplomatic and 
security policies made comments one after another on the right 
of collective self-defense. It seems that they made the remarks 
to suggest a possibility that the Hata administration, following 
the SDPJ's secession from the government, will start to review 
the government's interpretation of the Constitution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Agency Director General Atsushi </F>
Kanda by an unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; date and 
place not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI] Former Prime Minister Hosokawa set 
"promotion of disarmament" as one of the political aims of his 
government. But the position of the Japan Democratic Socialist 
Party [DSP] to which you belong seems to be different. What is 
your party's position? 
  [Kand a] In northeast Asia, there is a military threat 
against Japan. But we should neither unnecessarily strengthen 
our defense capability nor seek disarmament. I do not think 
immediate disarmament is necessary because Japan is faced with a 
difficult defense situation. 
  [YOMIURI] There is a view calling for the exercise of the 
"right of collective self-defense" in the face of the issue of 
North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. What is 
your view? 
  [Kanda] I am rather a dove in the DSP. I want to respect the 
spirit of the Constitution. At the same time, however, I have 
to think of the situation surrounding Japan. 
  [YOMIURI] Do you mean the government's interpretation of the 
collective self-defense right--which the government has said it 
is constitutionally impossible to exercise--will change 
depending on the situation? 
  [Kanda] I think (if the situation surrounding Japan changes) 
various opinions will emerge on security and therefore the 
government's position on ways to ensure security might possibly 
change. 
  [YOMIURI] How do you respond to the U.S.-proposed Theater 
Missile Defense (TMD) plan? 
  [Kanda] Although I want to positively consider the possible 
participation in the plan, this project will cost a huge amount 
of money. We have to give careful consideration to the plan 
with possible efficiency of the plan in mind. 
  [YOMIURI] What is your view of Japan's participation in the 
UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) and the UN Peacekeeping Force 
(PKF)? 
  [Kanda] We want to positively take part in the PKO. As for 
the PKF, we have to consider the possibility of joining the PKF 
in the future, but it has many problems. Therefore, a careful 
study should be made of the possibility of taking part in the 
PKF.

<F P=106> [Article by Masato Sano; from the "The Hata Administration: </F>
Mounting Problems" series; part one of a three-part series: 
"`Tax System' and `Food Control System' To Be Factors of 
Uncertainty"] 
  [Text] The Hata administration will begin on 25 April by 
taking over the tasks Prime Minister Hosokawa left unfinished, 
along with the confrontations and confusion of the coalition 
parties. When we trace the problems which the new administration 
has to face, we realize the new administration's future is full 
of difficulties. 
<H5>  Contradictions Have Erupted Simultaneously </H5>
  During the two-week period beginning 8 April, from when 
Prime 
Minister Hosokawa expressed his intention to resign to when 
Foreign Minister Hata was elected his successor, the coalition 
government opened itself to the public. Though we could imagine 
that the government was facing a complicated situation--as a 
result of confusion involving the national welfare tax and the 
movement to exclude Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura--we now 
realize the contradictions that were smoldering within the 
coalition government for the past eight months erupted 
simultaneously, ignited by the confusion created over the past 
two weeks as represented by the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
maneuver to bring former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign 
Minister Watanabe into their camp. The most serious 
contradiction is the ineradicable confrontation between 
Shinseito and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. As 
far as economic policy is concerned, the two parties are in 
complete disagreement about an increase in the consumption tax. 
  To Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who advocates 
the consumption tax rate being raised to 10 percent, the SDPJ 
appears to be a snake in his bosom. At the beginning of April, 
the SDPJ's Research Commission on the Tax System announced its 
policy to allow an increase of the consumption tax. However, 
the leftwing group within the party and local organizations 
strongly opposed this policy, and as a result the move of the 
"compromising group" was weakened. With the start of the Hata 
administration close at hand, the coalition parties have agreed 
to express their policy "to aim at total tax reform centering on 
an increase in indirect taxes, including revision and abolition 
of the consumption tax." However, this agreement did not mean 
complete concession to Shinseito. There are still a number of 
ways to roll back Shinseito. 
  For example, as it used to do in the past, the SDPJ may 
propose tax exemptions on foodstuffs and tax reductions on 
necessities. These proposals alone will be enough to bring about 
confusion in the discussions on tax reform. There are many 
disturbing factors contained in the coalition parties' 
discussions on tax reform. Needless to say, confusion will be 
created in discussing when and to what extent the consumption 
tax rate is to be increased. Besides, confusion will be created 
in discussing such matters as use of the increased portion of 
the consumption tax; introduction of consolidated taxation on 
acquired assets; introduction of a numbering system applicable 
to taxpayers; ways of dealing with the local consumption tax; 
and so on. Each of these disturbing factors cannot be removed, 
even if the coalition parties try to explain their consistency 
by using the words "policy agreement." On the other hand, the 
government has almost given its commitment to the United States 
that income tax reductions will be effected on a full scale, and 
that the basic plan for public investment in the amount of 430 
trillion yen will be increased. Under the circumstances, it is 
necessary for the government to draw its conclusion in June, 
prior to the opening of the meeting of the heads of state and 
government of the G-7 major industrial nations. 
  Since the days when the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] was 
in 
power, the consumption tax, administrative reform, and 
rationalization of finances have been regarded as inseparable 
problems. After failing to introduce general a consumption tax 
at the time of the Ohira cabinet, the government could introduce 
the consumption tax in 1989, supported by its policy "of 
realizing financial reconstruction without tax increases" and by 
the administrative reform carried out by the Nakasone cabinet. 
Of course, the coalition government is aware of this, and its 
recent policy agreement also refers to administrative reform and 
rationalization of finance. However, the new administration 
faces many difficulties. 
  Administrative Reform Is Shopworn 
  If Prime Minister Hosokawa had continued in power, he would 
have exerted himself in carrying out administrative reform. He 
himself assumed the post of head of the Administrative Reform 
Council's headquarters and framed the outline of administrative 
reforms aiming to remove 682 regulations and review 92 special 
corporations. The outline was about to be adopted at a cabinet 
meeting in the middle of February. Presently, the outline is 
lying on the shelf. The lack of a sense of crisis on the part 
of the bureaucracy is the best evidence that the outline is 
shopworn. 
  The coalition parties have not yet definitely established 
their policy on how to deal with reform of the foodstuff control 
system which is considered the largest among the 682 items to be 
deregulated. With the "Heisei rice confusion" taking place, the 
argument that Japan should supply rice for itself is regaining 
influence among the people. Besides, with domestic rice being 
sold with imported rice, and with enforced pricing of imported 
rice which disregards the price differential between domestic 
and foreign rice, distrust of the foodstuff control system is 
spreading among the people. It is considered inevitable that a 
heated discussion involving both government and nongovernment 
parties will take place when the partial liberalization of rice 
is ratified at the national Diet. 
  Rationalization of finances is also a difficult problem. The 
coalition government is considered a positive financial policy 
group in that it appeals more enthusiastically than any other 
government in the past to the "necessity of dealing with an 
aging society," and in that it is trying to improve both the 
social infrastructure and welfare. However, presently every 
cabinet member is considered to be merely trying to defend the 
interests of his ministry, and the coalition parties' Diet 
members are more conspicuously trying to induce interests to 
their constituencies than did the LDP's Diet members. Under 
such a situation, it is difficult to foresee to what extent the 
coalition government is going to thoroughly review the method of 
distribution of public projects. 
<H5>  Budget Enactment Also a Difficult Problem </H5>
  We should not easily conclude that it is wrong to adopt a 
positive financial policy since the United States is requesting 
Japan expand its domestic demand, and since the Japanese 
economy, with the collapse of the bubble economy, has become 
more dependent on public expenditures. Enterprises are not 
likely to moderate their efforts for restructuring and for 
inventory cutbacks, even if their profit may be recovered to 
some extent. The shifting of production to foreign countries 
due to a strong yen is directly hitting local enterprises, thus 
making them more dependent on public projects. 
  No evil influence has so far surfaced in the business 
condition due to the considerable delay in the budget debate. 
However, the budget debate should not be postponed for an 
unlimited period. It has already become difficult to carry out 
in advance the national projects for the first half of the 
current fiscal year; large projects also remain untouched. 
  However, what is more important is to see the situation from 
a medium-range viewpoint. Formulating the budget bill for 1995 
is to be started as soon as the 1994 budget is approved by the 
Diet. The basic figures in estimating the budget for the next 
fiscal year are not likely to be easily determined. If at the 
time of determining the basic figures, the pace of the business 
recovery is considered stable, then the government has to decide 
if it should follow the traditional pattern restricting 
government spending or if it should continue to increase its 
spending to avoid the shock that may be created by reduced 
expenditures. The government is required to make a severe 
choice. On one hand, the government should fear that 
enterprises might become physically weak, thus causing 
industries to leave the country. On the other hand, the 
government must face the problem of financial deficits and 
prevent the bubble economy from occurring again. 
  Every determination is to be made by Prime Minister Hata. In 
any event, decisions should not be made by Ichiro Ozawa. The 
role of the prime minister is to make "decisions" and not 
coordinate or make preliminary consultations.

<F P=106> [Article by commentator Naoki Tanaka: "Japan's Involvement </F>
in Security of East Asia and Deregulation"] 
  [Text] As with the Hosokawa government in the past, the 
Hata government will have to develop an interim character since 
the relationship between individual politicians and voters has 
yet to be established regarding specific policies. People 
inside and outside the government are expected to make brisk 
moves towards a parliamentary majority. How then should voters 
respond to the interim government? There is no other way but to 
establish a concrete criteria for judging whether the interim 
government is acceptable, taking Japan's world position into 
consideration. My criteria for such judgment is based on the 
following two points. 
  First, Japan should be involved in East Asian security. 
Japan should continue to study how to dissuade North Korea from 
developing nuclear weapons and how to specifically apply 
Japan-U.S. security arrangements to the East Asian situation on 
the premise that Japan takes such initiatives within the 
framework of the Constitution. The Diet should clarify Japanese 
involvement in the use of U.S. military bases and supply depots 
in Japan. 
  Nuclear weapons must be loathed. If the democratic system 
proves its solidity in blocking North Korea from developing 
nuclear weapons, this would create a dramatic condition for the 
security of East Asia. It goes without saying that blocking 
North Korea from developing nuclear weapons would clear up 
unfounded concerns over a rise of militarism in Japan. 
  Second, Japan should create a climate for expanding private 
investment by abolishing economic regulations. The abolishment 
of such economic regulations will inevitably spark fierce 
competition among enterprises, and some will suffer defeat. 
However, goods and services provided by competitive enterprises 
will greatly benefit consumers and users. This logic has never 
been tested. 
  Abolishing government regulations will turn the public 
sector 
around. But will the Hata government take the lead in 
abolishing such regulations? 
  The aforementioned points are my criteria for assessing the 
Hata government.

  [Text] Following the inauguration of the cabinet of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted an emergency 
opinion poll on 28 and 29 April on the support rate for the Hata 
cabinet. The telephone poll conducted surveyed 1,500 eligible 
voters across the nation. According to the survey results, 56.8 
percent of the respondents supported the Hata cabinet while 25 
percent did not support it. This indicated that the Hata 
cabinet is enjoying high public support despite the view at the 
Diet that "the administration is treading on thin ice." 
However, about 60 percent of those surveyed denounced the 
ruling coalition's formation of the new parliamentary group 
without the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] as 
"coercive," and said the SDPJ's secession from the coalition 
"was not favorable for the cabinet." In this way, the survey 
also highlighted public criticism of the new cabinet. 
  The top four scores recorded in past YOMIURI SHIMBUN polls 
on 
cabinet supporting rates soon after cabinet inauguration were: 
71.9 percent for the Hosokawa cabinet; 60.5 percent for the 
Tanaka cabinet (1972); 55.7 percent for the Miyazawa cabinet 
(1991); and 51.5 percent for the Takeshita cabinet (1987). 
Because those polls were conducted through interviews, it is 
difficult to compare them exactly with the latest telephone 
survey. However, it can be said that the support rate for the 
Hata cabinet, from the viewpoint of survey figures, is the third 
highest of the above-mentioned cabinets. 
  As for their reasons for supporting the Hata cabinet, 45 
percent of the pollees said that the cabinet "can be expected to 
do something new." While 24 percent of the pollees said they 
"can trust the prime minister," 16 percent said "neither the 
Liberal Democratic Party nor the SDPJ has joined" the Hata 
cabinet. Moreover, only 7 percent of the respondents said they 
support the cabinet because "it is stable." On the other hand, 
32 percent of the respondents did not support the Hata cabinet 
because "it is unstable." In stating their reasons for 
disapproving of the cabinet, 22 percent said the cabinet "cannot 
be expected to do anything" while 17 percent said they "cannot 
trust the prime minister." 
  Asked about the term of the Hata cabinet, 35 percent of the 
respondents said they want the cabinet to last "as long as 
possible," 20 percent "two or three years," and 20 percent 
"about one year." About 15 percent said they want the cabinet 
to "resign as soon as possible." 
  There was a list of four emergency tasks facing the Hata 
cabinet such as: "review of the tax system"; "economic 
pump-priming measures"; "the issue of DPRK's (North Korea's) 
suspected nuclear weapons development"; and "Japan-U.S. 
relations." Asked to pick the top priority issue from the list, 
64 percent picked "economic measures," 25 percent chose "review 
of the tax system," 4 percent mentioned "the issue of North 
Korea's nuclear weapons development," and 3 percent picked 
"Japan-U.S. relations." Thus, the overwhelming number of 
respondents wanted the cabinet to tackle domestic issues. 
  Regarding the way Shinseito and other parties formed the new 
parliamentary group, which led to the SDPJ's secession from the 
administration, 57 percent of the pollees were strongly 
critical, saying "it was coercive." While 27 percent of the 
pollees thought "it was necessary to form the new group," 6 
percent felt "it was only natural."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Can We Expect of This Government?"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has finished forming 
his cabinet, and the Hata government has finally been launched. 
  When a new government is formed, the normal practice for a 
newspaper is to write an editorial expressing hopes for what it 
should do or to give advice involving words of encouragement and 
expectations. But this time we cannot bring ourselves to do 
that. To our sorrow, we cannot find words for the government 
which has lost the trust of the people even before it set sail. 
  The only thing we can ask of it is not to think about 
prolonging its life, but to consider it a step toward the next 
stage of the reorganization of the political arena. 
  The prime minister may be asking himself the following 
question: "Cannot spilled milk be put back into a pot?" No 
sooner was he named prime minister than his friends engaged in 
trickery and chased the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
out into enemy hands. It will not be easy to regain the trust 
once lost. 
<H5>  Feeling Uneasy When Trusting the Government </H5>
  There are many kinds of people in this world. There are 
people who wanted Hata to become prime minister and those who 
did not. Among those who wanted him, there are also many types, 
ranging from those who support Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
to those who support the SDPJ. Even among those who did not 
want him, there are those who thought: "Well, if this is the 
given condition, I hope he will do one thing or another." 
  Being put in charge of the government of a nation means 
being 
entrusted by such different kinds of people to run their 
fortunes and destinies. That is the mission of a government, 
and that is why the position of prime minister is so weighty. 
  Of course, it would be impossible to take the demands of 
everyone into consideration. Sometimes he has to make decisions 
the people do not like. Nonetheless, he must be acutely aware 
at all times that there are many kinds of people. Only then can 
there be trust in politics that goes beyond simple principles 
and assertions. 
  This need is even greater in the case where a coalition 
government is in power. Whatever the reason may be, if a 
government thinks it should expel colleagues who have different 
views, the public will not feel at ease with such a government. 
  We are not saying we cannot understand the feelings of the 
parties which are irritated by the SDPJ. We often feel that way 
ourselves. But the SDPJ is now in agony and at a loss amidst 
changing times. This in a way represents a picture of the 
Japanese who have lived through postwar Japan. Before 
everything else, the party was a partner of the coalition. 
  If Shinseito says it has forgotten about this in the heat of 
the power struggle, no one will believe the party when it 
discusses welfare, human rights, or fairness. After all, if the 
people of Shinseito are the kind of people who had misread the 
thinking of the SDPJ--which was not so difficult to 
understand--we wonder if they can ever understand the delicacies 
of diplomacy. 
  We are not defending the SDPJ. We are only defending the 
basic rules of democracy. Naturally, if the SDPJ were the party 
which produced a prime minister and did the same thing, we would 
be writing the same thing about it in this editorial. 
<H5>  Shocked by the Transformation of a New Foreign Minister </H5>
  When the Hosokawa coalition government was formed last 
summer, we welcomed it. That was because we thought the new 
government--which was a coalition of parties gathered under the 
banner of "change"--would put an end to the bad habits of the 
long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. But the Hosokawa 
government went on to change its color, and the new Hata 
government turned out to be a complete betrayal of our 
expectations. 
  The new cabinet indeed can be said to be the realization--in 
a different form--of the once-considered idea of the 
"LDP-Komeito-Democratic Socialist Party government." The 
joining of Mutsuki Kato, known as "the grey senior official" in 
the Lockheed scandal, with the cabinet also symbolizes its 
deviation from a government aimed at political reform. 
  We do not want to talk more about the faces of the 
Shinseito-led cabinet--which creates the illusion that the LDP's 
power faction has returned to life--but we do want to at least 
refer to Mr. Koji Kakizawa, who gained the post of foreign 
minister in the cabinet. He became the head of a new party after 
it failed to install Michio Watanabe as its head. 
  We would like to recall that it was none other than Kakizawa 
who represented the LDP in an interpellation of the cabinet at 
the plenary session of the House of Representatives on 7 March. 
He was the one who harshly criticized "the absence of economic 
and foreign policies" in the Hosokawa government, and demanded 
"the coalition dissolve itself and hand over government to the 
LDP." 
  Politics may be an element of life. But politics should 
involve a certain degree of justice and integrity. What sort of 
philosophy of life would the majority of the people--who will 
not get on in the world at all--learn from this method of 
transformation practiced by people like Kakizawa?

  [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito 
obtained eight and six ministerial seats respectively in the 
Hata cabinet formed on 28 April. The two parties hold almost 
three-quarters of the posts in the new cabinet. The "Ichi-Ichi 
line" between Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and 
Komeito Secretary General Ichikawa took the lead in managing the 
political situation during the Hosokawa administration. However, 
following the secession of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger] from the coalition 
administration, Shinseito and Komeito will play a leadership 
role in the Hata administration as well. Giving consideration 
to possible criticism regarding zoku Dietmen [influential Diet 
members concerned with specific issues], in the past such posts 
as transportation and construction minister, whose tasks are 
linked to the interests of private companies, have mainly been 
given to the SDPJ. However, these posts as well as the minister 
of posts and telecommunications have been given mostly to 
Komeito because Shinseito hesitated to accept them. 
  Of the seven posts that had been given to the SDPJ and 
Sakigake during the Hosokawa administration, three went to 
Shinseito, two to Komeito, and one to the Democratic Socialist 
Party [DSP]. The remaining post, plus one other, which had 
previously been given to the Japan New Party [JNP], went to the 
"former reform group" and the Liberal Party, which joined the 
coalition after last August. Since it did not have suitable 
candidates, when the Hosokawa cabinet was formed the JNP gave 
three ministerial posts which had originally been allocated to 
the same party to ordinary citizens who were not politicians, 
and two posts to the United Social Democratic Party. Although 
the number of ministerial posts the JNP had was reduced to two, 
Yoshio Terasawa became the party's first minister. 
  Since the Hata administration, which is a minority 
government, is expected to face difficulties in managing state 
affairs, and since some Shinseito members, mainly young members, 
feel uneasy about the future, Shinseito will give priority to 
"strengthening the party structure." The party decided to allow 
the retention of their party posts to Kozo Watanabe, acting 
secretary general who assists Ichiro Ozawa; Hajime Funada, 
standing board member; and Keisuke Nakanishi, standing board 
member who is in charge of elections and organization. 
  Regarding the selection of a chief cabinet secretary, which 
was a focal point of the recent cabinet lineup, Shinseito 
studied the possibility of appointing to the post Takashi 
Yonezawa, secretary general of the DSP, in order to strengthen 
cooperative ties. However, Prime Minister Hata wanted to choose 
a person who could act as liaison between Hata and Ozawa. 
Therefore, an agreement was reached to give the post to Hiroshi 
Kumagai, former international trade and industry minister and a 
close associate of Ozawa. Kumagai is the one who began forming 
the new group called "Kaishin." However, some senior Shinseito 
members who are critical of the hasty formation of "Kaishin" are 
coolly assessing the selection of Kumagai, saying: "It is a 
selection designed to make the organizer of `Kaishin' assume 
responsibility for the blunder until the end." Regarding a 
proposal to appoint Mutsuki Kato to the post of finance 
minister, Shinseito members strongly opposed it, saying that "he 
joined the party only six months ago." Instead he became 
agriculture, forestry, and fisheries minister. 
  Keeping an eye on the second reorganization of the political 
world, Komeito brought back to the party former Posts and 
Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki, who is a candidate 
to be the next Komeito secretary general. Wakako Hironaka, 
former director general of the Environment Agency, was initially 
scheduled to remain in her post. However, since Minister of 
Construction Koji Morimoto and Mikio Oomi, director general of 
the Science and Technology Agency, were elected from the Kinki 
bloc, Komeito gave consideration to the need to maintain a 
regional balance. Because of this, Toshiko Hamayotsu, a member 
of both the Komeito executive committee and the House of 
Representatives who was elected from the Tokyo electoral 
district, was chosen among Komeito female lawmakers to be 
director general of the Environment Agency. 
  Hata wanted to appoint a member of the group which recently 
joined the coalition to a ministerial post, hoping it will 
encourage LDP members to secede from their party. Accordingly 
Koji Kakizawa, who once was parliamentary vice minister of 
foreign affairs, was appointed to the post of foreign minister 
whose visit to the Middle East is drawing near.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade </F>
and industry, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
correspondent; place and date not given; from the "Interview 
With Hata Cabinet Members in Charge of Economic Matters" series; 
one of two interviews comprising first part of series: "All 
Hata Cabinet Members Will Work To Defuse Japan-U.S. Friction"; 
first paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] The Hata cabinet was inaugurated on 28 April. How 
will it tackle economic tasks such as early enactment of the 
1994 fiscal budget and the resumption of the stalled Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks? NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN has interviewed 
Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and industry, on 
how he intends to carry out these pressing policies. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are there any prospects for resuming 
the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks? 
  [Hata] The cooperative system between Japan and the United 
States is important for the world economy, so all members of the 
Hata cabinet will work towards resuming the stalled framework 
talks. Although the Japanese Government is trying to conclude 
the framework talks prior to the Naples summit, I intend to use 
every contact with U.S. Government officials as an opportunity 
to discuss ways to resume the stalled talks. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The United States imposes one-sided 
sanctions against Japan. What do you think of this U.S. posture? 
  [Hata] Neither Japan nor the United States should engage in 
eccentric action. Now that moves are afoot worldwide to create 
the World Trade Organization (WTO), Japan should have a candid 
exchange of views with the United States in order to dissuade 
the latter from invoking the Super 301 provision against Japan. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you think Japan should deal 
with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons? 
  [Hata] Japan needs to cooperate with any decisions made by 
the United Nations. Since North Korea intends to settle the 
issue through dialogue, it is premature to discuss specific ways 
to resolve the issue. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to promote 
deregulation? 
  [Hata] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] is being asked to press ahead with deregulation. MITI 
needs to make further efforts towards deregulation. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you see Japan's economy? When 
do you anticipate Japan's economy recovery? 
  [Hata] Housing and certain commercial electrical goods are 
showing favorable indicators, but Japan's economy is still mired 
in recession. The budget has a great effect on the economy, so 
I want to get a budget bill for fiscal 1994 enacted in the Diet 
at the earliest possible date. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is growing criticism that the 
bureaucracy is conspicuously controlling the policy decision 
process. 
  [Hata] Such criticism attests to the excellence of Japanese 
bureaucrats. While bureaucrats have expert knowledge, 
politicians make their decisions based on broad perspective. 
Politicians and political parties decide on policy matters and 
take responsibility for what they decide. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you have concrete measures to 
reduce Japan's trade surplus? 
  [Hata] Japanese private enterprises are largely responsible 
for Japan's surplus trade. I doubt the administration set 
certain numerical targets for reducing Japan's trade surplus. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the controversy 
over the resignation of former Industrial Policy Bureau chief 
Naito? 
  [Hata] Personnel changes are to turn the bureaucratic 
mentality around and make bureaucrats carry out their duties in 
a fair and neutral manner. MITI has tried to conduct personnel 
changes in that manner since Naito's resignation triggered the 
controversy.

<F P=106> [Interviews with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and Finance </F>
Minister Hirohisa Fujii by YOMIURI SHIMBUN; place and date not 
given; from the "Interviews With New Cabinet Members" column] 
  [Text] Interview With Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] You assumed the post of foreign minister 
after breaking away from the Watanabe faction of the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Have you ever been advised by 
former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe? 
  [Kakizawa] He has encouraged me. He also has advised me to 
work as hard as possible. He has warmly encouraged me. Even 
now, Mr. Watanabe and I share the same aspirations. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
were broken off. How are you going to deal with them? 
  [Kakizawa] It is important for Japan to work out a 
macroeconomic policy and relax bureaucratic regulations to open 
up its markets. It is also important for Japan to flesh out the 
term "objective criteria," the establishment of which the United 
States has demanded. But Japan should not relent on its 
principle of opposing any numerical targets. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to deal with the issue of 
North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons? 
  [Kakizawa] The coalition partners have agreed on a policy to 
deal with the issue, but in a sense, the policy is ambiguous. It 
can be said that with the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] breaking away from the coalition, its ambiguity can be 
removed. Since our cabinet is a minority government, I intend to 
deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons while seeking the understanding of other 
political parties. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think about legislation to 
prepare Japan for emergencies? 
  [Kakizawa] If Japan is ahead of other nations in taking 
domestic legislative initiatives, it would have an adverse 
impact on Japan's relations with other nations. I intend to deal 
with the issue while carefully examining what Japan should do to 
resolve the issue. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to handle Japan's bid for 
a permanent membership on the UN Security Council? 
  [Kakizawa] I will work more aggressively than ever to get 
other nations to understand that Japan's affiliation with the UN 
Security Council as a permanent member will serve to reform and 
strengthen the United Nations instead of waging a campaign like 
election campaign to win support from other nations. 
<H5>  Interview With Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii </H5>
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Now that the SDPJ has broken away from the 
coalition, will it not be difficult for the Hata government to 
draw a conclusion on the issue of reforming the current tax 
system by the end of June? 
  [Fujii] The ruling coalition parties have set up the Tax 
System Reform Council and the council has continued to study 
ways to reform the current tax system. Many of the SDPJ members 
share our view. The LDP has studied ways to raise the 
consumption tax and the value added tax since 1968. The 
coalition partners are examining the possibility of discussing 
the issue with the SDPJ and the LDP. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The enactment of a budget bill for the 
fiscal 1994 is being delayed. What is your opinion? 
  [Fujii] The delay in the enactment of the budget bill should 
not adversely affect the people's lives. The only thing we can 
do is to ask the Diet to begin deliberations of the budget bill. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
remain stalled. What measures are you contemplating to resume 
the talks? 
  [Fujii] The Finance Ministry has announced that it would 
voluntarily relax regulations in the insurance and monetary 
sectors. I intend to work for their relaxation. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Hosokawa government was criticized for 
being led by the bureaucracy. 
  [Fujii] I cannot understand why the Hosokawa government was 
criticized that way. I have continued to speak of the 
inevitability to reform the current tax system. My conviction is 
to reform the system. I believe that Finance Ministry officials 
will act in tune with my conviction. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How are you going to deal with the issue 
of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons and 
the issue of remittance by ethnic Koreans in Japan to North 
Korea? 
  [Fujii] Japan's foreign policy honors decisions made by the 
United Nations. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the current level of 
interest rates? 
  [Fujii] Long-term interest rates have risen temporarily, but 
they remain at a low level. The coordination of interest rates 
is not the only policy to stimulate the economy. At the present 
stage, we have to calmly watch how the economy is moving.

  [Text] In an interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN and other 
media on 30 April, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai 
commented on how Japan will deal with a possible UN decision to 
impose economic sanctions over the issue of the DPRK's (North 
Korea) nuclear arms development, saying: "We will abide by a UN 
decision because Japan is a member nation. At the same time, 
however, we have no choice but to act within the scope of the 
Constitution." However, he avoided to comment on the issue of 
the Self-Defense Forces' support activities, such as providing 
supplies to the U.S. military's naval blockade, saying: "Since 
I am a member of the government, I have to be careful about this 
issue." On the government's policy that use of the right of 
collective self-defense is contrary to the Constitution, Kumagai 
said that "there is no need to change the interpretation of 
previous administrations." 
  Moreover, on the coalition's policy to do its best to enact 
a 
rezoning bill for the single-seat and proportionate 
representation system by having discussions during the current 
Diet session, Kumagai said: "We quite agree with this idea." 
He stressed that the bill should be approved even if the 
government has to extend the Diet session.

<F P=106> [Article by columnist Naoki Tanaka: "Deregulation Should Be </F>
Made the Top Priority Task of the Hata Cabinet"] 
  [Text] As long as the Hata cabinet is starting out as "a 
reform government"--although of a minority ruling coalition--it 
should announce its basic policy on reform to people at home and 
abroad. One of the important goals of reform should be the 
abolition of unreasonable economic regulations. The former 
Hosokawa government adopted an "administrative reform outline," 
and the key point of it was to abolish the regulations. The 
Hata administration is responsible for taking this over and 
implementing it. 
  As a way of implementing it, I hope, Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will issue instructions to individual cabinet members on 
the need for deregulation and will evaluate all of his cabinet 
members based on how the deregulation program has been achieved. 
In case regulatory government offices want to leave some 
regulations as exceptions, they must once again explain reasons 
for them to the people. Otherwise, the people will not support 
the minority ruling coalition. 
  In the tax system reform, what must come first is the 
reengineering (drastic renovation of business operations) of the 
government sector through deregulation; nonessential expenses in 
the government sector should be cut down through deregulation 
and other actions. If reengineering is done successfully, it 
will become possible to raise the consumption tax only by a 
small rate. 
  The former administration set forth the concept of the 
national welfare tax. Assumptions made on the scale of tax rate 
increase at that time should change if the deregulation and 
administrative reengineering are going to be implemented. The 
taxpayers will not be able to understand a hike in the 
consumption tax, which is based on "rough estimates" and does 
not take this point into account. 
  In a policy of the coalition adopted before the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan bolted, it was agreed to "work out a 
decision on the tax reform--basically increasing the ratio of 
the indirect tax--by the end of June." But if regulations are 
to be drastically revised, it will be impossible to reach a 
decision on the tax system reform, including the consumption tax 
hike, by the end of June. What the government should do is keep 
income tax cuts in effect even after 1995, continue deregulating 
until the economy recovers, and pursue the tax system reform 
plan, including the consumption tax hike. 
  What is noteworthy in the new cabinet lineup is that Komeito 
produced posts and telecommunications minister, transport 
minister, and construction minister and that it thus has become 
an important component in the government. But these are posts 
of ministries known for having so many regulations. Will these 
three ministers be able to push on with deregulation? The 
public will come to find out the party's true stand on it.

  [Text] On the launching of the Hata government of minority 
parties, the bureaucrats of Kasumigaseki, Tokyo, in general 
think: "With its fragile base, the cabinet will have trouble 
pursuing reform policies." The political situation is likely to 
become insecure, and there is spreading concern regarding 
matters like North Korea over which the ruling and opposition 
parties are expected to differ. According to an official of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF]: "Now 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] has returned to the 
opposition camp, the bureaucrats' power might become weaker than 
under the Hosokawa government." An official of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] admitted: "If the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ get together, the 
Diet will become shaky; it will be difficult to implement 
policies." 
  The Hosokawa government, which had the SDPJ on its side, was 
able to actively pursue policies on rice market liberalization 
and programs on the taxation system and pension reform, led by 
bureaucrats, but under the new government there is concern 
because "it is unclear how the SDPJ will act," as an official of 
the Ministry of Health and Welfare noted. 
  Another official of the MAFF said: "It will become difficult 
for us to work not only on opposition parties but also on ruling 
parties; it will not be easy to implement policies." There are 
also many who think that with the birth of the new coalition 
government a change will occur in the present trend of 
"bureaucrats having more power than politicians." 
  But as far as such issues as Japan-U.S. relations--an area 
where there are almost no policy differences between the ruling 
and opposition parties--are concerned, an official of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] said: "All we have to do is 
continue to do the things we were doing." Officials of MOFA are 
pleased to have Koji Kakizawa as their new minister, saying, "It 
should be easy to work with him since he is familiar with 
foreign affairs." 
  Likewise, the Economic Planning Agency has many expectations 
of its new director general, Yoshio Terazawa, who is well versed 
in economics and known for his "fine background" including his 
time as president of Nomura Securities U.S.A. (according to a 
senior official of the agency). Meanwhile, the Ministry of 
Finance, which has the task ahead of reforming the taxation 
system, is happy that its minister will remain in post. Vice 
Minister Jiro Saito said: "He is my senior as a bureaucrat, and 
we can work like one man." 
  The views of ministries differ regarding the fact that the 
Hata government strongly favors Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
members. 
  In MITI, which experienced the "incident of intervention" by 
former MITI Minister Kumagai to remove a senior official, the 
general response was: "The man whom the vice ministers have to 
watch closely has changed from Kumagai (known to be close to 
Ozawa) to Hata (known to be close to Prime Minister Hata); we 
should be able to work with him better." 
  In the case of the Ministry of Transport, which has a new 
minister from Komeito, the picture was one of relieved ministry 
officials. The officials said: "If we had someone from 
Shinseito, we would have the difficult problem of what distance 
we should maintain with Shinseito on the one hand, and with the 
LDP on the other."

  [Text] Business leaders are concerned about the formation 
of the Hata government lest the Hosokawa government-initiated 
"reform policy lines," such as political reform, take backward 
steps. Takeshi Nagano, chairman of Nikkeiren [Japan Federation 
of Employers' Associations], commented: "It is true that the 
base of the minority ruling parties' government is insecure." 
  Masaru Hayami, head of Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of 
Corporate Executives], said: "The important thing for business 
circles is to see the 1994 budget passed without delay." Where 
the budget is concerned, as the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] is willing to support its passage, business circles are 
relatively optimistic. On other matters like taxation system 
reform, however, a staff official of the Keidanren [Japan 
Federation of Economic Organizations] said: "We cannot draw a 
picture." 
  Ken Moroi, a vice chairman of Nikkeiren, noted: "What 
concerns us most are actions on international issues like 
Japan-U.S. relations and North Korea." He added: "The nation 
is now in a state of difficulty. I hope the coalition will deal 
with these international issues in consultation with the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] and the SDPJ. It is necessary for the 
coalition parties to be humble." 
  Even as far as administrative reform, including 
deregulation, 
is concerned, Nagano said: "The SDPJ should cooperate since it 
was part of the team that prepared the Hiraiwa report during the 
Hosokawa government." Another top business leader said: "The 
coalition parties are basically weak; I hope they and opposition 
parties like the LDP and SDPJ will cooperate and tackle pending 
issues together." 
  For a while after the SDPJ bolted from the coalition, there 
were voices in business circles saying: "The coalition parties 
should seek cooperation with the LDP." But since then it has 
been learned that the LDP and SDPJ have decided to cooperate in 
parliamentary operations, and business circles have not been 
able to follow the swift shifts and shuffles within and among 
the parties. 
  Tadahiro Sekimoto, a vice chairman of Keidanren, holds a 
severe view, saying, "I hope this cabinet will achieve visible 
results within the next two months. Otherwise, it will turn out 
to be a short-lived government." Business circles do not like 
the prospect of the lower house being dissolved and the next 
general election being conducted under the current medium 
electoral district system. As such, all that business leaders 
are saying essentially is: "This is no time to talk about who 
the ruling parties are or who the opposition parties are. All 
of them should get together to deal with policy matters."

  [Text] Open criticism, which is unusual, erupted against 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leadership at a Dietmen's caucus 
on 27 April. This followed reports that party Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa and a handful of party leaders had decided on a new 
position on the question of the new parliamentary group 
"Kaishin," which was the major reason why the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan's [SDPJ] bolted from the coalition government. 
Most of the Shinseito Diet members, even party executives, had 
not been informed of the decision. 
  It was an eruption of discontent about the way a small 
number 
of senior executives like Ozawa have made decisions unilaterally 
on policies and Diet operation matters in the past. 
  The man who opened the verbal attack was first-term Dietman 
Kiyoshi Ueda. He asked for an explanation from party officials: 
"The news media report that a retraction of the concept of 
`Kaishin' is being considered. What is going on?" Acting 
Secretary General Kozo Watanabe replied: "No such thing is 
being talked about. We are now making final efforts to have the 
SDPJ return to the coalition government."

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Finance Hirohisa Fujii by </F>
unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN correspondent; place and date 
not given; from the "Interview With Hata Cabinet Members in 
Charge of Economic Matters" series; second of two interviews 
comprising first part of series; "Improvements Being Made in 
Substantiating the Consumption Tax"] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the 
current economic situation? 
  [Fujii] We are in a very delicate stage. Economic 
indicators in some areas are good; in other areas, they are not 
so good. We need to make the economy grow for we are at an 
important stage. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] It is said that deliberations on the 
fiscal 1994 budget will be delayed. 
  [Fujii] It should not have a negative impact on people's 
everyday life. I will ask the Diet to start budget 
deliberations as soon as possible. I know we have a system 
which is supplementary to a tentative budget. However, it is 
too early for us to talk about it now. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The minority ruling government needs 
the cooperation of both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to achieve tax 
reform. 
  [Fujii] A considerable number of people are beginning to 
understand that we have no choice but to reduce the income tax 
and substantiate the consumption tax in order to prepare for an 
aging society. We are beginning to share common views with the 
SDPJ. We have no choice but to seek the understanding of the 
people and the parties. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you no think that a compromise, 
such as changing the consumption tax to welfare tax, is needed 
for the coalition to achieve the other parties' understanding? 
  [Fujii] Many people protested against an earmarked tax 
[mokuteki zei] when the consumption tax was introduced. Many 
are still against it. We may use the revenue from this tax 
mainly for welfare services, but I do not know about an 
earmarked tax. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think administrative 
reform is needed to increase taxes? 
  [Fujii] We have been seriously trying to achieve 
administrative reform. The ruling parties are still meeting on 
it. I hope they will come up with concrete ideas and not 
abstract plans. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How about foreign exchange markets? 
  [Fujii] The fundamental of foreign exchange is to reflect 
the fundamentals [as published]. This was confirmed at a 
meeting of the finance ministers and central bank presidents 
from the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is the appreciation of the yen 
natural because the trade surplus is a fundamental? 
  [Fujii] I do not think so. The trade surplus is merely one 
item. I am sure the interest rate level, economic trends, and 
unemployment rates are also fundamentals. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to tackle the 
Japan-U.S. framework talks? 
  [Fujii] It is important for us to get the economic recovery 
back on track by promoting the current economic management plans 
in order to settle the issue. It is also important for 
international society to seek economic harmony. We have been 
trying to ease regulations regarding insurance and financial 
services. In addition, we also need to ease other regulations 
as well to act in harmony with international society.

the House of Representatives being dissolved for a general 
election once the fiscal 1994 budget is passed. He said: "Some 
people say the next election should be held only under the 
single-seat electoral district system. But if there is no 
prospect for finding a breakthrough in the current political 
stalemate, there will be no other choice [but to hold the 
election under the current medium district system]."

  [Text] With the rice supply running short, the business of 
agencies importing rice for personal consumption via the 
international postal service is growing. Although in principle 
the Foodstuff Control Law bans rice imports, it makes an 
exception by allowing a person to import up to 100 kg of rice a 
year through the international postal service. Businesses have 
been importing rice from the United States, China, and 
Australia. The rice has nearly the same taste as Japanese-grown 
rice. Japanese consumers are increasingly showing their 
interest in the rice because they can legally buy the rice at 
low prices. For this reason, a growing number of Japanese 
consumers have been buying the rice. The Food Agency has become 
increasingly wary of the personal importation of rice through 
the international postal service, saying, the systemic agency 
business for personal rice imports is problematic. 
  The Akita Citizen Consumer Cooperative (headed by Nobuo 
Takayama with its head office located in Akita City) embarked on 
the business of importing rice from China on 20 April. The 
imported Chinese rice will be sold to its members at the head 
office and at cooperative run retail stores. The cooperative 
intends to import the Chinese rice grown and harvested in 
Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Lianoning Provinces. The cooperative 
plans to receive orders from its members by 8 May and will then 
import the Chinese rice when the orders reach 30 tons. The 
imported Chinese rice will be shipped to members by mail. 
  The imported Chinese rice will sell for 3,500 yen per 10 kg, 
which includes postal charges and consumption tax. The 
cooperative intends to import the Chinese rice in cooperation 
with the volunteer group non-governmental organization (NGO) and 
the Japan Technology Development Assistance Organization's 
Dailian office, which is in charge of making business contacts 
with Chinese rice suppliers and of shipping the rice to Japan by 
air. For this reason, each member hoping to buy the Chinese 
rice is required to pay a 500 yen NGO membership fee. 
  Universal Export's Japan branch office (in Kuroishi City, 
Aomori Prefecture), an American trading firm in Seattle, 
Washington, has imported Australian rice to Japan since late 
last year. The Australian rice is grown in New South Wales and 
the office places orders upon receiving purchase requests from 
Japanese consumers. The Australian rice has been sold for 9,900 
yen per 18 kg and 10,450 yen per 19 kg. The Australian rice is 
transported by ship to Hong Kong and then shipped to Japan by 
air because of high international postal rates. According to 
the American branch office, it has received orders for 50 tons. 
  Imos Corporation [name as published], a Japanese trading 
firm 
based in California, supplies Californian rice to Japanese 
consumers via Hong Kong. President Hiroshi Ishikawa originally 
planned to import the Californian rice by air to sell to 
Japanese consumers, but later shelved the plan and decided to 
set up his company in California out of fear that the systematic 
importation of foreign rice through the international postal 
service might violate the Foodstuff Control Law. His company 
has sold the California rice upon receiving customer orders for 
$75 per 18 kg. 
  Rice importation through the international postal service 
has 
been allowed as an exceptional measure for personal consumption. 
Toshihiko Tsuruoka, Food Agency director general, told a House 
of Representative's Committee on Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries session last May that the Food Agency would allow a 
person to import 100 kg of rice a year. His statement drew 
attention at the time. The Food Agency takes the position of not 
allowing any systematic rice importation through the 
international postal service. But the rice imported through the 
international postal service is popular among Japanese consumers 
because it is cheaper than the domestic rice and taste almost 
the same. On many occasions, public organizations have not 
checked whether the rice imported through the international 
postal service carries pesticides or mold. Therefore, importing 
foreign rice is likely to raise sanitary safety questions.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 28 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
leading topic continues to be for the newspaper "ARDYN ERH" the 
spring session of the Great State Hural of Mongolia. The 
newspaper informs that at the session of the parliament there 
has been set up a working group for elaborating the issue on 
changes and amendments to be made to the law on the elections. 
Included into the composition of the working group are 
representatives of all the nine political parties of Mongolia. 
The group is headed by the chief of one of the standing 
committees of the country's parliament A. Bolat. A great 
prominence is being given to the upcoming official visit to 
Mongolia by the premier of the State Council of the People's 
Republic of China Li Peng. The "ARDYN ERH" being the central 
official organ of Mongolia, publishes on its first page the 
biography of the Chinese premier. The newspaper also carries an 
interview of vice chairman of the National Development 
Department of Mongolia L. Demberel given to the newspaper's 
correspondent. In this interview he assessed the current visit 
by Li Peng to Mongolia as a new step in the development of 
friendly relations between Mongolia and China. 
  The newspaper informs its readers about the regular sitting 
of the government of Mongolia. The members of the cabinet have 
considered a number of draft laws including the draft laws on 
the procedure of holding meetings and demonstrations and on land. 
  So far there has not been provided the final expertize in 
reference to the causes of the catastrophe of a military 
"MiG-21" plane happened in January of the current year not far 
from Ulaanbaatar, said in an interview to the newspaper the 
assistant of the general officer commanding of the armed forces 
of Mongolia N. Nurzed. The materials of the case associated 
with this air catastrophe is being now re-examined in view of 
the open letter by widows of the drivers died during the 
accident which was sent addressing the president of Mongolia, 
the newspaper writes. The newspaper "ARDYN ERH" informs that in 
connection with the death and funerals of the former President 
of the USA R. Nixon for the embassy of the USA to Mongolia and 
representatives of the US Peace Corps in Mongolia yesterday was 
made a nonworking day in mourning for the deceased. 
  Under the headline "Whether the Russians Managed To Have 
Produced a Red Mercury Weapon" the newspaper publishes the 
material prepared on the base of a telecast by the English 
television devoted to the new secret weapon of mass destruction 
made obstensibly by the Russians. 
  The last issue of the newspaper "ARDCHILAL" is completely 
devoted to the political hunger strike of a group of activists 
of the Mongolian Democratic Association and the Union of 
Mongolian Students and the Mongolian Social Democratic Party 
which lasted holding 13 days at the central square in the 
Mongolian capital. There are available numerous reports made 
from the spot, responses and telegrams received from citizens in 
support of the participants of the hunger strike. 
  The trade unionist newspaper "HODOLMOR" carries the 
information about the "Temuujin Mench" company the workers of 
which had organized recently a strike. The report was made on 
the traces of the information obtained from the workers of the 
Mongolian-English joint venture. It is noted here that the 
workers of the venture are being mainly young girls are working 
in hard working conditions. They have to be working 12 hours a 
day with only a 15-minute break. 
  The newspaper provides a letter by the leader of the Party 
of 
Mongolian Herdsmen and Farmers B. Gansuh addressing a group of 
ex-members of this party who have joined in the created recently 
party for Mongolian traditions after quitting his party. The 
main content of his letter lies in that the party of Mongolian 
herdsmen and farmers exists and will be existing as an 
independent political force standing for the interests of the 
herdsmen and farmers of Mongolia.

<F P=106> [From the "International Report" program] </F>
  [Text] Vietnam's prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, says he is 
ready to establish full diplomatic relations with the United 
States immediately. In a rare interview, Mr. Kiet told Radio 
Australia's Hanoi correspondent, Christopher Kramer, that 
disputes between the two sides over property and assets left 
over from the Vietnman War presented no hurdles to normal ties. 
And the 71-year old Vietnamese leader indicated his willingness 
to stay at the helm of government for another couple of years, 
despite being past retirement age. From Hanoi, Christoper Kramer 
filed this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Kramer] In his first interview since the 
lifting of the U.S. trade embargo in February, Mr. Kiet spoke 
for almost an hour about regional issues and relations with 
Australia and the United States. He said the recent visit of 
Prime Minister Paul Keating had seen a frank exchange of views 
based on friendship, leading to agreement on bilateral and 
regional issues. 
  Regarding the U.S., Mr. Kiet said the lifting of the embargo 
had improved the conditions for the continuing search for 
American MIA's and the disputes over property and assets left 
over from the Vietnam War presented no obstacles to full 
normalization of relations with Washington. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] Vietnam 
intends that the normalized relations between the United States 
and Vietnam inevitably will come. We are ready at any point of 
time for that because the normalized relations between the two 
countries are not only in the interests of the two countries but 
also in the interests of the region and the world over. 
  [Kramer] On the domestic situation, Mr. Kiet said the 
elimination of poverty was his government's main priority. But 
asked whether Vietnam wanted to move toward some form of 
multiparty democracy, he said maintenance of political stability 
was more important. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] Looking 
around as well as looking at the situation in Eastern Europe, we 
could see that there is such a lesson. 
  [Kramer] Mr. Kiet did, however, commit the communist party 
to continued political as well as economic reforms. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] We 
clearly see the interrelationship and the mutually supporting 
relationship between the economic reform and the political 
reform -- these two areas are closely linked with each other and 
one gives [word indistinct] for the other. 
  [Kramer] Since Mr. Kiet came to office in 1992, he has 
presided over Vietnam's spectacular return to the world 
community, but on the domestic front he faces a widening gap 
between rich and poor and the daunting task of managing the 
country's transition from communism to free market economy. 
  Along with the president and communist party leader, he is 
widely expected to step down at around the time of the next 
communist party congress late next year or in early 1996. But 
having seen him in action on the tennis court, I can report that 
the prime minister is fighting fit and in no mood to step down. 
  [Kiet in Vietnamese fading into English translation] If I am 
be able to contribute to the development of the country in line 
with the already identified projects, and if my personal health 
permits me, and if there is a need expressed by the people, then 
I try my best. [end recording]

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 29 -- Following are large excerpts 
from a joint press statement released at the end today of 
President Le Duc Anh's four-day official friendship visit to 
Indonesia: 
  -- On 27 April 1994, President Le Duc Anh held talks with 
President Suharto at the Independence Palace. The two leaders 
had discussions on the orientation and measures to further 
strengthen the friendship and multi-sided cooperation between 
Vietnam and Indonesia as well as on international regional 
issues of mutual interest. 
  -- The Vietnamese side warmly welcomed Indonesia's active 
and independent foreign policy and greatly appreciated the 
important contributions made by Indonesia to the cause of peace, 
stability and development in the region and in the world in 
general it also stressed that Indonesia as chairman of the 
Non-Aligned Movement has actively contributed to the 
consolidation and enhancement of the Non-Aligned Movement's 
role, to the intensification of its activities and to the 
promotion of South-South cooperation and North-South dialogue. 
Vietnam confirmed its continued cooperation with Indonesia in 
these activities. 
  The two sides expressed satisfaction over the positive 
development of the relations between the two countries, 
especially since the visit to Vietnam by H.E. [His Excellency] 
President Suharto in November 1990 and the visit to Indonesia by 
H.E. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in October 1979 the two sides 
once again confirmed their resolve to preserve and develop the 
good relations of friendship, good neighbourliness and 
multi-sided cooperation on the basis of the ten principles of 
the Bandung Conference and the Five Principles of Peaceful 
Co-Existence. 
  The Vietnamese side expressed gratitude to Indonesia for 
having shared the latter's valuable experience with Vietnam in 
national construction and development and extended assistance to 
personnel training in such fields as science and technology, 
health, population, etc. The two sides noted with satisfaction 
the good bilateral cooperation on population control and family 
planning, considering it as a concrete manifestation of the 
cooperation between developing countries. The two sides agreed 
to further strengthen this cooperation by helping to ensure the 
success of the forth-coming World Population Conference to be 
held in Cairo in September 1994. 
  With a view to intensifying the multi-faceted cooperation 
between the two countries, the two sides signed the memorandum 
of understanding [MOU] on tourism cooperation. The two sides 
agreed to further prepare for an early conclusion of the 
agreement on avoidance of double taxation and the agreement on 
postal and telecommunications cooperation. 
  The two sides were of the view that further efforts should 
be 
generated to fully utilize the great potentials of the two 
countries for promoting and broadening the cooperation in the 
interest of development of their respective countries. To this 
end, the two sides agreed to reconvene the Joint Commission for 
Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation so as to review 
and look for measures to increase trade and promote investments 
between two countries. The two sides also agreed on the speedy 
implementation of the signed agreements and MOUs. 
  The two sides noted with satisfaction the development of 
talks on the delimitation of the continental-shelf boundaries 
between the two countries. In this spirit, the two sides agreed 
to accelerate the negotiations on the basis of the results 
achieved so far, and the 1982 UN Convention of the Law of the 
Sea as well as the general international law principles and 
practices in accordance with the long traditional friendship 
between the two peoples with a view to bringing it to a 
conclusion as soon as possible for the sake of cooperation and 
development of the two countries. 
  The two sides took note of the signing of the tripartite 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the principles and 
arrangements relating to returning Vietnamese non-refugees from 
Indonesia among the Republic of Indonesia, the Socialist 
Republic of Vietnam and the UNHCR in Hanoi, 2 October 1993. 
They were of the view that greatest efforts should be taken by 
both sides in cooperation with the UNHCR to accelerate the 
implementation of the above mentioned MOU. 
  The two sides were pleased to note the positive changes and 
the strong trend towards peace, stability, cooperation and 
development in Southeast Asia. The two sides welcomed the 
efforts and initiatives made by countries in the region to 
encourage dialogues aimed at improving mutual understanding and 
peacefully settling the disputes and differences between 
countries in this region. The two sides reaffirmed their 
continued determination to broaden the relations of good 
neighbourliness and cooperation with all countries in the 
region, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit thus 
contributing to the building of a Southeast Asia of peace, 
freedom, neutrality, cooperation, prosperity and free from 
nuclear weapons. 
  The Vietnamese side highly valued Indonesia's and other 
ASEAN 
countries' support for Vietnam's observer status in ASEAN and 
its participation in the ASEAN functional committees as well as 
in a number of projects of ASEAN functional cooperation in such 
fields as science and technology, culture and information, 
environment, health, tourism, and human resources development. 
  The two sides noted that there was a common understanding 
between Vietnam and ASEAN on Vietnam's joining ASEAN as a full 
member. The Vietnamese side reaffirmed its readiness to work 
for the continued strengthening of multi-sided cooperation with 
ASEAN, and to prepare, together with ASEAN, the early entry of 
Vietnam as full member of ASEAN. Both sides believed that this 
development would not only be in keeping with but also in the 
interest of peace, cooperation and development in the region. 
[sentence as received] 
  The Indonesian side was of the view that Vietnam-ASEAN 
cooperation and Vietnam's participation in the forthcoming ASEAN 
Regional Forum in Bangkok would serve as an important and 
practical contribution to strengthening the trend of peace, 
stability and cooperation in the region. 
  The two sides shared the view that the changes in the global 
and regional situation are creating new opportunities as well as 
new challenges. This situation required all countries in the 
world to work together on the basis of peaceful co-existence, 
mutual respect of each other's independence and sovereignty, 
non-use of force or threat to use force, the settlement of 
disputes through peaceful negotiation, non-aggression, 
non-interference in each other's internal affairs and 
non-imposition of one country's will on the other. Both sides 
reaffirmed their determination to make continued contributions 
to the struggle of mankind for international peace and security 
and for national independence and prosperity. 
  President Le Duc Anh expressed his heartfelt gratitude for 
the warm welcome and generous hospitality accorded to him and 
his wife as well as his delegation by President Suharto and 
madame, the Indonesian state and people. President Le Duc Anh 
extended an invitation to President Suharto and madame to pay an 
official visit to Vietnam. President Suharto accepted the 
invitation with pleasure, the timing of which will be arranged 
through diplomatic channels.

<F P=106> [Bui Quoc Huy Article: "Peaceful Evolution, the Successive </F>
Strategic Scheme"] 
  [Text] The imperialists and hostile forces have been 
persistently striving in every way to sabotage the world 
revolutionary movement. Ideas of the ways to eliminate 
socialism with "peaceful evolution" had been nurtured since the 
40s in this century when the reality of the power balance did 
not allow the imperialists to use military intervention when it 
so wished to topple socialism. At the end of the 80's, the 
imperialists and hostile forces sparked by the successes of 
"peaceful evolution" in Eastern European countries and the 
former Soviet Union, pushed forward their activities in the hope 
of obtaining "victory without war" in the remaining socialist 
countries. 
  In our country, "peaceful evolution" and the activities of 
the hostile forces have been and are developing new traits, 
contents, forms, and maneuvers. They make clear their 
intentions, aims, and action plan for the peaceful evolution 
scheme in Vietnam. The contents of the scheme are comprehensive 
and cover all economic, political, ideological, cultural, and 
diplomatic areas. Numerous measures and forms are being 
deployed flexibly. These measures are unilateral and 
multilateral, with violence and without, and use governmental 
and non-governmental bodies. They are peaceful and non-peaceful 
evolution measures, in-depth and wide, vigorous and in careful 
order using well-coordinated forces. 
  They constantly attack us on the political and ideological 
fronts aiming to erode trust in the party leadership, separate 
the party and the people, deny the glorious past of the Vietnam 
revolutionary party. They also openly criticize 
Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought. Our choice of 
socialism and the renovation undertaking is denounced with the 
hope that it will make people lose their confidence and question 
their ideals. Their maneuvers are virulent and well-organized 
because they combine secret with overt activities, with the 
support and assistance of hostile forces to fight socialism in 
our country as well as in others. 
  As an adjustment to the strategy, the hostile forces use 
"human rights" as a major striking force against us. They 
elevate "human rights" and "democracy" into strategic issues. 
They blatantly accuse us of "religious oppression", "democratic 
coercion", and "human rights violations". They demand that we 
release "political prisoners", using it as an excuse to 
interfere in our internal affairs, and advocate support for 
dissident forces, while demanding for constitutional amendments, 
political pluralism, an opposition- type multiparty system, and 
so forth. 
  The hostile forces are also accelerating their secret 
activities, especially in intelligence-gathering and espionage 
such as in stealing national secrets. They also strive to sow 
discord within our organizations, first within our party, then 
state organizations, the army, and police. They expect that 
from the ties forged by investment cooperations and other 
projects such as cadre training, humanitarian aid, and so forth, 
they will be able to convert viewpoints and ideals within our 
party, and entice people with faulty thinking, and those who are 
undecisive, biased, opportunistic, and greedy for either glory 
or material gain. They will wait for the right opportunity to 
plant spies and create "flag" wavers. From there they will form 
opposition organizations and unite their internal forces to 
become the opposition of the state in the "peaceful evolution" 
scheme from within. When the opportunity comes they will 
quickly turn to violence. 
  In parallel to increasing aid and directing exiled 
reactionary organizations comprising overseas Vietnamese to 
carry out sabotage activities from abroad, they are also make 
contact with reactionary groups within the country to cause 
disorder, to carry out sabotage activities and political 
instability. All the methods of non-violence, peace, 
"reconciliation", "harmony" in the struggle for "democracy", 
"freedom", "prosperity" will be combined and slowly developed to 
gain legitimacy, popularity, and internationalization, leading 
the way for foreign forces to interfere and pressure us. 
  It is obvious that peaceful evolution activities of the 
hostile forces is the next step of the basic strategy they have 
been applying so far. But the scheme is now being carried out 
vigorously, resolutely, with timely adjustments by new and more 
cunning maneuvers. 
  The success of their scheme, however, is not for them to 
decide. The destiny and future of our country is decided by our 
party and people with correct policies and proper measures. 
  In implementing the renovation initiated by the Seventh 
Party 
Congress, our people has scored important achievement in all 
economic, political, cultural, social, external relations, 
national defense, and security aspects. We have continuously 
freed ourselves from the obstruction and isolation of the enemy, 
and created a new position in the international community. Our 
country is experiencing new opportunities as well as new 
challenges, and the challenges emerging from opportunities. 
  It is therefore the duty of the entire party, people, and 
army to fight against peaceful evolution. The prime and urgent 
duty is to protect the fatherland of socialist Vietnam. 
  To ensure the strength and ability of our country for 
development, we have to maintain political stability, continue 
our renovation for socioeconomic development, and fight an enemy 
taking advantage of our economic reforms. We have to take care 
of the people's livelihood at the same time while safeguarding 
security and national defense, expanding external relations, 
reforming and rectifying the party, and consolidating the 
party's leadership role, and the flesh and bone relations 
between the party and the people. We also have to improve the 
management efficiency of the state mechanism and the socialist 
legal system, and strive to heighten the people's sense of 
vigilance by making them understand clearly the enemy's scheme 
of peaceful evolution. By being alert, flexible, resolute, and 
determined in our struggle, we will absolutely defeat all 
"peaceful evolution" plots and maneuvers.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Defense Agency head Atsushi 
Kanda on Monday [2 May] confirmed that the government has been 
making a study of possible emergency legislative arrangements in 
connection with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development 
programs. 
  In a television news program of ASAHI National Broadcasting 
(ASAHI TV), Kanda said,"at the present stage, (the government) 
has been making a study on preparedness for various situations." 
  The defense agency chief said, however, that the government 
has not yet reached a political decision on the matter. Kanda 
was quoted as saying, "the government has not yet decided to 
implement (emergency legislative arrangements)." 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa expressed a positive stance 
on 
the formulation of emergency legislative arrangements, during 
the same TV news show. 
  Kakizawa commented that the Foreign Ministry will hold 
comprehensive talks on the matter with the Defense Agency, when 
he was asked if there is disagreement on the issue among cabinet 
ministers. 
  In another ASAHI TV program Sunday, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai expressed reservations about the wisdom of early 
Japanese action in response to North Korea's suspected nuclear 
weapons programs, saying Japan is still hopeful that a 
diplomatic solution can be achieved. 
  Such legislative measures apparently include revision of the 
Self-Defense Forces Law, which enables SDF planes to carry 
Japanese citizens residing overseas in an emergency. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata told reporters Monday morning 
that he has not received any report by government 
representatives on the emergency legislative measure 
preparations. 
  Hata said the government seems to be making a study (of the 
matter). But he added that he has not yet received any report 
on the issue. 
  Hata made the remarks when he was asked about the reported 
preparation of emergency legislative arrangements disclosed by 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi kumagai in the Sunday TV program. 
  A government source on Monday morning said, "the government 
has completed its preparations of security emergency legislative 
arrangements, but the government will not submit drafts to the 
diet." 
  The source said that the government wants to avoid 
triggering 
a controversy, mindful of the fact that the Social Democratic 
Party [Social Democratic Party of Japan], which was the largest 
group in the former coalition, opposes such legislative measures.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Japan's exports to China 
via the Sea of Japan swelled but its two-way trade with South 
Korea slumped in 1993, the Japan External Trade Organization 
(Jetro) said Monday [25 April]. 
  Jetro said China-bound exports from 14 Japanese prefectures 
facing the Japan sea jumped 36.5 percent in value to 106.5 
billion yen last year due chiefly to strong demand for 
Japanese-made machinery. 
  Imports from China which arrived in the 14 prefectures, 
however, declined 4 percent to 162.0 billion yen as growing 
domestic energy demand there resulted in fewer exports of crude 
oil and petroleum products to Japan. 
  The Jetro report also said exports to and imports from South 
Korea, the biggest trading partner for the 14 prefectures, 
dropped 8.3 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively, reflecting 
Japan's economic recession. 
  As a result, the regions' exports to four countries on the 
other side of the sea -- China, South Korea, North Korea and 
Russia -- increased a paltry 1.7 percent to 404.4 billion yen, 
while their imports from these nations were down 4 percent to 
697.7 billion yen. 
  Of the 14 prefectures, Fukuoka Prefecture in western Japan 
is 
the biggest exporter for the four countries, followed by 
Yamaguchi Prefecture, also in western Japan, and Hokkaido. 
  Yamaguchi was atop the other 13 prefectures in terms of 
value 
of imports, trailed by Fukuoka and Hokkaido, according to Jetro.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
Tuesday [26 April] asked China to upgrade its investment 
environment for foreign businesses. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) made 
the request during its first high-level consultations with 
China's State Economic and Trade Commission, which started 
Monday. 
  The Japanese team to the two-day talks, led by Sozaburo 
Okamatsu, vice MITI minister for international affairs, pointed 
to ambiguous rules by Beijing on labor conditions and sudden 
changes in its administrative rules on foreign business 
activity, such as prohibitions on the receipt of money in 
foreign currencies, a MITI official told a press conference. 
  The Japanese delegation also complained about deteriorating 
living conditions in China for foreign corporate employees, such 
as a sudden hike in rents, for example, to 10,000 dollars per 
month from 8,500 dollars, the MITI official said. 
  The Chinese side, led by Yang Changji, the commission's vice 
minister, promised Beijing will do its utmost to improve the 
situation which was described by the Japanese team as "eroding 
incentive for investment." 
  The Chinese commission explained that China is pushing ahead 
with various reform programs as a way to pave the way for 
China's admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), the MITI official said. 
  Tokyo welcomes the move, hoping for the communist country's 
early entry into GATT, the official said. 
  The State Economic and Trade Commission was created in April 
1993 as the Chinese version of Japan's MITI. 
  The two parties agreed to hold their second round of 
high-level talks in the first half of 1995, the MITI official 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- China has formulated a 
comprehensive automobile industry development policy with 
emphasis on fostering domestic auto parts makers, Japanese 
Government sources said Wednesday [27 April]. 
  The sources in the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] said the 13-chapter policy drafted by China's 
State Planning Commission bars foreign automakers from producing 
vehicles with components shipped from their plants outside China. 
  The sources said the draft aims to develop economical 
passenger car models designed for use by the public, signaling a 
departure from its past policy of emphasizing the development of 
vehicles for office use. 
  In order to promote the development of the domestic 
automobile industry, emphasis will be laid on fostering parts 
manufacturers, they said. 
  Along this policy line, the sources said, the draft policy 
calls for foreign automakers operating in the country to 
maintain the local content ratio or the ratio of locally 
procured parts used in the vehicle at 40-50 percent in the 
initial stage. 
  The complete knockdown formula (CKD) to assemble vehicles 
with most components and parts brought in from outside the 
country will be banned, the sources said. 
  They said the policy paves the way for Japanese automakers 
to 
produce vehicles in China through joint ventures with Chinese 
partners holding a controlling equity of over 50 percent. 
  In view of the local content regulation, the Chinese auto 
market will be open only to foreign automakers engaging in auto 
parts production in advance, the sources said. 
  China is regarded as a potentially huge market for auto 
makers, with domestic demand exceeding 15 million units in the 
year 2000. 
  Under the existing principle, Japanese automakers now 
produce 
only minivehicles and small-sized cars in China while U.S. and 
European rivals engage in producing larger vehicles. 
  Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's top automaker, which is 
interested in producing cars in China will be required to launch 
a joint part manufacturing venture before making full entry into 
the Chinese market, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Japan has urged China not to 
conduct nuclear tests, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said 
Monday [2 May]. 
  Saito told a press conference Japan filed the request with 
the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo. The Japanese Embassy in Beijing 
also made the same request to the Chinese Government. 
  Japan has obtained information that China may soon conduct a 
test, he said. 
  China reiterated its position that it supports complete 
abolishment of nuclear weapons and that the number of China's 
nuclear tests are far fewer than that of other nuclear powers, 
Saito said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- New Home Affairs Minister 
Hajime Ishii says he is eager to allow the several hundreds of 
thousand Japanese citizens living overseas to vote in Japanese 
elections in absentia. 
  "If we are given a year or so, I think we can prepare a 
bill. 
If we cannot resolve the issue, we should be called negligent," 
said Ishii, a senior member of the coalition's core party 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) led by Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata. 
  Some countries, including Australia, Britain, Sweden and the 
United States, grant the right to vote to some of their eligible 
citizens residing overseas and there have been demands from 
Japanese abroad to guarantee such a right. 
  Ishii also said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE that 
he hopes the bills on the locations of 300 new single-seat 
constituencies for the House of Representatives will be enacted 
in the current ordinary Diet session ending June 29. 
  Ishii played a pivotal role in enacting a political reform 
package as the head of the lower house special committee on 
political reform. The bills became law in late January but will 
not take effect until the locations of the constituencies are 
fixed. 
  A government panel studying the locations will present its 
advice in several months, at which time the bills will be drawn 
up by the government. 
  The package centers on changing the 511-member lower house 
electoral system from the current multiseat constituency system 
into a combination of elections from 300 single-seat 
constituencies and the remaining 200 through a proportional 
representation system. 
  Ishii said the next lower house election must be held under 
the new system. "We must not implement a worn-out system again." 
  The minister said he is positive about the introduction of a 
local consumption tax. 
  "It would go against the current trend toward 
decentralization if the central government hoarded financial 
sources," he said. 
  Ishii also said the government is making efforts to draw up 
concrete decentralization guidelines, based on which the 
government would submit bills to the Diet by the end of this 
year. 
  He said Japan's local governments may have to foster 
administrative reform after the central government goes ahead 
with such reform.

<F P=106> [By Ikuji Nakaya] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- With peace talks in progress 
in the Middle East, once-reluctant Japanese businesses are 
beginning to turn to Israel with its high technology and the 
potential of Tel Aviv to become one of the financial centers of 
the region. 
  Both on official and private-sector levels, Japan and Israel 
started exchanging various delegations in late 1992. 
  The historic agreement reached by the Israeli Government and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) last September on 
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank city of Jericho and the 
Gaza Strip accelerated Japanese interest in business with Israel. 
  On Wednesday in Cairo, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and 
Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are scheduled to finalize the 
agreement, inviting dozens of top diplomats including japanese 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. 
  Akio Aoki, managing director of U.S.-based consultant TTT 
Technology Trade Inc., says the so-called Arab Boycott, hitherto 
believed to be the biggest hurdle in doing business with Israel, 
has become in effect "nominal." 
  Aoki, who is head of TTT's Tokyo office, says Japanese firms 
are increasingly showing interest in Israel's high tech, 
especially in areas like medical equipment and biotechnology. 
  TTT has recently agreed on a business tie-up with Nippon 
Investment and Finance Corp., an affiliate of Daiwa Securities 
Co., to provide small and medium-sized Japanese firms with 
information on business opportunities with Israel. 
  Kiyoshi Tsuji, president of electronic equipment trader 
Kaytec Ltd. based in Tokyo, hopes to triple turnover this year. 
The company mainly sells Israeli-made software linked with the 
local area network (LAN) system to major Japanese System 
Integrator (SI) concerns. 
  A Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
official agrees with Aoki that the Arab boycott, under which 
countries and companies could be subject to retaliation for 
doing business with Israel, is losing its power, and trade 
between Japan and Israel is actually increasing. 
  "It is true that the Japanese business industry is 
interested 
in Israel," says Kanji Hayashi, assistant director of the 
Federation of Economic Organizations' (Keidanren) Asian affairs 
department. 
  Keidanren sent a 14-member delegation to the Jewish state 
last year, mainly composed of executives at major trading houses. 
  In addition to Israel's strong ties with the United States, 
Hayashi says, the country can serve as a bridge to European 
nations as well, while being one of the commercial centers of 
the Middle East. 
  Auto manufacturers like Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (MMC) and 
Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. have considerable experience in 
exporting cars to Israel. Other manufacturers like Toyota and 
Nissan recently followed suit. 
  An MMC spokesman said the company exports about 20,000 cars 
per year and the vehicles are sold through local dealerships, 
which the company considers will not be subject to the Arab 
boycott since it is not a direct investment. 
  But, while showing interest in business with Israel, major 
companies, at least superficially, still express caution over 
taking risks in deals with Israel. 
  A spokesman for trading firm Mitsubishi Corp. bluntly said, 
"the Arab boycott has never been canceled," while an Itochu 
Corp. spokesman said the company is merely "in the stage of 
collecting information." 
  A spokesman for NEC Corp., a major electronics maker, 
acknowledged Israel's high technology but was skeptical about 
launching major business relations with Israel. 
  In the financial sector, however, government sources said 
two 
to three brokerage companies, including one or more "Big Four" 
securities firms, are planning to open representative offices in 
Tel Aviv soon for the first time. 
  Daiwa Securities, an affiliate of Nippon Investment and 
Finance, declined to comment on its strategy in Israel. 
  An official with the Japan Securities Dealers Association 
says there is a good possibility that Israel will become a 
financial hub in the future. 
  "We shouldn't be left behind then," he said, but the problem 
is the scanty knowledge Japanese financial institutions have of 
the Middle East, India and Pakistan. "All they think about is 
New York and London," he said. 
  The official said the association is ready to designate the 
Tel Aviv Stock Exchange as a preferred market for Japanese 
investors any time, but so far there has been no request from 
Japanese securities firms nor from foreign brokerage houses in 
Tokyo. 
  Max Livnat, minister of economic affairs at the Embassy of 
Israel in Tokyo, says the country is seeking to attract direct 
investment from Japan in addition to trade of goods. 
  He says it will be great business if Japan can do 
international marketing on products developed by Israeli 
research and development, which is one of the areas that 
Japanese firms are streamlining due to the economic slowdown. 
  "To my surprise, they are still cautious," he said, but he 
believes it is "just a matter of time." 
  Livnat said he is expecting a major reconciliation between 
Israel and the Arabs within this year and perhaps "faster than 
people believe," suggesting Japanese firms should not lose time 
by "being so cautious."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
welcomed Monday [2 May] a likely victory of Nelson Mandela's 
African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa's national 
assembly election Sunday. 
  "I evaluate the nation that took apartheid policy is heading 
for democracy," Hata told a reporters at his official residence. 
  Mandela's ANC headed for victory Sunday with a 53 percent 
share of votes, according to reports from Johannesburg. 
  About one-fifth of the votes had been counted out of an 
estimated 23 million ballots cast in South Africa's historic 
all-race elections, it said. 
  The government is expected to issue an official comment on 
the election later in the day, Japanese officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry and 
the Bank of Japan were shocked Saturday by the yen's sharp rise 
to the 100 yen level to the dollar at one point in New York the 
day before. 
  The Japanese currency recovered to the mid-101 yen level to 
the dollar after concerted interventions by Japanese and U.S. 
monetary authorities, but dealers are anticipating the yen will 
rise again. The dollar temporarily plunged to a record postwar 
low for the New York market of 100.65 yen and ended Friday 
trading at 101.55-65 yen, up 0.25 yen from Thursday's close. 
Dealers said the yen surged on speculation that new Japanese 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's minority government, formed 
Thursday, might not be able to carry out effective economic 
stimulus measures. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii expressed appreciation of 
the 
Japan-U.S. concerted interventions, saying the recent meeting in 
Washington of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the 
Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations agreed that 
excessive exchange fluctuations are not desirable. Fujii said, 
however, that "the exchange market is seeing sharp 
fluctuations," expressing concern about its effects on the 
Japanese economy, which has showed signs of recovery.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- To cope with the yen's 
sharp advance against the U.S. dollar to a record high, Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet is resolved to upgrade 
dollar-buying intervention in the world's currency markets in 
concert with other economic powers, the cabinet's top spokesman 
said Saturday [30 April]. 
  The agreement was made at an emergency meeting of ministers 
in charge of economic issues, held in the evening of the same 
day after the U.S. currency plunged to a record low 100.65 yen 
at one stage in New York on Friday after opening at 100.80 yen, 
lower than the former record of 100.85 yen Aug. 17, 1993. 
  The U.S. currency recovered slightly to end the Friday 
trading at 101.55-65 yen, up from Thursday's late quote of 
101.35-45 yen in the wake of repeated dollar-buying intervention 
by the Federal Reserve Board. 
  The cabinet members concurred that Japan will take 
"appropriate measures at a right time" in a concerted action 
with the Group of Seven (G-7) nations including the United 
States to avoid volatile foreign exchange movements, Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told a news conference after 
the hurriedly called cabinet gathering. 
  The Bank of Japan will step into the world's currency 
markets 
in Hong Kong and Singapore together with New York, Frankfurt and 
London as the Tokyo market opens only Monday and Friday in the 
coming week for national holidays between Tuesday and Thursday, 
a financial industry source said. 
  The source said the intervention volume by the Japanese 
central bank will swell to billions of dollars one day in the 
world's foreign exchanges to fight persistent market speculation 
that Hata's cabinet would fail to take effective and strong 
steps against the yen's surge because of its fragile political 
position as a minority coalition. 
  "The yen's strengthening against the dollar above the 100 
yen 
line will give a hard hit on the economy which began to show 
signs of recovery," the source said. 
  At the emergency cabinet meeting, the ministers also agreed 
on the need to smoothly carry out a record 15.25 trillion yen 
economic stimulus package unveiled in February and seek to pass 
the long- overdue fiscal 1994 national budget through the Diet 
as quickly as possible, Kumagai said. 
  The top cabinet spokesman said the ministers confirmed that 
the government should come up with more concrete measures to 
further open its markets by the end of June on the basis of 
similar steps announced in March. 
  The hastily arranged meeting brought together Hata, 
International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Koshiro 
Ishida, chief of the Management and Coordination Agency, and 
Yoshio Terasawa, head of the Economic Planning Agency. 
  Kumagai also attended the gathering on behalf of Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii, who left Tokyo earlier Saturday to 
attend the annual conference of the Asian Development Bank to be 
held in Nice, France, from Tuesday through Thursday. 
  The ministers shared the view that the government should 
spur 
the nation's sustainable growth led by domestic demand and cope 
with its massive trade surplus, especially with the United 
States, Kumagai said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata on Saturday [30 April] expressed his concern over the yen's 
sharp advance against the U.S. dollar, describing the current 
yen-dollar exchange market as "speculative." 
  The premier made the remarks after the U.S. currency plunged 
against the yen to the record low of 100 yen at one stage in New 
York on Friday. 
  "The yen's drastic movements are undesirable. Foreign 
exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals," he said. 
  Responding to a question about the reasons for the strong 
yen, Hata said, "market players are speculative ahead of a 
series of holidays in Japan. Higher long-term interest rates in 
the United States are also behind the current gain in the value 
of the yen." 
  At their emergency gathering, Hata's cabinet colleagues in 
charge of economic issues earlier agreed on the need to enhance 
dollar- supporting intervention to help the economy continue its 
steady recovery from a long recession.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Monday foreign exchange rates should reflect economic 
fundamentals of each country. The premier made the remarks 
after his brief meeting with Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi 
Mieno, who attended a meeting of top financial officials from 
the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers in Washington late last 
month. 
  "We (Hata and Mieno) discussed economic issues in a wide 
range. Yen and U.S. dollar rates should reflect both countries' 
fundamentals," Hata told a group of reporters. 
  The U.S. dollar moved little with fears of dollar-supporting 
intervention by the Bank of Japan after opening at 101.80 yen in 
Tokyo on Monday, 0.58 yen lower than Friday's quote.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- Japanese Cabinet ministers 
in charge of economic affairs on Saturday agreed on a set of 
measures on Japan's immediate economic management, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. 
  At an emergency meeting to discuss the yen's recent surge 
against the U.S. dollar, the ministers concurred on the need to 
closely watch the developments in foreign currency markets and 
to keep in touch with nations concerned, the top government 
spokesman said. 
  They also agreed on the need to smoothly carry out a record 
15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus package unveiled in 
February and seek to pass the long-overdue fiscal 1994 national 
budget through the Diet as quickly as possible, Kumagai told a 
news conference. 
  The ministers reportedly agreed the government should come 
up 
with more concrete measures to further open its markets by the 
end of June on the basis of similar steps announced in March. 
  They also reaffirmed the need to chart a course for 
comprehensive tax system reform by the end of June and push 
necessary legislation through the Diet by the end of the year, 
he said. 
  The hastily arranged meeting brought together Prime Minister 
Hata, International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, 
Koshiro Ishida, chief of the Management and Coordination Agency, 
Yoshio Terasawa, head of the Economic Planning Agency. 
  Kumagai also attended the gathering on behalf of Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii, who left Tokyo earlier in the day to 
attend the annual conference of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 
to be held in Nice, France, from Tuesday to Thursday. 
  Kumagai said the ministers shared the view that the 
government should spur the nation's sustainable growth led by 
domestic demand and cope with its massive trade surplus, 
especially with the United States. 
  The emergency meeting came on the heels of the yen's sharp 
rise to the 100 yen level to the dollar on overseas markets 
Friday. 
  In New York, the U.S. dollar closed Friday at 101.55-65 yen 
after plunging to a postwar low for the market of 100.65 yen. 
  The yen's recovery to the mid-101 yen level to the dollar 
followed concerted interventions by Japanese and U.S. monetary 
authorities. 
  It was the first time in eight months that the dollar dipped 
to the 100 yen level. The dollar plummeted to a historic low of 
100.40 yen in Tokyo last August. 
  In London, too, the dollar weakened against the yen, falling 
below the 101 yen level in afternoon trading before finishing 
the day at 101.45-55 yen, down 0.40 yen from the previous day's 
late quote.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Kan Kato, head of the 
government's tax reform panel, said Tuesday [26 April] the 
group's basic stance on tax system reforms remains unchanged 
despite the Social Democratic Party's break from the ruling 
coalition. 
  Kato told a news conference after the panel's plenary 
session 
the tax commission is resolved to realize tax reforms centering 
on a boost of indirect taxes. 
  The policy was agreed on when the coalition government was 
formed last August, he said. 
  Taking the country's future into consideration, tax reform 
must be carried out regardless of which government comes into 
power, he said. 
  Kato said reform is also Japan's international obligation 
and 
the commission is required to work out a proposal by the end of 
June, in time for the July summit of major industrialized 
nations in Naples. 
  The body will coordinate its stance with other councils 
concerned with administrative reforms, leading to cuts in 
government expenditures, he said. 
  Kato expressed hope the SDP will support the proposed tax 
system reforms.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata is set to leave for his first overseas trip as premier 
Monday [2 May] to tour Italy, France, Germany and Belgium. 
  Hata will explain to European leaders the political 
developments that led to the breakup of the seven-party 
coalition, government officials said. 
  Hata, who formed a minority government after the coalition's 
biggest party, the Social Democratic Party, defected from the 
alliance, will pledge to continue the reform drive launched by 
his predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa in the field of politics, 
administration and economy. 
  Hosokawa's coalition government ousted the Liberal 
Democratic 
Party (LDP) last August after almost four decades of its 
unchallenged rule. 
  With the annual summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major 
industrialized nations in July drawing close, Hata will also 
elaborate on Japan's efforts to boost world economic growth, 
such as income tax cuts, deregulation, market opening and 
pump-priming measures to stimulate domestic demand, the 
officials said. 
  Foreign Ministry officials, however, expressed concern 
whether Hata will be able to put on a strong performance as it 
is widely believed that his government will be short-lived. 
  The majority opposition could force Hata and his cabinet to 
step down or to dissolve the House of Representatives to call a 
general election as soon as the budget for fiscal 1994, which 
started April 1, has been adopted by the Diet. 
  He might want to ask for some advice in Italy, the first leg 
of his trip and host of the Naples summit, where the average 
lifespan of postwar cabinets has not exceeded 309 days, with the 
power vacuum between the formation of cabinets averaging some 33 
days. 
  In Rome, Hata, traveling in the company of his wife Yasuko 
and Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kitamura, is scheduled 
to hold talks with both outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio 
Ciampi and incoming Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose 
rightist Freedom Alliance won a landslide victory in March 
general elections. 
  The agenda in Paris, where Hata will meet President Francois 
Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, will include 
Japanese-French cooperation in Indochina and Africa, the 
officials said. 
  In Bonn, Hata will reconfirm in talks with Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl that Japan and Germany will join forces in their bid for a 
permanent seat on a revised U.N. Security Council. 
  They will also likely formally launch a Japanese-German 
cooperation council on high technology and environment 
technology, proposed during Kohl's visit to Japan in March last 
year, which is to sound out areas for joint research and 
development. 
  Before returning to Japan on May 7, Hata is scheduled to 
meet 
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene and the president of the 
European commission, Jacques Delors, in Brussels.

  [Excerpts] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Less than a week into his 
term as Japan's new prime minister, Tsutomu Hata left Tokyo on 
Monday [2 May] for an official visit to Italy, France, Germany 
and Belgium. 
  Hata aims to establish personal rapport with European 
leaders 
ahead of the July summit in Naples, Italy, of the Group of Seven 
(G- 7) major industrialized nations, Foreign Ministry officials 
said. 
  The visit should also serve to strengthen political ties 
between Japan and the European Union, they said. 
  The trip was originally scheduled for January by then Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, but was postponed until May due to 
tight domestic political schedules. [passage omitted on 
previously filed material] 
  It is extremely rare for a Japanese premier to leave the 
country so early into his term -- a mere five days in Hata's 
case. 
  Hata, who was elected prime minister by the Diet on April 
25, 
inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday following the withdrawal 
of a key coalition ally, the Social Democratic Party.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Calling his new government an administration which 
will succeed the previous administration's effort to realize 
reforms, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, in his policy speech to be 
delivered at both the House of Representatives and the House of 
Councilors on 10 May, plans to disclose his idea that he will 
deal with the pending tasks, including tax system reform, in 
line with the platform agreed when the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] was still in the coalition. 
  Calling his government an administration to succeed reform 
effort, the Prime Minister in his policy speech plans to 
emphasize the stance that his administration will continue to 
promote political, economic, and administrative reforms, which 
the Hosokawa administration tried to realize. 
  Regarding the tax system reform, which is a focal point of 
the reforms, he plans to explain that he will make a drastic 
change, centered around reduction of indirect taxes, on the 
basis of the coalition platform which the SDPJ and the ruling 
coalition parties agreed. 
  Moreover, on ways to deal with North Korea's suspected 
nuclear arms development, Hata will announce that his government 
will act in line with the platform. He will explain a plan that 
in addition to cooperation with the United States and the ROK, 
his government will act in concert with China if necessary. 
  On the issue of becoming a permanent member of the UN 
Security Council, Hata will indirectly express his desire by 
using expressions similar to the ones the Japanese Government 
used last July. The Japanese Government said last July that 
Japan was ready to fulfill all responsibilities it could 
possibly fulfill in the Security Council. 
  It seems that Prime Minister Hata decided to explain the 
stance of not reflecting Shinseito's [Japan Renewal Party's] 
individuality in his policy speech because he aims to 
continuously ask the SDPJ to come back to the minority coalition 
government.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Two former executive 
officials of major contractor Obayashi Corp. pleaded guilty 
Monday [25 April] to a charge that they sent a 10 million yen 
bribe in 1992 to then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii, in connection 
with a municipal public works project. 
  Ishii, 68, denied taking any money from Obayashi and pleaded 
innocence. 
  Ishii's accomplice Mitsuo Moriya, 66, who was his one-time 
aide and charged with conspiring with the mayor to accept the 
bribe on Ishii's behalf, said he took delivery of the money but 
denied a prosecution contention that it was a bribe and that the 
two conspired to take it. 
  Ishii, Moriya and the two businessmen entered separate pleas 
at their first trial session at the Tokyo District Court on 
Monday. 
  It is the last in a series of trials on alleged payments to 
local government officials by major construction contractors. 
  The two Obayashi executives are Koreaki Hagiwara, 66, former 
vice president of Obayashi, Japan's fourth largest construction 
firm based in Osaka, and Juichi Konishi, 59, former head of the 
builder's Tohoku branch in Sendai. 
  The two are charged with giving the 10 million yen bribe to 
Ishii on Oct. 7, 1992. 
  Hagiwara and Konishi told the court they gave Ishii the 
money 
to help his mayoral election campaign, accepting a prosecution 
argument their action constituted bribery. 
  Ishii, who resigned as mayor after his arrest last year, is 
also on trial on charges of receiving bribes from several other 
major contractors in similar attempts to get orders for public 
works projects in Sendai. 
  A series of bribery scandals has implicated eight 
contractors 
-- Hazama Corp., Shimizu Corp., Nishimatsu Construction Co., 
Mitsui Construction Co., Taisei Corp., Kajima Corp., Obayashi 
Corp. and Tobishima Corp. as well as Daishowa Paper Mfg. Co. 
  In the series, 31 people, including two governors, two 
mayors 
and more 20 executives of construction companies have been 
indicted. 
  The only remaining trial related to alleged bribery by major 
contractors is that of former Construction Minister Kishiro 
Nakamura expected some time between late June and early July.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Shigeru Goda will resign 
as chairman of Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. this week to take 
responsibility for the company's involvement in a payoff 
scandal, company officials said Tuesday [26 April]. 
  Goda will step down and take up new duties as an adviser 
effective Thursday, the officials said. 
  They said Goda will consider whether to resign as head of 
the 
Japan Shipbuilders Association. 
  Mitoshi Ozawa will continue to serve as president of the 
company, the officials said. 
  A former executive of the company was arrested last February 
on suspicion of offering 10 million yen in bribes to a city 
assembly member in Tsukuga, Ibaraki Prefecture, in a bid to win 
an order for construction of a waste disposal facility. 
  The company also was reported to have offered bribes to 
local 
government officials in Niihama, Ehime Prefecture, and Gojo, 
Nara Prefecture, in connection with the construction of waste 
disposal and water treatment facilities.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 30 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei 
Kono urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Saturday to resign his 
post as soon as the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), made 
the appeal in an NHK television talk show videotaped Saturday to 
be aired Sunday. Kono said the country's two largest political 
parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), have not 
participated in Hata's minority government, which is made up 
only of smaller parties. 
  He said the danger facing Hata is that his cabinet revolves 
around just one or two people who represent and manipulate all 
the parties in it, in an allusion to the coalition's two key 
strategists -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa. "The 
Hata administration will have nothing to do after the budget is 
passed by the Diet and we will seek it to hand over power at 
that stage," Kono said. 
  Debates on the budget up for parliamentary approval have 
been 
stalled during the transfer of power to Hata from his 
predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, who stepped down earlier this 
month due to a scandal over his personal finances. 
  Kono said the LDP wants the next general election to be held 
under a new system combining single-seat and proportional 
representation formulas. He said he has in his mind the 
presentation of a no-confidence motion against the Hata cabinet 
to the Diet to force it to resign en masse. He indicated the LDP 
will promote collaboration with the SDP, which broke away from 
the ruling coalition Tuesday over a dispute with other alliance 
parties.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2258 GMT on 30 April, during its "News 2001" 
program, broadcasts a live 26-minute panel discussion with 
newly-appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai. The 
discussion is moderated by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and 
Tomomi Seki; political commentator Kenichi Takemura and Keio 
University Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi also participate. 
  Kuroiwa first asks how Kumagai views the received opinion 
that the Hata cabinet will be short-lived. Kumagai says people 
tend to express sympathy, rather than congratulations, to him 
for assuming the post of the chief government spokesman, when 
they believe that current political conditions are the worst 
ever. However, he says: "I am resolved to work to extract 
politics from worst-case scenarios." 
  When asked what the top priority task for the new government 
is, Kumagai mentions political reform and stresses the 
importance of continuing reform efforts. He says: "I believe 
completing political reform is the most important task for Prime 
Minister Hata." He adds: "Finally, administrative and economic 
reforms have also started. Reform is not merely a word on 
everybody's lips, but is something to be achieved for Japan to 
continue to exist." 
  Next, Kuroiwa asks for Kumagai's comments on people's 
criticism that the new cabinet lineup was decided on only by 
Hata, Kumagai, and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Chief 
Secretary Ichiro Ozawa. Kumagai denies the allegation, saying 
that Prime Minister Hata heard the opinions of many other people 
before forming the new cabinet. He then says it was inevitable 
for Hata to give many cabinet posts to Shinseito and Komeito 
[Clean Government Party] since the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ], the largest among the ruling parties, has left the 
ruling coalition. 
  Next, they discuss the issue of summoning to the Diet former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's secretaries as witnesses to 
investigate the scandal involving Hosokawa's receipt of a loan 
from a private company. Kumagai says he thinks Hosokawa has 
already assumed political responsibility for the stalled Diet 
business caused by prolonged arguments over his loan, noting: 
"It is not a matter for the Hata cabinet to decide how the issue 
should be handled." But he predicts that Hosokawa's former 
secretaries may be summoned to the Diet. 
  They turn to the issue of worsening trade ties with the 
United States. Takemura says if the new government can ease 
trade friction between the two countries over the next two 
months, it will be a great achievement. Also, while showing the 
results of his survey of Diet members on an indirect tax hike, 
Professor Kobayashi says it is very important for Japan to 
decide whether to implement the tax hike and bring the decision 
to a Japan-U.S. summit meeting to be held immediately before the 
Naples summit in July. The survey shows that 48 percent of Diet 
members questioned support the tax hike, while 25.4 percent 
oppose it. After hearing this, Kumagai notes that the coalition 
platform agreed upon by the ruling parties and the SDPJ includes 
a plan to implement the tax hike, saying: "In the process of 
working out specific measures to implement the hike, we will 
tenaciously work to persuade the SDPJ to return to the coalition 
to carry out the policy platform with us." 
  Turning to the DPRK nuclear issue, Kuroiwa notes it is 
highly 
possible that if the United Nations Security Council [UNSC] 
fails to adopt a resolution, Washington will independently 
decide on economic sanctions against North Korea and ask Japan 
and South Korea to participate as well. Kuroiwa then asks 
Kumagai how Japan will respond to the U.S. call. Kumagai first 
expresses the hope that the worst-case scenario be avoided in 
dealing with the DPRK nuclear issue. He then stresses that 
since negotiations between North Korea and the international 
community to resolve the issue are in progress, he would like to 
refrain from commenting on this issue. He says: "Because I am a 
government official, I cannot comment on this at present. Also, 
I cannot comment because we are now closely watching how 
Pyongyang will respond [to the UNSC statement calling on the 
DPRK to accept full inspections], which is due in early May." 
  Asked about the flagging economy, Kumagai says: "Frankly 
speaking, I think it will take some time before we feel that the 
economy is picking up, since the after-effects of the bursting 
of the bubble economy still exist. But I believe the economy 
has passed through its worst stage." 
  Concerning a possible alliance with the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP], Kumagai says: "It may be possible for the 
coalition to establish a grand union with the LDP if both sides 
can agree on policies." But he stresses the importance of 
forming an alliance with the SDPJ first, saying: "We have to 
think about the SDPJ first. Because of our mistake, the party 
had to leave the coalition. So, we will keep our door open to 
them." 
  Noting that the enactment of bills on new constituency 
boundaries for the House of Representatives is necessary to hold 
the next general election under the new electoral system, which 
is a combination of single seat constituencies and proportional 
representation, Kobayashi asks Kumagai when he think these bills 
will be enacted. Kumagai says: "It may be difficult to have 
them passed before the end of May. At any rate, the coalition 
platform says that the bills should be enacted before the end of 
the current Diet session." 
  In the end, Kumagai says that while emphasizing cooperation, 
the Hata cabinet will continue to uphold the torch of reform.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "NHK News 7" program] </F>
  [Text] Speaking with reporters today, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said the Hata cabinet will continue to 
pursue reformist policies which the Hosokawa government 
initiated and seek cooperation from the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] which jointly ran the previous government in 
implementing those reformist policies. 
  [Begin Kumagai recording] Prime Minister Hata was involved 
in working out those reformist policies as deputy prime 
minister. I believe that the Hata government will inherit and 
develop the reformist policies which the Hosokawa government 
worked out. [end recording]. 
  While speaking with the reporters, the chief cabinet 
secretary also stressed that the Hata government will promote 
political reform which still leaves the issue of drafting a bill 
on the demarcation of single-seat constituencies unresolved, 
economic reform to relax bureaucratic deregulations, and 
administrative reform to precipitate decentralization. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai commented on the discussion 
of ways to reform the current tax system by ruling coalition 
parties in a recent interview with the NHK and said as follows: 
  [Begin Kumagai recording] In the past, the SDPJ participated 
in the discussion. With the SDPJ breaking away from the 
coalition, however, the discussion is making little headway. 
Some are asserting that the discussion should be held without 
the SDPJ. It is important to promote reform of the current tax 
system in a way that we lure the SDPJ back to the coalition, but 
I believe that the SDPJ will absolutely not come bask to the 
coalition. Therefore, we will have to make substantive efforts 
to make the SDPJ come back to the coalition. [end recording]. 
  In this way, Mr. Kumagai indicated that as a minority 
government, the Hata government will carry out the reformist 
policies while giving consideration to the SDPJ. 
  With regard to the issue of Japan's participation in the 
collective self-defense set by the UN Charter, the government 
has so far taken the view that Japan's participation in the 
collective self-defense is tantamount to exercising the right of 
collective self-defense and that violates the Constitution. In 
this connection, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai said the Hata 
cabinet does need to alter the view. Thus, he made it clear that 
the Hata cabinet does not intend to put into effect the idea of 
changing the interpretation of the Constitution that has been 
broached by Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party].

  [Text] Tokyo, May 1 KYODO -- The new cabinet of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata posted a 51.6 percent public approval 
rating, down 24.1 percentage points from last August's 
inauguration of the cabinet of his predecessor, Morihiro 
Hosokawa, a KYODO NEWS SERVICE public opinion poll showed Sunday 
[1 May]. 
  The support for Hata's cabinet also represented a 3.5 
percentage point decline from the 1991 inauguration of the 
cabinet of then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  KYODO's telephone poll of 1,000 voters also showed that 31.3 
percent disapproved of the Hata cabinet while the remaining 17.1 
percent gave no clear answer. 
  A YOMIURI SHIMBUN survey published Sunday put the cabinet 
approval rating at 58.0 percent. 
  KYODO conducted the survey Friday and Saturday covering 486 
men and 513 women aged 20 or older and picked at random 
throughout the country. 
  Hata, head of the ruling coalition's core party Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], was elected prime minister last Monday 
and inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday after the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) quit the coalition. 
  The poll also said 37.4 percent supported the SDP's 
departure 
from the coalition, compared with 20.7 percent who would like to 
see the SDP rejoin the coalition, 41.1 percent who neither 
supported nor disapproved of the SDP's departure, and 0.8 
percent who gave no clear answer. 
  Asked why the pollees supported the Hata cabinet, an 
overwhelming 48.3 percent replied that there is no other 
appropriate candidate, compared with 18.0 percent who showed 
trust in the new prime minister and 17.1 percent who expressed 
positive expectations of reforms. 
  Among the nonsupporters, 58.1 percent replied that Hata is 
under excessive influence by key coalition strategist Ichiro 
Ozawa, cofounder and secretary general of Shinseito. 
  The poll showed 18.5 percent of the nonsupporters view 
Hata's 
minority cabinet as unstable, 12.5 percent replied they cannot 
count on the cabinet's policies and 7.0 percent indicated 
concern with the exclusion of Japan's two largest political 
parties -- the LDP and the SDP. 
  Asked to pick the most important policy item for the Hata 
cabinet, 44.4 percent of the pollees cited economic 
pump-priming, followed by 18.4 percent for tax reform, 16.7 
percent for political reform, 5.5 percent for deregulation, 5.0 
percent for national security, and 4.7 percent for improvement 
of Japan-U.S. relations. 
  The poll said 39.8 percent predicted the Hata cabinet to 
last 
about half a year, while 29.3 percent indicated one year, 20.9 
percent said two or three months, and 6.1 percent predicted two 
years or longer. 
  Those approving of the inauguration of the minority 
government reached 32.1 percent, while 32.9 percent expressed 
concern, and 33.7 percent expressed neither approval nor concern. 
  Of those who expressed concern, 71.4 percent called for an 
early dissolution of the House of Representatives for a snap 
general election, 21.3 percent proposed soliciting members of 
the LDP and SDP to form a majority ruling force, and 3.3 percent 
urged the Hata cabinet to resign en masse. 
  The LDP, the largest opposition party, was the most popular 
among the respondents garnering support of 17.2 percent, down 
from 18.3 percent in February. 
  Hata's Shinseito ranked second at 12.2 percent, up from 6.4 
percent, the SDP ranked third at 11.2 percent, up from 9.2 
percent. 
  Komeito, a coalition party backed by the country's biggest 
Buddhist lay organization Soka Gakkai, garnered support of 4.4 
percent, up from 3.3 percent, and new party Sakigake rose to 2.9 
percent from 2.1 percent. 
  Hosokawa's Japan New Party, which enjoyed booming popular 
support in last July's general election, suffered a crushing 
setback as voter support dropped to 2.1 percent from 8.2 percent. 
  Last month, three members left the JNP because of 
differences 
with the party leadership over the party's approach to Shinseito. 
  The number of voters who do not support any particular party 
remained unchanged at 42.3 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 1 KYODO -- About 3.7 million workers 
took part in annual May Day events Sunday [1 May] in 1,200 
locations nationwide to demand better working conditions and 
more jobs. 
  As in past years, labor unions affiliated with the Japanese 
trade union confederation (Rengo) and anti-Rengo union forces 
held separate gatherings. 
  At Yoyogi Park, near the Imperial Palace in central Tokyo, 
about 250,000 people attended a rally sponsored by Rengo, 
Japan's largest labor group. 
  Besides Rengo leader Akira Yamagishi, coalition government 
leaders and Social Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, 
whose party last week seceded from the government, were present 
at the gathering. 
  Yamagishi called for more solidarity among the 8 
million-strong Rengo workers to protect their organizations in 
dealing with complex political situations resulting from the 
first minority government since 1955. 
  From the coalition government, Labor Minister Kunio 
Hatoyama, 
director general of the Management and Coordination Agency 
Koshiro Ishida, who is also Komeito [Clean Government Party] 
chairman, delivered May Day addresses at the rally. 
  Rengo had planned to invite Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata as 
the head of the new government launched on April 28 but gave up 
the plan because the SDP now became an opposition by leaving the 
regime. 
  In Kameido Chuo Park in Tokyo, members of unions in the 
National Confederation of Trade Unions, which has close links 
with the Japanese Communist Party, held a separate rally.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Sales at Japan's large 
retailers dropped 3.0 percent in March from a year before to 
1,759.5 billion yen, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) said Wednesday [27 April]. 
  It was the 22nd straight month for sales at major retailers 
to decline from year-earlier levels, the ministry said in a 
preliminary report. 
  MITI said the poor performance in the reporting month 
reflected continued price-consciousness among consumers. 
  A spell of bad weather in the latter half of March also 
adversely affected retail sales, MITI said. 
  Sales at 420 department stores fell 4.2 percent to 940 
billion yen, marking the 25th straight month of year-to-year 
declines, it said. 
  Sales at 2,056 supermarket chains dipped 1.5 percent from a 
year earlier to 819.6 billion yen, for the 20th straight month 
of falls. 
  March sales of clothing at department stores decreased 5.3 
percent from a year before while clothing sales at supermarket 
chains fell 6.4 percent. 
  Total clothing sales for the reporting month dropped 5.6 
percent for the 20th month running of year-to-year declines. 
  Sales of spring clothing were sluggish due to unusually cool 
weather in the month, while sales of business suits continued to 
fare poorly, MITI said. 
  Sales of food and beverages edged up 0.4 percent overall, 
with a 0.2 percent pickup at department stores and a 0.5 percent 
gain at supermarket chains. 
  Food and beverage sales grew for the third month in a row on 
brisk demand for products for daily use. 
  Sales of small items of furniture picked up but high-priced 
furniture performed poorly. 
  General household equipment sales were slack. 
  Sales of household electrical appliances grew 8.1 percent at 
supermarket chains but fell 6.5 percent at department stores.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Retail prices of 
government- controlled rice took a steep downturn in March with 
large amounts of inexpensive imported rice on sale, a government 
report said Wednesday [27 April]. 
  Medium to short grains, such as Chinese and California rice, 
were priced on average at 4,100 to 4,300 yen per 10 kilograms, 
about 2,000 yen less than the average 6,365 yen that top quality 
domestic rice fetched the previous month. 
  Thai rice, at about 3,000 yen per 10 kilos, sold for less 
than half the February price for domestic rice, while prices for 
foreign rice blended with Japanese rice stood at 4,300 to 5,200 
yen, 1,000 to 2,000 yen lower. 
  Meanwhile, prices of domestically-grown rice being traded 
outside government-approved channels kept sliding as sufficient 
supplies of imported rice have eased consumer worries about the 
availability of the staple grain, market sources said. 
  For instance, wholesale prices for the popular koshihikari 
brand of rice grown in the central areas of Niigata Prefecture 
have recently dropped below the 50,000 yen line per 60 kilogram 
sack for the first time in two years. 
  The downfall in domestic rice prices has led some analysts 
to 
declare that the price run-up seen after last year's poor 
harvests and massive hoarding by consumers has finally come to 
an end. 
  Rice Databank Inc., a research firm specializing in rice, 
said producers and wholesalers, believing that black market rice 
prices have peaked, are in a hurry to unleash their stocks onto 
the market. 
  As an example, a Kansai-based dealer on the black market 
said 
he wants to sell his stocks by August, when early-harvested rice 
will start to appear on the market.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 30 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR] 
guerrillas killed a Buddhist monk, two nuns and an elderly man, 
as well as injured several other monks, when they attacked a 
peace march in northwest Cambodia, a police officer said 
Saturday. 
  The guerrillas opened fire with automatic weapons and 
rocket-propelled grenades as the marchers were being escorted by 
government troops in northwest Battambang's Bavel district, said 
Mek Dara, the deputy police commissioner for Cambodia's second 
city of Battambang. 
  Kol Sarul, one of the three injured monks who was brought to 
Battambang hospital, told AFP that the Khmer Rouge "came from 
everywhere." 
  "The army of Pol Pot then stole all our money and medicine," 
he said. 
  Up to 12 foreigners walking with the monks might have been 
taken hostage during the attack, a spokeswoman for the march, 
Kong Nary, said in the Cambodian capital. Police in Battambang 
could not immediately confirm the report. The marchers were 
being led by Nobel peace prize nominee Maha Ghosananda. 
  "How can the Khmer Rouge dare attack Buddhist monks like 
that? When will our country ever have peace," Kong Nary said. 
"When they attack the Dhammayietra (peace walk), it's just like 
they attack our nation."

  [Text] BAVEL, Cambodia, May 1 (AFP) -- Foreigners taking 
part in a peace march which was attacked by Khmer Rouge [KR] 
guerrillas in northwest Cambodia were briefly detained by the 
guerrillas and then released safe and unharmed, one of the 
foreigners said Sunday. A group of six foreigners was detained 
by the guerrillas along with Cambodian marchers for several 
hours Saturday, Liz Bernstien said. 
  The group was marched into the forest where they met a 
guerrilla commander who later said they were free to go and told 
a Cambodian marcher to guide them back to the peacewalk. 
  The Khmer Rouge stole cameras watches and other valuables 
but 
released the group unharmed, she said. 
  Earlier Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk expressed sorrow 
and 
outrage over the Khmer Rouge attack on the march which left 
three Buddhists dead as well as the foreigners and others 
missing. 
  "I would like to express my condolences and sorrow to Maha 
Ghosananda, the monks, laymen, compatriots and foreign 
friends...who sacrificed to serve the ideals of peace, national 
reconciliation, non-violence, and friendship through the 
peaceful ways of our Lord Buddha," the king said in a statement. 
  A spokesperson for the march, known as the "Dhammayietra 
Walk 
for Peace" and organised by Cambodian spiritual leader Maha 
Ghosananda, said one Buddhist monk, a nun and a layman were 
killed and at least three other monks were injured in the 
attack. Police in Battambang however reported that four people 
had died in the attack. 
  King Sihanouk advised that the peace march be cancelled to 
avoid "other accidents which could...happen again." 
  The marchers were attacked by Khmer Rouge guerrillas late 
Saturday near Bavel district in Battambang province, the police 
said. They were being escorted by government soldiers when the 
guerrillas attacked with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled 
grenades, a police officer in Battambang said. 
  An injured monk, one of three brought to Battambang 
hospital, 
told AFP that many people ran into the forest when the 
guerrillas attacked. The guerrillas then robbed the marchers of 
valuables, march spokeswoman Nou Sambo said. 
  King Sihanouk said in the statement that the Khmer Rouge 
were 
"responsible for this sad and tragic act," and asked them to 
"cease their violent ways." 
  Some 1,000 marchers set out on 400 kilometer (250 mile) walk 
from Battambang on April 24. Their route was to take them along 
National Route 10 to the Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin, and 
then on to the heavily mined and strife-torn regions of 
northwestern Cambodia before ending at the temples of Angkor 
Wat. But Maha Ghosananda decided to change the course Saturday 
after heavy fighting between the government and Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas blocked the march's progress along Route 10 and after 
the radical faction refused to give a guarantee of safe passage. 
Another spokeswoman for the march expressed her indignation at 
the attack. 
  "How can the Khmer Rouge dare attack Buddhist monks like 
that? When will our country ever have peace?," Kong Nary said 
late Saturday. "When they attack the Dhammayietra, it's just 
like they attack the nation," she said. 
  Maha Ghosananda, who has been labelled the "Gandhi of 
Cambodia" and has been nominated for a Nobel peace prize, led 
two previous walks through the militarily volatile provinces to 
call for peace in Cambodia, one in 1991 and the other in the 
run-up to the May 1993 UN-organised elections. 
  Bernstein, an American who lives here and works with Maha 
Ghosananda, said the guerrillas opened fire on two government 
soldiers who were walking in front of the peace march near 
Kompong Pouy about 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Battambang. 
A monk and a nun were shot dead and six other people, including 
four monks, were injured, Bernstein said. Other monks pleaded 
with the government soldiers not to fire back. 
  A guerrilla leader later apologised and said his men didn't 
intend to kill the monk and nun. 
  Around six other foreigners were on the march but were 
further behind and were not stopped by the guerrillas.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "The Khmer Rouge's Game"] </F>
  [Text] People still well remember that on 22 April 1994, 
Khieu Samphan, head of the party of Democratic Kampuchea 
[PDK]-Khmer Rouge [KR], sent a letter to His Majesty King 
Norodom Sihanouk Varaman stressing that, in line with the 
profound aspiration of our entire nation and people, the PDK 
would like to express full support for the proposal, the product 
of His Majesty's profound insight, to organize a roundtable 
meeting for peace and national reconciliation. 
  But hardly had the ink on this letter dried up than Khieu 
Samphan sent another lengthy and detailed letter to the king 
expressing concern over security for himself and his delegation 
during their trip to Phnom Penh to attend the roundtable meeting 
under the king's chairmanship, to be held in the Royal Palace 
from 2 to 7 May. 
  On 27 April, the British REUTER news agency excerpted the 
statement of a Khmer Rouge representative [words indistinct], in 
which he said shamelessly that the Khmer Rouge would seize 
Sisophon and Poipet next month. This man stressed further that 
the Khmer Rouge would start moving to gradually seize positions 
until they had total control of Poipet and Sisophon. 
  The above cases clearly attest that the Khmer Rouge have 
continued to play their old trick of catching a fish with two 
hands [words indistinct] won over the republic regime of Lon Nol 
in 1975. This game is played by holding negotiations while 
launching attacks or holding negotiations in order to launch 
attacks; and by holding negotiations in order to postpone any 
solution and to facilitate attacks aimed at seizing as many 
positions as possible. (?In other words), they have striven to 
attack in order to bargain on the negotiating table. This is 
why, although the Royal Government has made many concessions, 
the Khmer Rouge have stubbornly sought one pretext after another 
in order to prolong the solution to the problem and enable them 
to sell logs and gems and gain money to buy weapons for storage 
to serve their guerrilla war. However, after His Majesty the 
King issued a statement on 22 April calling for a roundtable 
meeting, whether they liked it or not, the Khmer Rouge pretended 
to support this idea. Later, they have sought pretexts to foil 
the roundtable meeting, or at least to delay it or move it from 
one place to another. 
  The main pretext raised by the Khmer Rouge is the so-called 
issue of their personal security [words indistinct]. In fact, 
it is widely known that Khieu Samphan's security can not be the 
cause. This is because the security of the Khmer Rouge 
representative in Phnom Penh is fully guaranteed. 
  On the night of 25 April, His Excellency Ek Sereivoat said 
that the security for Khieu Samphan has been arranged very 
thoroughly: that is, as soon as he comes out of the plane, he 
will get into a car. The well-wishers, including journalists 
will not be allowed to get near him. 
  Observers of Cambodia have also pointed out that Khieu 
Samphan has raised the issue of security in order to avoid 
coming to attend the roundtable, scheduled to be held from 2 to 
7 May. In fact, this is just a pretext. 
  Our people wonder why if the Khmer Rouge are patriots and 
really want to solve the Cambodian problem through political 
means, have they hesitated to come to Phnom Penh? Since they 
dare not come even to attend the roundtable, what can they do? 
If the roundtable meeting is held somewhere other than Phnom 
Penh; and if through that meeting, the Khmer Rouge are given 
some posts in the Royal Government, will they dare to come to 
work in Phnom Penh? Do the Khmer Rouge know how to carry out 
the role of officials only in the jungle? And must their 
meetings be held only in foreign countries? 
  Due to all these matters, our people are not very optimistic 
about this roundtable meeting. And even if the meeting is 
successful, the implementation of the spirit of this roundtable 
meeting cannot be guaranteed. This is because everyone knows 
very well that so far the Khmer Rouge have never respected 
anything, such as the Paris agreement, that they have signed. 
  Our people persistently ask everyone to stop playing the 
Khmer Rouge's game.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 30 Apr (AKP) -- Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, respectively first and second 
prime ministers, have indicated that the roundtable meeting to 
take place from 2 to 7 May cannot be postponed as has been 
proposed by the nominal Khmer Rouge Leader Khieu Samphan. 
  At an audience on Friday, 29 April, with a French delegation 
led by Francois Fillon, minister for higher education and 
research, the two government leaders also underlined that in the 
event of the failure of the roundtable meeting, the government 
should submit a draft law outlawing the Khmer Rouge for the 
National Assembly's adoption. 
  In a message addressed to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk on 27 
April, Khieu Samphan asked for "a neutral place" due to the 
country's security problem and "an appropriate date." 
  "The Khmer Rouge are not able, no matter what, to occupy a 
region totally," reaffirmed the Cambodian prime ministers, 
adding that the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] has mapped 
out "a complete plan" to defend security and the country. 
  Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen appealed to foreign investors 
not to worry about security problem and pointed out that the RGC 
has legislations to guarantee their interests in Cambodia.

  [Text] To His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, 
Royal Palace, Phnom Penh: 
  Your Majesty, I would like to express my most profound 
thanks 
to Your Majesty for sending me another message dated 30 April 
1994. Like your previous messages, this one clearly shows your 
constant consideration for the destiny of our country and the 
Cambodian race in your role as the father of peace and national 
reconciliation who wants to hold a roundtable meeting to achieve 
national reconciliation and peace quickly. 
  In accord with the constant position of the Party of 
Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], all of us -- to the best of our 
ability -- have always studied and thought about how to assist, 
support, and fulfill Your Majesty's national reconciliation 
initiative. This responds to the profound aspirations of the 
Cambodian nation and of every Cambodian. 
  For reasons Your Majesty is already well aware of, though, I 
am of the opinion that under current circumstances, in order to 
ensure security and provide equal status to all sides attending 
the roundtable meeting, the meeting should be held in one of the 
places Your Majesty suggested in your second formula or another 
neutral place. 
  Your Majesty is already aware that Phnom Penh is not safe 
for 
the PDK delegation and is also not a neutral venue. 
  Please forgive any improprieties. 
  [Signed] PDK Chairman Khieu Samphan 
  [Dated] 1 May 1994

  [Text] I. Reliable sources say that ever since the 
communist Vietnamese, their allies, and the puppets of the 
communist Vietnamese and the United States were successively 
defeated, first on the Anlung Veng battlefield and then on the 
Pailin battlefield -- during which their troops and military 
materiel were strategically destroyed -- the communist 
Vietnamese, their allies, the puppets of the communist 
Vietnamese and the United States, and the two-headed government 
have not been able to recruit any new soldiers. They have also 
failed to mobilize old soldiers. 
  II. Thus they have grown angry and are gasping for air. 
They have shown their nature as aggressors, territorial 
expansionists, exterminators of the Cambodian race, and foreign 
lackeys. They have begged the communist Vietnamese to send 
communist Vietnamese aggressors to intervene in Battambang. 
Twenty truckloads of Vietnamese aggressor troops have been 
dispatched to Battambang to help get their wretched troops out 
of trouble. 
  III. The Cambodian nation and people and the National Army 
of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] -- who absolutely adhere to King 
Norodom Sihanouk's national reconciliation and peace plans -- 
are uniting to thwart the dirty and deceitful plan of the 
communist Vietnamese, their allies, and the two types of puppets 
of the communist Vietnamese and the United States, who are 
begging the communist Vietnamese to dispatch troops to help the 
traitors and Vietnamese aggressor lackeys who have sold out the 
nation.

these people and will struggle against them. We are willing to 
fight until we deal their final plan further serious defeats.

visited some economic and cultural bases in Hanoi and Ho Chi 
Minh City.

<F P=106> ["Feature" by Vansai Tavi-gnan: "Cooperate Appropriately </F>
and Effectively in Foreign Investment"] 
  [Text] Respected listeners: Our party and state have 
developed directions, plans, and policies to broaden economic 
cooperation and relations with foreign countries. It is a 
strategic program aimed at bringing about prosperity for our 
multiethnic people as well as building and developing the 
country. With the implementation of this line over the past 
five to six years, our country has ushered in an era of 
switching to the state-regulated market economy mechanism. With 
this mechanism, we have advanced toward the achievement of an 
economic and cultural structure intended to produce a large 
quantity of goods in order to create conditions for an 
accumulation of funds to develop the country. 
  The existing line and the law on the management of foreign 
investment have created favorable conditions to attract and 
encourage more and more foreigners to invest in Laos. Over the 
past five to six years, domestic and foreign businessmen have 
been allowed to invest in more than 350 projects in our country. 
During the first part of this year alone, the Planning and 
Cooperation Committee has given permission for foreign 
businessmen to invest in a total of 43 projects in our country 
worth $116 million. Of these, 27 projects have a total cost of 
less than $1 million, 13 projects have a total cost of $1-5 
million, and three projects have a total cost of more than $5 
million. Total investment has doubled compared to last year; 
last year it was $50 million. It has increased almost four 
times over the first year in which foreign businessmen were 
allowed to invest in our country. Investments by foreign 
businessmen in our country are mainly in the agricultural, 
forestry, industrial, and handicrafts fields. They have also 
invested in the services, such as in tourism, hotels, and banks. 
Most investors in our country come from Thailand, followed by 
China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. 
  To make foreign management and investment efficient and to 
provide legal guarantees for the just interests of each side, in 
early March the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] National 
Assembly endorsed a law on the promotion and management of 
foreign investment in Laos. It was an amendment of the old law 
on foreign investment, making it more suitable and in conformity 
with the current new conditions regarding economic relations and 
cooperation with foreign countries. In addition, to increase 
investor confidence, the general provisions in Article Three, 
Chapter One of the new law on the promotion and management of 
foreign investment stipulate that foreign assets and investment 
in Laos be fully protected by the laws and regulations of the 
LPDR. They may not be requisitioned, confiscated, or 
nationalized by the state unless it is necessary to use them in 
the public's interest. In that case, foreign investors will be 
compensated promptly in a rational and honest manner. All of 
this shows that our party and state are pleased to cooperate 
with all countries that have the good intentions to achieve 
mutual benefit and respect each other's laws. 
  Although the law on promotion and management of foreign 
investment has been amended in recent years as more foreigners 
have invested in our country and the total value of investment 
has increased, we still have many shortcomings that should be 
settled attentively. 
  An example of such a weak point is that approval for foreign 
investors to invest in our country has been authorized in a 
hasty manner, without a careful examination or study of the 
concrete details. As a result, brokers have taken advantage of 
the situation to make contacts for foreign companies to gain 
such rights. But when they gain the rights, instead of giving 
them to the companies they work for, they sell them to companies 
in other countries. This has cost foreign companies many years 
before they could begin making investments. Worse still, when 
the brokers fail to sell the rights, they do not report the 
delay or cancellation of the investment rights to the 
authorities. As a result, those who really want to invest in 
these projects miss their chance. It has also created 
difficulty and confusion in the work sectors concerned. 
Approval of various foreign investment projects should be 
clearly fixed on the basis of what levels are authorized by the 
central level or the provincial level. 
  Another weak point is the confusion in the management 
process. There are too many steps to take and too many 
authorities that must sign papers. Moreover, there is a 
shortage of cadres working in this branch. The cadres also have 
limited knowledge and capability, thus inconveniencing investors. 
  There is an indication that foreign investment in Laos will 
expand in the future. In view of this, in order to cooperate 
with foreign countries appropriately and more effectively, it is 
necessary to implement the law on promotion and management of 
foreign investment even more strictly. The shortcomings must be 
quickly settled. Appropriate methods must be studied and put 
into actual practice in order to create conveniences for foreign 
investors and make them confident that they will obtain 
reasonable income that will gain by investing in Laos in 
accordance with state laws. In addition, direct investment in 
various forms of cooperation by foreign countries must be 
promoted. Emphasis must be placed on investment in the 
agricultural, forestry, and hydroelectric fields as well as in 
the construction of the economic and cultural infrastructure in 
order to produce goods for export. Investment in the services 
field must also be promoted. This will create the conditions 
for an accumulation of assets for the construction and 
development of our country to make it stronger with each passing 
day.

<F P=106> [By Rosemarie V. Francisco] </F>
  [Text] Environment officials and ministers of the 
six-member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) recently approved the implementation of a 
strategic plan of action on the environment (ASPEN) over a 
four-year period. 
  The approval of the plan was a major achievement of the 6th 
ministerial meeting on the environment since it harmonized 
environmental quality standards in the region, said Department 
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Undersecretary 
Benjamin Bagadion, Jr. who headed the ASEAN Senior Officials on 
the Environment (ASOEN), the technical group which drafted the 
action plan. 
  Also, the ASEAN-member countries gave their go-signal to the 
proposal allowing the Philippines to house the ASEAN 
biodiversity center. This facilitates the release of the U.S. 
$19 million funding for the center which will be provided by the 
European Union, since the funding was hedged on whether the 
ASEAN will approve the proposal. 
  The approval of the action plan took less than year. The 
plan, which has 10 strategies and 27 specific actions spelled 
out the countries' commitments with regard to sustainable 
development. 
  Mr. Bagadion said the environment officials from Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei Darussalam 
which hosted the 6th ministerial meeting on the environment, all 
lent their full support to the action plan, thus, the speedy 
approval. 
  The ASPEN's objectives are the following: 
  -- respond to the specific recommendations of Agenda 21, 
the action plan adapted by the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development (UNCED), which required priority 
action in the region; 
  -- introduce policy measures and promote institutional 
development that encourage the integration of environmental 
factors in all developmental processes both at the national and 
regional levels; 
  -- establish long-term goals on environmental quality and 
work towards harmonized environmental quality standards for the 
ASEAN region; 
  -- harmonize policy directions and enhance operational and 
technical cooperation on environmental matters, and undertake 
joint actions to address common environmental problems; and 
  -- study the implications of ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) 
on the environment and take steps to integrate sound trade 
policies with sound environmental policies. 
  During the meeting, the ASOEN formed six working committees 
on six environmental issues such as transboundary pollution, 
nature conservation, environment conservation, marine 
environment, environment management, and information and public 
awareness in order to fully discuss the region's specific 
concerns. 
  The action plan calls for the implementation of the 
following 
10 strategies: 
  -- support the development of a regional framework for 
integrating environment and development concerns in the 
decision- making processes; 
  -- promote government-private sector interactions that 
lead towards the development of policies that mutually support 
the thrust of each sector; 
  -- strengthen the knowledge and information data base on 
environmental matters; 
  -- strengthen institutional and legal capacities to 
implement international agreements on the environment; 
  -- establish a regional framework on biological diversity 
conservation and sustainable utilization of its components; 
  -- promote the protection and management of coastal zones 
and marine resources; 
  -- promote environmentally sound management of toxic 
chemicals and hazardous wastes and control of transboundary 
movement of hazardous waste and their dispersal; 
  -- develop a system for the promotion of 
environmentally-sound technologies; 
  -- promote regional activities that strengthen the role of 
major groups in sustainable development; and 
  -- strengthen the coordinative mechanism for the 
implementation and management of regional environment programs.

  [Excerpt] The Senate finally ratified yesterday a bill 
amending the build-operate-transfer (BOT) law to enable greater 
participation of the private sector in infrastructure 
development. 
  The ratification, now by both houses of Congress, paves the 
way for the bill's formal enactment into law. 
  Senate bill 1586 is entitled "An act amending certain 
sections of Republic Act 6957 entitled An act authorizing the 
financing, construction, operation, and maintenance of 
infrastructure projects by the private sector." 
  While the compromise bill retains the 60 percent-40 percent 
nationality requirement for BOT contracts, the scheme provides 
for several variations in which the private sector may 
participate. 
  Among them are: 
  -- build-and-transfer, where the private sector undertakes 
financing and construction and turns it over to government which 
shall pay the contractor its total investment plus reasonable 
rate of return; 
  -- build-own-and-operate, where the private sector 
constructs and operates project and is allowed to recover 
investment by collecting tolls and other fees; 
  -- build-lease-and-transfer, where the private sector 
finances a project, turns it over to the government on a lease 
arrangement for a fixed period of time, after which the project 
is automatically owned by the government; 
  -- build-transfer-and-operate, where government contracts 
out project to the private sector which builds the facility, 
assumes cost overruns, delays, and other risks; 
  -- contract-add-and-operate, where the private sector adds 
to an existing facility which it is renting from government, and 
operates it for a period of time. 
  Other variations of the BOT as spelled out in the bill of 
Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, are the 
develop-operate-transfer, rehabilitate-operate-transfer, 
rehabilitate-own-operate, and project proponent where the 
private sector assumes contractual responsibility for the 
project. 
  The senator said only projects with an estimated cost of 
more 
than P300 million [Philippine pesos] will require approval by 
the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). 
  Local projects to cost from P50 million to P200 million will 
need the approval of the regional development councils. 
  Another feature of the bill which is expected to "attract" 
foreigners is a provision minimizing congressional inquiries 
into an ongoing BOT project, she said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>
  [Text] A communist leader yesterday warned Jose Maria 
Sison his faction is ready to retaliate if the Netherlands-based 
central committee will attempt to kill oppositionists. 
  Arturo Tabara, allegedly one of the insurrectionists or 
anti-reaffirmist faction, a group strongly opposed to Mr. 
Sison's revolutionary strategies, confirmed his group already 
has a liquidation order from the communist hierarchy. 
  He said the anti-reaffirmist faction will be the 
leadership's 
first target because it has a strong following and has been a 
consistent critic of Mr. Sison's "defective ideological 
foundation." 
  Based on intelligence reports, the faction has the largest 
number of members coming from the central committee and the 
entire Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). Its largest 
group is the Manila-Rizal Regional Committee (MRRC) which was 
said to have 40 percent of the entire party membership. 
  Recently, the New People's Army (NPA) Melito Glor Command, 
the group who owned responsibility for the killing of former NPA 
leader Leopoldo Mabilangan, said their next targets are Mr. 
Tabara, alleged former head of the CPP's Visayas Commission; 
Romulo Kintanar, alleged former NPA chief; Felimon Lagman, 
alleged leader of the breakaway Manila-Rizal Regional Party 
Committee (MRRC); and, Ricardo Reyes, alleged former CPP 
secretary general. 
  Gregorio Rosal, spokesperson of the command reportedly 
chaired by Mr. Sison himself, said the "renegades" of the 
communist movement are involved in counter-revolutionary 
activities. 
  But Mr. Tabara said his group's activities in the past were 
under the party's "official revolutionary policy." 
  He admitted CPP members' involvement in kidnapping and other 
activities considered illegal under the Philippine law, but said 
they were done under the communist party's expropriation policy. 
  The expropriation policy, he said, is the act of 
confiscating 
movable and immovable properties from landlords, bank, 
multinational corporations in order to contribute to the party's 
cause. 
  He said Mr. Sison cannot condemn former partymates of these 
activities because expropriation had been an "open practice" 
before it was "centralized to the politburo." 
  "Bakit kami lang? Dapat responsibility yon nang buong party. 
Dapat suriin ang policy para magkaroon ng pagbabago [Why only 
us? It should be the responsibility of the whole party. The 
policy should be reviewed to have a reform]," Mr. Tabara said. 
  He echoed Mr. Reyes' statement the other day that the 
central 
committee leaders should explain the activities of the people's 
court. "Hindi na iyan yung people's court dati [It is not the 
old people's court]. We are not expecting fair trial anymore. 
As good as sentenced na kami [We are good as sentenced 
already]." 
  "We strongly warn Sison and his Stalinist faction to stop 
all 
the pretense of judicial process to mete out orders of summary 
executions of opposition leaders." 
  He also laughed off Mr. Sison's accusation that the 
oppositionists are out to liquidate him. "Walang assassination 
plot laban kay Sison. Gawa-gawa lang nya yon [There is no 
assassination plot against Sison. He just made it up]," he said.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 28 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
Thursday welcomed the proposed international conference to find 
a comprehensive solution to the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
but stressed that the fundamental premises should remain right 
and valid. 
  Malaysia also called on the United Nations to lift the arms 
embargo immediately to allow a sovereign member state to defend 
itself from Serbian aggression. 
  Speaking at the United Nations Security Council debate on 
Bosnia- Herzegovina in New York, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad 
Badawi said the UN should also arm and equip the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) troops accordingly, so that they could enforce 
the peace and protect the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The text of Abdullah's speech was faxed to BERNAMA from the 
Office of the Permanent Mission of Malaysia to the UN in New 
York. 
  On the international conference, Abdullah said the proposed 
peace process should involve the parties of the conflict, namely 
the major powers, the UN, Organisation of Islamic Conference 
(OIC) member countries and the UNPROFOR-troop contributing 
countries. 
  Abdullah said that to achieve peace, the international 
community must contribute to the peace process by setting in 
place the structures and the necessary conditions. 
  Malaysia, he said, was also disappointed with some countries 
for hindering the work of the international war crimes tribunal. 
He added that there was enough evidence to put on trial Serbian 
leaders for their atrocities. 
  Abdullah said Malaysia would contribute US$2 million (about 
RM5 million) towards defraying the cost of the work of the 
tribunal.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed. -- ASEAN members will apply the 
same standards to minimise air and water pollution by the year 
2010. 
  Science, Technology, and Environment Minister Datuk Law 
Hieng 
Ding said today the commitment was made at the sixth ASEAN 
ministerial meeting on the environment under the Bandar Seri 
Begawan Resolution on Environment and Development. The two-day 
meeting in Brunei ended yesterday. 
  Describing it as a major breakthrough, he said applying the 
same environmental standards would ensure efforts to contain 
water and air pollution were harmonised in the region. 
  ASEAN members have targeted that by the year 2010, the 
pollutant standards index (PSI) for air quality should be below 
100 PSI, while for river water, the PH (acidity) should be 
between six and 8.5. The other water quality parameters include 
dissolved oxygen of 2 mg/1 or more and total suspended solids 
(TSS) of 200 mg/1 or less. 
  Further to this, he said 1995 had been declared ASEAN 
Environment Year where each member country would highlight 
specific events to commemorate the occasion. 
  Besides official meetings, ASEAN members would hold informal 
discussions on the environment from time to time. Malaysia will 
take the lead by holding the first informal meeting at the end 
this year. 
  Law said ASEAN members had agreed to strengthen regional 
cooperation in the monitoring of transboundary movement of toxic 
wastes. This was in line with the Basel Convention members' 
agreement on the immediate export ban of toxic waste from 
industrialised to developing nations 
  "At the meeting, we pledged to actively implement actions as 
outlined in Agenda 21 and promote th principles contained in the 
1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. 
  "Under our ASEAN Strategic Plan of Action on the Environment 
for 1994 to 1998, we reached a consensus to harmonise policy 
directions as well as to enhance operational and technical 
cooperation. 
  "We also agreed to undertake joint action to address common 
environmental problems," he told reporters after attending the 
weekly cabinet meeting. 
  Law also said the concerted efforts by ASEAN ministers to 
integrate environment and economic policies at regional level 
was testimony that developing countries were sincere and 
committed in achieving sustainable development. 
  "We need to guard ourselves against the developed countries 
lest they accuse us of disregarding our environment in our 
pursuit of development. They may resort to such tactics to 
impose trade sanctions against us. 
  To push ASEAN in the forefront on environment, he added it 
had been proposed that the ASEAN secretary general be 
represented at the Commission on Sustainable Development (an 
outcome of the 1992 earth summit) meeting in New York at the end 
of next month.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Mon. -- The Royal Malaysian Air Force 
[RMAF], which is buying MiG-29 air superiority fighter jets from 
Russia, wants a simulator for training to be included in the 
package. 
  RMAF Chief Lt. Jen. [Lieutenant General] Datuk Abdul Ghani 
Aziz said today this was a problem because the Russians did not 
manufacture simulators to train pilots prior to their flight 
training. 
  "To overcome this problem, we are looking for manufacturer a 
of simulators to come up with one for th MIG-29. 
  "However, we need to deal with the problem of intellectual 
property rights as the Russian aircraft manufacturer has to 
allow data on the MiG-29 to be fed into the simulator 
manufacturer's computers before such a machine can be built." 
  Abdul Ghani was asked what was holding up the contract, 
believed to be worth between RM [Malaysian ringgit] 1.2 billion 
and RM1.6 billion, for the jets despite the Russians being early 
on the scene compared with their United States' rival, McDonnell 
Douglas, in pitching for the supply of new aircraft. 
  Unlike the Americans, the Russians had been pushing for the 
sale of their aircraft as early as 1992 and had even got the 
contract drafted out as late as last year. 
  Abdul Ghani was speaking to reporters after a courtesy call 
from his Philippines counterpart Major General Nicasio Rodriguez 
at his office at Wisma Pertahanan here. 
  Rodriguez had earlier called on Armed Forces chief Jen. Tan 
Sri Borhan Ahmad. 
  Abdul Ghani said it was important that the RMAF obtained a 
simulator to train its new pilots, especially to deal with 
emergencies. 
  "Some of the crashes involving new pilots are due to pilot 
error ... they are not able to handle situations such as 
simulated emergencies." he added.

<F P=106> [Article by Ralhanah Abdullah] </F>
  [Text] Melaka, 30 March--The Malaysian Army will establish 
an elite force to be known as Gerak Cepat Khas 10 Briged Para 
[10th Special Rapid Deployment Parachutist Brigade] to provide a 
special defense force for use whenever the country faces a 
critical situation. 
  Gen. Ismail Omar, commander of the Malaysian Army, said that 
this force will consist of personnel from the 8th Royal Ranger 
Regiment (Parachutist), the 9th Royal Malay Regiment, and the 
17th Royal Malay Regiment. Gen. Ismail said that their training 
program is now under way, and it is hoped that this force can be 
formally established by next Army Day, 16 September 1994. He is 
aware that many problems will be faced by members of this force, 
such as the need to become accustomed to parachute jumping. 
However, he hopes that they will be patient and zealous in 
carrying out their training. 
  This force needs to be formed now because a number of other 
countries have already established such a force in an effort to 
improve their defensive resources even further. According to 
Gen. Ismail, it is only proper for Malaysia to establish such a 
force also to deal with crisis situations. He said this after 
reviewing the equipment of this force and the activities of its 
personnel at Terendak Camp, Masjid Tanah, in Melaka on 30 March. 
  According to Gen. Ismail, when this force is formally 
organized, consideration will be given to sending its members to 
serve with the United Nations. 
  Furthermore, he reminded Army personnel in this country 
always to be alert when on the highways, particularly when they 
are riding motorcycles. A total of 846 traffic accidents have 
occurred throughout the country involving members of the armed 
forces, 10 percent of which have involved fatalities. He said: 
"I think accidents involving members of the Army are expensive 
because training newly enlisted personnel takes a long time." 
  He also said that in 1994 2,000 housing units will be 
provided to Army personnel. This total will be increased to 
satisfy a need for 28,000 housing units. In the State of Melaka 
alone 1,200 housing units will be built in 1994.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Allocation Proves BN (National </F>
Front) Sincerity"] 
  [Text] The approval of an allocation of 500 million ringgit 
for implementing projects in Sabah shows the sincerity of the 
National Front (BN) government's promise to fulfill its 
responsibilities to the people of that still backward state. The 
announcement of the allocation was made only a few days after 
the BN formed a new government in the state. The allocation 
proves the BN government feels that efforts to develop Sabah can 
no longer be delayed. It is up to the state government under the 
leadership of Tan Sri Sakaran Dandal to speed the process of 
preparing a project proposal paper, which needs to consider the 
overall benefits to be enjoyed by the people of Sabah. In our 
view, although the money may be available, it should not be 
spent indiscriminately or without careful study. We should not 
be too greedy, as though money were "falling from the sky." The 
money is the people's money and needs to be channeled to the 
people wisely. Therefore, each proposed project should consider 
local economic and social interests in order to avoid waste. 
Waste will bring disaster. To ensure efficient management and 
administration, social and economic research should be conducted 
first. 
  Considering the present condition of the Sabah people, we 
agree with the view of Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar 
Ibrahim that projects for supplying water and electricity need 
to be given priority. These two basic facilities are normally 
the absolute measure of poverty. Naturally, the focus will be on 
rural residents, who lived in helplessness under the previous 
government, which was led by the Sabah United Party (PBS). 
  For members of the state legislature (led by the BN) in an 
area like that, it is their duty and responsibility to make 
detailed recommendations on what the government needs. They can 
get information immediately from development officials of the 
state or from the respective divisions and districts. The most 
effective thing for them to do will be to visit the people and 
see their helplessness for themselves, instead of receiving 
information while they occupy soft seats in their offices. That 
is not the kind of BN member that the people of Sabah are 
expecting. BN legislators must serve the people in the best 
possible way. We need for them to prove to the Sabah people that 
they were elected because of their ability to serve the people 
and state of Sabah. For those who left their original parties 
and joined the BN, this is their time to prove that, having no 
confidence in their original parties, they did not transfer for 
their own interests but for the interests of the people. 
  If, as the BN has charged, the PBS could not develop Sabah 
because of its unwillingness to cooperate with the Central 
Government, the time has come for BN legislators to prove the 
truth of that statement. They need to prove that the PBS has 
indeed been an obstacle to progress. Thus, they need to prove 
that through the BN the situation will be greatly changed. We do 
not want BN legislators to be negligent in taking action, to 
give opportunity to the PBS, or to return "unripe fruit" to the 
BN. The BN will be tested at least once every five years. We do 
not want Sabah to return to its original condition, which will 
make it more difficult for us to take power. The experience of 
the last election should be a lesson on how hard it is for the 
BN to eradicate the state-centered sentiment created by the PBS. 
  We realize that from now on Sabah needs to act more 
appropriately in order to be on an equal footing with states 
administered by the BN. Despite enthusiasm, however, we do not 
want the BN to slip or follow erratic impulses that cannot 
benefit the people as a whole. 
  We also agree that the government should speed up its effort 
to establish a university in Sabah. It is only through building 
such a university that we will see all the people of the state, 
whether rich or poor, receiving equal benefit. As long as they 
have the qualifications, all the people deserve to occupy 
Sabah's grand ivory tower.

  [Text] Shah Alam, 29 Mar--UMNO [United Malays National 
Organization] leaders at the division and branch level in the 
Federal Territory and Selangor have been directed to campaign to 
ensure that all UMNO members register to vote. 
  Tan Sri Muhammad Muhd. Taib, chairman of the UMNO Liaison 
Committee for the Federal Territory and Selangor, said yesterday 
that a review should be made of UMNO membership lists and voter 
lists to ensure that all members become voters in general 
elections. He said that UMNO members who are found qualified to 
vote but have not registered should be helped to register. 
  "It is regrettable that there are UMNO members who are 
qualified to vote but are not registered as voters," he said 
today after attending a meeting for the signing of a cooperative 
agreement between the Selangor Foundation and Pembinaan Mitra 
Jaya Sdn. [Incorporated] Bhd. [Limited] (PMJ). 
  Last Friday [25 March], UMNO Vice President Datuk Sri Najib 
Tun Razak, who is also chairman of the UMNO Membership 
Enlargement Committee, said that 388,466 UMNO members who are 
qualified to vote have not yet registered. 
  Muhammad said the UMNO Liaison Committee for the Federal 
Territory and Selangor will discuss the issue, primarily to 
determine the exact number of UMNO members over 21 years of age 
who have not registered as voters. He said those who are 18 are 
qualified to be UMNO members but cannot yet register as voters.

  [Text] Georgetown, 27 Mar--Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri 
Anwar Ibrahim urged the private sector to give full support to 
the development effort and the advancement of the people in this 
country. He said the private sector's support is necessary 
because it bears some social responsibility. In fact, the nation 
cannot boast of cultural and educational development if it is 
not matched by economic growth. 
  "Approaches to development do not mean economic methods 
alone 
but include culture and intellectual traditions, such as a 
climate of reading, which needs to be supported by the private 
sector," he said. He said this tonight in a speech at the start 
of a dinner held by the Pulau Public Library Board. Also present 
were Pulau Pinang Chief Minister Dr. Koh Tsu Koon and Deputy 
Chief Minister Datuk Dr. Ibrahim Said. 
  Anwar, who is also minister of finance, said full advantage 
needs to be taken of economic growth to prove that the 
development concept we are following has a unique and distinct 
corporate philosophy. 
  "Conceptual approaches to development in this country are 
different, and we need not borrow all the experience of the 
private sector in the West in order to create a national 
economic system," he said. In that connection, he said, the 
people want to see a Malaysia that is successful in keeping the 
growth rate at around 8 percent and inflation below 4 percent. 
He urged the public and private sectors to compete and 
cooperate and to reject an attitude of happiness with the growth 
we have already enjoyed, because such an attitude could hinder 
development efforts.

<F P=106> ["Nuclear Development of S. Korean Puppet Clique denounced" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party [SDP] in 
a statement on April 30 branded the nuclear arms development of 
the South Korean puppet clique as an open challenge to the 
desire of the whole nation for peace and peaceful reunification 
on the Korean peninsula and an unpardonable criminal act of 
reducing to a waste paper the "agreement on reconciliation, 
nonaggression, cooperation and exchange between the North and 
the South" and "joint declaration on the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula". 
  The statement says: 
  The DPRK already proposed at talks with the United States to 
replace graphite moderated nuclear reactors by light water 
reactors in order to remove the "suspicion" of the United States 
and international reactionaries and reached even an agreement on 
the way of it. 
  Therefore, if the graphite moderated nuclear reactors are 
replaced by light water reactors, the "suspicion of nuclear 
development" by the DPRK will be removed. But the United States 
is raising a hue and cry over "suspected nuclear development", 
while failing to implement the agreed points. This is an 
outrageous act. 
  The South Korean rulers must admit of their own accord that 
the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multi-purpose 
research reactor in the Taedok complex are reactors for the 
development of nuclear weapons, take a measure to eliminate 
them, open to the public the truth of the secret development of 
nuclear weapons they have stepped up while trying to do harm to 
the DPRK, apologize for it before the nation and remove the 
already stockpiled nuclear materials. 
  If the South Korean authorities continue the adventurous 
development of nuclear weapons in defiance of protest and 
denunciation from the entire Korean people and international 
public, they will be held fully responsible for all consequences 
from it. 
  The United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
must renounce the unfair policy of double standard in nuclear 
inspection, refrain from putting "pressure" on the North which 
has no intention to produce nuclear weapons, and take issue with 
the nuclear development of the South Korean authorities and 
bring chief culprits to the dock.

  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued 
the following statement denouncing the Japanese authorities' 
hostile maneuvers [choktaesi chaektong] against the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon], a 
dignified overseas citizens' organization of our Republic, which 
are reaching a grave extent these days. 
  A Statement of a Spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry: 
  The Japanese authorities' hostile maneuvers against 
Chongnyon, a dignified overseas citizens' organization of our 
Republic, are reaching a grave extent these days. 
  Some time ago, the Japanese authorities sent scores of 
mobile 
police vehicles and some 1,000 policemen who encircled and 
threatened the Osaka Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon all 
day and kicked up a violent row, forcibly searching office rooms 
of the headquarters, residences of its responsible 
functionaries, and its affiliated organizations. 
  Prior to this, the Japanese rightist gangsters, under the 
behind- the-scenes manipulation of the authorities, crowded to 
the central headquarters of Chongnyon and its affiliated 
organizations and made a reckless disturbance, chanting, 
"Koreans go home," and "Disband the Korean Cbongnyon." Thus 
debasing the dignity of the Korean residents in Japan, they even 
committed a crime of murdering a Chongnyon businessman. 
  This is a hostile act of encroaching upon the sovereignty of 
Chongnyon and violently trampling upon the democratic national 
right of the Korean residents in Japan and a challenge to our 
Republic which cannot be overlooked. 
  Facts show that the Japanese reactionary authorities' direct 
suppression of Chongnyon has begun and that their hostile policy 
against our Republic has reached a reckless stage. 
  In Japan, which claims itself to be a law-governed state, 
the 
police pounced upon and kicked up a row in broad daylight 
against the legitimate Chongnyon organizations which they should 
protect. Crowding in groups, the gangsters are openly committing 
murder and violence, encroaching upon human rights against the 
Korean residents in Japan. This is really surprising. 
  There have been numerous instances of Japanese authorities' 
hostile acts and suppression against Chongnyon and the Korean 
residents in Japan. But the incidents such as noted above have 
occurred for the first time since the formation of Chongnyon and 
are arousing an unbearable indignation of all the Korean people 
and the Japan-resident Koreans. We resolutely denounce the 
Japanese reactionary authorities' crime as part of the 
anti-DPRK, anti- Chongnyon maneuvers. 
  We cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the 
Japanese authorities are conducting a suppression of Chongnyon 
and Koreans in Japan, while intentionally aggravating the 
situation over the fictitious nuclear issue of the DPRK at the 
instigation of the United States. 
  Chongnyon is a peace-loving organization whose activities 
are 
officially recognized by the Japanese authorities and Japanese 
law and which enjoys the full support of many countries and 
organizations in the world. There is neither reason nor ground 
for Chongnyon to be an object of a crackdown by the Japanese 
authorities. 
  Moreover, Korean compatriots in Japan are innocent Korean 
people who were forcibly taken to Japan and subjected to hard 
toil under the brutal Japanese imperialist rule, and their 
descendants. Therefore, special protection must be granted to 
them by the Japanese authorities. 
  However, far from apologizing for and liquidating the past 
crimes committed against the Korean people, the Japanese 
authorities are engaging in the suppression of Koreans in Japan 
and their legitimate organizations. This is an unpardonable act. 
  We will consider any crackdown on Chongnyon an encroachment 
upon the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and resolutely 
counter it [kue tanhohi taeunghae nagalkosida]. 
  The Japanese authorities should ponder over the grave 
consequences to be entailed by their reckless acts, immediately 
stop their crackdown on Chongnyon and Korean compatriots in 
Japan and apologize for it. 
  We express the hope that all the progressive personages and 
broad sections of people in Japan and the world will continue to 
express support and solidarity for the righteous activities of 
Chongnyon for its democratic national rights and national 
reunification. 
  29 April, 1994, Pyongyang.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] -- 
Officials of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and other organizations and Korean residents 
in Japan are lifting up louder voices of protest against the 
Japanese authorities openly cracking down on Chongnyon, 
clamouring about fictitious "nuclear suspicion of the North". 
  Kim Chong-mun, chairman of the Higashinari branch of the 
Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, said that the 
Korean compatriots in Japan got angry with the fascist crackdown 
on the prefectural headquarters and its branches by the Japanese 
police and that they would meet the intolerable challenge of the 
reactionaries with a united force and make all efforts to defend 
their organizations and the nation. 
  Kim Ae-min, chairperson of the Higashiyodogawa, Osaka 
Prefecture branch of the Democratic Union of Korean Women in 
Japan, said that they would further consolidate the 
singlehearted unity and counter the suppression by the 
reactionaries with a struggle. 
  Hong Chang-kwang, director of the organization department of 
the Taito branch of the Tokyo metropolitan headquarters of 
Chongnyon, strongly demanded that Japanese authorities 
immediately stop the crackdown on Chongnyon and Korean residents 
in Japan, saying that the recent incident is a product of the 
national chauvinist policy of the Japanese Government 
authorities. 
  Yi Chu-song, chairman of the Kanto District headquarters of 
the union of Korean students studying at Japanese schools, 
warned that if the Japanese authorities continued to pursue the 
hostile policy against Korea and Korean nation without 
repentance of their past colonial domination over Korea, they 
would face the strong denunciation of the Korean residents in 
Japan and conscientious people of Japan. 
  Kim Chong-kil, director of the International Department of 
the Fukuoka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, and Choe 
In-chol, vice-chairman of the Tokyo metropolitan headquarters of 
the League of Korean Youth in Japan, denounced the forcible 
search by the Japanese authorities as total challenge of Japan 
to Chongnyon. 
  On April 27, officials of Chongnyon organizations of 
different levels and Korean residents in Japan staged a protest 
against the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and the 
Higashi police station of Osaka Prefecture. 
  Branches of the Osaka prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon 
held protest meetings.

<F P=106> ["Sinister Confab To Strengthen `Cooperation System'" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
reportedly called Hata, the new prime minister of Japan, on the 
phone on May 1 and agreed with him to strengthen the 
"cooperation system" between South Korea, Japan and the United 
States on the pretext of North Korea's "nuclear issue". 
  Abominable, indeed, is the act of the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
who ringed up Hata, who had consistently been engaged in the 
anti-DPRK campaign, as soon as the latter seated himself in the 
prime minister's office, to "congratulate" him upon his 
"assumption of office" and agreed with him to strengthen 
"cooperation system" against the DPRK. 
  In the phone call the traitor Kim threw his weight behind 
the 
"unstable Hata regime" by saying "stability of the Japanese 
political situation is beneficial to Asia as a whole". And he 
ridiculously begged Hata to maintain the "foundation of 
diplomacy and cooperation in the international community" which 
had been agreed upon between South Korea and Japan while 
Hosokawa was in office. 
  This eloquently tells that the Kim Yong-sam group is a group 
of special-class pro-U.S., pro-Japanese sycophant traitors who 
cannot subsist even a single day without the backing of the 
United States and Japan. 
  Hata, taking issue with the DPRK's "nuclear issue", said he 
would "maintain a steadfast stance" and "carry forward the 
Japan-South Korea cooperation system" established during 
Hosokawa's office as prime minister. This vividly indicates the 
Japanese authorities' insidious attempt to take an active part 
in the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. 
  It is a futile attempt for the South Korean puppets and the 
Japanese reactionaries to try to contain the DPRK militarily 
through tieup with each other. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must refrain from seeking a system to 
do harm to the nation, clearly mindful that the invocation of a 
"cooperation system" would finally result in ruining themselves. 
And the Japanese reactionaries had better discard their 
anachronistic daydream of harming others and act with discretion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The new director general 
of the Japan Defence Agency recently told a press conference 
upon his assumption of office that, depending on the tensions 
growing on the Korean peninsula, they should "cope with it even 
by altering an interpretation of the Constitution". Earlier, 
the new Japanese Prime Minister, Hata, raved that "a 
constitutional debate should be made in the direction of 
recognizing Japan's exercise of the right to collective 
self-defence in case of `emergency' so as to provide against the 
nuclear issue of North Korea". 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst today says this shows that the 
Japanese reactionaries are scheming to justify their moves 
toward a military power and nuclear armament on the pretext of 
the DPRK's "nuclear issue" and, at the same time, to use it as 
an excuse for military reinvasion of Korea. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters' talk about 
"constitutional debate" and "legislative measures" to cope with 
"emergency" on the Korean peninsula is intended to lay a legal 
foundation for military aggression on Korea on the pretext of 
the DPRK's "nuclear issue". 
  In other words, they are intending to malrevise the present 
constitution and the "self-defence forces act" on the pretext of 
"coping with" the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK and thus to stage 
a comeback to Korea militarily without any restrictions and give 
a semblance of legitimacy to it. 
  Noteworthy is that the Japanese reactionaries openly 
revealed 
their scheme to stage a comeback to Korea at a time when the 
United States has become all the more undisguised in its 
anti-DPRK campaign. 
  The Japanese reactionaries are further strengthening their 
collusion and tieup with the United States and the South Korean 
puppets, unusually becoming undisguised in their anti-DPRK 
moves. It is not fortuitous that confabs were held recently 
between the military brasshats of the United States and Japan 
and between those of Japan and the South Korean puppet army to 
"cope with North Korea's nuclear issue" and agreements were 
reached between them on strengthening military cooperation. 
  All this proves that the Japanese reactionaries' scheme for 
military reinvasion of Korea is being promoted at a dangerous 
phase. The Japanese reactionaries, however, will get nothing 
from their policy hostile to the DPRK and moves for military 
re-aggression. 
  They must ponder over grave consequences to be entailed by 
their policy hostile to the DPRK and stop running recklessly.

<F P=106> ["No Export Control Apparatus Will Have Effect on DPRK, </F>
Declares Foreign Ministry Spokesman of the DPRK" -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
declared that just as the "Coordinating Committee for Export to 
Communist Area" (Cocom) [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral 
Export Controls] had no effect on the DPRK in the past, the 
second "Cocom" and any other international export control 
apparatus will have no effect on it. 
  "We will not be frightened by the appearance of any export 
control apparatus," the spokesman said. 
  The spokesman made this stand clear, answering a question 
put 
by KCNA today concerning the moves of the United States and 
other Western countries to bring into shape the second "Cocom", 
another export control machine, in the wake of the dismantling 
of the "Cocom". 
  The spokesman said: 
  "In making haste with the formation of a new export control 
apparatus, the United States seeks to bar the developing 
countries from making an independent progress through economic 
and scientific- technological development and subjugate them 
and, at the same time, restrict and control the economic and 
trade relations of the Western countries with the developing 
countries through the medium of this apparatus. Judging from 
this, the `development' and `prosperity' of the international 
community harped on by the United States are all an empty talk 
intended to conceal its wild design to establish its domination 
and gain world supremacy. 
  "It must not go unnoticed that the DPRK and other developing 
countries have been designated as objects of control by the 
export control machine to be knocked into shape under the 
pretext of `preventing threat to world peace'. 
  "As far as the threat to world peace is concerned, it comes 
from the United States and its followers, not from the 
developing countries. This is an undeniable fact. 
  "The developing countries are on guard against the scheme of 
the United States and other Western countries to frame up the 
second `Cocom' for economic blockade on them. What is important 
at present is for the developing countries to substantially 
realise South-South cooperation on the principle of collective 
self-reliance. 
  "The Western countries must not make light of the attempt of 
the United States to have the field to itself in the economic 
domain."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
have continued aerial espionage on the northern half of Korea in 
April by bringing Pacific-based RC-135 strategic reconnaissance 
planes, E-3 early warning planes and P-3 anti-submarine planes, 
according to military sources. 
  On April 29 and 28, an overseas-based E-3 early warning 
plane 
made aerial espionage on the strategic in-depth areas of the 
northern half of Korea in the skies above Yangpyong, Umsong and 
Tanyang, South Korea. 
  On April 27 and 22, an Okinawa-based RC-135 strategic 
reconnaissance plane flew to South Korea and carried out 
photographing and electronic espionage on the whole area of the 
northern half of Korea in the sky above the Military Demarcation 
Line. 
  On April 29, a U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance 
plane based in South Korea committed an aerial espionage on the 
strategic depth and inland areas of the northern half of Korea 
in the skies above Tokjok Islet, Yangpyong and Yangyang, South 
Korea. 
  On April 22 and 21, over 30 spy planes including RV-1s, 
RC-12s and RF-4Cs staged round the clock aerial espionage. 
  Aerial espionage of the U.S. imperialists have become more 
frequent with the start of the hwarang war game of the South 
Korean puppets. 
  The espionage committed by the U.S. imperialists in April 
against the northern half of Korea numbered more than 250. 
  Facts fully prove how desperately the U.S. imperialists are 
running about in their preparations for a war of aggression to 
stifle the DPRK with arms.

<F P=106> [Report by WPK Secretary Kim Chung-nin at the central report </F>
meeting marking May Day held at the People's Palace of Culture 
in Pyongyang -- live] 
  [Text] Comrades: Today, we are meaningfully marking May 
Day, the international holiday of the workers around the world, 
at a time when all working people, including the working class, 
are vigorously waging the general onward movement of socialism 
in the high revolutionary spirit under the banner of the chuche 
idea and under the anti-imperialist banner for independence. 
  On this day, I warmly congratulate the entire working class 
and working people, who are striving hard for the development 
and enrichment of the socialism of our own style and the victory 
of the chuche revolutionary cause, under the authority and in 
the name of the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee. 
[applause] 
  I extend militant greetings to the workers and people of 
different strata in South Korea, who are fighting courageously 
for the anti-U.S. struggle for independence, democratization, 
the peaceful reunification of the fatherland, and the right to 
live, looking upon the Republic as the beacon of hope. [applause] 
  I offer warm compatriot greetings to .7 million fellow 
countrymen in Japan and all other fellow countrymen abroad, who 
are retaining the nation's sovereignty and honor and are 
vigorously waging the patriotic struggle for the prosperity of 
the socialist fatherland and the independent, peaceful 
reunification of the fatherland. [applause] 
  I, in the name of the WPK Central Committee and the Korean 
working class, extend militant greetings and firm solidarity to 
the working class and working people around the world, who are 
fighting for independence, peace, social progress, and justice 
while opposing all sorts of domination and subordination. 
[applause] 
  Comrades: Over a century of history has passed since the 
working class, who has a noble mission to realize the ideal of 
mankind and to forever relinquish the exploitation system from 
earth, began celebrating the militant holiday demonstrating its 
international solidarity and united strength. 
  This period has been a history of a righteous struggle and 
brilliant victory waged by the working class throughout the 
world that strenuously struggled for the freedom and liberation 
of the maltreated proletarian masses against the imperialist 
reactionary forces, holding aloft the banner of unity. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Unity is 
the mightiest weapon of the working class. Since its first days 
in the arena of history, the working class has always regarded 
unity as its most precious weapon in the struggle against 
international capital, and has won formidable struggles on the 
strength of unity. 
  The historic mission of the working class lies in building 
socialism, communism, and a new world in which the independence 
of humans can be fully realized. The working class has waged 
audacious struggles befitting the leading class of the 
revolution to build a new society free from exploitation and 
oppression by breaking the chains of capital. The working 
masses have demolished the bulwark of capitalism and 
triumphantly blazed the trail of socialism with the weapon of 
unity, the might of unity, overcoming manifold difficulties and 
trials. 
  Thanks to the international working class' long and 
difficult 
struggles to realize independence, a revolutionary upheaval has 
been brought about in the development of human history and the 
features of the world have been fundamentally changed. 
  In an old era, the working popular masses were suppressed, 
exploited, and forced to endure all sorts of social unfairness 
for a long time. However, such an era has ended and a new one 
has opened in which all nations of all countries can pioneer 
their fate voluntarily. 
  Breaking through the capitalist and imperialist positions 
which had dominated the world for centuries and opening a broad 
avenue to socialism -- this is the great change achieved on the 
course of implementing the working class' revolutionary cause 
and the historic triumph achieved by the world revolutionary 
people with blood. [applause] 
  The working class' cause is accompanied by the serious 
struggle of whether it is socialism or capitalism, and thus this 
can never be realized smoothly. Under the condition in which 
the reactionaries of history, in united forces, are running wild 
to desperately block the popular masses' independent onward 
march, and the imperialists and reactionaries are perpetrating 
endless attacks and all kinds of armed maneuvers, there could be 
unexpected difficulties and heartbreaking sacrifices in the 
confrontation between revolution and antirevolution. 
  Amid the imperialists and reactionaries' antisocialist 
blockade, which has become unprecedentedly vicious in recent 
years, socialism in some countries, which had been defended and 
developed for tens of years, has suffered a setback and 
capitalism has been restored. Taking advantage of this abnormal 
situation, the imperialists and reactionaries vilify the idea of 
socialism, the idea of the working class, itself as wrong, 
claiming that socialism has met its end. But this is no more 
than a reactionary sophism of the foes of socialism and its 
renegades. Even though socialism has suffered in some 
countries, this is nothing but a limited and temporary 
phenomenon. 
  Socialism, which has vibrant vitality, is the future of 
mankind. No force can hold back the basic trend of the history 
of mankind marching toward socialism. 
  Today, billions of working people around the world are 
waging 
the struggle for the right to live and freedom in defense of 
independence. In particular, former socialist countries are now 
vigorously pushing ahead with the struggle to carry out their 
independent demands, being well aware of the fact through their 
actual experiences that capitalism only devoted to the pursuit 
of money will only bring poverty to their working popular masses 
and that socialism is the only way to live. 
  Everywhere in the world now, fraternal unity is being 
rebuilt, and communists and the working popular masses are 
rising in the grand struggle for socialism. 
  The widespread movement for the revival of socialism is 
being 
waged in the countries where it has suffered a setback. The 
extensiveness of such a mass movement and political struggles 
can be clearly seen from the fact that the number of foreign 
parties signed the Pyongyang Declaration "Let Us Defend and 
Advance the Socialist Cause" has increased from 70 to 213 in two 
years. 
  All these facts vividly show that no matter how the 
imperialists and those who attempt to return to the bourgeois 
vilify the idea of socialism, socialism is alive in the hearts 
of thousands of people; mighty revolutionary parties for 
socialism still exist in the world; and no force can check the 
working class' struggle for socialism. 
  If the international working class is to defend the cause of 
socialism and promote it, it must constantly strengthen the 
driving force of the revolution with a correct guiding idea and 
must resolutely uphold the principles of socialism and 
strengthen solidarity based on independence. This is an 
important lesson that the history of the international working 
class struggle which has suffered setbacks and twists has taught. 
  The working class of our country has victoriously waged 
an arduous struggle to defend and adhere to socialism, firmly 
upholding the chuche idea--the guiding idea of the revolution of 
our times founded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song--and 
under the outstanding leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, thus always being loyal to the national and 
international duties. 
  The working class of our country upheld the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song as the center of unity and the center of 
leadership. By dint of this, the working class of our country 
was able to enter the road of a new struggle with precise 
struggle line and with organized force. 
  The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song founded 
the immortal chuche idea and awakened and organized the broad 
sections working masses including the working class under its 
banner, thus providing the revolution with its strong main 
force. Based on this, he led the difficult and complicated 
Korean revolution along the single road of victory. 
  Over the past years, our people were single-handedly able to 
win a shining victory in the long, arduous anti-Japanese 
revolutionary struggle against the 1 million-strong well-armed 
Japanese imperialist army. This was possible only because the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song organized the anti-Japanese 
patriotic force of various strata, including workers and 
peasants, into an independent revolutionary force under the 
anti-Japanese banner, rousing this force to the anti-Japanese 
war, while continuously expanding and strengthening it 
  Our working class and people, firmly united around the party 
and the leader, established our-style people's democratic system 
free from exploitation, oppression, poverty, and unemployment in 
the northern half of the republic after the liberation under 
very difficult and complicated circumstances by their 
independent chuche might. In the fiercely-fought three-year 
Fatherland Liberation War, they won a great victory of defeating 
the U.S. imperialists, the leader of world imperialism, for the 
first time in history. [applause] 
  Our working class and people waged a steadfast socialist 
revolution and socialist construction in the period of trials 
after the war as well based on strong chuche force, turning our 
country into a strong independent, self-reliant, and 
self-defending socialist state. 
  Truly, the entire course of our revolution that involved 
stern trials and epochal changes has been a proud triumphant 
history in which we strengthened the independent main force of 
the revolution and made a long march flushed with victories 
based on its might under the leadership of the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  The revolutionary cause of the working class does not end in 
one generation. It is a cause inherited and completed 
generation to generation. To achieve an ultimate completion of 
this historical cause, the problem of leadership succession must 
be solved properly. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is an 
outstanding ideologist and theoretician, great statesman, great 
military strategist, and the paragon of a true loyalist and 
dutiful child who has both literary and military accomplishments 
and is distinguished in his loyalty and filial duty. 
  The sacred chuche revolutionary cause pioneered by the great 
leader is brilliantly inherited and developed in our country 
today by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has 
excellent traits and qualifications of the leader [suryong] of 
the working class and the leader [yongdoja] of the people, at 
the supreme top [choego suwi] of the party, the state, and the 
army. [applause] 
  The ultimate victory of the chuche revolutionary cause is 
firmly ensured because the entire party membership, all the 
people, and the entire army uphold the great leader's lofty will 
in wholehearted unity around the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il and are exerting their creative might thoroughly in the 
revolution and construction in conformity with the intent of the 
party and the leader. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely led the 
struggle to accelerate the revolution and construction based on 
the might of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the party, 
and the masses by persistently keeping up the three 
revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--as a 
general line of socialist construction in conformity with the 
new conditions after the socialist revolution triumphed and a 
socialist system was established in our country. 
  What is most important in accelerating socialist 
construction and defending, adhering, and adding luster to the 
cause of socialism is to arm the members of the main force of 
the revolution firmly with the socialist ideology so that they 
can cherish socialism as their firm faith. 
  Whether we can arm people with socialist ideology or not is 
a 
fundamental problem connected with the fate of socialism. The 
superiority of socialism is the superiority of ideology, and the 
might of socialism is the might of ideology. Therefore, 
neglecting the ideological revolution is losing the life line in 
building socialism. For this reason, our party has consistently 
maintained the principle of giving definite priority to the 
ideological revolution in the struggle to build socialism, and 
is continuously deepening and developing it in conformity with 
the advance of the revolution and construction. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il further developed and 
enriched the socialist ideology based on the chuche idea, and 
exercised his wise leadership so that all the people can make 
the chuche socialist ideology their faith and morality. By so 
doing, he ensured that our socialism takes root deep in our 
people's hearts and actual life. 
  With firm faith that socialism means victory for those who 
keep it and death for those who abandon it, the working class 
and people of our country today are devoting themselves to the 
rewarding struggle to further strengthen socialist might with 
overflowing faith and optimism for the future. The communist 
ethos of working and living in a revolutionary manner, helping 
and encouraging each other from the principle of collectivism of 
one for all and all for one, is highly displayed by them. 
  The ranks of unheralded heroes, men of merit, and 
forerunners 
of communist virtue who wage a devoted struggle silently are 
increasing with each passing day. The leader, the party, and 
the masses are firmly united as a sociopolitical living organism 
sharing life, death, and destiny so that the entire society 
consists of a great revolutionary family of loyalists and 
dutiful children. This is the true feature of our society of 
which we can boast with pride to the world. [applause] 
  This shows that the slogan of abolishing class, which was 
raised aloft on the very first day when the working class 
appeared on the stage of history, has come true in our country 
today. 
  Today when we can clearly see at hand the day of the 
complete 
victory of socialism under the wise leadership of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, we take great pride and faith in 
the superiority of our-style socialism which we ourselves have 
chosen and pioneered on our own and its future. 
  Socialist society is the world for the working class. 
Our-style socialism, in particular, is the chuche socialism in 
which the party and the popular masses are firmly united and 
chuche is firmly established in all areas--political, economic, 
cultural, and military. It is the popular mass-centered 
socialism in which the people's independent and creative life 
thrive fully and in which the working class and the working 
people are masters of everything. It is the most solid and 
vital invincible socialism in which society develops 
continuously by the might of wholehearted unity. 
  The most precious wealth that our party brought forth in the 
long struggle for socialism under the banner of the chuche idea 
is the realization of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the 
party, and the masses. Our wholehearted unity is the 
ideological, volitional, moralistic, and fidelity-oriented unity 
and cohesion, and a revolutionary unity having eternal vitality. 
There is no power in the world that can destroy our 
wholehearted unity. [applause] 
  The complete unity among the leader [suryong], the party, 
and the masses, which we have achieved, is the basic factor, in 
resolutely smashing [chipusigo] any challenge of the 
imperialists and determinedly defending and safeguarding 
our-style socialism, and it is a strong driving force with which 
to brave a raging wind of antisocialism and to forcefully 
accelerate the socialist construction. 
  Indeed, the greatest dignity and pride of our working class 
and people are to build an invincible socialist powerful state 
which opens the path to becoming ever victorious only with its 
trust in its own strength and with its own might, while carrying 
out everything in our own way holding faith in chuche, in an 
unflinching manner in the teeth of any change in situation and 
the pressure from the imperialists. 
  Our working class and people are setting store by our-style 
socialism like their own lives and are full of the revolutionary 
determination to defend socialism to the end with the firm faith 
in the justness of the socialist cause and its future path. 
  The revolutionary cause of the working class is the 
international one, and the Korean revolution is a part of the 
world revolution. To consolidate the solidarity with the 
international revolutionary forces is an (?important) guarantee 
to advance the victory of the Korean revolution and carry 
forward the socialist cause throughout the world. 
  The slogan "The world's people defending independence, 
unite!" is a slogan for struggle which all people of our era 
should hold jointly. In the preceding period, our country's 
working class exerted itself to consolidate the militant unity 
and international solidarity with the working classes and 
progressive people of all world countries on the basis of its 
(?faith) in independence and socialism under the party's 
leadership. It actively contributed to the struggle to reliably 
defend the eastern outpost of socialism and make the whole world 
independent. 
  Under the anti-imperialist, pro-independence banner, we have 
supported the anti-imperialist, national liberation struggle of 
the world's oppressed people and the revolutionary movement of 
all countries' people and have endlessly developed the 
relationships of friendship and cooperation with those countries 
that treat our country favorably, including developing 
countries. We have firmly struggled to check and frustrate the 
imperialists' maneuvers of aggression and war and to defend the 
world's peace and security. 
  Our party has always adhered consistently to the principle 
of 
complete equality and mutual respect on which to solve, in 
conformity with the common interest of our people and the 
world's people and in an independent way, all problems arising 
from foreign relations, respecting other countries' sovereignty 
while thoroughly safeguarding our people's national sovereignty. 
  Our country's international relations have endlessly been 
developed and our people have numerous friends and sympathizers 
[tongjongjadul] everywhere in the world thanks to our party's 
correct foreign policy based on the idea of independence, peace, 
and friendship and its active activities in (?foreign relations). 
  The experience of our revolution, which is forcefully 
advancing the socialist cause even under the unusually difficult 
international environment, has shown that when the working 
classes of all the world's countries struggle jointly in firm 
unity supporting and cooperating with each other under the 
anti-imperialist, pro-independence revolutionary banner, they, 
as unified international revolutionary forces, can vanquish the 
imperialists and certainly build a peaceful and prosperous new 
world of independence, while defending each individual country's 
sovereignty and independence. 
  In the future, too, our country's working class will 
actively 
contribute to accelerating the completion of our revolution and 
making the whole world independent by endlessly strengthening 
the militant unity and cooperation with the working classes and 
progressive people of the whole world. [applause] 
  Comrades, 
  Because of the international reactionaries' vicious 
challenge, the working class' revolutionary movement to build a 
new world of independence and peace is today entering a grave 
phase of history. The imperialists and reactionary forces are 
all the more running amok to crush [apsal] the revolutionary 
cause of the working class and the socialist cause, and here, 
they are especially turning the brunt of the attack toward our 
Republic, the fortress of socialism. 
  The U.S. imperialists are all the more openly carrying out 
anti-Republic oppressive commotions in the international arena 
by finding fault with our nuclear issue, thus clinging to the 
military adventure to crush our socialist cause. Our nuclear 
issue, which the U.S. imperialists and their followers are 
babbling [ttodunun] about, is a product of the antisocialist and 
anti-Republic maneuvers the U.S. imperialists are persistently 
pursuing. 
  Whenever they have had the opportunity, the U.S. warmongers 
have made violent remarks by saying that pressure must be put on 
North Korea through a practical action and so on, thus openly 
revealing their attempt to resume the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise. Also, as part of an oppressive commotion against us, 
they are carrying out all kinds of military commotions such as 
deploying from the continental United States Naval ships, 
including the Patriot missile unit and a nuclear powered 
aircraft carrier, into South Korea, and are scheming to deploy 
more new military equipment. 
  The treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique undisguisedly made 
public its plan to invade the North, which had already been 
worked out under the instigation of the U.S. imperialists, made 
the entire puppet Army assume a posture of attacking the North 
under a special alert order, and while babbling about a strong 
punishment and retaliation on someone, it is blowing a very 
provocative bugle of war to link this as an opportunity to 
invade the North and achieve reunification. 
  The Japanese reactionaries are also persistently obstructing 
the resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by 
talking about a special inspection [tukpyol sachal] and 
sanctions. They are revealing the aggressive attempt to come 
forth in the military action against us in case of an emergency. 
  Because of the reckless military threat and confrontational 
maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet 
clique, the danger of war is increasing by the minute on the 
Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialists and the international 
reactionaries are running amok to isolate and suffocate our 
Republic and crush our socialism by finding fault with the 
nuclear issue, but if they think that they can submit us through 
any kind of pressure, threat, and blackmail, that is nothing but 
an anachronistic fantasy. 
  However precious peace is, our dignified people will not by 
any means beg for it, and are fully prepared to answer war with 
war and dialogue with dialogue. We are possessed with the wise 
leadership of the great leader and the respected and beloved 
supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il; the complete unity of 
the leader, the party, and the masses; and a one-a-match-for-100 
revolutionary force that can defeat in a single blow any strong 
enemy; and a strong self-supporting economy. 
  Our working class and people will never tolerate [yongnap] 
our national dignity and sovereignty being hurt 
[kondurinunkosul]. If the enemy dares to launch an attack, the 
whole country will turn into a place of guns and shells 
[chongpotan], giving the enemy only corpses and death. 
  Our working class and all the workers should march forward 
invariably upholding the banner of unity in order to continue to 
forcefully carry forward the socialist cause of chuche while 
smashing the maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries 
against socialism and the Republic. 
  The first, the second, and the third priorities, in terms of 
the basic way to advance the socialist construction while being 
confronted with the imperialist reactionary forces, are all to 
achieve the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks. 
Because of the might of the single-hearted unity nothing can 
destroy, the invincibility of our-style ever-victorious 
socialism exists and the bright future path to the revolutionary 
cause of chuche is firmly guaranteed. 
  The complete unity among the leader, the party, and the 
masses, which constitutes the eternal vitality of our country's 
socialism, originates in the endless love toward and faith in 
people held by the great leader and the dear (?leader) and in 
people's boundless sense of admiration and their absolute sense 
of trust in the leader [yongdoja]. 
  Upholding the great leader and the dear comrade leader and 
more firmly rallying around the party, our working class and all 
the people should be firmly prepared as genuine communist 
revolutionaries of chuche who deeply bear in mind their loyalty 
to the party and the leader as their firm faith, conscience, and 
sense of moral obligation and highly display such a spirit in 
every moment of their life, solidifying in every way the 
single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks. 
  Upholding with our heart the party's militant slogan as to 
accomplishing the socialist cause to the end while all the 
party, all the people, and all the Army are united in 
single-heartedness, we should resolutely smash--with the might 
of the single-hearted unity in which the leader, the party, and 
the masses are in complete unity--all the enemy's challenges and 
obstructions against socialism, thereby accomplishing the 
socialist cause of chuche to the end. 
  An (?important) issue in defending, safeguarding, and 
carrying forward the socialist cause of chuche at the present 
time is to defend the purity of socialist ideology and hold fast 
to the basic principle of socialism in a consistent way. 
  If the socialist ideology is shaken, the basic principle of 
socialism will be renounced and, then, the socialist system will 
degenerate and collapse [pyonjildoeo homulojigi maryonimnida]. 
  It is necessary to be armed with the chuche idea in order to 
firmly defend the purity of the socialist ideology. The chuche 
idea is the revolutionary one which most correctly reflects the 
aspirations and demands of the working class and it is the 
leading guideline of our era's revolution which illuminates the 
basic principle and method of socialist and communist 
construction. 
  Thanks to the great chuche idea, the status and role of the 
working class as the leading class of revolution have been 
scientifically illuminated; and a new world in which the working 
class serves as the masters of everything under the brilliant 
banner of the chuche idea is being unfolded. 
  Only when it thoroughly carries through the basic principle 
of the chuche idea can the working class see realized its 
demands that it enjoy independent rights and a genuine life, 
while breaking away from all kinds of restrictions and 
oppression and can it see the cause of remodeling the whole 
society after the pattern of the working class brilliantly 
accomplished. 
  By being firmly armed with the socialist ideology of 
chuche, our working class and all the people should resolutely 
defend their chuche-oriented position and the revolutionary 
principle under all circumstances, reject revisionism, 
doctrinism, and flunkeyism in a thorough-going manner, and 
thoroughly smash the enemy's maneuver of conciliatory tactics of 
trying to disintegrate [wahae] us through a reactionary 
ideological and cultural blockade [pongsoe]. 
  What is most important in defending, safeguarding, and 
carrying forward the socialist cause in a victorious way is to 
faithfully uphold the party's leadership. The party's 
leadership is the life and soul of the working class and the 
basic guarantee of all victories. 
  Only when it is faithful to the leadership of the party--its 
vanguard organization--can the working class, the leading class 
of revolution, smoothly carry out its mission and duty it holds 
before the times and history. 
  Our era is the glorious one which shines thanks to the name 
of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. A bright future path 
to further prosperity and advancement, when we follow his 
leadership, is firmly guaranteed. [applause] 
  All the working class and workers should hold the absolute 
sense of respect for the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il every 
time and everywhere and should live and fight on as the 
lifeguards, shock brigade members, guards, and death-defying 
corps members, loudly chanting the song of faith "Without you, 
there is no fatherland; with you alone we can win!" upholding 
his ideology and leadership. 
  In order to further illuminate our-style socialism, it is 
necessary to consolidate the might of self-reliant economy and 
highly display the superiority of our country's socialist system 
by accelerating the socialist construction. The superiority of 
the socialist system is demonstrated in people's independent and 
creative living. To endlessly increase the people's living 
standard is the highest principle of our party's activities. 
  The important purpose that our party has established a 
period 
of adjustment in the socialist economic construction and put 
forth a new revolutionary economic strategy also lies in trying 
to more smoothly guarantee the people's living standards. 
  By thoroughly accomplishing the party's revolutionary 
economic strategy and forcefully waging the three revolutions, 
ideological, technological, and cultural, our working class and 
all the workers should help the popular masses' independent and 
creative living be put into fuller bloom in all fields of their 
social life, including political, economic, and cultural ones. 
  Upholding the party's militant slogan "Let us forcefully 
accelerate the general onward march of socialism through the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude!" for which 
all the party, the whole country, and all the people are 
generally mobilized, we should thoroughly accomplish the 
agriculture-first policy, light industry-first policy, and 
trade-first policy with the spirit in which the speed of the 
nineties is added to chollima, filled with the ever-victorious 
confidence and should achieve a new great revolutionary upswing 
on all fronts of socialist construction, including coal, 
electricity, railroad transportation, and metal industries. 
  To end the national division and achieve the fatherland 
reunification is the supreme task that our working class and 
people can no longer put off. The great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, the sun of the nation, has put forth the 10-point 
program for the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the country, thereby brilliantly illuminating 
the path to achieving the national reconciliation and unity and 
to establishing an independent, peaceful, and neutral reunified 
state. He has taken all kinds of measures for their 
materialization. 
  The 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation 
is the grand charter for reunification--the most aboveboard and 
devoted to the country and people-- which embodies the pure 
desire of the 70 million countrymen aspiring to achieve the 
national reunification and prosperity in which the whole nation 
is firmly united as one, transcending the differences in 
ideologies, ideas, and systems. [applause] 
  The 10-point program for the great unity of the whole nation 
for the reunification of the country is arousing wide sympathy 
among the world's progressive people. The South Korean people 
and the compatriots abroad are also waging a forceful struggle 
to achieve by any means [kioi] the country's reunification in 
the nineties under the banner of this 10-point program. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, is marching toward 
the path to North-South confrontation, not to national 
independence, and to national strife [tongjok sangjaeng], not to 
peaceful reunification, while turning its face away from our 
broadminded proposals and the whole nation's desire for 
reunification. 
  Without checking and frustrating the maneuvers of the 
splittists within and without, we can neither desire the 
fatherland reunification nor the country's security and peace, 
nor can our nation avoid the disasters of a nuclear war. 
  The South Korean puppets should give up their silly fantasy 
of trying to block the fatherland reunification and harm their 
compatriots, relying on the foreign forces; abrogate all kinds 
of anticommunist, fascist evil laws, including the vicious 
National Security Law; immediately release all people, including 
patriotic figures fighting for the cause of reunification, who 
have been illegally arrested and imprisoned; and show with acts 
their genuine will for reunification. 
  The United States should stop its reckless maneuver of 
obstructing Korea's reunification and threatening the security 
on the Korean peninsula; no longer interfere with our country's 
internal affairs; and withdraw without delay from South Korea 
taking away all armed forces of aggression and lethal weapons. 
  Today, too, even political freedom and rights, and South 
Korean workers' basic human right to live, under the U.S. 
imperialists' occupation, are being ruthlessly trampled upon, 
under the world's worst working hell. 
  The Kim Yong-sam civilian fascist clique, which has assumed 
power while advocating building a society in which hard-working 
people can live in opulence, is abusing the workers like horses 
and bulls while appeasing and deceiving them under the 
reactionary slogan of industrial peace. 
  The puppet clique is even carrying out a fascist violent act 
of vicious suppression of the labor movement by even putting 
into action a so-called emergency arbitration, while branding 
the workers' just struggle for their right to live and for 
democracy as the so-called collective egoism. The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet regime is the most vicious blood-sucking one and the most 
cunning and ruthless one against workers. 
  It is no coincidence that a slogan "Let us smash the Kim 
Yong-sam regime, which kills workers!" has been shouted out 
among the South Korean workers. 
  The only way for the South Korean workers to get out of 
their present plight of a dead-end alley is to unite into a 
struggle to realize the independence and democratization of 
South Korean society and to achieve the country's reunification. 
  The South Korean workers should firmly unite under the 
independent democratic labor unions and wage a struggle against 
the civilian fascist dictatorship with the might of unity. In 
firm unity with the people of all strata, including the youth 
and students, they should build a new world of independence and 
democracy in the land of the South. They should wage a more 
daring struggle to realize the cause of the country's 
reunification. 
  It is an intolerable national tragedy for one nation of the 
same blood to live separated for half a century between the wall 
of division imposed by outside forces. All the Korean 
compatriots who love the country and are concerned about the 
future of the nation should be united under the banner of 
independence, the banner of the great unity of the whole nation, 
and wage a pannational struggle to open a new phase for the 
country's reunification by the independent strength of the 
nation. [applause] 
  We will make every effort in the future as well to realize 
the country's reunification by means of a confederal system 
based on one nation and one state and two systems and two 
governments according to the three principles of independence, 
peaceful reunification, and great national unity. 
  Our people's just cause for national sovereignty and peace 
and peaceful reunification of the country is receiving warm 
support and encouragement from the broad sections of the people 
of the world. I take this opportunity to express our gratitude 
to the parties, governments, and people of all countries of the 
world for their invariable sincere support and encouragement for 
our people's just cause. At the same time, I express our 
conviction that they will accord our people firm solidarity with 
our people's reunification cause in the future as well. 
[applause] 
  Today, the world situation is very tense and complicated, 
and 
the struggle between socialism and imperialism, between the 
progressive and the reactionary is waged more acutely than ever 
in the international arena. The prevailing situation demands 
that the working class of all the countries of the world further 
strengthen internationalist unity and solidarity for the victory 
of the anti-imperialist cause for independence. 
  The cause of socialism is not only a national cause, but a 
common cause of mankind. Therefore, its victory cannot be 
expected without the joint struggle of the revolutionary people 
of the world. Under the condition where the imperialists and 
reactionaries are trampling upon the independence of the popular 
masses with a combined force and are viciously maneuvering to 
crush [apsal] the cause of socialism, the working class and 
people of all countries of the world should wage a joint 
struggle firmly united under the revolutionary banner of 
anti-imperialist cause for independence in order to frustrate 
the imperialists' interference and aggressive maneuvers and 
realize the cause of independence of the entire world 
successfully. 
  It is the firm will of our working class and people to 
fulfill their sacred mission and responsibility for the cause of 
independence of the Korean people and mankind by continuously 
intensifying the international solidarity and joint struggle 
with the working class of the entire world under the banner of 
the great chuche idea and the banner of socialism. 
  The U.S. imperialists, bragging that they are the only 
superpower on earth, are engaged in all sorts of tenacious 
maneuvers, out of an ambition to dominate the world, to isolate 
and stifle [chilsik sikigo] socialist countries, to block the 
revival of socialism, and to prevent the developing countries 
from following the road of socialism. Yet the antisocialist 
maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries are doomed to 
fail, and it is the law of the development of history that the 
cause of socialism triumphs ultimately overcoming temporary 
confusion. 
  Defending and adhering to socialism from the 
antirevolutionary offensive of the imperialists and 
reactionaries at this time is a common pending struggle task 
facing the working class of the countries of the world. Under 
the ideology of independence, peace, and friendship, our party 
and people will continue to endlessly strengthen and develop the 
ties of comradely unity and international solidarity with the 
world's progressive people based on independence, equality, and 
faith in socialism. Therefore, we will put an end to the 
imperialists' domination and interference, and actively 
contribute to man's common cause to defend, adhere to, and 
advance the socialist cause. [applause] 
  Our working class and people who are resolutely fighting for 
the just socialist cause by highly upholding the banner of the 
chuche idea under the great party's refined leadership, will 
always be victorious. [applause] 
  Let us all highly uphold the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song 
and single-heartedly unite around the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il to all the more vigorously fight for the victorious 
advance of socialism of our own style, the fatherland's 
independent and peaceful reunification, and for man's bright 
future. [applause] 
  Hurrah for Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our 
party 
and our people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause] 
  Hurrah for General Kim Chong-il, the respected and beloved 
supreme commander, who is the great leader [yongdoja] of our 
party and our people! [shouts of hurrahs and applause] 
  Hurrah for May Day, the international holiday in which it is 
demonstrating the united might of the world's working class! 
[applause]

  [Text] According to Seoul radio reports, some 2,000 
students in Seoul waged a protest demonstration by staging a 
resolve rally of youths and students marking May Day in front of 
the Student's Hall of Koryo University on the afternoon of 30 
April. 
  In a resolution adopted at the rally, the students denounced 
the criminal acts of the Kim Yong-sam clique, who branded the 
workers' demand for wage hike as a group selfishness. The 
students called on students and workers to join hands in the 
struggle for the abolition of evil labor laws and the 
government-controlled labor union. 
  After the rally, the students headed to Chongno, staging a 
street demonstration.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "ARF Must Address Trouble on the South China </F>
Sea"] 
  [Text] Much to the horror of the organizers of July's 
inaugural regional defence summit in Bangkok, a real security 
issue is fast developing in the South China Sea. 
  The officials laying the groundwork for the Asean Regional 
Forum (ARF) in Bangkok had hoped to keep any potentially 
explosive topics out of the unprecedented meeting, but with 
tensions rising dangerously around the disputed Spratly Islands, 
the issue will have to be addressed if the ARF is not to become 
a farce. 
  Last week's announcement by US prospecting firm Crestone 
that 
it has begun surveying for oil off Vietnam's continental shelf 
with the "full support and protection of China" has alarmed 
regional analysts and government officials who fear that Beijing 
is bent on bringing the long-simmering dispute to a head. 
<H5>  High-risk prospecting </H5>
  Under its contract, Crestone will have access to a 
prospection area of 25,155 square kilometers, the largest area 
ever turned over to an oil company in Southeast Asia. Not only 
does the move violate a regional agreement to avoid complicating 
negotiations on the disputed archipelago, but the location of 
the concession is being seen by some as outright provocation. 
  The Crestone block is 280 kilometers southeast of the 
Vietnamese coastal city of Vung Tau and 1,100 kilometers from 
Hainan Island, the closest piece of uncontested Chinese 
territory. China also claims control of the neighbouring 
Paracel Islands where it built an air base after forcibly 
evicting the Vietnamese in 1974. But even this outcrop of rock 
is still more than 700 kilometers from the Crestone zone. 
  The Chinese claim is based on its "historic" control of 
nearly the entire South China Sea, which is bordered by 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei, and Taiwan, all of which are 
claimants to the Spratly Islands. While Beijing has repeatedly 
dismissed concerns about the so-called `China threat' and vowed 
"never to seek hegemony," it appears precisely set to do that in 
the oil-rich waterway. 
  The Crestone concession is dangerously close to Vietnam's 
Blue Dragon oil fields -- also claimed by Beijing -- and the 
onset of activity there belies Beijing's earlier promises to set 
aside competing claims and consider joint development of the 
Spratlys. 
<H5>  Issue is central to Asean </H5>
  For Asean, the Chinese action is alarming because the 
organization has long made it known that it considers the South 
China Sea a test case of China's intentions in the region. In 
particular, it revives fears of a recurrance of the bloody 
military clash between China and Vietnam in 1988. 
  The economic success of the Southeast Asian states over the 
last 15 years owes as much to the return of peace and stability 
in the region as to any other single factor. The last thing 
Southeast Asia needs is a return to the years of conflict, 
closed-door foreign policy and expensive arms purchases that 
marked the seventies. In an ominous sign, only three days after 
the Crestone announcement, Taiwan started patrolling waters 
surrounding the atolls in a bid to emphasize its claims to 
sovereignty. 
  The ARF is scheduled to hold its first session on July 25, 
after the annual meeting of foreign ministers from Asean member 
countries. China and Vietnam will attend as guests along with a 
host of other powers with security interests in the region, 
including Russia and the United States. The tentative agenda 
for the meeting is stacked with events intended to foster a 
spirit of conviviality and confidence among the 18 members 
before any serious topics are touched upon in later years. 
  But the Spratly issue needs serious multilateral attention 
before it possibly spirals out of control. Early attempts to 
defuse the row, including a joint scientific project have failed 
to yield any agreement. 
  Calling a meeting of the region's top security officials in 
a 
bid to find ways to avoid conflict is commendable. But to set 
an agenda that ignores the most pressing threat to peace in the 
region for the sake of conviviality is pointless. The South 
China Sea disputes should be settled now before they escalate. 
Avoiding them will not make them go away.

  [Text] Government officials yesterday met informally in 
Aranyaprathet District with their Cambodian counterparts to 
discuss the reopening of the border closed late last month 
following a rocket attack which wounded two Thai civilians. 
  The Cambodian delegation led by Fifth Army Region Deputy 
Commander Gen Duong Sokhon crossed the border from Poipet to 
Khlong Luk in Aranyaprathet where they met with the commander of 
the Burapha Task Force Maj-Gen Niphon Pharunnit. 
  The meeting ended inconclusively but talks are expected to 
resume after the peace negotiations in Phnom Penh from May 2-7. 
  Gen Duong told Thai reporters his troops commanded by Gen 
Lai 
Virak had successfully repulsed Khmer Rouge guerrillas from 
Highway 5. The highway is still closed to the public however. 
The general said guerrillas were grouping close to the Thai 
border at Ban Khok Sabang and Ban Nong Iam villages. 
  Gen Duong promised to investigate if the mortar shell which 
landed at Rong Kula black market on March 26 leaving two Thai 
traders injured was fired by government troops or guerrillas. 
He said he was willing to offer compensation to the victims if 
it could be proven his troops were responsible for the shelling. 
The general insisted his forces did not fire deliberately on 
Thailand. 
  Cross-border shelling is accidental, he said, and promised 
to 
instruct his troops to be more careful in the future. He also 
said he was willing to hold talks with the Thai military to 
resolve any border problems. 
  General Duong complained the price of consumer products in 
Poipet had risen sharply since the closure of the border at 
Khlong Luk-Poipet. He said officials were trying to solve the 
problem. 
  Poipet, he said, is now almost deserted with the majority of 
the people having fled elsewhere for fear of attack by the Khmer 
Rouge. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday made clear that 
Thailand would decline any request for it to be the venue of 
talks among Cambodians. 
  "Cambodia has a government of its own. The roundtable is an 
internal matter. There should be no need for (Cambodians) to 
meet in Bangkok. If they ask, it is not our affair," he said. 
  The minister had been asked whether Thailand might be a 
venue 
if the Khmer Rouge refused to go to Phnom Penh. The guerrillas 
have cited security reasons for wanting the talks, set to start 
on Monday, to take place somewhere else. The Khmer Rouge 
regarded security as important, Squadron Leader Prasong said. 
  "I think the Khmer Rouge should participate in the 
roundtable." But security measures should be well prepared, he 
said. 
  The minister maintained that "preparedness" and 
compatibility 
in systems would be important to Vietnam's becoming a full 
member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
  As a socialist country, Vietnam would need time to adjust, 
notably in terms of financial systems, including taxation and 
banking, he said. 
  The minister was commenting on reports that Indonesia had 
expressed support for Vietnam's membership of ASEAN. Vietnamese 
President Le Duc Anh yesterday was winding up a visit to 
Indonesia. 
  Asked about the prospects of competition, Sqn Ldr Prasong 
said this should not be an obstacle to Vietnam's membership of 
ASEAN. To beat the competition, the Thai private sector should 
improve quality and service, he said. 
  "We have come a long way. Vietnam needs time, perhaps 
another three or five years." 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong was reserved on reports that Indonesia is in 
favor of Vietnam becoming an observer to the Asian Pacific 
Economic Co-operation (APEC) forum. 
  "It is a good idea to have friends in the Asia-Pacific 
region 
become observers," he said. But he noted that the APEC meeting 
in Seattle last November agreed not to receive new members for 
the next three years.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Time To Close All The Refugee Camps"] </F>
  [Text] Nearly 20 years after their war ended, Indochinese 
refugees continue to tax the conscience and resources of other 
nations. A generation after the communists captured Vietnam, 
Cambodia and Laos, refugee camps dot Southeast Asia. The 
existence of these camps, and the people in them, sorely test 
the very concept of refugees. When the first Indochinese fled 
in 1975, they were fleeing violence, and either the real or 
perceived oppression they felt would occur from new regimes. In 
short, they left their countries because of fear. They were 
welcomed, or at least accepted, in neighbouring countries such 
as Thailand. The sympathy for refugees was clear, and it was 
warranted. 
  Today, it is a far different story. The three Indochina 
countries-- especially Vietnam and Laos -- are settled. All of 
these nations and their regimes have rejoined the world 
community. They deal with day-to-day problems like any other 
nation. Small battles still erupt in Cambodia, and when these 
occur at a border, it is natural that the innocent flee across 
the frontier to safety. But none of the three countries is 
embroiled in war. No large segments of the Indochina 
populations are singled out for oppression by any of the three 
governments. 
  It is, therefore, possible to understand the Hmong, Lao, 
Vietnamese and Khmer refugees in Thailand and elsewhere who are 
reluctant to return home. The lands they left were in turmoil, 
and many of the refugees feared for their lives. The dread of 
jail, "reeducation," forced separation of families and even 
worse caused the refugees to pack up and move. Since then, they 
have effectively lived in a closed society. Rumour and hearsay 
about their homelands have been the predominant form of 
information. 
  It is impossible, however, to sympathize with their claims 
to 
remain in their refugee camps or emigrate elsewhere. Their 
times of trouble have ended. The refugees are mistaking the 
warmhearted and compassionate asylum they once received with 
some sort of worldwide social welfare programme. There is 
little doubt that many would have been victims of vengeful 
regimes at home in the past. But 19 years after the fall of 
Saigon, there is clearly no such danger. It is past time for 
the Indochina refugees to pick up their lives again, in their 
own countries. 
  This task must be handled gently, but it must be handled. 
The few violent and militant refugees aside, humane officials 
must convince the Indochinese it is in their own interest to 
resume normal lives. It is to be expected that a tiny minority 
of the refugee camps will react angrily to repatriation. In the 
Vietnamese refugee camps of Galang, Indonesia, and Hong Kong, 
fighting, fasting and self-immolation has occurred. This is 
regrettable, and such acts must be carefully regulated. 
Outsiders have manipulated Hmong refugees in Thai camps with 
baseless rumours of actions both by the Thai and Laotian 
governments. Such actions must be overcome with information and 
truth, rather than force. 
  At the same time, it is vital for the refugees as well as 
neighbouring nations that these problems are, indeed, overcome. 
It is a mistake for the former refugees to believe they can 
continue to receive special treatment. Only true victims of 
great political or natural upheavals should expect such 
attention from others. The continuing claims of the Indochinese 
upon the limited resources of their neighbours and the world 
cheapens the true meaning of "refuge" as a reliable haven from 
such misfortunes. Thailand continues to award refugee status to 
both Burmese and Khmers who flee any current fighting in their 
homeland. The Indochinese who have been "refugees" for so many 
years effectively endanger even such logical aid to innocent 
people. 
  Voluntary repatriation of Indochinese should be pressed 
vigorously. The men and women in Southeast Asian camps may 
apply for emigration to other countries. But if this fails, 
they must accept -- as all other world citizens -- that 
returning to their homeland is the only possible option. Their 
dislike of their own regime should drive them to try to change 
it, if they wish. That is what dissatisfied citizens of all 
countries must do. The claim to special status by the 
Indochinese is unwarranted, in the end. Their great wars and 
political shocks have ended. It is time for both the refugees 
and those who have given them refuge in their time of turmoil 
and need to get on with their normal lives.

<F P=106> [By F.C. Kuo and Y.C. Tsai] </F>
  [Text] Bangkok, April 29 (CNA) -- Taiwan and Thailand will 
hold another round of tariff reduction talks under the framework 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in late 
June, a ranking Taiwan official said Friday [29 April]. 
  Lin Yi-fu, deputy director-general of Taiwan's Board of 
Foreign Trade, made the statement following the conclusion of 
the first round of negotiations here. 
  Lin led a 13-member Taiwan delegation at the GATT tariff 
consultations, while Thailand was represented by Puangrat 
Asavaphisisth, assistant director-general of business economy at 
the Ministry of Commerce. 
  During the one-day talks, Lin said, both sides agreed on 
tariff cuts for 40 items among the 38 agricultural goods and 20 
industrial products under discussions. 
  Taiwan agreed to lower import duties on the 40 items an 
average of 24 percent, Lin said. 
  Those items pending agreement include fruits such as mango, 
papaya, mangosteen, and rambutan as well as rice products, for 
which Thailand is seeking significant tariff reductions, he 
added. 
  Lin and his delegation, who earlier visited Manila, the 
Philippines and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for similar tariff talks, 
will return to Taipei Saturday. 
  Taiwan has held similar talks with the United States, 
Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South Korea, and Hungary. 
  Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are 
expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth entry into the 
Geneva-based world trade regulating body. 
  Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September 
1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.

  [Text] The Provincial Electricity Authority is planning 
for construction of two power projects at the Thai-Burmese 
border costing about Bt[baht]4 billion, its governor said over 
the weekend. 
  The first project involves hydro electricity with an 
investment of Bt2 billion. The other is an underground thermal 
project in Keng Tung, Burma, with an investment of Bt2 billion. 
New Zealand will participate in the latter project. 
  According to Chulaphong Chunlaket, governor of the 
Provincial 
Electricity Authority, the Thai authority recently agreed with 
Brig Gen Kyaw Win, representing the Burmese side, to jointly 
invest in a hydro-electricity plant at Mae Sai River costing Bt2 
billion, 70 per cent of which will come from the Thai side. 
  Chulaphong said that the authority will invite the private 
sector to provide up to Bt700 million or half the total Thai 
investment. 
  The hydro-power plant will produce 12 megawatts of 
electricity. The plant will supply two megawatts of electricity 
to Burma at Bt1.75 per unit. The remaining 10 megawatts will be 
distributed in Mae Sai district in Chiang Rai. 
  Chulaphong said that the Burmese side will provide labour 
and 
construction materials. He added that the Thai government does 
not need funding from the Asian Development Bank as private 
investment should be enough to fund the project. 
  The Mae Sai power project is one of seven projects looked at 
by the Thai-Burmese border committee. The other six are the 
Khlong Kra project, North Salween project, South Salween 
project, Moei projects I, II and III. 
  The Burmese side engaged EPDC [expansion unknown] of Japan 
to 
study the Mae Sai project one year ago. 
  Chulaphong said that Thailand has yet to fully study the 
Khlong Kra project, and it is expected that a feasibility study 
will be started after the study on the Mae Sai project is 
completed. 
  When the Mae Sai project runs at full capacity, it might 
have 
a capacity of 15 megawatts, Chulaphong added. 
  The second project is an underground thermal unit in Keng 
Tung, Burma, which is expected to have a capacity of 10 
megawatts. The project requires an investment of Bt2 billion. 
The Burmese side will own 30 per cent of it, the same as the 
Mae Sai project. 
  Chulaphong said that the second project is under 
negotiation, 
and the Provincial Electricity Authority has invited private 
companies from New Zealand to participate in the project.

  [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon Wongwanit has 
emphatically ruled out the possibility of another coup, saying 
only neurotics expect the military to seize power again. 
  "I can assure my fellow countrymen that there won't be 
another coup," Gen Wimon said yesterday. 
  "Those who always sniff up (rumors of) a coup must have a 
bad, non-functional nose. These neurotic people deserve all the 
derision and scorn of the public." 
  Wimon also urged the media to ignore "ignorant and 
unsupported" predictions of another coup. He was responding to 
an academic's comments that present political uncertainty could 
result in the military again stepping in. 
  Chalongphop Suksangkan, the director of the Thailand 
Development Research Institute, said on Wednesday he believed 
there could be another coup unless Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
dissolves the House of Representatives to defuse the political 
crisis. His widely-publicized comment was made at a seminar 
organized by the Board of Trade. 
  Chalongphop said the bombings in the South and the perceived 
poor performance of the government had hurt the economy and 
could lead to political tensions resulting in a coup. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told reporters at Government 
House yesterday that the likelihood of another coup was a 
non-issue and not worth discussing. 
  "I would like to ask those (who keep talking about the 
possibility of a coup): Are you doing this because you cannot 
hold your tongue, or because you want it to happen?" 
  A visibly annoyed Chuan said the public should help find 
ways 
to accelerate the country's democratization process rather than 
paying attention to "unproductive speculation." 
  "The country's democratization has come a long way. But the 
political development still is not fast enough for some groups 
of people," Chuan said. "My advice is don't give up hope. We 
are making steady progress." 
  Politicians and senior military officers said talking about 
a 
possible coup was counter-productive to the growth of democracy. 
Such talk would only damage Thailand's credibility in the eyes 
of the international community and scare away foreign investors.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Too Premature To Wrap Up Nakhon Si Thammarat </F>
Case"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Deputy Interior Minister Chamni Sakdiset 
announced that a woman was arrested in connection with an 
explosion at the Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station which 
killed three people and injured at least 27 others. 
  The woman arrested in Narathiwat allegedly confessed to 
setting off a grenade in order to kill an unfaithful lover after 
arranging to meet him at a noodle stall on the platform of the 
Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station. She told police the 
grenade had belonged to her ex-husband, a soldier. 
  Now it seems the authorities have decided to wrap up the 
case 
and are willing to rule out the possibility that saboteurs 
seeking to discredit the government were behind the blast. 
  It comes as no surprise that this woman has been arrested, 
because ever since the blast police officers including national 
police chief Pratin Santipraphop have said a "soured love 
affair" was behind the bombing. [sentence as published] Army 
chief Wimon Wongwanit also said "an affair" was behind the 
incident. 
  Whether the woman has been made a scapegoat or not is 
subject 
to debate. 
  Several lawyers have already threatened to file defamation 
suits against police officers who had claimed, allegedly without 
substantive evidence, that jealousy involving the noodle vendor 
was the motive behind the blast. The lawyers are representing 
Sutchai Butngam, the vendor who was one of the three killed and 
said to be involved in a love triangle. 
  Citing love triangles as reasons for bomb blasts in Thailand 
is nothing new for the police. In February last year, an 
ex-soldier was charged with murder after he confessed to sending 
a parcel bomb which exploded at the Samsen Noi post office, 
killing a postal officer and injuring five others. 
  The ex-soldier, according to police, intended the parcel 
bomb 
for a female department store employee after she had decided to 
end their relationship in order to marry another man. 
  The accused parcel bomber later claimed he was tortured by 
police into confessing to a crime he did not commit. 
  There is still a big question mark over whether a failed 
love 
affair was behind the Nakhon Si Thammarat blast. Political 
terrorism should not yet be ruled out as a factor behind last 
week's tragic incident. 
  If Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut or the government 
of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai are the targets, then we can 
expect to see more bombings. There is little doubt that many 
groups are out to discredit the Chuan government and are just 
waiting for its collapse so they can get back to business as 
usual. 
  Under no circumstances should we allow certain elements out 
to create anarchy in the country to jeopardize our hard-earned 
democracy. Intelligence gathering by the police and the Fourth 
Army Region based in the South has to be beefed up. As it is 
right now, there is a serious gap in the sharing of intelligence 
information between the police and military in the South. 
  Very often, the Fourth Army Region's intelligence network 
would be tipped off before certain events occurred. Somehow or 
another, for reasons best known to themselves, army intelligence 
is often reluctant to let their police counterparts -- who work 
with civilians -- in on the information. 
  When a criminal act keeps repeating itself at a certain 
frequency and innocent lives are lost, the authorities in charge 
of security have to be more responsible. 
  There are still many gaps in the Nakhon Si Thammarat bombing 
story and, unless there is watertight evidence, the case at this 
juncture should not be wrapped up by the authorities in the hope 
that the public would conveniently forget about it.

  [Text] Seven constitutional amendment bills sponsored by 
the government received less than half of the votes of the 625 
members of the National Assembly during a joint session, which 
was opened at 0955 today. The draft legislation therefore 
failed to pass its first reading. 
  In compliance with the suggestion of House Speaker Marut 
Bunnak, the alphabetic roll call was employed and members of the 
National Assembly were requested to vote on all the seven bills 
at one time. Normally, special legislation involving 
constitutional amendment bills would require separate voting, 
which in the case of the seven drafts would take about 10 hours. 
  The result of the voting was that the seven bills failed to 
get 313 votes or half of the votes from the 265 senators and 360 
members of the House of Representatives. The majority of the 
members of the National Assembly abstained from voting. The 
vote counting was completed at 1310. 
  In response to criticism of his job performance by some 
opposition members of the House, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
said it was a rather difficult task to try to please everyone, 
noting that the government had to be very careful in making 
decisions. He asked everyone to keep firmly to the democratic 
path, something which might not satisfy everybody. Things must 
proceed according to the procedures. He pointed out that the 
government not only had to serve the people, but also had to 
preserve the country's democratic system. 
  Members of the National Assembly stood up to hear the Royal 
Decree declaring the closure of the extraordinary session on 1 
May. 
  The ordinary parliamentary session will be opened on 1 May 
for a period of three months.

  [Text] Dear listeners: The second round of [peace] talks 
between the New Mon State Party [NMSP] and the SLORC [State Law 
and Order Restoration Council] was held at Moulmein. A 
Democratic Voice of Burma reporter sent the following report: 
  It has been learned that the NMSP delegation and the SLORC 
delegation held a second round of talks on 20, 25, and 28 March 
at Moulmein. The first round of talks were also held at 
Moulmein on 31 December 1993, 2 and 3 January 1994. The NMSP 
delegation was led by Nai Tun Aung with Nai Tin Aung, Nai Htay 
Myint, Nai Hla Win, and Nai Wai Lwin Aung as members; the SLORC 
delegation was led by Major General Ket Sein, commander of 
southeast military command, with Colonel Aung San, Lieutenant 
Colonel Myint Soe, Lt. Col. Soe Htay, Major Ye Myint, Brigadier 
General Kyaw Win, Col. Thein Swe, and Lt. Col. Kyaw Thein as 
members. 
  The NMSP held a meeting at Manerplaw on 25 April to explain 
about the talks. The ceremony was attended by leaders and 
members of the Democratic Alliance of Burma, the National League 
for Democracy -- Liberated Area, and other organizations in 
Manerplaw. The NMSP delegation explained that they raised 14 
points with the SLORC at the talks including a cease-fire and 
state border demarcation, solving political problems by 
political means, and to hold nationwide political talks. It has 
been learned that there were differences of opinion between the 
NMSP and the SLORC regarding the cease-fire and border 
demarcation matters.

  [Text] Mae Hong Son -- A major battle between the Muang Tai 
Army [MTA] and Burmese forces is looming on the Thai-Burmese 
border. Khun Sa sent more troops to reinforce MTA fighters 
confronting Burmese soldiers on the banks of the Salween River 
earlier this week. 
  The Burmese army has mobilised troops near the area occupied 
by Khun Sa since last month. The opium warlord said the battle 
was expected in the second week of May. 
  "The confrontation is at Ban Namchang, Namtu, Hsenwi, 
Namhkam, Mong Tang and Mong Gne which are located on the eastern 
side of the Salween," he said after a blessing ceremony for the 
reinforcements. 
  About 3,200 fighters from the army's 12 infantries attended 
the ceremony which lasted three hours on Tuesday. He said they 
were the well-trained. 
  "The Shan State has been encircled by the Burmese forces for 
four months. There was occasional fighting with 300 soldiers 
killed and a large number of injuries on both sides and we have 
to send more troops." 
  Khun Sa acknowledged that he had a 20,000 strong army. 
  "The MTA has no other choice but to fight till the end. If 
we don't defend ourselves, the Burmese forces will intrude on 
our territory. We have to push them back." 
  An American dressed in a military uniform was seen during 
the 
ceremony. Peter Bond, as identified by Khun Sa, was a former 
consultant of the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) who retired 
from the service. 
  "At one time, he treated me as drug kingpin. Now he just 
comes and has some meals with me," Khun Sa said. He refused to 
elaborate. 
  [One of four photographs accompanying article shows a 
Western 
man in military uniform. Caption reads: "An American 
identified as Peter Bond, in MTA uniform, is present at the 
ceremony to see off MTA soldiers. Drug warlord Khun Sa said 
Bond, 60, was formerly an adviser on narcotics affairs to the 
U.S. Government under President Jimmy Carter."]

  [Text] Homong, Burma -- Opium warlord Khun Sa said over the 
weekend he hoped to be able to declare the Shan State's 
independence from Burma in three years, and called for European 
support for his movement. 
  His associate, Chao Saengdeun Saengkham, also expressed hope 
that the group and its supporting Mong Tai Arny (MTA) would be 
able to extend its authority over a larger portion of Burma's 
northeastern Shan State within one to two years. He said they 
hope by then to be able to declare a govemment with the 
participation of seven other ethnic groups -- Akha, Lahu, 
Palaung, Pa-O, Tai, Tashin, and Wa. 
  Khun Sa was being interviewed by THE NATION at his 
headquarters in Homong. At the time he was seeing off about 
3,000 newly trained troops who were leaving for the frontlines 
to counter advancing Burmese forces approaching from the westem 
side of the Salween River. A few days earlier the MTA had 
dispatched other fighters to join about 2,000 MTA forces already 
operating on the other side of the river. An aide said the 
fresh troops would be sent to the Sino- Burmese border to 
encircle Burmese forces.

  [Text] Military authorities went on an emergency alert 
posture for about three hours on 30 April because of suspicious 
moves by North Korea in which some 20 North Korean fighter 
planes simultaneously moved southward from Pyongyang at around 
1415 [0515 GMT] today. Today's emergency alert posture against 
the North was ordered because North Korean fighter planes moved 
southward to Wonsan, Chinnampo, and Chukson from which these 
fighter planes can reach the skies of Seoul in five minutes. 
The ROK-U.S. Air Force operations command immediately declared 
the porcupine operation and went on alert. 
  The Defense Ministry said that it seems that this is a 
regular exercise by the North Korean Air Force, but since it is 
very rare to hold such an exercise on a Saturday, such an 
emergency alert posture was ordered.

  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam on Monday ordered an around-the-clock alert against 
North Korean military movements and harmonious policy-making 
under the new unification minister. 
  Kim issued the directives at a breakfast meeting with 
members 
of the Unification-National Security Policy Coordination Council 
that was established on his orders last month, his senior aide 
Chong Chong-ok said. 
  He asked the military to be on constant alert against events 
like an increase in the frequency of North Korean military 
exercises, while emphasizing that the council should seek to 
formulate policies in unison under new Deputy 
Premier-Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku. 
  One inside source described what he said were North Korea's 
attempts to disband the Military Armistice Commission (MAC). 
  North Korean members to the MAC Secretariat had been on 
resident duty but Pyongyang withdrew them as of April 29, the 
source said, an indication that it is trying to nullify the 
commission all together. 
  The source saw the move as part of Pyongyang's insistence to 
the United States that the Armistice Agreement of 1953 should be 
replaced by a peace treaty. 
  This source also reminded of an unexpected military exercise 
on April 30 when 15 to 20 North Korean air force planes took off 
from Pyongyang and flew as far down South as near the 
demarcation line. 
  The president added that the council must try to regain the 
public's trust by demonstrating unity and cooperation. 
  Monday's breakfast meeting was the first gathering of the 
council members since Yi took office last Saturday. 
  The members shared their views on pending issues, including 
the North Korean nuclear dispute and resettlement of North 
Korean escapees from Siberian logging camps.

  [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- New Deputy Prime 
Minister and National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku said 
Saturday the joint Seoul-Pyongyang declaration for 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula must be realized by all 
means, as all the Korean people want a nuclear-free Korean 
peninsula. 
  Meeting the press after his inaugural ceremony, he observed 
North Korea will eventually give up its nuclear arms development 
program, adding, "The program cannot be justified under any 
circumstances." 
  Stressing the need for a firm and consistent policy toward 
North Korea, Yi said, however, that he would make a flexible 
approach to pending issues, taking into consideration the 
situation of each issue. 
  Asked about the issue of North Korean loggers in Siberia, he 
replied, "I think the government should make a comprehensive 
policy as soon as possible after considering its legal and 
diplomatic aspects.

  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is cordoning 
off a special economic zone with barbed wire and check points, 
apparently isolating the area to prevent contact between 
foreigners and locals, official and business sources here said 
Monday. 
  The Stalinist state has sped up production of steel wire and 
is ordering more from China and Southeast Asian countries to 
encircle the 746-square-kilometer "Najin-Sonbong" zone, 
according to the sources. 
  Pyongyang elevated the zone last year to Najin-Sonbong city 
and added more land to enlarge the area from 621 square 
kilometers to 746 square kilometers in an ambitious move to 
attract foreign companies and investment. 
  The recent attempt to isolate the zone is another concrete 
measure to expedite the process while preventing negative 
repercussions that might force an opening of North Korean 
society or the introduction of foreign culture, the sources said. 
  They added that North Korea is busy obtaining all available 
barbed wire and has asked for a possible South Korean supply 
through third countries.

  [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean family of 
five will arrive at Kimpo International Airport Saturday 
afternoon after defecting via a third country in Southeast Asia, 
the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] said Saturday. 
  Yu Man-chol, 48, of Hamhung, South Hamgyong Province, fled 
North Korea with his wife, two sons and one daughter. 
  Yu has worked as a driver in Hamhung, NSP officials said. 
  Earlier, Kim Man-chol deserted North Korea with 10 family 
members in February 1987 and defected to South Korea via Japan 
and Taiwan. 
  Yu, formerly a captain of the North Korean Public Security 
Ministry, and his family will have a press conference Monday 
afternoon at the press center.

  [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- A five-member North 
Korean family, headed by Yo Man-chol, 48, who defected from 
North Korea in mid-March, arrived here by air from Hong Kong 
Saturday afternoon. 
  "We decided to flee because it was very hard to make a 
living 
there," said Yo upon arrival, "and we're very pleased to have 
arrived in South Korea because our dream of defecting to the 
South has now come true." 
  He said he had been a captain of the Public Security 
Ministry 
before he worked as a driver just before his defection. 
  On March 18, he and his family fled to China, crossing the 
frozen Yalu River, and then moved to southern China by train. 
"In China, we had much help from ethnic Koreans," he said. But 
he declined to comment on where they visited in China and when, 
where and how they got in touch with the South Korean Government. 
  Yo arrived with his family members, wife, Yi Ok-kum, 45: Two 
sons, Kumyong, 18, and Unyong, 16: and daughter, Kumju, 20. 
  The Yo were the second North Korean family who defected to 
the South after the Kim Man-chol family who fled to South Korea 
via Japan and Taiwan in February 1987.

  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- A North Korea family of 
five who in defection arrived in Seoul last Saturday said on 
Monday that people in the North suffer heavily from food 
shortage as food ration has been virtually suspended since 
August last year. 
  Yo Man-chol, age 48, told a press conference at the Seoul 
Press Center that he and his family had escaped North Korea 
partly because of food shortage and partly because his family 
had been treated unfavorably after he was removed from the 
Public Security Ministry in 1989. 
  Yo said he was working as a guidance officer with the rank 
of 
captain at Hamhung City office of the Public Security Ministry 
when he was sacked after his acceptance of money from a traffic 
violator was uncovered. 
  He said he and his family fled North Korea into northern 
China through the frozen Yalu River on last March 18. 
  "Once in China, we moved to southern China by train and 
could 
come to South Korea through a third country with the help of an 
ethnic Korean in China," Yo said. 
  His wife, Yi Ok-kum, 45, who had worked as a kindergarten 
master in Hamhung, said they had to live mainly on corn since 
last August when food ration came to a virtual halt. 
  "We were so hungry that I had to go to the countryside and 
beg my sister and brother there for some grains," she said in 
tear. 
  Saying "the food situation in the North is worse than you 
may 
presume," Mr. Yo stated that mainly because of the food problem, 
the North Koreans' loyalty to Kim Il-song and his son, Kim 
Chong-il, had visibly declined. 
  In the past, he said, almost all people attending public 
events wore Kim Il-song badges. "Nowadays Kim Il-song badges can 
be seen on the chest of only about 20 percent of attendees," he 
said. 
  Yo said his listening to South Korean radio programs had 
helped him decide to defect to South Korea. 
  When North Korea sells radios to people, all channels except 
North Korean stations, are sealed off with soldering, Yo said, 
adding that lately many people break the seal to clandestinely 
listen to South Korean programs as he himself did. 
  Asked if she readily agreed to her father's suggestion for 
escape, Yo Kum-ju, age 20, a kindergarten teacher, said that at 
first she resisted the offer because she did not want to be a 
"traitor." 
  "But, I changed my mind later after listening to South 
Korean 
broadcasts with a radio my father gave me," she said. 
  The two other family members were Yo Kum-yong, 18, a middle 
school sixth grader, and his younger brother, Un-yong, 16, a 
middle school fourth grader.

<F P=106> [Report by Chin Chang-nip from Washington] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Government stated it would oppose the 
replacement of fuel rods at nuclear reactors in Yongbyon, North 
Korea. This indicates that the U.S. nuclear policy toward North 
Korea has changed considerably, which attracts the people's 
attention. 
  Such a position by the U.S. Government has been disclosed on 
many occasions, but it did not attract attention because it was 
expressed ambiguously. Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant 
secretary of State, has recently expressed the U.S. position 
clearly and concretely. 
  The U.S. Government has clearly expressed its position 
opposing the replacement of fuel rods at North Korean nuclear 
reactors because, although the United States has been continuing 
negotiations with North Korea for the past ten months to freeze 
North Korea's nuclear development, it believes North Korea would 
continue developing nuclear weapons. Therefore, it seems the 
United States has decided to prevent North Korea from replacing 
fuel rods in order to block its nuclear development. 
  After the second round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks 
in Geneva on 19 July 1993, Robert Gallucci said that he would 
oppose North Korea's extraction of plutonium. Also, U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry recently said that we must 
not allow North Korea to extract plutonium again by replacing 
nuclear fuel at the nuclear reactors. 
  In U.S.-North Korean unofficial contacts slated for either 
28 
or 29 April in New York, the U.S. Government is likely to convey 
its position to North Korea that it withdraws the demand for the 
exchange of special envoys between the North and South, and that 
it opposes North Korea's replacing fuel rods at its nuclear 
reactors. It is very significant militarily that the United 
States has informed North Korea of its intention to oppose the 
replacing of fuel rods at nuclear reactors. 
  When nuclear fuel is replaced, the operation of the nuclear 
reactors are suspended. After the reactor core cools down, the 
used fuel is removed when the fuel rods are replaced. 
  The United States has so far considered carrying out a 
preventive strike against North Korean nuclear facilities if its 
diplomatic efforts to settle the nuclear issue fail, but has 
stated that there are many difficulties because a strike against 
active nuclear reactors would cause the vast proliferation of 
radiation.

    [Editorial Report] Three Seoul vernacular newspapers on 30 
April carry editorials and reports on North Korea's proposal to 
replace the armistice agreement with a peace treaty with the 
United States. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "The Pitfall of a Peace Treaty." Referring 
to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea as North 
Korea's main goal in nuclear negotiations with the United 
States, the editorial says, "the North Korean Foreign Ministry 
proposed to the United States that it would hold talks to 
discuss the replacement of an armistice agreement with a peace 
treaty." 
  The editorial adds, "North Korea shows its move to actually 
link the peace treaty with the settlement of the North Korean 
nuclear issue," referring to remarks made by a high-level North 
Korean diplomat at his new conference regarding replacing the 
armistice agreement with a peace treaty to solve the nuclear 
issue. 
  Noting the U.S. Government's refusal of North Korea's 
proposal the editorial says, "it is, however, questionable 
whether the United States will continue to hold its present 
position in case North Korea concretely proposes to sign the 
peace treaty, while promising to resolve the nuclear issue." 
  Referring to the background of North Korea's nuclear 
development, the editorial says, "North Korean politicians are 
likely to believe that nuclear weapons can be an economical and 
effective means to guarantee their security, and that their 
possession of nuclear weapons can delay U.S. intervention in the 
case of an emergency situation on the Korean peninsula or, 
ultimately, promote the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South 
Korea." 
  Referring to the U.S. forces in South Korea as the main 
obstacle to North Korea's strategy for national reunification, 
the editorial says that in the next round of U.S.-North Korean, 
North Korea will more persistently push ahead with its strategy 
to replace the armistice agreement with a peace treaty. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO on page 5 carries a 1,000-word 
article by reporters Kang Yong-chin and Yu Yong-ku entitled 
"Progress in North-South Relations Is the Key To Resolve the 
North Korean Nuclear Issue." Referring to the U.S. Government's 
new proposal to North Korea at the recent U.S.-North Korean 
working-level contacts in New York, the report says, "this 
indicates that North-South dialogue should be simultaneously 
carried out with the third round of U.S.- North Korean 
high-level talks in order to resolve the nuclear issue." 
  Noting the contents of the U.S. Government's new proposals 
indicating that it will decide on the suspension of the Team 
Spirit joint military exercise only if progress has been made in 
North- South dialogue, the report says the United States seems 
to believe that the North Korean nuclear issue cannot be 
ultimately resolved if no progress has been made in North-South 
dialogue. 
  Referring to the U.S. Government's "emphasis" on North-South 
dialogue in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and to 
North Korea's proposal to replace the armistice agreement with a 
peace treaty, the report says, "there is a difference between 
the two countries' proposals: That is, North Korea has put 
forward an additional proposal, which has nothing to do with the 
settlement of the nuclear issue, while the United States has 
concentrated every effort to resolving the issue." 
  Referring to the possibility that the U.S. Government will 
improve relations with North Korea to resolve the nuclear issue 
and to North Korea's using the nuclear issue card as leverage to 
maintain its system and to promote its economy, the report says, 
"it is, therefore, possible that such proposals by the U.S. 
Government may create a more complicated situation in resolving 
the nuclear issue." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO on page 2 carries a 200-word report 
entitled "The United States Has Expressed a Negative Attitude 
Toward North Korea's Proposal for the Replacement of the 
Armistice Agreement With a Peace Treaty." Referring to the U.S. 
Government's negative position on the North Korean proposal, the 
report says (Christine Shelly), vice spokeswoman of the U.S. 
Department of State, said that the armistice agreement is still 
in effect and that the U.S. is not aware of any moves concerning 
North Korean military deployment and that in dialogue with North 
Korea, the U.S. has "clearly taken necessary steps to hold the 
third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks." 
  The report concludes, "the spokeswoman stressed that she 
does 
not believe that there is any direct relation between the 
armistice agreement and the North Korean nuclear issue."

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- Former U.S. President 
George Bush said Monday at the opening ceremony of the 
Pacific-Asia Travel Association (PATA) annual conference that 
tourism is a high-growth industry which contributes greatly to 
global economic development and peace. Bush said the tourism 
industry is vital because it can play a leading role in 
resolving regional conflicts. He also mentioned the importance 
of PATA, which admitted Vietnam and South Africa as new members 
this year, saying the body provides a new communication channel 
for countries across the world. 
  Touching on the North Korean nuclear dispute, he said China 
will play an important role in solving the problem and thus 
should not be driven into a corner. 
  Bush was invited to the conference after appearing in a 
television commercial inviting foreigners to visit the United 
States. He arrived on Saturday and met with President Kim 
Yong-sam and former President No Tae-u later in the day.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia 
can arrange resettlement of North Korean loggers from Siberia 
independently without intervention by U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Monday. 
  "Bilateral cooperation may be sufficient for those who have 
clearly indicated they choose to come to Seoul on their own free 
will," Han said at a press conference after arriving from Moscow. 
  His remarks signify a change in Seoul's earlier position 
that 
the government will seek intervention by the UNHCR to prevent 
possible claims by Pyongyang that South Korea is kidnapping the 
loggers. An estimated 500 North Koreans are said to be in flight 
throughout Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), seeking 
resettlement mostly in South Korea. 
  "Not all of these estimated people are North Korean loggers, 
but people who have fled North Korea through other means," said 
Han. North Korean loggers have escaped their Siberian camps in 
droves, later testifying to rampant human rights violation 
inside the camps. 
  Han had discussed this issue at length with Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev during his Moscow visit. "Russia has 
promised full cooperation, saying it has not and will not send 
back the loggers to North Korea," said Han. 
  UNHCR support and mediation would become necessary for 
protecting the escapees who have not yet being able to contact 
the South Korean embassy in Moscow and need protection. 
  There are various ways to bring the loggers to South Korea, 
such as having Moscow issue them residential permit and later 
allowing them to emigrate to Seoul. The South Korean Embassy 
could issue them travel permits or passports and recognize them 
officially as South Korean citizens, Han said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 1 (YONHAP) -- North Korean leader Kim 
Il-song is expected to visit China in May, a diplomatic source 
here said on Sunday. 
  China had invited Kim to talk with him about the North 
Korean 
nuclear problem and ways for China to help North Korea which is 
suffering from economic difficulties, according to the source. 
  He quoted Chinese Premier Li Peng as having said to South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam during his visit to China in last 
March that China had asked for Kim Il-song's visit to China. 
  But North Korea judged that it is untimely for Kim Il-song 
to 
visit China shortly after South Korean President Kim visited 
Beijing, Li was quoted as saying. 
  Li expected that the North Korean president would visit 
China 
in an appropriate time. 
  The source said, "the Chinese Government recently sent a 
senior military official to Pyongyang to persuade on North 
Korean officials to give up alleged nuclear development. I 
understand that Kim Il- song's visit to China is being pushed 
for in this context." 
  Meanwhile, China asked South Korea to postpone the visit of 
Mun Chung-su, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party (DLP), to China because of the Kim Il-song's visit, the 
source said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's trade with 
northern and communist nations is soaring, the national 
statistical office said Thursday. 
  Exports to the seven nations including China and Russia rose 
101.5 percent from 3,430 million U.S. dollars in 1992 to 6,910 
million dollars last year, while imports from these countries 
increased 28.6 percent to 5,120 million dollars in the same 
period. 
  The trade balance, accordingly, changed from a 550-million- 
dollar deficit in 1992 to a surplus of 1,790 million dollars, 
the office said. The other five nations are Vietnam, Poland, 
Hungary, Romania and Ukraine. 
  Shipments to these countries accounted for 8.4 percent of 
total South Korean exports in 1993, compared to 4.5 percent in 
1992, while imports from the seven states climbed from 4.9 
percent in 1992 to 6.1 percent of total imports last year. 
  Exports to China skyrocketed 94.1 percent to 5,150 million 
dollars last year, and imports from that nation gained 5.5 
percent to 3,930 million dollars. Iron and steel led Korea's 
exports with 998 million dollars, followed by automobiles with 
582 million dollars. 
  The trade balance with China went from 1,070 million dollars 
in the red in 1992 to 1,220 million dollars in the black last 
year. 
  Exports to Russia rose 510 percent to 601 million dollars 
during the same period, while imports from that country soared 
1,300 percent to 975 million dollars. Iron and steel led the 
South Korean imports with 356 million dollars.

  [Text] The No. 2 Songgwang-ho, a trawler from Pusan--which 
was fishing at the East China Sea, 220 miles southwest off Cheju 
Island's Mosulpo--and 11 of its crewmen, including 44-year-old 
Captain Sin Hyon-pok, were captured by a Chinese patrol boat at 
around 1200 [0300 GMT] on 29 April. 
  Also at the same time on 29 April, the No. 27 Taehung-ho, a 
120-tonne class trawler from Pusan--which was carrying out 
repair work at sea 175 miles southwest off Cheju Island's 
Mosulpo-- drifted toward the Chinese territorial waters because 
of the undercurrent. Thus, this trawler and 11 of its crewmen, 
including 41-year-old Captain Tak Hung-yang, were also 
intercepted by the Chinese patrol boat. 
  Fishermen of the No. 1 Songgwang ship, who were fishing near 
the seized No. 2 Songgwang ship, said that when they followed 
the No. 2 Songgwang ship after seeing that it was being detained 
by the Chinese patrol boat, which appeared suddenly, the Chinese 
patrol boat cut the ropes connecting the tugboat and apprehended 
the crewmen.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (YONHAP) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam stressed Thursday that close relations among Korea, 
the United States and Japan are essential in resolving the North 
Korean nuclear dispute. 
  "For this reason, I hope the political state of Japan 
stabilizes as soon as possible," Kim said in an interview with 
the ASAHI SHIMBUN at Chongwadae (the presidential office) in 
Seoul. 
  China firmly opposes North Korea's possession of nuclear 
arms, Kim said, citing talks with Jiang Zemin during his visit 
to Beijing last month. 
  Noting the military threat posed by North Korea cannot be 
overlooked, he said Seoul and Washington are prepared to act 
under any circumstances. 
  However, he told the Japanese vernacular daily that there 
are 
no signs of an imminent North Korean attack. 
  "The foreign media's reporting on tension on the Korean 
peninsula is too exaggerated to some extent," he added. 
  Kim said Washington would not make a decision on the North 
Korean nuclear issue and announce it without consulting him 
first. 
  He said he anticipated substantial results at the upcoming 
North Korean-U.S. working-level negotiations. 
  "North Korea wants better relations with the United States 
to 
escape from its economic straits, but the United States is 
unlikely to agree unless full nuclear inspections are complied 
with," he told ASAHI. 
  He noted that China can influence North Korea more than any 
other country but does not want to unnecessarily provoke its 
communist ally. 
  "But China holds the firm position that North Korea 
absolutely should not have nuclear arms and I think its stance 
is stronger than any other country in the world," he said. 
  Kim said he hoped to see the Japanese political situation 
soon return to normal as the Seoul-Washington-Tokyo front was 
very important in blocking North Korea's nuclear program. 
  During his summit in Toyko last month, Kim said, former 
Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had told him that Japan did not wish 
to seek a permanent seat on the UN Security Council at present, 
but would support Seoul's bid for a non-permanent seat in 1996. 
  He predicted that North Korean leader Kim Il-song was 
unlikely to attend the United Nations General Assembly session 
in New York this fall. 
  "Time is on our side, not on North Korea's side. I believe 
an inter-Korean summit will take place naturally some day," he 
said, adding that Seoul would not approach Pyongyang first.

  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam had a 20-minute telephone 
conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Hata this morning in 
which the two leaders agreed to maintain the existing joint 
cooperation system between the ROK, the United States, and Japan. 
  President Kim telephoned Prime Minister Hata from Chongwadae 
[presidential residence] today. Congratulating the latter on 
assuming office as prime minister, President Kim stressed that 
the stability of Japanese politics is beneficial to the ROK and 
Asia as a whole. President Kim hoped that Prime Minister Hata's 
trip to Europe, which begins tomorrow, will be smooth. 
  In reply, Prime Minister Hata said that in dealing with the 
North Korean nuclear issue, it is necessary to maintain a firm 
attitude while leaving a window open for dialogue. Prime 
Minister Hata said that Japan will continue to maintain the 
cooperation system built between the two countries through the 
two rounds of summit talks during Former Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's administration. 
  The leaders of the two countries agreed to cooperate closely 
by telephone whenever necessary in the future as well.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- Japanese tourist 
arrivals are soaring this year, the Korea National Tourism Corp. 
(KNTC) said Monday. 
  In the first quarter 387,000 Japanese visited South Korea, a 
38-percent increase over the same period last year. 
  The number of Japanese tourists stood at 100,000 in January, 
up 25 percent, at 120,000 in February, up 32 percent, and at 
167,000 in march, up 53 percent. 
  Japanese tourist arrivals are expected to climb further in 
the future, especially during the golden holidays of April 
27-May 7 when nearly 55,000 Japanese are likely to come, a 
22.2-percent rise, Japanese tourism sources said. 
  The surge is due to visa exemptions for Japanese during 
"Visit Korea Year '94," the sources said. 
  The KNTC expects nearly 4 million foreigners to come this 
year, with Japanese accounting for half of the figure.

  [Text] Korea yesterday entered into a string of quarterly 
bilateral negotiations with Australia, New Zealand and the 
United States to discuss matters concerning Korea's beef imports. 
  The meetings are the third of their kind since a memorandum 
of understanding on beef market access was signed between Korea 
and Korea's three major beef exporters last July, the Ministry 
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said. 
  In yesterday's meeting, Australia urged Korea to expand the 
volume of its grass-fed beef sold in wholesale markets to 5,000 
tons from the present 800 tons, said a ministry official who 
attended the meeting. 
  New Zealand is expected to make similar demands in a meeting 
with Korea scheduled for April 25, the official said. 
  The United States with which Korea is scheduled to have a 
beef negotiation April 26 will likely urge Korea to ease 
restrictions on the local distribution of beef.

  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and 
Australia met Monday for their quarterly beef talks, but failed 
to strike a deal due to disagreements over the volume listed in 
the wholesale market and carry-over of excess imports. 
  Seoul proposed to increase the listed volume of common meat 
at the wholesale market to 1,000 tons this year from 1993's 800 
tons, but canberra was opposed, calling the amount too small 
compared with this year's beef imports of 106,000 tons. 
  Australia again refused Korea's request to have the volume 
exceeding the import quota be carried forward to next year 
because it predicted actual imports to be more than the 
designated quota in view of current consumption. 
  The two will take up the issue at the next quarterly 
meeting.

<F P=106> [Interview with new ROK Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok by KBS </F>
anchorman Kim Kwang-il on 30 April; place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Kim Kwang-il] In an interview with KBS today, new 
ROK Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok revealed that the future 
direction of the government's administration is reform amid 
harmony. We will listen further to Prime Minister Yi's view on 
his appointment and the direction of the government's 
administration. 
  [Begin recording] [Kim] How are you? 
  [Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok] Hello. 
  [Kim] First of all, I would like to congratulate you on your 
appointment. 
  [Yi] Thank you very much. 
  [Kim] You have been entrusted with a heavy duty of leading 
the third-term cabinet of the civilian-rule government. What is 
your impression of your appointment? 
  [Yi] Since I have been entrusted with an important duty 
during a difficult period, I, who am lacking in every way, have 
a heavy heart. 
  [Kim] One of the tasks which the civilian-rule government 
must continue to promote is reform. What do you think that the 
third- term cabinet must urgently do to continuously promote 
reform? 
  [Yi] I will work to emphasize harmony by gathering all kinds 
of different and creative opinions into one unified opinion. We 
must achieve reform through harmony. 
  [Kim] In the past you were the deputy prime minister in 
charge of South-North diplomacy and security-related issues and 
presided over coordination meetings for reunification and 
security-related policies. Now you have become the prime 
minister, are you thinking of continuing to be in charge of 
diplomacy and security-related issues? 
  [Yi] I have experience in this field, but the coordination 
meetings for reunification and security-related policies are 
held centering on the deputy prime minister in charge of 
national unification. It has operated in such a way for about a 
month. I believe that it is ideal for the joint work in the 
process of establishing, coordinating, and promoting a policy. 
  [Kim] You have been known to be a conservative figure. Some 
people even pointed out that you are not fit for carrying out 
reform. What is your opinion on this matter? 
  [Yi] People who have a practical knowledge about the true 
nature of North Korea regard that North Korea can be our partner 
only when reunification is achieved together, and at the same 
time they say that we should find a way for reunification with 
the North by taking a prudent attitude and being cautious of the 
danger of North Korea's line toward the South. This kind of 
people are saying that I am a conservative. I think this matter 
is related to who has a more correct understanding of reality. I 
believe that I am very knowledgeable about North Korea because I 
have visited North Korea for talks, have thought about this 
matter over a long period of time, have had many experiences, 
and read many books on it. Therefore, I think I am a practical 
rationalist. 
  [Kim] Thank you for the interview. 
  [Yi] You are welcome. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles published in Seoul vernacular newspapers on 2 May on 
the nature and characteristic of the new diplomacy-security team 
in the ROK Government and on the prospect of their policies. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word 
article by reporter Kim Cha-su, under the headline, "What are 
the contents of the policies to be implemented by the new 
security team?" The article points out that the very "difficult" 
impending problems facing the new diplomacy-security team are 
the North Korean nuclear problem, the North Korean escapees from 
logging sites in Siberia, and the important task of deciding 
"the method and form" of North- South dialogue to be held in the 
future. The article notes, however, that the government's 
position is that it will not "unilaterally decide" the form of 
dialogue, but will make the decision after "sounding out" North 
Korean intent through the United States, which began holding 
working-level contacts with North Korea in New York. The article 
predicts that the issue to which the government will pay primary 
attention to is the resumption of the North-South Joint Nuclear 
Control Committee and to review the possibility of resuming 
contact between delegates to North-South high-level talks. 
Concerning the time of resuming dialogue, the government 
stresses that the North Korean side should be the "first to 
propose" dialogue because North-South dialogue should be resumed 
without fail before a third round of North Korean-U.S. talks, 
which North Korea "eagerly desires." 
  The article notes that the new diplomacy-security team will 
review the issue of North Korean escapees from logging sites in 
Russia wishing to defect to the South, adding that the 
government will not decide "hastily" but will "calmly" resolve 
the issue because the Russian Government complained over the 
"hastiness" of the ROK Government and stressed appropriate 
"legal procedure" be used in handling the loggers. Pointing to 
North Korea's "strong rejection," the article notes that the 
government decided to reveal its position to handle the issue of 
North Korean loggers from the viewpoint of a "human rights 
issue" of compatriots. 
  The new diplomacy-security team will work out "measures" to 
cope with the North Korean proposal for changing the Armistice 
Agreement into a peace agreement but, the article writes, the 
government has had no "effective means" to counter such a 
"propaganda offensive" by the North, except the principle of 
solving the problem by "the parties concerned in the North and 
the South." Thus, the team will again "intensively study" the 
plan to "annul" the Armistice Agreement "after" building a peace 
system according to the North- South Agreement, as well as other 
issues that have been discussed within the government. It is 
highly likely that to answer the people's comment that previous 
policies on the North Korean nuclear issue and other diplomacy 
and security-related issues "lack consistency," the new team 
will "intensively review" means to make "one harmonized voice." 
  The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 2 a 
1,600-word article by reporter Ko Tae-song entitled, "Prospect 
for New Policies by Diplomacy-Security Team Headed by Deputy 
Prime Minister Yi." 
  Describing new Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku as a widely 
recognized "expert in reunification and diplomatic affairs," the 
article predicts "no drastic change" in the diplomatic and 
security policy pursued by former Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Yong-tok. The article, however, notes that there will be "some 
changes" in details in implementation methods. The task 
presently facing the team after withdrawal of the North-South 
envoy exchange-first policy is the North Korean nuclear issue, 
which is advancing in "a new direction." The article assumes 
that the new team will "refrain" from "impulsive [kamjongchok] 
means" in solving the North nuclear issue but will seek 
"reasonable ways" that represent new Deputy Prime Minister Yi's 
work style and that represent the position of Foreign Minister 
Han. Observing that the new team will have to take "considerable 
pains" in deciding "when" and "in what degree" it should propose 
resumption of North-South dialogue in the course of dealing with 
the North Korean nuclear problem, the article writes that new 
Deputy Prime Minister Yi stressed "implementation" of the 
North-South agreement and joint denulcearization declaration, 
and notes his position expresses "the will" not to be 
"alienated" from resolving the nuclear issue. 
  Another issue for the new team to deal with is "accepting" 
the North Korean escapees from logging sites in Russia for 
settlement in the ROK. The article predicts that the new team 
will try to resolve this issue in a "quiet" manner without 
"irritating" China, Russia, and North Korea by carefully 
reviewing and discussing it with relevant government offices. 
The new team will "effectively operate" the recently formulated 
"Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council" in its 
future endeavors. 
  The pro-government daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on page 2 a 
1,200-word article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon, under the 
headline, "The new reunification-diplomacy team will seek 
middle, moderate- progressive policy on North Korea." The 
article notes that the new reunification-diplomacy team will 
attach great importance to the "international cooperative 
system" and "dialogue" in resolving the North Korean nuclear 
issue, and stresses that the attempt to define the new security 
team only as "conservative" or "progressive" is "unreasonable." 
The article concludes that although key members of this team 
have some personal preferences in playing their roles, the 
team's overall "team work" will work effectively.

  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party [DLP] plans to take over from the presidential 
office [Chongwadae] in handling future political disputes with 
the main opposition Democratic Party, DLP sources said Monday. 
  President Kim Yong-sam's administration has recently been at 
odds with the opposition party over such issues as the 
resignation of Former Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and the 
Sangmudae scandal. 
  Since the inauguration of the civilian government last 
February, the ruling party has needed the strong leadership of 
Kim Yong-sam, who also serves as DLP president, in carrying out 
reform and purging corrupt officials. 
  But now, Chongwadae believes that stable execution of 
government affairs should be given top priority. 
  In order to maintain better relations between the ruling and 
opposition parties, the presidential office has therefore 
decided to let the DLP take the initiative in handling political 
affairs. 
  Under the new idea, the ruling party hopes to strengthen 
inter- party dialogue and remain in close contact with the 
opposition party through their floor leaders at the National 
Assembly, as well as through their secretaries-general and 
policy-makers. 
  DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil, speaking at a regular monthly 
meeting of senior party officials, pointed out that the ruling 
party exists because there is an opposition and vice versa. 
  "Although there is a gap, the Democratic Party has to be an 
essential partner (for the DLP)," Kim said. 
  "We should do our best to maintain healthy relations with 
the 
opposition party," he added. "We should keep building 
partnership relations with it." 
  DLP Secretary-General Mun Chung-su said that whenever the 
opposition launched an offensive in the past, Chongwadae 
hastened to handle it, assuming a greater burden. Mun thus 
signaled a change and the party's intention to grab the 
initiative in political affairs from now on. 
  Another senior DLP official said that Chongwadae is studying 
ways to leave party affairs to the DLP and administrative work 
to the cabinet. 
  In view of this new policy direction, the DLP is expected to 
offer a "cooling-off period" before opening formal and informal 
channels of dialogue with the opposition party, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- A cabinet meeting on 
Monday approved the plans of four central government offices to 
reduce their authorized manpower strength by 63. The four 
offices were the Justice, Transportation and Information 
Ministries, and the Maritime and Port Administration. 
  The reduction included 24 at the Transportation Ministry, 13 
at Information Ministry, and 21 at the Maritime and Port 
Administration. Monday's reduction brings to 364 the total of 
personnel slashed by 14 central government offices thus far. 
  A source said the Defense Ministry and 12 other offices have 
prepared manpower reduction plans of their own but are yet to 
furnish them to the Government Administration Ministry. 
  Six other offices including the National Unification Board, 
Office of Legislation, and the Patriots and Veterans Affairs 
Ministry have failed to work out reduction plans as yet, the 
source said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's imports 
far outpaced exports during the first quarter of this year to 
record trade deficits of 2,581 million dollars. According to the 
Finance Ministry on Monday, exports reached 19,954 million 
dollars in the January-March period, a gain of 9.8 percent over 
the same period of last year, while imports totaled 22,535 
million dollars, a rise of 12.9 percent. 
  The sharp increase of imports was because introduction of 
capital and consumption goods and raw materials has been rising 
at a rapid pace influenced by the beginning of business recovery 
in the country.In the period, exports were led by heavy and 
chemical industrial goods, whose exports jumped 13.9 percent 
over a year before and accounted for 65.8 percent of the total 
exports. Light industrial goods exports gained only 3.0 percent 
in the three months. 
  By area, exports to China rose by 18.7 percent over the like 
period of last year, to ASEAN countries by 10.6 percent, to EC 
by 11.5 percent, to Japan by 12.5 percent and to the United 
States by 4.6 percent.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Komago] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 22 Apr -- In an interview with a NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative 
[Charlene] Barshevsky, said, "There will be no change in U.S. 
policy toward Japan despite a change of government in Japan" and 
denied reports that the U.S. Government will soften its tough 
trade stand on Japan. With regard to the question of resuming 
the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, she stated: 
"During his meeting with Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor set some 
conditions for resuming the stalled framework talks and Mr. Hata 
told Mr. Kantor that he would study the conditions after 
returning to Japan. We are waiting for answers from Tokyo." She 
added, "If there are no answers from Japan, it would be 
difficult to hold informal consultations with it to discuss ways 
to resume the stalled framework talks." During the interview, 
she also indicated that the U.S. Government will make a judgment 
on whether Japan has honored the Japan-U.S. agreement on 
government procurement in late April and work steadily to settle 
the issue of individual sectors with Japan regardless of whether 
the framework talks resume or not. 
  In the interview, she stressed that, in order for the 
framework talks to be resumed, "Japan's measures for the 
macroeconomic policy and the individual sectors are equally 
important." As for the ratio of Japan's current account surplus 
to Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) in the macroeconomic 
policy, she said, "The U.S. Government has already asked the 
Japanese Government to present not only a ratio for 1994, but a 
medium-term ratio." 
  Commenting on the reports that the United States will soften 
its tough trade stand on Japan following a change of government 
in Japan, the U.S. trade official denied the reports, saying, 
"They are wrong." Also commenting on the Hata-Kantor meeting, 
she stated: "They failed to reach an agreement on how to 
implement what both Japan and the United States agreed last July 
and confirmed that the two countries are not in a situation to 
hold informal consultations to discuss ways to reopen the 
stalled framework talks." 
  In the interview, she disclosed for the first time that 
"during his meeting with Mr. Kantor, Foreign Minister Hata told 
Mr. Kantor that he will study the conditions offered by Mr. 
Kantor for the resumption of the stalled framework talks after 
returning to Tokyo," adding that "we are waiting for answers 
from Tokyo." During his meeting with Foreign Minister Hata in 
Morocco, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor set three conditions 
for resuming the stalled framework talks which included: 1) 
macroeconomic policy that serves to cut Japan's huge trade 
surplus; 2) expansion of Japan's imports; and 3) establishment 
of an objective criteria to measure openness of the Japanese 
market by individual sector. 
  During the interview, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative 
Barshevsky indicated that Japan needs to respond flexibly to all 
the three conditions, and the United States places importance on 
both the macroeconomic policy and the establishment of an 
objective criteria as its conditions for resuming the stalled 
framework talks. She stressed in the interview the importance of 
the objective criteria and of preventing a misunderstanding from 
spreading in Japan that the stalled framework talks can be 
resumed only if Japan works out the macroeconomic policy, 
taking into account Under Secretary of Treasure Summers' remark 
that "the marcroeconomic policy is most effective in reducing 
Japan's trade surplus."

<F P=106> ["Summary" of remarks during interview with Deputy U.S. </F>
Trade Representative Barshevsky by correspondent Shigeru Komago; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] 1. Without agreeing on the fundamental understanding 
needed to realize the agreement made last July, Tsutomu Hata, 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister, and U.S. Trade 
Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor confirmed in Morocco that 
the situation is not ripe to restart the unofficial meetings 
aimed at resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. 
At that time, Foreign Minister Hata indicated the policy that 
he would take USTR Kantor's proposal back to Japan and study it. 
We are waiting for his reply. The stance of the United States 
regarding policies toward Japan will not be changed by a change 
of administrative power in Japan. 
  2. On the bases of the clauses on government procurement and 
other clauses of its comprehensive trade law, the U.S. 
Government, (regardless of whether or not the framework talks 
will be resumed), will pass judgment by the end of April on how 
Japan is abiding by the accord on government procurement of 
electrical communications and medical equipments. 
  3. Japan's macroeconomic policies, designed to significantly 
reduce its current account surplus by stimulating domestic 
demands, and market liberalization in different fields are 
equally important for resumption of the framework talks. 
Regarding macroeconomic policies, we are asking Japan to spell 
out its long-term views on ratio between current account surplus 
and the gross domestic production (GDP). 
  4. It will be difficult for us to resume even unofficial 
meetings unless we have a prospect that a Japanese reply will 
break the deadlock on some points. No decisions have been made 
whether we will hold official meetings at ministerial level or 
the unofficial meetings between vice ministers. The situation 
is unclear as to whether or not we will be able to come to a 
conclusion on the framework talks by the July summit of the 
developed countries (Naples summit).

  [Text] Washington, May 1 KYODO -- The United States has 
postponed until June 30 its decision on whether Japan is 
discriminating against U.S. businesses in government procurement 
of telecommunication and medical equipment, the chief U.S. Trade 
negotiator said Saturday [30 April]. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's office was to 
submit by Saturday to Congress its report that would specify the 
countries it sees as discriminatory against U.S. firms in 
government procurement. 
  The action is based on Title VII of the 1988 Omnibus Trade 
and Competitiveness Act. 
  The countries specified in the report could be subject to 
trade sanctions by the Clinton administration. 
  The Japanese Government of former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa has vowed to put together market-opening measures by 
the end of June. 
  But, Japan may be included in a list of such countries if 
Washington remains unconvinced of the Japanese measures which 
are aimed primarily at rectifying Japan's external trade 
imbalances by boosting domestic demand. 
  The postponement of a decision apparently stems from the 
judgment that it is inadvisable to take a get-tough policy 
toward Tokyo amid the uncertain political outlook in Japan. 
  The new coalition government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
Hosokawa's successor, inaugurated last Thursday, is widely 
viewed as fragile due to the departure of the Social Democratic 
Party [of Japan, SDPJ]. 
  Kantor said, however, that his office will "review the 
situation in 60 days on the basis of Japanese actions in the 
interim." 
  He also noted that "in deciding whether to identify Japan 
under Title VII in 60 days, we will assess the seriousness of 
any official Japanese response to the points that were 
discussed" at his meeting with then Japanese Foreign Minister 
Hata in Marrakech, Morocco, on April 15. 
  Kantor also announced the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative places Japan and five other trading partners on 
the "priority watch list" under the trade act's special 301 
Provision concerning the protection of intellectual property 
rights. 
  The listed countries are subject to a statutory review over 
the next year. 
  Meanwhile, Kantor said his office has put off until June 30 
a 
decision on whether to name China, Argentina and India "priority 
foreign countries" which deny adequate and effective protection 
of intellectual property. 
  If a solution has not been reached by June 30, these 
countries will be named priority foreign countries, and 
investigations of their practices will immediately be initiated 
under Section 301 of the trade act. 
  U.S. concerns over protection of intellectual property 
rights 
in China have been prompted by massive pirating of compact discs 
in that country. 
  Kantor indicated in a teleconference with U.S. journalists 
that the U.S. Administration does not want bilateral trade 
problems with China to become confused with the question of 
whether to extend China's most favored nation (MFN) trade status. 
  President Bill Clinton must decide whether to renew the 
status by June 3.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- The Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI) on Monday blasted the latest U.S. 
report on Japanese trade barriers as hampering global free trade 
activity. The 1994 National Trade Estimate on Foreign Trade 
Barriers announced by the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) at the end of March found Japan guilty of 
unfair trade practices in many industrial sectors. 
  The latest USTR report on foreign trade barriers is 
"significantly different" from those prepared in past years in 
that it is aimed to pave the way for invocation of a retaliatory 
trade provision known as Super 301, MITI said. Unilateral trade 
measures like Super 301 constitute violations of the recently 
signed global trade accords under the Uruguay Round sponsored by 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), MITI said. 
  "Such steps are global targets of criticism as they erode 
free trading systems," MITI said in a statement. 
  The statement dismissed U.S. claims that Japan's markets are 
closed while its trade surplus, traced to the closed nature of 
the markets, helped deprive Japan's trade partners of 
opportunities for employment and production. 
  Japan's global trade surplus has been derived not from its 
market conditions as if it were closed but from macroeconomic 
structural problems, the statement explained. 
  MITI also argued there is no ground to support the claim 
that 
Japanese markets are more closed than other countries. An 
average tariff on industrial and mining products is only 2.2 
percent in Japan against 5.4 percent in the United States and 
5.7 percent in the European Union (EU), MITI explained. 
  Under the recently reinstated Super 301, Washington will 
seek 
to identify foreign trade barriers using the USTR findings. The 
U.S. would then have until Sept. 30 to pinpoint priority 
countries that are engaged in unfair trading.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 1 KYODO -- South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam told Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata in a telephone 
conversation Sunday [1 May] that Seoul will closely cooperate 
with Japan and the United States in dealing with North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons program. 
  Kim made the remarks when he telephoned Hata to convey his 
congratulations on his assuming the premiership and forming the 
cabinet Thursday, Japanese officials said. 
  "Through those close relationships (among the three 
nations), 
we can prevent North Korea from developing nuclear (weapons)," 
Kim was quoted by Japanese officials as telling Hata. 
  Hata replied, "Japan will not change its policy of opening a 
window for dialogue with North Korea while showing the 
international society's steadfast stance toward it," the 
officials said. 
  "As the (nuclear issue) has been approaching a serious 
phase, 
(Japan) will continue keeping close relations with South Korea 
and the U.S.," Hata said. 
  North Korea has refused to accept full inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), increasing suspicions 
that it is trying to develop nuclear bombs. 
  Kim also said, as in the case with the cabinet headed by 
former Premier Morihiro Hosokawa, that South Korea will proceed 
with its efforts to establish future-oriented relations with 
Japan. 
  Hata replied that the new government will succeed Hosokawa's 
foreign policy which "aims at establishing future-oriented 
Japan- Korea relations by facing up past history."

  [Text] Implementing the Lao Government's humanitarian 
policy toward the families of American personnel missing in 
action during the war, and based on the 1994 cooperation plan 
approved by both sides, the Lao-American Joint Technical Team 
will carry out a joint operation in the two northern provinces 
of Houa Phan and Xieng Khouang from 4 May to 1 June. This will 
be the fifth joint operation carried out under the 1993-94 plan. 
During this fifth joint operation, technicians from both sides 
will investigate plane crash cases and look into information 
about American nationals the U.S. side believes are still alive. 
They will also conduct surveys and excavations at a total of 
nine sites in the two provinces. This is the largest number of 
sites surveyed and excavated since the first instance of 
cooperation. During the planned joint operation, technicians 
from both sides will be divided into three groups -- two 
excavation groups and one investigation group. The joint 
operation team is expected to complete its work in these two 
provinces before moving on to work in other provinces. 
  The Lao side has done its best thus far to uphold its 
obligations in accordance with the plan agreed to by the two 
sides.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 28 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
has once again voiced its concern over the increasing tendency 
on the part of certain influential members of the United Nations 
Security Council to be selective in [word indistinct] questions 
of international peace and security. Malaysia's permanent 
representative to the UN, Razali Ismail, said this was clearly 
demonstrated by the council's reluctance to enforce its own 
resolutions to the situation in Bosnia. Razali said: The 
procrastination and half-hearted approach to end Serbia's 
blatant aggression and practice of ethnic-cleansing in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a clear example of the council's 
selectivity and double standards. 
  In fact, the council appeared to be locked in a political 
paralysis with some influential members weighing the political, 
financial and manpower costs to get involved in the crisis, he 
said when addressing the opening of the [word indistinct] 
working group on the question of equitable representation on and 
increase in the membership of the security council in New York, 
Wednesday. 
  The text of his speech was faxed to BERNAMA on [word 
indistinct] Thursday. 
  Razali said: Worse still, the council continues to deny the 
inherent right of the victims of aggression and the government 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina for collective or individual 
self-defence under Article 51 of the charter. 
  Razali said the council must use the special power given it 
to display impartiality and drop its double standards and not be 
dictated by its domestic constituents alone. 
  A close and careful examination of the security council's 
record clearly revealed that its achievements remain far from 
satisfactory. There are too many crisis and trouble spots in the 
world that demand the council's attention, he said.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 KYODO -- A North Korean diplomat 
said Friday [29 April] the replacement of spent fuel rods at a 
nuclear power plant cannot be postponed and replacement of the 
rods will go ahead with or without the oversight of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  "If the production of electricity is to continue, then it is 
necessary to change the fuel rods... The matter of changing the 
fuel rods is in no way related to the agency (IAEA)," said Tae 
Chong-chae, a minister at the North Korean embassy in Beijing. 
  Last week North Korea invited IAEA inspectors to view the 
removal of the rods at an experimental nuclear reactor at 
Yongbyon, a key nuclear facility suspected by the west of 
producing weapons grade plutonium. 
  The IAEA has yet to respond to the invitation and is 
awaiting 
Pyongyang's response to IAEA demands concerning the history of 
the plant. 
  A team of IAEA inspectors sent to North Korea in March 
returned to their home base in Vienna claiming that North Korean 
officials had interfered with their two-week inspection, leading 
to a further deterioration in the yearlong standoff over 
Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons program.

  [Text] US Ambassador David Lambertson told Thai Commerce 
Minister Uthai Phimchaichon yesterday that Washington fears 
proposed amendments to the Alien Business Law will harm 
operations of US businessmen already in Thailand. The 1966 
Treaty of Amity between the US and Thailand allows Americans the 
same rights as Thais to engage in many occupations normally 
prohibited to foreigners. 
  The law is being amended because the new General Agreement 
on 
Trade in Services, due to come into force next year, will 
prohibit signatories from discriminating among foreigners of 
different nationalities in professional and other services. 
  The European Community, Japan, Australia and a number of 
other developed countries have repeatedly complained that their 
nationals are deprived of the rights granted in Thailand to 
Americans. 
  The United States is worried that by rewriting the law and 
ending discrimination, Thailand will withdraw rights now held by 
Americans rather than extending them to other nationals. 
  Mr Uthai said Mr Lambertson feared the amendments would 
retard investment by Americans in Thailand. 
  "I informed to him that the law just approved the 
recommendations of the committee set up to amend the law, but it 
still needs future review and submission to the Cabinet again 
before being read in the Parliament," Mr Uthai said. "So it is 
still not certain that the amended law will be passed as 
proposed." 
  A source said the proposed amendments did not specify that 
business operations that have already been established or may be 
established in the future under the Treaty of Amity would be 
exempted. The old Alien Business Law made this distinction. 
  Mr Uthai said Mr Lambertson also insisted that Universal 
Insurance Co, a Thai firm 99.84 percent owned by American 
shareholders, should receive the same right as Thai firms in 
setting up its 11 branches under the Treaty of Amity. 
  But he told the US envoy that the ministry is seeking a 
legal 
interpretation from the Juridical Committee on whether Universal 
Insurance will be treated as a Thai or an American firm. The 
Cabinet will have the final say in the matter, Mr Uthai said. 
  Mr Lambertson characterized his one-hour talk with Mr Uthai 
as a good discussion and expressed hope that a satisfactory 
solution could be reached in the Universal case. 
  Mr Uthai also said that Mr Lambertson confirmed that 
Thailand 
would remain on Washington's so-called Priority Watch List, 
under which the US will monitor the protection of the 
intellectual property rights. At the same time, Washington 
recognized the progress Thailand was making in enforcing patents 
and copyrights, he said.

  [Excerpts] Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, chairman of the 
Foreign Affairs Policy Committee [FAPC] and secretary-1 of the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], met with 
officers and staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs reception hall at 0745 this morning 
and delivered an address concerning departmental affairs. 
  The ceremony was attended by FAPC members Home Affairs 
Minister Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn, National Planning and Economic 
Development Minister Brigadier General Abel, Foreign Affairs 
Minister U Ohn Gyaw, Attorney General U Tha Tun, SLORC Office 
Director General Lieutenant Colonel Pe Nyein, and Myanmar 
[Burmese] ambassadors, directors general, officers, and staff of 
the Foreign Ministry. 
  Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that personnel from the 
Foreign 
Ministry know very well that the SLORC has given special 
consideration to international relations and has accordingly 
worked for Myanmar [Burma] to have a good image in the 
international community. The SLORC, which took on the 
responsibilities of the state on 18 September 1988, in its 
Announcement No. 3/88 of that day stated that the Union of 
Myanmar will continue to pursue an independent and active 
foreign policy. Everybody knows, he noted, that the SLORC has 
implemented its foreign policy with straightforwardness and 
dignity in the area of international relations since then. He 
also noted, that it [the SLORC] has faced and steadfastly 
overcome -- and is still steadfastly overcoming -- threats, 
impasses, allegations, pressures, and tensions so as not to 
deviate from its independent and active foreign policy. [passage 
omitted on diplomatic principles and rejoining Nonaligned 
Movement] 
  He remarked that Myanmar has constantly opposed allegations 
based on the original fixed standard of human rights, which is 
without any regard to a country's significant historical, 
cultural, religious, and traditional backgrounds. Khin Nyunt 
explained that Myanmar has already accepted human rights 
standards in accordance with its own cultural and traditional 
background and these standards are the main consideration for 
the Myanmar people. He noted that, although the contribution of 
labor is a noble deed in Myanmar tradition, western tradition 
eyes it as forced labor and a violation of human rights. Next, 
he observed that Myanmar is working together with United Nations 
human rights organizations to show Myanmar's sincere desire to 
cooperate with international organizations concerning human 
rights. [passage omitted on cooperation with UNHCR, neighboring 
countries, and international organizations] 
  Continuing, Lt. Gen Khin Nyunt explained that the SLORC, in 
order to effectively and extensively implement matters relating 
to foreign affairs, has formed the FAPC with responsible 
personnel from the government. He explained that the FAPC has 
been responsible for important policy matters concerning 
international relations. Next, he noted that the SLORC has 
reorganized the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control and has 
stepped up its efforts with increased momentum on drug 
eradication. [passage omitted on formation of border development 
committee, drug eradication efforts, and formation of 
environmental protection committee] He remarked that the damage 
to Myanmar's image caused by allegations based on human rights, 
drug eradication, and environmental protection matters can be 
repaired if the current achievements are made known to the 
international community. He noted that the main duty of the 
Foreign Ministry service personnel is to inform the 
international circle about the accomplishments, the government's 
stance, and its goodwill. [passage omitted on activities of 
information committee] He stated, only when one knows the true 
facts about one's country can one be able to explain it to 
others. Khin Nyunt urged the foreign service personnel to study 
more about the country's true facts and to explain those genuine 
conditions when opportunity arises for the benefit of the 
country. [passage omitted on national convention, economic 
reforms, economic plans, personal affairs of foreign service 
personnel, national objectives, national reconciliation, and 
border development] 
  He explained that he was saddened to hear that some armed 
organizations have not only neglected the country's goodwill 
gesture for national reconciliation but have been planning to 
create obstacles for the country. He noted that these 
organizations have accepted assistance from countries and 
organizations which are trying to influence Myanmar, and are 
drawing up plans and trying to humiliate and tarnish Myanmar's 
image on the international stage. He remarked that they have 
approached foreign governments, nongovernmental organizations, 
and international organizations and have given them fabricated 
news concerning Myanmar; they have drawn up and engaged in plans 
to create difficulties, to exert pressure, to impose political 
and economic sanctions, and finally to isolate Myanmar from the 
international community. He said that they are using all kinds 
of ways to influence various international organizations. In 
implementing their plans, they have arranged talks and seminars 
at foreign universities and among intellectuals, and have 
approached organizations that present awards. Khin Nyunt 
explained that it can be clearly seen that they have now even 
reached the international organization level by using human 
rights as a leading tool. He noted that since these 
organizations are using diplomatic and other means to implement 
their plans, the state [Myanmar] will also have to use the right 
diplomatic approach to let the world know of the state's 
constructive views. He stated that last year a special 
delegation was sent to several countries to explain Myanmar's 
stance, objective, and achievements. [passage omitted on 
diplomatic code of conduct, and cooperation among departments] 
  Finally, Khin Nyunt urged foreign service personnel to abide 
by the diplomatic code of conduct in performing their duties and 
responsibilities, to let the world know about the state's 
objectives and accomplishments, to uphold the dignity of a 
diplomat and abstain from activities that would tarnish the 
country's status, to safeguard Myanmar culture and traditions 
and to be patriotic, to be loyal to the country and the people, 
to adhere to the public services code of conduct and to fulfill 
the national duties of a citizen, and to work for the betterment 
of the country and the people with a spirit of unity. The 
ceremony concluded at 0900.

  [Text] North Korea rejected the International Atomic 
Energy Agency's [IAEA] new proposal that the IAEA conduct gamma 
mapping and analysis on used nuclear fuel later. Accordingly, 
the IAEA has canceled the plan to send five inspectors to North 
Korea. 
  IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said: North Korea sent a reply to 
the IAEA's new proposal on 29 April, and an analysis of the 
reply message by IAEA high-level policy makers has come to the 
conclusion that it is unsatisfactory [manjoksuropchi motan 
kosuro kyollonul naeryoddago]. 
  He stressed: The IAEA has canceled the planned visit to 
North Korea by the five inspectors, who were supposed to leave 
for the country today [30 April], since North Korea notified 
that it cannot meet the IAEA's demand that North Korea allow the 
inspection team to conduct necessary inspection activities when 
fuel rods are changed. 
  Hans Meyer also said that the IAEA plans to discuss the 
change of fuel rods with North Korea again early next week.

<F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] Although North Korea has rejected essential 
inspection activities during its replacement of nuclear fuel 
rods, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has assumed 
a position of immediately dispatching an inspection team to 
North Korea and not discarding dialogue with the DPRK in 
expectation of a change in the North's basic position through 
contact with the United States. 
  The IAEA is hoping that North Korea, in the face of the 
report to be presented by IAEA Director-General Hans Blix at the 
UN Security Council in mid-May, will show a positive response 
through contact with the United States and that dialogue with 
North Korea will be maintained. The IAEA is also keeping the 
five-member inspection team, who have already obtained entry 
visas to North Korea, on standby. 
  It is a basic position of the IAEA that it determines if 
North Korea converted used nuclear material through inspection 
activities during North Korea's replacement of nuclear fuel 
rods, and to provide a perfect surveillance system to prevent 
North Korea from converting used nuclear material in the future. 
  North Korea rejected IAEA's essential inspection activities 
through which IAEA can verify if used nuclear material was 
converted and revealed its intention to use this issue as a 
negotiating card during contact with the United States to gain 
support for its light- water reactor. 
  Apart from such moves by North Korea, North Korea linked the 
nuclear issue with the third round of U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks during the recent working-level contact with 
the United States. Thus, it is likely that in the event the 
North Korean demand is accepted during the upcoming U.S.-North 
Korean contact in New York, North Korea will accept the IAEA 
demand for substantive inspection activities.

  [Text] It has become known what economic topics will be 
discussed at the summit talks of the industrialized nations 
(Naples summit) scheduled for July. Attaching importance to the 
issue of intensifying unemployment and focusing on the central 
theme of "growth and employment," the participants will discuss 
measures to stimulate the macroeconomy in such nations as Japan 
and Germany, as well as labor issues, including unemployment 
insurance and immigration connected with various nations. Other 
issues to be discussed include "trade and labor," which concerns 
problems connected with the export of products through cheap 
labor. With regard to aid for nations shifting to the market 
economy, participants will focus on aid for Russia and Ukraine 
as well. Suffering from serious economic stagnation, Ukraine has 
requested financial aid amounting to $20 billion. It seems most 
likely that the United States and European nations will strongly 
request Japan to expand its domestic demand, and the minority 
administration under Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will be forced 
to overcome difficulties in coordination to work out concrete 
measures such as tax cuts beginning in fiscal 1995. 
  Various nations have come to share the common understanding 
that the top priority task lies in overcoming unemployment which 
may lead to social unrest. Discussions will be held on the 
strategy of creating jobs to promote global economic growth. 
And as part of this strategy, consultations will be held on 
requesting those nations that are rather slow in business 
recovery -- Japan and Germany, for instance -- to take 
additional financial measures such as tax cuts as well as 
economic stimulus measures such as monetary relaxation. To 
control increases in long-term interest rate which are 
detrimental to economic growth, the participating nations intend 
to request such nations as the United States to take measures to 
steadily reduce their financial deficits. 
  For the purpose of creating new jobs, discussions will be 
held on technological cooperation among various nations in the 
fields of information and communications, including development 
of multimedia. Among other topics for discussion is how to 
overcome structural problems connected with immigrants and the 
system of excessive insurance for unemployment. All these 
problems are detrimental to the creation of new jobs. 
  Now that GATT will become the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
in 1995, the participating nations will discuss the issue of 
"establishing a new world trade system." Since no decision has 
been made as to what issues connected with WTO will be 
discussed, the theme for coordination at the summit remains 
fluid. However, topics for discussions are likely to include 
policies for competition, environmental protection, development, 
and investment. 
  With regard to aid for nations shifting to market economies, 
the first priority will still be given to Russia as decided at 
the Tokyo summit last year. However, the issue of providing aid 
amounting to $20 billion to Ukraine will be brought up at the 
upcoming summit. Due to the fact that economic stagnation has 
become more serious in Ukraine, it has become an issue of common 
interest to all industrialized nations to prevent an outflow of 
refugees from Ukraine and the repetition of nuclear power 
station accidents.

<F P=106> [By Yuki Nagamochi] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr -- "An agreement on cooperation in 
ensuring the safety of nuclear power generation" will be 
concluded between the Japanese and Chinese governments. It is 
expected that in China, where the demand for energy supply is 
increasing, atomic power plants will increasingly be built in 
coastal areas. But there is concern about the possibility that 
if accidents occur there, neighboring nations including Japan, 
will be affected. To prevent such a possibility, a clause on 
the promotion of government-level exchanges on safety 
regulations and of information in emergency cases will be 
included in the agreement. 
  The agreement will be concluded on 3 May between the Agency 
of Natural Resources and Energy placed under Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, and China's Nuclear Safety 
Administration [NSA], which manages licensing systems for 
building atomic power plants and safety regulations for power 
plant operation. 
  The two governments are expected to launch periodical 
exchanges in accordance with the agreement. During the 
exchanges, the Japanese government plans to present concrete 
safety measures designed to prevent nuclear accidents in 
addition to a report analyzing causes of past nuclear accidents 
in Japan, with recommended after-accident action. Thanks to the 
agreement, information on the details of nuclear accidents -- 
which is usually closed to the public because of "state secrets" 
-- is expected to be open to the public. 
  Changing its energy supply policies last year, China decided 
to promote the construction of nuclear power stations -- which 
were placed in secondary importance compared to thermal-power 
and water-power generation -- in locations centered around 
coastal areas where the economy is developing remarkably. This 
is because China urgently requires replenishment of a shortage 
of electric power which is said to be 20-30 percent below total 
needs. New power plants are scheduled to be built on the 
premises of the Qinshan nuclear power plant (in Zhejiang 
Province) and the Dayawan nuclear power plant (in Guangdong 
Province).

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Hata's Minority Government Faces Rough </F>
Sailing"] 
  [Text] The Hata government has been inaugurated at long 
last. The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is not 
participating in the new government, and therefore it is a 
minority government. We cannot help but say that the road ahead 
of the Hata government is rough. 
  Immediately following his talks with SDPJ Chairman Murayama, 
which ended in failure, Prime Minister Hata formed his cabinet 
without the SDPJ's participation. He must have thought that it 
was essential to form the cabinet quickly, to avoid prolonging 
the interregnum. We think it was inevitable that he would form 
the cabinet in that way. 
  There are a number of immediate, difficult problems 
confronting the Hata government, which already faces 
difficulties in managing the political situation. We urge not 
only Prime Minister Hata but also the new cabinet ministers to 
come to grips with those problems, keeping in mind the situation 
affecting Japan. 
  "Because the new government has to tackle important tasks 
right away, I have given these people, including those of the 
younger generation, cabinet portfolios because they are 
competent in the affairs of the secretariats they will head," 
Hata said after naming his cabinet. The prime minister's 
comment reflects his determination to navigate the violent seas 
ahead with a cabinet that will take a practical approach in 
settling the critical problems facing the nation. 
  The new cabinet clearly shows that Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], the core member of the coalition, will have a bigger say 
in running the government. Although many analysts say that 
Hata's minority government will likely be short-lived, Shinseito 
members in the cabinet seem determined to serve Hata well in 
running the government by drawing on their experience as former 
members of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. 
  The post of chief cabinet secretary has been given to 
Shinseito member Hiroshi Kumagai, who served as minister of 
international trade and industry in the Hosokawa cabinet. Thus, 
Shinseito members are in the pivotal posts of prime minister and 
chief government spokesman. Unlike the Hosokawa cabinet's 
combination of a prime minister from the Japan New Party and 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura from Sakigake [Harbinger], Hata 
and Kumagai will be able to function more flexibly and swiftly 
in making decisions when different viewpoints must be ironed 
out. The Hata-Kumagai team should also be able to function well 
in times of crisis management. 
<H5>  Settle Urgent Issues Quickly </H5>
  The top priority task given to the new cabinet is to pass 
the 
budget bill for fiscal year 1994. The bill must be adopted as 
soon as possible. 
  Fortunately, the LDP and the SDPJ have made a commitment to 
cooperate in seeking the swift passage of the budget bill. Both 
the ruling and opposition camps should begin budget 
deliberations without delay. The early passage of the bill is 
indispensable to the government's efforts to get the 
economy--which is showing signs of a recovery--back on track. 
  Along with the adoption of the budget bill, the government 
is 
required to urgently carry out a reform of the tax system and to 
break the impasse in Japan's economic relations with the United 
States. 
  The government has to conclude the issue of tax system 
reform 
by the end of June while making efforts to resume the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. To continue tax cuts into next year 
and beyond in order to boost domestic spending and to cope with 
the challenges of an aging society, the Hata cabinet must work 
for indirect tax hikes accompanied by effective administrative 
reform. 
  Promoting deregulation as part of economic reform is also 
important. The appointment of the Hosokawa cabinet's finance 
minister, Hirohisa Fujii, to the same post in the Hata cabinet 
shows that the prime minister takes a serious view of the job of 
revitalizing the economy by such means as expanding domestic 
demand, tax reform, and deregulation. 
  Hata's decision to have Koshiro Ishida retain his post as 
Management and Coordination Agency director general means a turn 
to strong administrative reforms, which are crucial to the 
success of deregulation. We have no objection to the Hata 
cabinet assuming the economic and administrative reform lines 
set by the Hosokawa cabinet. We hope that the new cabinet will 
play a leading role in carrying out those reform while holding 
the bureaucrats' resistance in check. 
  As for crisis management, Japan must keep its attention on 
the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development 
program. How Japan will maintain and strengthen its cooperative 
relations with the United Nations as well as with the United 
States and South Korea is now being tested. 
  Prime Minister Hata -- together with Foreign Minister 
Kakizawa and Defense Agency Director General Kanda, who have 
become cabinet members for the first time -- is required to 
hasten to study possible measures that can deal with any 
emergency situations in the future. 
  It is obvious that the political base of the Hata 
administration is weak. Many in the political world anticipate 
that the cabinet will most likely be forced either to resign en 
masse or dissolve the House of Representatives and call a 
general election shortly after the fiscal 1994 budget is passed, 
thus creating a tense situation within the political arena again. 
<H5>  LDP, SDPJ Must Act Responsibly </H5>
  Meanwhile, the cooperative ties that are apparently being 
forged between the LDP and the SDPJ are irresponsible. The 
tieup is outrageous if it is aimed at toppling the Hata cabinet 
and eventually nullifying the electoral reform plan--the 
introduction of single-seat constituencies combined with 
proportional representation--that was passed in January. 
  If the LDP were in power now, it would have to deal 
responsibly, just as the Hata cabinet does, with such key issues 
as tax reform, trade friction, and the North Korean problem. It 
should be noted that a significantly large number of Liberal 
Democrats are able to concur with the policies advocated by the 
Hata administration on these questions. 
  Nevertheless, it seems that most LDP members, apparently 
either in pursuit of partisan interests or animosity over being 
driven out of power, have taken a futile confrontational 
attitude toward the coalition government. 
  The LDP should rise above partisan politics and join hands 
with the coalition and put the nation's interests first. Now is 
not the time for ruling and opposition camps to be pitted 
against each other over whether the cabinet should resign or 
whether a snap general election should be staged. 
  In the SDPJ camp, there is also a group of legislators in 
favor of the reform policies of the Hata cabinet which is 
willing to find ways to cope realistically with impending issues 
facing the country. Prime Minister Hata, under the 
circumstances, should continue his efforts to muster all 
political forces sharing a common will in order to create a 
stable government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai by </F>
unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN correspondent; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What are the tasks assigned to 
the new government? 
  [Kumagai] We have to pass the budget bill through the lower 
house as soon as possible. Japan and the United States must 
reach an agreement on the economic framework talks before the 
Naples summit in July. It is also hoped that suspicions 
attached to North Korea's development of nuclear weapons will 
eventually be cleared through peaceful negotiations; however, if 
the United Nations decides on imposing sanctions, we will 
cooperate within constitutional limits. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you mean the government's conventional 
view that the Constitution does not recognize the right to 
collective defense remains unchanged? 
  [Kumagai] It is not necessary for the new cabinet to change 
the government's long-held views. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think about criticism of the 
existence of a dual power structure? 
  [Kumagai] It is important for the prime minister to perform 
his duties using good judgment while increasing the openness of 
the decisionmaking process in his administration. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you see any possibility of a 
dissolution of the lower house and a general election under the 
current multiple-seat constituency system? 
  [Kumagai] The Diet adopted a bill on a new electoral system. 
A dissolution of the lower house under the current electoral 
system would reverse the wheels of history. We have to avoid 
that. The next lower house election should be held under the 
newly adopted electoral system. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How will the government promote discussion 
of the tax reform issue? 
  [Kumagai] Discussions of tax reform would serve as an 
important step toward mending tattered relations with the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and bringing the party back 
into the coalition. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What are the prospects for restoring 
coalition ties with the SDPJ? 
  [Kumagai] There are points we have to reflect on, such as 
procedural mistakes. With this in mind, we have to talk 
persistently with the SDPJ to win its understanding. I believe 
the SDPJ will return to the coalition because the SDPJ agreed on 
basic coalition policies after thorough debate. We have to do 
our utmost to have the SDPJ back; otherwise, passage of our 
bills through the Diet will be impossible.

  [Text] Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 
Eijiro Hata [now Minister of International Trade and Industry] 
disclosed in an interview on 25 April that, as a result of 
agreeing to minimum access for rice imports, the ministry will 
accept applications for the registration of trading firms to 
engage in importing rice. However, it is difficult to understand 
the standards for approving the applications, because it is 
stipulated that the approval will be based on "experience and 
credibility" (as stated by a source at the Import Division of 
the ministry's Food Agency). With an increase in the quantity 
of rice imports, there is a great possibility that trade in rice 
will become a big business operation. In this connection, it is 
most likely that stronger requests will be made for revising the 
ambiguous standards for approval. 
  Trading firms engaged in the rice or wheat business, 
importation of which is under the government's control, are 
designated by the Food Agency. At present, there are 20 
registered trading firms engaged in rice trade, with 26 firms in 
wheat trade. Due to the need for emergency imports of a large 
quantity of rice, more than 10 trading firms applied for 
registration in March. However, since all the designated 
trading firms had already started the process of rice 
importation, applications for new registrations have been 
shelved. 
  Among the requirements set by the Food Agency for applying 
for new registration are: the corporation must have capital of 
over 100 million yen [Y] and it must have experience in the rice 
trade in trilateral trade operations. Based on these 
conditions, "the decision on approval for registration has been 
made from the standpoint of experience and credibility" (as 
stated by Import Division Chief Kyuzo Saito). And he added that 
"no firms that have applied this time have met these 
requirements." 
  Nevertheless, there is a strong complaint indicating that 
"it 
remains unclear as to how the examination was conducted and the 
decision was made" (as stated by small and medium-sized trading 
firms). Some of these trading firms did not even know that the 
agency was accepting applications. It is most certain that due 
to continuous imports of rice following the partial opening of 
the rice market, there will be a major change in the rice 
trading system. And to prepare for next year, the Food Agency 
will probably be forced to disclose the requirements for 
registration and also the process for making decisions on the 
approval.

  [Text] On 25 April, the Food Agency announced the result 
of its examiniation of qualifications of trading firms that have 
applied for registration in starting new business operations in 
importing rice and wheat for fiscal 1994, stating that all the 
applications have been rejected. Applications were accepted 
1-10 March, and over 10 trading firms submitted applications. 
All these trading firms meet the requirements to apply. For 
example, applying trading firms "must be corporations (including 
those set up in Japan but affiliated with foreign companies) 
with capital of over 100 million yen and must have experience 
trading in rice and wheat." 
  However, based on the judgment that, "when viewed from such 
standpoints as credibility and experience in actual trade, these 
firms seem to be unqualified" (as stated by the Import 
Division), the Food Agency has rejected these applications. 
When applications were made, no standards for approval were 
made public. However, all of the trading firms were notified by 
31 March, with each individual firm given reasons for the 
disapproval of the registration. Trading firms have expressed 
dissatisfaction with the decision, saying that "it may somehow 
lead to dango [bid-rigging]."

CSO 

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is considering 
imposing limits on the number of banks which revise their 
articles of incorporation authorizing them to issue preferred 
stock. The reason, according to officials of the Securities 
Bureau, is that "there is the risk that they will have an 
adverse impact on stock prices" if large numbers of banks revise 
their articles of incorporation and if banks which embrace a 
strong sense of following the pack embark on a torrent of 
preferred stock issuances. However, within the ministry, are 
those who recommend prudence in handling the situation, saying, 
"It would be excessive to intervene in matters concerning 
articles of incorporation," and there is the view that it is 
debatable whether the intent of the MOF will assume the form of 
effective "guidance." 
  Preferred stock does not carry voting rights but has 
priority 
over common stock in the payment of dividends. Preferred stock 
often poses a burden in terms of dividends and was rarely issued 
in Japan. However, ever since net worth regulations were imposed 
on banks in 1993, banks faced the urgent need to increase net 
worth and Sakura Bank issued 100 million yen in preferred stock 
in March of this year. 
  Other banks have followed Sakura Bank in considering the 
issuance of preferred stock. Normally, they would prefer issuing 
common stock at market prices to increase net worth, but 
financial institutions are using the majority of their profits 
to write off bad loans. Enhancement of capitalization through 
issuance of common stock is restricted to companies that enjoy 
growing profits and banks are now situated so that they are 
currently unable to issue common stock. Although costs of 
raising capital are somewhat higher with preferred stock, they 
have no choice but to issue such stock. 
  Issuance of preferred stock requires that the articles of 
incorporation be revised at the shareholders' meeting. The 
purpose is to revise the articles of incorporation to specify 
that the board of directors can exercise the authority to issue 
preferred stock. 
  The MOF is attempting to impose a "hold" on the such 
revisions to articles of incorporation. The MOF thinks it can 
forestall a stampede in the issuance of preferred stock if the 
number of banks revising their articles of incorporation can be 
decreased. 
  The Securities Bureau which exercises jurisdiction over the 
stock markets is taking the lead in encouraging a limitation of 
such revisions, but the Banking Bureau, which is directly 
responsible for banks, voices the need for caution in the area 
of "guidance." The reason for such caution is that in terms of 
banking administration, changes to charters of incorporation are 
submitted after the fact and no authority exists for the 
provision of guidance. Further, there was a time when the 
Banking Bureau had encouraged banks to issue preferred stock to 
increase capitalization and "it would be difficult to tell them 
not to revise their articles of incorporation to provide for 
preferred stock at this late stage." 
  Despite such cautionary comments, officials of the 
Securities 
Bureau insist on limiting changes in the articles of 
incorporation and it appears that they have no intention of 
withholding "guidance." Some quarters doubt the efficacy of 
"guidance" that is not backed up by the cooperation of the 
Banking Bureau, but it appears the Securities Bureau is 
considering the imposition of adjustments in issuances through 
"guidance" directed at underwriting securities firms at the 
point of issuance. 
  In the industrial world, there is the view that the issuance 
of large volumes of bank stocks at market prices during the 
bubble economy contributed to the lengthy depression of the 
stock markets. It appears that recent "guidance" has surfaced 
based on comments of that nature. However, a leading life 
insurance company official critically states, in reference to 
attempts to forestall changes to articles of incorporation even 
before issuance of the preferred stock, "Any such attempts 
reminds people of the peculiarities of Japanese markets and 
should have a negative effect on the markets." It is difficult 
to predict the direction to be assumed for the issuance of 
banks' preferred stock amidst a general movement for 
deregulation.

<F P=106> [Article by editorial committee member Atsushi Suemura] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Managing underwriter Nomura 
Securities, commenting on Sakura Bank preferred stock listed on 
the market on 1 April, said, "The theoretical price of preferred 
stock should be close to that of convertible bonds and less 
concern should exist for low pricing to the extent that it 
provides a high return." In the 16 trading days up to 22 April, 
the preferred stock trading volume averaged about 600,000 shares 
per day, which must be considered an improvement over previous 
preferred issues which were said to have faced poor 
marketability. 
  However, one head of a leading securities firm's research 
center states, "Since we have not received any inquiries from 
our trading departments, the truth of the matter is that there 
seems to be little interest in the issue," and some domestic 
institutional investors are "deliberately disregarding the 
issue." The question is, why? 
  If stock prices from the beginning of the year are indexed 
and the price of Sakura Bank's common stock is compared with the 
Nikkei industry sector average for bank stocks, one will note 
the clear-cut lag in Sakura Bank's common stock price. 
  Preferred stock with a total value of 100 million yean was 
issued; specifically, 50 million shares at an issue price of 
2,000 yen with a dividend payable of 45 yen and return of 2.25 
percent, no voting rights, and convertible into common stock 
between 1 July 1994 and 30 September 1997. All Sakura Bank 
preferred stock still outstanding as of 1 October 1997 will be 
converted into common stock. 
  With the exception of individual investors and other 
investors who need to buy Sakura Bank common stock paying an 
annual dividend of 8.5 yen because of special circumstances, 
investors should be attracted to the preferred stock for its 
high dividend and high-return qualities and should think of 
selling their common stock holdings to finance the purchase of 
preferred stock. Assuming that the financial condition of Sakura 
Bank is not noticeably worse than the average institution in the 
banking industry, it is possible that anticipated future supply 
pressures and current selling pressures noted above have 
adversely affected the price of the Sakura common stock. 
  The immediate situation in view of the three-year period 
before the mandatory conversion is another matter, but the 
question arises as to who would want to buy the preferred issue 
in the face of an impending mandatory conversion to common 
stock? Even the concern that "there is no guarantee about how 
long the quality of liquidity can be maintained," cannot be 
considered a criticism made with an ulterior motive. 
  Life insurance companies were critical that preferred stock 
was issued without any action being taken on common stock 
dividends with which they were unhappy. According to a major 
insurance company official, "We hear that underwriting 
securities firms did not offer the preferred stock to existing 
major shareholders, but that was probably the case because they 
did not want to stir up a "hornets nest" of selling in terms of 
common share holdings." 
  Major shareholders, including trust banks, have seen paper 
profits in their common share holdings of Sakura Bank shrink as 
a result of the drop in share prices. From the beginning of the 
year to 22 April, Sakura common stock shrank about 400 million 
yen in value or 8 percent, when compared to banking sector 
average performance for the same period. 
  Even if preferred stock per se is considered an attractive 
product, if the effects of such issuance have resulted in a drop 
in price of the common stock, it must be considered a "villain" 
that violated the interests of existing shareholders. 
  First, the issuance of Sakura Bank preferred stock is a 
"Tier 
I" measure conforming with the narrow definition of net worth to 
conform with the net worth regulations of the Bank for 
International Settlements (BIS), while the issuance of 
subordinate bonds and loans are measures which limit themselves 
to the "Tier II" measure conforming to the broader definition of 
net worth under the same regulations. Thus, under current 
conditions where authorities regulate the means of increasing 
capitalization, they cannot directly market secondary offerings. 
  Issuance of preferred stock which pays a dividend close to 
that of common stock is considered as an increase in 
capitalization, while issuance of bonds with coupons attached 
are not considered as belonging to "Tier I." It appears that 
they settled for a convertible preferred stock as the last 
resort, but it is said that the preferred stock does not carry 
provisions for accumulated dividends for the period of 
convertibility because such assurance of dividends would place 
them in the category of corporate bonds and render them 
unaccountable as "Tier I" instruments. 
  According to one institutional investor, in the sense that 
the Sakura Bank preferred stock was a product giving highest 
priority to facilitating the needs of the issuer by "issuing 
what was actually a secondary offering of common stock disguised 
by a three-year conversion period," they must be labeled as 
stock "with preference for facilitating the needs of the issuer." 
  All Japanese-listed stock are common shares with the 
exception of preferred stock issued as a "last resort." 
Preferred stock whose issuance has been simplified should be 
utilized more often, but no formula exists for assessing the 
value of preferred stock--which has a preference in the payment 
of dividends but no voting rights--or the "value of voting 
rights," and the valuation process becomes even more difficult 
in Japan where the effects of voting rights have been canceled 
out by interlocking stock ownership. 
  Hope seems to have faded that when the commercial law is 
revised, listed subsidiaries such as those of Hitachi will be 
able to issue "bona fide" preferred stock as a means of raising 
capital while the parent company retains majority voting rights. 
The reason is that even now stock of subsidiary firms is, in 
reality, preferred stock without voting rights and if nominal 
preferred stock is issued on top of the existing preferred 
stock, confusion will arise about distinctions between the two. 
  The creation of preferred stock which does not represent a 
measure of the last resort and which is responsive to the needs 
of investors will probably require as a premise the correction 
of the distortions in current common stock markets.

  [Text] The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has embarked on a move to 
increase intervention in terms of selling yen and buying dollars 
on the foreign exchange markets. In recent days, it has not only 
significantly increased the monetary value of its intervention 
activities, but has moved aggressively in arranging consignment 
intervention by overseas central banks. The purpose of the 
increased intervention is to stop the rise in the yen which 
embodies the risk of imposing adverse effects on business 
psychology and to put the economic recovery on track. However, 
in contrast to such goals of the BOJ, the markets still seem to 
anticipate a higher yen. The situation seems to portend a 
continuing struggle between the BOJ and market trends. 
  On 21 April, the International Bureau of the BOJ which is 
responsible for interventions in the foreign exchange markets 
seemed to be enveloped in a tense atmosphere. It engaged in 
intermittent yen-selling and dollar-buying operations, because 
the yen had risen to 102 yen for the first time in nine days. 
The value of dollars used in the intervention operations on that 
day rose to about $1 billion, a substantial rise from the 
average daily value of intervention running at $300-500 million 
through March. 
  Sources at the International Bureau of the BOJ express 
concern in stating, "When the value of the dollar drops to 100 
yen, sales of dollars involving currency-option transactions 
tend to rise and the rise in the yen accelerates." Despite a 
price of $1 to 102-plus yen and a comfortable margin before 
reaching a high of 100.4 yen, the judgment is that aggressive 
intervention must take place. 
  Aside from the quantitative expansion in yen-selling and 
dollar-buying intervention, a qualitative change has taken 
place. According to market sources, the New York Federal Reserve 
Bank placed orders on 20 April to sell yen and buy dollars at 
just above 102 yen to the dollar on consignment from the BOJ. 
  On 14 April, the BOJ engaged in consignment intervention 
through the German Federal Bank to sell yen and buy dollars, 
while concurrently placing rate checks on yen-dollar price 
levels with the Swiss National Bank. Intervention and rate 
checks in Europe were very unusual measures. On that particular 
day, the BOJ showed signs of engaging in consignment 
intervention in the United States as well and the actions were 
interpreted by the markets as a "demonstration by the BOJ of a 
stance whereby it was marshalling all resources to stop the rise 
in the yen." 
  The increased intervention activity is backed by a strong 
feeling of a higher future yen. On the 18th, the Federal Reserve 
Board (FRB) raised the federal funds (FF) rate which corresponds 
to the the Japanese call rate by 0.25 percent. That move led to 
a concern for the triple chain-reaction drop in bonds, stocks, 
and the dollar. Under such circumstances, there is the potential 
that money leaving the dollar and moving into the yen will cause 
a further rise in the yen's market value. 
  Japanese surpluses are still running at high levels, 
including the highest historical record surplus of $121.9 
billion in the fiscal year 1993 trade surplus which reflected a 
10-percent rise over the prior year. On the other hand, 
according to Yoshihiko Koito, managing director of Sumitomo 
Bank, "Institutional investors such as life insurance companies 
are cautious about investing in dollar-denominated bonds and 
there is a continuation in the structure whereby funds once 
converted to yen because of trade surpluses no longer flow into 
other foreign currencies." Chase Manhatten Bank's European 
economist Robin Marshall speaks of the lingering prospect that 
"the United States will exercise pressure to raise the value of 
the yen to reduce the Japanese trade surpluses." 
  However, more than a few question the effect of 
intervention. 
The reason is that at one time BOJ intervention represented a 
sizable proportion of overall market transactions, but now that 
the size of market transactions has expanded, the direct effect 
of intervention has diminished. In reality, there is a strong 
underlying demand among export firms to sell dollar futures and 
buy yen and the Industrial Bank of Japan observes that "there is 
the prospect that the yen will break through its previous record 
highs." 
  The BOJ is poised to intervene in the markets at a daily 
rate 
of $3 billion in the event the dollar falls below 100 yen, but 
that does not mean that the BOJ will be able to cope with the 
yen-buying trend in the markets. Thus, there are sources that 
say, "Unless the New York Federal Reserve Bank engages in 
collaborative intervention with the BOJ, there will be no way 
that the rise in the yen can be stopped." 
  The Economic Planning Agency, in its "Questionnaire Survey 
Concerning Corporate Actions," stated that the exchange rate at 
which export firms can operate profitably is 117 yen to the 
dollar. It is said that, at the current rate of just over 100 
yen to the dollar, the majority of export firms must resign 
themselves to a drop in profits. A high yen runs the risk of 
adversely affecting an incipient recovery in the economy as a 
result of a deterioration in business psychology. 
  Although the government and the BOJ state that "situations 
must be handled in an appropriate manner," the markets are 
becoming inured to intervention. The day when the dollar falls 
below 100 yen, which will pose many difficulties for the 
Japanese economy, is gradually nearing and the situation 
portends an agonizing battle for the BOJ.

  [Text] The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has begun trading 
on the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange (TIFFE). 
The objective of the bank is to avoid the risk of losses 
associated with changes in interest rates by utilizing futures 
to better manage an increase in yen-denominated assets held. The 
move represents recognition of yen interest futures by an 
international agency and may support an expansion in the 
utilization of the yen in international markets. Other 
international agencies are also in the process of studying entry 
into the TIFFE. 
  Total investments of the ADB as of the end of fiscal year 
1993 were roughly $6.7 billion, $1.4 billion of which were 
yen-denominated. Those investments include not only short-term 
yen assets, but involve redemption of long-term yen bonds which 
expose the bank to risks associated with fluctuations in 
short-term interest rates of the yen. The portion of 
yen-denominated investments has continued to increase from the 
latter half of the 1980s and the need had risen to take risk 
avoidance measures. 
  Accordingly, the ADB signed a contract with the Bank of 
Tokyo 
to engage in Euroyen interest futures transactions and has begun 
trading in futures via the Bank of Tokyo. During the past 
several days, transactions have been limited to less than 100 
transactions, with one contract covering 100 million yen, but 
ADB plans to increase its transactions on a phased basis while 
keeping an eye on the markets. Since it foresees a future rise 
in short-term yen interest rates, it will sell interest futures 
for the time being. Since profits will be realized on the 
futures when the interest rates actually rise, such profits will 
be used to cover losses in the value of assets held. 
  Yen interest futures began trading on the TIFFE in 1989. 
Volume of Euroyen interest futures which is a principal product 
traded on the exchange reached 23.38 million contracts in 1993, 
ranking fourth on a worldwide basis for a single product behind 
that for U.S. Treasury bond futures. ADB decided on full-scale 
participation in the markets, assuming that it can engage in 
stable transactions relative to yen interest futures on the 
TIFFE. 
  Emphasis is placed on worldwide avoidance of risks in price 
fluctuations, but it has been pointed out that international 
transactions have not increased because inadequate avoidance 
measures existed for the yen. The commencement of trading in yen 
interest futures by an international agency of high credibility 
is substantiation that the Tokyo markets have acquired avoidance 
means to minimize risks associated with market fluctuations. As 
a result, there is the possibility of increased use of the yen 
by international financial agencies and businesses as well as 
increased internationalization of the yen.

<F P=106> [Article by Washington correspondent Shoji Shinohara] </F>
  [Text] The meeting of finance ministers and central bank 
presidents of the seven major nations (G-7) closed with a 
chairman's declaration of cooperation on macroeconomic policies 
such as reaffirmation of cooperation concerning the 
stabilization of foreign currency exchange rates. In actuality, 
it appears to have become a unification of purpose to suppress 
discontent by various nations against other nations and to 
temporarily calm unstable movements in the markets which were a 
threat to the recovery of the world economy. As a result, an 
ironic outcome has been the postponement of action on almost all 
of the difficult issues such as unemployment and economic 
problems confronting Japan and the United States which are the 
major destabilizing factors of markets, making the real effects 
of the agreement an unknown quality. 
  Before the opening of the G-7 meetings, a high-ranking 
Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said, "The principal role 
player in the upcoming G-7 is neither Japan nor the United 
States, but the market itself." 
  The recent G-7 meetings were held just as the economies of 
the advanced nations were being violently shaken by fluctuations 
in the foreign exchange and debenture markets. The chairman's 
declaration read by U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen warned 
against excessive reactions of foreign exchange and debenture 
markets and had the strong effect of serving as a message to 
market sources. 
  G-7 meetings in the past debated individual issues such as 
Japan's trade surpluses and the U.S. fiscal deficits and had the 
strong purpose of questioning the macroeconomic policies of the 
respective nations. However, insofar as the recent chairman's 
declaration is concerned, it stated, "The slow growth in certain 
nations has delayed the correction of international payments 
imbalances," thus suggesting domestic expansion of economic 
activity in Japan, but no signs of centering criticism on 
individual nations relative to separate issues. 
  Foreign exchange rates which are leaning towards a high yen 
and low dollar have had an adverse effect on Japanese export 
firms and run the risk of delaying Japan's economic recovery. 
Even for the United States, a cheap dollar will cause a rise in 
long-term interest rates and will expose the economy to an 
unfavorable trend. 
  A rise in long-term U.S. interest rates will not only 
frustrate an economic recovery, but will have an adverse effect 
on efforts to cut the fiscal deficit. And the impact will not be 
limited to those two phenomena. Sources at the International 
Financial Survey Department of the Industrial Bank of Japan 
state, "As concerns financial markets, especially relative to 
long-term interest rates, international linkage has been 
reinforced rather than providing for decoupling (separation of 
markets)." There's also the risk that higher interest rates in 
the United States will destroy the effects of financial easing 
measures in Germany. 
  It was once considered a priority issue for the G-7 to take 
some kind of action against financial market turbulence of this 
nature. As an example, if friction between Japan and the United 
States on trade issues were to once again surface at the G-7 
meetings, there is the possibility that the yen would climb even 
further. In the recent G-7 meetings, it appears it was a common 
perception among the G-7 nations that they wished to avoid to 
the degree possible any situation which could result in the 
exchange of criticism on individual issues. 
  Needless to say, even though an agreement had been reached 
on 
stablizing foreign exchange and debenture markets, there is no 
guarantee that financial markets would react as anticipated by 
the governments of the respective nations. 
  In fact, the Tokyo foreign exchange markets on the 25th had 
already taken into account the G-7 agreement on stabilizing 
foreign exchange markets and assumed no agreement had been 
reached on policies for renewed cooperative intervention and 
shifted to a higher yen and cheaper dollar. MOF sources in Japan 
which had found some solace in the inclusion of foreign exchange 
stabilization provisions in the chairman's declaration found 
their hopes for stability crushed at an early stage. 
  We cannot say that there are no concrete effects because it 
was an agreement of a superficial nature. If the dollar falls to 
100 yen in foreign currency markets, there is the possibility of 
intervention not only by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) but by European 
and U.S. authorities as well. Even BOJ officials insist that "we 
should take an objective stand relative to the chairman's 
declaration on foreign exchange markets," and suggest that the 
respective nations will react to any sharp rise in the yen. 
  Any effort to put the advanced nations' economies back on 
the 
track of stable growth will require that importance be placed on 
the early execution of the the G-7 "growth strategy" calling for 
the United States to reduce its fiscal deficit, for European 
nations to continue their policy of monetary easing and for 
Japan to expand domestic demand and reduce its trade surplus. 
  However, there are many pending issues, such as medical 
insurance reform in the United States as it affects U.S. fiscal 
policy and an expansion in the money supply in the area of 
German financial policy. 
  In Japan, political turmoil has had an effect in delaying 
the 
implementation of economic measures and the tax reduction 
extension past the next fiscal year as revealed to the United 
States by Minister of Finance Fujii awaits coordination within 
the coalition government relative to how long it will remain in 
force before implmentation of provisions for offsetting tax 
increases as well as the scope of the tax reductions. 
  Among G-7 nations, there lay a pile of issues, such as 
between Japan and the United States as to when talks will be 
resumed on the comprehensive economic measures. Even in 
connection with the issue of unemployment in advanced nations 
which was mentioned at the recent meetings, no concrete 
proposals were discussed and the issue was carried over for 
discussion at the upcoming Naples summit of leaders of advanced 
nations in July. 
  The policy coordination position reflected in the recent G-7 
chairman's declaration represented a unified position hurriedly 
established in the face of financial market threats, and any 
mistake by advanced nations in handling their roles could lead 
to a violent reaction from financial markets.

  [Text] On 18 April, Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) filed for 
approval of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to 
reduce charges for International Marine Satellite (Inmalsat) 
service and expansion of the time zone for discounted calls. The 
reduction in service charges were set at 12 to 18 percent with 
an implementation date of 1 May. They have decided to reduce 
rates based on economies of scale brought on by increased 
traffic and hope to gain further increases in utilization based 
on lower rates. 
  The current price cuts and expansion of discounted time 
zones 
will apply to marine satellite communications services offered 
to the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions via Inmalsat and the KDD 
Yamaguchi satellite station. 
  Price cuts will cover an 18-percent reduction for Inmalsat A 
which consists of analog telephone and facsimile services, 
12-percent reduction for digital Inmalsat B services, and 
13-percent reduction for Inmalsat M services involving 
miniaturized and lightweight marine vessel station facilities. 
As an example, a three-minute call on Inmalsat A services 
covering the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions formerly cost 
2,700 yen but will now cost 2,200 yen. 
  As for discounted time zones, they will be expanded from six 
to 10 hours for Inmalsat A and B services, and expanded an 
additional 10 hours for Inmalsat M services. 
  KDD first offered marine satellite communication services in 
1982 in the form of Inmalsat A services. Its services are now 
utilized by 1,300 Japanese vessels.

  [Text] On 19 April, Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations] (Keidanren) completed recommendations calling for 
a review and maximum deregulation of information communications 
industries regulated by the government in areas such as 
telephone rate decisions and entry into class I electrical 
communication industries. The recommendations state that there 
is no special need to restrict market entry into the class I 
communications industries currently covered by NTT and 
Shindenden "because enormous capital investment requirements 
preclude the easy entry of new participants merely for the 
purpose of acquiring vested rights." Keidanren will work with 
the government to provide for incorporation of its 
recommendations in the government's information-communication 
deregulation plan to be completed by the end of June. 
  Keidanren also compiled an opinion paper concerning the 
construction of optical fiber cable networks in which the 
government is attempting initiatives which calls for 
"construction of optical fiber cable systems by private industry 
as a matter of principle" and for the government to provide 
assistance in the form of loans. 
  It appears that the government's Electrical Communication 
Council will complete a report in June which calls for the 
government to play a central role in the building of an optical 
fiber cable network for use as a new information communication 
network.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Shigenobu Kishimoto, Yokohama National </F>
University] 
  [Text] When exports threaten the very existence of a 
trading partner's industrial sector, they are clearly excessive. 
Excessive exports are the cause of Japan's trade surplus. As 
Professor Kishimoto argues, a nation with a bulging trade 
surplus virtually invites excessive imports, in the end becoming 
completely dependent on imports to maintain its standard of

  I believe that Japan's bloated trade surplus is caused by 
excessive exports, and that any plan to reduce this surplus must 
include export restraints. This assertion applies not only to 
our trade surplus with the United States but with Europe as well. 
  Two objections arise immediately. How exactly are exports 
"excessive"? In comparison to what? And if these "excessive" 
exports were to be curbed, would it not put an end to the 
continuing expansion of world trade? 
  Let me respond. First, the argument that exports are 
"excessive" in comparison to imports assumes that exports should 
be largely counterbalanced by imports. I nstead of addressing 
the relative problem of whether exports are too high or imports 
too low, I believe that we should arrive at a judgment based on 
a more fundamental standard. 
  I propose the following standard: Japanese exports should 
not 
be allowed to threaten the existence of key industries in our 
trading partners. If, for example, the viability of the U.S. 
automotive industry were threatened by exports of Japanese 
automobiles, I would argue that these exports were excessive. 
Here we are not simply talking about a mere loss of market 
share, but a threat to the very existence of an entire industry. 
It is only natural that such exports generate strong opposition 
from threatened industries in our trading partners. 
  Exports soared because Japanese industry long enjoyed 
comparative advantages in terms of quality and price. For this 
reason, I believe that the problem is not a matter of exports 
being too high or too low. Based on my proposed standard, 
however, I would conclude that Japanese exports are indeed 
excessive. I will explain why in a moment. 
  As for the second objection, the argument that world trade 
would constrict if Japan were to curb exports is based on the 
inflated assumption that Japan is somehow the engine of global 
trade expansion. In fact, world trade would probably grow faster 
if Japan were to make way for other nations to expand. 
  My ideas have been described as "autistic." In other words, 
I 
have been accused of adopting an extremely passive attitude, 
bowing sheepishly and waiting for the problem to pass us by. My 
detractors charge that I have failed to address the issue of 
economic development. I believe they are mistaken. 
  It would be great if there were latitude for an expansion in 
world trade. However, there will be no room for growth until 
Japan ends its overbearing presence in the world economy. 
<H5>  Import Expansion Argument Wrong </H5>
  I am opposed to the argument that Japan is importing too 
little, which is another way of saying that if Japan only 
imported more it would reduce its overall trade surplus. 
  Our huge bilateral trade surplus with the United States is 
the result of the fact that exports to the United States far 
exceed imports from the United States. U.S. imports of Japanese 
manufactured goods surpass our imports of U.S. manufactured 
goods by an even greater margin. 
  In per capita terms, however, U.S. imports of Japanese 
products and Japanese imports of U.S. products are roughly even. 
  If one were to insist that bilateral trade between the 
United 
States and Japan be balanced, we would have to consume nearly 
twice as many U.S. imported goods per capita in monetary terms 
than vice versa. That would be virtually impossible to achieve. 
Because the break-even point has been attained on a per capita 
basis, I have a hunch that imports have reached a ceiling. 
  At the conclusion of the most recent round of comprehensive 
trade talks between the United States and Japan, Assistant 
Secretary of Commerce Joan Spero issued a terse statement. She 
said that Japan spent only 3.1 percent of its GNP on imports of 
manufactured goods, less than half the G-7 average of 6.6 
percent (excluding Japan). This level, she insisted, was 
unacceptable to the United States. 
  However, in addition to manufactured goods Japan purchases 
large amounts of agricultural produce from the United States, 
including wheat, soybeans, meat, and citrus fruits. Japan has 
only 30 percent self-sufficiency in these foodstuffs. If Japan 
were to attempt to meet Ms. Spero's demands, it would have to 
purchase more agricultural products in addition to manufactured 
goods. In order to reach bilateral trade parity, Japanese 
purchases of U.S. products would have to increase by more than 
double the current level. 
  Thus, we have the argument that Japan cannot stimulate 
domestic consumption enough to meet American demands. If imports 
were increased to these levels, domestic consumption would fall. 
  If I were to purchase a foreign automobile, a domestic 
automobile would not be sold. Domestic demand would therefore 
decrease. In other words, I believe that we have reached a stage 
at which boosting imports and stimulating domestic demand is a 
zero sum game. 
  Economic theory, moreover, instructs us that increased 
imports do not necessarily lead to decreased surpluses. This 
assertion is validated by empirical laws and historical 
experience. 
  If Japan attempts to expand imports beyond what is currently 
possible, domestic demand for certain products will fall. This 
will force manufacturers to attempt to sell these unsold 
products overseas . Thus, exports will rise. In the end, this 
mechanism may lead to an even larger trade surplus. 
  Because Japan is resource-poor, it has to import raw 
materials and energy. In order to import these essentials, it 
has to earn foreign exchange by exporting. As has often been 
stated in the past, this is no doubt how Japan developed as a 
modern nation. 
  However, Japan currently earns far more foreign exchange 
through exports than it needs. This is what I mean by 
"excessive" exports. As a result of excessive exports, we now 
face the problem of excessive imports. 
  Take, for example, the recent uproar over the rice issue. 
Although Japan is small, the lands from the Kanto plain 
southward are some of the best in the world for paddy-field rice 
cultivation. However, these lands are not being used to grow 
rice. Instead, we have attempted to cultivate rice in the less 
suitable colder regions of Tohoku and Hokkaido where yields are 
lower. Now, we are forced to consider purchasing foreign rice. 
However, to purchase this foreign rice we need to earn foreign 
exchange through exports. 
  If Japan were to become self-sufficient in rice by growing 
more of it in the temperate regions of the country, we would not 
have to earn as much foreign exchange. Thus, we would be able to 
construct a more harmonious global trading order. 
<H5>  Surplus Utility Theory Wrong </H5>
  Last year, the following argument became popular among 
influential economists and bureaucrats: "The Japanese current 
account surplus is caused by the fact that domestic savings far 
exceed investments; thus the idea that the Japanese ma rket is 
closed to outsiders is macroeconomically incorrect." These 
economists and bureaucrats advocate a long-term "surplus utility 
theory." I believe this theory is wrong. 
  The economic behavior of households and companies takes into 
account a variety of factors. When economists base their 
calculations on categories called "savings" and "investments," 
the result is that Japan has an excessive savings rate. The 
implication is that an economic mechanism exists which 
determines that Japan has an excessive savings rate. When 
economists base their calculations on categories called 
"imports" and "exports," the result is that Japan has an 
excessive current account surplus. These results are believed to 
be produced by the same economic mechanism. However, this does 
not mean that it has been theoretically established that the 
so-called excessive savings rate is the cause of the current 
account surplus. 
  Even if a cause-and-effect relationship did exist, couldn't 
we ignore it altogether and just reduce our trade surplus? 
  A trade surplus is not always desirable, even in the case of 
Japan. Currently, Japan is amassing dollars and 
dollar-denominated assets as part of its trade surplus. As the 
yen appreciates on account of this surplus, these accumulated 
dollar-denominated assets gradually lose value. This extremely 
inefficient process feeds on itself. 
  Currently, Japan has a huge trade surplus with the world. 
Practically every nation has a trade deficit with Japan. These 
nations, overburdened by this trade deficit with Japan, are 
drained of foreign exchange. In other words, they are deprived 
of purchasing power. 
  The United States, guarantor of the world's dominant 
currency, issues paper dollars to finance its trade deficit with 
Japan. This action naturally produces global inflation. 
  Japan continues year after year to amass huge trade 
surpluses. This causes severe disruptions of the world economy. 
For the sake of the world economy, this must come to an end. 
  The pros and cons of a trade surplus have been discussed at 
length elsewhere. It has been argued that the trade surplus and 
current account surplus are reinvested in the world economy, 
increasing global financial liquidity. This argument resembles 
the surplus utility theory. Unfortunately, it inverts the cause 
and effect relationship. While a decrease in global financial 
liquidity is certainly undesirable, so is Japanese domination of 
global finances. If Japanese behavior creates a liquidity 
shortage, it is naturally up to Japan to provide financing. 
However, we should not accept the notion that if Japan breaks 
the bones of its trading partners it ought to play a role in 
mending them. 
  What I am saying is different from criticizing the Japanese 
government for encouraging exports to the United States through 
unfair practices such as subsidies and dumping, and for 
restricting imports through tariff and nontariff barriers. The 
United States is to blame for its own trade deficit. Japan 
accounts for only half of the U.S. trade deficit with the world. 
Nevertheless, I believe that we should still consider ways to 
reduce our bilateral trade surplus with the United States for 
our own sake. 
  The huge overall U.S. trade deficit is the result of a 
significant deterioration in its bilateral balance of payments 
with most of its trading partners. It would be a mistake to 
attribute the problem exclusively to Japan. 
<H5>  Curbing Exports </H5>
  In reducing Japan's surplus, it will be necessary to curb 
exports. In order to curb exports, it will be necessary to 
curtail domestic industrial overcapacity. 
  Industrial capacity was increased not to meet domestic 
demand 
but to export to overseas markets. This capacity was expanded to 
the point where it threatened the very existence of entire 
industries in these overseas markets. This overinvestment has 
placed Japan in a serious quandary. 
  Unless they find a way to absorb more foreign manufactured 
goods, Japanese corporations will fail to recover their 
profitability. This is what caused the problem of excessive 
exports. 
  The current industrial overcapacity was caused by the 
behavioral pattern of Japanese corporations which compete 
fiercely against each other for market share. At the root of the 
problem is a simple question: Why were some of these 
corporations still involved in manufacturing ? In the absence of 
a comprehensive corporate strategy, they merely pursued 
increased market share by default. The founders of these 
corporations were by nature goal-oriented. Over time, however, 
these corporations lost sight of practical business goals and 
production targets. They continued to manufacture out of force 
of habit, seeking merely to expand market share. 
  Why then do these corporations continue to manufacture? At 
one time they were locked in a battle for survival, but as 
markets have matured they have settled into trench warfare. They 
take and retake the same stretch of terrain from each other. 
  Even though they suffer from overinvestment in plant and 
equipment, Japanese corporations continue with business as 
usual. They become excited about every new innovative product 
they develop and invest heavily in it. But they have gone to 
extremes. A bit of soul-searching is in order. This kind of 
behavior is all too human. Instead of attempting to fix blame, 
we should be forgiving. 
  My export restriction theory has come under attack with the 
onset of the recession. If the automobile industry were to 
curtail exports in the midst of a domestic slowdown, it is 
argued, automobile production capacity would be needlessly 
squandered. However, I do not believe this would necessarily be 
true. Export restriction, in fact, would be a means to prevent 
further economic deterioration. 
  It can be argued, for example, that U.S. automobile 
manufacturers continue to suffer from the onslaught of Japanese 
automobile exports. In order to curtail automobile exports, the 
Japanese Government could use voluntary export restraints and 
export tariffs. A 100-percent export tariff would raise the 
price of Japanese cars in the United States, thus having the 
effect of curtailing exports. 
  With a 100-percent export tariff, a car which retails for 
1.3 
million yen in Japan would sell for 2.6 million yen in the 
United States. The 1.3 million yen export tariff would be paid 
by American consumers, but would go to the Japanese Government. 
  Let's say that sales of Japanese automobiles in the United 
States fell by 1 million units as a result of the 100-percent 
tariff. The Japanese automobile industry would sustain a big 
hit. However, those 1 million cars would, in effect, be 
purchased by the Japanese Government. In other words, the 
Japanese Government should use the export tariff revenue to 
place orders with Japanese automobile companies. The purchase of 
standard prod uction vehicles is one possibility, but the 
purchase of expensive special vehicles which cost several 
million yen is another. 
  As I have mentioned in earlier proposals, Setagaya ward in 
Tokyo owns only two special vehicles for transporting the infirm 
and elderly. With my proposal we could realize a goal of 100 
special vehicles per every several hundred thousand people. This 
is but one example of how we could convert exports into domestic 
demand. 
  It is possible to convert excessive exports into domestic 
demand. In so doing, we could bring an economy suffering from 
reckless over-investment to a soft landing. 
<H5>  Eve of U.S.-Japan Trade Reversal </H5>
  There is something else we should not forget. We are on the 
verge of a great reversal in U.S.-Japanese trade relations, even 
as our trade surplus with the United States reaches a record 
$150 billion dollars. 
  This may seem paradoxical to many, but I was predicting this 
situation seven or eight years ago. The yen has continued to 
appreciate along with our expanding trade and current account 
surpluses. As a result, cheaper foreign goods are slowly 
changing consumer behavior in Japan. With the exception of some 
regions, imports have grown dramatically. If this pattern 
continues , Japan will soon become a "completely import 
dependent country" (CIDC). 
  If this happens, the yen will begin to depreciate vis-a-vis 
the dollar because Japan will no longer be a net exporter. 
Manufactured goods will be purchased from offshore facilities 
owned by Japanese corporations, and almost all agricultural 
goods will be imported from abroad. 
  When this occurs, currencies depreciate. Since CIDC's are 
profitable to global producers, CIDC currencies become cheaper. 
Thus, the Japanese currency will once again lose value. This is 
my scenario for the U.S.-Japan economic reversal. 
  I have a hunch that we are too optimistic about import 
expansion. For example, many in the financial community believe 
that both our cost of living and standard of living will improve 
without wage increases because of cheap agricultural imports. 
With wage increases in check many expect a revival in Japanese 
competitiveness, but I think it is highly unlikely. 
  It is because we are on the verge of a great reversal that 
the yen is so high. I believe there is a possibility of the 
dollar dropping below the 100-yen level to the 90-yen mark. This 
will intensify the outward migration of Japanese corporations. 
  Until recently, Japan earned most of its foreign exchange 
from four industries: automobiles, consumer electronics, general 
machine tools, and steel. With the exception of a few product 
lines, most of these industries will move production offshore. 
The export industries which generated the huge surpluses will 
disappear from Japan. Dependence on agricultural imports, 
however, will continue. We are setting record trade surpluses 
because we are in the final stage as an exporter. 
  However, the record trade surplus does not mean that Japan 
is 
strong. Japan's clay feet are already crumbling. Japan, however, 
still appears to be a giant because of these clay feet. Thus, 
Japan bashing has ironically become more intense. Japan is 
passing through a very paradoxical phase. 
  In order to avoid this scenario, we must undertake 
"emergency 
evasive maneuvers." 
  For example, consumers should make a clear "declaration of 
intent" to eat only Japanese rice except in times of emergency. 
It would then only be a matter of time before we reached 
self-sufficiency in rice. If the world thinks we are foolish for 
eating expensive Japanese rice instead of cheap American or Thai 
rice, we should remain unfazed. We should not base our 
purchasing decision exclusively on price. 
  Industries continue to move offshore. If this trend 
continues 
unabated, it would be a tragedy. However, it may be too late to 
prevent even key industries from leaving. For this reason, we 
will have to develop new industries.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 28 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDYN ERH" informs that the head of the Central 
Intelligence Board (CIB) of Mongolia has been charged by the 
prosecutor general of Mongolia to strengthen the actions of the 
board for ensuring security. In an official paper addressing 
himself it was said that on the pages of newspapers came to be 
published some copies of the secret documents pertaining to the 
classified or even top secret information. 
  Thus there has been created unfavourable conditions in 
reference to the state security. 
  The document stresses the significance of strengthening the 
efficient arrangement of the work of the CIB for investigating 
such actions bearing a criminal nature as the divulgence of the 
state top secrets through the mass media and the losing of 
secret papers as well.

<F P=106> [Summary of interview with Yi Chong-kok, defector from North </F>
Korea, by SANKEI SHIMBUN correspondent Katsuhiro Kuroda in 
Seoul; date not given] 
  [Text] Seoul, 29 April -- Yi Chong-kok, 25, a defector 
from North Korea, recently granted an interview to SANKEI 
SHIMBUN. Yi used to belong to the Nuclear and Chemical Defense 
Bureau within the Korean People's Armed Forces General Staff 
(defense ministry). Explaining recent military and social 
affairs in North Korea, he said: "Money has begun to rule 
society." Yi is an unmarried "middle-class officer," which is 
equivalent to a noncommissioned officer. While he was posted to 
the "Antinuclear and Antiatom Analysis Institute" [name as 
published] in Pyongyang, he crossed the PRC-North Korean border 
and entered South Korea via the PRC in March this year. The 
following are questions and answers from the interview. 
  [Kuroda] Are there any recent changes in North Korean 
society? 
  [Yi] The people have begun to think money is everything. In 
the past, party members and university graduates were considered 
as ideal partners for marriage. Now people care whether or not 
he has money. If you have money, you can do everything. You 
can get promoted and obtain a job. The people have begun to 
have a keen interest in money. Everybody, including senior 
party and government officials as well as farmers, hopes to 
conduct black-marketeering. Black-marketeering is called "yami" 
in North Korea. It has been rumored that former Prime Minister 
Yon Hyong-muk was dismissed from his post because his wife 
committed irregularities when she exchanged old currencies for 
new. 
  [Kuroda] How is the food and energy situation? 
  [Yi] Rice had been rationed in Pyongyang until 1990. Since 
1991, there has been no rice rationing during the May-June 
off-season. Another event shows the North's poverty. After 
inspecting a front-line unit in October 1992, Vice Premier Kim 
Pok-sin told President Kim Il-song that the guards in the unit 
wore shoes made of tree bark; he appealed to the president with 
tears in his eyes that the unit was in need of food. 
Immediately after this, military shoes and rice were sent to 
the unit. 
  Last July, Pyongyang celebrated the 40th anniversary of the 
Korean war armistice, but without the usual large parade of 
military vehicles such as tanks. This was due to the oil 
shortage. 
  [Kuroda] Do you know anything about the DPRK's nuclear 
development? 
  [Yi] Judging from the atmosphere within the military, I 
firmly believe nuclear weapons have already been developed. 
Encouraged by the fact that Iraq secretly promoted the 
development of nuclear weapons while accepting nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
high-ranking officers in my unit said: "We can also deceive the 
international community." 
  I also heard that, after a U.S. satellite spotted a nuclear 
facility in Yongbyon around the autumn of 1992, the facility was 
covered with trees. 
  [Kuroda] What about the "combat readiness" assumed by North 
Korea after it declared its withdrawal from the nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty last March? 
  [Yi] At that time, the military held a large rally with 
President Kim (supreme commander of the Korean People's Army) 
attending. During the rally they sang "There Will Be No 
Homeland Without You" and "The People Will Continue To Believe 
in General Kim Chong-il Even If the World Changes 100 Times" 
while shedding tears. They said they could believe neither 
Russia nor China. 
  The general opinion is that "waging a war may not be a bad 
idea" to pull the nation out of poverty. But I often heard 
military officers questioning "if we really can win a war." 
Nobody believes the government's propaganda about South Korea, 
which Pyongyang says is prepared to wage an aggressive war 
against the North. 
  [Kuroda] It is said the Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau 
was engaged in research on chemical (poison-gas) weapons. 
  [Yi] The bureau is engaged in research and production of 
almost all kinds of poison gas, including yperite. It can load 
poison gas on shells, bombs, and missiles. 
  [Kuroda] Do you know anything about these missiles? 
  [Yi] We call them "SKUD's (he meant SCUD's)." Those SKUD's 
exported during the Iran-Iraq war caused trouble because of the 
missile's low probability of hitting targets. There are missile 
bases at Hamchun and Hwadae in North Hamgyong Province on the 
east coast, and at Chongchu in North Pyongan Province on the 
west coast. It is said the missiles from these bases can reach 
Okinawa and even Guam. I heard the missiles at a base in 
Chagang Province, which is located along the China-North Korea 
border, are targeted on China. 
  [Kuroda] Is there a possibility the structure of the DPRK 
will change? 
  [Yi] North Koreans know China has become affluent. Thus, 
many have voiced their strong hope that Pyongyang will adopt an 
open-door policy like China. Nevertheless, President Kim and 
his son will not open up the country because they give priority 
to maintaining the current structure. In view of the close and 
constant watch system in the North, I believe the current 
structure will be maintained for at least another three years.

<F P=106> [By Gwen Benjamin] </F>
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 30 KYODO -- First feelers by 
ASEAN to gauge support from potential member countries for its 
proposed East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) has drawn warm 
responses from China and South Korea, but Japan remains 
negative, according to a confidential report. 
  The report by the secretary general of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Ajit Singh, who visited the 
three countries in November, described Beijing's support for 
EAEC as "strong and conditional," with Seoul being "helpful and 
constructive," while Tokyo was "negative." "The Japanese 
reaction was not at all encouraging," the report said, pointing 
out that Tokyo seemed "overly preoccupied" with the reaction of 
the United States, which is excluded from EAEC. A copy of the 
report was obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  Although ASEAN leaders endorsed the Malaysia-proposed EAEC 
in 
1992, it has yet to take off chiefly because of Washington's 
cool stance toward the purely Asian grouping it views as a 
would-be trading bloc aiming to split the Asia-Pacific region. 
ASEAN last October agreed to dispatch Ajit to seek the views of 
Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan on EAEC, which 
Malaysia hopes will be launched this year. The concept was 
floated in late 1990 by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamed. 
  The report said officials in Japan, South Korea and China 
cautioned ASEAN to move gradually, with more discussions on 
defining EAEC's aims before the grouping can be established. 
Two main obstacles hampering the birth of EAEC are the U.S. 
position, which China termed the "key" to its launch, and 
Beijing's objections to Taiwan and Hong Kong joining as core 
members, the report said. 
  ASEAN economic ministers, who discussed the report at their 
informal retreat in Malaysia last week, said the association 
will brief the U.S. for the first time on EAEC when the two 
sides meet in Washington on May 9 and 10 for an annual dialogue. 
  The report had recommended ASEAN inform the U.S. of the 
group's EAEC plans as Washington's opinion was sought by 
officials in all three countries. Referring to the Japanese 
position, the report said Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro 
Matsuura suggested Australia and New Zealand be included within 
EAEC since Japan has close trade ties with and relies on them 
for resources and foodstuffs. Australia, which originally 
suggested the 17-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum in 1989, rejected joining the rival EAEC in unofficial 
overtures by Japanese Foreign Ministry officials early this 
year, according to ministry sources. But Japan, the report 
added, appeared to be the `odd man out' since neither China nor 
South Korea backed the membership of Australia and New Zealand. 
  ASEAN has ruled out the two countries and the U.S. from EAEC 
due to "geographic" reasons, but Malaysian officials have 
privately expressed qualms about Australia, which they see as a 
surrogate of the U.S. in the region. The report said Japan 
fears EAEC may affect the agenda of an already effective 
ASEAN-Japan annual trade dialogue, and that its potential to 
undermine APEC needs to be addressed by ASEAN to allay U.S. 
concern. An ASEAN official felt Japan was making too many 
excuses, but said he understood Japan's quandary of not wanting 
to antagonize Washington further amid the current U.S.-Japan 
trade dispute stemming from Tokyo's huge trade surplus. The 
report quoted Matsuura as questioning Ajit, "do we need an EAEC 
and what would it do since we have ASEAN and APEC? What is the 
purpose of EAEC?" 
  APEC includes Japan, the U.S., China and the ASEAN members 
of 
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and 
Thailand. Some ASEAN members fear the U.S. is manipulating APEC 
for its own economic interests. The report suggested that with 
China's strong backing for EAEC, ASEAN should reassess Ajit's 
planned visits to Hong Kong and Taiwan to avoid sending the 
"wrong signals" to Beijing. While China was flexible on Hong 
Kong, it strongly opposes Taiwan joining as a core EAEC member, 
though it is open to Taiwan's participation later on. Taiwanese 
officials have said Taipei is willing to join EAEC at its 
founding with "equal footing" and rights as other members. 
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan urged ASEAN to have 
prudence on the politically sensitive matter, especially since 
Taiwan has been using "elastic diplomacy" in trying to assert 
its independence. Taiwan and Hong Kong joined APEC as 
"economies" rather than countries to appease Beijing. 
  The report said South Korea has offered to act as a mediator 
for ASEAN with the U.S. and Japan on EAEC, which Seoul is keen 
to assist in the development of its structure, although Seoul 
has yet to decide on membership. The report quoted Foreign 
Minister Hang Sung-chu as saying he would be happy to see EAEC 
"getting off the ground" and that its issues should not overlap 
with APEC's.

  [Text] Hanoi, May 3 (AFP) -- Vietnam described Tuesday as 
"lies" allegations by the Khmer Rouge [KR] that the Cambodian 
government was attempting to recruit Vietnamese mercenaries to 
fight the guerrillas. 
  "This information is a complete lie," a Vietnamese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman told AFP of a Khmer Rouge radio report on 
Sunday which said government officials had travelled to Vietnam 
"to beg for 20 truckloads of mercenaries to come to the aid of 
defeated government troops in Battambang." 
  Khmer Rouge radio had said government defeats at Anlong Veng 
and Pailin -- guerrilla bases in Cambodia's north and northwest 
taken by government troops but lost again to the Khmer Rouge -- 
had made the recruitment of new soldiers impossible. 
  The guerrilla faction often blames Hanoi for interfering in 
Cambodia, where dozens of ethnic Vietnamese, including women and 
children, have been victims in bloody attacks blamed on the 
Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 1 KYODO -- Elusive backroom coalition 
strategist Ichiro Ozawa left for Britain Sunday [1 May], but 
neither he nor his aides would discuss details of the trip. 
  In a petition for rubber stamp Diet approval, Ozawa, 
secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], said only 
that he will inspect social and economic conditions in Britain. 
  His office simply said the trip is private. 
  Ozawa, 51, visited Britain and Italy in March. 
  News magazine reports said Ozawa's rather frequent overseas 
trips are related to the treatment of his heart ailment. 
  On Monday, new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), will leave for Italy, France, 
Germany and Belgium.

  [Text] Rome, May 3 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata said Tuesday [3 May] the next general election for 
the House of Representatives should be held under a new 
electoral system. 
  Hata, who arrived in Rome earlier in the day on the first 
leg 
of a six-day official visit to Italy, France, Germany and 
Belgium, said the prime minister's power to dissolve the lower 
house cannot be denied under any circumstances. 
  "However, looking into the reality, the Japanese people hope 
for an election under a new system. And basically, I am not 
thinking about dissolution now at all," Hata told Japanese 
reporters traveling with him. 
  Bills centered on a change in the lower house electoral 
system became law in late January. 
  Under the new system, 300 members are to be elected from 
single- seat constituencies and the remaining 200 through a 
proportional representation system. The present 511-seat lower 
chamber was elected from the multiseat constituencies. 
  But the new system will not take effect until the 
single-seat 
constituencies are delineated in several months. 
  Hata suggested it may take less than a three-month period 
for 
voters to learn the locations after they become law. 
  "Some people think it is easier to restore their power under 
the current system, but it is shameful to hold an election based 
on such thought," Hata said, referring to opinions of some 
members in the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] 
and new party Sakigake [Harbinger], both of which left the 
coalition recently. 
  The premier inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday, after 
the SDP withdrew when other ruling parties formed a new 
parliamentary group, "Kaishin" (Innovation), without consulting 
the SDP. 
  "I will urge the SDP to reconsider. In apologizing for what 
happened, I want to appeal to the SDP before anything else," he 
said. 
  Hata also said he does not rule out the possibility of an 
alignment of his party, Shinseito, and the leading opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), but an appeal to the SDP takes 
precedence. 
  The LDP surrendered its 38-year grip on power last August, 
when it failed to maintain a majority in the lower house. 
  Sakigake, led by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura, was a coalition government member before it defected. 
It supports the Hata administration but refused to send 
personnel to his new cabinet. 
  In relation to North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program, 
Hata pledged that Japan will deal problems with care and "within 
the framework of the (war-renouncing) constitution." 
  His remark reflects caution on legislation to deal with 
emergencies, including possible international sanctions against 
North Korea. 
  Hata also said he will seek the public's acceptance of 
higher 
indirect taxes, saying, "A graying society is at hand. It will 
be difficult to secure necessary financial sources working only 
with income taxes." He declined to mention the amount or timing 
of a tax increase.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Hata is currently visiting Italy. 
Speaking with Japanese correspondents in Rome this evening, Hata 
ruled out holding general elections once the House of 
Representatives is dissolved, asserting that the next general 
elections should be held under the new electoral system. In 
this way, the prime minister ruled out holding the general 
elections under the present multi-seat constituency system once 
the House of Representatives is dissolved. 
  While speaking with Japanese correspondents, Hata stated 
that 
generally speaking the Japanese prime minister possesses the 
right to dissolve the House of Representatives as his sole 
right, and the exercise of his right cannot be denied. The 
prime minister went on to say: Now that a new electoral system 
has been adopted, I believe the people hope the next general 
elections will be held under that new system. However, some 
politicians feel that if the next general elections are held 
under the current electoral system, it will be easier for their 
parties to increase their seats. 
  Touching on the need to make the people fully understand the 
changes in the current demarcation of constituencies that will 
occur after a bill on the demarcation of single-seat 
constituencies is enacted in the Diet, the prime minister 
stated: Most of the people already understand the need to 
change the current demarcation of constituencies. The present 
situation is somewhat different from that of five or six years 
ago. A certain period of time is needed to make the people 
understand the new electoral system. 
  While speaking with Japanese correspondents, the prime 
minister stressed he will call on the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] to return to the coalition to secure a majority in 
the Diet, stating: I intend to seek cooperation from the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] on our policies, and I 
cannot deny the possibility of creating a new framework as a 
result of policy cooperation with the LDP. The realignment of 
political parties is under way, and there is a possibility a 
grand coalition will be formed in the future. [passage omitted 
on Hata's itinerary in Italy]

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Akira Yamagishi, chairman 
of the eight-million-strong Japanese Trade Union Confederation 
(Rengo), on Thursday [28 April] suggested that his organization 
will keep a distance from the new coalition government formed by 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Yamagishi called it "regrettable" that the new coalition 
failed to maintain the framework as it existed under former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  He said that Rengo, which had cooperated with the Hosokawa 
cabinet, would point out rights and wrongs as it sees them in 
assessing the policies of the Hata cabinet. 
  Rengo is Japan's largest federation of trade unions.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- The cabinet of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata got a 50.1 percent approval rating in a weekend 
poll of 662 voters, TV Asahi reported Monday [2 May]. 
  On Sunday, KYODO NEWS SERVICE's telephone poll of 1,000 
voters showed that 51.6 percent supported the Hata cabinet. 
  In Monday night's "News Station" program, TV Asahi said 31.9 
percent disapproved of the Hata cabinet, launched last Thursday. 
  Just before Hata was elected prime minister last Monday, the 
TV station conducted a similar survey which showed a 66.8 
percent approval rating for Hata's incoming cabinet. During the 
one-week period, the support rating fell 16.7 percentage points, 
TV Asahi said. 
  Following Hata's election in the Diet as Japan's 51st prime 
minister, the biggest coalition group, the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP), quit the alliance in protest against the swift 
formation of a large parliamentary group that excluded the SDP. 
  The TV Asahi poll also showed that 54 percent expressed 
support for the SDP's withdrawal from the coalition while 27 
percent disapproved of it. 
  Asked who is at the center of the new coalition, 52 percent 
named key coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general 
of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], while 21 percent nominated 
Hata who is Shinseito head and 4 percent picked former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP). 
  The poll also showed that 54 percent of pollees wanted the 
SDP to follow its own path, and 32 percent called for its 
cooperation with the Hata cabinet. Only 10 percent proposed the 
SDP cooperate with the largest opposition party, the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Asked how long the Hata cabinet will survive, 44 percent 
replied around half a year, followed by 23 percent who predicted 
three months and 18 percent one year or longer. The poll showed 
9 percent replied two months, and 2 percent one month. 
  It said 60 percent called for an early general election for 
the House of Representatives after the Diet passes the fiscal 
1994 budget, compared with 27 percent who did not.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- The new coalition cabinet of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata scored a 62.1 percent support rating 
in a joint nationwide telephone survey by the SANKEI SHIMBUN and 
Fuji Television network published Monday [2 May]. 
  But nearly 70 percent of the 2,000 respondents called for an 
early general election in the wake of the pullout of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- 
SDPJ] from the coalition, the SANKEI SHIMBUN said. 
  The public disapproval rate for the cabinet among the 
pollees 
was 17.6 percent, the newspaper said. 
  The public support rating of the Hata cabinet is 21.3 
percentage points lower than that of the cabinet of Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata's predecessor, last August, but 
is still higher than the rating of previous cabinets of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the newspaper said. 
  The support rate for the cabinet of Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita on its inauguration in November 1987 was 53 percent 
and that for the cabinet of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in 
November 1991 was 54.9 percent, the SANKEI said. 
  Of the 62.1 percent backing the Hata cabinet, 29.4 percent 
declared they support it unconditionally, while 32.7 percent 
said that if they have to choose, they support the newly 
launched cabinet, the SANKEI said. 
  The SANKEI and Fuji Television Network conducted the survey 
on Friday and Saturday. 
  Of the pollees, 45.1 percent cited pump-priming as the most 
important policy for the Hata cabinet, followed by 21.1 percent 
stressing tax reform, 14.9 percent political reform, and 8.4 
percent the rice issue, according to the SANKEI. 
  A large proportion -- 61.5 percent -- of the respondents 
support the pullout of the SDP from the coalition. 
  The LDP, the largest opposition party, garnered 22.3 percent 
support, followed by 11.3 percent for Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], headed by Hata. 
  In a KYODO NEWS SERVICE public opinion poll released Sunday, 
the Hata cabinet posted a 51.6 percent public approval rating, 
down 24.1 percentage points from that for the Hosokawa cabinet 
last August.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi </F>
Kumagai by political commentator Soichiro Tahara, Kyoto 
University Professor Masaaki Kosaka, and political commentator 
Yoichi Masuzoe in Tokyo; from the "Sunday Project" program; date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Tahara] Let me congratulate you first. Now I 
want to ask you whether it is true that you did not want to take 
the post of chief cabinet secretary? 
  [Kumagai] It is true. 
  [Tahara] So, you took the post reluctantly. 
  [Kumagai] I did not want to assume this important post at a 
time when the nation is in difficult times. I experienced 
neurasthenia for the first time. 
  [Tahara] To tell you the truth, we also think that you are 
fit to be the international trade and industry minister. 
Because Finance Minister Fujii has been retained in the same 
post, we also thought you would be retained as the international 
trade and industry minister. How come you have been appointed 
as chief cabinet secretary? 
  [Kumagai] Well, this would not have happened if the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan had remained in the coalition. With 
the reduced number of members, the ruling coalition has to deal 
not only with party affairs but also cabinet tasks. So, it was 
inevitable for me to accept the post. 
  [Tahara] Some reporters told me that Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa has sent you to the 
cabinet as his other self. Is this true? 
  [Kumagai] I am often called an aide to Mr. Ozawa. I was 
when I and Mr. Ozawa were in the same faction. But now I argue 
with him and sometimes oppose what he says. Subjectively 
speaking, I am not his aide. But because I have worked with 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata for a long time, I can say I serve 
as a bridge between Ozawa and Hata. 
  [Tahara] Mr. Ozawa is often criticized as being dictatorial 
and for his arbitrary decision-making together with [Komeito 
Secretary General] Yuichi Ichikawa. Is what has been said about 
him true? 
  [Kumagai] I think there are some points in his political 
style that he should reflect on. But what has been said about 
him is untrue. He is a poor talker and not a careful tactician. 
He usually makes a frontal attack. He does not conduct 
behind-the-scenes negotiations, even when we expect him to do so. 
  [Tahara] Some say he is slovenly. 
  [Kumagai] Rather than calling him slovenly, I would say he 
can do no more than making a frontal attack. 
  [Tahara] So he is like a baseball pitcher who can throw only 
a fast ball? 
  [Kumagai] Yes, he is just like a pitcher who can throw only 
a fast ball at the speed of 170 km three times and does nothing 
else the rest of the game. 
  [Tahara] I would like to ask about the uproar caused by the 
formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin." When the SDPJ 
secretary general appeared on this program recently, I asked him 
whether Ozawa and Komeito's Ichikawa really make decisions 
arbitrarily in the coalition. Kubo's answer was no. So I 
thought Kubo was on good terms with Ozawa. Do you not think the 
uproar would not have occurred if Ozawa had made just one call 
to Kubo? 
  [Kumagai] I do not know. We had only a vague idea that a 
new parliamentary group might be gradually formed toward the end 
of the current Diet session. We thought if the formation of a 
new group was planned that day, only small parties would come 
together and announce the formation of Kaishin. But things 
progressed before we knew what was happening. 
  [Tahara] I also thought only the Democratic Socialist Party 
and the Japan New Party would participate in the group. 
  [Kumagai] In his political concept, Mr. Ozawa has the desire 
to form two major political forces and then establish a 
two-party system. Because an unexpected person moved to form 
the group, I think Mr. Ozawa lost control of himself and took 
the opportunity. 
  [Tahara] So he is careless. (laughing) 
  [Kumagai] Yes, I think he is. 
  [Tahara] That is one thing I wanted to ask you today. 
In connection with our earlier discussion, the fact is the 
ruling parties hold only one-third of the lower house seats and 
only one-fourth of the upper house seats. The cabinet is very 
much a minority administration. Some term this a caretaker 
government for the next election, or for the passage of the 
budget. How do you intend to carry on? 
  [Kumagai] This is not what we originally planned. If we had 
enough time, we would have engaged in more patient persuasion of 
the SDPJ and Sakigake to remain in the coalition. It is a 
shame, because we had agreed on Hata as prime minister, although 
there was a procedural fault; we also reached a basic agreement 
on policy. It would have been merely a question of how to start 
with a clean slate to make up for the procedural mistake, and it 
would have been necessary to work by all means to persuade them 
to return to the coalition. However, the Diet session had been 
suspended due to various issues. Then the air crash occurred in 
Nagoya, the budget remained untouched, and nothing was being 
done about the economy which was starting to show initial signs 
of recovery. Many things were left undone. This affected the 
people's livelihood. Thus, in a sense we had to take off 
because of the time limit. 
  I personally believe that although the SDPJ is saying it is 
impossible for them to return to the coalition since agreements 
have been reached on basic policies, based on this policy accord 
and on the consensus that Hata is the right man we need to keep 
our door open and work to tenaciously persuade them to return to 
the coalition. 
  There is also deliberation on the budget. We need to 
continue to discuss tax reform. It is important to close the 
gap in our discussion process. 
  [Tahara] If you intend to bring Sakigake [Harbinger] and the 
SDPJ back into the coalition, would it not have been better to 
give them ministerial posts? 
  [Kumagai] Oh, no. If we do that.... 
  [Tahara, interrupting] For instance, Komeito and Shinseito 
hold many cabinet posts. Are some of them not just temporary 
occupants [kuseki join] of these positions who will make way for 
returning SDPJ and Sakigake cabinet members? 
  [Kumagai] No, that is not the case. 
  [Tahara] A number of them do not seem to be competent. 
  [Kumagai] In the event they come back, we will have to 
reshuffle the cabinet. 
  [Tahara] A reshuffle? 
  [Kumagai] I am not talking about any particular person. 
With regard to the budget, the SDPJ and Sakigake say they will 
cooperate because they took part in formulating it. They say 
they will cooperate in passing budget-related bills. Once the 
budget is passed, we will have to engage in preparatory 
discussions and lay the groundwork for asking them back. 
  [Tahara] I think they will cooperate. They will probably 
cooperate in passing the draft budget because the SDPJ also took 
part in formulating it. 
  It is said the Diet will be dissolved after approving the 
budget. As a matter of fact, a survey conducted by Voice Inc. 
[name as heard] shows many people want the Diet to be dissolved. 
Of course, if the Diet is dissolved, an election will be held 
under the new election system. Do you agree? 
  [Kumagai] Of course. All preparations have been made. 
Members of the deliberation panel [the electoral redistricting 
panel on new constituency boundaries for the House of 
Representatives] were selected in April. As far as the system 
is concerned, we are supposed to start Diet deliberations on the 
redistricting bills within six months of the members being 
selected. However, the agreement among the ruling parties, 
including the SDPJ, says they will try to enact the 
redistricting bills during the current Diet session. It is said 
that procedures to enact the bills take time. However, we are 
having endless discussions compared to the discussions the LDP 
had during the Kaifu administration. We are preparing ourselves 
to listen to the opinions of local cities. The next step is to 
map out fundamental ideas needed to enact the bills. Once we 
have this yardstick, then the remaining problems will be 
technical matters. All we have to do is to actually rezone the 
precincts according to the plan. It is not a dream at all to 
start Diet deliberations during the current Diet session if the 
members of the working group work energetically. 
  [Tahara] Suppose an election is held under the new 
system. When do you think is the earliest it will be held? 
  [Kumagai] We can hold it around July. 
  [Tahara] What? Masuzoe, would you listen to this for a 
moment? Do you think an election can be held in July? 
  [Masuzoe] It can be done if we want. 
  [Kumagai] It is not something we can force. 
  [Tahara] I mean, if it is possible. 
  [Kumagai] Our fundamental understanding is that the current 
Diet session will end on 29 July. The coalition and the SDPJ 
have had discussions and have agreed to complete its 
deliberations during the current Diet session. 
  [Tahara] Does it mean the current Diet session may be 
extended? Will it be extended in order to rezone the precincts? 
  [Kumagai] It will cause problems if a government official 
says such things. What I mean to say is that it is possible if 
we can reach an agreement. 
  [Tahara] Is it possible to extend the Diet session? 
  [Kumagai] Yes. 
  [Tahara] Would you like to pass redistricting bills even if 
you have to extend the term of the current Diet session? 
  [Kumagai] As you know, Tsutomu Hata became chairman of the 
Election System Research Council when the Kaifu administration 
was inaugurated following the Recruit scandal. In other words, 
he was the first LDP member who stood up for the reform. 
  [Tahara] You mean election system reform? 
  [Kumagai] Yes. That was his starting point. To Tsutomu 
Hata, adoption of redistricting bills will put an end to his 
quest. 
  [Tahara] It has to end. 
  [Kumagai] He has to complete what he started to talk about 
in front of the people, otherwise he cannot rest. 
  [Tahara] Let me go back to what we were discussing earlier. 
Do you think July is too early, even if relevant bills are 
approved by extending the term of the current Diet session? 
Masuzoe said earlier the election would be held in September. 
  [Masuzoe] An election has to be held within six months. 
Initially, three months was required for public notification. 
Six months plus three months is nine months. However, nobody 
needs a three-month notification because people watch TV. They 
will know it right away. Also, there are 300 seats in total. 
There will be no change in the total number of seats; only 
minor changes are needed. If you make a change in one district, 
then you have to make a change in other districts. The council 
can inform us about new constituency boundaries tomorrow if we 
ask them to. 
  [Tahara] This means that an election, no matter how soon it 
may be held, can be held under the new election system. 
  [Masuzone] There will be no problem at all from a legal 
point of view. 
  [Kumagai] Masuzone is quite right. However, it is necessary 
for the panel members to come up with a yardstick, or to listen 
to the opinions of local autonomies once again. They need to 
fulfill the minimum requirements. Therefore, it is impossible 
for them to submit the bills in May. They need to work hard for 
a certain period of time. Moreover, politicians' opinions 
should be reflected in the bills, otherwise the bill will never 
be approved. 
  [Tahara] I have a feeling half of the politicians do not 
want political reform. 
  [Kumagai] It is more than half. 
  [Tahara] More than half of the politicians? 
  [Kumagai] Including myself. 
  [Tahara] Are you saying you are included in the half of the 
politicians who do not want political reform? 
  [Kumagai] No, I am not. I mean to say that I benefited 
from the election system for medium precincts. This is an 
imaginary destruction. In other words, we grudgingly agreed and 
pledged to the people that we would make changes by destroying 
the election system for medium precincts. We should be ashamed 
if we break that promise. 
  [Masuzoe] Is it possible to pass redistricting bills before 
approving the budget? 
  [Kumagai] Theoretically, it is possible. 
  [Masuzoe] That means you can insist on saying you cannot 
pass the budget unless redistricting bills are approved. 
  [Kumagai] Well, I cannot say that. The Diet, which will 
begin on Monday, will be turned upside down if I said that. 
[laughing] I have to remain cool as much as possible. 
  [Tahara] The Hata administration is determined to approve 
the budget and redistricting bills during the current Diet 
session even at the risk of extending the Diet session. 
  [Kumagai] The Hata cabinet has to enact by all means the 
1994 budget bill and the bills on new constituency boundaries 
during the current Diet session. 
  [Tahara] Do we still have enough time? We do? There is 
another thing I would like to talk about. It's about the Korean 
peninsula issue. I hope a war will not break out on the Korean 
peninsula. However, how is Japan going to deal with an 
emergency situation? The Japanese people think about this 
issue. UN Forces or the U.S. military will be dispatched if war 
breaks out. Well, the foreign minister said today on another TV 
program that we need to change various things in order to deal 
with such an emergency. Do you think we need to make legal 
preparations? What do you think? 
  [Kumagai] Well, the foreign minister.... 
  [Tahara, interrupting] He was referring to the Self-Defense 
Force Law. He was talking about the possibility of revising the 
law. 
  [Kumagai] Well, regarding the Self-Defense Law, a bill was 
already submitted to the Diet. We went through a bitter 
experience. 
  [Tahara] Some are asking what Japan can do. Some say we 
should introduce a law only for a limited period of time. As a 
matter of fact, Komeito's Secretary General Yuuichi Ichikawa 
said during this program last week that we should take 
legislative actions. What do you think, Kumagai? 
  [Kumagai] The Hosokawa administration said Japan will act 
within the scope of the Constitution. The administration did 
not say within the scope of laws because.... 
  [Tahara, interrupting] This means new laws can be 
introduced. 
  [Kumagai] That is correct. We have to do that as a matter 
of course. However, negotiations on the North Korean issue are 
coming to the final stage. The UN is trying to settle the issue 
peacefully on the basis of the UNSC statement. Negotiations 
with the DPRK are entering their final stage. Judging from the 
tacit rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency, it is not 
a good idea at this stage to threaten the DPRK by hinting at the 
possibility of taking military action. I think we should 
prudently deal with the issue. However, we have to prepare 
ourselves for various cases, and this is another story. It is 
true that the government has studied necessary measures. 
  [Tahara] Masuzoe, what do you think about this issue? 
Do you have any opinions? 
  [Masuzoe] For example, in case we need to rescue Japanese 
citizens living abroad, the issue of revising the Self-Defense 
Forces [SDF] Law will naturally arise. 
  [Kumagai] A related bill has been submitted to the Diet, but 
it has not been easy to enact. 
  [Masuzoe] There is also the question of how to deal with 
"nyukan ho" [the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition 
Act] in case refugees come to Japan. Moreover, when the United 
Nations adopts a resolution calling for sanctions against North 
Korea, and the sanctions include a ban on remittances to North 
Korea by "Chosen Soren" [General Association of Korean 
Residents], will Japan fully implement them? I do not think 
"gaitame ho" [the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control 
Law] is sufficient to that end. If the critical scenario for 
this situation becomes reality in a month, Japan will not have 
enough time to deal with these issues. Do you think these 
issues will cause the cabinet to collapse? 
  [Kosaka] I think it is necessary to form a large coalition 
government. The current cabinet has the capability of dealing 
with these issues, or the people would not have empowered the 
cabinet to do so. This is because the cabinet is a minority 
administration. I am talking about a possible scenario. 
Although I do not want to say this, the government should have 
started making preparations for North Korea's nuclear issue two 
years ago. Since there is confusion in the administration, it 
has no choice but to apologize to the public. 
  [Kumagai] Most people, including the Hata cabinet, know what 
we should do if events occur. They know this well. I am not 
saying we are studying necessary measures. However, if we spell 
out our policy during peace time when nothing is happening, this 
will create much confusion due to the current political 
situation. However, we understand North Korea is serious and 
the situation is fast developing into a reality. It is true we 
are now studying what we should do. Once a consensus is 
reached, it will be possible for us to establish a crisis 
control system in a heartbeat. 
  [Tahara] Do you mean that although the government should not 
talk about such things while nothing is happening, it can 
properly deal with the situation when something happens? Do you 
think the government needs to take legislative measures? 
  [Kumagai] To that end, a political procedure is necessary. 
As you said, since we are minority ruling parties we cannot do 
everything in haste. After all, the establishment of a 
political foundation or mainstream thinking will naturally be a 
precondition for adopting political procedures. 
  [Masuzoe] My opinion runs counter to yours. Because the 
government has not studied the necessary measures in a 
cool-headed manner during peace time, including adopting 
legislation in case of an emergency, there is a possibility that 
if Japan decides to revise the SDF Law for the purpose of 
rescuing overseas Japanese, this will worsen relations with 
South Korea. It is rather dangerous for the government to enact 
emergency defense legislation when it is terribly upset by a 
serious situation. If you enact legislation, do you intend to 
do so without going through the legal formalities? 
  [Kumagai] No, it is impossible for us to violate the law. 
This issue....[pauses] However, we do not think the situation 
will suddenly develop into a military collision. What measures 
the United Nations will take in the future depends on the next 
moves by North Korea. In dealing with the Gulf war, the United 
Nations spent almost half a year accumulating its resolutions in 
a persistent manner, and it gradually reached its final decision 
while observing Iraqi reaction. While watching developments at 
the United Nations, we need to appeal to the public regarding 
necessary measures; the government may need to change its policy 
depending on these developments. We have created conditions to 
that end. 
  [Kosaka] It is good to prepare for various scenarios. We 
should do so during peace time. Therefor we must make 
preparations now--for example, a measure to rescue Japanese 
living abroad. But if we cannot do that, we need to accept the 
situation. Because we have not made preparations so far, it 
would be better not to enact an emergency legislation. In that 
case, the government needs to apologize to the United States and 
the international community for not participating in their 
actions, and must apologize to those citizens living abroad for 
being unable to rescue them. If the administration is not 
supported by the entire nation after making such an apology, it 
cannot deal with the situation. But I do not think such a 
scenario will occur. If my expectations are wrong, I will 
apologize. [laughter] 
  [Tahara] Mr. Kumagai, the issue of the tax system must be 
considered in addition to the electoral system and budget issues. 
  [Kumagai] This is a major issue. 
  [Tahara] Do you intend to solve the tax issue during the 
current Diet session? 
  [Kumagai] No, we hope to enact relevant bills by the end of 
this year. To that end, we need to reach an accord among the 
ruling parties, including the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ], which used to be a ruling party. 
  [Tahara] Do you hope to do so by around the end of June? 
  [Kumagai] The current Diet session will end on 29 June. So 
I mean during the current Diet session. 
  [Tahara] Do you hope to have a general plan for tax reform 
during the current Diet session? 
  [Kumagai] Yes. 
  [Tahara] Now that the SDPJ has become an opposition party, 
do you think the SDPJ intends to reach an accord with the 
coalition? 
  [Kumagai] Like the issue of North Korea, this issue is a 
major topic of the nine-point policy agreement, which was 
reached among the ruling parties, including the SDPJ. The SDPJ 
made bold to make concessions on this issue. There will be 
various arguments on the details of the agreement. I think we 
need to solemnly continue our efforts. As such, it is not 
appropriate for us to promote work by ourselves without 
consulting with the SDPJ. We need to continue to keep our door 
open to the SDPJ and to seek its views. While communicating 
with the SDPJ through such measures, we would like the party to 
return to its past stance in line with the coalition. 
  [Tahara] Do you need to urge the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] to help as well? 
  [Kumagai] This is a matter of course. An additional clause 
of the previous bill on special tax reductions stipulated 
partial reform of the tax system. In a sense, this was the 
LDP's proposal. For this reason, we need to urge the LDP to 
cooperate in dealing with this issue. 
  [Tahara] Mr. Kosaka, do you have anything else you want to 
ask of the new administration? You may make one more request. 
  [Kosaka] Well, no matter what, the administration should not 
be too hasty. There is an old saying about waiting until the 
time is ripe, but everyone, including Mr. Ozawa and Mr. Kumagai, 
seems to have forgotten this. You should think about this. 
Three months have already passed since February, but in this 
period there has been commotion over a national welfare tax or a 
reshuffling of the cabinet. Who would want to [words 
indistinct] at such a busy time? If they had passed the budget 
bill and worked out the new electorate divisions during that 
time, they would be happy right now. The last three months have 
shown how bad things can turn out to be when you rush things. 
  [Kumagai] Well, they certainly say "walk but do not run." 
  [Tahara] Well, maybe that has something to do with your 
earlier remarks about Mr. Ozawa's character -- that he is a 
hasty person... short-tempered. 
  [Kumagai] Well, he is always very direct. 
  [Tahara] You mean throwing fast, straight balls only? 
  [Kumagai] Yes, like he does not like to beat around the 
bushes. 
  [Tahara] I think you could tell Mr. Ozawa to stop doing 
this. 
  [Kumagai] Yes, that is right. Not only by myself, but 
together with Prime Minister Hata. I think this is a question 
of style. 
  [Tahara] Do you think Prime Minister Hata can do this? 
  [Kumagai] Well, Prime Minister Hata is quite stubborn. As 
prime minister, he would be the only person who could stand up 
to Mr. Ozawa's fast balls. When he is really determined -- I am 
talking about Prime Minister Hata -- then you had better watch 
out.

  [Text] Otsu, May 2 KYODO -- The leader of new party 
Sakigake [Harbinger] voiced support for an extension of the 
current Diet session Monday [2 May] to pass a bill instrumental 
for holding House of Representatives elections based on 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. 
  Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura told a news conference in 
Otsu that deliberation of the bill delineating new single-seat 
constituencies would take "until late July or August." 
  The current Diet session ends June 29. 
  Under the current election system, the 511 lower house 
members are elected from three- to five-seat constituencies. 
  Takemura, chief cabinet secretary under the cabinet of 
former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, said he hopes that the next 
lower house elections will be held "if at all possible" under 
the new election system combining proportional representation 
and direct elections in single-seat constituencies. 
  He said, however, that further political turmoil could make 
it necessary to call a general election before the new election 
system has been established. 
  "We would have no reason to wait if political turmoil made 
it 
mandatory to hear the will of the people," he said. 
  Takemura also decried as "not good" that certain parties 
have 
"seized" government power in an apparent reference to the new 
coalition centering on Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, which is backed by the Soka 
Gakkai Buddhist lay organization. 
  Sakigake, which belonged to the seven-party coalition that 
ousted the Liberal Democratic Party from power in August after 
almost four decades of unchallenged rule, refused to take posts 
in the Hata cabinet but pledged support for the minority 
government. 
  But the sudden formation of the new parliamentary group 
Kaishin, which includes Shinseito and Hosokawa's Japan New 
Party, has created "an unusual situation," said Takemura in 
explaining why Sakigake decided to stay out of the Hata cabinet.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- About half of Diet 
legislators surveyed want a two-party system in Japan's future 
politics, replacing the current multiparty setup, an influential 
private group promoting political reform said Tuesday [3 May]. 
  Of the lawmakers surveyed, 50.3 percent prefer a two-party 
system, 39.3 percent favor a moderate multiparty system with 
three or more parties, and 3.5 percent like a long and stable 
rule by a single party, according to a poll conducted by the 
Committee for the Promotion of Political Reform. 
  The group of dozens of voluntary members from business, 
labor, academic and journalistic circles sent questionnaires to 
761 lawmakers of both houses, 239 business executives and 78 
labor unionists from April 1 to 22, committee members said. Of 
the legislators, 59.5 percent responded, they said. 
  According to the survey, 20.3 percent of the lawmakers said 
most existing parties will disappear in political realignment. 
  As to the timing of such realignment, 58.6 percent of the 
Diet members said it will take place in a year and 12.4 percent 
said in several years, they said. 
  A two-party system was sought by 88.5 percent of respondents 
from Komeito [Clean Government Party], a Buddhist-backed party 
in the coalition, 87.3 percent from Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], a key party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, and 60.9 
percent from the Democratic Socialist Party, another ruling 
party, they said. 
  A moderate multiparty system was backed by 70.8 percent of 
members of the Japan New Party led by former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The figure was identical for the Social Democratic Party, 
which defected the coalition last week, and 50 percent for new 
party Sakigake [Harbinger] led by former Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura. Sakigake refused to take new cabinet 
positions, they said. 
  The biggest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was 
split, with 45.6 percent favoring a two-party system and 41.8 
percent support a moderate multiparty system, they said. The 
LDP surrendered its 38-year grip on power last August. 
  Members of the opposition Japanese Communist Party did not 
answer the survey, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Japanese companies plan to 
cut their capital spending for the third straight year in fiscal 
1994 but the declines are shrinking, the government said 
Wednesday [27 April]. 
  The quarterly Economic Planning Agency report also found 
growing hopes of an economic recovery, but an official cautioned 
that it would be hasty to read the survey as showing the economy 
hitting bottom in its longest postwar recession. 
  Companies plan to cut their spending on plant and equipment 
by 9.2 percent to 40 trillion yen in the fiscal year that 
started this month, the third year of declines in a row but 
narrowing from the fiscal 1993 cutback of 10.3 percent, the 
survey found. 
  Manufacturers' capital spending plans were down 17.6 percent 
for the third straight drop, compared with the previous year's 
18.7 percent decline, while nonmanufacturers plan a second 
straight cutback, with the decline narrowing to 5.0 percent from 
5.5 percent. 
  The agency canvassed 4,550 companies with capital of at 
least 
100 million yen on March 1, with 4,304 responding. 
  The agency's Business Survey Index found sentiment on the 
economy registering minus 3 for the April-June quarter, an 
improvement from the previous quarter's minus 22 reading. 
  "Cautious opinions among corporate managers about the 
domestic economy are easing and expectations of recovery are 
again emerging," the report said. 
  The index subtracts the percentage of companies seeing 
declines from those citing improvement. 
  The outlook for the quarter starting in July rises to plus 
13, but the official noted that projections for two quarters 
ahead have been positive since late 1992 even as the economy 
continued to slump.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Japanese import prices on 
items used in daily life fell 5.8 percent in March from a year 
before, influenced by the high yen, the Finance Ministry said 
Thursday [28 April]. 
  Of the 30 items surveyed, 25 fell in price from a year 
earlier, with 13 falling by double-digit percentages, a ministry 
official told reporters in releasing the monthly report. 
  The dollar's value against the yen fell 10.9 percent in 
March 
from a year before to an average 105.04 yen, he said. 
  Among the reasons that the average price decline was less 
than the increase in the yen's buying power, he said, was a 
number of imports contracted for in the Japanese currency and 
shifts in product preferences among certain categories. 
  Among the large decliners was frozen octopus, with falling 
production prices pushing the import price down 24.6 percent. 
  A switch to cheaper brands pushed European electric shaver 
prices down 39.5 percent and U.S. golf club prices down 19.9 
percent, the official said. 
  By contrast, import prices for British whiskey jumped 16.4 
percent. The official cited a statistical reaction to a large 
fall a year earlier as well as a shift to more expensive malted 
whiskies. 
  Strong U.S. demand for frozen shrimp and prawns pushed the 
Japanese import price up 1.0 percent and a switch to more 
expensive navel oranges pushed orange prices up 2.2 percent. 
  Lemon and lime prices, however, fell 13.4 percent and 
grapefruit 6.1 percent due mainly to the yen's rise, the 
official said. 
  Fresh and frozen beef prices fell 4.0 percent, with the 
effect of the high-yen dampened by rising production prices, he 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange 
reserves soared 2.83 billion dollars in April to hit a record 
for the second month in a row, the Finance Ministry said Monday 
[2 May]. 
  The new record of 104.56 billion dollars in the month-end 
balance endorsed the continued active intervention by the Bank 
of Japan to stem the yen's rise against the U.S. dollar. 
  The April rise also represented the sixth consecutive 
month-to- month increase, the ministry said. 
  The foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies, 
gold and international monetary fund special drawing rights. 
  A ministry official, as usual, declined to comment on 
details 
and reasons for the change in the foreign reserves while 
briefing reporters. 
  Market experts closely follow fluctuations in foreign 
reserves as evidence of intervention by the Bank of Japan and 
dealers said the central bank continued to buy billions of 
dollars in April to stop the yen's rise. 
  The ministry official said the dollar started the month at 
102.72 yen and ended at 102.38 yen in Tokyo dealings, ranging 
from 102.30 posted April 28 to 105.85 yen marked April 8. 
  He said the range of 3.55 yen was small compared with that 
in 
the past three months this year but noted that the dollar-yen 
rate fluctuated more in overseas markets. 
  The dealers said the central bank was also seen buying 
dollars overseas in the reporting month. 
  Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign 
reserves 
for the sixth month in a row, amassing 98.4 billion dollars as 
of February, the most recent comparable figures with other 
nations, except Taiwan for January reserves, the official said. 
  Taiwan came in second with reserves of 84.8 billion dollars, 
followed by Germany with 83.5 billion dollars. The United 
States posted 77.5 billion dollars and Spain 42.4 billion 
dollars.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly named Construction 
Minister Koji Morimoto said Thursday [28 April] he plans no 
change in the policy of the former government of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa to boost Japan's public works projects program 
for the current decade. 
  "I think the program should be expanded. I want to study it 
more," he told reporters at a news conference, his first as 
construction chief. 
  The former Hosokawa government decided to add more projects 
to the 430 trillion yen program, which was set up in line with 
Japan's agreement on the structural impediments initiative (SII) 
talks with the United States concluded in June 1990.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Orders obtained by 50 major 
Japanese construction firms in fiscal 1993 ended March 31 posted 
a 17.4 percent fall from the previous year to 18.91 trillion yen 
-- the third consecutive yearly decline, the Construction 
Ministry announced Thursday [28 April]. 
  Reflecting the continued recession, private-sector orders 
declined 22.7 percent to 11.2 trillion yen -- also the third 
straight yearly fall. 
  Public-sector orders also went down 10.7 percent to 6.41 
trillion yen -- the first year-on-year fall in eight years. 
  Ministry officials said public-sector orders fell because 
central and local governments barred the major construction 
companies involved in bribery scandals from making bids for some 
months by way of penalty. 
  Orders obtained in March, the last month of the fiscal year, 
by the 50 companies declined by 15 percent from the year before 
to 3.05 trillion yen -- the 14th monthly year-on-year fall in a 
row. 
  Private-sector orders plummeted 26.8 percent to 1.75 
trillion 
yen, while public-sector orders increased 10.2 percent to a 
record 1.11 trillion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, may 3 KYODO -- Of some 1,000 senior 
executives in 38 major Japanese construction companies, 238 were 
formerly bureaucrats in government ministries or officials of 
local autonomous bodies or of state-run corporations, a labor 
union report said Tuesday [3 May]. 
  Of the 238 executives, 67 were from the Construction 
Ministry, 30 were from the Agricultural, Forestry and Fisheries 
Ministry, 18 from the Transport Ministry and 15 from local 
governments, according to the 6,500-member union formed by 
workers at public corporations. 
  It spent about 18 months analyzing lists naming retired 
bureaucrats from ministries and tracked their next steps, as 
part of its efforts to look into the practice of "amakudari." 
  "Amakudari," literally meaning descent from heaven, is a 
common practice in which retired bureaucrats are hired by 
companies or public corporations having connections with the 
ministries. 
  The union also surveyed the whereabouts of 440 retired 
career 
bureaucrats from the Construction Ministry, with cooperation 
from construction firms' labor unions, union officials said. 
  Of those, 204 were working at private-sector firms, 177 at 
nonprofit organizations under the jurisdiction of the 
Construction Ministry, 49 were at state-run corporations, while 
20 had become politicians and 12 professors, it said. 
Twenty-two of the retired bureaucrats held multiple posts, it 
added. 
  Of the 440 retirees, the union discovered that 111 had been 
accepted by companies after they had worked at nonprofit 
organizations or state-run corporations, union officials said. 
  The National Public Service law bans bureaucrats from 
working 
at companies related to their previous ministry duties for two 
years after retirement, but they are free to go to public firms. 
  Some bureaucrats were hired by companies via public 
corporations apparently because of the regulation, the officials 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Japan's new car sales in 
April fell 6.6 percent from a year before to 372,755 vehicles 
but down by a sharp 45.1 percent from the previous month, an 
automobile industry group said Monday [2 May]. 
  Sales of passenger cars fell by 6.1 percent to 259,249, 
while 
those of trucks declined 7.4 percent to 111,801, the Japan 
Automobile Dealers Association said. 
  Bus sales fell 21.5 percent from a year earlier to 1,705. 
  Of the passenger cars, sales of cars with engine capacity of 
more than 2 liters grew for the first time in six months, rising 
1.2 percent to 51,782. 
  Sales of passenger cars with engine sizes ranging from 660 
cc 
to 2000 cc fell 7.8 percent to 207,467, continuing the decline 
that started in April last year. 
  All the major automakers except Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. 
saw sales dropping. 
  Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest automaker, saw its sales 
in April fall 7.0 percent from a year earlier, while No. 2 
Nissan Motor Co. registered a 16.3 percent decline, and Honda 
Motor Co. an 18.4 percent drop. 
  In contrast, imported car sales jumped 45.0 percent from 
April last year to 24,253 vehicles, the association said. 
  Fuji enjoyed a 55.3 percent rise in sales due to its 
"Legacy" 
model which was popular following the renewal of its type last 
year. 
  In March, the decline in overall sales shrank to 3.8 
percent, 
and hopes have spread in the auto industry that sales figures 
would recover, particularly with the reduction of the car 
consumption tax from 4.5 percent to 3 percent in April. 
  However, the companies went too far in March in discounting 
auto prices ahead of the consumption tax cut and the fall in 
April was a natural response to the boost in sales during March, 
said an official at the association. 
  "I'm afraid a recovery might be delayed until the latter 
part 
of this year," the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Japan's "big four" 
brokerage houses have started preparations for the use of 
multimedia system for home stock trading, industry officials 
said Wednesday [27 April]. 
  The officials said Daiwa Securities Co. has formed a team of 
experts to study ways to enable customers to engage in stock 
trading at home using the interactive system. 
  Customers can call up on the screen all necessary data, 
including the business results of interested firms and economic 
indexes while listening to advice from salespeople, they said. 
  Similar studies are being made by three other brokerages, 
including Nomura Securities Co., the officials said. 
  They said investors will be able to engage in stock trading 
at home when the multimedia system for home use is introduced. 
  The securities companies introduced home trading in 1988 
using television game machines, but the existing system cannot 
meet the needs of customers because the volume of information 
provided is limited.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- The group governing 
agricultural cooperatives said Tuesday [26 April] it has drafted 
a proposal for agriculture reconstruction, centering on a review 
of the controversial Food Control Law. 
  The Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu) said 
the proposal also calls on the government to increase stockpiles 
of rice, including imported rice, to about two million tons. 
  The union also urged the government to review its policy of 
rice production cutbacks under which farmers are imposed a 
uniform quota for acreage reduction. 
  The proposal is in line with the government policy of 
deregulation to cope with a partial opening of Japan's rice 
market, union officials said. 
  The officials said the union wants the government to adopt a 
pricing system aimed at promoting consumption of domestically 
produced rice. 
  Rice held in government stock should be used not only for 
table use but also for animal feeds and foreign aid, the 
officials said. 
  They said the government should seek the people's 
understanding for an extra cost of about 219.3 billion yen for 
the rice stockpiles. 
  The proposal will be examined further before it is submitted 
to the government on June 8, when the union will come up with 
its demand for prices of newly reaped rice this year, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- The new farm minister 
Thursday [28 April] called for a cut in the price of Japanese 
rice. 
  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Mutsuki Kato 
made the call in his first news conference after assuming his 
new post earlier in the day. 
  He said that in determining the government's purchase price 
of rice, harvested in 1994, the difference between domestic and 
overseas prices should be narrowed.

  [Text] A close aide of Burmese drug warlord Khun Sa 
yesterday denied that the opium kingpin wants his Shan state to 
become part of the Thai kingdom. 
  Khernsai Jaiyene said although Khun Sa respects the Thai 
monarch highly and wants closer ties with Bangkok, he wants Shan 
to remain "independent". 
  He said Khun Sa could have been misquoted. 
  "We respect His Majesty the King and, once Shan state gains 
independence, we would like to invite the Thais to trade with 
us," Khun Sa said during a recent press interview. "All our rich 
natural resources can be sold to Thailand as raw material and 
Thailand will benefit immensely from it." 
  Khun Sa said he would like Shan state to have a close 
economic relationship with Thailand, like that of countries in 
the European Community.

  [Excerpt] A KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT correspondent filed a 
report on his recent visit to Shan State, the territory under 
control of Khun Sa, a world-renowned heroin producer. He said 
he could hear the sounds of gunfire from the fighting between 
the Burmese and ethnic minority forces along the Thai-Burmese 
border in Mae Hong Son Province. He also reported that many 
young men aged between 10 and 15 are receiving military 
training. Boys are drafted into the Shan Army when they reach 
15 years of age. 
  From Saengchai Saengchu, the Khan Sa group's assistant 
coordinator for civilian affairs, he learned that in early 1994 
the Burmese Government spent $1 billion to buy 14 Mirage 
aircraft from China. The Chinese Mirage is a copy of the 
Russian version. 
  Saengchai said: "We have information that the Burmese 
Government paid 40 percent of the cost of the Mirage in cash. 
The aircraft will be used to suppress antigovernment minority 
groups. The Burmese Government obtained money from signing away 
fishing, gem mining, and logging concessions. The remaining 60 
percent could be paid to China by allowing it to build a highway 
from Mandalay to Rangoon and a large seaport to give China a new 
access to the sea." 
  Saengchai said his information is that not all the planes 
will be used against Khun Sa forces. Most of them will be 
targetted against the Karen rebel group who controls the area 
opposite Thailand's Mae Sariang District and Tak Province. Two 
of the planes have already been shot down by Karen rebels. 
  Shan State leader Khun Sa, however, said he was not 
frightened by Burmese Government's purchase of Chinese planes to 
suppress rebellious minority groups. His forces have 
antiaircraft guns and SAM-7 rockets to deal with these planes. 
His men have also been instructed to build protective shelters. 
  Khun Sa said: "We have hired foreign technicians. We are now 
able to produce RPG's. Although their quality is not that good, 
they will be able to shoot down Burmese planes because the 
planes are an older model and have low capabilities. They also 
have a short flying period because of their small fuel tanks." 
Moreover, Khun Sa said he now has 47,000 soldiers after the 
training of the 27th batch in early 1994. Another batch of 
4,000 have already started the 28th training cycle. Another 
7,000 is expected to be trained in the 29th cycle and another 
8,000 in the 30th cycle. He expects that by the end of this 
year his forces will grow by another 20,000 men. This size will 
be sufficient to fight the Burmese Government soldiers. [passage

  [Excerpts] Senior General Than Shwe, patron of the Union 
Solidarity and Development Association [USDA], chairman of the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council, and commander in chief 
of the Defense Services, addressed the opening ceremony of the 
USDA executives management training course No. 2/94 held at 0900 
today in the Union Hall of the Training Department of the 
Central Public Relations Corps in Hmawbi. [passage omitted on 
attendance] 
  Than Shwe expressed his pleasure at meeting the trainees and 
said that the trainees need to act as full-fledged USDA members. 
He explained in establishing an organization, the structure, 
procedures, rules and regulations, and programs of the 
organization have to be drawn up. He said if these structure 
and procedures only exist on paper and the organization members 
do not understand these procedures and structure, they will not 
be able to successfully implement organization programs. He 
said the training course on objectives, rules and regulations, 
and programs, of the organization is to enable the executive 
members to systematically implement, manage, and organize USDA 
programs. 
  Than Shwe said the central level of the organization would 
not be able to operate extensively at the grassroots level, and 
that the course is to enable regional leaders to extensively 
operate as full-fledged members at the grassroots levels. He 
explained that the training course is being held to enable 
executive members to coordinate work systematically among 
themselves at various levels so that they would not carry out 
programs on their own initiative. He said the course will 
systematically train them in office and organizational work. 
The trainees would also be taught in areas of general 
knowledge, he said. 
  Than Shwe explained that the courses would be conducted by 
cabinet ministers, directors general, and managing directors and 
called on the trainees to study and observe subjects to be 
taught and to ask questions if they do not understand. [passage 
omitted] 
  He said once the course is completed, the trainees are to 
carry out organizational work in their regions and that they 
need to study in order to master their tasks. He explained that 
although the USDA is a social organization, they need to master 
organizational work because if they cannot effectively carry out 
organization work, their organization would fall apart. 
Therefore, he urged the trainees to study the curriculum 
seriously so that they can put it into practice. 
  Than Shwe explained that following the events of 1988, there 
has been a switch from a one-party system to a multiparty one, 
and the economic system has been changed to a market economy. 
He said the USDA is a social organization, which together with 
the Defense Services, will provide guidance to ensure that the 
union, which is formed by all national races, remains stable and 
peaceful. 
  He said the SLORC is currently holding the National 
Convention, which is aimed at developing a firm state 
constitution. He said the new constitution would emerge when 
the time comes and a new nation would then emerge. He added 
that the SLORC is working for national reconciliation. He 
explained that there had been no national solidarity and 
stability and peace in the country since independence. That was 
why armed organizations in the jungle are being invited to 
return to the legal fold. The invitation is being extended not 
because we have difficulties, but because we would like to carry 
out development projects in areas where the armed organizations 
have returned to the legal fold and where national races 
previously had no rights to economic development, health, 
education, and social development. 
  He said there has been considerable success in introduction 
of the market economy and that the rate of economic growth was 
10.9 percent in 1992-93 and 6 percent in 1993-94. He said 
efforts would be made to maintain this growth to improve the 
living standards of everyone, including workers and peasants. He 
said that while we should strive for political stability and 
national unity, we should also work for economic progress. 
  He said there should be harmony at the executive 
organizations at various levels under the leadership of the 
central organization, in striving to successfully implement the 
objectives of the organization. 
  In conclusion, he called on the trainees to seriously study 
the subjects taught in the course. The ceremony ended at 0925.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 3 May (AKP) -- On Sunday, King Norodom 
Sihanouk condemned the attack against a peace march by the Khmer 
Rouge [KR] guerrillas, who killed at least three persons in 
northwestern Cambodia on the previous day. "I express my 
condolences and my grief to (march organizer Superior Bonze) 
Moha Khosananda, the bonzes and laymen, and my compatriots and 
foreign friends who sacrificed themselves for the ideals of 
peace, national reconciliation, nonviolence, and friendship 
through Lord Buddha's peaceful means," the monarch declared in a 
communique. He stated the Khmer Rouge were responsible for these 
"tragic and sad actions." 
  A peace march spokesman, cited by AFP, declared that three 
persons, a bonze, a nun, and a layman, were killed Saturday 
evening with automatic weapons while at least three bonzes were 
wounded by the Khmer Rouge. According to the Battambang police, 
the violence resulted in four dead during this attack, which 
took place near Bavel District. 
  King Sihanouk urged the organizers of the march to cancel 
the 
initiative out of fear that "other incidents" would take place. 
The peace march of some 1,000 persons, led by Buddhist spiritual 
leader and Nobel peace prize nominee Moha Khosanada, left for 
Battambang on 24 April. It planned to go to the Khmer Rouge 
headquarters in Pailin, some 400 km from here, and then go on to 
the Angkor Wat temples. According to march organizers, several 
of the 12 foreigners who took part in the march were kidnapped 
by the Khmer Rouge. 
  King Sihanouk demanded they be freed immediately, but 
information on these alleged kidnappings remained unclear 
Sunday. A British diplomat said there were contradictory 
reports about their fates and that one of the persons believed 
kidnapped was seen safe and sound in Battambang. Serei Kosal, 
deputy Battambang governor, said he had heard that foreigners 
were reported missing and believed kidnapped by the Khmer Rouge, 
but he could not confirm these reports.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 1 (XINHUA) -- The round-table talks 
on Cambodia's national reconciliation scheduled for May 2 have 
been canceled due to disagreement on the meeting site. 
  Khieu Samphan, chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea Party, 
said in a telegraph to King Norodom Sihanouk today that the 
round-table should be held in a neutral place instead of Phnom 
Penh which he said can not guarantee the safety of the party's 
delegation. Khieu Samphan said that the round-table should be 
held in Pyongyang or elsewhere as the King proposed in his April 
24 telegraph. 
  However, King Sihanouk told Khieu Samphan in a telegraph 
yesterday that the co-prime ministers of the Cambodian 
Government agreed that Khieu Samphan and his delegation would 
stay in the palace to ensure their safety, but they were opposed 
to hold the round-table in a foreign country. 
  The round-table meeting was proposed by King Sihanouk on 
April 22, but the two sides failed to agree on a meeting place. 
  According to reports from Khmer Rouge, military 
confrontation 
continues in northwest part of the Cambodia this morning with 
Khmer Rouge capturing several towns.

  [Text] Fighting between Khmer Rouge guerrillas and 
Cambodian government forces across the border from Aranyaprathet 
intensified yesterday. 
  The Khmer Rouge 519 Division under Mit Sau pushed government 
forces from Yeang Dangkum by burning villagers' houses and 
soldiers camps, according to military sources on the border. 
  The government force was later holding its ground under 
protection of artillery rounds fired from Ban Nimit base on 
Route 5. More than 25 shells fell in Thailand around Non Mak Mun 
and injured one Thai soldier. 
  About 200 Khmer refugees had been trying to escape the 
fighting but were moved near checkpoint No. 27 of the 12th 
Ranger Regiment at Ban Nong Chan, a safe area away from the 
border. Another 300 Cambodians were scattered near the border. 
An additional Khmer Rouge force was pressing the government base 
at Ban Sing. 
  A military source in Aranyaprathet said fighting began about 
noon yesterday about six kilometres south of Poipet. The Burapha 
Task Force authorized warning smoke rounds to be fired north of 
the government base after shells fell on Thai soil. 
  A task force source said the Khmer Rouge attack was 
extremely 
cruel with reports of decapitation in order to intimidate 
villagers.

<F P=106> [Statement by National Army of Democratic Kampuchea </F>
spokesman; dated 2 May -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] I. It has been reported that a peace march was 
made to the Bavel region last Saturday and that two or three 
marchers were shot dead. This report hinted at the National 
Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] as being responsible for the 
incident. 
  The NADK spokesman would like to emphasize that the NADK had 
nothing to do with this peace march. In fact: 
  1. The NADK did not know the starting point nor destination 
of this march. 
  2. The situation in the western part of the town of 
Battambang is marked by the fact that the communist Vietnamese, 
their puppets, and their allies' puppets have been launching 
fierce and continuous operations against the national resistance 
forces and people, thus causing inestimable damage and endless 
misery to the villages and people in this region. 
  3. The NADK would like to emphasize that anyone who wants to 
find the culprit in the peace march incident should look at the 
evildoers, that is, the communist Vietnamese, their puppets, and 
their allies and puppets who have kindled the war together and 
are continuing to kindle the flames of war which has burned and 
ruined Cambodia, the Cambodian people, Buddhism, temples, and 
monasteries for 15 years now. By now, half of Cambodia is 
becoming another Kampuchea Kraom. 
  To cite Lord Buddha, all these atheists are the ones who 
have 
committed all kinds of evil deeds, especially killing and 
stealing. The Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian nation and 
people are the victims, victims who have suffered untold misery 
and not been allowed even to protect themselves. They have 
jointly attacked and accused us in an unjust, inhuman, arrogant, 
and brutal manner in line with their evil nature as demons who 
like to suck human blood. 
  4. Questions: Who does not know that the communist 
Vietnamese have installed their puppets to serve as a 
smokescreen for the communist Vietnamese to continue their 
aggression and occupation of Cambodia? Who does not know that 
the allies have integrated their puppets with the communist 
Vietnamese puppets since July 1993 in order to continue fueling 
the Vietnamese war to kill the nation, people, and resistance 
forces? In Lord Buddha's moral precept, who has done all these 
evil deeds? In the way of the world, who have been the 
aggressors against the Cambodian nation and people for the past 
15 years? 
  From these few questions, people can clearly see without any 
delusion what is white and what is black. 
  [Signed] NADK spokesman 
  [Dated] 2 May 1994

<F P=106> [Commentary by Seiha: "The Royal Government Must Review Its </F>
Economic Policy"] 
  [Text] Cambodia's economy is deteriorating to an alarming 
extent. Everyone knows that Cambodia needs a huge sum of money 
for national rehabilitation and reconstruction, and that its 
main income comes from customs duties and taxes. Declining 
economic activity -- with a huge plunge in imports and exports 
-- has caused the country's income to drop by about 50 percent. 
This is the official figure announced by Economy and Finance 
Minister Sam Rangsi. This decline will certainly upset the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance's plan to seek 361 billion riels 
in income for the current fiscal year. 
  In addition to the decline in export-import activity, 
foreign 
investment in general has not grown since it was permitted by 
the Royal Government. Although there has been no official 
announcement regarding foreign investment statistics, the facts 
show various companies that previously invested in Cambodia have 
withdrawn part of their funds and have turned to investment in 
Vietnam. Meanwhile, other companies that planned to invest in 
Cambodia have maintained a wait-and-see attitude. 
  In addition to the political situation in the country, Mr. 
Sam Rangsi admitted that Vietnam's opening up to free import 
marketing and Thailand's reduction of its import taxes have also 
caused Cambodian exports to drop. Moreover, traders feel bad 
about a number of new principles recently announced by the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance. Thus, there is sufficient 
reason to say that Vietnam's opening up has caused the decline 
in investment in Cambodia. 
  Another heavy burden for the Royal Government is the recent 
verbal attacks and conflicts along the Cambodian-Thai border, 
which have caused the closure of the border at Poipet. This 
closure has badly affected the Cambodian economy and added a 
heavy burden to the daily livelihoods of the Cambodian people. 
  Moreover, although Sam Rangsi did not mention the fourth 
cause of the decline in state income, everyone well knows about 
it; that is, corruption among those who rule the state and 
control the national economy. 
  How will the government solve the present situation? It is 
true that the political situation has impacted on Cambodia's 
economic situation. But some have criticized Cambodia for 
having a serious crisis in state control over economic affairs. 
This requires an urgent remedy. Efforts should also be made to 
find a control mechanism that can stimulate economic activities. 
  The time has come for the Royal Government to take a look at 
itself in a new mirror to see whether or not its economic policy 
has caused the decline of the national economy. 
  It is believed that this economic crisis -- if not remedied 
in time -- will be more dangerous than the downfall on the 
Pailin battlefield.

<F P=106> [By Sheila A. Samonte] </F>
  [Text] The country's debt planners may be praying for more 
rain. 
  Partly because the financial system is still relatively 
awash 
with dollars, a senior Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] official 
said monetary authorities are confident government will be able 
to service its $1.1 billion maturing obligations with the Paris 
Club creditors sans any restructuring agreement. 
  "Even if these debts are not restructured, since we have 
more 
dollars ... we need not use up our gross international reserves 
(GIR)," the official yesterday told BUSINESS WORLD. 
  Earlier, fiscal and monetary officials said the country may 
no longer be able to fully reschedule its maturing Paris Club 
debts in the next three years with the external financing gap 
programmed to dwindle from $500 million this year. 
  The country serviced about $750 million in maturing 
obligations last year. Another $234 million was paid during the 
first quarter, while $560 million is scheduled in the second 
quarter. 
  A three-year extended fund facility (EFF) from the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF), seen to be approved this 
June, is expected to enable the country to negotiate for a fifth 
rescheduling agreement for its $1.1 billion maturing obligations 
with the Paris Club. 
  Ironically, the high liquidity of the system -- mainly 
brought about by the continuous deluge of from overseas contract 
workers funds [as published] -- is testing the limits on the 
country's healthy GIR position, which stood at about $6.3 
billion as of mid- April. 
  Bank treasury officials were surprised when the Bangko 
Sentral suddenly shifted gears and slowed down on its dollar 
buying tack the other day after weeks of heavy buying. From a 
total volume of dollar purchases of $1.06 billion as of 
mid-April, the Bangko Sentral slowed down its support of the 
peso with its current total volume now standing at about $1.2 
billion, or a difference of about $141 million within the almost 
two-week period. 
  The peso gained 78 centavos to the dollar the other day, to 
close at P27.457 [Philippine pesos] to the dollar from the 
previous day's P27.535. 
  As of about 2:30 PM, a trader said the last done deal stood 
at P27.23. "With Bangko Sentral intervention, it may close at 
P27.35," he predicted. 
  The Bangko Sentral has lately been buying only between $2 
million and $3 million on the average per bank, the Bangko 
Sentral official admitted. 
  He, however, said the Bangko Sentral is "still following 
market (movements)." A primary reason for the heavy buying tack 
it earlier adopted may be inflation, which monetary authorities 
are closely watching out for because of the system's excess 
liquidity situation. 
  "It's not that we're not buying much, but there really is 
low 
corporate demand due to last quarter's uncertainty in the 
market." Investors overbought dollars anticipating that the 
uptick in the peso exchange value would be carried over in the 
first quarter of the year, the source said. 
  The interbank call loan rate (IBCLR) again surged, closing 
at 
a high of 68 percent (value dated Wednesday) or about 12 
percentage points short of the record-high rate registered 
end-September last year when the peso plummeted at a record-low 
against the dollar. The average IBCLR was at 45.5625 percent, 
5.875 percent higher than the previous day's average of 39.6875 
percent. 
  "It's a very unusual situation," a treasury official 
described. 
  The foreign exchange rate is seen to taper off to "normal" 
level within two months' time, in anticipation of huge dollar 
outflows as banks negotiate for more import demands. The Bangko 
Sentral official said there has been a significant uptick in the 
number of 60-day letters of credit being opened recently. 
  Still, at this point, treasury officials held mixed views on 
where the upsurge in dollars come from.

  [Text] The Philippines has launched a campaign to increase 
its exports to Japan. 
  Under this action plan, the country's exports are projected 
to increase from $1.8 billion in 1993 to $1.90 billion in 1994; 
$1.99 billion in 1995; $2.19 billion in 1996; $2.42 billion in 
1997 and $2.66 billion in 1998. 
  To achieve these objectives, the Export Development Council 
(EDC) has adopted the following strategies: 
-- Establish a priority Japan program. 
  -- Promote an effective marketing of the Philippines, its 
products, services and investment opportunities. 
  -- Enhance the Philippine investment environment to take 
advantage of the globalization of Japanese industries. 
  -- Strengthen supply capacities through technology 
transfer and increase overall production and efficiency with 
foreign capital. 
  It was noted that during the past few years the trade 
balance 
between the two countries had always been in favor of Japan. 
  Statistics show that in 1988 Philippine exports to Japan 
amounted to $1.420 million against imports of $1.421 million; 
1989, $1.591 million against $2.043 million; 1990, $1.621 
million against $2.258 million; 1991, $1.771 million against 
$2.372 million; 1992, $1.745 million against $3.086 million and 
1993, $1.810 million against $4.00 million. 
  The top Philippine exports were shrimps and prawns, fresh 
bananas, copper concentrates, ignition wiring sets, electrical 
and electronic machineries. 
  The top Philippine imports were consigned electronic parts, 
car components, industrial circuit parts and microassemblies, 
structures of iron and steel and truck components. 
  Meanwhile, it was also revealed that the Philippines also 
plans to increase its exports to the Greater China market by 50 
percent to $1.9 billion this year. 
  This was reported by Salome Rebosura, leader of the Greater 
China Market Group, during a meeting of the Export Development 
Council (EDC). 
  Greater China is composed of mainland China, Hong Kong and 
China's breakaway island province of Taiwan. 
  Export leaders acknowledged the potentials of Greater China 
to raise the country's export receipts. The nation has set a 15 
percent annual growth target for exports. 
  To achieve the targets of the industry, Rebosura cited the 
following short-term strategies: 
-- Focus marketing strategy on Southern China. 
  -- Establish commercial and consulate offices in Guangdong 
or Fujian. 
  -- Carry out market researches on Greater China initially 
on Southern China. 
  -- Conduct an aggressive marketing and promotional program. 
  -- Negotiate and implement cooperation development 
projects. 
  -- Explore "outward processing trade" and other joint 
venture arrangements. 
She also listed the following long-term strategies: 
  -- Study air and tourism linkages. 
  -- Cultivate long-term relationship and commitment. 
  -- Carry out extensive market research. 
  -- Sustain an aggressive marketing and promotional program. 
  -- Institutionalize networking.

<F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>
  [Text] Armed Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile 
yesterday declared government's counterinsurgency campaign a 
success based on recorded accomplishments in the first four 
months of 1994. 
  At the same time, Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Vice 
Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Alfredo Filler said all existing rebel 
groups in the country are not capable of causing instability. 
  Mr. Enrile said the total number of armed regulars of all 
threat groups dropped 30 percent last year through the 
military's counterinsurgency campaign plan "Lambat Bitag 
[Dragnet Snare]." 
  The AFP also recorded a 13 percent decline in the total 
number of high-powered firearms in the hands of rebels and a 52 
percent slide in the total number of insurgency-affected 
barangays [villages]. 
  Recently, National Police Commission Chairman Rafael Alunan 
declared strategic victory over Muslim guerrillas, communist 
rebels, and other breakaway groups, saying their strengths have 
been reduced considerably through the combined efforts of the 
military and police. 
  Likewise, Gen. Enrile said armed groups such as the New 
People's Army, Abu Sayyaf, Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and 
Alex Boncayao Brigade have been crippled by counterinsurgency 
efforts. 
  However, the recently installed armed forces chief warned 
against "prematurely sweeping the insurgency threat under the 
rug" because "political consolidations are still going on." 
  Even as the first quarter of this year has shown 
considerable 
rewards for government, Mr. Enrile said, "The decline in the 
number of major engagements only means that they have shifted 
into small unit operations. But they are still there." 
  Mr. Filler also said threats from both the leftist and 
rightist groups have been marginalized. He stressed that unlike 
before, rightist groups like the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang 
Makabansa [Revolutionary Nationalist Alliance]-Soldiers of the 
Filipino People-Young Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU) are no longer 
considered threats to national security. 
  He belittled the capability of the said groups, saying they 
are not capable of grabbing power from the present 
administration based on the reported decrease in their manpower 
and assets. 
  As communist factions are busy consolidating forces, Mr. 
Enrile said, the country's armed forces will concentrate on 
national economic development as well as the protection and 
conservation of the environment and the remaining natural 
resources. 
  He also revealed plans to engage in massive cooperative 
projects nationwide. 
  According to Army Chief Maj. Gen Romulo Yap, government is a 
month ahead of its counterinsurgency campaign scheduled before 
the year. [sentence as published]

  [Text] All former rebels subject to arrest by the 
underground movement for alleged crimes must surrender to the 
New People's Army (NPA) rather than fight it out, the National 
Democratic Front (NDF) said yesterday. 
  In a statement, NDF chairman Manuel Romero said that arrest 
warrants will be served by guerrilla units on all those 
currently facing criminal charges before people's courts. 
  Romero stressed that the NDF, a coalition of at least 12 big 
organizations fighting the Ramos administration, has a judicial 
system that upholds "the right of suspects to due process." 
  "Upon the issuance of the warrant of arrest by the people's 
court, a criminal suspect like (Ricardo) Reyes can submit 
himself willingly and peacefully to the NPA arresting unit or he 
can voluntarily surrender himself to the revolutionary 
authorities," Romero said. 
  Reyes has been accused by the NDF of implementing Kampanyang 
Ahos [Garlic Campaign], a campaign which resulted in the torture 
and murder of "hundreds of hundreds of Communist Party of the 
Philippines members, NPA fighters, NDF allies and mass activists 
without due process." The campaign was mounted in 1985-1986 to 
weed out alleged deep penetration agents (DPA) within the 
underground movement. 
  Subsequent events indicated that many of those executed on 
suspicion of being DPAs could have been innocent. 
  With a rectification movement taking place within the rebel 
movement, leaders allegedly behind such incidents as Kampanyang 
Ahos are now being called to account for their deeds. 
  Warning them against resisting arrest by NPA unit, Romero 
said the NPA has been authorized to "give battle when necessary 
to defend itself or prevent the suspect from resisting arrest." 
  The leaders accused of authorizing the campaign have been 
criticized for refusing to follow orders to cease their campaign 
to divide the NDF and discredit the current leadership of both 
the CPP and the NPA. 
  Charges against them were filed by the families of victims 
and those whom they have attacked openly for more than two years 
after the rectification campaign was launched by the CPP in late 
1992. 
  One of the anti-Sison leaders has warned that if the 
"people's court" issues a death sentence, they will retaliate by 
sending an assassin to eliminate Sison.

  [Text] Police authorities in the Autonomous Region in 
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) have recommended to higher police 
headquarters the launching of an all out offensive against the 
extremists Abu Sayyaf group, Mindanao's most dreaded terrorist 
band. The recommendation was issued by ARMM Police regional 
director chief Supt. Magingin Magomnang after receiving reports 
Wednesday from Sulu Police provincial director Supt. Aukasa 
Handa. 
  Magomnang called a command conference Wednesday at Camp S.K. 
Pendatun in Parang, Maguindanao. It was his first meeting with 
his subordinates this year. 
  Both Magomnang and Handa said that the number of the 
fundamentalist group is increasing and a massive police action 
should be taken against them before they can harm people with 
their terroristic activities. 
  "I am considering Abu Sayyaf group as a threat," Handa told 
reporters. "I am recommending to higher headquarters that 
police action should be taken against this group." 
  The Abu Sayyaf, a fundamentalist group that originated in 
Basilan province, is composed of 80 to 100 fully armed members. 
  Denying the group had just received arms shipment from 
nearby 
countries, Handa said the Abu Sayyaf, led by Abdulradjak 
Janjalani, is armed with several 90 recoilless rifles, B-57, 
mortars, M-60 and M-50 machineguns and assorted high powered 
firearms. The group was tagged by military and police 
authorities as responsible in several criminal activities such 
as kidnapping and bombings in Mindanao. It was also believed to 
be responsible in the Davao Cathedral bombing last December 26 
which killed six church-goers and wounded 150 others. 
  Authorities also identified the extremist group as 
responsible in the kidnapping of language researcher Charles 
Walton, shipyard owner Ricardo Tong of Zamboanga City, 
missionary priest Bernardo Blanco, Spanish nuns in Sulu and 
several businessmen in the Zamboanga archipelago. 
  "The Abu Sayyaf is really a threat in the area, particularly 
in Sulu, but we have some precautionary measures that can take 
care of this group," Magomnang said in a press conference. He 
said he will tak to PNP chief Dir. General Umberto Rodriguez and 
Chief of Staff Gen Lisandro Abadia for a joint police and 
military action against Abu Sayyaf. 
  Magomnang also reported that he already had a talk with 
several Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) commanders in Sulu 
to cooperate with the police in pursuing the fundamentalist 
group. 
  Handa stressed that the Abu Sayyaf is not yet capable of 
destabilizing Mindanao. 
  Abadia, during his Mindanao visit last month, said Abu 
Sayyaf 
cannot destabilize the region but admitted that they can create 
trouble and terrorize people. 
  Calling the extremists as narrow-minded and uneducated 
fundamentalist, Abadia said "dahil uneducated, madali lang 
mahilang propaganda [because they are uneducated, they are 
easily drawn in by propaganda.]" 
  He described the group as an international phenomenon which 
is being imitated by Filipinos. 
  Fundamentalism, according to the AFP chief, is good and it 
can be found in highly urbanized cities of the world like in 
Europe, Algeria and the Middle East. But he added that there 
are groups claiming to be fundamentalists but in reality they 
are terrorists. 
  When asked why the military appeared unable to neutralize 
Abu 
Sayyaf, Abadia remarked by saying that "even the mightiest of 
the countries in the world is seemingly helpless." 
  Extremists were tagged as behind the New York bombing 
recently which killed several people and caused damaged to 
properties. 
  Admitting terrorism is difficult to address, Abadia vowed to 
neutralize the group in due time. 
  Magomnang said the police has already identified the base of 
Abu Sayyaf in Sulu and will strike anytime when the "go signal" 
is issued. Aside from Basilan, Handa said the Abu Sayyaf is 
concentrated in Patikul, Sulu.

<F P=106> [By Cristina D. C. Pastor] </F>
  [Text] The Senate yesterday unanimously ratified a bill 
increasing stocks transaction taxes on listed shares and 
imposing taxes on initial public offerings (IPOs). 
  The measure, which is expected to generate incremental 
revenue of P800 million [Philippine pesos], is one of several 
revenue-enhancement measures recommended by the executive for 
legislation. 
  Senate bill 1127 is entitled "An act imposing a tax on sale, 
barter or exchange of shares of stocks listed and traded through 
the local stock exchanges or through IPOs, amending for the 
purpose the National Internal Revenue Code." 
  The bill seeks to impose tax rates equivalent to 3/8th of 1 
percent on listed and transacted stocks on the first year, and 
1/2 of 1 percent on the second and succeeding years. 
  IPOs of closed corporations going public will be taxed as 
follows: 
-- 4 percent of gross sales for corporations offering shares 
below 33 1/3 percent; 
  -- 2 percent of gross sales for corporations offering 
shares from 33 1/3 percent to below 50 percent; 
  -- 1 percent of gross sales for corporations offering 
shares of more than 50 percent. 
  Right now, listed stocks are taxed at 1/4 of 1 percent. 
  Senator Ernesto Herrera, chairman of the ways and means 
committee, said the idea behind the provision on closed 
corporations is to encourage such firms to go public. "The more 
shares you offer, the lower your taxes," he told reporters. 
  He said this provision amends an earlier provision seeking 
to 
impose a uniform 2 percent on IPOs. 
  The bill also redefines a "100 percent closed corporation," 
a 
term currently used to refer to a company owned by less than 
five persons. The measure defines a closed corporation as a 
company held by less than 20 persons. 
  "The tax will be based on gross selling price ... and will 
be 
paid by the issuing corporation," said a provision of the bill. 
  Meanwhile, the Senate failed yesterday to ratify the bill 
expanding the value-added tax (VAT), and has set a Monday 
deadline for its ratification. 
  Senate President Edgardo Angara said some senators asked for 
more time to go over the compromise bill. 
  He said final approval of the bill by both chambers should 
not be tied to the ongoing negotiations between the country's 
economic managers and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
  "This is independent of the IMF," he said of the pending 
ratification. "This is for our own sake. The VAT will simplify 
the tax administration." 
  At the same time, he said IMF approval of the country's 
three- year economic program is also important if government 
wants to "unlock" official development assistance, and 
restructure about $1 billion in Paris Club loans. 
  The senator said what could be problematic is not so much 
the 
approval of the bill but enforcement of the VAT law. He spoke 
of a big businessman with VAT liabilities amounting to P1 
billion. 
  "We have to do something in terms of the collection effort," 
he said. 
  Mr. Herrera said the VAT bill itself has the answer to the 
potential collection problem. The bill appropriates 5 percent 
of the incremental revenue from VAT collection to the budget of 
the Bureau of Internal Revenue [BIR]. 
  "So the BIR cannot come to us and say they have problems 
with 
personnel and facilities. We are giving 5 percent of the 
incremental revenue to them," he said.

  [Text] Speaking to a THAN SETTHAKIT correspondent about the 
recent Thai-U.S. negotiations on an aviation agreement, Warawut 
Bunyatket, director of the International Affairs and the 
Aviation Industry Division of Thai Airways International [THAI], 
said that THAI, for the time being, is not interested in 
increasing the number of its regular flights or opening new 
flights to the United States because it is rather difficult to 
make any profit from flying to that country due to strong 
competition and price cutting campaigns among the U.S. airlines. 
It is unlikely that THAI will make any change in its operation 
even if the new agreement allows it to fly up to 38 flights per 
week to the United States. 
  He said: "In any event, what we want is equality in carrying 
passengers from third countries. The Thai side proposed a 
limitation on the number of passengers from third countries for 
each flight at 45 percent. We do not know if the U.S. side will 
accept it or not." 
  Worawut went on to say that THAI is now engaging in a "code 
sharing" [preceding two words in English] operation through 
aircraft and ticket sharing with United Airlines as a means of 
maintaining its market share in the region pending the 
conclusion of an agreement with the United States that will 
incorporate destinations in the United States to which THAI can 
fly. 
  Meanwhile, Mahidon Chantharangsuk, permanent secretary of 
the 
Communications Ministry and head of the Thai delegation at the 
next round of the aviation talks with the United States to be 
held in Bangkok in June, said the negotiations will cover the 
details of issues concerned, especially the sharing percentage 
[as published], the flight numbers, and new destinations in the 
United States requested by THAI. 
  During the first round of the negotiations, the Thai side 
made four major proposals. First, the U.S. airlines operate 38 
flights per week to Thailand -- 31 for passengers and 7 for 
cargo. Presently, three U.S. airlines operate 28 flights per 
week to Thailand while Thai has only four flights per week to 
the United States. Second, the U.S. airlines are required to 
carry at least 55 percent passengers from Thailand on each 
flight before it is allowed to carry passengers from third 
countries. 
  Third, the U.S. airlines are required to carry up to 70 
percent tourists on each flight on which they intend to seek 
permission to fly to a new destination in Thailand. Fourth, the 
total number of flights between the two countries is equally 
divided for airlines of the two countries. 
  On the other hand, the U.S. side made two proposals. First, 
the Thai side should stop freezing the number of seats of each 
U.S. flight at only 290. Second, the procedure for the 
collection of the value-added tax should be revised. 
  The permanent secretary of the communications minister said 
that the conclusion of an aviation agreement will further expand 
the aviation services between the two countries. He will 
encourage THAI to increase its regular flights to the United 
States. THAI is capable of making up to 11 flights per week to 
the United States.

  [Text] Police said yesterday they plan to arrest a former 
drug adviser to ex-U.S. President Jimmy Carter who was 
photographed in Burma wearing the uniform of opium warlord Khun 
Sa's hilltribe army. 
  Lt-Colonel Supachai Sirisap, deputy head of the Foreign 
Affairs Division of the Royal Thai Police said: 
  "It is our intention to arrest him when we see him. He 
appears to have crossed the Burmese border illegally from 
Thailand." 
  The statement came after a spokesman for the United States 
embassy said that Peter Bourne, former adviser on narcotics to 
the Carter administration, was indeed the man photographed and 
identified in the Bangkok Post on Sunday as "Peter Bond". 
  A United States embassy spokesman said: 
  "He is not in Burma on any official business of the United 
States Government." 
  "As far as we are concerned Khun Sa is the single biggest 
heroin dealer in Burma and we have warrants out for his arrest," 
the U.S. embassy spokesman said. 
  Khun Sa has offered to sell the United States his annual 
opium crop numerous times in the past as part of his own plan to 
help eradicate the world of heroin. 
  The United States has refused to deal with him despite 
previous visits by Congressman Lester Wolf. 
  Bourne was relieved of his job as presidential adviser on 
narcotics after allegedly abusing his position. 
  Peter Bourne, aged 60, however was rumoured to have 
re-entered Thailand and departed on a U.S.-bound flight on 
Sunday night.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday pointed 
to the possibility of France and Indonesia being called to help 
settle the Cambodian problem. 
  King Norodom Sihanouk was proceeding on the issue, Squadron 
Leader Prasong said, confirming support for a so-called 
round-table among Cambodians. 
  But he said "there is a mechanism for solving the Cambodian 
problem and the most significant one is the co-chairmanship of 
Indonesia and France". 
  The situation may warrant resort to this "old mechanism". 
  The minister made the remark shortly before it was made 
known 
that peace talks due to begin in Phnom Penh yesterday and 
continue to May 7 had been suspended. 
  The Khmer Rouge has cited security concerns for refusing to 
go to Phnom Penh for talks. 
  King Sihanouk reportedly has suggested Paris, Jakarta and 
Pyongyang as possible alternative venues for the round table. 
  Thai officials said the 1991 Paris peace agreements provided 
for signatories to call on the assistance of the cochairmen of 
the Paris conference on Cambodia in the event of a violation or 
threat of violation. 
  The Khmer Rouge signed the peace agreement but refused to 
disarm, and fighting has escalated in northwestern Cambodia over 
the past week. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong urged a negotiated settlement. 
  "If the round table can be held, the situation will 
improve," 
he said. 
  "I don't think the Cambodian problems can be solved through 
military means but rather by political means, which may take 
some time. We need to be patient." 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong made the comments shortly after talks with 
United States Deputy Joint Chief-of-Staff Admiral William Owens. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong said he asked the U.S. to refrain from 
giving 
support to any one Cambodian faction as this would prolong the 
conflict. 
  He also reaffirmed that Thailand upheld the policy of 
non-interference in Cambodian affairs, and did not support the 
Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] The king has assigned the foreign minister to act 
as his representative at the inauguration ceremony of the new 
president of the Republic of South Africa. 
  In response to an invitation from the president of the 
Supreme Court of South Africa, (N.N. Corbeck), that the king 
send his representative to attend the inauguration ceremony of 
the new South African president scheduled to be held in Pretoria 
on 10 May, his majesty the king has graciously appointed Foreign 
Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri and a delegation from 
the Thai Government to represent him at the ceremony. The 
delegation, led by the foreign minister, is scheduled to be in 
South Africa 8-10 May for the ceremony. 
  The presence of the Thai delegation at the ceremony will 
promote the strengthening of relations between Thailand and 
South Africa. Thailand sent a delegation to observe the first 
free election in South Africa on 26-28 April, during which a 
large number of people cast their ballots. Although 
vote-counting is still under way, it is believed the ANC party 
will win a majority of votes and that Nelson Mandela of the ANC 
will be elected the country's new leader, replacing President 
F.W. De Klerk.

  [Excerpts] Crimes involving the use of firearms and 
explosives could be curbed by amending the law to introduce 
stiffer penalties for illegal possession and use of war weapons, 
Army Commander-in-Chief Wimon Wongwanit suggested yesterday. 
  Gen. Wimon said most military-type weapons used by criminals 
were not obtained from armed forces barracks but from Cambodia 
and Burma where there was still guerrilla warfare. 
  "The Ordnance Corps has stringent regulations controlling 
military supplies," Wimon said. "The law governing war weapons 
should be amended to allow for more severe punishment of 
offenders." 
  He said the military had done its utmost to stop the influx 
of war weaponry from neighbouring countries. 
  Wimon did not believe an explosion at a Phuket hotel 
yesterday was politically motivated, nor was it an act of 
terrorism. But the army chief did not say how he arrived at 
that conclusion. [passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he believed one of the 
most 
effective ways of dealing with the arms smuggling problem was 
for law enforcement officials to arrest major dealers in the 
illegal business and at the same time stem the flow of weapons 
from border countries. The prime minister also said lax control 
of weapons belonging to the armed forces contributed to the 
spread of war weapons. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said the government 
had already instructed law officers to crack down on war weapons 
and stem the influx of military supplies into the country as a 
priority. 
  Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina said yesterday he had 
been told by an anonymous caller that there would be an 
explosion in Phuket tomorrow, when Den is scheduled to open a 
seminar attended by senior police officers from Asean countries. 
  "After receiving the phone call I notified the Phuket police 
chief. I was told by him that strict security is already in 
place. And that a bomb had exploded (yesterday), that's 
strange," Den said. 
  He disagreed with Wimon that harsher penalties for illegal 
use and possession of war weapons would help stem violent crime. 
Den said existing laws already provided for stiff penalties. 
The real problem was that the law was not efficiently and 
consistently enforced. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said efforts to 
suppress the influx of military-type weapons had not been 
successful because the majority of people still did not realize 
the seriousness of the problem. Many people in rural areas 
possessed illegal or unregistered firearms and explosives, 
purportedly to protect themselves.

  [Text] The Bank of Thailand has reported that border trade 
between Thailand and the Lao People's Democratic Republic in the 
first quarter of 1994 recorded a sharp and continuing increase 
when compared with the same period the previous year, with a 
combined total trade value of 1,907.3 million baht, in which 
Thailand enjoyed a 790.1 million baht trade surplus. 
  Thai exports to Laos from January to March this year totaled 
1,348.7 million baht in value, representing a 50 percent 
increase over the 895.7 million baht recorded during the same 
period last year. Of the Thai exports, 33.6 percent were 
consumer products, including automobiles, motorcycles, 
electrical appliances, shoes, and dairy products. Other goods 
exported included construction materials and machinery. 
  During the same period Thailand imported 558.6 million baht 
worth of goods from Laos, an increase of 65.9 percent over last 
year. Of the imports from Laos, 85.4 percent was processed 
wood. Timber imports from Laos increased significantly this 
year due to the improved export quotas set by the Lao Government 
and the timber extracted before the beginning of the 
construction project of the Nam Theun Dam in Khammouane 
Province, which was imported through the border checkpoint of 
Nakhon Phanom Province.

  [Text] Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday 
described the recent spate of bombings as a plot to bring down 
the Chuan Likphai Government. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan has made similar 
comments in recent days. 
  Gen Chavalit said the bombing of the Karon Royal Wing Hotel 
in Phuket late Friday night was not politically motivated. 
  It was the result of a business conflict, while the blast at 
Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station a week earlier was the work 
of a jealous woman. 
  He said the authorities had to be careful because there 
would 
be attempts to mislead them. 
  The minister said opinions were divided over the crackdown 
on 
war weapons. 
  Some thought this could be done with even tougher penalties 
while others believe the crackdown would be unjust if it is not 
enforced equally in all cases. "Some people don't want to see 
the death penalty for this crime. We still can't move to amend 
the law " he said. 
  Chart Thai Party leader Pol Gen Praman Adireksan said it was 
the Government's duty to apprehend those behind the bombings. 
  "I was a victim of a bomb attack at my house several years 
ago and to this day no one has been arrested," he said. 
  Pol Gen Praman rejected the claims by Mr Banyat and Deputy 
Commerce Minister Churin Laksanavisit that the bomb attacks were 
an attempt to bring down the Government, and most people would 
interpret this to mean the Opposition was responsible. 
  He asked how the Opposition could stage the attacks since it 
had no MPs in the South. 
  "Those in Government always think there are people out to 
get 
them. 
  "Ousting the Government through illegal means it is an act 
of 
rebellion. Even if you only think it, it's rebellion," he said. 
  Some government MPs claim an opposition party is financing 
sabotage in the South with the cooperation of those loyal to the 
now defunct National Peace-keeping Council. 
  Pol Gen Praman said the Opposition could only file 
interpellations or open a debate on the issue. 
  He made three observations: 
  That the South is rich in natural resources, both on land 
and 
at sea, that the bombings occur only in that region, and why are 
government MPs in the South not making more noise about the 
problem as it is harming their constituencies. 
  He also said it depended on each person's view if calls to 
replace Gen Chavalit as Interior Minister would solve the 
problem. As a former interior minister, he said, he did not know 
what to say about why the Government was unable to apprehend 
anyone in connection with the burning of 33 schools in the South 
last year. 
  There has also been about 13 bombings with only one person 
arrested in connection with the Nakhon Si Thammarat railway 
station incident. 
  "Why is that so?" asked the Opposition leader. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said all government MPs in the 
South were very concerned about what has been happening but they 
had not been "raising hell" because there was no clear 
information. 
  He said he did not have details to be able to say the 
bombings were aimed at bringing down his Government. 
  "There is not enough evidence to arrest anyone. It's 
difficult," he said.

  [Text] According to the Public Relations Department 
correspondent, Phuket Governor Suchit Nimitkun gave a news 
conference about the bombing yesterday at 2130 in a bathroom at 
the Karon Royal Wing Hotel, Tambon Karon, Phuket Province. The 
incident took place during a party of nationwide Singha Beer 
distributors and their families totaling about 800 people. 
  The governor and the officials concerned inspected the site 
of the incident. The governor said initial police inspection 
revealed that the explosive was C-4 and was aimed only at 
generating noise to frighten the party participants. Two people 
were slightly injured in the legs. The party continued after 
the incident. It was learned that the party organizers might 
have known in advance about a possible disruption plan and had 
asked for police protection. 
  The governor said the incident is not likely to be 
politically motivated. Property and lives were not targetted, 
and it was merely an attempt to intimidate the party goers. 
However, the overall image of Phuket could be affected since 
the province will host several international conferences -- the 
ASEAN police chiefs conference during 1-5 May and the municipal 
league conference during 9-13 May. In any event, the provincial 
administration has taken precautionary measures for these 
events. The people need not worry.

  [Excerpt] Ta Phraya, Sa Kaeo -- More than 25 stray 
artillery shells landed on Thai soil yesterday during heavy 
fighting in Cambodia between government forces and Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas. 
  The latest round of fighting is centred about two kilometres 
from the Thai border opposite Ta Phraya District. 
  A few shells fired by 122 mm artillery pieces landed near 
border checkpoint No 26 at Ban Non Mak Mun in Ta Phraya District 
but caused no casualties. 
  The checkpoint is manned by about 150 rangers of the 12th 
Ranger Regiment and Ta Phraya Task Force. 
  At 10 a.m. about 200 Khmer Rouge soldiers of the 519th 
Division under Mit Sau launched an attack on Ban Yaeng Dangkum, 
a government position, which was protected by about 300 
government soldiers under Gen Lai Veera. 
  The stronghold was overrun by Khmer Rouge shortly 
afterwards. 
  Thai military sources said 12 Cambodian government soldiers 
were killed and many others wounded. 
  The Khmer Rouge soldiers set fire to the weapons and supply 
dumps at Ban Yeang Dangkum. Billowing columns of thick black 
smoke were clearly seen from the Thai border at checkpoint No 26. 
  The sound of gunfire could also be clearly heard around the 
position, indicating heavy fighting in the area. 
  Cambodian government gunners at Ban Nimit artillery base at 
kilometre 12 on Route 5 opened fire in support of their ground 
troops at about 1 p.m. 
  More than 25 rounds landed on the Thai side of the border 
but 
caused no casualties or damage to property. 
  A Thai L-19 reconnaissance aircraft and a helicopter of the 
Burapha Force flew over the border to observe the fighting but 
did not fire any warning shots. [passage omitted citing AP on 
separate Cambodian developments]

<F P=106> [By Shamsul Akmar] </F>
  [Excerpt] Kota Baru, Fri. -- The PAS [Pan Malaysia Islamic 
Party]-led Kelantan Government will award a contract for its 
water supply project to a British company despite the Federal 
Government's decision not to give new contracts to British 
firms. Menteri Besar [Chief Minister] Nik Abdul Aziz Nik Mat 
said today the State Exco [executive council] met last week and 
decided to hire Thames Water for the project. 
  The ban on the award of government contracts for British 
firms was imposed on February 25 following unsubstantiated 
reports by the British media of alleged corruption on the part 
of Malaysian political leaders in deals involving British firms. 
The Cabinet had made it clear that the ban included all Federal 
and State Government contracts. 
  All State Governments, except for the Pas-led Kelantan State 
Government and the then PBS [Sabah United Party] Sabah State 
Government, had supported the move. The decision also received 
overwhelming support from various quarters in Malaysia, 
including politicians, trade unions, non-governmental 
organisations and individuals. Kelantan is the only State to go 
against the Federal Government's decision. 
  Nik Aziz said the project would be a joint venture between 
Thames Water and Yayasan Kelantan Darulnaim (Yakin). It would 
be carried out on a privatised basis and would be for the supply 
of water to the State's water treatment plants. 
  "We hope the project will overcome the acute water shortage 
we anticipate in a few years. In fact, we are already facing 
the problem and we have to do something fast to rectify the 
situation," Nik Aziz said. He neither, however, elaborated on 
why the State Government had decided to engage a British firm 
nor disclosed the terms and conditions of the deal. [passage

  [Text] Malaysia and Albania will open new ground in 
bilateral cooperation, including an unprecedented military 
cooperation when Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak 
began his three-day official visit today to the former communist 
state. Seen as a follow-up to the historic visit by Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed last July to the eastern 
European state, Datuk Sri Najib will formally establish military 
ties with Albania under a memorandum of understanding, MOU, to 
be signed the following day. 
  Datuk Sri Najib is flying from Stockholm for the first leg 
of 
his visit to Sweden, Albania, and Croatia when he will meet 
Malaysian troops. He will also establish closer rapport and 
Islamic cooperation with his majority Muslim states. 
  Albania has 3.3 million people, more than 80 percent of them 
Muslims. According to the minister's press secretary Zulkifli 
Ali, Datuk Sri Najib will hold a dialogue session tomorrow with 
Albanian religious leaders in a Tirana mosque, built in 1793 
situated in the heart of the state capital. Like previous 
official visits by Malaysian leaders, Datuk Sri Najib is also 
expected to take the opportunity from his stay to explore 
business opportunities for Malaysians to venture in the 
redevelopment process of Albania.

<F P=106> [By Noorzita Samad] </F>
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed. -- Khazanah Holding Bhd. 
[Limited], the government's new investment holding company, can 
be expected to spearhead Malaysian investments in mega and 
strategic projects overseas. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim announced 
yesterday that Khazanah Holding, which will begin operations in 
early June, would be allowed to make additional or new 
investments in mega projects that are considered "strategic" to 
the nation either locally or abroad. 
  Khazanah Holding will also identify several strategic 
projects, which the private sector is not yet able to undertake, 
and plan the governnment's investments in them accordingly. It 
will also be allowed to raise funds in the domestic and 
international markets by issuing shares, loan stocks, or other 
types of financial instruments. "This form of financing is much 
cheaper. It will also enable the government to undertake new 
investments without resorting to its internal resources," he 
said. 
  Anwar, who is also finance minister, was speaking to 
reporters after sending off Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and 
his delegation at Bilik Bunga Raya, Kuala Lumpur International 
Airport in Subang. The prime minister, who will be Khazanah 
Holding chairman, and his delegation left for a five-day 
official visit to Zimbabwe. 
  Anwar, who will be Khazanah Holding deputy chairman, said 
the 
government's existing investment arm, the Minister of Finance 
Inc. (MoF Inc.), will be the sole shareholder in Khazanah 
Holding. Khazanah Holding has an authorised capital of RM 
[Malaysian ringgit] 500 million and a paid-up capital of RM100 
million. Anwar said Khazanah would take over the management of 
the bulk of the government's equity investment currently being 
overseen by MoF Inc. 
  "The government will identify which assets to be transferred 
to Khazanah. Not all (of the equity investments) will be placed 
under the new entity. The assets will be transferred in 
stages," he said 
  MoF Inc. holds shares in 37 companies worth RM72.5 billion 
based on the current market value and RM7.59 billion at par 
value. These include shares in listed companies like Tenaga 
Nasional Bhd. [electricity company], Telekom Malaysia Bhd., 
Edaran Otomobil Nasional Bhd. (Proton) as well as in unlisted 
ones like National Oil Corporation Petronas, Heavy Industries 
Malaysia Bhd., and Perwaja Steel Industries Sdn. Bhd. [Private 
Limited]. It is understood that initially about RM40 billion of 
the investments will be taken over by Khazanah Holding. 
  Anwar said Khazanah Holding will have six directors -- three 
from the public sector and another three from the private 
sector. "Khazanah Holding will have a team of professional 
managers. Its policy, however, will be ascertained by the Board 
of Directors chaired by the prime minister," he added. 
  Anwar said the government decided to form Khazanah Holding 
in 
view of the increasing equity investments in MoF Inc. as the 
privatisation and corporatisation of government-owned 
enterprises gained momentum in 1990s. This in turn calls for 
more professional and systematic management of the assets, he 
added. 
  Anwar said to protect the government's interests, the 
company 
is required to submit its annual statement of accounts to the 
auditor general. The documents will also be forwarded to 
Parliament. 
  Anwar also outlined various functions of the new holding 
company. These include: 

  -  Drawing up the medium-and long-term 
corporate plans for the group' participation in the private 
sector, especially in new priority areas; 
  -  preparing strategies 
to enhance efficiency, productivity, and profitability of the 
companies in its stable [as published] so that returns from the 
investments can be maximised; and 
  -  undertaking additional or new 
investments in mega projects which are "strategic" to the nation 
either locally or abroad. 
  Anwar said as the companies improved their profitability, 
Khazanah Holding is expected to receive larger dividends. "Most 
of the dividends will be channelled to the federal government, 
being the sole shareholder through the MoF Inc. The revenue 
will be used for various purposes, particularly to finance 
development projects."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Medan Riots A Warning"] </F>
  [Text] If the social tension that led to the recent riots 
in Medan is not confined to North Sumatera alone, then it should 
set alarm bells ringing in Jakarta. Since the growing incidence 
of unrest is occuring at a time of rising political 
consciousness among Indonesians, the authorities need to manage 
the underlying problems quickly and effectively in order to 
safeguard stability. As the rioting in Medan has shown, large 
public demonstrations can degenerate easily into violence that 
can cause instability, as has happened in the past. It also 
shows that much needs to be done to improve and stabilise 
labour-management relations. One issue is the degree of 
compliance by employers with the new minimum wage rate set by 
the government. Cooperation by management has not been 
forthcoming. Why else would the Supreme Court urge judges to 
punish errant employers with prison sentences? Indeed, 
President Suharto had asked employers to go beyond implementing 
the minimum rate in improving the working conditions of 
employees. Then there are questions about the effectiveness of 
the state-sponsored All-Indonesian Workers Union (SPSI) in 
representing the interest of workers. For example, a few months 
ago, the Indonesian armed forces chief, General Feisal Tanjung, 
drew attention to their plight, saying that SPSI had failed to 
function as a labour union because many of its senior officials 
were serving the interests of management instead of workers. 
  But, it must be said, the Indonesian Labour Welfare Union 
(SBSI), the country's largest independent trade union which is 
not officially recognized was pushing too hard on workers' 
right. The government had already begun to focus its attention 
on that issue. It raised the minimum wage by 26 percent for 
workers in and around Jakarta and promised to review the 
situation at a later date. It also revoked the decree 
introduced some years ago, that allowed employers to ask the 
military to intervene to end strikes. Similarly, last September, 
the government undertook to restructure SPSI in order to make it 
less centralised and, thus, more responsive to the views of its 
constituent sectoral unions. 
  Indonesia cannot afford irresponsible behaviour by labour or 
management. The SBSI's demand for almost doubling the minimum 
wage is excessive. Acceding to it would endanger economic 
growth and, thus, the country's ability to generate enough jobs 
to stem rising unemployment. According to Manpower Minister 
Abdul Latief, 38 percent of Indonesia's workforce of 81 million 
are without work or are under-employed. Even if the current 
growth rate of around 6 percent is sustained, joblessness would 
grow by 2 percent annually. Particularly troubling is high 
unemployment among university graduates. Only 30 to 40 percent 
of them are expected to be absorbed in the coming years. 
  Raising wages to an unrealistic level, especially when 
labour 
productivity is low, will lead to more unemployment because it 
will make the country less attractive to overseas investors, who 
can put in their money in other countries such as China, Vietnam 
and India, where labour is plentiful and cheap. This has 
already begun to happen. Foreign investment in Indonesia 
dropped by 22 percent last year. Investments are also needed to 
contain growth of its external debt that has reached U.S.$90 
million. The issue of workers' rights has surfaced at a 
delicate time, when the country is in the throes of social 
change, while it faces new economic challenges. 
  A firm hand is needed to stamp out trouble-makers, and to 
deter those looking for trouble. A more sophisticated and 
responsive machinery is needed to manage the delicate 
labour-management relations. However the authorities respond to 
these challenges, the Medan riots should be an eye-opener to all 
sides.

  [Text] A Singapore mission is visiting Myanmar [Burma] 
this week, further cementing ties between the two countries. 
  The eight-day construction and development mission, which 
begins today, is organised jointly by the Trade Development 
Board (TDB) and Construction Industry Development Board. 
  Representatives of 21 Singapore companies will make the trip 
to Yangon [Rangoon]. 
  The mission follows a three-day visit to Myanmar in March by 
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. 
  Singapore is Myanmar's second largest trading partner after 
China. 
  Trade between the two countries increased by 19.4 percent 
from $603.1 million [Singapore dollars] in 1992 to $720.3 
million last year, and the growth was due mainly to an increase 
in oil and non-oil domestic exports and reexports. 
  During Mr. Goh's visit, two Singapore companies signed 
memoranda of understanding with Myanmar's Ministry of Hotels and 
Tourism. 
  Keppel Group's Straits Steamship is developing a U.S. $50 
million (S [Singapore] $79 million) international-class hotel in 
Mandalay -- its second in the country -- and Kuok Singapore said 
it would invest U.S. $150 million to develop two first-class 
hotels in Yangon. 
  This week's mission is led by Mr. Fong Siew Heng, executive 
director of Low Keng Huat. The chief executive officer of 
Eastern Industries Pte. Ltd. [Private Limited], Mr. Chong Wai 
Siak, is the deputy mission leader. 
  In a statement released at the weekend, the TDB said the 
group aimed to cultivate and develop official and business 
contacts in Myanmar and to meet the relevant authorities and 
corporations involved in construction projects. Members also 
hoped to explore areas for joint cooperation. 
  Said Mr. Fong: "The mission is largely exploratory in nature 
as this will be the first trip to Myanmar for the majority of 
the participants." 
  He expressed confidence that the visit would prove an 
"eye-opener" for both parties. 
  Participating companies include major construction firms, 
developers, architects, consultant engineers, building material 
manufacturers, and a bank. Among them are Alfred Wong 
Partnership, United Engineers Singapore, First Capital 
Corporation, and United Overseas Bank. 
  The Singapore Contractors Association is also represented. 
  The TDB said business opportunities in Myanmar's 
construction 
sector were expected to increase with the opening up of the 
economy and the resulting inflow of foreign investment. 
  State enterprises, which accounted for 89 percent of output 
in Myanmar's construction sector in 1992/93, experienced strong 
growth between 1989 and 1992 as a result of the government's 
emphasis on infrastructure construction and rehabilitation, 
particularly in the capital city of Yangon. 
  Public capital expenditure for the sector totalled 1,843 
million kyat in 1992/3, or 12.5 percent of total expenditure. 
  Myanmar's imports of capital goods for the year 1991/2 
totalled U.S. $249.9 million. These included construction 
materials, machinery and equipment and transport equipment.

  [Text] Singapore registered strong growth in external trade 
last month. The volume grew more than 13 percent on a 
three-month moving average basis. The value of the total trade 
jumped about 11 percent to 24 billion dollars. Import volume 
also rose 11 percent to over 12 billion dollars. Non-oil 
exports saw a 17 percent rise in volume as shipments to both the 
U.S. and Japan recorded rises. Deliveries to the U.S. were up 
13.5 percent and a surge of 24.7 percent to Japan. This growth 
was largely in integrated circuits, computers, and computer 
peripherals. But non-oil exports to the EC dipped 2.9 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Unwarranted Pressure Commotion by </F>
Brazen-Faced Ones"] 
  [Text] In its commentary entitled "The Korean Nuclear 
Issue Which Is a U.S. Scenario," the Nepalese newspaper (CHOL 
POL) dated 4 April wrote as follows: The situation on the 
Korean peninsula has become more tense and led to the brink of 
war due to the nuclear issue. This is totally because of the 
unfriendly [piuhojok] and unfair [pulgongjonghan] attitude of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] under the 
patronage of the United States. In fact, this is nothing but a 
scenario. 
  The DPRK allowed IAEA inspections for the continuity of 
safeguards and met all conditions for the inspections as agreed 
upon with the agency. However, the IAEA Secretariat overlooked 
this fact and concocted a new scenario according to the 
instruction of the United States. Now, why is it that the IAEA 
follows the United States? It is because this organization was 
built by the United States and is under its patronage. 
  Failing to control the nuclear activities and nuclear 
weapons 
of the United States, the largest nuclear possessor state in the 
world, the IAEA has instead protected them. The United States 
insists on the suspicion that North Korea is developing nuclear 
weapons. This is aimed at unconditionally applying pressure on 
this country, looking down on and regarding it as a small 
country. The United States is employing military pressure and 
threat. 
  As the Nepalese paper's commentary correctly indicates, in 
reality, the United States and the IAEA have been tenaciously 
waging an unwarranted pressure commotion against us by 
continuously coming up with the issue of implementing the 
safeguards agreement. This can be seen in the so-called 
statement issued recently by the president of the UN Security 
Council which called for the overall implementation of the 
safeguards agreement. Talk on implementation of the safeguards 
agreement is nothing but a far-fetched assertion lacking 
justification, because our country is, above all, in a unique 
situation of having temporarily suspended the effectuation of 
the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. 
  Our country's unique position was caused by the unwarranted 
acts of the United States and the IAEA. This is a fact 
officially recognized by the world. As is known, on 12 March of 
last year, we issued a statement to withdraw from the NPT in 
order to defend the socialist fatherland and the supreme 
interest of the nation. This was our Republic's extremely just, 
self-defending step against the U.S. nuclear threat and the 
IAEA's partiality. 
  However, later, as the United States responded to the 
proposal for DPRK-U.S. talks, we unilaterally suspended the 
effectuation of the withdrawal from the NPT temporarily under 
the condition that DPRK-U.S. negotiations for a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear issue continue on an equal and fair 
basis. This, however, does not mean a return to the treaty. 
Therefore, we are not obligated to implementing the safeguards 
agreement pursuant to the legal requirement for the treaty as 
treaty signatory countries are. This is particularly so 
considering the fact that, from a legal standpoint, the effect 
of the safeguards accord is in a virtual state of suspension. 
  Proceeding from our country's unique position, we have 
heretofore only received inspections to assure the mere 
continuity of safeguards, and not the regular and irregular 
inspections [chonggyu and pijonggyu sachal] pursuant to the 
safeguards accord which were frozen. As to our unique position, 
the United States and the IAEA Secretariat, as well, could not 
but recognize it. Nevertheless, the United States and the IAEA 
have been unreasonablly calling for the overall implementation 
of the safeguards agreement. 
  This vividly shows that they are attempting to use the 
safeguards accord as leverage for the realization of their 
insidious political purposes of refusing our unique position and 
crushing our Republic. We can never completely implement the 
safeguards accord unless the United States and the IAEA assure 
in their actions that they will not crush our Republic. 
  As the world is well aware, our signature of the safeguards 
accord with the IAEA was based on the premise that the 
depository states should neither deploy their nuclear weapons on 
the Korean peninsula nor pose any nuclear threat against us. 
Nevertheless, such a premise of ours has not been addressed at 
all. Rather, the United States, which is one of the depository 
states, is further posing a nuclear threat against us by openly 
making public that it will resume the Team Spirit joint military 
exercise, a test nuclear war against us, in November and by 
concentrating new type nuclear weapons, including Patriot 
missiles--which are mass destruction weapons--and other 
aggression armed forces on and around the Korean peninsula. 
  Our allowance of the inspection for the sheer assurance of 
continuity of safeguards corresponding to our unique position 
even under such a touch-and-go, dangerous situation is precisely 
our justified step. Inspections to assure the continuity of 
safeguards is enough to clearly prove that our nuclear materials 
have not been utilized for nonpeaceful purposes. We will never 
allow inspection activities which are equivalent to regular and 
irregular inspections unless the United States suspends its 
policy of obliterating the DPRK and its nuclear threat 
commotions and unless the IAEA Secretariat eliminates its 
partiality. 
  If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our 
unique position, the nuclear issue will be smoothly resolved. 
We do not mean we will maintain our unique position forever. 
How long it can continue depends on the acts of the United 
States and the IAEA Secretariat. 
  The day when our unique position comes to an end will be the 
day when DPRK-U.S. talks are held and the immediate steps of 
simultaneous action for a complete solution to the nuclear issue 
under the principle of a package deal solution are put into 
practice. In this case, conditions for the complete 
implementation of the safeguards accord can be provided. 
  In the final part of its commentary, the Nepalese newspaper 
wrote: Western countries are now exerting all possible 
diplomatic efforts to isolate the DPRK, a small country. 
However, no matter how hard the West world may clamor, DPRK 
socialism will be ever victorious as no force in the world can 
crush [apsal] Korea. Western countries should realize this. 
  Pressure is not a way to solve the problem. Trying to solve 
the nuclear issue through peaceful means such as dialogue and 
negotiations is precisely our consistent position. Developments 
in the situation [satae palchon] depend entirely on the attitude 
of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat.

<F P=106> ["Entirely Just Compatriotic Step" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- A NODONG SINMUN 
analyst today says it is an entirely just compatriotic step both 
from the humanitarian and national point of view that the North 
side recently proposed to the South side through a telephone 
message that Kim Chi-hyon, now an inpatient of the hospital 
attached to Hanyang National University in Seoul, be brought to 
the North for medical treatment. 
  Noting that Kim Chi-hyon, the first-born daughter of Kim 
Pyong- chu, an unconverted prisoner who died a few years ago 
after his release from prison, is a righteous-minded girl who 
attended on Yi In-mo, a former war correspondent of the Korean 
People's Army, when he was in a critical condition after a 
cerebral haemorrhage at the Pusan University Hospital, the news 
analyst says: 
  She had to have her ribs cut off in an operation for T.B. 
pyothorax at the hospital. Now, she is in a very critical 
condition, the inflammation spreading to the region of vertebrae. 
  She is aware that even a moment's suspension of treatment 
will endanger her life. Yet, she is intending to leave the 
hospital. She has to take care of three younger brother and 
sisters without anyone to rely on, and is unable to pay the 
daily increasing charges for hospitalization and operation. 
  We, as fellow countrymen, can never overlook the miserable 
situation of the 29-year-old fragile girl who is suffering from 
both a serious disease and mental ailments. 
  We deem it our bounden duty and obligation to fetch them to 
the northern half of the country at an early date to give 
medical treatment and take care of their life. 
  At present, a state of acute confrontation has been created 
between the North and the South. But that must not be an 
obstacle to the transfer of Kim Chi-hyon to the North. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst says the South Korean Red Cross must 
take an appropriate step at an early date to ensure that Kim 
Chi-hyon and her three brother and sisters receive medical 
treatment and be granted protection for their life in the 
northern half of the country, as proposed by the North.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party in a statement 
issued Monday sharply denounces the feverish acceleration of the 
development of nuclear weapons by the Kim Yong-sam group, 
branding it as an undisguised perfidy in reducing the joint 
declaration on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula to 
waste paper and a never- to-be-condoned criminal act aimed at 
destroying the nation. 
  Recalling that the South Korean ruling quarters have pursued 
a policy of developing nuclear weapons from the early 1970s, the 
statement warns that if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula 
owing to the reckless military provocations of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets, it will, no doubt, 
develop into a nuclear war, inflicting an irrevocable nuclear 
scourge upon the Korean peninsula and its surrounding countries. 
  The statement demands that the Kim Yong-sam group promptly 
stop the development of nuclear weapons which would bring 
horrible disasters to the nation and dismantle the pressurized 
heavy water reactor (PHWR) and multi-purpose research reactor. 
  Noting that the United States is the very one standing in 
the 
way of the solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula, the statement urges the United States to come out to 
the DPRK-USA negotiating table for a fundamental solution of the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency which has so far 
resorted to a double standard, abandoning the principle of 
impartiality in nuclear inspections, should apologize for the 
fact that it has joined the United States in its anti-DPRK 
campaign and closed its eyes to the development of nuclear 
weapons through the PHWR for military use and the multi-purpose 
research reactor by the South Korean puppets, the statement says.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Bellicose Nature Cannot be </F>
Concealed"] 
  [Text] The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique frantically staged 
the so-called Hwarang war exercise in Inchon and the areas of 
Kyonggi Province during 25-29 April. 
  The puppets are now raving that this war was aimed at 
countering someone's infiltration and enhancing defense 
preparedness. However, this is nothing but a sophism to mislead 
the media at home and abroad and to conceal their bellicose 
nature. 
  The entire world officially recognizes that there is no such 
threat of a southward invasion on the Korean peninsula. Even 
though the puppets are raising a clamor as though we would at 
once invade the South, many patriotic figures who have visited 
the Northern half of the Republic unanimously say that there was 
no such moves, and that they have not detected any of those 
moves, and that North Korean society is in peace. 
  Not long ago, traitor Kim Yong-sam himself virtually denied 
the rumors on the threat of a southward invasion by saying that 
the rumors on the war crisis on the Korean peninsula stemmed 
from the U.S. media's irresponsible reports. This vividly 
proves the absurdity of the rumors on the threat of a southward 
invasion babbled by the puppets. 
  There is no such southward invasion but a northward invasion 
on the Korean peninsula. This can be clearly seen in the 
content of operations and the massive number of personnel that 
were mobilized in staging the recent exercise. 
  In the recent Hwarang exercise, the Kim Yong-sam clique 
mobilized the puppet army, navy, and air force and police, and 
reserve forces -- over 1.3 million in all -- and perpetrated a 
surprise mobilization exercise, a joint operation among Army, 
Navy, and Air force, an airborne-operation, and a land operation 
in an atmosphere of real warfare. What is more, they are 
bluffing of a war-winning posture in the event of the firm 
establishment of an emergency situation. 
  Denial of rumors on the war crisis while staging the Hwarang 
war exercise and babbling about the firmness of war-winning 
posture, clearly show that such war an exercise is part of their 
maneuvers to provoke a war of aggression against the North. 
  As a matter of fact, it is an established fact that the 
South 
Korean puppets are attempting to provoke a war of aggression 
against the North with the U.S. imperialists. 
  The U.S. imperialists, on the pretext of stopping the 
North's 
nuclear development, have not withdrawn their naval armed forces 
concentrated on the waters of the Korean peninsula. Worse 
still, they say they are ready for war and are massively 
introducing combat equipment, including the latest-type Patriot 
missiles and Apache attack helicopters into South Korea. 
  In the meantime, the South Korean puppets, along with the 
U.S. imperialists, have mapped out a northward invasion plan 
called the New Operation Plan 5027 and are playing with fire to 
carry it into practice. 
  The U.S. imperialists have perpetrated aerial espionage on 
the northern half of Korea on 250 occasions in April alone. 
This clearly shows how desperately the rascals are running 
about in their maneuvers for a war of aggression against the 
North. 
  Timed to coincide with this, the Kim Yong-sam clique staged 
the Hwarang exercise by mobilizing the puppet army, police, and 
reservists. It is obvious that the Hwarang war exercise is 
aimed at provoking a war of aggression against the North to 
drive not only the puppet army but also the para-military forces 
and inhabitants into it. The puppet clique cannot by any means 
conceal its bellicose nature, and only runs out to the road of 
confrontation and war. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique's criminal acts of rejecting the 
fellow countrymen's proposal on convening a great national 
meeting; turning the Korean peninsula into a war ground; 
becoming a vanguard of implementing the U.S. policies of 
invasion and war; and bringing in the fiery cloud of war on the 
Korean peninsula will never be tolerated. 
  We (?want dialogue), but we are not in any sense afraid of 
war. If the puppets set the fire of war on this land, our people 
and our People's Army will rise as one to provide the rascals 
with ignominious defeat. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should look squarely at the 
unshakable will of our people who do not say empty words, and 
should not act recklessly like a puppy with no fear of a tiger.

<F P=106> ["War Hysterics" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
Monday [2 May] summoned officials of the "Unification and 
Security Policy Coordinating Council," groundlessly vilified the 
North over fictitious "increase of military exercises" and 
"ordered" the entire puppet Armed Forces to take a "round- 
the-clock maximum alert posture," according to a radio report 
from Seoul. 
  This is a step to mobilize the puppet Armed Forces in a war 
against the North any moment. This shows the puppets' plan to 
unleash a war against the North has reached a very dangerous 
stage. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's order to the puppet Defence 
Ministry came in the wake of U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's 
recent visit to South Korea during which he had military confabs 
to carry out new Operation Plan 5027, a war scenario against the 
North. It is clear what the order is aimed at. 
  The fact eloquently proves that the U.S. imperialists and 
the South Korean puppets are the very ones driving the situation 
on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war and their reckless 
new war provocation moves are a main factor of an unpredictable 
event. 
  The outcry of the Kim Yong-sam clique over the "increase of 
military exercises in the North" is no more than a trick to 
mislead public opinion and justify its new war provocation moves. 
  Lurking behind it is a sinister intention to lull the strong 
fighting spirit of the South Korean people for ousting the Kim 
Yong- sam puppet clique and divert their attention elsewhere. 
  Facts show the Kim Yong-sam clique is a group of traitors 
who 
are indifferent to peace in the country and harmony of the 
nation and seek confrontation and war to place the nation on the 
altar of big powers at the instigation of outside forces.

<F P=106> ["Righteous Struggle of South Korean Students Cannot Be </F>
Blocked" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The current anti-U.S., 
anti-war, anti-"government" struggle mounting among the South 
Korean students is a righteous struggle, which shows their 
strong will to defend the dignity and interests of the nation, 
declares NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. 
  Recalling that the South Korean Federation of General 
Student 
Councils (Hanchongnyon) at a press conference on April 25 on the 
first anniversary of its inauguration expressed the 
determination to intensify the anti-U.S., anti-Kim Yong-sam 
struggle, saying there is nothing to expect from the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet regime, the analyst goes on: 
  The U.S. imperialists are deploying massive reinforcements 
of 
the aggression forces including Patriot missiles in South Korea, 
crying for the resumption of the "Team Spirit" nuclear war 
exercises and staging war gambles against the DPRK almost every 
day together with the puppets, while putting an undisguised 
pressure on the DPRK in the international arena over its 
"nuclear issue". 
  Unable to tolerate the dignity and interests of the nation 
being encroached upon by outside forces and the beloved fellow 
countrymen being threatened with a nuclear disaster, the South 
Korean students have risen up valiantly in the anti-U.S., 
anti-war struggle to remove their root cause. 
  The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique are now running about like a 
headless chicken to block the righteous and patriotic struggle 
of the students. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam clique ruthlessly cracking down on 
their righteous struggle will face curses and denunciation by 
the whole nation. 
  The just struggle of the South Korean students cannot be 
blocked with anything.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Just Struggle of South Korean </F>
Youth and Students"] 
  [Text] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: 
The South Korean youth and students have played a vanguard and 
leading role in promoting the South Korean people's just 
anti-U.S. struggle and their struggle for independence, 
antifascist democratization, and national reunification. Our 
nation is proud of their heroic struggles. 
  Today youth and students are vigorously struggling to pull 
out outside forces and their nuclear weapons from South Korea. 
As has been already reported, the United States has largely 
reinforced and deployed its arms of aggression to South Korea 
under the pretext of the nuclear issue and has aggravated 
tensions on the Korean peninsula along with the puppets. Such a 
criminal act by the United States has aroused the indignation 
and protest of the South Korean youth, students, and people from 
all walks of life. 
  On 19 April, approximately 500 youth and students waged a 
harsh anti-U.S. demonstration in front of the U.S. Cultural 
Center in Taegu, shouting slogans that they oppose the 
introduction of Patriot missiles to South Korea, as well as the 
National Assembly's ratification of the opening of agricultural 
product markets. On the same day, when they failed to occupy 
the U.S. Cultural Center because of the violent oppression by 
the combat police forces, the demonstrators continued to bravely 
fight against them, thus throwing stones at them. On 18 April, 
youth and students in Taegu held a rally in front of the Taegu 
department store to mark the 34th anniversary of the 19 April 
people's uprising and condemned the nation-selling and 
treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique's antinational and flunkeyist 
act. 
  The National Alliance of College Students Organization 
[Hanchongnyon], a mass-oriented struggling organization which is 
made up of the South Korean youth and students, declared that it 
would reaffirm that the anti-U.S. struggle is particularly a 
basic road to the nation's democratic movement, saying that the 
movement for independence, democracy, and reunification must be 
earnestly carried out. Thus, it has bravely risen up to 
participate in the just struggle of the South Korean youth and 
students under the resolution that it will take the lead in 
promoting the nation's just anti-U.S. struggle and their 
struggle for independence that will defend the nation's 
existence and dignity. 
  On 20 April, approximately 150 Hanchonnyon students 
penetrated into the building of the puppet Defense Ministry in 
which the U.S. secretary of defense and the puppet defense 
minister had plotted together a war conspiracy and waged 
demonstrations under the placards entitled "We Oppose the United 
States and the Visit by William Perry; We Don't Want a War; and 
Yankee Go Home." Also a group of youth and students in Seoul 
waged demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul by 
breaking through a tightly-guarded siege of police, shouting the 
anti-U.S. slogans "We Hate Patriot Missiles" and "We Hate 
William Perry." 
  The anti-U.S. struggle vigorously waged in South Korea has 
been further reinforced along with the antigovernment struggle. 
Participants in the struggle have denounced that the puppet Kim 
Yong-sam clique is more treacherous and flunkeyist than any 
other South Korean rulers in the past. 
  According to a decision by Hanchongnyon, students in Pusan 
-- who resolved on 8 April to go on strike, hold rallies, and 
stage demonstrations against the National Assembly's 
ratification of the opening of the agricultural product market 
-- continued struggles even until later that night and, thus, 
made the nation-selling and treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique 
shudder. 
  Approximately 1,000 students, who participated in the 
struggle waged during the daytime, carried out an offensive and 
defensive battle against the combat police force units for 
nearly three hours from 1900 to 2200 that day. 
  Youths and students -- who are infuriated at the South 
Korean 
authorities' antinational opening of agricultural product 
markets -- even attacked the branch offices of the Democratic 
Liberal Party in Kwangju and in Taegu. 
  In Kwangju, approximately 400 youths and students staged 
demonstrations in front of the South Cholla Provincial local 
branch of the Democratic Liberal Party and continued struggles 
by throwing some 50 paint bottles at its branch building and 
shouting slogans that called upon the government not to sign the 
Uruguay Round accord. 
  The students of Myongji, Yonsei, and Hongik Universities, 
who 
belong to the western district branch office of the Seoul 
District Federation of General Students, have also waged the 
just struggle. On 26 April, approximately 700 students held 
rallies and demonstrations to mark the 3d anniversary of the 
death of student Kang Kyong-tae, thus raging against the fascist 
murders. Participants in rallies prayed for the bliss of their 
fellow student who sacrificed himself in the sacred struggle for 
independence, democracy, and reunification and then strongly 
condemned the military fascist elements who had mercilessly 
killed the young patriotic student. 
  Through their practical struggles, the South Korean youths 
and students have been clearly aware that the aspiration of the 
youths, students, and people for independence, democracy, and 
reunification can never be achieved as long as there are outside 
forces remaining in South Korea. The outside forces will be 
also doomed to a greater disaster. 
  Therefore, the South Korean youth, students, and people are 
now vigorously conducting the anti-U.S. and antigovernment 
struggles to save the fellow countrymen's lives -- which are 
more important than their youth and lives -- even under a 
warlike atmosphere in which the fascists act rashly. 
  The wise and brave youths and students in South Korea -- who 
strongly call for the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces from South 
Korea despite the fascists' clubs and bullets -- will continue 
to fight on until the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea are 
fully withdrawn from this land. This is the will and vigor of 
our youths and students in the colonial South, as well as the 
unanimous voices of the South Korean youths, students, and 
people. Thanks to the struggle of the wise and brave youths, 
students, and the people, South Korea has been turned today into 
an anti-U.S. struggling place where the struggles are waged more 
harshly. 
  The puppet South Korean clique should be clearly aware of 
the 
will and faith of youths, students, and people who aspire for 
independence, democracy, and reunification. They should act 
with discretion. The wise and brave youths, students, and 
people in South Korea should firmly cooperate with each other 
under the anti-U.S. and antiwar banner. As a result, they will 
more vigorously carry out the struggles to achieve independence, 
democracy, and national reunification.

  [Excerpt] The North Korean Ambassador to Thailand, Yi 
To-sop, yesterday said the United States' arms build-up on the 
Korean Peninsula was a main reason for North Korea's call for a 
new peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice agreement. 
  In an interview with THE NATION, Yi accused the United 
States 
of "openly" violating the ceasefire agreement by sending Patriot 
missiles to the peninsula in addition to several other previous 
"covert" violations. "This is considered paralyzing the 
agreement," said Yi. 
  The armistice was signed between the US command, a US-led 
coalition of troops from 16 Western allies, and North Korea in 
1953 to halt the 1950-1953 Korean War. The two Koreas are 
technically still at war in the absence of a peace treaty. 
  In reaffirming the North Korean Foreign Ministry's April 28 
statement, the ambassador said a new peace treaty was necessary 
to establish a new peace security system and to prevent an arms 
build- up and the recurrence of war. 
  Pyongyang on Thursday also proposed direct negotiations with 
Washington on a new treaty. The proposal was rejected by both 
Washington and Seoul, which said it was a tactic to divert the 
world's attention from nuclear tension caused by North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons program. 
  US officials said the peace accord was a matter between 
North 
and South Korea, not the United States and was a separate matter 
from the nuclear row. They said the settlement of the nuclear 
issue was an imperative. 
  Yi also accused Washington of meddling in an inspection in 
March by an International Atomic Energy Agency team by 
presenting unacceptable conditions. 
  The ambassador said there should be no conditions for future 
international nuclear inspections of North Korean nuclear 
facilities. 
  Yi said the whole thing was a US ploy to pressure North 
Korea 
to open up the country and its market. This was much the same 
as the way the United States used human rights issues to coax 
China to free up its market to US products, he said. [passage

<F P=106> ["Aggression Forces Targeted Against Asian Countries" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The U.S. bellicose 
quarters' cries for reinforcement of the U.S. Forces stationed 
in Japan allegedly to "cope with the increasing danger of 
disputes" show they still pursue the policy of strength toward 
Korea and Asia, stresses NODONG SINMUN in a bylined article 
today. 
  The article says: 
  The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries claim that the 
maintenance and reinforcement of the U.S. Forces in Japan is 
something for "Japan-U.S. security." But it is a lie, a 
deception and a mockery of the peaceloving peoples in Asia and 
the rest of the world. 
  The purpose of the U.S. strategy toward Asia is to dominate 
and control the Asian countries with strength. In this the 
United States is going to use its ally Japan close to the Asian 
continent as well as South Korea as a military foothold and 
bridgehead. 
  In Japan there are more than 120 U.S. bases and setups, 
about 
50,000 U.S. troops and large quantities of military hardware. 
  The U.S. troops and bases in Japan are a product of the U.S. 
cold war policy. Now that the cold war has ended, they must be 
withdrawn. 
  The United States' reinforcement of its forces in Japan 
shows 
it schemes to realise its aggressive designs on Asian countries 
at any cost. 
  The major task and function of the U.S. troops and bases in 
Japan are to maintain U.S. military threat and ensure its armed 
intervention in Asia. The basic mission of the U.S. Forces in 
Japan is, in a nutshell, to play the role of a shock brigade in 
the aggressive Asia strategy of the United States. 
  The aggressive nature of the U.S. troops and bases in Japan 
finds graphic expression in that they never stay away from the 
war exercises staged in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  They were feverishly active in Rimpac, Pacex and other 
large- 
scale military exercises, which were not for "U.S.- Japan 
security" but against Asian countries. 
  By keeping its aggression forces and military bases in 
Japan, the United States plans to prevent Japan's deviation from 
its track of war and strengthen the U.S.-Japan military 
integration. The United States installed nuclear bases in 
Japan, armed its troops in Japan with nuclear weapons and turned 
Japan into an "unsinkable nuclear aircraft carrier," increasing 
the danger. 
  This proves that the United States uses its forces in Japan 
as a lever to gain nuclear predominance in Asia and threaten and 
attack other countries with nuclear weapons. 
  It must not go unnoticed that the operations of the U.S. 
Forces in Japan focus on Korea. They are on alert for operation 
in Korea any moment. The description of the forces as a 
"deterrent to disputes" by the U.S. ruling circles is a sophism. 
  The U.S. Forces and bases in Japan are the root cause of 
threat to the sovereignty and independence, peace and security 
of Korea and other Asian countries. Nothing can conceal their 
dangerous nature.

<F P=106> ["Prompt Halt to Anti-Chongnyon Moves Urged" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 1 (KCNA) -- Papers here today say the 
recent grave hostile acts against organizations of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans 
in Japan are unprecedented since the formation of Chongnyon and 
they are premeditated and organized provocations of the Japanese 
reactionaries who have resorted to anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon 
moves, motivated by a sinister political aim. 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst says: 
  Very ill-boding is the situation today when the Japanese 
reactionaries are intensifying crackdown on and persecution of 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan. 
  Koreans in Japan are those who were forcibly taken to Japan 
by the Japanese imperialists during their colonial rule, and 
their descendents, and Chongnyon is a patriotic and democratic 
organization of citizens overseas of the DPRK. 
  It is a legal and moral obligation of the Japanese 
authorities to guarantee legitimate activities of Chongnyon and 
the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan. 
  Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities forcibly searched 
Chongnyon organizations by invoking government power on charges 
of "forcible obstruction of business" which had nothing to do 
with Chongnyon and goaded a rightwing gangsters' group on to 
undisguised suppression and provocations against Chongnyon and 
Koreans in Japan. This is an unjustifiable, rude behavior. 
  We who regard the dignity of our country and nation as our 
life and soul will consider any crackdown on Chongnyon and its 
affiliated organizations and Koreans in Japan an encroachment on 
the dignity and sovereignty of our Republic and decisively 
counter it. 
  The Japanese authorities should ponder over unpredictable 
grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless behavior and 
immediately renounce their policy hostile to the DPRK and 
anti-Chongnyon moves.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 30 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- 
Japanese figures of different circles held a meeting for 
thinking of Japan-Korea friendship in Kyoto on April 23. 
  Speeches were made at the meeting attended by Azuma Okuda, 
chairman of the International Higher Institute; Hiroshi 
Wakabayashi, secretary general of the Japan Committee for 
Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea; 
Hisateru Mitsuda, honorary professor at Kyoto University; and 
other political, public and academic figures and men of the 
press, 400 in all. 
  Liberal-democratic member of the House of Representatives 
Hiromu Nonaka in his speech charged that the Japanese ruling 
coalition was spreading anti-DPRK public opinion over the 
"nuclear problem" of the DPRK. 
  "The Japanese people" he said "should strive to make the 
relations with the DPRK very close ties and restore Japan- Korea 
friendship and confidence." 
  Prof. Motofumi Asai at Meijigakuin University in his speech 
pointed out that the United States is crying over the "nuclear 
problem" of DPRK for the purpose of putting down public opinion 
for disarmament at home. 
  Honorary Prof. Toshiyuki Toyota at Nagoya University in his 
speech said the Japanese media were distorting facts by quoting 
a part of Western reports and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency was applying a double-standard policy regarding the 
"nuclear problem" of the DPRK. 
  Lawyer Yoshihiro Sorano said that, in view of Japan-Korea 
friendship, the issue of postwar settlement must be solved 
properly and the conditions of the Koreans in Japan be improved.

Rica, Humberto Vargas Carbonel, secretary general of the Central 
Committee of the People's Vanguard of Costa Rica, Stevan

of Korea should be solved through DPRK-USA negotiations, not by

the Korean peninsula and that the International Atomic Energy 
Agency should act with discretion in accordance with its mission

Schools", a famous work of the great leader President Kim 
Il-song, on May 3, 1974. 
  Speeches were made under the subjects "The great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song's famous work 'On Some Tasks for Improving

way of developing education in schools to a new, higher stage in 
keeping with the requirements of modelling the whole society on 
the chuche idea" and "The idea of enhancing the sense of

students to be revolutionaries boundlessly loyal to the party 
and the leader". 
  The speakers said the work of President Kim Il-song is a 
great ideological and theoretical weapon which gives 
comprehensive answers to theoretical and practical questions 
arising in developing education in schools to a new, higher

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was 
held in Pyongyang today in celebration of May Day, the 
international holiday of the world workers. 
  Present at the meeting were Vice-president Yi Chong-ok and 
Vice- Premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam, Politburo 
members of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of 
Korea [WPK], and other senior party and government officials. 
  Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the C.C., the WPK, made the 
report under the title "Let Us Powerfully Promote the 
Revolutionary Cause of the Working Class, the Cause of 
Socialism, Under the Banner of Independence Against Imperialism." 
  The more than a century long period since the working class 
began celebrating the militant holiday demonstrating its 
international solidarity and united strength has been a history 
of a righteous struggle waged by the world working class 
strenuously for the freedom and liberation of the maltreated 
proletarian masses against the imperialist reactionary forces 
under the banner of unity, and its brilliant victory, the 
reporter said. 
  He quoted the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as saying: 
  "Unity is the mightiest weapon of the working class. Since 
its first days in the arena of history, the working class has 
always regarded unity as its most precious weapon in the 
struggle against international capital, and on the strength of 
unity it has won formidable struggles." 
  The reporter continued: 
  In some countries in recent years socialism which had been 
defended and developed for tens of years suffered a setback and 
capitalism has been restored. Taking advantage of this abnormal 
situation, the imperialists and reactionaries vilify the idea of 
socialism, the idea of the working class, itself as wrong, 
claiming that socialism has met its "end." But this is no more 
than a reactionary sophism of the foes of socialism and its 
renegades. 
  Drawing attention to the widespread movement for the revival 
of socialism in the countries where it has suffered a setback, 
the reporter said: 
  If the working class of all countries of the world is to 
defend the cause of socialism and promote it, it must constantly 
strengthen the driving force of the revolution with a correct 
guiding idea and must resolutely uphold the principles of 
socialism and strengthen solidarity based on independence. 
  The whole course of our revolution, the reporter declared, 
has been a history of brilliant victory in which the independent 
driving force of revolution has been reinforced under the 
guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the 
revolution has made a long drive in reliance upon its might. 
  In our country, today, the revolutionary cause of chuche 
pioneered by the great leader is being successfully carried 
forward and developed with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
possessed of the personality and traits as the leader of the 
working class and the leader of the people, acclaimed at the 
head of the party, the state and the Army, the reporter stressed. 
  The experience of our revolution in powerfully advancing the 
cause of socialism under an extraordinarily difficult 
international environment, he continued, proves that the 
independence and sovereignty of each country can be defended, 
imperialism can be defeated with united international 
revolutionary forces and a peaceful and prosperous new world of 
independence can certainly be built, when the working class of 
all lands closely unite under the revolutionary banner of 
independence against imperialism and wage a common struggle, 
supporting and cooperating with each other. 
  Pointing out that the imperialists and the reactionary 
forces 
are becoming all the more feverish in their campaign to stifle 
the revolutionary cause of the working class, the cause of 
socialism, and they are directing the sharp edge of their attack 
to the DPRK, the bastion of socialism, in particular, the 
reporter continued: 
  The U.S. imperialists and the international reactionaries 
are 
desperately trying to isolate and stifle our Republic and 
destroy Korean-style socialism under the pretext of "nuclear 
issue". But, if they think they can "subdue" us by pressure or 
threat, it is an anachronistic dream. 
  Our dignified people will never beg for peace, however dear 
it may be to them. They are fully prepared to answer war with 
war, and dialogue with dialogue. 
  We have the wise guidance of the great leader and Comrade 
Kim 
Chong-il, the respected supreme commander, the harmonious whole 
of the leader, the party and the masses and the 
a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary Armed Forces which can 
defeat any formidable enemy at one stroke and a powerful 
independent economy. 
  Our working class and the people will never tolerate our 
national dignity and sovereignty being encroached upon. 
  If the enemy dare pounce upon us, the whole country will 
become a bomb and give death to the enemy. 
  The working class and people of all countries must firmly 
unite and join hands in their struggle under the revolutionary 
banner of independence against imperialism when the imperialists 
and the reactionaries are viciously working to violate the 
independence of the popular masses and stifle the socialist 
cause by an allied force. Only then can they frustrate the 
interventionist and aggressive moves of the imperialists and 
successfully accomplish the cause of global independence. 
  Our party and people will as ever constantly develop the 
bonds of comradely unity and international solidarity with the 
progressive people of the world on the basis of the idea of 
independence, equality and socialism, remaining faithful to the 
idea of independence, peace and friendship, thus making an 
active contribution to the common cause of mankind to put an end 
to imperialist domination and interference and defend and 
advance the cause of socialism, declared Kim Chung-nin. 
  A letter to the workers all over the world was adopted at 
the 
meeting. 
  It called upon the workers all over the world to fight 
vigorously to democratize the international community and 
establish a new equitable international economic order against 
the old politics of domination and subjugation on the part of 
imperialists. 
  It appealed to the workers and trade unions worldwide to 
form 
a broader anti-imperialist joint action front and push ahead 
forcefully with the cause of independence of mankind under the 
slogan "Workers of the world advocating independence, unite!" 
  An appeal to the South Korean workers was adopted at the 
meeting. 
  The appeal expressed the conviction that the South Korean 
workers will more daringly fight to check and frustrate the new 
war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges 
through a valiant anti-war, anti-nuke struggle and accelerate 
the independent and peaceful reunification of the country in 
order to regain their democratic rights and vital rights.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 1 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate editorials to May Day, the revolutionary holiday of the 
world's working class. 
  The editorial of NODONG SINMUN headlined "The Revolutionary 
Cause of Working Class of the World Will Certainly Emerge 
Victorious" says the revolutionary cause of the working class 
for building socialism and communism is an ever-victorious, 
invincible cause forever for its just and noble idea. 
  We should wage a vigorous struggle to defend the socialist 
cause of chuche, more deeply cherishing the faith in the 
invincibility of the cause of socialism, the editorial notes, 
and goes on: 
  We should thoroughly hold fast to the chuche-based 
revolutionary lines and policies set forth by the party and the 
leader with the unshakable conviction that our cause of 
socialism will certainly win victory as we are guided by the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a distinguished thinker and 
theoretician, statesman and great military strategist. 
  In order to press ahead with socialist construction in our 
country and defend the cause of socialism as a whole, it is 
important to strengthen unity and solidarity with the working 
class of the world, decisively smash the moves of the 
anti-reunification forces and more vigorously struggle to bring 
earlier the reunification of the country. 
  Today many revolutionary parties and people fighting in 
defence of socialism are strengthening international solidarity, 
taking the Pyongyang declaration as their common fighting 
programme. 
  Our working class and people will make positive efforts to 
unite with the people of socialist countries and non-aligned 
countries on the principle of independence and constantly 
develop good neighbourly, friendly relations with the peoples of 
all countries who respect the sovereignty of our country. 
  Brighter prospects have opened up before the people who 
aspire after independence and socialism. 
  The revolutionary cause of the world working class for 
realizing the noble desire of progressive mankind will certainly 
emerge victorious. 
  MINJU CHOSON carries an editorial headlined "Let the World 
Working Class Firmly Unite and Accelerate the Cause of 
Independence".

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The tradition of Army- 
civilian unity is being fully displayed in the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea. 
  Soldiers take the utmost care of and love civilians and help 
them with all sincerity, upholding the idea of Army-civilian 
unity of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, Supreme Commander 
of the Korean People's Army. 
  Recently, soldiers of the Kim Song-un unit, while defending 
the motherland as firm as a rock, built fashionable dwelling 
houses for 72 families and delivered them to villagers. 
  Army units including the Han Kye-sun and Kang Sang-sop units 
have actively helped nearby cooperative farms in their 
springtime farming with manpower and materials and looked after 
the life of families of soldiers who fell in the fatherland 
liberation war, and people's army dependents. 
  Many soldiers went to coal and ore mines, cooperative farms 
and other units of the national economy during their leave and 
gave a helping hand to the working people there. 
  People's Army soldiers also built reservoirs and bridges 
across rivers and streams for villagers. "Army-civilian fields", 
"Army- civilian bridges" and "Army-civilian reservoirs" can be 
seen in many places of the country. 
  Kim Myong-su, Chon Chang-kun reservoir and farm's fields. 
  Civilians also take a warm care of people's army soldiers, 
regarding them as their own flesh and blood. 
  Many organs, enterprises and cooperative farms [word 
indistinct] hospital, the Yonsan garment factory and the 
Mangyongdae cooperative farm recently sincerely aided the 
People's Army. And cities and counties in North and South 
Pyongan Provinces including Anju, Tokchon and Kaechon Cities and 
Kujang and Yongbyon Counties have assiduously rendered material 
and moral aid to the People's Army soldiers participating in the 
construction of the Pyongyang-Hyangsan express highway. 
  Some time ago, an administrative district where Choe Un-hak 
works sent several hundred thousand pieces of comfort articles 
to people's army soldiers. 
  "Our post-our school" and "our village-our post" movements 
now are in full swing throughout the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- The Literature and Art 
Press Group of Korea recently brought out a long novel 
"Victory", a follow-up of the cycle of novels "Immortal History" 
(postliberation part). 
  The novel gives an epical depiction of the leadership feats, 
outstanding commandership and noble virtues of the respected 
leader President Kim Il-song who humbled the arrogant U.S. 
imperialists who boasted of being the "strongest" in the world 
and reduced them to the lot of the setting sun by leading the 
fatherland liberation war, a war of justice for the Korean 
people, to a shining victory. It also tells about the 
indomitable fighting spirit of the Korean people and Army. 
  The novel consisting of three parts covers the period from 
August 1952, when the war was going on at the last stage, to 
July 1953, till the brilliant victory of the war. 
  The first part deals with mid-1952 when armistice talks were 
under way at Panmunjom and the Korean war seemed to come to an 
end through the talks. It gives an emotional representation of 
the matchless grit, indomitable will and rare military 
intelligence of President Kim Il-song who inflicted an 
ignominous defeat, with telling blows, on the U.S. imperialists 
who were running amuck indiscreetly, not knowing what the Korean 
people were like. 
  The second part portrays in various aspects the traits of 
President Kim Il-song who smashed at one stroke Eisenhower's 
"new offensive" with chuche-based war methods and unique and 
superb tactics and opened up a decisive phase for victory in the 
war. 
  The third part vividly shows the wise leadership of 
President 
Kim Il-song, an ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander 
and great military strategist, in totally crushing the 
last-ditch efforts of U.S. imperialist warlikers who dropped 
germ bombs to cut off the supply route to the front and 
threatened to use A-bombs, while engaging in massive bombings 
everyday behind the scene of the ceasefire talks. It also gives 
a truthful picture of the heroic battles of the brave People's 
Army soldiers on the hill 351 who remained loyal to the party 
and the leader, the country and the people. 
  The novel lastly gives scenes of the U.S. imperialists 
signing the Armistice Agreement at Panmunjom in recognition of 
their defeat and of a grand military parade held in Pyongyang in 
celebration of the victory in the war.

in Korea was started in April, 1974. 
  Now, more than 211,080 sports circles are operating at the 
senior middle schools and primary schools across the country, 
involving over 520,000 students. 
  Schools make students acquire more than one sports 
techniques 
through circle activities and contribute to the development of 
the nation's sports techniques as a whole. 
  Many reserve sportsmen and women of the country come from 
among them. More than 29,650 athletes from sports circles have 
been registered as reserve players of the country over the past 
20 years. Yi Pun-hui, Yu Sun-pok, Chu Chong-chol, Pae Kil-su and 
Song Hwa-son, people's sportsmen and people's sportswomen widely 
known to the world's sports circles, also went through sports 
circle courses. 
  The Taejong senior middle school in Singye County, North 
Hwanghae Province, briskly conducting sports circle activities, 
has annually won 15 gold medals on an average in various events 
including the basketball game in the past. 
  The sports circle of the Nanam senior middle school in 
Chongjin city, North Hamgyong Province, has set an example 
nationwide in gymnastic dance. The school has bagged over 500 
gold medals in many sports festivals and games. And it has 
produced more than 400 fine rhythmic gymnasts in this course. 
  In the process of the popularization of school sports more 
than 560 schools have won the title of model sports school, and 
342 sports circles the title of model sports circles nationwide.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- Camping of school 
children for this year began some time ago at the camps in Korea. 
  Now the campers are consolidating the knowledge they have 
acquired at the school they are training their body and mind 
through diverse study sessions and discussions, sports and 
amusement games, art circle activities, etc. 
  The state is directing big efforts to education of school 
children through extramural activities. New modernly-equipped 
centres for extramural education have been built in different 
parts of the country to provide better conditions for these 
activities of school children. Last year, the international 
children's camp was built at the Songdowon seabeach, a scenic 
place on the east coast, and 54 school children's houses built 
across the country. 
  The Songdowon international children's camp with a total 
floor space of more than 40,000 square metres can accommodate 
over 1,200 children at a time. It comprises peculiar-shaped 
camping houses, the international friendship children's hall, an 
outdoor wading pool, an outdoor funfair and so on. The 
international friendship children's hall is equipped with all 
facilities of the highest level which can ensure diverse sports 
and cultural amusement activities of campers, including a 
1,200-seat theatre, an electronic amusement room, a table-tennis 
hall, a room for the dissemination of knowledge of 
mountaineering and maritime activities. 
  Newly-built school children's houses also are provided with 
sufficient conditions for the education of children including 
various kinds of circle rooms, theatres and sports facilities. 
  At present, there are one hundred and scores of children's 
palaces, children's houses and children's union camps in 
Pyongyang and local cities and scenic places. 
  These places of extramural education serve as centres for 
fully preparing the school children mentally, morally and 
physically. Here they briskly conduct colorful extramural 
activities according to their tastes and aptitudes. 
  After school, children go to circle rooms arranged at the 
palaces, houses and schools to acquire general knowledge of 
basic sciences and consolidate their knowledge of sports 
techniques, music, dance and fine art.

  [Text] On 30 April, Iranian President Akbar H. Rafsanjani 
hosted a banquet in honor of President Le Duc Anh and his 
entourage in Tehran. 
  In his speech at the banquet, President Rafsanjani stressed: 
The Iranian people understand and admire the Vietnamese people 
for their protracted and arduous struggle in the past. It 
serves as a good example for the Iranian people. Indeed, the 
Vietnamese people's determination and victory have greatly 
encouraged other nations to continue their struggle. Vietnam 
has won admiration and respect from countries throughout the 
world. Today, like other nations, Iran highly appraises the 
Vietnamese leaders' intelligence and creativity in carrying out 
the national reconstruction program and in implementing the 
renovation process. 
  We are convinced that Vietnam will continue to score ever 
greater achievements. People in Third World countries have 
taken Vietnam as a good example. I am convinced that through 
cooperation in various fields, we will be able to strengthen 
bilateral relations to meet the aspirations of our two peoples. 
  The current visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran by the 
Vietnamese delegation will create a favorable condition for 
further exchanges of experiences and views. I believe that if 
we do not enhance our cooperation, best results will not be 
attained in collaboration between the South-South and Third 
World countries. 
  Following President Rafsanjani's speech, President Le Duc 
Anh 
delivered a reply statement.

  [Text] Washington, May 2 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States reconfirmed Monday [2 May] that they will continue to 
seek a negotiated solution to the controversy over North Korea's 
alleged nuclear weapons program "if at all possible," Japanese 
officials said. 
  In working-level defense talks at the Pentagon, Japan 
pledged 
to "fulfill its responsibilities within the constraints of the 
constitution" should the United Nations take measures such as 
economic sanctions to enforce its demand for full inspections of 
North Korean nuclear facilities. 
  Concerning the North Korean nuclear issue, Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata's minority government plans to stick to the 
policies of the coalition under former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, Japanese defense officials told their U.S. 
counterparts. 
  Pentagon officials expressed concern over the standoff 
between Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA), which has been demanding unhampered access to nuclear 
sites, including a radiochemistry laboratory, believed to be 
part of a covert weapon program. 
  They also pointed to the "extremely important" role of 
China, 
North Korea's traditional ally, in efforts to find a peaceful 
solution to the controversy. 
  Washington again raised its request for Japanese 
participation in its Theater Missile Defense (TMD) scheme, a 
scaled-down version of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan's 
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), but the Japanese delegation 
remained noncommittal. 
  They did, however, promise to "study" the proposal, 
including 
its "cost-effectiveness." 
  The U.S. officials also urged the quick conclusion of an 
agreement that would facilitate swapping material such as fuel 
and services between the U.S. forces stationed in Japan and the 
Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF). 
  Such an agreement would also benefit the SDF in future 
United 
Nations-led peacekeeping operations, the U.S. officials said, 
according to the Japanese officials.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- Japan pledged Tuesday [3 May] 
to provide Egypt a total of 3.97 billion yen in grant-in-aid to 
cooperate in its projects to repair a tunnel and to improve 
medical services, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  Japan's new Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, who is on a 
four- 
nation Middle East tour, exchanged documents on the Japanese 
assistance in Cairo with Egypt's Minister for International 
Cooperation Yusuf Butrus-Ghali, the ministry said. 
  The aid consists of up to 3.06 billion yen to cooperate in 
Egypt's project to rehabilitate the Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel [spelling 
as received] linking mainland Egypt and Sinai Peninsula, and 913 
million yen for a project to improve medical services in the 
hospitals in Upper Nile, it said. 
  The latest aid for the project to rehabilitate the tunnel is 
part of the 7.58 billion yen Japan has already pledged to 
provide over a four-year period beginning 1992, the ministry 
said. 
  The Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel was built in 1983 but its condition 
is 
deteriorating because of the corrosion of concrete, it said. 
  The 913 million yen will be used to purchase basic medical 
equipment for six public hospitals in Luxor city and the Qena 
Governorate, it said.

  [Text] Shan State, Burma -- Reputed drug kingpin Khun Sa 
says he wants his Shan State to become a province of Thailand 
under Their Majesties the King and Queen. 
  Shan State has more to offer Thailand than Burma's central 
government in terms of a developing market, natural resources 
and cheap labour, he told THE NATION. 
  Khun Sa, also known as Chang Si Fu, is leader of the Shan 
Maung Tai Army (MTA). 
  "We the Shan State wish to become a province of Thailand. 
All Shan people have full respect for the Thai monarch and the 
Royal Family. Also we would like to have bilateral trade, the 
way the European Union countries trade among themselves." 
  The people of Shan State, like other Burmese ethnic groups, 
have been fighting for independence from the central Rangoon 
government, which is administered by the military's State Law 
and Order Restoration Council (Slorc). Khun Sa is widely 
reported to be funding his state by trading in heroin, which is 
produced from opium poppies grown throughout the area. 
  Khernsai Jaiyene, a close aide to Khun Sa, said the MTA has 
sent a letter to the King seeking his help in settling the 
problems of minority groups in Burma. 
  "So far, it seems to us that this (the King's help) is the 
only way to end the fighting by the Burmese people struggling 
for independence from the government," said Khernsai. 
  Khun Sa also expressed concern over the planned 
transportation network linking Thailand, Burma, China and Laos. 
He said it would adversely affect his people and his state. 
  "The network has been pushed purely for economic gain, 
without taking into consideration the wants of the people and 
without good management. The Shan State, which covers one third 
of Burmese territory, would be badly affected," he said. 
  According to Khun Sa, the Burmese government wants a leading 
role in the project because it would be an opportunity to 
eliminate the minority ethnic grouping. 
  "The Burmese government will spend money given for the 
project to purchase weapons to fight against our people and 
other ethnic groups," he said. 
  Slorc would make use of the transport system to be built 
under the project as strategic routes to transport men and arms 
to wage war against minorities. 
  Khun Sa said he was referring to two routes, one linking the 
Bumma-China border province of Lua to Keng Tung and to Tachilek 
in Thailand's Chiang Rai province, and to a proposed railway 
linking China and Laos. 
  "The only way the Burmese government will use the project is 
to tackle its domestic political conflicts, and that means more 
suppression of the minorities," he said.

<F P=106> [Li Tung Commentary: "Is Samdech Hun Sen a War-Monger?"] </F>
  [Text] Some pessimists have put all the blame on Samdech 
Hun Sen for the deteriorating military situation in the past two 
weeks by pretending to forget about the danger of the Khmer 
Rouge and by ignoring the Royal Government's policy. 
  Two months ago, through a newspaper in Phnom Penh, a Royal 
Government official charged that there were war-mongers in the 
cabinet. He did not specify who they were, however. It is only 
now that these pessimists have reflected on this accusation and 
pointed at Samdech Hun Sen directly. 
  Why have these people stirred up this matter? It is either 
to break up the internal unity of the Royal Government and thus 
enable the Khmer Rouge to seize control, or to keep the 
government in chaos and instability, while enabling the Khmer 
Rouge to continue their attacks in the outlying areas, and thus 
prolong the current situation. 
  First of all, even if these elements do not know everything, 
they should at least know that the leadership of the Royal 
Government by the first and second prime ministers must be in 
harmony. The prince's first trip as prime minister to hold 
discussions with Khieu Samphan at the beginning of 1991 and the 
recent final decision to eliminate the Khmer Rouge's 
isolationist movement through military means have all been 
agreed upon. These matters have been affirmed by the two prime 
ministers. We must resolutely oppose anyone who is a war-monger 
and attempts to use warfare as a means to stabilize his power. 
  Each battle has its own meaning, aim, and form. If the Royal 
Government did not resist the war waged by the Khmer Rouge which 
had caused great destruction to national property and the lives 
of people, the government would certainly be blamed. The 
government has been blamed, however, by these pessimists for 
carrying out its duty in line with the articles defined in the 
Constitution. This matter is difficult to understand. It will 
be even more difficult to understand if these pessimistic 
elements are in the ranks of the cabinet. 
  Peaceful means is the only way to end the conflict in 
Cambodia. But the Khmer Rouge have rejected the round-table 
meeting. This should serve as clear proof for all, including 
those pessimists, as to who the real war-mongers are; Hun Sen, 
the Royal Government of Cambodia, or the Khmer Rouge?

<F P=106> [By Alice F. Cabotaje] </F>
  [Text] The country is not totally unprepared for a more 
liberal trade environment under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (Gatt). 
  Economic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito said that the 
National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) has made 
initial moves with Congress to amend the necessary laws to 
concur with the principles of the Gatt accord. 
  Gatt members, for instance, will have to rewrite or enact 
national laws that will protect patents, trademarks, copyrights, 
industrial designs and trade secrets. 
  "We are all for the Gatt. The president has given us 
instructions to do the necessary consultations and 
communications on the impact of the Gatt," he told the INQUIRER. 
  Senate Minority Leader Wigberto Tanada earlier expressed 
alarm over the "state of unpreparedness" of the country in light 
of a new trade order under the Gatt. 
  "I have not seen any organized program, written or 
un-written, on how the country can take advantage of the 
so-called liberalization of the global economic order under 
Gatt," he said in a privilege speech. 
  Meantime, the Pambansang Ugnayan ng Mamamayan Laban sa Gatt 
[National Association of Citizens Against Gatt] (Pumalag), an 
anti-Gatt coalition of 12 agricultural sector organizations, 
continued to lobby against the ratification of the accord. 
  "Third World countries are neither technologically nor 
financially equipped to benefit from competing head-on with 
their foreign counterparts," the coalition said in a position 
paper. 
  Citing an Asian Development Bank report, the coalition 
pointed out that the country is bound to gain a minimal 0.5 
percent increase in trade under the Gatt. 
  The Gatt accord, signed 15 April Marrakech, Morocco, calls 
for the cutting of tariffs on industrial products by an average 
of more than one-third. Domestic and export subsidies given to 
agricultural goods will also have to be reduced. 
  Phasing in of these commitments will be over five to 10 
years 
starting 1 July next year. 
  Aside from the Gatt, the Philippines is also set to overhaul 
its tariff system to meet the requirements of the Asean Free 
Trade Agreement (Afta). 
  A number of industries already raised concern about the 
possible impact of a liberalized trade among members of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations. 
  They noted that the country had already reduced a number of 
tariff lines on several import products upon the proddings of 
its major creditors.

  [Text] Deputy Commerce Minister Churin Laksanawisit said 
yesterday the U.S. trade watchdog is expected to keep Thailand 
on its watchlist after the annual revision of the list is 
announced today. 
  Churin said he was not optimistic that the U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) would remove Thailand from all watchlist 
categories, because "the U.S. is likely to wait until the Thai 
parliament passes the third reading of the amended Copyright 
Bill." 
  In response to an earlier report that the USTR had already 
removed Thailand from its priority watchlist (PWL) and moved it 
to the normal watchlist classification, Churin said the 
announcement had not been made. 
  An economic officer at the U.S. Embassy also confirmed that 
the USTR had yet to release an official statement. "I have not 
received any report from Washington," he said. The officer, 
however, noted that the USTR was at any moment expected to 
announce a revision of the countries on its trade watchlist. 
  Thailand last year was removed from the most serious 
classification, the priority foreign country (PFC) status, to 
the lesser PWL after Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon 
assured the USTR that the Thai government would introduce a new 
copyright law soon. The new copyrights bill has yet to come 
into force, pending its third reading in Parliament.

  [Text] In response to a question from a Korean Central 
News Agency reporter regarding the replacement of fuel rods at 
the five-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, a 
spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today gave the following 
answer: 
  In connection with the replacement of fuel rods at the 
five-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, we and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Secretariat recently 
exchanged many telex messages. Under our special position 
[tuksuhan chiwi] in which we temporarily suspended the 
effectuation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT], out of a consistent position to show the 
irreproachability [kyolbaeksong] of our nuclear activities, we 
decided to subject the upcoming replacement of fuel rods to the 
thorough surveillance of the agency. Therefore, we decided to 
allow agency inspectors to observe [iphoe] the replacement of 
fuel rods to verify that the nuclear material is not diverted 
for other, nonpeaceful purposes [tarun pipyonghwajok mokchoge 
yuyong]. 
  The agency's observance activities, which we decided to 
allow, include the observance [kwanchuk] of the replacement of 
fuel rods, containment and surveillance [pongswaewa kamsi] of 
all replaced fuels, and all other contents of inspection 
sufficient enough to ensure the continuity of safeguards 
[tamboui yonsoksongul pojanghanunde chungbunhan sachal 
naeyongduri]. We also immediately issued visas for the five 
inspectors, which the agency requested. As shown, we made all 
possible efforts to prove the transparency [tumyongsong] of our 
nuclear activities even though we are under a special position. 
  Nevertheless, the IAEA Secretariat is now making an 
unreasonable request [pudanghan yongu] to select, preserve, and 
measure [sontaek pogwanhago chukchong] some fuel rods during the 
fuel rod replacement. 
  Saying that it would select and measure fuel rods means that 
it would conduct regular and irregular inspections [chonggi mit 
pijonggi sachal] after ignoring [musi] our special position in 
which we temporarily suspended the withdrawal from the NPT. 
This can in no way be allowed [tojohui hoyongdoelsu opta]. 
  The only inspection activity that we can allow as a 
voluntary 
goodwill measure at present is an inspection purely to ensure 
the continuity of safeguards to prove that the nuclear material 
is not diverted for other purposes in compliance with our 
special position [hyondangyeeso uriga chawonjogin sonuiui 
chochiro hoyonghaejulsu innun sachal hwaltongun uriui tuksu 
chiwie matke haengmunchiri tarunmochoge 
yuyongdoejiannundanungosul hwaginhanun sunsu tamboui yonsoksong 
pojangul wihan sachal ppunida]. 
  Allowing the agency to subject all replaced fuel rods to its 
containment and surveillance and to verify that they are not 
diverted for other purposes is the expression of our greatest 
goodwill [uriui choedaeui sonuiui pyosi]. 
  The IAEA Secretariat, however, is insisting on unfair 
demands, while openly ignoring our special position. This is 
clear proof that the IAEA Secretariat is still treating us with 
prejudice, while using suspicions of us as an excuse and that 
the IAEA's partiality keeps expanding. 
  The IAEA Secretariat, which has in the past fabricated 
inconsistencies by eliminating [word indistinct] samples, this 
time wants to measure selected parts of the fuel rods. This 
proves that it intends to continue to cling to the anti-Republic 
pressure commotion by eventually making new inconsistencies. 
  What cannot be overlooked is that the IAEA Secretariat is 
still not sending an inspection team, even though we have this 
time allowed inspections to ensure the continuity of safeguards 
and the so-called unfinished inspections, which was raised in 
the last inspection conducted in March. 
  This clearly shows that the IAEA Secretariat has been 
pursuing insidious political objectives by raising our nuclear 
issue at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting and the UN Security 
Council. If we allow the measurement of selected parts of the 
fuel rods under such circumstances, the IAEA Secretariat is sure 
to fabricate a new pretext in the anti-Republic pressure 
commotion. We can no longer let the IAEA Secretariat use our 
nuclear issue in the political game. 
  In case the IAEA Secretariat does not accept our reasonable 
proposal and insists on its unfair demands to the end, we cannot 
but replace the fuel rods in accordance with our operation plan. 
  In technical and security aspects, the replacement of the 
fuel rods is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed any more. 
Whether the IAEA inspectors are there to observe or not, the 
spent fuel counter, thermal luminescence detectors, and 
surveillance equipment installed by the IAEA in the experimental 
nuclear power plant are still operational, therefore, our fuel 
rod replacement work will be under thorough IAEA surveillance. 
  We will place all replaced fuel from the fuel rods under 
IAEA 
control and will allow examination when the nuclear issue is 
resolved in a package deal in future DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  In the event the IAEA Secretariat drives the situation to 
extremes, despite our maximum generosity and good intentions, 
correspondingly, we will resolutely counter this [urinun ungdang 
kue tanhohi taechohae nagal kosida]. 
  With the resolution of the nuclear issue now reaching a 
gateway stage [kwanmunjok taemok], the IAEA Secretariat should 
think more deeply.

<F P=106> ["If IAEA Secretariat Refuses To Accept Our Reasonable </F>
Proposal, We Will Have No Other Alternative But To Replace Fuel 
Rod, Spokesman of DPRK Foreign Ministry" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- If the IAEA 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] Secretariat carries the 
situation into the extremities despite our utmost magnanimity 
and good will, we will resolutely counter it, warned a spokesman 
of the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK in his answer to a question 
put by KCNA today concerning the replacement of fuel rod at the 
5-megawatt experimental nuclear power station. 
  He told KCNA the DPRK did not delay the issue of entry visas 
to five inspectors selected by the IAEA side so that they may be 
present at the place of the replacement of fuel rod and verify 
the non-diversion of nuclear material to non-peaceful purposes. 
  This notwithstanding, the IAEA Secretariat is raising an 
unreasonable demand for selecting, preserving and measuring some 
fuel at the time of the replacement of fuel rod, the spokesman 
said, and added: 
  This can never be allowed because it means routine and ad 
hoc 
inspections ignoring the DPRK's unique status following the 
temporary suspension of the effectuation of its declared 
withdrawal from the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]. 
  It is crystal clear that, if we allow the selective 
measurement of the fuel rod, the agency Secretariat will find a 
new pretext for a pressure on the DPRK. 
  If the agency Secretariat refuses to accept our reasonable 
proposal and persists in its unreasonable demand, we will have 
no other alternative but to replace the fuel rod according to 
our operation plan. 
  Whether the IAEA inspectors are present or not, the spent 
fuel rod counter, the thermo-luminescence detector and 
monitoring apparatuses installed by the IAEA at the experimental 
nuclear power station are operating continuously, and this means 
that our replacement of fuel rod is carried out strictly under 
the surveillance of the IAEA. 
  We can no longer allow the IAEA Secretariat to use our 
"nuclear problem" as a political expedient.

  [Text] Berlin, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] sent another letter to North Korea Monday 
urging the communist state to let IAEA experts undertake 
inspections when it changes fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor 
in Yongbyon, sources close to the agency said. Such inspections 
are necessary under the nuclear safeguards agreement, the IAEA 
has reportedly pointed out. 
  The agency sent a second letter after determining that North 
Korea's reply on April 29 to its first letter was 
unsatisfactory. Monday's letter was sent to ascertain North 
Korea's true intentions, the sources said Tuesday. 
  In its reply, Pyongyang told the nuclear watchdog that the 
fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor must be changed soon and 
requested an early dispatch of IAEA inspectors. It made no 
commitment, however, on IAEA requests laid down as conditions 
for the presence of its inspectors at the refueling. North Korea 
only agreed to allow the inspectors to be present when it 
removes spent fuel rods from the reactor. 
  It gave no clear reply to "the IAEA's flexible technical and 
compromising plans" on taking samples in order to determine the 
extent of plutonium extraction and the reactor's operating 
condition. 
  The IAEA, in its initial letter sent early last week, told 
North Korea it was willing to compromise and take random samples 
of the spent rods, seal them and analyze them later. 
  Although the North Koreans themselves suggested that the 
IAEA 
be present during the refueling of the five-megawatt reactor, 
they have failed to make an offer that would allow satisfactory 
inspection activities, the sources said. As a result, the IAEA 
sent the second letter seeking to confirm North Korea's exact 
intentions, they added.

  [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have narrowed their 
differences enough to allow an inspection team to arrive in 
Pyongyang as early as this week, sources here said. 
  A letter sent by the agency Monday is expected to be their 
last communication, and the IAEA inspectors should be able to 
fly to North Korea as soon as Pyongyang responds, they said. 
  The two sides have been wrangling over the scope of the 
inspection of North Korea's 5-megawatt nuclear reactor. 
Scrutinizing the reactor's fuel rods would allow the U.N. 
nuclear watchdog to trace Pyongyang's secretive nuclear weapons 
program and estimate how much plutonium it has. 
  The sources said the IAEA is unlikely to conduct the 
inspections required to trace the program's history. However, 
the agency has compromised by agreeing to let North Korea seal 
the materials under IAEA monitoring for future inspection and 
analysis.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Pak Chong-hyon from Paris] </F>
  [Text] It was reported on 2 May 1994 that North Korea has 
made known to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] its 
intention to accept additional inspections recommended by the UN 
Security Council presidential statement. 
  On 2 May, a high-ranking diplomatic source said: "Last 
weekend, North Korea told the IAEA that it was willing to accept 
additional inspections, including the taking of samples in the 
glove-box area and gamma mappings in the radiochemical 
laboratory, which it had not allowed during last March 
inspections." 
  The source added: "North Korea has clarified the reason for 
this, saying it will accept additional inspections, inasmuch as 
the ROK has recently shown a flexible attitude by withdrawing 
the condition on the exchange of special envoys between the 
North and South--a precondition to the U.S.-North Korean 
high-level talks. The IAEA is discussing measures as to North 
Korea's acceptance of additional inspections."
