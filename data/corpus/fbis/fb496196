<F P=106> [Station commentary: "A Very Difficult Road To Choose"] </F>
  [Text] During the past few weeks, the military situation 
in the western and northwestern parts of the country seemed to 
be murky, thus causing some persons who lack the common sense to 
accuse the Royal Government of provoking war and prolonging the 
Cambodian bloodshed. 
  However, it is known to all that before the Khmer Royal 
Armed 
Forces [KRAF] launched the counterattacks on Anlung Veng, An 
Seh, and Pailin, the Khmer Rouge [KR] had continued to harass 
and attack the KRAF positions everywhere, especially in 
Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Siem Reap, Kompong Thom, Kampot, 
Kompong Speu, and Kompong Chhnang Provinces. Not only have 
these arrogant activities of the Khmer Rouge [KR] caused losses 
to the KRAF, but they have also wreaked untold destruction on 
the lives, property, and food of our people in those areas. 
Thousands of families have become refugees. They have been 
compelled to leave their villages and homes to take refuge in a 
safe area. 
  Moreover, not only has the Khmer Rouge used its bases at 
Anlung Veng, Pailin, and so forth (?for waging war), but it has 
destroyed national property by allowing the foreigners to carry 
out fishing and gem mining activities that have ruined the 
environment, thus seriously affecting the future of the entire 
Cambodian motherland. 
  Concerning the stubborn Khmer Rouge continuing its illegal 
control of a small part of the territory and its military 
activities that affect the lives and property of the population, 
the KRAF and Royal Government have the task and duty to provide 
the people with security and ensure public order in the face of 
the Khmer Rouge's suppression, massacre, and looting. 
  Moreover, in line with Article 3 in Chapter 1 of the 
Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia, which states clearly 
that the Kingdom of Cambodia is an indivisible state, the Royal 
Government has been compelled to take measures to resist the 
Khmer Rouge's offensives and to eliminate their military and 
economic bases. 
  Everyone still remembers well that before making this final 
decision, Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime 
minister, braving all obstacles, made one attempt after another 
to hold a discussion with Khieu Samphan to jointly seek ways to 
end the bloodshed. In addition, the Prince Krompreah's 
colleagues, such as His Excellency [H.E.] Tea Chamrat, H.E. Toan 
Chay, H.E. Veng Sereivut, and Eng Roland, also tried to hold 
secret meetings and negotiations with the Khmer Rouge, such as 
Ho Bunheng, Mak Ben, and [name indistinct], to find an 
appropriate formula for reducing tension and seek a way out. 
  But all these efforts have produced nothing good at all. The 
Khmer Rouge still refuses to accept the cease-fire. It has 
continued to raise the same old issue of Vietnamese being the 
obstacle. 
  During the recent new year's day, Samdech Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen proposed a cease-fire on several 
occasions, but the Khmer Rouge stubbornly rejected it as a trick 
of the Vietnamese and their allies. 
  In the face of this situation, what kind of a position 
should 
the Royal Government take? Should it continue the defense of 
the security, public order, and the people's property, food, and 
land while the Pol Pot clique stubbornly refuses to cease fire, 
resulting in the government being accused by some senseless 
persons and some newspapers as being the warmonger? Or should 
the Royal Government stop its military activities, stop 
defending the territory, security, and the people, and just let 
the Khmer Rouge do anything at will, thus pleasing some persons 
and some newspepers? 
  These are the difficult paths for the government to choose. 
However, the Royal Government, which was born from the people's 
will expressed through the election, can do nothing without the 
support of our people throughout the country. The Royal 
Government cannot do anything that is against the people's will. 
  Concerning this matter, our people, who are the owners of 
the 
country, should make thorough considerations before making any 
decisions. You should not allow yourselves to be misled at the 
instigation of those persons who lack common sense to an extent 
that might cause grave danger to the survival of our motherland. 
  As voters, we should be confident in the leadership of the 
Royal Government, headed by the Prince Krompreah and Samdech Hun 
Sen, which always unconditionally follows our adored king.

<F P=106> ["Today's Comment" column by Thlang Ambal: "To Achieve </F>
Peace War Must Be Waged"] 
  [Text] Not all of the world's wars have been brought to an 
end through negotiations alone. Some countries have concluded 
wars through talks, while others have terminated them through 
war. Vietnam, after 30 years of fighting, finished its war 
through war. In Cambodia, Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan have also 
ended a war through war. 
  The Khmer Rouge [KR] still nurtures the obsolete idea of 
terminating war through war, by which it has previously 
succeeded. This being the case, it does not want to hold talks 
to end the war. 
  Ignorant individuals-cum-politicians that a party picked up 
from a "rubbish bin" claim that peace can only be achieved if 
the Khmer Rouge is included in the Royal Government. 
  We are still optimistic, however, that "if the war is to be 
terminated," the war must be fought. Negotiations should not be 
held at any rate, because holding negotiations is tantamount to 
handing over a sword to the Khmer Rouge. 
  The policy of "negotiating" with the Khmer Rouge could once 
again become a "policy of fleeing the country." 
  Those siding with the Khmer Rouge must go and stay with 
them. 
The Kingdom of Cambodia will not surrender to the Khmer Rouge, 
come hell or high water.

  [Text] His Excellency Sam Rangsi, state minister and 
minister of the economy and finance, said recently that rural 
development is very important to the Royal Government in its 
struggle against the Khmer Rouge. He added that, within the 
next few years, Cambodia will need greatly increased foreign 
funds if it is to fight against acute poverty, corruption, and 
violence. 
  At present, the Royal Government is facing big political and 
economic problems in a country which has lost everything due to 
war. 
  The excellency said that within the next two to three years 
we will need greatly increased foreign funds and more foreign 
experts to help bring Cambodia to normalcy and train its human 
resources. 
  His excellency the state minister said that he wants a 
market 
economy, but at the same time the country also needs the 
monarchy. 
  He said the international donors will help (?and encourage) 
us to build a correct, legal, strong and [word indistinct] 
system. 
  His excellency the minister of the economy and finance also 
said that, in a country in which over 85 percent of the 
population are farmers, the land ownership law is very important 
and peasants should be encouraged to stay in their hometown 
rather than immigrate into the cities or be compelled by poverty 
to join the Khmer Rouge. 
  His excellency stressed that efforts should be made to 
enable 
the people to stay in their hometowns and have enough to feed 
themselves in line with the goal to make Cambodia 
self-sufficient in food. He added that this is the best means 
of defense against the Khmer Rouge.

  [Excerpts] A ceremony was held at the Marble Square in 
Gandar Hewun Park in Loikaw, Kayah State at 0800 to mark the 
return to the legal fold of the Karenni National People's 
Liberation Front [KNPLF] and its surrender of its policy of 
armed struggle, and its cooperation with the government in 
regional development. The ceremony was attended by Lieutenant 
General Khin Nyunt, chairman of the Work Committee for 
Implementation of Border Region and National Races Development 
[WCIBRNRD] and secretary-1 of the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council [SLORC]; Lt. Gen. Kyaw Ba, minister of 
hotels and tourism; Lt. Gen. Thein Win, minister of transport; 
Brigadier General Myo Thant, minister of information; U Khin 
Maung Thein, minister of energy; U Khin Maung Yin, minister of 
construction; Major General Saw Tun, chairman of the Shan State 
Law and Order Restoration Council and commander of the Eastern 
Military Command; Colonel Maung Kyi, chairman of the Kayah State 
Law and Order Restoration Council and commander of the Regional 
Command Headquarters, Loikaw; Col. Kyi Maung, deputy education 
minister; Col. Than Zin, deputy minister of health; Col. Tin 
Hlaing, deputy home minister; U Kyaw Tin, deputy agriculture 
minister; Lt. Col. Pe Nyein, director general of the Office of 
the SLORC; senior departmental officials; members of law and 
order restoration councils from the Kayah State, districts, 
townships; departmental personnel; priests from various 
Christian sects; U Tun Kyaw, leader of the KPLF, and members; 
and local people. [passage omitted on ceremonial proceedings] 
  Speaking at the ceremony, Col. Maung Kyi, chairman of the 
Kayah State Law and Order Restoration Council and commander of 
the Regional Command Headquarters in Loikaw, said today is a 
very auspicious day for the Kayah State as well as the Union of 
Myanmar [Burma] because it marks the return to the legal fold of 
the Kayah State which had decided to give up the policy of armed 
struggle in order to join hands with the government in 
development. He recalled that during his trip to Loikaw and 
Bawlake, SLORC Secretary-1 Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt had invited the 
armed organizations in the jungle to give up the policy of armed 
struggle and return to the legal fold to work with the 
government in regional development. 
  He said after realizing the genuine goodwill of the 
government, the KNPLF has now returned to the legal fold after 
holding many rounds of talks based on mutual friendship, 
respect, and trust. He said there is now a ray of hope for 
peace emerging in the Kayah State. He said national 
reconciliation is an indispensable task for building a peaceful, 
modern, and developed Union of Myanmar. [passage omitted] 
  Continuing, he said although the current situation in the 
country is heading toward stability and progress, it should be 
noted that the country could come under threat any time due to 
internal traitors and foreign neocolonialists. He said people 
in the Kayah State must be happy to see the KNPLF returning to 
the legal fold with the intention of cooperating with the 
Defense Services in unity for the progress of the country. He 
said the entire nation and people should take pride in and 
welcome the event. He said the people are hoping that the 
entire Union would become peaceful and developed if the 
remaining armed organizations in the jungle make similar efforts 
like the KNPLF with mutual understanding. He said all of us 
should take note of the people's aspirations. [passage omitted] 
  In conclusion, he urged the KNPLF to work hand in hand with 
the local people under the leadership of the government in 
implementing regional development projects. 
  Next, U Tun Kyaw, leader of the KNPLF, handed over the list 
of members, weapons, and ammunition to Col. Maung Kyi, chairman 
of the Kayah State Law and Order Restoration Council and 
commander of the Regional Command. 
  Speaking at the ceremony, KNPLF leader U Tun Kyaw said that 
the KPLF gives great importance to the unity and development of 
the national people residing in the Kayah State, and stated its 
desire to remain in the Union through weal and woe and live in 
unity, with mutual respect and assistance among national races. 
He said his organization welcomed the SLORC gesture of warmly 
receiving the armed organizations returning to the legal fold. 
  He noted that our country is a beautiful country which is 
very rich in natural resources. Developments that should have 
taken place, however, did not happen because of the civil war 
which had been waged for over 40 years. He said the time would 
soon come to develop our country into a just and a genuinely 
democratic country with a new outlook and thought. He said the 
time has now come to establish a Union with a full family 
spirit. He said the KNPLF, in accordance with the wishes of the 
people, had responded to the government's invitation by 
returning to the legal fold and giving up its policy of armed 
struggle. The KNPLF shall work hand in hand with the Defense 
Services in safeguarding national sovereignty and independence. 
He said the KNPLF shall give priority to the interests of the 
people and development and progress of the Kayah State. He 
called on the remaining armed organizations to urgently 
contribute to the government peace policy, which had been openly 
declared to the world, and to work jointly for development and 
progress of the nation.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 6 (BERNAMA) -- Malaysia Friday 
urged Russia to adopt a firmer stand to discourage the continued 
Serb aggression on safe havens in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi made the call to the 
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov who called on 
him at his office here. 
  He said Russia's attitude, which appeared to be siding with 
the Serbs, gave them the confidence to press their onslaught on 
the safe havens. 
  The Serbs know that they will escape any action from the 
United Nations because they are backed by big powers like 
Russia, he told reporters after the 90-minute meeting. Panov 
arrived here last Wednesday on a two-day official visit to 
prepare for the official visit by Russia's First Deputy Prime 
Minister Oleg Soskovets to Malaysia in July as well as to 
discuss international issues. 
  His six-man delegation, which included a representative of 
the State Committee on Defence Industries Anatoly G. Brathucin 
[name as received], would also discuss the MiG-29 jet fighter 
deal with Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak. 
  Malaysia is buying 18 of the air superiority aircraft for 
the 
Royal Malaysian Air Force. 
  Abdullah said Malaysia and tiny countries, like members of 
the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), and Non-Aligned 
Movement (NAM), deeply wished that Russia would adopt a fair 
attitude in handling the Bosnia issue. The presence of Russian 
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia adds favouritism for the Serbs 
[words indistinct] and helped the Serbs to (?continue their 
bloody activities against the Bosnians), he added. He said 
Malaysia supported Russian President Boris Yeltsin's proposal 
that an international conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina be held 
as soon as possible to seek a settlement to the conflict in the 
former Yugoslav republic. The conference would [word 
indistinct] the difficulties faced by the UN which was hampered 
by the presence of countries which used their veto to obstruct 
its decision-making on the issue in Bosnia- Herzegovina, he said. 
  Abdullah said he also voiced Malaysia's view that the UN 
Security Council to adopt the preventive defence and diplomacy 
approach in dealing with the Bosnian situation instead of one 
where action was taken only after the commission of aggression 
which resulted in great loss of lives and property. 
  Panov reacted positively to Malaysia's call and promised to 
convey it to Yeltsin and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, according to Abdullah.

  [Text] The government has no intention of canceling its 
purchase of Russian-made MiG-29 fighters even though Russia has 
yet to adopt a clear stand on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. 
Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said this to 
reporters after the inauguration of the building housing UMNO's 
[United Malays National Organization] Pramu Branch in Pekan, 
Pahang. He said Malaysia should maintain its credibility, or 
else other countries will certainly wonder whether future 
decisions will be based on good practices or on some political 
stand. He added that the decision to buy the aircraft stands 
even though Malaysia is not pleased with Russia's position on 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. This is because Malaysia needs to 
modernize its air force and strengthen its ability to defend the 
nation's airspace.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Kelantan People Should Initiate Changes"] </F>
  [Text] Sabah, a backward state with a high rate of 
unemployment under the Sabah United Party, is now given a shot 
in the arm by the National Front [NF] administration. Another 
state that needs a similar treatment is Kelantan, which is now 
under the PAS [Pan Malaysian Islamic Party] administration. 
Press reports about Kelantan in 1993 showed a picture of 
sadness with its people's standard of living declining steadily 
compared to people living in other states. 
  The PAS often claims that it is fighting for the glory of 
Islam, but the party has forgotten the fact that Islam wants its 
followers to make progress instead of being stagnant or 
impoverished. This state of backwardness was revealed when 
Mohamed Rozali Isohak, deputy chief minister of Kelantan, 
recently had to admit that the investment climate in the state 
is not very promising. Along with a low investment level, the 
poverty rate in both the rural and urban areas of the state is 
quite high. 
  In 1993, the poverty rate in Kelantan was 29 percent, while 
the overall nationwide poverty rate was 17.1 percent. Besides, 
without investment projects, it is hard for any state to create 
new jobs. It is worth noting that the unemployment rate in 
Kelantan stands at 7.3 percent compared to the nationwide 
unemployment rate of 5.4 percent. Within the period of two 
years, a total of 23,218 unemployed had registered themselves 
with the Kelantan People's Manpower Office, namely 13,869 in 
1991 and 9,349 in 1992. During the same period, a total of 
6,258 youths migrated to NF-controlled states to seek jobs. 
This was disclosed by Kalthom Omar, director of Kelantan State 
Manpower Office. In fact, the fruits of development enjoyed by 
people throughout the country are not accessible to the majority 
of Kelantan people, except those who have migrated to other 
states. 
  Now it is the time for Kelantan people to rise and forget 
the 
sweet dreams promised by PAS for many years but never delivered 
to them. The Kelantan people are entitled to enjoy the same 
prosperity and blessings given by almighty god to other states 
by changing their backwardness into prosperity and progress. 
  The majority of Kelantan people, especially the younger 
generation, certainly want the NF to rescue them from the 
shackles of backwardness, poverty, and unemployment. Rapid 
development programs initiated by the NF will certainly provide 
a fresh breeze of change for Kelantan. Muslims in that state 
will make progress and continue to receive god's blessings if 
they are not narrow- minded in their practice of Islam. 
Practicing Islam for personal or party interest is considered 
narrow-minded because it only brings backwardness to the people 
and state. An excerpt from the Al-Haj Chapter, Verse 78 says: 
"And strive in his cause as ye ought to strive (with sincerity 
and under discipline). He has chosen you, and has imposed no 
difficulties on you."

  [Text] Malaysia's trade with Japan, which showed a surplus 
of about RM [Malaysian ringgit] 2 billion a year in the 
mid-eighties, has plunged to a deficit of RM16.5 billion last 
year after widening since 1988. 
  The latest external trade figures released by the Department 
of Statistics showed that the deficit grew by 32.6 percent last 
year alone. 
  Exports to Japan in 1993 were worth RM15.729 billion against 
RM13.921 billion in 1992, but imports totalled RM32.229 billion 
against RM26.366 billion in the previous year. 
  The trade gap widened as imports expanded at a faster rate 
of 
22 percent compared with the 12.9 percent growth in exports. 
  Bilateral trade with Japan was in Malaysia's favour in 1987 
when a trade surplus of RM1.906 billion was recorded. 
  The following year, the pattern of trade changed and 
Malaysia 
experienced a deficit of RM805.9 million and since then, the 
trade balance has continued to slide in Japan's favour. 
  In 1989, the trade deficit stood at RM3.817 billion, doubled 
to RM6.480 billion in 1990, and soared to RM11.449 billion the 
following year. 
  This have been attributed mainly to the increase in 
Malaysia's import of capital goods, intermediate goods and 
components, required largely for Japanese investment projects 
here. 
  Mineral fuels and lubricants and crude and inedible 
materials 
were the top two exports until 1993 when it was overtaken by 
machinery and transport equipment. Other major export were 
manufactured goods. 
  In 1988, exports of crude and inedible materials were valued 
at RM3.489 billion and machinery and transport equipment 
amounted to merely RM914.6 million. 
  Last year, machinery and transport equipment emerged as the 
biggest export component with exports worth RM4.613 billion or 
29.1 percent of total exports, followed by mineral fuels and 
lubricant RM4.307 billion (27.3 percent), crude and inedible 
materials RM3.218 billion (20.4 percent), and manufactured goods 
RM1.387 billio] (8.8 percent). 
  Exports of other sector such as food, beverages and tobacco, 
and animal and vegetable oils and fats have also grown since 
1988, but they remained a minor segment of the total export 
volume. 
  The food export bill almost doubled to RM113 million last 
year from RM69 million in 1988. 
  As for imports from Japan, machinery and transport equipment 
has remained the top import item since 1988. Other major 
imports are manufactured goods and chemicals. 
  Machinery and transport equipment amounted to a staggering 
RM21.849 billion or 67.7 percent of total imports last year, and 
manufactured goods were a far second with only RM5.392 billion 
or 16.7 percent, and chemicals 2.026 billion. 
  Motor vehicle imports which fall into the machinery and 
transport equipment category amounted to RM2.696 billion. 
  Apart from Japan, Malaysia's major trading partners in 1993 
were the United States, Singapore, Taiwan, Germany, United 
Kingdom, and South Korea. 
  Surpluses were recorded with the U.S. of RM4.777 billion, 
Singapore RM8.421 billion, UK RM1.435 billion, and South Korea 
RM579 million and with Taiwan RM2.405 billion deficit.

  [Text] It has been learned that China will exercise its 
veto power should the UN Security Council [UNSC] decide on 
sanctions regarding North Korea's nuclear problem. 
  In a meeting with Beijing-based ROK correspondents today [10 
May], a high-ranking official in the Chinese Government said 
that China is making diplomatic efforts, including 
behind-the-scenes contacts, so that dialogue between North Korea 
and the United States is realized before 15 May, the deadline 
for allowing inspections of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. 
  This official, however, stressed that the Chinese Government 
position is that it opposes the use of pressure on North Korea 
as a method of solving the problem. Thus, he strongly suggested 
that China will exercise its veto power when the North Korean 
nuclear problem is referred to the UN Security Council.

  [Text] Washington, May 9 [dateline as received] (YONHAP) -- 
North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
may find a breakthrough in their negotiations this week and a 
team of IAEA inspectors could soon visit the Stalinist state, it 
was reported Monday. 
  There is also a strong possibility of considerable progress 
in talks between North Korea and the United States in New York 
on a third round of high-level dialogue designed to improve 
their relations. 
  North Korea's Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim 
Chong-su, refused to disclose details of the 
Pyongyang-Washington contact in New York on Monday. 
  But he indicated that considerable headway was made when he 
said, "History always moves ahead and (we) always look at 
everything optimistically." 
  Ranking diplomatic sources here said the North Korean 
nuclear 
issue could be referred back to the UN Security Council if 
Pyongyang and the IAEA cannot resolve the question of conducting 
additional inspections by this week. 
  The U.N. Security Council, in a presidential statement, has 
urged Pyongyang to permit additional checks of its nuclear 
facilities before next week. 
  "Since both the United States and North Korea are hoping to 
hold a third round of talks, there is a possibility of finding a 
breakthrough in their negotiations," one source said. 
  The United States and South Korea agreed earlier to resolve 
the North Korean nuclear row through dialogue without having to 
refer it to the Security Council. 
  Seoul and Washington have also reached an understanding that 
Washington will proceed to the next round of talks once North 
Korea shows some flexibility on IAEA inspections. 
  Details of the U.S.-North Korean negotiations are being kept 
secret, but sources said Pyongyang had showed willingness to 
maintain the continuity of nuclear safeguards by allowing the 
IAEA to conduct additional inspections of a key radiochemical 
laboratory and change film in surveillance equipment. 
  But North Korea refused to accept the IAEA request on 
collecting samples from spent fuel rods for later checks. 
Therefore, the two sides could be seeking a compromise on this 
point, the sources said. 
  At Monday's contact in New York, the U.S. side was 
understood 
to have stressed that the Pyongyang-Washington talks could be 
broken off if IAEA inspectors were not present at the changing 
of nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon. 
  The United States asked North Korea to delay changing the 
fuel rods until IAEA inspectors arrive, sources said. 
  The Americans also pressed the IAEA to reopen negotiations 
with North Korea so that it can send an inspection team as soon 
as possible, they said. 
  Monday's contact involved Kenneth Quinones, the State 
Department's North Korea desk officer, and Han Song-yol, a 
counsel at the North Korean Mission to the United Nations.

  [Text] The United States and North Korea held a 
working-level contact in New York early this morning, Korean 
time, and discussed additional inspections [chuga sachal], 
including the inspection related to the replacement of fuel rods. 
  Gary Samore, chief of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Department 
of the State Department, and Kenneth Quinones, the official in 
charge of North Korean affairs, represented the U.S. side, and 
Han Song-yol, counselor at the North Korean UN Mission, and

Korean side at the contact. 
  Today's contact took place for the United States to deliver 
its reply to the 5 May letter from Kang Sok-chu, first vice 
foreign minister of North Korea. The United States reportedly 
notified North Korea that no further dialogue would be possible 
if an International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team 
were not allowed to carry out appropriate inspection activities 
[chokchorhan sachal hwaltong]. However, the United States 
reportedly asked North Korea to quickly reach an agreement with 
the IAEA over technological problems concerning additional 
inspections, hold the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks, and 
resolve the nuclear issue quickly without breaking the UN 
Security Council's tentative deadline of mid-May, thus, strongly 
hinting that it intends to resume working-level talks.

  [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- The Vietnamese Government 
has informed South Korean lawmakers of its official position 
that it opposes North Korea's nuclear development program, the 
chairman of the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National 
Unification Committee said Tuesday. 
  Chairman Chong Chae-mun and five other committee members 
visited Vietnam from May 2-7. Chong, speaking to reporters 
about his tour of the Southeast Asian country, said, "the 
Vietnamese leaders made clear that nuclear weapons should not 
exist on the Korean peninsula and even though Vietnam has a 
communist system like North Korea, it does not support North 
Korea's lines." 
  On the unification issue, Chong quoted Vietnam's leaders as 
saying that South and North Korea will eventually accomplish 
reunification through peaceful dialogue. 
  During their trip the Korean lawmakers met with senior 
Vietnamese leaders, including former Chief Secretary of the 
Communist Party Nguyen Van Linh, House Speaker Nong Duc Manh and 
First Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Khai, and discussed 
expanding economic cooperation, supporting children fathered by 
Koreans, locating Korean soldiers lost during the Vietnam war 
and returning the remains of Korean soldiers. 
  Also visiting Hanoi were Reps. Pak Chong-su and Kim Tong-kun 
of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, Pak Sil and Chin 
Nam-kung of the opposition Democratic Party and independent Yi 
Chong-chan.

  [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- Despite the tension on the 
Korean peninsula created by Pyongyang's suspected nuclear 
weapons program, the volume of inter-Korean 
processing-on-commission trade is rapidly growing, authorities 
said Tuesday. 
  The government authorized businesses to purchase about 
7,223,000 U.S. dollars worth of end products made through 
processing-on-commission from North Korea in the first four 
months of this year, about nine times that of a year earlier or 
1.6 times that recorded in the whole of last year. 
  A government official expected that purchases of 
processing-on-commission goods from North Korea would reach at 
least 20 million dollars by the end of this year. 
  The approval amount for purchasing such goods was the 
monthly 
maximum of 3.1 million dollars in April, rising from 1.81 
million dollars in January, 970,000 dollars in February and 
1,345,000 dollars in March. 
  South Korean businesses' sales of raw and subsidiary 
materials for processing-on-commission to the North also rose. 
  Goverment approval for selling such materials totaled 
4,806,000 dollars in January-April this year, up about 700 
percent from the same period last year. 
  Seoul's approval for total inter-Korean trade including 
other 
kinds of goods increased 11 percent to reach 64,670,000 dollars 
in the four months from a year ago. 
  Inter-Korean processing-on-commission trade includes mainly 
trousers, coats and duck-down jackets, but not high value-added 
clothing including suits. 
  A government official said, "With inter-Korean 
processing-on-commission trade in a stable stage and visits to 
the North having become impossible, South Korean businessmen are 
focusing mainly on processing-on-commission trade." 
  Government permission for purchases of 
processing-on-commission goods amounted to 23,000 dollars in 
1991, 556,000 dollars in 1992 and 4,385,000 dollars last year.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "It Is Not Time To Hasten North-South Economic </F>
Cooperation:] 
  [Text] Some people in business and academic circles 
recently called for separating North-South economic cooperation 
from the nuclear problem for the sake of promoting North-South 
relations. 
  The assertion of the business quarter appears, at first 
sight, to have propriety in logic. First, in the event that the 
labor- intensive light industry of South Korea, whose 
competitive power is falling behind with each passing day, is 
moved to the North or subcontracts with the North Korean side, 
production costs would be drastically reduced. In other words, 
as North Korea has cheap, good-quality, well-trained labor power 
in abundance, it would offer an excellent opportunity to 
revitalize our light industry. In addition, since the price of 
land in North Korea is not burdensome, one's investment of 
capital in North Korea would undoubtedly be successful. 
  Besides, some businessmen in the South believe that when 
they 
expand their enterprises by properly managing their business in 
North Korea, their influence and pressure would certainly help 
the North Korean regime turn to the moderate line from the 
hardline. 
  The theory put forward by the academic circle pertaining to 
the separation of economic cooperation from the nuclear issue 
appears to be emphasizing only the idealistic point of view. In 
other words, since North Korea is suffering a serious food 
shortage, we should seek improved relations with the North by 
starting an agricultural exchange first, thus separating it from 
complex political and security issues. This theory stresses 
that we should also enable the Korea Agricultural Corporation 
and other various farmers' organizations to come forward for 
agricultural cooperation with the North. 
  Another pretext put forward by the academic circle for 
promoting economic cooperation is the urgency in the long- and 
short-range economic development plans of North Korea. 
According to a recent report, research organizations and 
advisory organs in the United States and Japan, not our country, 
received requests from the North Korean Government for working 
out long- and short-range plans for national land development 
and economic development in North Korea. 
  If this report is true, unique, independent plans, which are 
not linked with the South Korean economic structure and land 
utilization situation, would be adopted. As a result, even 
after our nation is reunified, economic division would persist, 
thus hindering the nation from becoming one country in 
actuality. This would cause the people's concern. Therefore, 
the assertion stresses, economic exchange with North Korea 
should be realized even before the nuclear problem is resolved. 
  All these allegations sound reasonable at first glance. 
However, if we evaluate them in a cool-headed manner, we will 
come to realize that these are indeed dangerous and immature. 
There is no change, first of all, in the Kim Il-song 
dictatorship whatsoever, and North Korea is overflowing with the 
so-called chuche idea, stressing that "Korea is one and it is 
under the benevolence of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il." Even if 
our business firms and organizations propose economic 
cooperation, it would not be accepted so easily as we expect. 
This would be possible only through the benevolence of Kim 
Il-song and his son. Thus, our proposal would be reduced to 
merely a "begging." 
  The North Korean regime is attempting to use the 
humanitarian 
standpoint heightened in our side as a weak point. The North 
Korean regime, in an emergency, would apply various restrictions 
to our business firms that advanced to North Korea, and would 
threaten with such disadvantageous restrictions in a bid to use 
them as a negotiation card. 
  What is important is, above all, for our government, while 
maintaining a cooperative system with world nations, to urge the 
North Korean regime to make a change in its policies. However, 
North Korea will not make such change voluntarily. The change 
would be possible only when North Korea hangs out a white flag 
toward the whole world or when internal confusion occurs within 
its system. 
  Therefore, the act of hastening economic cooperation with 
North Korea will only reduce the probability of its change, and 
will not be helpful in achieving reunification.

  [Text] It is reported that the Dialogue for Economic 
Cooperation [DEC] between the ROK and the United States, which 
was established as a result of the ROK-U.S. summit talks of last 
year, will discontinue one year after its formation. 
  DEC, the highest-level trade consultative body to fine-tune 
two countries'views, is now destined to discontinue under the 
circumstances in which innumerable trade issues pending between 
the two countries--such as the lowering of tariffs on foreign 
cars and the protection of intellectual property rights--are 
brought up. As a result, trade friction between the ROK and the 
United States will further deepen. 
  On 8 May, a person in authority at the government said: "DEC 
was established last year with a view to systematically dealing 
with pending economic and trade issues between the ROK and the 
United States, treating it as a matter of policy. But, because 
the United States has been making an item-by-item approach to 
pending trade issues, DEC is in fact becoming good for nothing. 
In this respect, the government is seriously considering 
whether to discontinue DEC." 
  He continued: "The United States, too, is now making clear 
that DEC is unnecessary unless major pending trade issues, 
including intellectual property rights and the lowering of 
tariffs on sausages and foreign cars, are resolved. Therefore, 
it is predicted that DEC will virtually discontinue at the end 
of this June." 
  Presently, in addition to DEC, there are other consultative 
bodies between the ROK and the United States such as the 
ROK-U.S. Economic Consultative Meeting and the ROK-U.S. Trade 
Working-Level Committee.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Pang-hui] </F>
  [Text] The ROK exported armored cars overseas in September 
1993 for the first time. It sold 42 K200 armored cars, made by 
Daewoo Heavy Industries, to Malaysia at $25 million. Modeled 
after the U.S. FMC company's armored personnel carrier, this 
armored car was developed in the early eighties, and served 
Malaysia's peacekeeping troops in Bosnia as a capital armored 
car. 
  The ROK began to export weapons full scale in 1974, but its 
weapon exports were constantly under U.S. Government 
supervision. In 1983, the ROK set its best record in exporting 
weapons to third countries by selling $300 million worth of them 
that year, but since then, arms sales have continued to decline 
so that in the early nineties, the ROK finally stopped selling 
weapons. ROK sale of M16 rifles to Indonesia without prior U.S. 
knowledge put the ROK in a difficult situation with the United 
States in 1983. A bigger incident, however, took place six 
years later in 1989, when the ROK sold some defense industrial 
supplies to Jordan. Despite the ROK's explanation that it sold 
military uniforms, the United States held fast to its view that 
the export item was software-related to precision weapons. This 
incident resulted in a virtual suspension of weapon exports by 
the ROK, which had previously ranked third for ten years among 
in weapons exports by third world countries, including China. 
  The United States is checking ROK weapon exports based on 
legal grounds in the Weapons Export Control Law and the 
regulations on the international transportation of weapons. 
These laws stipulate that the ROK should not sell weapons to a 
third country without the United States' prior approval. 
Although these laws have exceptions, getting prior approval 
from the United States through diplomatic negotiations is very 
complicated and not easy. While ROK national defense industrial 
companies were able to export weapons with U.S. approval during 
the period from 1981 to 1984, they have virtually been suspended 
since 1985. 
  After fundamentally blocking the ROK from selling U.S. 
weapons produced in the ROK to third countries, the United 
States began to curb the ROK's export of weapons produced with 
imported foreign technology or produced in cooperation with 
foreign countries. The United States stipulated in contracts 
with the ROK that the ROK not sell any weapon produced in the 
country to other countries, and this has repressed ROK defense 
industrial exports of not only such basic weapons as M16 and 
various trench mortars, but also the ROK-type K1 tanks and 
155-mm self-propelled guns, which have comparatively high 
competitive strength. 
  To make matters worse, the United States demanded high 
royalty fees for military technology that the ROK defense 
industrial companies introduced unilaterally. At the 21st 
annual ROK-U.S. security consultative meeting held in 1989 after 
tiresome negotiations which began in 1984, the two governments 
agreed to the ROK paying eight percent of the sale price as 
royalty to the United States. 
  Although the ROK Government has asked the United States to 
ease those regulations through various channels, this demand has 
not been met because some U.S. munitions businesses regard ROK 
defense industrial companies as their rivals and because the ROK 
Government imposes dampers. An official with a domestic defense 
industrial company said: "We stopped bringing up this 
bothersome demand in 1990 when ROK weapon exports were virtually 
suspended." 
  The only way out of this situation is to independently 
develop ROK weapons for exports. We were able to export the ROK 
armored cars in 1993 because the localization rate of the item 
was almost 95 percent. However, Mun Chong-in, a political 
science professor at the U.S. University of Kentucky, who is 
well versed in the ROK-U.S. defense industrial cooperation, 
said: "It is highly possible for the United States to raise the 
issue of intellectual property rights in this case, too." That 
is, the United States is likely to demand the protection of 
intellectual property rights for U.S. parts and technology used 
in manufacturing ROK-type armored cars. The imposition of 
restrictions on the ROK's weapons exports to third countries 
seems to be the most difficult issue in cooperation between the 
ROK and the United States in the defense industry field.

  [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam had 
a telephone conversation with Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata Tuesday afternoon to exchange opinions mostly on the recent 
controversial remarks by former Japanese Justice Minister 
Shigeto Nagano. 
  In the telephone talks initiated by Premier Hata, President 
Kim said that Nagano's remarks on Japan's role during World War 
II have shocked and hurt the Korean people. 
  "There should be no recurrence of a similar incident. The 
Japanese cabinet member distorted the history of the past to 
inflict an injury on the Korean people," the president said. 
  The telephone conversation lasted about 20 minutes beginning 
5:15 PM. 
  Prime Minister Hata offered a regret over Nagano's remarks. 
"It is highly regrettable that former Justice Minister Nagano's 
remarks hurt the peoples of Korea and other Asian countries," 
Hata was quoted as saying. 
  Hata especially noted that at a Diet session earlier in the 
day, he regretted Nagano's remarks by saying that his statement 
had brought both sorrows and anger to many people in other Asian 
countries, Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. 
  According to Chu, President Kim stressed that what is 
important in the contemporary age is for South Korea and Japan 
to cooperate with each other closely toward a new history and 
march jointly onward toward common interests and peace in Asia. 
  The Japanese premier said Japan will continue to strive to 
build constructive relations between Japan and other Asian 
countries including South Korea based on a correct insight into 
the past.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The Europeans are playing 
hardball with Korean automakers by threatening to strip them of 
their Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status for car 
imports. 
  The European Union (EU) is reacting sensitively to Korea's 
fast advancement into its market, a Foreign Ministry official 
said Monday. 
  The ACEA (Association of European Automobile Manufacturers) 
recently submitted a recommendation to the European commission 
urging it to lift GSP privileges for Korean car imports. 
  The ACEA, joined by such major European automakers as Fiat 
of 
Italy, Renault of France and Rover of Britain, also asked for an 
anti-dumping investigation of Korean car exporters in the 
recommendation. 
  Korea exported 90,000 cars to Europe last year while 
importing 500 units. The European Union has repeatedly called 
on Seoul to rectify the trade imbalance.

  [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- The Livestock Cooperatives 
Federation has decided to develop pasture lands in China as part 
of its plan to explore livestock resources abroad. 
  As an initial step, the federation sent on Tuesday a 
fact-finding team to the three Northeastern Chinese Provinces -- 
Heilongjiang, Liaoning and Jilin -- to determine the feasibility 
of creating pasture lands there. 
  The team will also sound out the possibility of bringing in 
the 1.5 million tons of corn South Korea introduces from China 
annually for use as livestock feeds, directly from China instead 
of through third countries like Hong Kong as now. 
  Overseas development of pasture lands is needed as there is 
no room to expand pasturage in the country and hay fodder prices 
are higher in Korea than those of grain feeds, a federation 
official said.

  [Text] Those exporting products less than $20,000 will 
not need government permits from the second half of this year. 
At present, approval is granted to those who receive 
irrevocable licenses of credit (L/Cs) less than the same amount 
from foreign buyers. 
  The new step will reduce the financial burden on small and 
medium business by encouraging small-value shipments. 
  This step was featured in a wide range of measures which the 
Ministry of Trade, Energy and Trade announced yesterday to ease 
regulations on trade, factory sites and distribution within the 
year. 
  To expedite trade,the minimum amount for exports or imports 
which is free of government control after approval is given will 
be increased from the current $5,000 to $10,000 from the second 
half of the year as well. 
  The permit system in the issuance of trade licenses without 
any restriction will be changed into a report system, thereby 
freeing small traders from paying commissions. 
  In the meantime, those who export industrial facilities will 
be allowed to secure necessary equipment in the countries 
concerned. 
  The collection of levies on exporters of industrial plants 
will be abolished in order to enhance their international 
competitiveness. 
  Some research equipment whose imports from Japan are banned 
under the pretext of diversifying import sources will be lifted 
to expedite corporate investment in the development of high tech 
and high value-added products. 
  Imports of raw materials for export will be allowed to 
purchase the amount which they apply to the government for. 
  With regards to easing restrictions on the distribution 
industry, the minimum size of a retail or wholesale outlet 
subject to city or provincial approval will be increased from 
the current 1,000 square meters to 3,000 square meters. 
  A negative system will be introduced only to designate 
business sectors whose operation in retail and wholesales shops 
are prohibited. 
  Currently, the size in retail and wholesale outlets which 
are 
permitted for the service sector such as food and financing is 
limited to 50 percent of their total floor space. 
  To remove obstacles to the opening of new wholesale centers, 
the ratio of wholesale against their turnover will be decreased 
from the 100 percent to 70 percent. 
  Those, who enter the wholesale business using rented 
buildings, will be free from the obligation that they should use 
more than 10 percent of their floor space. 
  The minimum floor space of department stores subject to 
government approval for their opening will be raised from the 
1,000 square meters at present to 3,000 square meters. 
  Their owners will be allowed to run 70 percent of the whole 
size compared with the current 100 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japanese and Russian 
governors meeting in Tokyo were at odds Tuesday [10 May] on how 
to refer in a planned joint statement to a long-standing 
territorial dispute over four Russian-held islands off Hokkaido, 
Japanese officials said. Tokyo Gov. Shunichi Suzuki said the 
Japanese delegation wants to incorporate a paragraph on Japan's 
demand for the return of Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the 
Habomai group of islets. 
  However, the Russian delegation refused the request, 
pointing 
to an estimated 8,000 cases of territorial violations by 
Japanese fishing boats near the southern Kurils in 1993 alone. 
  Both sides will study further the wording of the statement, 
Suzuki said. 
  Twelve governors headed by Moscow Gov. Anatoliy Styazhlov 
and 
17 governors and vice governors from Japan are discussing 
measures to expand bilateral trade and other relations at the 
13th conference, which opened earlier in the day and will run 
through Thursday next week. 
  Styazhlov told participants that Russia will have to dispel 
fears about political and social instability if it is to 
convince hesitant Japanese companies to join in exploiting the 
country's rich natural resources.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Damage Done to Thailand Cannot Be Removed by a </F>
Denial of the Charge"] 
  [Text] Thanong Siriprichaphong, Chat Thai Party MP of 
Nakhon Phanom Province, showed his courage when he held a news 
conference on 6 May to deny the U.S. charge that he was involved 
in drug trafficking. By formally denying the charge -- two days 
after it was publicized and became a scandal worldwide, Thanong 
has displayed his sense of responsibility. 
  Yet, Thanong's denial was simply aimed at self-protection 
and 
cannot clear up the damage done to the Thai parliament, which 
represents the entire Thai people. His denial at the news 
conference does not prove that the U.S. charge was unfounded. 
In other words, there is no proof that Thanong's denial was the 
truth. 
  A scandal involving a member of parliament naturally affects 
the image of the whole nation, and, if it is not immediately 
clarified, the charge would leave a scar on the nation -- the 
way it used to be in the past when our leaders never bothered to 
correct the image of the country and let the world look at the 
Thai as untrustworthy people when it came to the question of 
narcotics. 
  As Thais who must share the blame, we therefore call on Mr. 
Thanong, the Chat Thai Party, and the Thai parliament to jointly 
take responsibility in solving this problem. Mr. Thanong, the 
accused, especially must show his spirit and accept U.S. 
inquiries to prove his innocence. In fact, nobody can charge 
him guilty, neither the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency nor the 
Office of the Narcotics Control Board, since there is not enough 
evidence against him. But as a parliamentarian and public 
figure, Mr. Thanong should make a sacrifice by answering the 
U.S. charge to prove his innocence and thus to restore the honor 
to the entire nation. 
  At this stage, we think most of the Thai people still hold 
Mr. Thanong 100 percent innocent. However, when U.S. 
authorities were seriously seeking cooperation from the Thai 
Government to deal with the case, we cannot help having doubts 
about him. Therefore, it is not enough for Mr. Thanong just to 
deny the charge. Also, it will not improve the image of the 
country if we treat it as a political game and use a delaying 
tactic to buy time until the scandal dies down by itself. 
  We think that, under the present situation, Mr. Thanong 
should challenge the U.S. justice and prove his innocence with 
courage and dignity. Mr. Thanong should accept a full 
investigation, instead of pursuing the case against the media 
through his lawyer, since that would not help in clearing up 
Thailand's image.

<F P=106> [Interview with Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Kazuo Ogura </F>
by AERA staffer Toshiaki Miura; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Miura] You have been advocating "restoration of 
Asia" by insisting that we should reconsider Asia as a symbol 
with positive value. Why are you so particular about Asia? 
  [Ogura] Speaking of Asian diplomacy, there is a serious 
misunderstanding in Japanese society: To say "no" to the United 
States means nationalism, and nationalism leads to militarism. 
Such an outdated syllogism goes unchallenged. The reason is 
that the development of Asian diplomacy had been possible only 
within a harsh international situation called a showdown between 
the East and the West. 
  However, the framework of the Cold War has definitely 
collapsed and there is a need for building a new coordinated 
axis. My idea is that there is no need for Japan to follow the 
Asian policies of Europe and the United States; there is no need 
for Japan to assume that its Asian policies should be identical 
to those of Europe and the United States from the very 
beginning, even if its resultant policies happen to be identical 
to theirs. 
  [Miura] There is a view in Europe and the United States that 
Asia is a threat. 
  [Ogura] The view that Asia is a threat has existed for a 
long 
time. That view was politically meaningless when Asia was 
powerless. Now, however, it is whispered about that the economic 
development of Asia is a political threat. The view that Asia 
is a threat is a self-centered way of thinking in Europe and the 
United States that the center of the world exists outside Asia. 
  Europe and the United States should, instead, ask the 
question: Asia occupies an important part in the world; what is 
the problem in Asia in the world context? Moreover, Asia tends 
to be silent about itself, which in a way inflames an 
Asia-threat theory. 
  Japan is said to be faceless, but Asia is more faceless than 
Japan. The international community should take Asia as a 
positive entity and both should work hand in hand, and Asia also 
should be aware of its responsibility commensurate to its power. 
  [Miura] What is the significance of Vietnam in relation to 
Asian diplomacy? 
  [Ogura] Vietnam is typical of Asia. The annual national 
income is extremely low, averaging $200 to $300 per person. 
Vietnam embodies a poor Asia. But its literacy is 85 to 90 
percent. Vietnam also has an aspect of an industrious East 
Asia, as shown by an old woman street vendor reading a communist 
party paper. 
  Moreover, Vietnam fell victim to the invasion of foreign 
countries in its history. At the same time, it was an invader 
of its neighboring counties. The promotion of Japan's diplomacy 
with Vietnam having such various aspects can be a touchstone of 
Japan's new Asian diplomacy. 
  [Miura] If Japan tries to pursue a diplomacy of its own, 
does it not lead to a collision with the United States? 
  [Ogura] Vietnam regards its diplomacy with the United States 
pragmatically, and it will not take a hard line toward the 
United States. Its relationship with the United States will 
rather be determined by U.S. domestic politics and its Asian 
diplomacy. Although it may take time, the relationship between 
the United States and Vietnam will improve. Even if the 
relationship between the United States and Vietnam goes wrong, 
the relationship between Japan and Vietnam will not become 
difficult. 
  [Miura] Will there be Japan-U.S. friction concerning the 
Vietnamese market in the future? 
  [Ogura] I would have preferred that Japan and the United 
States strike at each other violently in a trade war. The thing 
is, although there is a Vietnamese boom in Japan, it has not 
made any investment in Vietnam actually. Japanese businesses 
are cautious; they consider Vietnam's infrastructure and 
legislation to still be inadequate. 
  Furthermore, Japanese businesses have already established 
their world strategy, and even if a new element called Vietnam 
is proposed, it does not fit into their strategy. It will take 
some time before Japanese enterprises go into business in 
Vietnam. 
  Meanwhile, the United States will move briskly once it sets 
its mind on business, because the United States has past 
business experience in the former South Vietnam era. I am 
worried that Vietnam may express its dissatisfaction at Japan's 
inactivity despite its professed Vietnamese boom. 
  [Miura] What kind of role can Japan play in Vietnam? 
  [Ogura] Japan's cooperation with third countries is 
promising. Although it has money, taking Japanese products there 
will be costly due to the stronger yen. It will work better if 
Japan provides funds and leave them to the care of third 
countries. Concerning Vietnam, the United States and France 
have plenty of know-how historically. 
  [Miura] What is your view on the future possibility of 
Vietnam? 
  [Ogura] Human resources are said to be Vietnam's strong 
point. Speaking of human resources, Vietnam's neighbor, China, 
has human resources of more than 1 billion. From the standpoint 
of a business strategy, the question is which human resources 
are superior in quality. 
  After all, the important point is stability and union within 
Vietnam. It depends whether reform policy can be promoted in a 
manner not contradictory to stability and union within Vietnam.

  [Text] The Agency of Industrial Science and Technology 
under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
will start transferring know-how on Japan's quality control 
(total quality management = TQM) to ASEAN nations as part of 
economic cooperation programs. The TQM system, known as an 
efficient way of improving product quality, has made unique 
development in Japan through pan-corporate quality control (QC) 
circle campaigns. Plans of support for individual ASEAN nations 
will be worked out in 1994 and then be put into practice for 
five years from fiscal 1995. 
  Specifically, 1) manuals on quality improvement will be 
prepared; 2) Japanese experts will be sent to the ASEAN nations 
for on-the-job training; 3) foreign students will be invited for 
training in Japan; and 4) seminars will be held. MITI will soon 
start coordinating requests from those nations, and will decide 
how much time should be given to which industrial areas, for 
instance. 
  At a meeting held between the six ASEAN economic ministers 
and then MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai in Singapore last 
October, an agreement was reached on action plans to promote 
industrial development in the ASEAN nations. The action plans 
included "the promotion of industrial standardization and 
quality control for improvement of product quality."

  [Text] The government decided on 6 May to give top 
priority to providing official development assistance (ODA) to 
southern African nations, including Botswana, Mozambique, and 
the Republic of South Africa [RSA], in which an administration 
led by black citizens will be established. This policy, called 
the "New Frontier Program," aims to provide comprehensive 
assistance to southern African nations, which are attracting 
much global interest, so as to improve the economic situation of 
the whole region on the occasion of RSA's achieving the 
historical change from white domination to multiracial 
coexistence. Japan especially aims to stress the expanded 
range of its international contribution, which tends to be 
regarded as "Asian-oriented." 
  Providing ODA to the RSA has been allowed since 1990 only 
for 
the purpose of helping black citizens to become self-reliant. 
However, by the end of 1992, Japan had only provided about 100 
million yen in small-scale grants and technical cooperation. 
  Following the new administration's inauguration, it is 
expected that larger assistance will be needed in the future. 
Therefore, Japan wants to positively extend cooperation in the 
form of loans and other aid on the premise that the OECD's 
Development Assistance Committee will designate RSA as a 
qualified recipient of assistance. 
  With regard to Mozambique, Japan has already decided to 
provide it with full-fledged ODA in the form of bilateral 
assistance, while also participating in UN Peacekeeping 
Operations. Japan is now studying details of the plan. 
Moreover, in light of the establishment of the new 
administration in the RSA, Japan will expand its assistance 
program to cover Botswana, where the Southern African 
Development Community's secretariat is located, so that Japan 
can carry out comprehensive assistance. Japan provided 
Mozambique with about $200 million in bilateral assistance from 
1988 to 1992, and Botswana with about $5 million from 1987 to 
1992.

  [Text] The Australian Wheat Board has been forced to drop 
its estimates for Australian standard white and hard wheat 
during the past two months. It has been triggered by subsidy 
pressures from market competitors such as the United States. 
  The board now estimates wheat delivered to the 1993-94 pools 
will return between $2 and 3 less than last year. Australian 
Wheat Board managing director, John Lawrenson, said the United 
States subsidy is hurting Australian sales program.

  [Text] Vietnam's prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, said his 
country is ready for the restoration of full diplomatic 
relations with the United States at any time. Speaking to Radio 
Australia's Hanoi correspondent, Christopher Kramer, Mr. Kiet 
said normalized relations would be in the interests of not only 
the two countries, but the entire region. He said full 
diplomatic ties were inevitable. 
  Mr. Kiet committed his government to continuing political 
reforms, which, he said, paved the way for economic reforms. 
But asked if Vietnam was moving toward a multiparty democracy, 
Mr. Kiet said the question was never raised because the priority 
was to make the country rich and build a civilized society.

  [Text] The Philippines has renewed its call to set aside 
sovereignty issues and work instead for cooperation in 
developing the Spratly Islands, following renewed tension 
between China and Vietnam triggered by China's go-signal for an 
American firm to explore for oil in the disputed area. 
  "We are concerned over developments that tend to disrupt the 
equilibrium in the region. But we hope that China and Vietnam 
can resolve this amicably, and later all claimants can proceed 
multilaterally on the issue," Foreign Affairs Undersecretary 
Rodolfo Severino said. 
  "Although this is a bilateral problem, but since its impact 
has reverberations in the region, then all claimants have an 
interest in what happens," Severino added. 
  The latest row between China and Vietnam, two of the six 
claimants to the Spratly Islands, stemmed from China's grant of 
oil exploration rights to the Colorado-based Crestone Energy 
Corp. over a 25,000 square kilometer area of the South China 
Sea, which Vietnam claimed was within its continental shelf. 
  Vietnam warned that Crestone's decision to proceed with its 
exploration of the disputed area was a "serious violation of 
Vietnam's sovereignty" and would escalate tensions in the region. 
  Vietnam, apparently in retaliation, also signed up with 
Mobil 
Oil Corp. to explore an area overlapping the Crestone concession. 
  The Department of Foreign Affairs [DFA] said that while the 
Crestone concession does not fall within the territorial claim 
of the Philippines in the South China Sea, it is closely 
monitoring developments in the area to review its implications 
on regional stability. 
  "As defined by Presidential Decree 1596, the Crestone 
exploration block is not covered by the Philippines' claim to 
the Spratlys. The Crestone block lies some 135 kilometers from 
the Western boundary of the Philippine claim," a DFA official 
said. 
  But the Philippines reminded China and Vietnam of the 1992 
ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea which urged 
claimant-states "to set aside issues of sovereignty and explore 
the possibility of cooperation" in the Spratlys. 
  The official said the Philippine strategy was to initiate 
bilateral talks with other claimants to the Spratlys to promote 
the idea of demilitarizing the area and developing the oil-rich 
islands through cooperation. The Philippines first proposed the 
plan of demilitarizing the area during President Ramos' state 
visit to Vietnam. 
  The Philippines will also continue diplomatic initiatives to 
adopt confidence-building measures which will "veer away from 
military confrontation," the official said. 
  The oil-rich Spratlys is being claimed in whole or in part 
by 
the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Brunei, Taiwan, and Malaysia.

<F P=106> [Telegram from Khieu Samphan to King Norodom Sihanouk; dated </F>
9 May -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] On 9 May, His Excellency Khieu Samphan, head of the 
Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], sent another telegram to 
His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk, stressing the PDK's position 
on the roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation. 
Here is the content of the telegram: 
  Prompted by the spirit of genuine national reconciliation 
and 
unity to which the PDK has all along adhered, I would like to 
inform Your Majesty that the PDK is happy and ready to attend 
the roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation 
under the lofty chairmanship of Your Majesty in the (Kiang 
Si-un) Palace [near Pyongyang]. In case this palace is not 
convenient, the roundtable may be held at another neutral site. 
  I still believe that a roundtable is the first step for all 
Cambodian factions to meet and have discussions so that they can 
gradually agree upon and move toward an accommodation with the 
aim of achieving national reconciliation under the shade of the 
king and the throne. 
  Moreover, I have raised the issue of a neutral site with the 
sole aim of ensuring security and providing equal conditions for 
all parties attending the meeting. 
  All of this is to enable the roundtable meeting to be held 
successfully in line with Your Majesty's desire and the profound 
aspirations of our nation and every Cambodian in the 
countryside, in Phnom Penh, and abroad who desires to achieve 
the national reconciliation and unity of all forces under the 
leadership of the king, thus enabling Cambodia to enjoy peace, 
national unity, and territorial integrity. 
  Availing myself of this occasion, I would like to inform 
Your 
Majesty that I accept this new initiative for the participation 
of the PDK in the government and the Army, and the preparation 
of the election suggested by Your Majesty on 7 May 1994.

<F P=106> [From Azman Ujang] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 7 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- President Bill 
Clinton spoke Saturday of a dilemma facing the United States 
over Bosnia, including the collapse of the United Nations 
mission in the war-torn country if the U.S. unilaterally opted 
for tougher action to resolve the conflict there. 
  Declaring that he had, since taking office, been in favour 
of 
lifting the arms embargo imposed by the UN, he said the danger 
in this was that it could lead to the collapse of the UN mission 
in Bosnia as other countries in the mission would pull out from 
Bosnia. 
  Clinton, at a meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed at the White House here Friday, also sought 
advice on resolving the Bosnian and other issues. 
  Malaysia's permanent representative to the UN, Razali 
Ismail, 
who also attended the meeting, cited Clinton as saying the U.S. 
could still supply the Bosnians with types of arms not bound by 
the embargo but this was bound to be resisted by other member 
countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) as 
well as Russia. 
  But Clinton assured Dr. Mahathir that the United States 
would 
continue to press for the lifting of the arms embargo at the UN, 
Razali told Malaysian journalists after the meeting. 
  On this, Dr. Mahathir advised Clinton to persuade NATO 
members like France and Britain to agree to the lifting of the 
arms embargo which had placed the Bosnians in a defenceless 
position against Serb aggression. 
  Dr. Mahathir said he could not accept the present UN 
helplessness over the Bosnian conflict and suggested that 
countries which wanted to pull out from the UN mission could do 
so to enable troops of other countries willing to help Bosnia to 
take their place. 
  The bottom line is that if the UN cannot guarantee the 
survival of Bosnia, then it should be allowed to defend itself 
as provided for under Article 51 of the UN Charter, he said. 
  Clinton also sought Dr. Mahathir's advice on how the U.S. 
could establish a credible partnership with countries of Asia 
while assuring the prime minister that it was not his policy to 
try to dominate. 
  The U.S. is looking for a partnership without dominance and 
asked how this could be effectualised, Razali said. 
  One advice Dr. Mahathir gave was that countries like 
Malaysia 
could accept criticisms and what was perceived as right or wrong 
as much as Malaysia had never hesitated to say what was right or 
wrong [as received]. 
  Razali said Dr. Mahathir, however, drew a line between 
criticisms and arm-twisting. If coutries went beyond criticisms 
in order to force others to bow to their demand, then they were 
arm-twisting and this was unacceptable. 
  He cautioned the U.S. president about such tendencies in 
Asian countries which are culturally very developed societies 
and which are resilent and their natural forces should be 
allowed to evolve towards their desired objectives, he added. 
  Summing up the meeting, Razali said: It was not one of those 
superficial meetings and it was noticeable that President 
Clinton took a lot of trouble to explain to Dr. Mahathir the 
various aspects of his policies and, significantly, listened a 
lot to what the prime minister had to say and sought his advice 
on many issues. 
  This would create better understanding on how each country 
looked at issues between themselves and the U.S. president 
showed overwhelming sincerity in wanting to improve U.S. 
relations with Malaysia, he said. 
  Razali said Clinton and Dr. Mahathir also spoke about 
reforms 
within the UN in the context of peacekeeping missions. It was 
agreed that both the U.S. and Malaysia would initiatite these 
reforms, he added.

  [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- China has advised North 
Korea not to change the fuel rods at its Yongbyon reactor 
without International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) supervision, a 
well-informed source here said Tuesday. 
  The Seoul government had asked Beijing to use its influence 
in the matter, the source said, but North Korea's response was 
not known. 
  Chinese Ambassador to Seoul Zhang Tingyan notified South 
Korean Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong that Beijing has 
asked Pyongyang not to replace the fuel rods at its 5-megawatt 
reactor in Yongbyon without IAEA supervision, the source said. 
  North Korea has defied IAEA demands to be present during the 
refueling and to take samples of the spent rods, which could 
help the agency trace Pyongyang's nuclear activities since 1987 
when the reactor is believed to have started operating. 
  The agency has threatened to report North Korea to the UN 
Security Council unless these demands are met. 
  Pyongyang offered May 6 to let the IAEA be present when the 
fuel rods are changed but would not allow the collection of any 
samples that might reveal past operations. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Hong asked the Chinese ambassador to 
use his influence with North Korea about a week ago, the source 
said.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Rimpac Joint Manoeuvres" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- If the United States, 
Japan and the South Korean puppets continue aggravating the 
situation by such military exercises as Rimpac, they will invite 
a bitterer condemnation as wreckers of stability and peace in 
the Asia-Pacific region, warns NODONG SINMUN in a commentary 
today. 
  In the manoeuvres due from the end of May to the end of June 
in the Pacific, United States intends to tie Japan and the South 
Korean puppets tighter to its war chariot and use them for 
attaining its dominationist aim, the analyst says, and goes on: 
  It must not go unnoticed that the timetable of the 
manoeuvres 
was announced at a time when the United States, Japan and the 
South Korean puppets were bringing the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain over the "nuclear 
issue" of the DPRK. 
  The United States is now beefing up its forces in South 
Korea, crying for "military counteraction" against the DPRK, 
Japan is intensifying the anti-DPRK campaign, calling for the 
enactment of "a law on the case of emergency" on the Korean 
peninsula and the South Korean puppets are seeking military 
adventures after making public what they call "new operational 
plan". 
  It is a logical conclusion that the Rimpac joint military 
exercises projected by the United States, Japan and South Korea 
will be targeted against the DPRK. 
  The manoeuvres will result in a more strained situation in 
the Asia-Pacific region. Trying to frighten our republic with 
the demonstration of force is a dream of an idiot.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "What Is the War Commotion </F>
Aimed At?"] 
  [Text] From 9 May, the treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique 
once again launched another large-scale war exercise for the 
first half of this year called the joint strategic exercise 
through the puppet's army, navy, and air force. 
  In an announcement by the puppets, the provocative war 
exercise -- which is being held through a three-dimensional 
military operation on the ground, air, and sea with an exercise 
to prepare for action, a biological and radiological warfare 
exercise, the transfer of military forces and equipment, and the 
exercise of taking off and landing on an emergency airstrip in 
the northern area of Kyonggi Province near the Military 
Demarcation Line, in South Kyongsang Province, and on the West 
Sea of South Korea -- will continue until 14 May. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is babbling about someone's 
nonexistent surprise attack and has once again started to play 
with fire. This once again reveals their bellicose nature of 
clinging only to the road of confrontation and war. 
  Someone's surprise attack which the puppets are babbling 
about, is a [word indistinct] of threat to invade the South 
which has not been carried out before. This is nothing but a 
sophistry to justify the criminal character of the war exercise 
which they are carrying out. 
  A very grave situation is being created at this time on the 
Korean peninsula because of the reckless war commotion by the 
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets. As everyone 
knows, under the groundless excuse of the so-called development 
of nuclear weapons, the U.S. imperialists ruptured the third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks. They indiscriminately made bellicose 
absurd remarks by saying that they will not decline to carry out 
a war, and are concentrating aggressive forces into South Korea 
and its neighboring area on a large scale . 
  The offensive helicopter, the Apache, and the new-type 
missile, the Patriot, were dragged in by the U.S. imperialists. 
They are trying to newly deploy military equipment including 
tanks, howitzers, and a vehicle that can fire successive 
rockets, into South Korea. 
  Recently, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry flew into South Korea 
and held secret talks on war, examined preparations for a war, 
and babbled about resuming the Team Spirit nuclear war exercise. 
Along with this, the puppet clique made an order to all of the 
puppet forces to be on 24 hour alert, and are all the more 
kicking up a war frenzy. 
  As shown by facts, there are only threats of northward 
invasion on the Korean peninsula. Despite this, the Kim 
Yong-sam clique is now conducting a joint tactical exercise of 
the puppet army, navy, and air force. This war exercise is 
aimed at making every preparation for assuming an adventurous 
offensive position to invade the North and at aggravating 
tensions. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group also pursues the hidden purpose to 
overcome the serious power crisis [simgakhan tongchi wigi] by 
carrying out this war exercise. 
  As everyone knows, there are loud voices in South Korea 
protesting the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group that is running 
toward the road of fascism, nation-selling, confrontation, and 
war. In particular, with great indignation with the opening of 
the rice and weapon markets to the U.S. masters, South Korean 
people, youth, and students hold demonstrations and meetings 
every day under the slogan "Down With Kim Yong-sam." 
  Youth and students are also intensifying the antiwar and 
antigovernment struggle with the violent death of student Chang 
Tok-su who was forced to join a war exercise as a momentum, and 
the puppets have been driven into a corner. Thus, the Kim 
Yong-sam group tries to turn people's attention, to overcome the 
worsened power crisis, and to justify its confrontation and war 
policy by conducting the large-scale war exercise. 
  This is well proved by the fact that many homeland reserve 
troops have been mobilized in this war exercise. The war 
commotion, however, is nothing more than a desperate struggle 
[majimak parak] by those who have no future. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet regime that has been abandoned by 
the 
people as it turned its back on the nation cannot last long. 
The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to seek a breakthrough by 
stirring up a worthless war commotion. However, the war 
commotion will rather face greater protest and opposition from 
the South Korean people and will only result in hastening its 
ruin.

<F P=106> ["Unpardonable Treacherous Act" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets 
at "a unification and security policy coordinating meeting" 
charged the North with "delaying the settlement of the nuclear 
issue" and claimed that "sanctions of the UN Security Council 
are inevitable" and that "the international cooperation system 
should be strengthened to redouble pressure on the North." 
  This is criticized by NODONG SINMUN today as an unpardonable 
treacherous act. 
  The news analyst says: 
  We decided to allow inspectors of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to be present at the forthcoming 
replacement of fuel rod at the five-megawatt experimental 
nuclear power station and promptly issued entry visas to the 
five inspectors designated by the IAEA. 
  This notwithstanding, the IAEA Secretariat has not sent 
inspectors to the DPRK, raising an unreasonable demand. This is 
motivated by its sinister political scheme ignoring the unique 
status of the DPRK. 
  If the South Korean authorities truly want a solution to the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula for the sake of the 
nation, they must reject the unreasonable demand of the IAEA 
Secretariat and do things helpful to the creation of an 
opportunity to find a fundamental solution to the nuclear issue. 
But, they are now anxious to do harm to fellow countrymen in 
conspiracy with outside forces. What anti-communist fanatics 
they are. Outcries for "sanctions" against fellow countrymen 
can be let out only by foolish traitors. 
  It must not be overlooked that at the meeting the puppets 
recklessly tried to decry the North-proposed peace negotiations 
with the United States for the establishment of a new peace 
arrangement that will take the place of the present armistice 
mechanism. 
  By imprudently vilifying the North-proposed peace 
negotiations, the puppets, who are neither a signatory to the 
armistice agreement nor have the military prerogative, further 
revealed their dislike of the establishment of a new peace 
arrangement and their sinister intention for division and 
confrontation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The South Korean Puppets' </F>
Maneuver To Develop Nuclear Weapons Has Reached a Grave Stage"] 
  [Text] Realizing denuclearization on the Korean peninsula 
today is a consistent demand of the people at home and abroad. 
Denuclearization in Northeast Asia cannot be realized if the 
Korean peninsula does not become a nuclear-free zone, and if 
Northeast Asia does not realize denuclearization, we cannot 
expect peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. 
  Therefore, realizing the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula is a grave task of the times. Nevertheless, while 
running counter to the intention and demand of the times, the 
South Korean puppets today are conspiring with outside forces to 
all the more heatedly develop nuclear weapons. 
  A concrete example of this is the fact that the South Korean 
puppets are promoting to develop a fast-breeder reactor. A 
fast-breeder reactor is an atomic reactor that produces 
high-purity plutonium, which is raw material for producing 
nuclear weapons. 
  The South Korean puppets have promoted the development of 
the 
fast-breeder reactor since a long time ago. Since the 1980's 
the South Korean puppets had started the development of the 
fast-breeder reactor and it has currently reached a very grave 
stage. In 1984, the South Korean puppets concluded an agreement 
with a European country, which possesses the most advanced 
technology in the world in developing the fast-breeder reactor, 
to introduce the high-breeder reactor. It thus started to 
introduce its core technology, design, and experimental reactor 
facilities. In the late 1980's, it completed various 
technological preparations and experiments necessary to develop 
positive reactors. Also in the 1990's, after going through the 
experimental stage, it started to develop it on a full-scale. 
  According to nuclear experts, the conceptional and budgetary 
design of the positive reactors has already been completed in 
South Korea, and the overall amount that has been invested is 
118.3 billion won. 
  Currently, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is receiving 
support and recognition from the world's social circles on 
developing the fast-breeder reactor, and is carrying out 
diplomatic activities by bustling about here and there to 
demonstrate a legitimate justification. 
  The puppets are not only all the more producing plutonium 
within South Korea, but they are also bringing more of it in 
from other countries and are appropriately maintaining the 
production process itself to reprocess it. 
  The so-called chairman of the Foreign Affairs and 
Unification 
Committee of the South Korea National Assembly said that we 
cannot transfer other countries' nuclear fuel. This clearly 
shows how much the South Korean puppets are persistently 
clinging to nuclear development. 
  Regardless of all the facts, in an interview with THE LOS 
ANGELES TIMES, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that they do not have 
any intention at all to independently develop nuclear weapons. 
This is a poor excuse to avoid criticism from the world 
community, which is leaning toward them. This shows how much he 
is filled with falsehood and hypocrisy. 
  Papers of various countries, including the United States and 
Great Britain, view that plutonium already stored by South Korea 
amounts to 10 tonnes and that it will increase to 24 tonnes in 
the year 2000. As such, even though the South Korean puppets 
are acting as the shock brigade for their nuclear development, 
they are trying to mislead the world as if we have some kind of 
a nuclear problem. 
  On 4 May, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that during the past one 
year we have continued nuclear development and that North Korean 
nuclear development must be restrained in whatever way. Such a 
remark by traitor Kim Yong-sam is aimed at completing their goal 
of being armed with nuclear weapons by accelerating the 
development of their nuclear weapons under the protection of the 
U.S. nuclear umbrella by making it so that the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula cannot reach a package settlement at the 
DPRK-U.S. talks in whatever way. 
  Nevertheless, nothing will be gained regardless of how the 
South Korean puppets plot to harm us with the nuclear issue. 
The world's people who treasure justice and truth and love 
peace have a clear insight of the true nature of the scheme 
being carried out by the South Korean puppets. 
  The more the Kim Yong-sam ring accelerates their nuclear 
development by finding fault with our so-called nuclear 
suspicions, the more their true nature will be revealed before 
the world's people. The South Korean puppets must correctly 
know that their reckless maneuver to develop nuclear weapons 
will only bring about a result of digging their own graves. 
They must immediately stop the play of putting the calamity of 
a nuclear disaster on the heads of the fellow countrymen.

<F P=106> ["Nuclear Development in S. Korea Denounced" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Chong Sin-hyok, 
vice-chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland, issued a statement to the press Saturday, in 
which he scathingly denounced the South Korean puppet clique's 
moves to develop nuclear arms as a heinous, anti-national crime 
intended to inflict a nuclear holocaust upon the entire fellow 
countrymen and turn the 3,000-ri national territory into a 
barren land. 
  He charged that the South Korean puppet clique have 
already acquired the capability to make nuclear weapons and 
produced and concealed several nukes in secret. 
  The statement said: 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency, reduced to a maid of 
the United States, has connived at the military nuclear 
facilities in South Korea, not announcing the result of 
investigation of them, while openly taking issue with the DPRK's 
experimental reactor for a peaceful use. This clearly shows 
that the agency is devoid of impartiality. 
  If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat have 
willingness to prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and keep 
peace on the globe, they should, first of all, pay due attention 
to the South Korean puppets' nuclear development on an extremely 
dangerous stage and urgently take an appropriate step against it. 
  The statement earnestly called upon the entire fellow 
countrymen in the North and the South of Korea and overseas to 
actively turn out in the just struggle to check and frustrate 
the South Korean puppet clique's dangerous development of 
nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> ["Shameless Utterances Reversing Black and White" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
at "Chongwadae" [presidential offices] on May 4 blared that the 
North was "engaged in nuclear development" targeted against 
South Korea and that the North was "violating the truce 
agreement, not abandoning its ambition for communization of the 
South". He also slandered the North's recent negotiation 
proposal vis-a-vis the United States to replace the Korean 
Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and establish a new 
peace arrangement. 
  Branding them as shameless remarks reversing black and 
white, 
motivated by an intention to slander and harm the North, a news 
analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: 
  They who are hell bent on moves to plunge the nation into a 
holocaust of nuclear war, acting as a shock brigade of outside 
forces in their "nuclear racket" to isolate and stifle the DPRK, 
are slandering the North over its "nuclear development" and 
"attempt at communizing the South". This is the height of folly. 
  Although more than 40 years have passed since the conclusion 
of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the United States is still 
keeping up its military occupation of South Korea, far from 
withdrawing from there, and has reinforced its aggression 
forces in South Korea and ceaselessly staged new war provocation 
moves against the North together with the South Korean puppets. 
This itself is a flagrant violation of the Armistice Agreement. 
  It is ridiculous and impudent of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, a 
colonial puppet without even the military prerogative, to 
slander and meddle in the North's just negotiation proposal to 
establish a new peace arrangement which will replace the present 
armistice body. 
  In slandering the North, the traitor Kim Yong-sam sought to 
calm down sentiments of the people who turn out in 
anti-American, anti-"government" struggle and thus defuse his 
ever worsening ruling crisis. 
  But the truth cannot be concealed and the miserable end of 
the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is inevitable.

<F P=106> ["Puppet Traitor's Ballad of National Division"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
invited South Korean businessmen to a party Friday and drivelled 
that "fantastic view of reunification should be discarded," 
talking about the fictitious "North's desire to communize the 
South," "manufacturing of nuclear weapons" and the like, 
according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  His jargon is an unpardonable criminal utterance of inciting 
confrontation and disivion between the North and the South and 
an open challenge to the 70 million fellow countrymen ardently 
aspiring after the independent and peaceful reunification of the 
country. 
  His remarks are a ruse to justify the schemes for division 
and confrontation and a desperate attempt to calm down the 
fighting spirit of the South Korean people against him and 
bridge over the catastrophic crisis of the "civilian regime" by 
diverting elsewhere their attention. 
  This time the traitor let out a string of rubbish about 
"harmony between labor and capital," "industrial peace" and so 
on. It is, after all, nothing but a crafty jugglery to hush up 
South Korean workers who have turned out in the struggle for 
their existence, unable to eke out their livelihood any longer 
in the worst living position due to the colonial dependent 
economy. 
  The fact tells that unless the South Korean people 
resolutely 
break with such traitors as Kim Yong-sam, their independent 
demand and democratic rights cannot be guaranteed and the peace 
and peaceful reunification of the country cannot be realized. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam must step down at an early date as 
demanded by the people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Chang Tok-su, a 
third-year student of the business economics course of Sejong 
University in Seoul, was shot on the chest to death while in a 
drill of the "reserve forces" in South Korea some days ago. 
  NODONG SINMUN today criticizes it as another tragedy 
produced 
by the "civilian" regime's war hysterics against the North. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The puppet Defence Ministry described "pressure of his heart

ridiculous sophism to conceal its criminal act in forcing the 
university students to fire live cartridges in a war exercise. 
  Loud voices critical of the "civilian"-veiled war-maniacs 
who 
caused the death by driving students to a war exercise are 
ringing out from South Korea. 
  It is a treacherous act for the Kim Yong-sam group to drive 
out the students as a bullet shield in a war exercise against 
fellow countrymen. 
  The traitorous clique of Kim Yong-sam is staging war 
exercises almost every day, crying out for "tough posture" and 
"military countermove" toward the North. This inflicts 
immeasurable disasters on the people. 
  Unless the racket of North-South confrontation and war is 
stopped in South Korea, the people cannot be freed from

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
Sunday issued its information No. 649 condemning the South 
Korean puppet clique for outrageous suppression of workers' 
strike for wage hike and right to existence. 
  According to the information, the Kim Yong-sam group sent 
combat police to a rally of workers observing May Day to block 
up streets and square. 
  They also kicked up a row of search for the leading forces 
after the rally and arrested scores of people in a few days. 
  "This suppression followed the instructions of traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, who said he would make this year `a year with no 
dispute between labour and management', to take a `strong 
counteraction' by `law' against the workers' strikes, legal or 
illegal, small or big," the information notes, and goes on: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group's clamour for "building of a society 
for workers in a sweat" or "triunity" is a sheer deceptive 
propaganda. 
  South Korean workers, expecting nothing from the Kim 
Yong-sam 
"government", should more vigorously turn out in the struggle 
against the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime to retake the right to 
existence and establish a true democratic government, 
strengthening regional and sectional relations, firmly united 
around an independent, democratic trade union.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Japanese Reactionaries Who </F>
Actively Participate in a U.S. Plot for War Provocation"] 
  [Text] The Japanese reactionaries have recently 
participated in the U.S. plot to regard the Republic as an enemy 
and to crush [apsal] it. As has already been reported, 
Japanese-U.S. military officials concerned recently discussed 
the so-called Japanese-U.S. cooperative system in Tokyo to cope 
with the situation when conflicts break out on the Korean 
peninsula [choson pandoesoui punjaeng palsaenge taeunghan]. 
  Japan's KYODO News Agency reported that Japan and the United 
States considered plans to sign a Japanese-U.S. agreement for 
the supply of military materials in order for the U.S. Forces 
stationed in Japan and the Japanese Self-Defense Army to support 
each other, in areas of munition and fuel, in case of an 
emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. This clearly shows 
that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have openly pursued 
their ambition to invade our country in collusion with each 
other. 
  In particular, what we cannot overlook is that the Japanese 
reactionaries have disclosed their attempt to invade Korea by 
talking about the nuclear development or missile threat by 
someone at the same time when the United States' plot of 
crushing the Republic has been unprecedentedly strengthened. 
They have publicly said that in the event of an emergency 
situation on the Korean peninsula, Japan's dispatch of arms to 
the Korean frontlines and its joint military action with the 
U.S. Forces would be constitutional. 
  According to the Japanese reactionaries' plan to reinvade 
Korea, the basic strike forces of the Japanese Self-Defense Army 
have been mobilized and deployed into the western areas of Japan 
and, thus, are on alert status. 
  The Japanese Self-Defense Army is frequently conducting the 
military exercise geared towards a simulated Korean war [choson 
chonjaengul kasanghan] and the large-scale Japanese-U.S. joint 
military exercise. Furthermore, the Japanese Foreign Ministry 
officials concerned have greatly maintained that in case the 
United States carries out a sea blockade against the DPRK, Japan 
should reorganize the supply service system to participate in it. 
  As disclosed, the Japanese reactionaries have removed 
articles from its constitution that prohibit the exercise of 
collective self-defense rights under the pretext of so-called 
international cooperation, thus availing themselves of an 
opportunity in which tensions on the Korean peninsula are 
aggravated. As a result, they have attempted to achieve their 
hidden ambition for overseas expansion, by more actively 
participating in a U.S. war plot against the Republic. 
  In a 6 April meeting to revise the defense plan, the members 
of the Council of Defense Affairs, an advisory organization to 
the Japanese prime minister, talked about the concrete study of 
joint action which Japan would take with the U.S. Forces 
stationed in Japan under the pretext of our nuclear issue. Even 
the Defense Office has supported it. 
  Regarding this, Japan's YOMIURI SHIMBUM reported on 6 April: 
Japan should take advantage of U.S. war plots to immediately 
formulate a crisis management system [wigikwanri chegye]. Also, 
the paper reported that the Japanese Self-Defense laws and other 
laws concerned should be revised in order to support the U.S. 
Forces in case they carry out the sea blockade against our 
country. 
  Japan's KYODO News Agency reported on 6 April: A Japanese 
Foreign Ministry high-level official said that in case a war 
breaks out on the Korean peninsula, not only the Japanese 
Self-Defense Army's transport planes but also warships [hamson] 
should be mobilized to evacuate the Japanese people from foreign 
countries, including South Korea, and that, for this end, the 
law on Japan's Self Defense Army should be revised as soon as 
possible. Thus, he referred to the emergency situation on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  All these facts show that if the United States were to 
provoke a new war on the Korean peninsula, Japan intends to 
carry out supply service support [hubang chiwon] for the U.S. 
Forces, and that it intends to directly participate in a war 
against our country. 
  The Japanese reactionaries should be hold totally 
responsible 
for the consequences arising from their act of positively 
participating in the U.S. plot for war provocation. Also, they 
should clearly look at the trends of the times and act with 
discretion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The Zimbabwe Association 
of Democratic Lawyers on May 2 published a statement denouncing 
the repression of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan by the Japanese 
authorities. 
  The statement notes that the police of Japan which styles 
itself a law-governed country breaks into lawful Chongnyon 
organisations in broad daylight and commits outrages and 
gangsters, running about in packs, openly commit murder and 
violence against Koreans in Japan. 
  "This is an intolerable infringement upon the human rights 
of 
the Koreans in Japan, legitimate citizens overseas of the DPRK, 
and outrageous acts violating the international law," it notes 
and stresses: 
  "The Japanese authorities must promptly stop suppression of 
Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and apologize for it". 
  It strongly demands that the Japanese authorities give up 
immediately their hostile policy against the DPRK and stop 
forthwith nuclear armament directed against it.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 7 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] -- 
Officials of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan continue their protest 
against suppression by the Japanese police. 
  Officials and compatriots under the Osaka prefectural 
headquarters of Chongnyon on May 4 demanded that the Osaka 
prefectural police apologize for the crackdown on the Chongnyon 
organization at once and return the materials Lhich had been 
confiscated. 
  On the same day, compatriots of the Shibugawa section of the 
South branch of Chongnyon in Higashiosaka joined in the protest, 
led by a streamer inscribed with a slogan denouncing the police. 
  A symposium on the human rights of Koreans in Japan on May 2 
released a letter of protest condemning the repression by the 
Japanese police as a crackdown on the Koreans in Japan and 
violation of their human rights. 
  Branding the police search of Chongnyon as a political 
repression, the letter said such a repressive row itself is an 
expression of national discrimination and chauvinism.

<F P=106> ["Anachronistic Jargon"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The new justice minister 
of the Japanese Government, Shigeto Nagano, contended that "it 
is wrong to say the Pacific War was a war of aggression" and the 
purpose of the war lay in "liberating colonies and establishing 
the greater East Asia coprosperity sphere." 
  Commenting on his remarks, NODONG SINMUN today brands this 
as 
a crude distortion of history and an intolerable insult to the 
Asian peoples who underwent terrible misfortunes and sufferings 
due to the aggression by the Japanese imperialists. 
  The analyst says: 
  Nagano's remarks represent the view of the Hata cabinet on 
the war of aggression in the past and reveal the reactionary and 
aggressive nature of the Japanese Government. And this tells us 
that the Japanese Government has wholly taken over the mode of 
thinking of the predecessors who started the war of aggression 
in the past and it is standing on the extention line of the war 
cabinet of imperialism of the bygone days ideologically and 
mentally. 
  Openly crying for the institution of "A Law on the Case of 
Emergency" almost everyday, the Hata cabinet is trying to easily 
mobilize manpower and material resources in a war of aggression 
by establishing "an emergency system" and a "wartime 
mobilisation system". 
  By attempting to justify the past war of aggression as "a 
war 
of liberation" Nagano sought to establish an ideological and 
political logic favorable for the policy of the militarists 
staging a comeback to Asia. 
  His description of the past war of aggression as "a war of 
justice" for "the greater East Asia coprosperity sphere" 
discloses the wild design of the militarist reactionaries to 
revive the old order of colonial domination in which Japan 
behaved like the master in Asia. 
  It is a shame of the Japanese people that such a fellow as 
Nagano is holding an important post in the Japanese cabinet. 
  If Japan again take the road of aggression and war, failing 
to draw a lesson from its defeat in the past, it will suffer a 
more miserable defeat.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
[C.C.] of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] gave a party on May 
7 for the delegation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) 
on a visit to Korea. 
  Addressing the party, Secretary of the C.C., the WPK Hwang 
Chang-yop highly appreciated the Communist Party of India 
(Marxist) that is positively striving for the freedom and 
emancipation of the Indian people, the peace and security of 
Asia and the rest of the world and the cause of socialism, and 
expressed firm solidarity for it. 
  "The current situation makes it incumbent upon the communist 
and workers' parties to strengthen the bonds of international 
solidarity and collectively confront the anti-socialist 
offensives of the imperialists," he said, adding "the Workers' 
Party of Korea will, in the future, too, direct positive efforts 
to strengthening and developing the bonds of friendship and 
solidarity with the Communist Party of India (Marxist)". 
  Head of the delegation Jyoti Basu, member of the Political 
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India 
(Marxist) and prime minister of the West Bengal State, spoke at 
the party. 
  Noting Korea, a bulwalk of socialism, is the beacon of the 
world working class, he highly estimated the remarkable success 
achieved by the Korean people in the socialist construction 
under the guidance of respected Comrade Kim Il-song, the leader 
of the world communist movement, and the Workers' Party of Korea. 
  Pointing out that the Korean people are advancing under the 
uplifted banner of the chuche idea, he said: 
  Under the leadership of respected Comrade Kim Il-song and 
dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, the Korean people are thoroughly 
applying the principle of independence in politics, 
self-supporting in economy and self-reliance in defence. 
  Friendly and fraternal relations are existing between the 
Workers' Party of Korea and the Communist Party of India 
(Marxist) and the party members of the Communist Party of India 
(Marxist) are in high spirit over the socialism of Korea that is 
making a stride forward. 
  The spearhead of aggression of imperialism is now directed 
to 
socialism, he said, noting any moves of the U.S. imperialists 
can not bring the valiant revolutionaries of Korea to their 
knees. 
  He denounced the U.S. imperialists' unjustifiable pressure 
upon the Korean people with the fabrication of the "nuclear 
issue" and expressed solidarity for the Korean people's 
struggle, stressing that no one can check the advancement of 
people towards socialism.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song received a message of greetings from the 
participants in a Malian joint seminar on the chuche idea and 
education held in Bamako. The message said: 
  President Kim Il-song founded the chuche idea, the idea of 
shaping the destiny of mankind, reflecting the independent 
demand and interest of the popular masses in the first period 
when he set out on the road of revolution and applied it to 
practical activities to build the socialist system centred on 
the popular masses in Korea. 
  The Korean-style socialism where the leader, the party and 
the masses are singleheartedly united gives a hope and courage 
to the world progressive people and clearly indicates the road 
ahead of the third world countries. 
  We extend firm solidarity with the heroic Korean people 
confidently advancing along the road of socialism chosen by 
themselves and express full support to the Korean people in 
their struggle to realize reunification of the country on the 
basis of the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation. 
  The message wished President Kim Il-song good health and a 
long life.

<F P=106> ["Justice Is Sure To Win" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The great victory of the 
people of the former Soviet Union in the patriotic war (May 9, 
1945) was a demonstration of the superiority of the socialist 
system to the capitalist system and its invincible might, says 
NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  The article says: 
  By defeating fascist Germany in the past patriotic war, the 
people and Army of the former Soviet Union defended the 
socialist state, the first of its kind in the world, relieved 
peoples of many countries from the danger of fascist enslavement 
and greatly contributed to the human cause of liberation. 
  After the downfall of international fascism with the end of 
the Second World War, the popular masses, who had been the 
objects of history in the past, have now become the driving 
forces of history, shouldering the cause of independence. 
  But, the old forces of imperialism still remain and they are 
seeking the ambition for domination over the world as ever. 
  They are economically blockading and strangling and 
militarily threatening and crushing the countries that are going 
against them, while fostering national and regional 
contradictions, confrontations and division in different areas 
of the world. 
  The facts show that the aggressive nature of imperialism has 
never been changed and cannot be changed. 
  The obtaining situation requires the people the world over 
to 
unite for an active struggle against imperialism under the 
banner of anti-imperialist independence. 
  Only when the people of the world vigorously conduct the 
peace- defending movement against imperialism and war, will 
imperialism and dominationism become impotent and the people's 
cause of independence and socialism advance.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Delegates of political 
parties and organizations of different countries, who had 
attended the international seminar of revolutionary parties and 
organizations held in Brussels, made public a joint statement on 
May 4 denouncing the U.S. and its allies' moves to isolate and 
stifle Korea and supporting the Korean people's cause of 
national reunification. 
  The statement expressed deep apprehensions of the anti-DPRK 
campaign launched by the United States and its followers to 
isolate and stifle socialist Korea under the pretext of 
fictitious "nuclear suspicion". 
  It favoured the 10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation which indicates a shortcut to Korea's reunification. 
  It demanded that the United States and its followers 
including the International Atomic Energy Agency stop at once 
their anti-DPRK, anti-socialist campaign going against the 
present trend of the world towards peace and justice. 
  It urged the South Korean authorities to send Kim In-so and 
Ham Se-hwan back to the North at once, set free all prisoners of 
conscience and accept the proposal for a convocation of national 
conference advanced by the North to achieve Korea's 
reunification in the 1990s. 
  It called upon political parties, organizations and 
progressive forces the world over to extend solidarity to the 
Workers' Party [WPK] and the people of Korea in their efforts 
for the defence of the socialist gains and for the independent 
and peaceful reunification of the country and conduct an 
international campaign to defend socialist Korea. 
  Meanwhile, the chairman of the Danish Communist Party (M-L), 
the chairman of the Communist Party of Germany, the general 
secretary of the All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, the 
chairman of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the chairman of 
the Workers World Party of the United States, who attended the 
seminar, expressed full support to and solidarity with the WPK 
and the Korean people in their efforts for the building of 
socialism and the independent and peaceful reunification of the 
country, when they met the delegation of the Workers' Party of 
Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, replied to a 
letter from Corporal Kim Chol-chin and Private 1st Class Kim 
Kyong-chol of the Korean People's Security Forces, who came back 
after they fell unconscious, caught in a storm, on the West Sea 
of Korea in January and were detained by the enemy. 
  The autographic reply letter says: 
  "The motherland is proud of such fine sons as you. 
  I firmly believe that you will glorify your life in the 
noble 
cause of defending the party and the country, cherishing the 
precious experience you got in the enemy-controlled area. 
  Kim Chong-il." 
  In their letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il the two soldiers 
said 
it was thanks to the rockfirm faith and will instilled in them 
by General Kim Chong-il and to his loving care that they could 
come back to the bosom of the general, at last, winning the 
fight with the enemy. 
  "With the unshakable faith that we are sure to win as long 
as 
you are with us, dear General, we rose up in confrontation with 
the enemy, firmly determined to come back to you, come to you 
even in death, if we could not come alive," they said. 
  They said the enemy tried to appease them with money and 
honeyed words in an effort to take them off from the bosom of 
General Kim Chong-il, but they kept the faith as his soldiers to 
the end and thus were embraced in his bosom again with honor. 
  "When we saw in the enemy-controlled area the enemy tremble 
for fear of you, dear General, our conviction of certain victory 
grew a hundred, nay, a thousand times, the conviction that our 
general is the greatest in the world and we will win as long as 
there is you, General Kim Chong-il, with us," they said. 
  The two soldiers pledged to remain loyal to General Kim 
Chong-il in whatever storm, even though the world may change 
hundreds of times, and become the first bombs of the 5 million 
bombs in safeguarding him.

<F P=106> ["Having Revolutionary Outlook on the Leader Is Firm </F>
Guarantee for Cherishing Loyalty as One's Faith and Obligation" 
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Since the revolutionary 
cause is the cause of the leader, the revolutionaries can remain 
unfailingly loyal to the leader and struggle undauntedly on the 
revolutionary road only when they have an unshakable 
revolutionary outlook on the leader, stresses NODONG SINMUN in a 
signed article today. 
  The article says: 
  The revolutionary outlook on the leader is the foundation on 
which the revolutionaries cherish loyalty to the leader as their 
revolutionary faith and the ideological and moral basis on which 
they regard loyalty as their revolutionary sense of obligation. 
  Revolutionary faith is a noble ideological sentiments 
combining faith in the justness of the revolutionary cause led 
by the leader and the inevitability of its victory and a firm 
determination and will to fight it out for the victory of the 
revolution. 
  Only when loyalty is cherished as the revolutionary faith 
can 
it be true loyalty without pretence or inconstancy. 
  The revolutionary outlook on the leader is the most correct 
view and outlook on the position and role of the leader in the 
revolutionary struggle, an attitude and stand of holding the 
leader in high esteem with sincerity. 
  When the revolutionaries deeply grasp from theoretical and 
practical points of view that the leader holds an absolute 
position and plays a decisive role in the revolutionary struggle 
and the development of history, they can revere the leader 
unconditionally and devote their all to the leader and the 
revolutionary cause led by him, cherishing loyalty as their 
faith. 
  Only when the loyalty to the leader is cherished as a 
revolutionary faith and, at the same time, as moral obligation, 
can it remain true and long. 
  For the revolutionaries, the leader is a tender-hearted 
teacher and father who gives the most precious political 
integrity to them, brings them up and looks after them with deep 
loving care and trust and leads them along the revolutionary 
road. Accordingly, the relationship between the leader and his 
revolutionary soldiers is not that between right and duty, 
between domination and obedience, but that between loving care 
and obligation to repay it. 
  Every one must grasp the truth that the leader is the centre 
of socio-political organism and feel grateful to the leader's 
loving care and trust in practical life. Only then, can he or 
she deem loyalty to the leader as the rule of conduct and 
mission of a revolutionary, not mere sense of duty, and remain 
faithful to the leader to the last. 
  The Korean people are filled with a singlehearted desire to 
firmly believe only in the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and 
follow his leadership with loyalty no matter which way the wind 
may blow and how many times the world may change, the article 
declares.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- The Korean people have 
effected a new upsurge in socialist construction upholding the 
reovolutionary banner of self-reliance. 
  Workers and other labouring masses in different parts of the 
country have registered palpable successes in production and 
construction by displaying the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance even under the circumstances where the 
imperialists and reactionaries were trying hard to isolate and 
stifle Korea. 
  On the occasion of the April fete, many construction 
projects, including the May 18 mine in Songchon, the Undok 
garment factory in Pyongsong, the South Pyongan provincial 
dental preventive hospital and the Kaechon-Sunchon railway 
electrification project, have been completed and put into 
operation. 
  The workers of the Kim Chong-tae general electric locomotive 
works manufactured new-type tram cars and subway cars in 
February last. 
  The revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is the traditional 
fighting spirit of the Korean people. 
  The history of the Korean people building a powerful 
socialist country of independence, self-sustenance and 
self-reliance in defence on this land is a history of brilliant 
application of the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. 
  In the first six months of 1954, less than one year after 
the 
ceasefire, the Korean people built and rehabilitated more than 
one hundred factories and enterprises, including the Nampo 
smelting complex, the Pyongyang textile combine and the Huichon 
general machine tool works, and built dwelling houses with a 
total floor space of 620,000 square meters in towns and workers' 
residential quarters and schools with a total floor space of 
300,000 square meters, under the difficult circumstances where 
everything was destroyed by the war. 
  In the latter half of the 50s when the raw and other 
materials and funds were in short supply and technical force was 
weak the Korean people made by their own efforts such machines 
as trucks, tractors, bulldozers and water pumps, and the workers 
of Kangson produced 120,000 tons of steel with a blooming mill 
with a rated capacity of 60,000 tons. 
  The machine industrial sector witnessed such an amazing 
success as producing more than 13,000 machine tools a year 
outside the state plan. 
  The builders of the Haeju-Hasong (80 kilometers) railway 
section completed in only 75 days the gigantic project involving 
a 880,000 cubic meters earthwork, the construction of a 5,600 
square meters retaining wall, 38 bridges, 19 station buildings, 
a railway section and section gangs and dwelling houses for 200 
families. 
  The Korean people who carried out the historical task of 
socialist industrialization in a matter of 14 years (1957- 1970) 
built many factories and enterprises, including the Sunchon 
vinalon complex, the Namhung youth chemical complex and the 
Taechon general hydro-power station, and produced such modern 
machines as a 10,000 ton press, an extra-large oxygen plant and 
numerical control machine tools in the 70s and 80s, too, by 
their own efforts by displaying the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance. 
  More than 11,000 projects were completed in the industrial 
sector during the 3rd seven-year plan (1987-1993). 
  Korea now has a solid independent national economy not 
affected by any economic fluctuation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- Railway workers of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea are greeting their holiday 
(May 11) with an increase in transportation. 
  According to data available at the Ministry of Railways, the 
daily freight haulage entering this month is 6,000 to 7,000 tons 
more than in the same period last month. 
  The General Bureau of Western Railways is topping the daily 
plan of freight turnover by 2,000 to 3,000 tons through well 
organized and commanded transportation. 
  The Kaechon General Bureau of Railways is overfulfilling the 
daily transport plan at an average of 107 percent. 
  The General Bureaus of Eastern and Northern Railways are 
carrying more freight than the plan by effectively controlling 
the locomotives, wagons and facilities. 
  Many railway stations including the Sariwon Youth Station, 
the Sinanju Youth Station, the Nanam Station and Pungnyon 
Station have hit the transport targets for the first half of the 
year more than two months earlier than schedule. 
  Railway builders have effected new innovations in the 
construction of railways including the Namdong-Onchon line.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- A human evolution history 
research team of Kim Il-song University recently unearthed in 
and around Pyongyang 42 pieces of 20 fossil men, 298 pieces of 
stone implements, 109 pieces of bone implements, two bone 
sculptures and 34,702 pieces of fossil animals belonging to the 
Paleolithic age and 15 pieces of six fossil men, 23 pieces of 
stone implements, six pieces of bone implements, 43 pieces of 
earthenware, one piece of ornament and 1,047 pieces of fossil 
animals belonging to the Neolithic age and 12 pieces of five 
fossil men, one piece of earthenware and two pieces of stone 
implements belonging to the Bronze age. 
  In this connection, a symposium for reading papers on the 
scientific research into fossil men and relics recently 
unearthed in and around Pyongyang took place at Kim Il-song 
University Thursday. 
  Published at the symposium were data about a profound 
scientific and theoretical analysis of the archaeological 
significance of the fossil men and relics discovered in Chungri 
cave, Yonggok cave No. 1 and Taehung caves Nos. 1 and 3 and the 
features of the bones of ancient Koreans and the results of the 
research into the systematic evolution of Koreans in Pyongyang. 
  According to them, scores of pieces of relics unearthed from 
the first and second cultural layers of the Paleolithic age in 
Chungri cave show that the cultural traditions of primitive men 
who left the Komunmoru relics were carried forward by their 
descendants in Pyongyang. 
  The geologic time of Yonggok cave No. 1 where ten fossil men 
were unearthed on the second, third and fourth cultural layers 
of the Paleolithic age ranges from the beginning of the 
Pleistocene epoch to the Holocene epoch of the Quaternary period 
and that of Taehung cave No. 1 where three fossil men were 
unearthed on the cultural layer of the Paleolithic age ranges 
from the end of the Pleistocene epoch to the beginning of the 
Holocene epoch of the Quaternary period. 
  In Taehung cave No. 3 fossil men, 43 pieces of earthenware 
and 65 fossil bones of animals were discovered. The earthenware 
used by ancient Koreans in Pyongyang represents their wisdom and 
creative talent and noble esthetics. It is patent proof that 
the common features of the culture of the homogeneous Korean 
nation were carried forward in the Neolithic age, too. 
  The fossil human bones and relics which have been unearthed 
and studied prove that the evolution of Koreans took place in 
Pyongyang in regular order. 
  This is because the features of Koreans were formed in due 
sequence with Pyongyang as the centre, the culture of ancient 
Koreans was developed systematically with Pyongyang as the 
centre and Pyongyang was the best place for the life of mankind. 
  The participants in the symposium said the symposium proved 
that the evolution of Koreans took place in this land, notably 
in Pyongyang in regular order and that Pyongyang had sufficient 
natural conditions and paleontological conditions for the origin 
and development of ancient Koreans.

  [Text] In view of the fact that a state of emergency has 
been declared in Yemen, the government now holds growing 
expectations for the early approval of the Self-Defense Force 
[SDF] Law revision so the SDF can be mobilized to rescue 
Japanese residing abroad. This issue was shelved for further 
deliberations at the last Diet session. Since the outbreak of 
the civil war in Yemen, the safety of Japanese residing there 
cannot be assured. Under the current situation, however, the 
Japanese Government is incapable of helping them to flee the 
country but has to rely on other countries. For example, they 
will have "to take advantage of" vacancies on military aircraft 
or vessels of other countries. And it is believed the 
government has also taken into consideration the situation when 
overseas Japanese have to be rescued in case of economic 
sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea). 
  With regard to Japanese residing in Yemen, the government 
issued recommendations for evacuation on 9 May. However, since 
the government cannot mobilize the SDF or government aircraft 
for the rescue operation, a total of 70 Japanese -- as reported 
by the Foreign Ministry -- have sought safety in such places as 
Djibouti in Africa by U.S., German and Italian military aircraft 
or French military vessels. 
  In this connection, Administrative Vice Foreign Minister 
Kunihiko Saito stressed at a news conference on 9 May that the 
SDF Law has to be revised at an early date.

researchers of Nissei Research Institute: "New Businesses Plug

How is the Japanese industrial structure transforming 
amidst the worst deflationary recession since the war? The 
authors assert that new businesses, which up to now had been 
jeered as "gap industries," have acquired citizenship as the 
pulling force of industry amidst the clear appearance of a shift 
in individual demand which has been an undercurrent for a long 
time.

  Debate over the structural conversion has risen like the 
contention of a hundred schools of thought, but those which do 
not fully grasp reality are found here and there. If you try to 
get hold of the industrial structure by numbers, a structural 
conversion is already proceeding steadily right before you. 
  It is a somewhat paradoxical way of saying it, but the 
current industrial structure is again returning to a long-term 
trend. The changes in the period of the bubble economy were 
rather dissociated from the trends of Japanese industry. Viewing 
the margin of the dissociation from the average for industry 
overall in sales increase rates (over the previous year) in the 
various materials, machinery, and individual consumption-related 
sectors, the materials-related as a trend fell about 4 to 5 
percent below increases in sales for industry as a whole with 
repeated fluctuations due to economic fluctuations (including 
price revolution due to the oil shocks and high yen). Even 
viewing the average for some past 10 years in the 
machinery-related, it has been on about the same level as the 
increase in the average for industry overall. On the other hand, 
growth in the individual consumption-related sector (food, 
retail sales, business services, and other services) greatly 
exceeds the others. 
  For several years in the bubble economy period, this 
individual consumption-related sector fell below the materials 
and machinery sectors and was dissociated from the long-term 
trend, but later, in the three-year period from 1991 to the 
present, it has been found to be returning again to the trend. 
  This change in the sales by industry is due to long-term 
structural adjustments in the so-called key industries. It is 
generated by most economic recession situations, and there have 
been great adjustments in business sectors in this recession 
also. However, these adjustments have been much more prolonged 
than before, and there is a strong possibility that sales in key 
industry will be stagnant over a long period. 
  One of the reasons is that the profit level is very low. 
Considered from the rulings on ROE (rate of return on equity) 
and interest, an ROE on the level of 6 to 7 percent is necessary 
for stockholders. According to the calculations of our research 
institute, an ordinary profit corresponding to about 2.2 times 
fiscal 1993 (estimate only) in the listed manufacturing industry 
average must be secured in order to obtain this ROE. Even if 
sales in fiscal 1994 and thereafter take a steady pattern of 
growth at an annual rate of 3 percent, it will not achieve it 
until fiscal 1997, and the growth of business will decline 
greatly because of the need for reduced management. 
  Deflation is another cause. There has been a price decrease 
in unit sales prices for capital and production goods for a long 
period, and a price revolution is proceeding. As a result, a 
great dissociation has occurred between sales in the materials 
and machinery sectors and the unit sales price in the individual 
consumption-related sector mentioned earlier, causing a 
disparity in sales. Of course, this does not represent 
substantial scale or value added, but it is steadily changing 
the sales of industry overall. 
  Already, such structural change is clearly proceeding in the 
finance aspect as well. Table 1 is the loan growth rate by 
industrial category for banks nationwide. Bank loan growth has 
been largely dull for the past two or three years; however, 
unlike the bubble era, loans for the service industry and 
individuals have been firm in tone, and the growth in the loan 
balance for both amounts to over 70 percent of the whole.

  Even taking this commanding view of Japanese industry, it 
will be difficult in the future for the key industries, which 
are tormented by the triple afflictions of investment demand 
adjustments, international competitiveness decline, and price 
adjustments, to play the role of the pulling force of industry 
like before. Since that is the case, regardless of a tight 
purse, demand related to consumption by individuals that are 
tops in the world in income level, will have to have a role in 
supporting economic growth in both market volume and growth 
stability. Actual numbers also suggest that. 
<H5>  New Business Ground </H5>
  Already, the industry group that centers on fields related 
to 
individual consumption has formed a big market in the United 
States. In Japan, too, a considerable number of businesses which 
have scouted for new business chances under the recent 
recessionary situation exist and still are continuing growth. 
  There are 54 companies among the listed companies that have 
achieved increased revenue and profits for four consecutive 
terms, including fiscal 1993 estimates. The majority of these 
businesses are businesses that have succeeded with a consumption 
service model closely adhered to life, requisites such as food 
or medicine, or unique knowhow or strategy. The products or 
services that they provide often are seen as those which add to 
the pursuit of "convenience" and contribute to "comfort." 
  Particularly in the individual living field, food-related 
(retort foods, food supermarkets), fixed services accompanying 
changes in lifestyle (convenience stores, family game software, 
credit cards), business conditions pursuing low prices (suburban 
men's clothing stores), and medical product-related businesses 
stand out. Moreover, one characteristic is the growth of 
security and environment-related businesses. 
  On the other hand, viewing the number of new open businesses 
since fiscal 1991, while service, distribution, and the 
transport-related have reached close to 50 percent of the whole, 
the manufacturing industry percentage is no more than a little 
over 30 percent. Particularly when comparing fiscal 1991 and 
1992 and thereafter, the service industry, including finance, 
rapidly increased from 20.3 percent to 29.2 percent while the 
manufacturing industry share dropped from 38.1 percent to 31.0 
percent. 
  Among the newly opened businesses, businesses which have 1) 
new services for the individual, 2) low prices, 3) new ideas and 
4) new technology as sales items especially are noted. They are 
discounters, low price dining-out chains (pubs, buckwheat 
noodles, gyoza [pot-stickers]), take-out chains (lunches, 
sushi), various types of information services, game software, 
and mobile communications-related businesses. These businesses 
are, so to speak, businesses which have broken previous 
established concepts and boldly made a challenge in new fields. 
It is believed that the impact of this "new business group" will 
increase year by year in the future also. 
  In retrospect, among the industries that currently have 
built 
a stable position, for example, the volume sales stores that 
appeared as a price-breaking business situation in the 1970's 
and 1980's, or the dining-out industry where new soft service 
has succeeded, roadside shops, convenience stores, home 
delivery, and family game software, etc., were truly small new 
businesses when they appeared. In other words, the group of 
businesses which are growing in the current recessionary 
situation give a hint for finding the new growth fields of Japan 
in the future, and we are now in our infancy. 
  Industries which have advanced into territories that cannot 
be covered by the major industries already established in Japan 
and fields where new consumer needs or ideas have been made into 
a business and there is no existing industry have come to be 
treated by the somewhat jeering expression of "niche industries" 
or "gap industries." However, the success of home deliveries, 
family game software, convenience stores, and take-out lunch 
chains exceeds a mere "gap." The new industry fields which are 
now suddenly rising to power should be valued positively as 
"tomorrow's industries group" that will actually shoulder the 
next-generation industries, and we have been rather slow in 
acknowledging their true worth. 
  The largest bases which produce these new businesses are the 
"emphasis on individual life" and "changes of the social 
environment." If the basic framework which supported the 
development of Japanese industry has been for "the realization 
of material, affluent life" domestically and "export promotion" 
externally for acquisition of foreign currency, it is the social 
needs of "aging," "health orientation," "spiritual affluence," 
and "life emphasis" which will support the businesses of the 
future, and it would be no exaggeration to say that it depends 
on promoting a domestic demand type of business territory. 
  Even in the United States, the fast growing businesses in 
recent years have been concentrated in fields such as medical 
care, information communications, and distribution, reflecting 
changes of the industrial structure. Like the United States, 
where while hollowing out of the manufacturing industry was 
proceeding, computer software and entertainment industries made 
inroads in the world market and established their position, it 
is clear that the replacement of growth fields due to industrial 
structural changes has been steadily proceeding in Japan also. 
The most important point would be how the businesses will "break 
groud" and "develop into business" out of territories where 
growth is anticipated. In other words, there is a strong 
possibility that the future will be clearly defined by 
differences in strategy by individual businesses rather than 
specific industrial fields like before. 
<H5>  Industrial Groups of Tomorrow </H5>
  Bearing in mind the fields which have been producing new 
growth businesses and separating them into categories where a 
high possibility of growth is anticipated in the future, they 
can generally be divided into the following six: "living-related 
businesses," "information communications new product fields," 
aging and health businesses," "time consumption, comfort, and 
affluence businesses," "environment-related businesses," and 
"low price pursuit businesses." 
  These new businesses are already forming large markets, in 
some fields. Just in fields where it is possible to grasp or 
estimate market scale, it has now reached a scale of 49 trillion 
yen. Furthermore, to estimate the future market based on the 
growth rate for the past several years and taking the 
possibility of future market expansion into consideration, the 
market is expected to expand to a total amount of roughly 89 
trillion yen in 2000, including 35 trillion yen for living and 
individual service-related as well as 20 trillion yen for the 
time consumption and comfort field, and the percentage occupied 
in Japan's industrial sector will rise by leaps and bounds.

  It no longer is an age when Japanese industry can expect 
"aggregate growth." Businesses which take up the challenge of 
markets with latent growth and risk and introduce new growth 
fields should be praised as truly excellent companies.

<F P=106> [Article by journalist Koei Kaga: "Secret Strife in MITI </F>
Erupts With Resignation Drama, Greatest `Shame'"] 
  [Text] It was 1010 on 16 December 1993. 
  Masahisa Naito, director of the Industrial Policy Bureau 
(class of 1961), Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI], was suddenly summoned by a telephone call from the 
minister's private secretary, "Please come immediately." 
  What can it be? 
  Tilting his head to one side, he thought, "It must be that." 
  A few days before, Naito had sat around a table of Chinese 
food with MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai. It was about that time. 
  "Hey, I'm asking you for economic countermeasures," said the 
small-statured minister. It was a scene where he impishly began 
massaging both of Naito's shoulders in an exaggerated manner and 
the associates who were with them convulsed with laughter. 
  The Diet was being pressed for discussion on the political 
reform bill and economic countermeasures, and Kasumigaseki was 
also being pressed for measures. Moreover, the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] had left public office with the July 
general election, the 1955 rule that had built postwar Japan had 
collapsed, and the coalition cabinet that was borne in its place 
had been calling for reform of the bureaucratic system which 
continued to support the old rule. 
  The bureaucratic society of Kasumigaseki was about to face a 
crisis, but those around Naito were full of peace and harmony. 
  Minister Kumagai has been criticized as "a capricious man 
who 
is an associate or lackey" of Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] secretary general (political source), but he is a 
former MITI bureaucrat two years junior to Naito and they are 
not entire strangers to each other. 
  Thinking that it must be a discussion on economic 
countermeasures, Naito trotted toward the minister's office 
carrying the related data. 
  However, when Naito stepped into the minister's office, he 
noticed something unusual about Kumagai. He usually keeps his 
private secretary present, but for some odd reason, Kumagai 
seemed not to want his secretary around, but to be alone with 
Naito, and he was trying to feel out Naito's demeanor with an 
upward place. 
  When Naito sat down, abruptly Kumagai said coldly, just as 
if 
in jest, "It's hard for me to say this to you, but I want you to 
resign." 
  "Based on cabinet policy, I want to change public feeling 
completely," he added. 
  The blood ran out of Naito's whole body. Frightened, he 
asked 
in return "Er, when?" 
  "During this month or next month. I would like it carried 
out 
as soon as the personnel system is settled." 
  It normally is the Kasumigaseki custom that the 
administrative vice minister orders personnel changes. This case 
was unprecedented. When Naito rushed into the vice minister's 
office flustered by this unexpected development, Vice Minister 
Hideaki Kumano said with an expression filled with bitterness, 
"Actually, I spoke with him two hours last night and one hour 
this morning for a total of three hours, but couldn't get him to 
change his mind." 
  "How many are targeted for resignation?" 
  "...only one, you." 
  "That is strange. That is absurd. There can't be complete 
change in public feeling with the resignation of just one 
person. I cannot accept it." 
  When Naito protested, Kumano merely hung his head and was 
silent. 
  What about the deputy vice minister? The deputy vice 
minister, who is said to be one with the vice minister, should 
have known about this matter. When Deputy Vice Minister Chikara 
Makino heard Naito's story, however, he squeaked, "What?" He 
jumped back with his mouth still wide open. 
  "I haven't heard anything about that!" 
  Not only MITI, but Kasumigaseki got wind of this sudden 
affair and it ultimately became an uproar. Furthermore, this 
became the occasion for the factional strife that secretly had 
been proceeding in MITI and the move by Shinseito to gain 
supremacy over MITI to surface all at once. Some even said that 
politics was intervening in administration. 
  However, why was Naito, who was the number one candidate for 
next administrative vice minister and was called Mister MITI, 
forced to resign? When one investigates into the particulars, 
one will comes to feel that actually a preposterous scheme lurks 
behind this strife, and the firing of Naito is in line with a 
carefully and minutely elaborated scenario. 
  Naito met with the treachery of his colleagues who, so to 
speak, have stepped over the fence between administration and 
politics and "shaken hands with the devil," and his bureaucratic 
career of 32 years and nine months came to an end. This was a 
kind of coup d'etat. 
  At the same time, this tumult unintentionally brought to the 
light the "greatest shame" which had been fervently concealed 
for many years by MITI, reputed to be a first-class government 
agency -- the factional strife which has even involved 
officials' wives who hang out in MITI and some allegations 
concerning grants of the Japan Keirin Association (bicycle 
racing) that was called the MITI moneybag. 
<H5>  "Responsibility for Darkening MITI" </H5>
  The issue of the resignation of Director Naito of the MITI 
Industrial Policy Bureau that shook Kasumigaseki at the end of 
1993 was widely reported even by first-rate newspapers. 
  Ultimately, this uproar was seen to have calmed down some 
because Naito accepted the minister's advice to resign on 22 
December and gave his resignation dated the 24 December 1993. 
  However, here again the issue has begun to fan a new fire. 
"Why did Director Naito of the Industrial Policy Bureau have to 
resign?" There is no sufficient reason to explain that. 
  Minister Kumagai made public two reasons for recommending 
Naito's resignation. They were: 1) on the occasion of Hirobumi 
(1987 group), eldest son of the former Administrative Vice 
Minister Yuji Tanahashi, retiring from MITI in January 1993 to 
run in the general election of July 1993, Naito, who was then 
the deputy vice minister, was responsible for using favoritism 
in a prestigious personnel change, and 2) responsibility for 
darkening MITI. 
  Regarding the first reason, the majority was occupied by 
those who said that "Prestigious personnel changes were a 
customary practice in Kasumigaseki and certainly cannot be 
called good. However, what about the sacking? This was absurd 
like pronouncing a death sentence by commiting a public 
indecency like urination by the roadside. What explanation 
would he offer about Minister Kumagai himself receiving that 
prestige when he set out in the political world" (MITI former 
official)? 
  Regarding "chief of the Policy Discussion Office, Small and 
Medium Enterprise Agency," the prestigious post which Minister 
Kumagai himself received, the people in Kasumigaseki firmly 
believe that "It was nothing like the post, `planning officer,' 
of Hirobumi Tanahashi which has now become the issue, Kumagai's 
post was closely associated with local small and medium 
enterprises, and it was a highly prestigious position that 
served straight in the election. The title, study abroad at 
Harvard University which Minister Kumagai effectively uses in 
election [campaigns], is also a permission for study abroad 
which Naito originally received after passing a rigorous 
examination, and Minister Kumagai has received concession of the 
privilege for nothing. He should not bear a grudge when he owes 
Naito gratitude. 
  "Tanahashi is said to have a special promotion to seventh 
class with prestige, but that too is misunderstood. There was no 
skipping of years and no pay raise. It is difficult to 
understand why he said such a thing when the minister himself 
should have known that" (MITI former official). 
  Then there is the second reason. 
  That originated by the circulation of a mysterious 
defamatory 
document that divulged the prestigious personnel change of 
former Vice Minister Tanahashi's son and censured the former 
vice minister (consultant to Industrial Research Center) in the 
first part of August 1993. A second mysterious defamatory 
document appeared in September. After this happened, at the 
beginning of October, a Komeito representative in the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee questioned this incident and 
Minister Kumagai promised enforcement of official discipline. 
Meanwhile, a clamor arose when a group of lawyers brought a 
charge against former Vice Minister Tanahashi to the Tokyo 
District Public Prosecutor. 
  However, it has also been strongly voiced that "What 
darkened the ministry was the one who circulated the mysterious 
defamatory documents. The mysterious defamatory documents 
generally censured Tanahashi and did not directly reproach 
Naito. In spite of that, Naito was forced to resign for merely 
having been the confidant of Tanahashi. If this is allowed to go 
unchallenged, the people who are put out the mysterious 
defamatory documents will all have to resign. Conceding that it 
is a dispute between fellow factions, the Tanahashi faction 
versus the anti-Tanahashi faction, the common sense is that the 
two guilty parties should be punished together. It is absurd 
that just to have Director Naito resign" (MITI division chief). 
  Moreover, the questioning in the House of Representatives is 
reported to have been an extremely shabby collusive backdoor 
maneuver of questioning. It was said to have been requested by 
Minister Kumagai himself who handed over the mysterious 
defamatory document to a Komeito Diet member (he has denied it 
in the newspapers), and the allegations have raised bugbears. 
  Regardless of the special promotion and so forth, a powerful 
vice minister's preferential treatment in the ministry for his 
own son to sent him out in the election with a completely new 
title cannot escape censure of mixing public and private 
matters. On that point, the disparity with general common sense 
and the lack of work ethic that permeates all of Kasumigaseki is 
outrageous. Moreover, criticism cannot be helped of the 
deviation from political neutrality which is sought in public 
servants such as the closeness between Tanahashi and leaders of 
the LDP such as Seiroku Kajiyama, former secretary general, and 
the assistance in his son's election, which was touched on by 
the series of mysterious defamatory documents censuring 
Tanahashi. Actually, the initial general response of public 
opinion was strong cries for proper punishment in this drama of 
dismissal from office. 
  However, the issue is that this drama of dismissal from 
office was a scheme devised to correct such indulgences of 
bureaucratic society and slackening of official discipline. In 
the first place, regardless of how much responsibility there is 
as the authority in personnel matters, the dismissal from office 
of the incumbent director of the Industrial Policy Bureau just 
for that is utterly unreasonable. 
  In other words, the reason for recommending Naito's 
resignation is not clear. 
  Far from that, it is now openly mentioned in Kasumigaseki 
that "The ringleader who contrived the resignation of Director 
Naito related in any form to the mysterious defamatory documents 
was Takashima, director of the Industrial Location and 
Environmental Protection Bureau (1963 group, two years below 
Naito) of the anti-Tanahashi faction with cooperation of Hisashi 
Hosokawa, director of the Basic Industries Bureau (1964 group); 
Masataka Nakano, director of the International Economics 
Department, International Trade Policy Bureau (1967 group); and 
Takeyuki Isayama, director of the Economic Cooperation 
Department, International Trade Policy Bureau (1967 group), and 
that it linked to Yukiharu Kodama, former administrative vice 
minister (director of Central Cooperative Bank for Commerce and 
Industry)." 
  However, it is said that "Neither the minister nor Vice 
Minister Kumano has any intention of finding the culprit" (MITI 
source). What in the world is this? 
  Is Director Takashima really the ringleader? We will 
investigate this matter in due time, but before that, let's 
touch a little more on the details of the Naito resignation 
uproar. One can feel as if one were actually being there how 
MITI might have fallen into the absurd situation with this drama 
of personnel change. 
<H5>  Whole Story of Dismissal From Office Drama </H5>
  Combining the testimony of Naito that was obtained at the 
end 
1993, several opinions from inside MITI together with the 
testimony of former Vice Minister Tanahashi, we shall try to 
reproduce that time as faithfully as possible. 
  Having suddenly received the advice to resign on the morning 
of the 16th, Naito immediately made telephone calls from the 
Industrial Policy Bureau director's office to former officials 
Toshinobu Wada (president, Petroleum Resources Development Co.), 
Keiichi Ohase (president, Arabia Oil Co.), and Yoshihiki 
Morozumi (power development consultant) with experience as a 
successive administrative vice ministers. It has been a common 
practice in the past to put a call through in some form to the 
former officials about such personnel changes. However, they 
knew nothing about it. 
  Meanwhile, Minister Kumagai was making calls to the former 
officials to explain the situation about the same time that 
Naito was making the calls. However, in addition to those two 
reasons mentioned earlier, the minister had two more reasons: 
One was the issue of Naito's closeness to specific businesses. 
The other was that he had gone too far into politics. Regarding 
the latter, the minister made the explanation to the former 
officials that "Former Administrative Vice Minister Tanahashi, 
who has deep connections with the LDP, has been carrying out a 
movement to unseat the cabinet, and Naito has cooperated in 
leaking information to him. Or, Naito is on close terms with 
Secretary General Takemura of Sakigake [Harbinger] and has 
leaked information that the minister himself does not know. 
  Moreover, when the minister went visiting back home after 
becoming minister, Naito, who went with him to Shizuoka as an 
aide, humiliated him by saying that "You should discuss such an 
important matter with Kajiyama" when he received petitions from 
local supporters. 
  Regardless of whether the details are authentic, undoubtedly 
there was a political opposition structure of "Sakigake versus 
Shinseito" under the coalition regime or "Ozawa/Kumagai 
Shinseito versus Kajiyama LDP" behind this tumult from the start. 
  Meanwhile, what about collusion to special enterprises. 
  This was the involvement in a scandal long ago with receipt 
of a kickback from an oil company with close ties to MITI. 
  However, Minister Kumagai, when he mentioned that, was 
perplexed at the reply returned by one of the former officials 
that "Is there clear proof of that?" and backed down threatened 
back by, "We are absolutely opposed to the firing of Naito. If 
you do such an unreasonable thing, all of MITI will become your 
enemy. All right?" 
  That night, it is said that in the ministry, "Vice Minister 
Kumano summoned Bureau Director Takashima and the two had a 
secret discussion alone for about an hour and a half. Moreover, 
Minister Kumagai and Deputy Vice Minister Makino discussed the 
Naito problem, but there was no headway in agreement on the 
matter, and later Vice Minister Kumano joined them" (talk inside 
MITI). What did they discuss? 
  On 16 December 1993, the political world was in great 
disarray by the death of former Prime Minister Tanaka. In the 
afternoon, Vice Minister Kumano entered the prime minister's 
official residence in a fluster. There is evidence that a 
considerable quarrel took place there about the Naito problem. 
  That night, a person identifying himself as "someone from 
MITI" telephoned newspapers and reported: "Industrial Policy 
Bureau Chief Naito just received the advise to resign. The 
reason was favoritism in personnel changes and closeness to 
special businesses." Someone clearly had come to stab Naito. 
  On the next day, the 17th, at 1100, in the minister's 
office, 
Kumagai again pressed for Naito's resignation, citing two 
reasons. 
  "Whether it was common practice or not, I apologize for 
having carried out the prestigious personnel changes. However, 
I cannot accept the assessment of resignation. After all, you 
too move out to the political world with a prestigious personnel 
change." 
  When Naito protested this way, Kumagai asserted, "It is not 
an issue of legality. It is an issue of propriety." 
  When Naito touched upon his collusion with special 
businesses, etc. which Kumagai himself spread, Kumagai suddenly 
changed his attitude, and holding his head in his hands and even 
with a smile on his face, he said: 
  "Oh, what to do! I am troubled because you say such a thing. 
I am troubled that such misleading information has been 
circulating around when I haven't said anything about the 
slightest dishonesty regarding you." 
  Ultimately, Naito stood up and left, saying, "If you must 
insist on my resignation, why don't you fire me?" 
  When he went immediately to the administrative vice 
minister's office, Vice Minister Kumano looked at the state of 
Naito and in a fluster called Makino, "Deputy Vice Minister, 
Deputy Vice Minister!" The two, however, only bowed their heads 
upon receiving Naito's report. The silence was unbroken. 
Ultimately, the three remained silent for five minutes. 
  Within the ministry, on the other hand, "The rumor of 
Takashima's quite unforeseen appointment to director of the 
Industrial Policy Bureau circulated." (MITI employee) 
  Around 1400, Naito again confronted both Kumano and Makino 
in 
the vice minister's office. Here, for the first time, Kumano 
broached the matter, "As the authority for personnel changes, I 
would like you to resign." 
  However, when he was told by Naito that this was a strange 
way of making a personnel change, he said, "It cannot be helped 
because it is an order from the minister." When asked the 
reason, he again said, "The same reasons as those of the 
minister." 
  Moreover, when he was questioned by Naito on the propriety 
of 
each reason for dismissal, he mentioned that "No, I myself do 
not believe the second one that you have darkened it 
(ministry)...." 
  "Actually, when the first mysterious defamatory document 
came 
out, Director Naito twice advised Vice Minister Kumano to seek 
the culprit. However, the vice minister refused, saying that 
`The ministry will be darkened if there is a search for the 
culprit.' In September, however, the second mysterious 
defamatory document came out. It was senseless ethics because 
even the responsibility for the second mysterious defamatory 
document came to hang over the head of Naito by saying that `he 
had darkened the ministry'" (MITI bureaucrat). 
  Ultimately, Vice Minister Kumano broke off with Naito by 
persisting, "Resign right now." 
<H5>  Administrative Vice Minister Kumano Laments </H5>
  However, an unexpected situation occurred. The news, "Naito 
advised to resign," was reported in the evening edition of that 
day's ASAHI SHIMBUN. 
  Confound it! 
  Although this was what he thought, it was too late. Naito 
was 
resigned to the fact that he no longer would work beneath the 
surface. 
  However, this report drew out unexpected results. The MITI 
bureaucrats who became clearly aware of the situation by this 
pushed their way into the administrative vice minister's office 
in a body. That continued the next day, Saturday, and Sunday, 
and it is said that they exceeded 100 in number. 
  Many pressed Vice Minister Kumano, "Can you permit such an 
absurd personnel change? This is improper political 
intervention." However, surprised Vice Minister Kumano "only 
cried bitterly with no explanation of the reasons at all, and 
we, too, were perplexed" (MITI bureaucrat). 
  Among them, the group who had joined the ministry in 1978 
gave notice, "Since all 13 of us are submitting letters of 
resignation, both the administrative vice minister and deputy 
vice minister should also submit them and negotiate with the 
minister. Such a thing cannot be permitted." 
  In the common sense view of Kasumigaseki, it is the 
invariable principle that in such a case the vice minister also 
write a letter of resignation and battle with the minister. 
However, Vice Minister Kumano just cried at this point and made 
no move to act. 
  On the other hand, there were constant telephone calls of 
encouragement to Naito who kept to his home on Saturday and 
Sunday, and even bureaucrats from other government agencies 
visited his home to encourage him. Hails came from acquaintances 
in the United States. 
  At this point, however, Naito and the bureaucrats were 
seized 
by an idea. In other words, everyone thought that the reasons 
for the advice to resign clearly made no sense at all. 
Therefore, there must be something bigger behind this series of 
unusual situations, and the real reason could be that such as 
the whole MITI itself would be saved by Naito's resignation. 
  At the beginning of the week on the 20th, Naito himself 
pressed Vice Minister Kumano for an answer on that point. 
However, the scene that unfolded from that was even more strange. 
  Naito pressed Vice Minister Kumano twice on this day, but 
Kumano only said, "It's not that." 
  When Naito appealed to him with a desperate expression that 
he should tell him now if he were hiding something and if he did 
not let everything out in the open, MITI will be questioned 
about it and would be eternally devastated by politics in the 
future, lo and behold, Kumano began crying in a loud voice. 
  "I haven't lied to you for 30 years, please believe me. 
Please believe me." 
  Then, the lamenting vice minister faced the deputy vice 
minister next to him, "Hey, Makino, what do you say?" 
  Then this time, Makino in turn let out a big cry, "Naito! 
You 
are the senior that I most respect. I am speaking only from my 
heart. There is absolutely no such thing." 
  The two merely cried. 
  On this day, Naito decided to write his resignation. 
Something collapsed within his heart. He felt that work should 
not be stagnated because of him. 
  Soon afterwards, white flowers were delivered to Naito's 
home. 
  "I was told that it was a bouquet of whilte lilies. Since 
they are funeral flowers, Naito was surprised and looked for the 
name of sender and found that it was from the wife of former 
Vice Minister Kodama. I thought that it was so thoughtless when 
I heard about it, so I told them to `throw them away!'" (wife of 
an acquaintance of Naito family). 
  This wife of Kodama was called the grande dame of the 
association of wives of MITI bureaucrats. Like the factions of 
their husbands, factions have been built up in the society of 
wives. We will mention more on this later. 
<H5>  Who Ensnared Naito? </H5>
  Speaking about the factional struggle in MITI, there was the 
"Sabashi incident" that occurred during the era of the Ikeda 
cabinet. 
  This originated from unscrupulous Shigeru Sabashi, who 
called 
himself "a unique bureaucrat," formed factions with forced 
personnel changes and resulted in the creation of an 
anti-Sabashi faction in the ministry. 
  Sabashi was seated in the chair of Corporate Bureau (now 
Industrial Policy Bureau) director, which was called specified 
seat for those who were expected to become vice minister, but in 
1963, when the long-desired vice ministry was imminent, he was 
disliked by then minister Hajime Fukuda and skipped over. This 
became an occasion for the factional struggle within the 
ministry to intensify. 
  At a glance, it seems to resemble the current tumult. In the 
"Sabashi incident," however, a policy dispute between the 
Sabashi faction (national faction) and anti-Sabashi faction 
(international faction) surrounding the propriety of economic 
liberalization that would control Japanese commercial policy in 
the future was at the root. However, there is no policy debate 
in the recent tumult. 
  Whether it be the mysterious defamatory documents or the 
actions of Minister Kumagai, only a fairly deep-rooted malice 
can be felt in the undercurrents of the recent tumult. 
  Naito grumbles, "I still don't know why I had to resign." 
  It will be much easier to understand if we interpret this 
tumult that the firing of Naito was the sole objective and the 
reason for his dismissal from office by favoritism in personnel 
changes was appended afterward. 
  Who in the world ensnared Naito, then? 
  The fingerprints appear in the first mysterious defamatory 
document which became the origin of the resignation drama. 
  It was distributed at the beginning of August 1993. 
According 
to a MITI source, it was mailed to all those who were division 
chief or above and about 600 copies were sent. 
  There is a point that we should note. The senders were "all 
concerned younger members of MITI," but the contents of the 
document was not something that they ounger members could have 
written. 
  For example, the information about Hirobumi Tanahashi's 
appointment as planning officer (prestigious) on 25 December 
1992 and retiring from the post one week after and that the same 
post was eliminated (recently changed to that form) after that, 
etc... The specific date pointed out in the mysterious 
defamatory document and the fact that the post was eliminated 
(recently changed to that form) were known only to specific 
people at a considerably high level among those concerned at 
MITI who were familiar with personnel change information. 
  "The information in the mysterious defamatory document has 
to 
be perceived as coming from people inside MITI" (Masahiro 
Fujita, chief of Public Relations Division, MITI). 
  In other words, it is certain that people inside MITI 
contributed to preparation of the mysterious defamatory 
document. This is a decisive fact. 
  Who was that? 
  Actually, the name of the "culprit" was already rumored 
within MITI from the time of the first mysterious defamatory 
document delivery. For example, there is this story: 
  About 20 days before circulation of the first mysterious 
defamatory document, "There was a person who said to a person 
from a certain private think tank, "`It'll be creating a big 
problem. I'll do it thoroughly. I'll turn it upside down. But 
you must absolutely keep this matter quiet" (MITI former 
official). It was the director of the Industrial Location and 
Environmental Protection Bureau Takashima, of the anti-Tanahashi 
faction. 
  Then there was the delivery of the mysterious defamatory 
document. 
  July and August are around the time in government offices 
when the ordinary June personnel change transfers have been 
completed. 
  "It is amazing that the mysterious defamatory document was 
delivered accurately to residences. Although there were people 
who had just moved and changed addresses and therefore they were 
not yet in the register, the mysterious defamatory document was 
accurately delivered to them. It is only that person who had 
the information on personnel changes could have known the new 
addresses of those who were not yet on the list (the same former 
MITI official). 
  It's amazing. According to MITI sources, there is an officer 
who is called "the boss of the Personnel Division that handles 
personnel changes." There is only one person who has had 
experience as the assistant to the chief of the Personnel 
Division, chief of the Personnel Division, and who has been the 
general affairs councilor in the Secretariat and can get 
complete information even from the non-career people. This is 
also Director Takashima. What is this? 
  It is openly acknowledged that Takashima is in the 
anti-Tanahashi faction. 
  "He became closeer to Kodama. The two often discussed `who 
would be the next vice minister and who would be the deputy 
minister.' He was a generous person and often treated junior 
members to sumptuous meals. He was on the vice minister course 
and the man himself was of that mind. 
  "However, when he fought with Makino for the post of chief 
secretary which is called a mandatory post to a vice minister, 
in spite of Kodama's recommendation, Tanahashi chose Makino, and 
he was transferred to director of the Industrial Location and 
Environmental Protection Bureau. It seems that was unbearable 
for him, and Takashima was often seen with Kodama and speak 
maliciously of Tanahashi at restaurants. For about the past 
year, he has borne a grudge against Tanahashi, complaining that 
`the rail (personnel changes) laid by Kodama was destroyed by 
this'" (MITI former official). 
  Let's take a look at the actions of the anti-Tanahashi 
faction. 
  First, there is Kodama. 
  When Minister Kumagai cited the words "darkened the 
ministry" 
as the second reason for recommending Naito to resign, there was 
an former official who was startled when he heard it. 
  According to him, "Around summer of 1993, Kodama was 
frequently telling the crowd in MITI that `I'll never let Naito 
become vice minister.' As the reason, Kodama said, `If Naito is 
made vice minister, the ministry will be darkened.'" 
  Then, as for Director Hosokawa, "There is a famous story in 
MITI that at the time of the first mysterious defamatory 
document was circulated, when a certain employee asked, 
`Hosokawa, you must have distributed this,' he unintentionally 
divulged, `No, it wasn't me. It was Kodama'" (MITI division 
class chief). 
  Moreover, when the recent tumult began, Hosokawa made a lot 
of telephone calls to presidents in the oil industry and 
reported unilaterally that, "You should not associate with 
Naito. He is acting smart now, but he will soon be arrested." 
  In September, the second mysterious defamatory document was 
distributed. This was largely divided into three items, and it 
criticised Tanahashi with various specific examples such as 
"election measures for his son" and "closeness with 
politicians." However, fingerprints remain here also. 
  "The special conference expense is pointed out here. The 
document points out that while Tanahashi was vice minister, `the 
special conference expense quickly increased from 30 million 
yen a year to 60 million yen.' Since the mysterious defamatory 
document was distributed, I was flustered. So, I checked into 
the matter and found that it was true. However, this would not 
be known unless you checked by leafing through the chits from 
restaurants, etc., one by one. It is not information that can 
be known except for a specific bureau. The one that has those 
qualifications is the Budget and Accounts Division of the 
Secretariat. The division chief at that time was Isayama" (MITI 
former official). 
  He is also said to be in the anti-Tanahashi faction. 
<H5>  Kodama Faction Knew!? </H5>
  The more you investigate, the more figures who gathered in 
the anti-Tanahashi faction network with Kodama at the top that 
could be called the Kodama faction are making an appearance. 
  Actually, Vice Minister Kumano, who recently took an 
incomprehensible action, is tied to this Kodama faction. 
  Kodama and Kumano come from the same high school affiliated 
with Hiroshima University, have a senior-junior relationship, 
and it is said in MITI that they are closer friends than 
brothers. 
  They were so close in this tumult that it is rumored "Kumano 
calls Kodama's place every night and complains" (MITI source). 
  It seems that Kumano has come to be ridiculed in MITI as 
"the 
crying Kumano" due to this tumult, but there is a possibility 
that this crying has been an act. 
  As mentioned before, Kumano explained to Naito that he first 
heard about the intention to fire Naito from Kumagai on 15 
December. However, it seems that he knew it far in advance. 
  "In the latter part of September 1993, Kumagai summoned 
Nobutsugu Fukugawa, a former powerful vice minister from Kobe 
(vice president of Kobe Steel) and they met at a restaurant in 
the city. On that occasion, Kumagai discussed the firing of 
Naito. Fukugawa said, `That is outrageous,' but it seems that 
Kumagai stubbornly refused to listen. Fukugawa immediately 
called Kumano. When he explained the situation, Kumano just 
said, `That's too bad'" (one of the former top MITI executives). 
  Why didn't Kumano discuss it immediately with Naito or the 
deputy vice minister? Because of his responsible post as vice 
minister endeavoring to protect his own ministry, it is 
customerly that he devise some countermeasures. Kumano's actions 
are utterly difficult to understand. Of course, the possibility 
is great that this matter was reported by Kumano to Kodama. 
  In short, the Kodama faction knew about Kumagai's intention 
to "fire Naito" considerably in advance, and there is suspicion 
that they conspired in it. 
  Right after 16 December when Naito received the advice to 
resign, a Diet member said to be a close associate of Ozawa 
revealed the following: 
  "Kumagai has considered this firing since directly after his 
appointment as minister. I did not know about the timing. The 
cause was the coercive methods of the former Vice Minister 
Tanahashi. He flung his son into the electoral district of Iwao 
Matsuda (Shinseito) of whom Kumagai is fond, and MITI did not 
support him when Kumagai ran as a candidate. It truly was a 
grudge of many years. Ozawa said, `Do whatever you can.'" 
  There are two points here. One is that Ozawa and Shinseito 
participated in this personnel change, and the other is that 
there was a grudge against MITI or against Tanahashi in the 
origin of this recent Kumagai action. 
  Kumagai and Takashima are very friendly. 
  "In MITI which did not support Kumagai, Takashima was the 
only friend of Kumagai" (political source). 
  The two have a grudge in common. Furthermore, the grudges 
against Tanahashi and Naito are shared by all of the Kodama 
faction. Instances believed to have become the cause have been 
revealed by several people in MITI. 
  This will be mentioned later, but among the successive 
administrative vice ministers, the attacked Tanahashi is reputed 
to be the one who stood out from the crowd in policy capability 
and political power. 
  Tanahashi is the son-in-law of former House of 
Representatives Diet member Yukiyasu Matsuno, and his eldest son 
Hirobumi, who became the recent problem, run for candidacy to 
taking over that base. 
  He has strong friendship with LDP Diet members topped by 
former LDP Secretary General Seiroku Kajiyama, and along with 
the recent dramatic change in political administrations, "There 
has been a move, centering on the Shinseito, to hunt 
bureaucratic war criminals under the old rule. Beginning around 
fall of last year, the information has been circulating that 
there have been sackings one by one from MITI, the Ministry of 
Finance (MOF), and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Different 
from MITI, MOF has solidified into a monolith of unity and seems 
to have checked this move" (Nagata-cho source). 
  If this story is true, it is not strange that he would be 
put 
in the position of the number one target. 
<H5>  Grounds for Tanahashi and Naito Were Detested </H5>
  Naito, who was supported by Tanahashi, overwhelmed others in 
the ministry with his capability. Both shared being "the ablest 
workmasters of MITI" recognized both by themselves and others." 
  There is a very interesting episode. During the 
semiconductor 
negotiations when Tanahashi and Naito formed a team for the 
first time, Tanahashi was deputy director of the Machinery and 
Information Industries Bureau, and Naito was chief of the 
Secretariat General Coordination Division. The words that MITI 
officers spoken to Tanahashi upon viewing this matching were 
that "We have placed a subordinate who is difficult to employ 
with a superior who is difficult to serve." 
  It seems that both were strict in policy evaluation and 
arguing without regard to who was superior or subordinate. For 
that reason, they were harsh on unreasonable statements and the 
failures of their fellow workers. 
  Although valued within the ministry, "they stung 
subordinates 
more than necessary and made them nervous" (younger bureaucrat). 
  Later, the two built a golden era with Vice Minister 
Tanahashi who was "the greatest political expert in 
Kasumigaseki" and Deputy Vice Minister Naito who was "the first 
international policy man since MITI began." 
  It was the whole Kodama faction who embraced a sense of 
crisis about these two. 
  There was once that Kodama tried to squash the Naito's 
chance 
by pressing Tanahashi that he should put "Masaaki Nangaku, 
director of the Consumer Goods Industries Bureau (at the time, 
same class as Naito), in as deputy vice minister." 
  "In the `VAN [value added telecommunications network] war' 
fought by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and MITI, 
the front line commander was Kodama and the his junior Kumano 
took general command of the battalion. The result, however, was 
a crushing defeat for MITI. Responsibility for what the 
Kodama-Kumano line had done at the time was shifted on others. 
Single-minded Naito criticized this like a raging fire. Kodama 
and others have painful thoughts of that time. 
  "Unfortunately, however, it was the Tanahashi-Naito team who 
succeeded afterward. They plotted a repechage and fought with 
the Ministry of Education concerning computer program rights 
along with revision of the copyright law where Kodama had failed 
and scored a real gain. This also angered Kodama" (a MITI old 
boy). 
  Moreover, in his days as chief of the Basic Chemicals 
Division, when Naito was appointed post, the petrochemical 
industry, which up to then Kodama had boasted was "my industry," 
instantly was swayed by Naito. Kodama was said to have been 
extremely angry about this. 
  Moreover, unfortunately, "Takashima and then Hosokawa 
followed as his successors, but the industry went to Naito for 
discussion when anything happened and took no notice of them" 
(MITI officer). 
  Gradually, Tanahashi and Naito began to incur hatred from 
the 
Kodama faction because of their excellence. There was an 
incident that when various ministries were united in drawing up 
two bills related to information processing, with Naito as its 
leader, "It happened that Nakano forgot about making a budget 
request for a `law concerning promotion of information 
processing.' It was an unbelievable error, and his 
responsibility amounted to whether he should resign. 
Ultimately, Naito ran around appealing to the Cabinet 
Legislation Bureau and succeeded without incident. Nakano could 
not hold up his head before Naito" (MITI former official). 
  However, that conversely became the occasion for the birth 
of 
the buds of hatred for Naito within the heart of Nakano. 
  There is another story that when Isayama went full of 
confidence to the post of JETRO [Japan External Trade 
Organization] industrial investigator in the United States which 
is considered to be an elite course in MITI, he became 
dispirited confronted by an enormous network of Naito who is 
reputed to be internationalist. 
  There is still more story that after Kodama retired from 
government office as vice minister, he was rejected by 
Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd. where he was supposed to have 
gone as vice president with implications of president, and after 
that, he had difficulty in golden parachuting. 
  "Kodama was said to have complained to those around him that 
`This, too, is the result of Tanahashi and Naito not being 
staunch for me,' and he felt resentment toward them" (MITI 
former official). 
  In short, for the Kodama faction, Tanahashi and Naito were 
an 
eyesore. That may be the natural result produced by the enormous 
envy and lust for power of the elite bureaucrats of Kasumigaseki 
hidden in the lining of their well-pressed suits. Apart from 
Tanahashi who has retired from government office, there would be 
no favors to them if a Vice Minister Naito were born. That 
probably produced in the hearts of Takashima and others an 
impatience resembling a sense of panic. "The people in Kodama 
faction were saying, `It's either Naito dies or we will be done 
for'" (MITI source). 
  Shinseito or Minister Kumagai can take advantage of a 
vulnerable point there. 
  With regard to the Kodama faction, another faction is pasted 
to them as a lining, forming a pair with the male faction. It 
probably is necessary to touch on this too. 
  The fact that Kodama's wife runs the association of MITI 
elite bureaucrat wives was touched upon a little previously. 
  The name of that association is "Ranfini." In French, it 
means "infinity." This association also is tremendous. 
  "The wives who dress up in high-quality brand clothes begin 
talking about Paris or Spain. They do not appear to be wives of 
public servants at all. Their manicures are perfect. Some of 
them wear rings with huge jewels and when they place their hands 
on the table, their palms turn over with the weight" (a 
participant). 
  This wives' association holds intact the scheme of 
opposition 
of their husbands who continue the factional strife in 
Kasumigaseki and at present is forming "a wives' version of the 
Kodama faction." 
  The core members are the wife of Kodama on down to the wife 
of Kumano, the wife of Nangaku, and others. Only the wives of 
officers who sometimes are permitted there can participate. 
  One wife who participated says, "I really hate it, but I 
participate to have my husband pulled along." 
  Worried, a husband would come asking, "I wonder if 
everything 
is all right; no one has called yet to invite my wife" (MITI 
source). 
  The husbands and wives together have tremendous influence. 
What is more surprising is the activities of these wives. 
Bearing the dignified name of "an association of wives of MITI," 
they go on tours once or twice a month to businesses under the 
jurisdiction of MITI. Moreover, the members are the wives of 
officers only. It flusters the places to which they visit. 
<H5>  "Let's Go for a Ride in Tank" </H5>
  On a factory tour of a chemical company, the chairman 
expressly came out and sweating with an uncertain hand, prepared 
food and served them. How ridiculous! 
  Moreover, the wife of Kodama suddenly said, "Let's ride in a 
tank." So, she planned a tour of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and 
surprised the members. Actually, it is said that Naito dealt 
harshly with such collusive groups. This too grated against the 
nerves of the Kodama faction. 
  However, a more serious secret is hidden in the Kodama 
faction. That is the unusual closeness with Ozawa and Shinseito. 
  In 1991, when Ozawa visited the Soviet Union and had a 
audience with then President Gorbachev, he took with him a plan 
called "return of the northern territories in exchange for $24 
billion of economic aid." Actually, it was the Kodama faction 
that prepared this plan. 
  "Kumagai introduced Kodama to Ozawa, and Kodama is linked to 
Takashima and Nakano. It was Nakano who put together the 
substance and Takashima was the captain. 
  "When that plan for $24 billion surfaced, MITI received 
protest from the various related ministries such as Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Finance because it was an 
unprecedented act exceeding authority. This has also became a 
problem in MITI itself" (MITI former official). 
  Moreover, it is said that Nakano and Isayama were in charge 
of the parts relating to MITI in Ozawa's book, Blueprint 
for Building a New Japan, and Takashima is said to be a 
member of "the association to make Ozawa prime minister" in 
Kasumigaseki. 
  Ozawa and the Kodama faction have been very close ever since 
the old LDP era. Viewing the series of introduction, 
development, turn, and conclusion which started with the 
mysterious defamatory document uproar, there is a possibility 
that the Kodama faction was deeply involved in the recent Naito 
dismissal drama. 
  From here on is only bold inference. However, we think that 
the Kodama faction that had been nervous about birth of a Vice 
Minister Naito was waiting for a chance to overturn prescribed 
personnel changes when the unforeseen collapse of the 1955 rule 
occurred, and a coalition regime substantially controlled by 
Ozawa and Shinseito was born. It was the chance of a lifetime. 
The luck of MITI minister appeared to Kumagai. The scenario 
started from here. 
  Kumagai's aim is "securing the vested interests of 
Shinseito. 
In the political contribution allocation ratio to political 
parties by industry, the steel, auto, and electric power 
industries, which are called the three great families, stand 
side by side. The decision on the percentages by the three great 
families is made from January to February every year. The 
maximum influence should be exerted on the industry directly 
before that" (political source). 
  Naito was the target. They would fire Mister MITI. The 
effect 
would be tremendous and there would be merits for both sides. 
What they miscalculated, however, was that there was no decisive 
scandal about Naito. Therefore, they put the Tanahashi scandal 
on Naito. So, on that fateful day, 16 December 1993, Kumagai 
gave Naito advice to resign.... 
  Of course, this is not outside the realm of conjecture. 
  However, the voices of Ozawa's Shinseito about this tumult 
in 
Kasumigaseki have overwhelmingly been, "It is a warning and 
threat to us." It is no reason just to fire him. If that is the 
case, the recent uproar has become the greatest scheme in 
Kasumigaseki executed in the name of "bureaucratic reform." 
  On 1 January 1994, Kumano made an appearance at the prime 
minister's official residence. He was accompanied by his wife 
and paid a New Year's greetings to the prime minister. 
  "In a normal year, all the Kasumigaseki vice ministers and 
wives come to the official residence. This year, however, 
everyone hesitated because of the tumult over Naito's sacking at 
the end of 1993, and the vice ministers refrained from making 
New Year's greetings to keep their distance from politics. It 
was surprising that Kumano came. He was the only vice minister 
that came" (official residence beat reporter). 
  Kumano was said to have been happy, looking askance at this 
atmosphere in Kasumigaseki. 
  Then, on 6 January, "Minister Kumagai, accompanied by 
Director Takashima, met Ichiro Ozawa at a restaurant in the 
city. An executive of Itochu was present there, and according to 
him, Director Takashima was in unusually high spirits and 
talkative" (MITI former official). 
  The new year without Naito was probably the beginning of a 
happy lot for the Kodama faction. 
  Meanwhile, however, the irritation at MITI was becoming 
bigger. 
  "Consultation for `wanting to resign' by younger career men 
is growing because of the criticism and feeling of despair about 
the recent uproar. Criticism against the Takashima group has 
appeared in the ministry" (MITI source). 
  Voices such as "dismantle MITI and establish a Resources and 
Energy Ministry" are heard from other government agencies. MITI 
has suffered its biggest crisis since the war. 
  The appearance of two mysterious defamatory documents during 
the recent tumult was previously mentioned. However, another 
mysterious defamatory document which should be called phantasmal 
exists. It was distributed around September 1992, and for some 
reason, this was said to have collected and put lid on it. Why 
was a lid put on it? 
  This document, entitled "Suspicious Issues Concerning a 
Previous MITI Administrative Vice Minister," comprised six 
items, and "suspicions of backdoor money concerning the Japan 
Keirin Association" were pointed out. When we pursued this 
issue, some strange information gushed forth, and from among 
that, the company IBC, Ltd. surfaced. When inquiring about this 
company, however, several MITI bureaucrats said, "That is 
Takashima's company." 
  On the occasion of establishing the company, Takashima and 
Nakano and Isayama who are his juniors seemed to have put 
considerable effort in the related section. 
  The brunt of the suspicions on the Japan Keirin Association 
backdoor money noted in the mysterious defamatory document 
pursuing Tanahashi conversely are directed to the people in the 
anti-Tanahashi faction. That is probably the reason that this 
mysterious defamatory document was sealed. 
  IBC is a mysterious company. 
  It is well known that the the Japan Keirin Association 
transfers about 3 to 5 percent of the sales for bicycle racing 
to public corporations. A MITI source says, "Accounting is 
rigorously checked by the Vehicle Races Council. It is in full 
view." 
  On the other hand, however, there are voices saying that 
"the 
Japan Keirin Association is MITI's moneybag, so to speak." 
  It is said that "In the office regulations at MITI, 
government offices will look after employees until they are 70 
years old. A system for taking care of them has been created so 
that when MITI bureaucrats assigned to related public 
corporations after retirement, money is given from the Japan 
Keirin Association to their destined corporation to help with 
the meager salary" (MITI career man). 
  In other words, although the check is rigorous when money is 
transferred from the Japan Keirin Association to the public 
corporations, there probably are various methods for the way 
that it is used after that. 
<H5>  Unexpected Networks one After the Other </H5>
  The money from the Japan Keirin Association flows into IBC. 
There are suspicious that the system where money of the Japan 
Keirin Association flows to individuals through corporations, 
which the aforementioned MITI career man pointed out, is applied 
here. 
  In order to understand this IBC, we find our way to a 
company 
called TeleJapan International (hereafter, TeleJapan), which 
should be called its predecessor, and here again, an 
anti-Tanahashi faction surfaces. Toshiko Tsuji, who has been 
called "political and bureaucratic wirepuller" or "patron of 
bureaucrats," is involved in the company called TeleJapan. Tsuji 
is the daughter of that fixer, Kiroku Tsuji, who drew the 
capital for founding the Liberal Party, predecessor of the LDP, 
from Yoshio Kodama. 
  Takashima, Isayama and all go in and out of Tsuji's office 
which is in Bicycle Kaikan Building, and "Not just MITI, but 
elite MOF bureaucrats, all visit Tsuji. At MITI, currently 
Director Takashima is said to be the central member" (a 
bureaucrat). It can be said that Tsuji still has a fixer-type 
existence which boasts hidden power. 
  The TeleJapan was established in 1982, and "it was created 
by 
Dentsu and Nippon Shineseru, each with a 50 percent investment 
ratio, with MITI leading the chorus and influenced industry" 
(person concerned at the time). 
  The president is a person called Junichi Kiyonaga. 
  Tsuji substantially controls this Nippon Shineseru and it is 
a company that is jointly managed with Kiyonaga. Incidentally, 
Kiyonaga is the husband of actress Shio Fujimura and former 
private secretary of Yasujiro Tsutsumi, Seibu Group founder. The 
business is movie production and PR [public relations]. 
  First, let's touch on a part of the relationship between the 
company and MITI. 
  For example, 94 of the 96 videos ordered by the Agency of 
Industrial Science and Technology from fiscal 1980 to fiscal 
1988 were made by Nippon Shineseru. (See "Government and 
Government Related Agencies Foreign Language PR Film and Video 
List.") 
  Furthermore, "if the people of Nippon Shineseru are refused 
business by a company, a call immediately comes from MITI. `We 
hear that you refused them, is that true?' They are so blunt" 
(other production company). 
  Moreover, a bureaucrat says, "I received Shio Fujimura dance 
tickets from Nippon Shineseru, so I went to the theater. When 
turn about to look, to my surprise, the threater was the heads 
of MITI bureaucrats and their wives line the place." 
  At the time of its establishment, MITI was prompted by the 
necessity of PR and lobby activities for the United States. 
Therefore, TeleJapan was created and the plan was to develop 
activities with money flowing in from industrial groups. 
  However, it was held up because of a fight over interests 
with MOFA. Ultimately, a system of cooperation was created 
whereby the money from industry groups entered a MOFA-related 
group once, and after a certain percentage was paid for activity 
costs, it flowed intact to TeleJapan. 
  This MOFA-related group was no more than a window for 
accepting capital. 
  According to people concerned at the time, the annual budget 
was about 1 billion yen. The capital was supplied by the auto 
industry, electrical-related, or the Japan Machinery Industry 
Federation, etc., and "millions of yen annually" (person 
concerned at the time) from the Japan Keirin Association came in 
through the Japan Machinery Industry Federation. 
  However, the use of this about 1 billion yen which came in 
every year without doing anything is not understood very well. 
This money is said to have been used to the fullest. 
  While there are people who say, "Production of videos for PR 
use was done and it was all in full view of the public," there 
is a person concerned at the time who says, "It seems to have 
had a money laundering aspect for money which government 
officials could not use publicly. 
  That TeleJapan entered a sabbatical state in 1990 because of 
trouble in the United States. At the same time, IBC was 
established with Hiroshi Yomo, a former newspaper reporter in a 
Kiyonaga-related company, as the substantially responsible 
person and senior managing director. 
  The configuration was creation of the IBCC (International 
Business Communication Council) a voluntary group with the 
Automobile Industry Association, Electronic Industries 
Association of Japan, and Japan Machinery Industry Federation, 
etc., as members, the influx of money from the members there, 
and entry into IBC. You might say that both are one body and the 
group is simply no more than a tunnel existence for passing 
money. Moreover, about 250 million in money from the Japan 
Keirin Association came in through the Japan Machinery Industry 
Federation. It is exactly the same system as TeleJapan. The 
annual budget is about 700 million yen. This enters IBC without 
doing anything and it uses up all that money. 
  However, it is not clear what it does. It is called 
"overseas business communication business," (Japan Machinery 
Industry Federation source). Upon investigating, we found that 
it contributes to welfare groups of the United States or hold 
journalist symposiums. It irregularly sends out bulletins and 
newsletters from the United States to its members, but to be 
honest, these are of poor quality. Also it has a branch office 
on first class land in New York. While saying it is 
communications business with abroad, Yomo, the substantially 
responsible person, cannot speak English. It has only 13 
employees and yet it uses up about 700 million yen every year. 
It is a strange company. 
  "When they closed TeleJapan after it became embroiled in 
trouble, MITI wanted to keep something similar to a TeleJapan. 
So, they established IBC. (TeleJapan source) 
  Yomo, of course, denies this and says that there is no MITI 
involvement at all. However, a MITI bureaucrat says, "We are 
participating in everything, from budget allocations, etc." 
What is this? 
  Speaking in regards to Takashima, people say that he lives 
in 
grand style. He lives by renting an ultra-high class apartment 
at Shoto in Shibuya Ward, Tokyo where "house rent is about 1.5 
million yen. If it were the Bubble era, it would be 2 million 
yen" (realtor remark) and takes subordinates to high class 
restaurants, paying the bills on the spot. 
  However, about two or three years ago, he was said to have 
been complaining to a superior, saying that "I must purchase a 
condo because I have to look after my mother, but I do not have 
the money." 
  It is a fact that in the deputy vice minister personnel 
change, which was the start of Takashima's hatred of Tanahashi 
and Naito, one of the former top level official vigorously 
opposed, saying that "Takashima as deputy vice minister is 
absolutely no good. A money scandal will surface." 
  In the ministry now, various information is running wild, 
and 
the untransparent portions of MITI are being brought to light. 
  Why was Director Naito of the Industrial Policy Bureau 
forced 
to resign? 
  We have asked Minister Kumagai, key persons of the Kodama 
faction from Vice Minister Kumano and on down, and former 
officials for information; however, they have all not complied 
with our request. Answers are escaping still far away. 
  When one considers it, bureaucratic reform has formed the 
nucleus of the policy vision worked out by Ichiro Ozawa. It is 
true that the bureaucratic kingdom of Japan is demanded of 
restructuring. The advice for Director Naito of the Industrial 
Policy Bureau to resign is believed to be the first step. 
However, not even looking at the facts of the recent tumult, 
this has destroyed the point that distinguishes politics from 
bureaucracy and even smashed the basic rules that bureaucrats 
execute administration by fairly maintaining political 
neutrality. 
  Naito, who has been called as Mr. MITI, is to leave Japan 
for 
a while and is to become a visiting professor at Georgetown 
University in the United States. He was, perhaps, a bureaucrat 
who was caught up in an unexpected storm of the collapse of the 
1955 rule.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Must Clear Up Slip-up on Burma'] </F>
  [Text] The call by a senior American policy-maker for 
increased U.S. ties with Burma needs to be quickly dismissed 
before it is mistaken for an actual Washington plan. State 
Department Counselor Tim Wirth's proposal to reverse U.S. action 
and widen contacts with Rangoon is badly misguided. His senior 
rank among U.S. officials lends unwarranted emphasis to his call 
for a new American policy on Burma. U.S. direction on Asian 
relations has recently come under internal fire from major 
Clinton administration officials. Mr Wirth's sudden and 
confusing recommendation for reversal of a stable Burma policy 
needs to be quickly clarified. 
  Mr Wirth is a former U.S. senator, with acknowledged 
expertise on narcotics matters. In an interview with the REUTER 
news agency last week, he recommended "more dialogue" between 
Washington and the Rangoon junta. Without providing details, Mr 
Wirth said such contact would reduce a huge outflow of heroin to 
the United States and other countries. He recommended ignoring 
the continuing and massive repression of Burmese in favor of his 
emphasis on the drugs problem. "I'm thinking of young people on 
the streets of the United States of America who are directly 
impacted by that," he told his interviewer. "That should be our 
priority." 
  Not even our own government's policy of "constructive 
engagement" is as cynical as Mr Wirth's proposal. The U.S. 
official's proposal would completely overlook the massive and 
violent abuses of Burmese citizens; At least the Thai -- and 
ASEAN -- approaches to Rangoon aim at reversing repression by 
the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Mr Wirth, 
as a former politician, may feel he still must serve an 
exclusively American population. The only satisfaction we can 
draw is from a fellow official in the State Department who said 
Mr Wirth's proposal was "unlikely to be met with much 
enthusiasm." 
  Available evidence shows SLORC has neither the desire nor 
the 
ability to launch an effective anti-narcotics program. SLORC 
leader Lt Gen Khin Nyunt claimed last January his regime would 
move against narcotics peddling. The reality has been the 
opposite. An alleged military attack on warlord Khun Sa 
evaporated two months ago without a single gain. Opium growing 
and heroin refining continues to grow in northern Burma. SLORC 
has shown no commitment to combat such growth. In addition, 
troubling reports of direct links between narcotics dealers and 
SLORC officials continue unabated. 
  The proposal to put Rangoon and Washington on an equal 
diplomatic footing is misguided. Since it took power in 1988 
over the bodies of thousands of dead citizens, SLORC has shown 
few signs of compassion. For five years, it has kept its 
best-known and most peaceful citizen imprisoned at home. Aung 
San Suu Kyi said in a recent interview she remains determined to 
continue her struggle for a democratic Burma. The world's only 
superpower should do no less. 
  There may be no absolutes in diplomatic affairs. But the 
lack of goodwill from SLORC is clear. Mr Wirth's proposal to 
give status to the Rangoon junta in the mere hope it might 
respond is misguided. SLORC has had many years and opportunities 
to improve its image through direct action. Instead, it has 
continued one of the most repressive systems of governments of 
our day. There are several opinions and policies about how to 
change this. Mr Wirth's proposal merely to overlook them and to 
have faith that heroin exports will decline is a major act of 
faith. Beside this, the Thai government's hope that a slow 
increase in economic and diplomatic relations will encourage an 
easing of SLORC's tyranny seems like a paragon. 
  The chief U.S. policy-maker for Asian affairs, Winston Lord, 
complained last week that U.S.-Asian relations have been sliding 
for the past six months. The confusing statement from Mr Wirth 
tends to back up this claim. United States policy towards Burma 
has been clear, and firm, since 1988. Indeed, Mr Lord himself 
said a week ago that Washington intended to continue to disagree 
with ASEAN on the matter. "The United States wants Burma 
isolated while ASEAN is pursuing a policy of engagement," he 
said. If Washington is going to change this policy, it owes its 
allies a clear warning. If, as it should, the U.S. intends to 
continue to press SLORC for change, it must make this clear. Mr 
Wirth's statement has caused confusion. The Clinton 
administration should clear it up quickly.

  [Text] The Cabinet has approved a plan to buy two 
second-hand frigates, each worth Btl.5 billion, Defense Minister 
Wichit Sukmak said yesterday. 
  Wichit said that the Navy initially would purchase only one 
frigate as Thailand and the US still had to discuss details such 
as expenses for training crews and providing weapons on the 
ships. 
  "We have to thoroughly check everything first," he said. 
  Wichit said the frigates would be bought under a 
hire-purchase arrangement, which was considerably cheaper than 
buying new ships at BtlO billion each. 
  The hire-purchase agreement will take effect in 1995 under a 
contract which has to be renewed every five years. Wichit said 
that the Navy would stop payments after the frigates reached 75 
per cent of their life-span. 
  Meanwhile, commenting a report that the military was unhappy 
with its tight budget allocation, Wichit said that military 
accountants were trying to operate in line with government 
policy. 
  "We will spend on things which need prime attention first. 
However, we can ask the government to increase the budget if 
necessary," he said, adding that the final decision rested with 
the government. 
  Wichit conceded, however, that the budget restrictions would 
have some effect on the military structure. He stressed that 
the main duty of the armed forces was to protect the country. 
He added that an intelligence centre was crucial to the 
successful performance of the military.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Commenting to newsmen about 
the clash between Cambodian Government and foreign forces and 
the Cambodian remark that the foreign force was Thai, Army 
Commander General Wimon Wongwanit said the Cambodian side made 
such a claim to justify the reality that the Cambodian force has 
not been able to defeat the Khmer Rouge. Another motive of the 
claim is to appeal for various kinds of international support. 
He said the Army has always asserted that it will not interfere 
in Cambodian internal affairs because Thailand wants to see 
peace in Cambodia.

  [Text] The Army has denied that "foreign" troops killed and 
captured by Cambodian government forces during recent fighting 
with the Khmer Rouge [KR] were Thai soldiers. 
  It also denied providing any assistance to the Khmer Rouge 
and warned that it is running out of patience with Phnom Penh 
over repeated accusations of Thai military involvement with the 
guerrillas. 
  Army spokesman Col Phalangkun Klahan said that despite the 
Army's policy of non-interference in the Cambodian conflict it 
has often been accused of collaborating with the Khmer Rouge, in 
particular whenever Phnom Penh suffers a reversal on the 
battlefield. 
  He reiterated Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit's 
insistence that no Thai paramilitary forces or troops were 
involved in the fighting in Cambodia. Thailand would gain no 
benefit by supporting the Khmer Rouge. 
  The spokesman questioned the efficiency of the Cambodian 
intelligence network. If it kept feeding wrong information to 
the government then victory would be extremely difficult for the 
Cambodian army. 
  Phalangkun said the Army is keeping a close watch on Agence 
France Presse, the French news agency which has been publishing 
allegations of Thai military involvement in Cambodia. 
  The agency most recently quoted the Cambodian Information 
Ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse as saying that the government 
troops had killed and captured "several foreigners" dressed in 
black who were fighting on the side of the Khmer Rouge in the 
northwest. 
  While Sieng refused to say where they were being held, what 
languages they spoke or what kind of role they played in the 
fighting, he remarked: "I believe certain Thais wear black", a 
veiled reference to the Thai Ranger unit that patrols the border 
with Cambodia, said AFP. 
  Phalangkun said the AFP offices in Bangkok and Hong Kong 
were 
understanding when the Army tried to clarify Thailand's position 
on Cambodian affairs, but there had been no response from the 
AFP bureau in Phnom Penh. 
  He said the Cambodian conflict has placed the Army in a 
difficult position for over a decade and warned that Thai 
patience was running out. Thailand, he added, wants a national 
reconciliation and an end to the fighting in Cambodia. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday refused to 
comment 
on a statement by Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk that Phnom 
Penh might approach foreign countries for military assistance. 
  "You should ask the countries which were mentioned by King 
Sihanouk," the minister told reporters. 
  He also would not comment on the possible affect of foreign 
assistance on Thailand's border security. 
  "I do not want to talk about it," he replied vehemently. 
  King Sihanouk on Wednesday said he might be forced to seek 
military help from the United States, France or Australia if the 
Khmer Rouge continued its war to partition the country. 
  On Tuesday Prasong warned against outside interference in 
Cambodia. He said he had made his feelings clear during a 
meeting with US Deputy Chief of Staff Adm Williams Owens on 
Monday, and would also convey them to the Australian and French 
governments. 
  Gen Charan Kunlawanit, chief of the National Security 
Council, said both Laos and Vietnam had previously rejected 
Phnom Penh's requests for arms. 
  Thailand shared the ASEAN policy of not assisting any of the 
disputing parties in Cambodia and saw arms supplies as a 
"militant measure" which supported homicide. 
  Bangkok wanted to provide humanitarian assistance, which 
would improve the living conditions of the general populace. 
  He said he did not believe that King Sihanouk, as head of 
state and a "popular world leader", would ask foreigners to 
assist in the killing of his own people. 
  The Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh, meanwhile, has made 
preparations to evacuate Thais living in Battambang and Sisophon 
if the military situation in the area worsens, the Foreign 
Ministry announced. A representative of the embassy yesterday 
called on Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut to 
express the government's concern for the safety of Thais there, 
and asked for cooperation in the event of an air evacuation. 
  The statement said there were believed to be 28 Thais still 
in Battambang.

  [Text] National Security Council [NSC] Deputy Secretary 
General Khachatphai Burutphat yesterday urged the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] to speed up repatriation 
of Laotians by setting up more reception centres in Laos. 
  "It is up to the UNHCR to speed up the repatriation of 
Laotians, not to allow it to drag on as at present," Mr. 
Khachatphai said. 
  The UNHCR "succeeded to repatriate some 300,000 Cambodians 
in 
one year," he said. "There are now only an estimated 25,000 
Laotians left in Thailand and they want to go home." 
  The setting up of more reception centres in Laos would speed 
up the repatriation process and support Thailand's plan to close 
the last refugee camp for Laotians by the end of this year. 
  There are two reception centres in Laos, in Vientiane and 
the 
southern province of Savannakhet. In last week's repatriation 
movement, a group of 442 Hmongs from the last Thai camp at Ban 
Napho in Nakhon Phanom province went to the reception centre of 
Hatsaifong in Vientiane. 
  The NSC deputy secretary expressed confidence that the UNHCR 
would receive financial support from private donors. The 
remaining Laotians were a comparativeIy small number, he said. 
  Laos is trying to speed up development and has achieved 
economic growth of no less than six-seven percent a year in the 
past three years.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Sabotage the People's Faith"] </F>
  [Text] Four Islamic teachers were recently arrested in 
Songkhla Province's Chana District on several charges, including 
rebellion. Police authorities told a subsequent news conference 
they believe the accused are responsible for the bombing 
incidents that have taken place in different places in Songkhla, 
Pattani, and Narathiwat Provinces over the past two years. The 
worst of these incidents was the explosion at the railway 
station in Hat Yai District where three people were killed and 
seventy others injured. 
  During the arrests the police gathered more evidence -- 
including firearms and documents in foreign languages -- with 
which to incriminate the four preachers. The accused deny the 
charges, however, insisting that they have no connection with 
the movement responsible for those terrorist activities, which 
were designed to show off to some Middle Eastern countries and 
hence draw their assistance. 
  All four teachers are reportedly graduates from schools in 
the Middle East. Police authorities are still looking for their 
accomplices; some have reportedly fled and taken refuge in 
Malaysia. 
  It should be noted that the authorities have no evidence to 
link the four preachers to last year's torching of 35 schools in 
the four southern provinces. Some suspected arsonists have 
already been arrested, but the investigation has made very 
little progress. 
  The authorities were very careful in handling this case. The 
presence of senior police officers and the governor of Songkhla 
Province during the arrest of the four was an indication that 
the authorities must have sufficient evidence. The detention of 
the four preachers, though, has caused suspicion and resentment 
among some local Muslims as well as their students, who are very 
likely to hold a protest rally. Hopefully, such a rally will be 
peaceful, allowing justice to take its course. In any event, at 
this point the accused are still innocent because a court has 
not found them guilty. 
  We believe the arrests are a manifestation of the 
authorities' determination to punish the culprits and will serve 
to inform the general public about the Interior Ministry's 
endeavors in this particular case. Unlike the school arsons, 
the Interior Ministry has made progress. 
  We firmly believe that if the suspects have not committed 
the 
crimes they are accused of, the court of justice will set them 
free. The court's decision will depend entirely on the evidence 
both sides present during the trial. We therefore appeal to 
people who disagree with the arrest of the four suspects to be 
patient until the trial. We also appeal to the authorities to 
make sure they have sufficient evidence before they take anyone 
into custody, because they are playing with other people's 
freedom and could sabotage the people's faith in government.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Fresh Cambodian Elections Will Never Defeat the </F>
KR"] 
  [Text] King Norodom Sihanouk's call last week for fresh 
general elections appears to be more an expression of his utter 
desperation about the situation in his war-blighted country than 
a viable plan for peace. 
  Speaking to a group of monks on Thursday the monarch said 
that the rebel Khmer Rouge, who refused to recognize the results 
of UN sponsored polls last year, should be willing to test their 
popularity in a democratic poll if they are truly 
representatives of the people. 
  The current leaders "are all sportsmen, so they must agree 
... Then we can compete with each other through peaceful means. 
There will be no killing of each other, but we can attack each 
other through microphones," the king said. 
  But in Cambodia elections are a blood sport. The country has 
no history of peaceful transfer of power and no tradition of 
parliamentary opposition. Like the Khmer Rouge now, the losers 
in any battle for power have traditionally taken their struggle 
to the jungle and there is nothing to suggest anything would 
change if polls were held. 
  Even with 23,000 UN soldiers and officials monitoring last 
year's polls, the election campaign proceeded under a climate of 
fear. Scores of candidates and canvassers were gunned down, 
voters intimidated, and ethnic Vietnamese massacred to make a 
political point. And then when the ballots were tallied, the 
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) threatened to take a large 
portion of the country and secede when it became apparent the 
royalist Funcinpec [National United Front for an Independent, 
Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party would win. 
  The CPP and Funcinpec have since ruled in an uneasy 
coalition 
but much suspicion and acrimony remains. With much of Cambodia 
currently under threat from the Khmer Rouge insurgency, the 
timing couldn't be worse for the holding of a new election. 
  Much of the blame for the current mess in Cambodia must rest 
with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia 
(Untac) for failing to disarm the four warring factions as was 
required by the 1991 Paris Peace Accord. 
  Untac military chief Lt Gen John Sanderson argued that to 
have used force to disarm the Khmer Rouge would have breached 
the mission's peacekeeping mandate. What's more, he said, it 
would have been martial folly in the jungles of Cambodia. 
  But now with the Khmer Rouge threatening to impose a reign 
of 
terror over much of the northwest, the entire 
three-billion-dollar peace mission is beginning to look like 
folly. 
  By allowing the Khmer Rouge to remain armed, dangerous and 
outside the peace process, left behind a dangerous legacy for 
the new government. It also meant Untac was never able carry 
out another crucial provision of the peace accord -- the 
establishment of a new national army. 
  The United Nations cannot be blamed for the Royal Cambodian 
Army's recent crushing defeats at the hands of the guerrillas at 
Anlung Veng and Pailin. But the prospects for Cambodia's 
post-election future would have been much brighter if even a 
modestly trained and functioning army had been up and running 
when Untac pulled out. 
  As things now stand, it appears that if Phnom Penh is ever 
to 
overcome the Khmer Rouge threat, constant military pressure is 
going to have to be applied. 
  The guerrillas have shown no sign of sincere interest in 
King 
Sihanouk's earlier peace initiative which would have given 
acceptable members of the group positions in power in exchange 
for an end to their insurgency. Instead, the group's leaders 
continue to respond to government overtures with their 
anachronistic rantings about "the Vietnamese puppets, their 
lackies and the entente." 
  The Khmer Rouge have demonstrated over and over again they 
have no interest in participating in the rebuilding of Cambodia 
along democratic principals. Should they accept an invitation 
to join the elections there is no reason to believe they would 
campaign peacefully or abide by the results. 
  In last year's election, the real heroes were not the UN 
organizers but the voters who in great numbers defied threats of 
violence and death to cast ballots for their chosen party. But 
asking the Cambodians to take such a risk again under the 
current conditions would be to ask too much. 
  The UN tried valiantly to introduce democratic concepts to 
Cambodia as it steered the country towards elections. 
  But in Cambodia, it is the law of power that has always 
ruled 
and the only precept the Khmer Rouge responds to. Unfortunately 
for the new government in Phnom Penh, its army seems ineptly-led 
and ridden with corruption. 
  The international community would be right to respond to 
Cambodia's appeals for assistance to help train its military. 
  Elections, even those cleanly held, won't defeat the Khmer 
Rouge. Only force coupled with programs to better the lot of the 
population will finally rid Cambodia of this curse.

  [Text] Artillery shells landed on the Thai side of the 
border during fierce fighting in western Cambodia yesterday 
morning, according to Thai military sources. 
  The Phnom Penh force led by 12th Division commander Gen Lai 
Virak deployed troops and six T-54 tanks against the Khmer 
Rouge's 450th Division which has its stronghold on Phnum Malai 
Hill. 
  The fighting took place about five kilometer from Poipet, a 
town bordering Ban Nong Ian, 15 kilometers southeast of 
Aranyaprathet. 
  On Sunday, the Burapha Task Force fired four M-81 mortar 
warning shots after artillery shells crossed the border. No 
casualties were reported. 
  The task force is considering revising its strategy in an 
attempt to pressure Khmer Rouge guerrillas to pull out from 
border areas. 
  In another development, Khmer Rouge forces launched a series 
of attacks on the villages near Highway Route 5, about 15 
kilometers southwest of Sisophon. 
  The guerrillas set fire to more than 150 houses, sending 
almost 1,000 villagers fleeing into Banteay Meanchey province 
where about 15,000 people from many war-affected zones have 
sought refuge. 
  Highway Route 5 linking Poipet and Sisophon is unsafe for 
passage as fear looms over the possibility of KR guerrillas 
ambush.

  [Text] Heavy fighting broke out on the Cambodian side of 
the border yesterday when Phnom Penh forces attacked the Khmer 
Rouge stronghold on Phnum Malai mountain. 
  Some six T-54 tanks and over 500 troops from the 12th 
Division and units of the Fifth Army Region led by commander Lai 
Vira, launched the attack on the Khmer Rouge's 450th Division 
led by Commander Sok Piap. 
  The area being attacked is opposite Thailand's Ban Laem Nong 
Eam which is 15 kilometers southeast of Aranyaprathet. It is 
about six kilometers from Poipet. 
  There were reports of hand to hand fighting from 9.00 a.m. 
and by 9.00 p.m. heavy fighting was still raging near Hill 25. 
  Thai villagers in the south of Aranyaprathet spent the night 
in bunkers as artillery shells continuously peppered the Thai 
side of the border. 
  [Bangkok SUNDAY NATION in English 8 May in a similar report 
on page A2 adds: "About 20 Cambodian government troops crossed 
the border into Sa Kaeo province yesterday during a fierce fight 
with Khmer Rouge guerrillas. They were sent back by border 
patrol police. The fight, involving heavy weapons, took place 
on the Cambodian side opposite Khok Tabaeng village in 
Aranyaprathet district."]

  [Text] Government leaders yesterday said they agreed to a 
proposal by anti-narcotics officials to introduce money 
laundering law provided it did not constitute an infringement on 
the freedom of the individual. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he approved of the idea in 
principle because a money laundering law would prevent dishonest 
people from converting their ill-gotten wealth into legal 
currency. 
  "In principle, the idea of preventing money laundering 
should 
do no harm to society. But we have to look into details of the 
proposed law to see whether the freedom of the individual would 
be compromised in the process," Chuan said. 
  The prime minister said the Office of the Narcotics Control 
Board (ONCB) had yet to submit its proposed anti-money 
laundering legislation to the Cabinet. 
  On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said he 
approved of the proposed law in view of complaints by anti-drug 
officials that, without such a law, drug traffickers would 
continue to flourish from their illegal trade. 
  ONCB officials say many major traders in illicit drugs are 
beyond the reach of the law because law enforcement officials 
normally do not have hard evidence to link them to the crime. 
They say a money laundering law would make it much more 
difficult for drug traffickers to convert drug proceeds into 
legal assets. 
  The government's support for the idea came after it was 
alleged that at least eight MPs were involved in the trade of 
marijuana. 
  Nakhon Phanom MP Thanong Siriprichaphong has been accused by 
the United States' Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) of involvement 
in the shipment of 45 tonnes of marijuana to the United States 
between 1977-87. His assets in the United States -- a house and 
a luxury car -- have been seized under an order by a district 
court in California although US law enforcement officials have 
yet to formally charge him with any crime. 
  Chuan, asked to comment on reports about a thesis written by 
an ONCB investigator which says eight MPs were involved in the 
marijuana trade, said he had seen the document, which lists 
certain lawmakers among other suspected drug traffickers. 
  But the prime minister added that there was "no hard and 
fast 
evidence. Some of them closely linked to local influential 
people or those who are suspected of involvement in drug 
trafficking." 
  He said he was told by ONCB officials that they could not 
find enough evidence to initiate legal action against most 
people on the list of suspected drug traffickers. 
  Chuan said he had instructed ONCB officials to take action 
without fear against anyone involved in the illegal drug trade 
as long as there was sufficient evidence. 
  Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said he agreed that 
Thailand should have a money laundering law which would help 
anti- drug officials fight drug dealers more effectively.

  [Text] Burma is ready to open the country to foreign 
tourists in 1996, with the number of visitors per year targeted 
at 50,000 from the year 2000 onward, said the Thai Ambassador to 
Burma, Wira Futrakun. 
  He said Thailand is happy to be the gateway for visitors 
wishing to visit that country. 
  The Burmese government has signed a contract with a Thai 
company to invest in accommodation in Burma. A number of hotel 
projects financed by foreign investors are underway to cope with 
the growing number of tourists. 
  Two first-class hotels are scheduled to be built in Pagan 
and 
another in Ranong, the ambassador said. 
  Thai Airways International's flight frequencies will also be 
given a boost provided agreement with the Burmese government is 
reached. There is now in effect a plan to double the length of 
stay for visitors from two to four weeks. 
  The Burmese government also proposed to grant "visas on 
arrival" to tourists travelling to the old capital of Mandalay, 
Mr Wira said. 
  The foreign visitors, however, have to pay US S300 to 
purchase coupons which can be redeemed for accommodation and 
other service facilities in place of money, said the Thai 
ambassador.

  [Text] Banhan Sinlapa-acha was yesterday elected leader of 
the Chat Thai Party, formally ending the long power tussle with 
his predecessor, party founder Praman Adireksan. 
  Praman was moved to the ceremonial post of party president, 
as earlier agreed between his small group of supporters and 
Banhan's powerful faction. The post of president was created 
recently just for Praman. 
  The elections, held during a party assembly at the Siam City 
Hotel, in Bangkok, also saw Sano Thianthong appointed Chat Thai 
secretary-general, replacing Banhan. New deputy party leaders, 
eight altogether, include Bun-ua Prasoetsuwan, Thawit 
Klinprathum, Watthana Atsawahem, and Praman's son Pongphon 
Adireksan. Prathuang Wichanpricha was made party spokesman. 
  Banhan, a Suphan Buri MP, is the first non-member of the 
Ratchakhru clan to rise to the helm of Chat Thai which was 
formed 20 years ago. 
  After learning the result of the election, Banhan told 
reporters he would adhere to the policies laid down by previous 
leaders. 
  Chat Thai, which has no House seats in Bangkok, would try to 
penetrate the city political stronghold -- dominated by Phalang 
Tham and the Democrats -- during the next general election. 
  "If Chat Thai wins some seats in Bangkok, it means that 
Bangkokians accept us as working for the country," Banhan said. 
  Asked whether he had manoeuvred to seize control of Chat 
Thai 
as preparation for the prime ministership, he refused to 
comment, saying it was not the time to talk about it. However 
Sano cut Banhan short telling reporters that the new party 
leader was ready for the job of prime minister. 
  "If he was not ready for the post of prime minister, he 
would 
not have dared to accept the Chat Thai leadership," Sano said. 
  Praman said he was confident Banhan would take good care of 
the party. "I believe he will lead the party out of all kinds 
of trouble," Praman said.

  [Text] President Le Duc Anh has ended a friendship visit 
to Iran. The Iranian foreign minister, Mr. Velayati, was 
interviewed by our radio correspondent in Tehran on this 
occasion. The Iranian foreign minister said the visit to Iran 
by President Le Duc Anh was an important and historical mark of 
relations between the two countries. All meetings and talks 
between the two presidents as well as between ministers of the 
two countries were successful. The two sides agreed to set up 
an intergovernmental committee on economic, 
scientific-technical, cultural, and trade cooperation between 
Vietnam and Iran. 
  Asked by our correspondent on the perspective to promote 
bilateral ties, the Iranian foreign minister said: 
  [Begin Velayati recording in English] As I said to His 
Excellency, the visit of President Anh is considered as a very 
important visit and could be considered as a milestone in our 
bilateral relations. Not only two presidents have had very 
constructive and fruitful talks, but also besides that the 
different ministers from both sides have started to talk in 
different terms about different kinds of cooperation. This 
morning, both presidents have decided to hold the (first 
economic commission) session here and this afternoon, what they 
decided was materialized. It is quite natural that political 
relations mark the first step. Other kinds of relations should 
be based on the political relations. We cannot promote well the 
economic relations without promoting of political relations. So 
one year ago your prime minister came here and that was the 
first visit of a foreign minister of Vietnam to Iran and since 
then both countries have (?wrought out) on the trip of his 
excellency the president to Iran. The most important part of 
discussions which have been held between our two countries has 
been those devoted to the economic relations. So, yes, there is 
a good hope for the promotion of relations and economic 
relations. [end recording]

  [Text] The government has just issued a resolution on 
reforming administrative procedures. The resolution said that 
administrative procedures, especially those related to resolving 
the problems of citizens and organizations, problems are not 
uniform and sometimes cumbersome. It said that responsible 
agencies trend to arbitrarily resolve these problems by focusing 
on their conveniences rather than paying attention to the 
people's interests and aspirations. 
  The resolution stressed that many state organizations have 
incorrectly implemented regulations on receiving and resolving 
complaints while adopting an attitude of deferring work to other 
agencies. This has resulted in a stalemate. Some agencies even 
establish procedures and fees in an arbitrary fashion beyond the 
boundaries of their authority, while others collect fees higher 
than the permissible rate set by the state. Many organizations 
do not make various state administrative procedures public, as 
they fail to train cadres to handle tasks effectively in this 
regard. Many civil servants fail to show courtesy toward the 
people and adopt a self-conceited attitude. Worse still was 
that some even asked for a bribe to help people resolve their 
problems. 
  These negative practices have not only wasted time, effort, 
and funds of various agencies and units, but have encouraged 
corruption, created indignation, and diminished confidence in 
the state. As a result, it is necessary for us to urgently 
reform administrative procedures to meet the people's legitimate 
aspiration. It is also an important step in further reforming 
the national administration system. 
  The government resolution set forth eight concrete tasks to 
be implemented in the second quarter, which are aimed at 
fundamental change in resolving work and problems between state 
agencies and other organizations and between state agencies and 
the people, especially in receiving and resolving problems. 
  The government also asked various echelons and agencies to 
strive to urgently improve their work and performances, 
especially members of the cabinet, directors of government 
organizations, chairmen of people's committees of provinces and 
municipalities directly subordinate to the central government, 
ministers, deputy ministers, and organizations at ministerial 
level.

groups of co-operating militarily with opium warlord Khun Sa and 
warned that such an association "can hinder" continuing peace 
talks. 
  Spokesmen for the Karen and Karenni flatly rejected the 
charges as "groundless" accusations aimed at discrediting the 
anti-Rangoon ethnic movement. 
  In an interview yesterday, the Burmese Armed Forces Attache 
in Bangkok, Col Thein Swe, said the Karen National Union (KNU) 
and the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP) had each sent 
a delegation last month to meet Khun Sa. 
  He claimed that a three-member Karenni team led by Deputy 
Chief of Staff Aung Mya subsequently signed a "military 
alliance" with Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army (MTA). 
  Thein Swe said he did not know the contents of the pact but 
suspected they had "probably" agreed not to let a third military 
force pass through territories they respectively control. 
  He accepted that the Burmese army would need to pass through 
the Karenni area to successfully attack the MTA. He said the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc) will launch 
offensives against Khun Sa's forces, but "it is not yet the 
time". 
  The attache also charged that a five-member Karen delegation 
met Khun Sa during April 10-12 and that a KNU landmine expert, 
Lt Col Isaac had taught the MTA how to produce anti-personnel 
mines and helped set up a weapons factory. 
  The MTA's move implied that it was aware of Slorc's pending 
offensive and had taken the preventive measure of planting 
landmines in the likely path of advancing Burmese troops, 
according to Thein Swe. He said such military cooperation with 
Khun Sa "can hinder" negotiations between Slorc and the two 
ethnic groups. 
  Khun Sa's group could not be reached for comment. 
  In separate interviews yesterday, both the Karen and Karenni 
guerrillas agreed they had sent teams to Khun Sa's area in 
southern Shan State, but rejected as "groundless" the 
accusations that they were cooperating militarily with the 
warlord. 
  Khun Sa, or Chang Si-fu in Chinese, controls a narrow strip 
of territory east of the Salween River in southern Shan State 
alongside the Thai border province of Mae Hong Son. 
  Although he claims not to be a drugs trafficker and says he 
only imposes a tax on opium or heroin passing through his 
territory to finance the Shan state's struggle for independence, 
Rangoon and the world community have branded him a drugs baron. 
Despite his denials, US courts have accepted 10 separate 
narcotics-related charges brought against him. 
  A Karenni spokesman who requested anonymity said the KNPP 
delegation's visit was in response to a recent letter purporting 
to be from Khun Sa to three ethnic movements -- Karen, Karenni 
and Mon -- urging them to unite and cooperate politically and 
militarily with him to counter Slorc. 
  The three groups had discussed the letter. It was ambiguous 
and they had been suspicious of its authenticity and wary of 
being used by an outside party. 
  Khun Sa later confirmed that he had sent the letter, he 
added. 
  The Karenni spokesman confirmed that Aung Mya and two other 
KNPP members did go to see Khun Sa to seek clarification. 
  But he rejected Thein Swe's accusations of a "military 
alliance" with Khun Sa as "groundless propaganda," intended to 
"discredit" the Karenni movement. 
  "We, the KNPP, are not stupid. He deals in drugs. How could 
we (reach an agreement with Khun Sa)... If we did, people would 
think that we deal in drugs and we would then lose our political 
objective (Karenni independence)," he said. 
  The Karenni have a policy to continue peace talks with Slorc 
but no date or venue had been agreed on for the next meeting, he 
said. The KNPP was still pressing for the talks to be held 
outside Burma. 
  Likewise, a Karen spokesman while accepting that a 
delegation 
was sent to Khun Sa's area, denied the team was there to teach 
the Mong Tai Army how to produce mines. He said it was 
"possible" that the trip was in response to the warlord's letter 
but he had not seen the letter itself. 
  "Some small officers went there just to see the place. There 
is no agreement whatsoever signed with Khun Sa," he said. 
  Although the Karen have agreed to enter bilateral ceasefire 
talks with Slorc, no meeting has ever taken place. The two 
sides can not agree on a venue as the Karen want the meeting 
outside Burma while Slorc insists that it takes place inside the 
country.

  [Excerpts] Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, chairman of the 
Work Committee for Development of Border Areas and National 
Races and secretary-1 of the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council [SLORC], accompanied by Lt. Gen. Kyaw Ba, minister of 
hotels and tourism; Lt. Gen. Thein Win, minister of transport; 
Brigadier General Myo Thant, minister of information; U Khin 
Maung Thein, minister of energy; U Khin Maung Yin, minister of 
construction; Colonel Kyi Maung, deputy minister of education; 
Colonel Than Zin, deputy minister of health; Col. Tin Hlaing, 
deputy minister of home affairs, U Kyaw Tin, deputy minister of 
agriculture; responsible personnel, and Marie Croft Foster from 
the ABC NEWS AGENCY left Yangon [Rangoon] by military airplane 
this morning. They arrived at Loikaw airport at 0830. [passage 
omitted on welcoming the delegation] 
  The delegation, accompanied by Commander Major General Saw 
Tun, left Loikaw by helicopter and arrived at the Peking Village 
in Pekon Township, Shan State at 0910. Lieutenant Colonel Than 
Htay, commander of the local battalion; Kayan National Leader U 
Gabriel Byan and local residents welcomed the secretary-1, 
ministers, and party. 
  Then the secretary-1 and ministers proceeded to the primary 
school in the village and met with local residents. First, the 
secretary-1 delivered an address at the meeting. In his 
address, he said: The purpose of the visit to Kayah State by 
the delegation consisting of himself, the cabinet ministers, 
commander, regional administrator, and staff officers from the 
departments, is to coordinate on the regional development. 
While SLORC is taking responsibilities of the state, it is also 
undertaking the border areas and national races development 
activities with genuine goodwill by starting projects. He said 
local tranquillity is crucial to undertake the regional 
development programs. That is why, to carry out the regional 
development programs with full capacity, the state government 
has extended the invitation to the armed organizations in the 
jungle to return to the legal fold and to work with the state 
government to undertake the regional development programs. He 
also added that due to the invitation 10 armed organizations in 
the jungle have already returned to the legal fold, and another 
armed group will return to the legal fold tomorrow. So there 
will be a total of 11 groups returned to the legal fold. He 
said: Kayan national leaders in Kayah State understood the 
state government's genuine goodwill and returned to the legal 
fold. They are joining hands and working with the state 
government for the development of their regions. Reasonable 
achievements are also being made. He added that local people 
also have to cooperate and work in unison to continue to carry 
out the regional development programs with momentum. The state 
government will provide the needed assistance. He said: If the 
armed groups in Kayah State return to the legal fold, there will 
be tranquillity in Kayah State, and the state government will be 
able to carry out development programs with increased momentum. 
Local residents also have to join hands and participate in the 
regional development programs. He added national solidarity is 
crucial for the long-termed existence of the union. That is why 
the SLORC is extending the invitation to the armed groups with 
various views that went into the jungle. He also said that if 
all the armed groups in the jungle return to the legal fold and 
the people join hands and work together, then the state will be 
developed rapidly. That is why national people have to cooperate 
and work together under the leadership of the state government 
for the development of the state and for the development of 
Kayah State and its people. [passage omitted on presentations 
by ministers and responsible personnel, Khin Nyunt's remarks on 
regional development programs, and delegation inspecting 
development activities in Loikaw]. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0827 GMT on 9 May identifies 
the 
latest group to return to the legal fold as the "1,800-strong 
Kayan National Peoples Liberation Front (KNLPF)." It reports the 
group signed a cease-fire agreement with the "ruling junta."]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "US-Malaysia: A Better Future"] </F>
  [Text] "When the United States sneezes, the rest of the 
world catches the flu," is one of those rare pieces of wit that 
reveals far more than it presumes to laugh off. Countries feel 
uncomfortable enough about their vulnerability to American 
cultural contagion when it is inadvertent. But when the 
American bug is set forth as an outbreak of deliberate policy, 
they feel more than entitled to expostulate. 
  The expostulations can often seem like rabid 
anti-Americanism, but for many, particularly among the smaller 
countries, it evinces a helpless inability to resist the on-rush 
of American dogma and its policy consequences. This is where 
Washington so often gets it wrong. America asserts the right to 
spread its own gospel simply because it has the best means for 
doing so; while the "flu-prone" nations see their political 
sovereignty and cultural independence threatened by the 
corrosion of the worst incidental and side effects of that 
gospel. 
  It is where America's preaching of its gospel is 
contradicted 
by the cynicism of its own national interests that expostulation 
rises to protest. Nowhere else is that more telling than in 
Asia and Bosnia. In this continent, America's broader aims from 
"engagement", through ramifying trade and business ties, may be 
turned round for the narrow purposes of retaliation. In trade, 
for example, America encourages imports from Asian countries 
only to hold their export market positions hostage to an 
extraneous agenda, such as on democracy, human rights and labour 
standards. It reserves the legislative right in the so-called 
super 301 provision to employ this trade-war option in defiance 
of its GATT avowals. 
  Much of Washington's insensivitiy and dogmatism, however, 
arises from its distance, both literally and metaphorically, 
from those affected by its policies. The meeting between 
President Clinton and Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir 
Mohamed on Saturday showed that when much of this distance is 
physically bridged, considerable space can be found for common 
ground. Part of the reason why that space appears so narrow is 
a matter of attitude and perception. The latter two are too 
often infused by the hubris that comes from America's 
pre-eminent power and position in the global order. 
  "One should try to convince by pointing out right and wrong 
rather than anything which might be interpreted as 
arm-twisting," Dr. Mahathir told Clinton. Developing nations' 
nervousness to American bullying is more than justified by 
recent history. The US, no doubt, would insist that it means 
well and that it is often mispercieved. Misperceptions are the 
first to be brushed away by the cordial and candid meeting of 
leaderships. On Bosnia, for example, Clinton was disscovered to 
be highly sympathetic but added that nations were constrained in 
their power to act. This admission, however, only extenuates 
America's culpability. 
  Clinton has also shown himself to be a considerable 
departure 
from the yankee conservatism of the Bush and Reagan years. 
Responsive rather than antagonistic to the concerns of countries 
such as Malaysia for greater intra-regional economic relations, 
the president has softened the previous hard line on APEC and 
the EAEC. Above all, Clinton has shown that he takes Malaysia 
and its leader seriously. He has respected the right of small 
nations facing the "flu" to berate the sniffling political and 
economic levia than to take some medicine of its own first.

  [Text] The House of Representatives today passed the 1994 
draft constitutional amendment bill by a more than two-thirds 
majority. The draft bill is designed to provide for the 
establishment of a court of appeal and demand that the paramount 
ruler and Malay rulers accept a government advice. As many as 
133 of the 179 MP's voted for the draft bill. Three PAS [Pan 
Malaysian Islamic Party] members and four independents were 
among those voting for the draft bill. Fourteen DAP [Democratic 
Action Party] members abstained and not a single member of the 
Semangat 46 [Spirit of 46 Party] attended the session today. 
  Speaking during the debates at the committee level, 
opposition leader Mr. Lim Kit Siang said that the party 
abstained because the proposed amendment to Article 66 did not 
get the consent of the Council of Rulers as provided for in 
Article 38 (4) of the Federal Constitution. 
  Winding up the debates, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri 
Anwar 
Ibrahim said a constitutional amendment is nothing new and thus 
does not need the consent of the Council of Rulers. He said the 
notice regarding debates over the draft constitutional amendment 
bill was considered sufficient because the matter is nothing new. 
  In another development, Semangat 46 President Tengku 
Razaleigh Hamzah said the government should postpone the 
amendment because Article 40 of the Federal Constitution 
pertains to a true interpretation of a government advice to the 
rulers and their subsequent consent. He said the amendment 
should be studied first before being presented to the Council of 
Rulers for their consent.

Representative Mickey Kantor on its bid to host the first 
ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization [WTO]. Mr. 
Kantor told reporters in Washington the meeting ought to be held 
somewhere else. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said it was up to 
members of the WTO and not the U.S. Trade Representative to 
decide on the venue. The spokesman stressed that Singapore's

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MFA] has welcomed 
the U.S. State Department's clarification that Washington has 
not yet taken a stand on Singapore's bid to host the first World 
Trade Organization [WTO] conference. A Ministry spokesman said 
this in response to queries from the News Five. Singapore had 
expressed regret yesterday after U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor said that the WTO meeting ought to be held 
elsewhere. A State Department spokesman said the U.S. had no 
opinion on whether Singapore should host the conference and that 
Mr. Kantor's comments were his own. The MFA spokesman stressed 
that the Republic's proposal to host the conference still 
stands. WTO members are to decide on the venue for the 
conference.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The head of the government 
tax commission, Kan Kato, blasted Tuesday [10 May] as "strange" 
U.S. criticism of Japanese plans to cut income taxes and raise 
consumption taxes. 
  It is "simplistic" to argue that writing a later consumption 
tax hike into the same legislation that cuts income taxes will 
hurt the economy and erase the boost the tax cut should bring, 
Kato told a regular news conference after a meeting of the 
commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister. "The 
American way of thinking is strange," said Kato, a professor 
emeritus of economics at Keio University. 
  U.S. officials have complained about the idea of linking tax 
cuts and hikes, saying the knowledge of a coming tax hike would 
psychologically cancel the effect of the cut. But Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen recently indicated the United States 
would endorse a linked tax plan if the two measures were 
separated by a "substantial time." 
  Washington wants Tokyo to cut taxes first to boost domestic 
demand and thus curb Japan's huge trade surplus. But fiscal 
conservatives led by the powerful Finance Ministry insist that 
the offsetting financing be locked in before the government cuts 
taxes. 
  Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata vowed to the 
tax 
commission that he will continue his predecessor Morihiro 
Hosokawa's tax overhaul agenda, including "permanent income tax 
cuts." 
  He asked the commission to flesh out its detailed tax 
overhaul report next month as planned, "based on the pillar of 
lessening personal income taxes and fulfilling taxation on 
consumption." 
  Hata renewed Hosokawa's vow of submitting the tax reform 
plan, based on the options proposed by the panel, to parliament 
by the end of next month and enacting the legislation this year, 
with "the cooperation and understanding of the various parties." 
  To meet the panel's deadline, Kato said, the members must 
consolidate the thrust of their proposals by the end of this 
month to allow time for public hearings throughout the country 
before compiling the final June report. 
  Hata asked the panel to "treat the request of former Prime 
Minister Hosokawa as my request." Hosokawa had also said 
Japan's net tax burden must grow to meet the coming needs of the 
nation's graying society. 
  But Kato said a net tax increase has not emerged as a 
consensus view in the panel, although some members favor an 
overall increase in taxation for social welfare spending. 
  Kato also confirmed that some members argue for a multi-rate 
consumption tax, that would tax such necessities as food at a 
lower rate than other items. But he said it has not emerged as 
a formal panel option, as reported Tuesday in the NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata confirmed Tuesday [10 May] that 
Japan and the United States have begun informal talks in a bid 
to resume the stalled trade "framework" negotiations. 
  Japanese trade officials in charge of the framework talks, 
for example, have made contacts with their U.S. counterparts by 
telephone, Hata told a regular press conference. As there is 
little time before the end-of-June target for restarting the 
talks, Japan wants more opportunities for discussion with 
Washington, Hata said. 
  The trade minister previously said Japan wants to use "all 
kinds of communication channels" with the U.S. to pave the way 
for an early reopening of the framework talks, suspended since 
the breakdown in the February summit between then Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  Tokyo and Washington vowed efforts for a breakthrough in the 
suspended trade talks before the July summit of the Group of 
Seven (G-7) leading industrialized nations in Naples. 
  On Japan's assistance to South Africa, Hata said his 
ministry 
is now working to formulate specific aid programs for the 
country.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries said Tuesday [10 May] that quarantine 
measures Washington State has implemented recently to prevent an 
apple disease spreading have cleared Japanese requirements for 
imported apples. 
  Ministry officials said the ministry's on-site inspections 
have found no problems in U.S. quarantine procedures for fire 
blight, a common apple disease. Ministry sources said that as a 
result, a Japanese ban on imports of U.S.-grown apples will be 
lifted from late this year to early next year. 
  Japan has resisted U.S. calls for ending its curbs on 
imports 
of American apples despite decades of U.S. lobbying, citing 
worms and diseases which could spread to contaminate Japanese 
crops.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa pledged to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
on Wednesday [11 May] that Japan will boost support for U.S. 
efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East through aid to 
Palestine, Israel and Arab countries. Kakizawa conveyed the 
message in a telephone conversation, Foreign Ministry officials 
said. 
  Kakizawa praised the U.S. for mediating in bilateral 
negotiations between Israel and Syria. Japan will continue to

Kakizawa said. 
  Christopher praised Japan's positive attitude in supporting 
the Middle East peace process, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- At least 71 Japanese have 
left Yemen by ship and air for Djibouti, but 19 other Japanese 
are still in the strife-torn country, Foreign Ministry officials 
said Tuesday [10 May]. 
  They said the ministry urged the 19 to leave Yemen as soon 
as 
possible. The stranded Japanese nationals are considering 
leaving the country by aircraft of other countries, the 
officials said. 
  The 19 still in Yemen are five employees of 
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co., one Nissho Iwai Corp. 
official, and 13 Japanese Embassy personnel and their dependents. 
  The Japanese Embassy in Sanaa advised Japanese residents and 
tourists to evacuate from the Yemeni capital Saturday, three 
days after the Yemeni Government declared a state of emergency 
because of fighting between northern and southern army units and 
shelling in the capital.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- No Japanese citizens remain 
in the southern part of civil-war-torn Yemen, as the last three 
left the embattled southern city of Aden aboard a French boat 
Monday [9 May], the Foreign Ministry said. The three Japanese, 
a tourist from Fukuroi in Shizuoka Prefecture and an embassy 
personnel stationed in the former southern capital and his wife, 
are on their way across the Gulf of Aden to Djibouti. 
  Northern forces were reported to have almost overrun Aden on 
Monday. 
  In northern Yemen, another 68 Japanese citizens were flown 
out from the capital of Sanaa aboard German and Italian military 
aircraft Monday, following advice from the Japanese Embassy to 
leave as soon as possible. Their arrival in Djibouti could not 
yet be confirmed. 
  Tokyo is still trying to have the remaining 21 Japanese 
residents and tourists evacuated quickly, as hostilities 
continue to grow between rival southern and northern army units. 
They will likely be evacuated by emergency aircraft of other 
nations, government sources said. 
  A total of 16 Japanese, including embassy-related personnel, 
are reportedly in Sanaa with five Japanese in the northern city 
of Mafraq.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- Vietnam desires more 
Japanese investment and is ready to take further steps to 
attract it, a senior representative of a Vietnamese business 
association said Wednesday [11 May]. 
  Doan Ngoc Bong, first vice president of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry of Vietnam, made the remarks to some 200 
Japanese business people at a seminar on investment in Vietnam 
held at the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren). 
He said that as of mid-March, there were 897 licensed foreign 
investment projects, with a combined capital value of 8.47 
billion dollars. 
  With 56 investment projects capitalized at 542 million 
dollars, Japan trailed in fifth place behind Taiwan, Hong Kong, 
Singapore and Australia -- despite its being Vietnam's largest 
trading partner and aid donor. 
  Among the Japanese investments are 26 industrial projects, 
five oil and gas projects, five bottling or canning projects, 
four agriculture or forestry projects, three service sector 
projects, one fisheries project and one housing construction 
project. 
  At a bilateral economic conference held in Ho Chi Minh City 
last month, Japanese investors were invited to put money into 
industrial and export-processing zones as well as such priority 
areas as oil and gas, cement, food processing and manufacturing 
for export. 
  Doan Ngoc Bong said Vietnam also welcomes more investment in 
the form of build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, which Hanoi 
will treat as a special priority. He noted that the speed of 
Vietnam's absorption of foreign investment funds has been rapid, 
rising at an average 52 percent annually. 
  Vietnam received 70 percent as much investment in 1992 as it 
attracted during the previous four years, while the total 
investment in 1993 was 40 percent more than that in 1992, he 
said. But he acknowledged that Vietnam has much to accomplish 
if it is to continue attracting foreign investment in the face 
of increasing competition from other countries in the region. 
  Among impediments that have been cited by potential 
investors 
are the country's weak infrastructure, shortcomings in the 
legal, financial and accounting systems, and poor local working 
conditions.

  [Text] Accompanied by His Excellency [H.E.] Sok An, H.E. 
Khieu Kanharit, and other aides, Samdech Hun Sen, vice chairman 
of the Cambodian People's Party and second prime minister of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia, arrived in Tokyo on 9 May. 
  That morning at the New Otani Hotel, Samdech Hun Sen granted 
an audience to H.E. (Nishio) Watanabe, former chairman of the 
Liberal Democratic Party, who expressed his joy concerning the 
positive developments in the Cambodian peace process. H.E. 
Watanabe also expressed the firm hope that the current meeting 
of the Socialist International Council would certainly welcome 
the good experiences of national reconciliation and development 
from the Cambodian delegation. 
  In his reply, Samdech Hun Sen conveyed the Cambodian 
people's 
gratitute to the Japanese people, who had helped the Cambodian 
people sail across a difficult stage in their history. He 
pointed out that although the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] 
faces a great many problems that have piled up for more than 20 
years -- especially the social, economic, and Khmer Rouge 
problems -- the RGC is still optimistic about Cambodia's future. 
This is because what is important now is that Cambodia's 
problem is no longer a foreign conflict or intervention, but it 
is only the concern of Cambodia. 
  Samdech Hun Sen also invited H.E. Watanabe, an activist and 
a 
pioneer in the construction of the Chroy Changva bridge [in 
Phnom Penh], to visit Cambodia. The latter accepted the 
invitation with pleasure. 
  That afternoon, Samdech Hun Sen and his delegation visited 
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where he conducted research and study 
on key mechanisms of a free-market economy. 
  In the evening, Samdech Hun Sen and his delegation attended 
a 
reception in their honor by Japanese deputy foreign minister 
(Azuma). H.E. (Azuma) expressed his concern about the 
development of less than good relations between the Kingdom of 
Cambodia and the Kingdom of Thailand, both good friends of 
Japan. He voiced hope that the two countries would be able to 
reach a wise and peaceful settlement. 
  For his part, Samdech Hun Sen informed H.E. (Azuma) about 
the 
view of the RGC, which believes that it cannot rebuild the 
country by taking its neighbors as enemies. Therefore, it is 
not the time for Cambodian-Thai relations, although tense in the 
recent past, to be considered ruptured. The RGC will strive to 
maintain its patience and preserve good relations with its 
neighbors, thereby insuring regional stability 
  The reception was held in an atmosphere of joy and 
cordiality.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Three Chinese suspected of 
helping immigrants enter Japan illegally have been put on the 
wanted list, the metropolitan police department said Tuesday [10 
May]. The three are believed to be members of a detained 
Chinese group that allegedly brokered the illegal immigration of 
71 Chinese in Wakayama Prefecture in February. 
  The two men and one woman, whose whereabouts are unknown, 
are 
suspected of helping to hide and guard the immigrants after 
their arrival. 
  New evidence indicates the group was also behind the illegal 
immigration of another 28 Chinese last November, investigators 
at the department's public security division said. At an 
apartment in Tokyo's Toshima Ward, which presumably served as 
the group's hideout, investigators found notes mentioning 
"travel expenses for 28" or "prepare bread for 28 guests." 
  The findings indicate the group provided the immigrants with 
train tickets and provisions, investigators said. 
  Preliminary investigations found the leader of a Hong Kong 
smuggling ring paid 1.5 million yen to the group to bring the 
immigrants to Japan. The ring had developed a sophisticated 
network with separate groups supervising different legs of the 
journey. 
  One group organized the trip from local areas in China to 
the 
port of embarkation and another was responsible for the crossing 
to Japan. A third batch accompanied the newly arrived to Nagoya 
Station, where they were taken over [by] a fourth group that 
guided them to Tokyo Station, the final destination. 
  The arrested group dealt with the Nagoya-Tokyo transaction, 
according to police.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10, IRNA -- Oil Minister Gholam Reza 
Aqazadeh said here Monday that Iran is working towards creating 
an international consensus on energy based on economic growth, 
preservation of the environment, stabilization of international 
supply and demand, and a fair and reasonable crude oil price. 
Aqazadeh who arrived here Monday made the remark in a meeting 
with the Japanese corporate leaders. 
  Mentioning that Iran was the third crude oil supplier to 
Japan, he called for a greater market share in that country. 
  Iran is the second highest crude oil producer among the 13 
states who form the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries (OPEC) and the second crude oil exporter in the world. 
  Iran is second in the world in terms of gas reserves, said 
the Iranian minister, adding that in the coming decade the 
country will become one of the major suppliers of gas and oil. 
  Aqazadeh said Iran attaches special priority to meet Japan's 
needs in the oil and gas sector. 
  He welcomed investments from foreign companies including 
Japanese for development of Iran's oil and gas fields in the 
second 5-year development plan (1994-98). 
  Referring to Iran as an "important gateway" to the Central 
Asian republics, he suggested that the Japanese corporate 
manufacture their goods in Iran with the aim of exporting them 
to the Central Asian and Persian Gulf states. 
  Aqazadeh voiced concern over the current situation of the 
oil 
market and said the price slump means a decline in the oil 
producers' income, slow down in their development coupled with 
more output to meet the world's growing energy demand, and 
finally lesser trade with industrialized states. 
  The oil minister reminded that this would trigger an energy 
crisis in the future. 
  The world today has no other way to put an end to its 
current 
economic malaise, except developing the economic interdependence 
among various regions, producers and consumers of energy, he 
stressed. 
  Aqazadeh is to leave Japan for Seoul, South Korea, Tuesday 
on 
a 4-day visit.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Albanian Foreign Minister 
Alfred Serreqi expressed hope Tuesday [10 May] that Japan will 
become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council [SC], 
Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Serreqi told Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa that it 
is "natural" for Japan to become a permanent member considering 
its importance in the international community, the officials 
said. 
  In a 40-minute meeting followed by dinner, Kakizawa urged 
Albania not to deal "emotionally" on problems involving 
Albanians living in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia] and Kosovo in neighboring Serbia, the officials said. 
  Serreqi replied that Albania seeks to solve the problems 
through talks and does not approve of changing borders by force. 
  Kakizawa pledged to extend a loan of up to 2.16 billion yen 
for a project aimed at increasing agricultural production and 
processed products and to realize macroeconomic stabilization, 
officials said. 
  The 30-year-loan, with a 10-year grace period, has an annual 
interest rate of 1 percent, they said. 
  Kakizawa also told Serreqi that Japan plans to dispatch 
macroeconomic experts in June or July to advise on policies and 
to send a mission to Albania this summer to study economic 
cooperation. 
  Kakizawa told Serreqi that Japan will offer economic 
assistance on condition that Albania maintain friendly relations 
with its neighboring nations such as Macedonia, Serbia and 
Greece they said. 
  Serreqi, 55, will conclude his five-day visit in Japan on 
Saturday.

  [Text] Sydney, May 11 KYODO -- Australia plans to increase 
its staff in the consulate general in Japan's No. 2 business 
center at Osaka, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said Wednesday 
[11 May]. Three new staff, one officer from the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade, and two local employees, will be 
added to the 31-strong staff at the consulate, Evans said. 
  Evans said trade and tourism between Osaka and the vicinity, 
and Australia will expand following the opening of New Kansai 
International Airport later this year. 
  "Freeing up those officers who are currently dealing in 
consular and administrative work will enable them to do more 
analysis and commerce related work, and liaise more with 
authorities in Osaka," a department spokesman said. 
  "While Australia's emphasis is on boosting links with all of 
Asia, we are not forgetting our traditional friends and 
marketplace in Japan," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- A leader of Myanmar's 
[Burma] suppressed National League for Democracy (NLD) has urged 
Japan not to renew Official Development Assistance (ODA) to his 
country until democracy has been fully restored. 
  "We call on our friends to help us bring real change to 
Burma 
by sustaining the pressure. We especially call on our host 
country, Japan, not to renew ODA assistance at this time," said 
Win Khet, chairman of the NLD in the "liberated area" along the 
Thai-Myanmar border which is held by anti-government forces. 
  Win Khet made the remarks Tuesday [10 May] in a speech at 
the 
congress of the Socialist International in Tokyo, of which KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE obtained a copy Wednesday. 
  The manuscript quoted Win Khet as saying, "1994 is a very 
critical year for Burma. We may be on the verge of bringing 
about real political change in Burma or we may see the 
dictatorship succeed in legitimizing and consolidating its 
power." 
  Following almost three decades of military rule, the NLD, 
led 
by prominent dissident and Nobel Peace Price winner Aung San Suu 
Kyi, won a landslide victory in the 1990 general elections. 
  But Myanmar's junta, the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (SLORC), defied the public vote, put Aung San Suu Kyi 
under house arrest in Yangon [Rangoon] and announced that it 
would remain in power for a further five to 10 years. 
  Japan, Myanmar's long, largest benefactor, joined other 
major 
donor nations in suspending economic assistance in 1988 after 
the Army killed hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators. But 
early the following year it broke ranks and decided to continue 
with economic assistance already pledged. 
  Win Khet, though, dismissed recent concessions by the 
military government such as cease-fire talks with ethnic rebel 
groups or allowing a U.S. congressman to meet with Aung San Suu 
Kyi as merely "cosmetic" and aiming at legitimizing the junta's 
regime. 
  At the same time Myanmar's military is building up its 
strength by purchasing arms from China worth 1 billion U.S. 
dollars, he said. 
  He warned against taking "token democratic reforms" as 
justification for cooperation with Myanmar's military 
government, and said that while SLORC maintains to have sought 
dialogue with "a negative and counterproductive" Aung San Suu 
Kyi, nobody actually went to see her. "If SLORC does not 
recognize Aung San Suu Kyi's leadership, if it will not talk to 
her or allow her to participate in Burma's future, there can be 
no real change -- economic or political -- in Burma," he said. 
  "Those who advocate `constructive engagement' should be 
really constructive to the Burmese people and not to the 
military, by acknowledging the right of the Burmese people to 
choose their own government," Win Khet said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The Acer Group, a leading 
Taiwanese personal computer maker, will boost its investments in 
Japan, including tie-ups with Japanese firms, the group's head 
said Monday [9 May]. 
  Stan Shih, chairman of the Taipei-based group, told a press 
conference that the increased interest in the Japanese market 
reflects growing sales of its PCs here. He said possible 
Japanese partners in the planned alliance will be trading houses. 
  The group posted 400 million yen in sales in the 
January-March quarter this year in Japan, almost equivalent to 
that for the whole year of 1993. For the current business year 
ending in March 1995, the group expects 10,000 units of sales 
worth 2 billion yen. 
  Established in 1991, the far-flung group has bases in Asia, 
Europe and the United States. The Japanese unit was formed in 
1988 to handle marketing.

  [Text] TOKYO, May 11 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
told a visitor from China on Wednesday [11 May] that Japan will 
broaden the teaching of history in schools to inform the younger 
generations about Japan's acts of aggression before and during 
World War II, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  In a meeting with Liu Peng, the visiting president of the 
All-China Youth Federation, Hata was quoted as saying, "Japan 
must tell the generations of its offspring that such incidents 
(acts of aggression) occurred." The two met at his official 
residence. 
  Liu told Hata he was "surprised" at the remark by former 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, who caused widespread anger by 
calling the 1937 Nanjing massacre a "fabrication." Nagano 
resigned Saturday and was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai. 
  "The remark was made by an elderly man and I know that 
Japanese youth does not have such a perception," Liu was quoted 
as saying. 
  In an interview with the mass-circulation daily MAINICHI 
SHIMBUN published May 4, Nagano said the actions of the Imperial 
Japanese Army was aimed at liberating Asian countries from 
Western colonialism. 
  Hata told Liu Japan "feels deep repentance" over the Nagano 
remarks and is determined not to repeat a war of aggression.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii denied Wednesday [11 May] that Group of Seven (G-7) major 
nations have agreed to take joint action in their credit 
policies. "There were no such talks at a G-7 meeting of finance 
ministers and central bankers in late April... [ellipses as 
received] or after that," Fujii told a regular press meeting. 
  He was referring to a report by a major Japanese daily 
quoting U.S. monetary officials as saying Japan, Germany and the 
United States agreed on concerted moves on interest rates in 
line with the recent joint G-7 intervention to stem volatility 
in currency rates. But, Fujii reiterated that G-7 nations will 
continue taking "appropriate, timely" action in the currency 
markets. 
  The Bank of Japan continued to take a loose stance in the 
money market to send the key overnight unsecured call rate down 
to record low levels Wednesday. 
  Meanwhile, the German Bundesbank is expected to cut its 
discount rate overnight and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board is 
widely speculated to raise the discount rate next week. 
  The Japanese and German credit easing helps the U.S. dollar 
rise, while the U.S. is tightening its credit to prevent 
inflation. 
  Pressed by reporters on whether his concern over the yen's 
rise has eased somewhat, Fujii acknowledged that the yen's rise 
in fact has a "deflationary impact on exporters." But he 
omitted using the word "concern" as he has in the past. 
  Fujii said he is "not pessimistic" about the economy as a 
whole and noted that currency rates are one of the factors.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Norwegian Prime Minister Gro 
Harlem Brundtland said Monday [9 May] that Japan should play a 
greater role in the U.N. Security Council, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. Brundtland made the remarks in a meeting with 
Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, the officials said. 
  Kakizawa told Brundtland that Japan is ready to become a 
permanent member of the council if recommended and that it 
intends to contribute as much as possible to U.N. activities, 
they said. 
  Brundtland and Kakizawa agreed that reform of the council 
will not be completed just by giving Japan and Germany permanent 
seats. They also agreed on the need to take into account the 
balance between regional and developing nations. 
  The Norwegian prime minister called on Japanese cabinet 
ministers to visit Norway, they said. 
  The 30-minute meeting was conducted in English, without 
interpreters, the officials said. 
  Brundtland is in Japan for a three-day stay until Wednesday 
to attend a council meeting of the Socialist International. She 
will meet Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday evening.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- The government decided 
Wednesday to dismantle a decades-old law requiring exports to be 
inspected for quality control as part of the government's 
deregulation policy, officials said. 
  The decision by the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry to abolish the export inspection law follows approval 
earlier in the day by the Export Inspection and Design Promotion 
Council, an advisory panel to the minister, ministry officials 
said. 
  They said the abolishment of the law will be incorporated in 
a package of deregulation measures to be announced by the 
government by the end of next month. 
  The law was enacted in 1957 with the aim of improving the 
quality of exports and thereby promoting exports. Under the 
legislation, designated goods are required to pass export 
inspections before being shipped abroad.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Opposition party leaders on 
Tuesday chided Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata for failing to 
provide policy specifics in his first speech to the Diet. 
  Yohei Kono, president of the No. 1 opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party, accused Hata of trying to please everybody by 
avoiding specific statements on "urgent" controversial issues. 
Kono told reporters Hata "stopped short of commenting on how to 
grapple with problems that require urgent responses under the 
current extraordinary situation." 
  Tomiichi Murayama, head of the second largest opposition 
Social Democratic Party, told reporters Hata should have offered 
a more explicit explanation on "a statement by his cabinet 
minister on collective security arrangements." 
  "The public has come to question the stand of this 
administration in the wake of a statement by a cabinet minister 
on collective security rights," Murayama said. 
  He was apparently referring to a recent statement by Foreign 
Minister Koji Kakizawa that Japan should rethink its current 
constitutional interpretation, taken as banning collective 
security arrangements, to allow Japan the right to join an 
offensive if an ally were attacked. 
  Japanese Communist Party Presidium Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa 
told 
reporters that Hata's expression of the government's readiness 
to respond to a contingency on the Korean peninsula in concert 
with the United States and South Korea was "a dangerous 
declaration." 
  New party Sakigake [Harbinger] leader Masayoshi Takemura 
said, "Although he emphasized the pacifist nature of the 
Constitution, it does not correspond with arguments by his 
cabinet ministers about the need to enact laws to deal with 
military contingencies or collective security rights."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- The head of the second 
largest opposition party Wednesday [11 May] called for a snap 
general election for the House of Representatives under the old 
system of multiseat constituencies. 
  Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
said 
in a speech that the government and the opposition should agree 
on an election for the key lower house of parliament under the 
old system, which is soon to be replaced with a mixture of 
single-seat constituencies and a proportional representation 
system. 
  Murayama said the snap election should be called on 
condition 
that ruling and opposition camps agree that its next election 
for the lower house will be conducted under the new system. 
  A government advisory body is now working on delimiting 
single-seat constituencies in line with a political reform 
package that the cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa pushed through the Diet in January. 
  The seven-member commission is expected to finish the task 
in 
June. But more time is necessary to enact a delimitation bill 
in the Diet, officials said. 
  The four-year term of office for members of the current 
511-seat lower chamber will last through July 1997, but the 
prime minister can call a snap election at any time. 
  Murayama's call for an early election came as the latest 
round in the SDP's recent salvo on its former coalition 
partners, which are running a minority government. 
  Murayama, arguing the current minority-backed cabinet of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is on a precarious footing, said, 
"The only way (to secure a stable government) is to build up a 
solid foundation through an election." A cabinet that cannot 
carry out its tasks should either resign or the lower house 
should be dissolved to pave the way for balloting, he said. 
  The SDP chief also swiped at a recent series of remarks by 
key cabinet members that call for steps to ensure Japan's 
collective security or legislation to handle emergencies, such 
as an international crisis over North Korea's suspected nuclear 
arms program. He said these remarks run counter to the policy 
agreement among the coalition partners before they jointly 
formed a cabinet under Hosokawa, who resigned in April over 
financial improprieties. 
  If the Hata cabinet takes a different stance over the 
security and constitutional issues from the Hosokawa government, 
Murayama hinted the SDP may submit a no-confidence motion to the 
Diet. 
  The SDP broke ranks with the ruling coalition immediately 
after it helped elect Hata to succeed Hosokawa due to a row over 
the move among the coalition's majority components to form a new 
Diet bloc. 
  Hata lashed out at Murayama's call for an early general 
election, making clear he has no plan to dissolve the lower 
house any time soon. "Let me ask why, then, in the first place 
the coalition including the SDP passed the political reform 
bills," he told reporters. "There are undoubtedly people who 
don't really want to see political reform," he said. 
  "The coalition government is still in place, and it's not 
the time to dissolve the House," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Key coalition strategist 
Ichiro Ozawa on Tuesday [10 May] criticized a move among 
opposition parties to seek an early dissolution of the House of 
Representatives, saying the next general election should be held 
under a new electoral system combining single-seat 
constituencies and proportional representation seats. 
  Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party 
Shinseito, told a news conference it would be ridiculous to hold 
an election under the current multiseat constituency system, 
noting that a government advisory body has been set up to 
delimit single-seat constituencies. 
  Leaders of the country's two largest political parties, the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), both of which are in the opposition, have argued for the 
dissolution of the lower house for a general election to be 
contested under the existing multiseat system. 
  The LDP, which has been urging the minority government of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to hand over power, is poised to 
table a no-confidence motion after the enactment of the already 
overdue fiscal 1994 budget, expected in a month or two. 
  The SDP, which quit the coalition immediately after its 
members voted for Hata in the Diet's prime ministerial election 
on April 25, has stepped up criticism against what it calls the 
coalition's high-handed management. SDP Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama on Monday vowed to put the party on alert for a 
"battle" that could come at any time, hinting he is looking for 
an early general election. 
  Asked how Hata's minority government will try to survive, 
Ozawa said the coalition will continue efforts to acquire a 
majority by coming out with its policies in the Diet. 
  He also said that disagreement over policies caused the 
SDP's 
withdrawal from the coalition, and that the formation of a 
130-member parliamentary group "kaishin" (innovation) excluding 
the SDP had merely provided the party with the excuse to leave 
the alliance.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Three senior Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) legislators, widely dubbed the "YKK trio" 
by the media, decided to create a new policy study group free 
from faction ties, LDP sources said Tuesday [10 May]. 
  The three vocal legislators are former Construction Minister 
Taku Yamazaki, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato and 
former Posts and Telecommunications Minister Junichiro Koizumi. 
The name, "YKK trio," is based on the initials of their family 
names. 
  The trio plans to bring together liberal legislators from 
both the main opposition LDP and non-LDP political parties, 
with an eye to the possibility of a major reconfiguration of 
alliances within the political community in the near future, 
they said. 
  The political community is rife with speculation over the 
imminence of such restructuring if the LDP succeeds in mustering 
the support of the second largest opposition Social Democratic 
Party in passing a no-confidence motion against the minority 
government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata through the Diet. 
  Yamazaki, a longtime backer of former Foreign Minister 
Michio 
Watanabe, said the new group will seek to "reform the LDP even 
at the risk of disbanding the party." Yamazaki also said the 
new group will seek to release legislators from the customary 
obligations and bonds of LDP factions to which they belong. 
  Kato said the new group will try to be the driving spirit 
behind deregulation and other policies. 
  The trio is lobbying other legislators from various factions 
to bolster the size of the new group to the order of 50, they 
said. The group will convene its first meeting early next week 
to decide on its formal name. 
  The trio has been deemed as the critics of the current LDP 
leadership led by LDP president Yohei Kono. Kato dismissed 
speculation that the new group is seeking to form an alliance 
with Watanabe, whose threat to splinter from the LDP plunged the 
party into a serious quandary last month.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- The newly-launched cabinet 
of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has a 47 percent public approval 
rating, a sharp decrease of 24 percentage points from a poll 
taken just after last August's inauguration of the cabinet of 
his predecessor, Morihiro Hosokawa, an ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper 
poll showed Wednesday [11 May]. The ASAHI said the public 
disapproval rate for the Hata cabinet was 32 percent. 
  The national daily added that the initial support rate for 
the Hata cabinet is 10 percentage points lower than the approval 
rate for the Hosokawa cabinet's last stage as scored by the 
ASAHI survey in February. The ASAHI said a new cabinet usually 
holds a higher approval rating than that for the last stage of 
the previous cabinet. 
  The newspaper conducted its nationwide survey of 3,000 
eligible voters on Sunday and Monday. The response rate was 80 
percent. 
  Only 19 percent of the respondents expected brighter 
political prospects with the establishment of a minority 
government, down 24 percentage points from the September survey 
last year, it said. 
  Regarding the next general election, 11 percent of those 
polled supported an immediate general election even before the 
Diet's passage of the government-proposed fiscal 1994 draft 
budget. 
  Twenty-three percent called for a general election under the 
current electoral system as soon as the Diet approves the draft 
budget, the ASAHI reported, while 26 percent said the general 
election should be conducted after the new electoral system 
takes effect. Some 31 percent said an early general election is 
not necessary, according to the survey. 
  The public support rate for the Japan New Party led by 
former 
Prime Minister Hosokawa plummeted to 5 percent, a decrease of 7 
percentage points from February. 
  The Shinseito of Prime Minister Hata gained a 14 percent of 
approval rating, an increase of 3 percentage points from 
February. [sentence as received] 
  The Social Democratic Party, which pulled out of the 
coalition, scored a 15 percent support rate, an increase of 2 
percentage points from February. 
  The main opposition Liberal Democratic Party got a 34 
percent 
approval rating, a slight increase of 1 percentage point from 
February, the ASAHI added.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- The Japan New Party (JNP), a 
member of the ruling coalition, decided Wednesday [11 May] to 
call for the disbanding of a joint parliamentary group in the 
House of Representatives whose formation triggered the 
withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) from the 
coalition, party officials said. The party led by former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa reached the agreement in a meeting of 
executives, the officials said. 
  The SDP decided to walk out of the coalition on April 26 
after Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Democratic Socialist 
Party [of Japan, SDPJ] and the Liberal Party, as well as the 
JNP, abruptly formed the 130-legislator parliamentary group, 
called Kaishin (Innovation), excluding the SDP, saying the move 
was a breach of trust. The SDP's withdrawal forced new Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata to launch a minority government. 
  As to whether Hosokawa should remain the party head, the 
party was divided on the issue and postponed a decision, the 
officials said. Hosokawa announced his resignation suddenly on 
April 8 over financial improprieties.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Cabinet ministers on Tuesday 
[10 May] criticized Shigeto Nagano, who was forced to resign 
Saturday as justice minister over his remarks that the 1937 
Nanjing massacre committed by the Japanese Imperial Army was a 
fabrication. 
  Moriyoshi Sato, chief of the Hokkaido and Okinawa 
Development 
Agencies, said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting 
that the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata "made the 
worst start. I'm ashamed of (such remarks) by our comrade. He 
resigned too late." Sato, like Nagano, belongs to Hata's 
Shinseito. 
  Referring to the responsibility of Hata, who appointed 
Nagano 
as justice minister, Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi 
defined Nagano's resignation as a dismissal, saying that 
discharging the justice minister settled the matter. 
  Transport Minister Nobuaki Futami expressed regret over the 
remarks by Nagano, saying he and Nagano had different 
perceptions of history and it was "natural" for Nagano to resign. 
  Nagano, 71, who assumed the post of justice minister on 
April 
28 in the new Hata administration, in an interview May 3 with 
the MAINICHI SHIMBUN, one of the country's major dailies, said, 
"I think that the Nanjing incident was a fabrication." 
  Imperial Japanese Army troops slaughtered more than 300,000 
Chinese civilians following the invasion of Nanjing in December 
1937, according to Chinese estimates. 
  Japanese historians tend to cite lower estimates and some 
argue the mass killings were caused by troops who got out of 
control. 
  Nagano also told the MAINICHI that it was wrong to call 
Japan 
an aggressor in World War II. 
  His remarks brought sharp criticism from neighboring 
countries, especially China and South and North Korea, which 
were invaded by Japan before the war. Nagano was replaced on 
Sunday by Hiroshi Nakai, a House of Representatives lawmaker of 
the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP).

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- New Justice Minister Hiroshi 
Nakai pledged Monday [9 May] to protect the Constitution and 
remain uninvolved in debates over the enactment of legislation 
covering emergencies and whether Japan should claim the right to 
collective defense. Nakai told his first press conference after 
assuming the ministerial post that he will not be drawn on 
debate over collective defense "because it is my duty to protect 
the Constitution and uphold law and order." 
  Nakai replaced Shigeto Nagano who resigned as justice 
minister Saturday to take responsibility for his remarks printed 
Wednesday in a newspaper in which he said the 1937 Nanjing 
massacre was a fabrication and that Japan's war with China and 
other countries was not an act of aggression. 
  Nagano is a former officer in the wartime Imperial Japanese 
Army and a former chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense 
Force. 
  Asked if he thought Nagano's former military career 
conflicted with the constitutional principle of civilian control 
and the stipulation that ministers of state should be drawn from 
civilian ranks, Nakai said he does not think this applies to a 
former military officer. 
  "That debate existed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but 
I 
have never heard mention of it in the Diet or anywhere else," 
Nakai said. "Mr. Nagano was made to take responsibility for 
causing trouble for the nation and the cabinet and I think he 
understands that."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- An investment consultant 
testified before a Diet budget committee Wednesday [11 May] that 
a dubious stock transaction was carried out by former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, not his late father-in-law as 
claimed by Hosokawa. 
  At a session of the House of Councillors Budget Committee, 
securities consultant Shuzo Fujiki, 60, said he served as an 
intermediary in a transaction to purchase 300 shares of Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986 for Hosokawa through 
his former secretary Masatoshi Miyama and company president 
Yusei Kuwahata, acquaintance of both Fujiki and Hosokawa. 
  Fujiki, as witness, said the Hosokawa side conveyed hopes to 
participate in tenders on NTT shares because (Hosokawa) could 
provide collateral for funds to purchase the shares. Fujiki 
also said Hosokawa used the name of his father-in-law in the 
transaction. 
  On March 30, Fujiki told reporters that Hosokawa himself 
carried out the questionable stock deal involving hundreds of 
millions of yen, contrary to Hosokawa's insistence that the 
stock transaction was solely conducted by his father-in-law. 
  The 418 million yen loan he arranged was extended with 
Hosokawa's condominium in central Tokyo as collateral, Fujiki 
said. Hosokawa said he purchased the condominium with 100 
million yen he borrowed form Sagawa Kyubin Co., a major 
scandal-tainted trucking firm in 1982. 
  Disputes over the stock deal and the 100 million yen loan 
caused a long delay of Diet deliberations on the state budget 
for fiscal 1994, which started April 1, and was partly 
responsible for Hosokawa's decision to resign as premier on 
April 25.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- An investment consultant, 
testifying before the Diet on Wednesday [11 May], described as a 
"lie" former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remark that his 
father-in-law asked the consultant to help him buy shares in the 
world's largest telephone company, Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT). 
  Shuzo Fujiki, the 60-year-old president of the Tokyo-based 
stock consulting firm, Random Walk, told the House of 
Councillors Budget Committee that the Hosokawa side asked him in 
1986 to act as an intermediary in securing a huge loan to buy 
NTT shares. "Telling a lie is outrageous as the truth is the 
truth. We must not allow lies to go unchallenged,'' Fujiki told 
the session. 
  Fujiki said Hosokawa asked him through Yusei Kuwahata, 
their common acquaintance, to help secure the loan to buy the 
300 NTT shares. 
  Kuwahata, former president of a computer information 
magazine, earlier told a news conference that he went to the 
southern Japan city of Kumamoto around August 1986 to invite 
Hosokawa to buy the shares during a meeting at a golf course 
clubhouse restaurant. "Mr. Kuwahata told me that then Kumamoto 
Gov. Hosokawa expressed his desire to tender his bids at a NTT 
share bidding, if only he can raise the (necessary) funds, as he 
has the collateral to put up, although he does not have the 
money," Fujiki said. 
  "Following that conversation from Mr. Kuwahata, Mr. 
(Masatoshi) Miyama (Hosokawa's chief financial secretary) 
contacted me, asking me to introduce a financial institution to 
lend money, as Hosokawa has collateral, but not money," he said. 
  Fujiki said he complied with the request by introducing the 
Tokyo Shoken Kinyu financing company to Hosokawa and then 
arranging for Miyama to meet the "responsible person" of the 
financing company in Fujiki's presence. 
  After the financing deal was struck, Fujiki said, "Mr. 
Miyama asked the Tokyo Shoken Kinyu executive if it would allow 
Hosokawa to use the name of a person other than himself in 
borrowing the money, as Hosokawa is renowned as the Kumamoto 
governor." 
  "The senior executive replied the firm will accept it (the 
other person's name)," he said. 
  The executive made a "bold decision" to lend as much as 418 
million yen to Hosokawa in view of his prestigious social 
standing as the Kumamoto governor despite the fact that the 
collateral was worth only 180 million yen, he said. 
  "Tokyo Shoken Kinyu would never have extended the loan if 
Mr. Hosokawa had been a person without any credit worthiness," 
he said. He said he did not know the name of Hosokawa's 
father-in-law until his name was reported by the media, as the 
Hosokawa side proceeded with the loan deal without informing 
him, once the loan arrangement was made. 
  Fujiki's testimony contradicts Hosokawa's own earlier 
statement to the Diet that his late father-in-law, Shohei Ueda, 
and not Hosokawa himself, initiated the investment deal, asking 
Hosokawa for help in securing the necessary loan. Hosokawa's 
father-in-law died last May. 
  Hosokawa repeatedly told the Diet he pledged his 
condominium in Tokyo as collateral to take out the 418 million 
yen loan from a stock investment financing firm and offered the 
money to his father-in-law. 
  Hosokawa dropped his bombshell resignation announcement on 
April 8 to take the blame for a "fresh suspicion" on his 
personal finances, which he said is different from the NTT deal. 
  NTT listed tenders for its shares from corporate and 
large-lot individual investors willing to purchase more than 100 
shares Oct. 4, 1986, before offering the shares for smaller-lot 
public subscription. 
  The Hosokawa side succeeded in acquiring all 300 NTT shares 
for which he had submitted bids on professional advice from 
Fujiki, the investment consultant said. 
  Hosokawa reportedly made a capital gain of 200 million yen 
by selling off 199 out of the 300 NTT shares in two 
installations in February and March 1987 at an average price of 
1.38 million yen. The remaining 101 shares are still in 
possession of his wife, Kayoko Hosokawa. 
  According to Fujiki, Hosokawa reneged upon his promise to 
pay 10% of the net proceeds from any sell-offs of the NTT 
shares as a "consulting fee." Hosokawa also broke the promise 
to allow the consultant to dictate the timing of the sell-offs, 
he said. 
  Later, Miyama visited Fujiki's Tokyo office and asked for 
Fujiki's consent to lower the sum of the consulting fee to 10 
million yen, he said, adding he accepted the request. 
  In a related development, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
joined the Liberal Democratic Party and the Japanese Communist 
Party in demanding the Diet summon Miyama as a witness to clear 
up the suspicions. 
  SDP Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Koken Nosaka told a 
news conference, "We cannot help demanding the summons of former 
Secretary Masatoshi Miyama as a witness. If necessary, we 
should also demand the summons of Mr. Hosokawa."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The strong yen has widened 
the price gap between domestic and imported rice in 1993, the 
Agriculture Ministry reported Tuesday [10 May]. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said its 
estimate showed that the price of rice purchased by the 
government from growers was 15 times higher than that of rice 
imported from Thailand, compared with 11 times in the preceding 
year. The calculation was made at the yen's average exchange 
rate against the dollar for the first nine months of 1993 of 
112.22 yen per dollar, up 14.43 yen over the year before, the 
ministry said. 
  The ministry said the government's purchase price of 
domestic 
rice in 1993 was unchanged from the year before at about 210,000 
yen per ton, compared with about 14,000 yen for Thai rice, down 
5,000 yen from the preceding year, and about 26,000 yen for U.S. 
rice, down 4,000 yen. 
  At the retail level, the average price of domestic rice for 
the January-October period of 1993 stood at 384 yen per 
kilogram, up 10 yen over the year before due to a poor harvest. 
  In the same period, the ministry said, the retail price of 
Thai rice dropped 9 yen from the year before to 48 yen per 
kilogram while that of U.S. rice was down 19 yen at 128 yen.

  [Text] Kobe, May 10 KYODO -- A government panel studying 
agricultural policies on Tuesday [10 May] received calls for a 
review of the controversial Food Control Law which regulates 
rice production and distribution, Farm Ministry officials said. 
  The Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory panel 
to 
the prime minister, held a closed-door session here Tuesday to 
hear views from 11 representatives of agricultural, distribution 
and consumer groups in western Japan, the officials said. Most 
attendants called for the government to make efforts toward 
self-sufficiency in rice production and stable supplies, while 
seeking a review of the Food Control Law, taking a flexible 
approach to rice production and sales, the officials said. 
  They said the representatives of agricultural cooperatives 
and consumer organizations urged the government to ease 
regulations on rice production and distribution. 
  The council plans to hold similar sessions in six other 
cities, including Sapporo and Miyazaki, before working out an 
interim report for the government in July.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- The head of an employers' 
association said Wednesday [11 May] the ongoing restructuring of 
business operations at Japanese firms would inevitably result in 
a temporary increase in unemployment. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), told a news conference it is 
not easy to carry out corporate reorganization without reducing 
jobs in view of the serious business environment caused by the 
strong yen. He said employers have so far done their best to 
prevent an increase of unemployment. 
  The strong yen has caused a serious impact on corporate 
performance, particularly in the raw materials industry, he 
said. Nagano expressed hope that the dollar will rise to around 
105 yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Japan's steel exports rose in 
fiscal 1993 for the third straight year, but the average export 
price fell below 70,000 yen per ton for the first time in 20 
years amid increased competition, the Japan Iron and Steel 
Federation said Monday [9 May]. 
  In the fiscal year ended March 31, the volume of steel 
exports grew 26.2 percent to 24.51 million metric tons, 
exceeding 20 million tons for the first time in five years, the 
federation said. 
  In yen terms, the average export price fell by 22,800 yen to 
69,700 yen per ton as increased competition combined with the 
yen's appreciation put downward pressure on export prices. 
  Exports to China posted a 2.36-fold jump to 6.86 million 
tons, while those to Taiwan and South Korea climbed by 19.5 
percent and 39.5 percent, respectively. 
  In contrast to the brisk exports to Asia, exports to the 
United States fell for the sixth straight year, sliding by 7.6 
percent to 2.22 million tons. In dollar terms, exports 
increased by 10.2 percent to 15.80 billion dollars, but fell by 
4.9 percent in yen terms to 1.70 trillion yen. 
  The federation also reported that the nation's steel imports 
fell by 2.2 percent in fiscal 1993 to 8.82 million tons, 
slipping below 10 million tons for the second consecutive year.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- The Japan Securities Dealers 
Association has named Sadakane Doi, chairman of Daiwa Securities 
Co., as its next chairman, current association head Masaru 
Aratani said Tuesday [10 May]. Doi is to assume the two 
year-term chairmanship on July 1, Aratani told reporters. 
  It will be the first time since a series of stock scandals 
in 
1991 for an official from one of the "big four" brokerage houses 
to head the securities industry organization. Before the 
scandals, involving payments of loss compensation by brokerages 
to big customers after the collapse of the "bubble economy," the 
big four -- Nomura, Nikko, Yamaichi and Daiwa Securities 
Companies -- customarily took turns to supply the association's 
chief. 
  In line with the association's self-governing rule, Doi will 
give up the rights to represent Daiwa, though he will remain the 
brokerage's chairman when he becomes the association chief. 
  The Finance Ministry initially wanted a full-time chairman 
of 
the association, but the association argued that limits should 
not be put on the post. 
  Giving up of the company representative rights by Doi is 
viewed as a compromise between the ministry and the association. 
The association will hold a general meeting on May 25 to change 
its articles so Doi can assume the association's chairmanship 
while remaining in his post at Daiwa.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Tuesday [10 May] he will continue his predecessor Morihiro 
Hosokawa's agenda to hike the consumption tax and cut income 
taxes. 
  He asked the tax commission to draw up "appropriate 
guidelines" for tax reform "based on the pillar of lessening 
personal income taxes and fulfilling taxation on consumption." 
  Hata was speaking at the start of an afternoon meeting of 
the 
commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister that is to 
present tax options next month for politicians to choose from. 
He asked the panel members to "treat the earlier request of 
former Prime Minister Hosokawa as my request," saying he plans 
to push the same package that includes "permanent income tax 
cuts." 
  Hata pledged "utmost efforts" to keep Hosokawa's vow of 
submitting the government's tax legislation by the end of next 
month and getting it through parliament this year, with "the 
cooperation and understanding of the various parties." 
  Opposition to a consumption tax hike by the Social 
Democratic 
Party was a key problem for the Hosokawa government. The 
socialists quit the coalition, leaving Hata to form the first 
minority government in nearly four decades. 
  In addition to the shifting the tax burden away from direct 
levies such as income tax toward indirect levies like the 
consumption tax, Hosokawa also said as prime minister that 
Japan's net tax burden must grow to meet the coming needs of the 
nation's graying society.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Business leaders urged Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata to pass the overdue fiscal 1994 budget 
quickly in the Diet and take measures to help small and 
medium-size businesses suffering from the recession. 
  They also separately appealed to Hata to redistrict for a 
new 
single-seat electoral system under a Diet-approved overhaul of 
the current multiseat electoral system. 
  Hata replied the tasks must be done and will draw 
international criticism if they are not. 
  The business leaders were Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the 
Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), Masaru Hayami, 
president of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives 
(Keizai Doyukai) and Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry. 
  Hiraiwa also told Hata the government should try to keep the 
yen-dollar rate at an appropriate level and promote political, 
administrative and economic reforms. 
  Hayami asked Hata to follow the reform-oriented policies 
pursued by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and appealed 
for a national election under a new electoral system after 
summer.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- A business leader urged 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday [10 May] to 
achieve progress in economic reform to ensure domestic economic 
recovery and a better relationship with the United States. 
  "Steadfast progress in economic reform is vital to a sure 
turnaround in the economy and improvement in the Japan-U.S. 
relationship," said Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Association 
of Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai], visiting Hata at his 
headquarters. 
  He called on the premier to move forward with economic 
reforms, including deregulation, which former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa had implemented. 
  Hayami's comments met with approval from Hata, who said he 
agreed with the business leader's view completely. 
  Hayami also said he hoped the bill for dividing the nation 
into 300 single-seat electoral districts for House of 
Representatives elections would be enacted soon, and that 
efforts would be made for tax system reforms.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Members of the Group of 
Seven (G-7) industrial nations will continue intervening in 
foreign exchange markets to stem excessive fluctuations of 
currency rates, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [10 
May]. 
  Fujii, speaking at a regular press conference after a 
morning 
cabinet meeting, declined as usual to comment on exchange rate 
levels but said, "it has become a consensus among the (G-7) 
nations that recent movements were led by speculation not 
reflecting economic fundamentals." 
  G-7 financial authorities have intervened jointly in the 
currency markets since finance ministers and central bankers 
reaffirmed in late April in Washington that they would cooperate 
to keep exchange rates stable and reflecting fundamentals. 
Fujii said, "We are constantly keeping in close contact to take 
appropriate, timely measures to cope with unstable movements." 
  Concerning Japan's current account surplus, Fujii said 
steady 
implementation of the February 15.25 trillion yen stimulus 
package will boost domestic demand for a "meaningful" reduction. 
  The politically sensitive surplus topped 130 billion dollars 
to hit a second consecutive record in the fiscal 1993 figures 
released Monday. But Fujii stressed that exports declined and 
imports expanded in volume terms, and yen-based figures pointed 
to the first decline in three years. 
  While dismissing the need for any fresh fiscal actions, 
Fujii 
said he stressed at the cabinet meeting the importance of 
drawing up a bill in June and having it enacted by the end of 
the year for tax reform, including permanent tax cuts. 
  Japan promised in its March market-opening package to detail 
the tax reform, especially to extend the 6 trillion yen tax cuts 
implemented for the current fiscal year. 
  The minister rejected reports that the government's tax 
commission is considering multiple consumption tax rates as one 
of the options for its proposals to be issued in June. The 
November report issued by the commission, an advisory panel to 
the prime minister, indicated such multiple rates are 
inappropriate, Fujii said. 
  The Finance Ministry is insisting a single consumption tax 
rate, currently at 3 percent, and a uniform rate hike to offset 
income tax cuts. 
  Referring to a monthly economic report issued by the 
Economic 
Planning Agency (EPA), Fujii said, "I don't consider it as 
pessimistic." The report kept its assessment unchanged from the 
previous month, saying the economy remains generally sluggish 
although some bright signs are emerging. 
  Fujii said, "The economy is at a delicate stage...with even 
experts mixed in their assessment" over recent statistics 
showing both good and bad signs.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japan's economic planning 
chief Yoshio Terasawa indicated concern Tuesday [10 May] that 
recent surges of the yen against the dollar could again hurt the 
nation's economy. A morning meeting of economic-related 
ministers reflected "an atmosphere that the effect from the 
yen's rise is extremely severe," Terasawa, director general of 
the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told a regular news 
conference. 
  Terasawa declined to confirm that a monthly EPA report, 
delivered at the meeting, indicates an official view that the 
current economic slump is Japan's longest postwar downturn. The 
report repeated the previous month's "generally sluggish" 
assessment. 
  "It's in an extremely severe condition," with the economy 
very difficult to predict, he said. 
  The report, like others from the Finance Ministry and the 
Bank of Japan, reported some bright signs in such areas as 
personal consumption but noted continuing declines in capital 
spending. 
  The central bank, however, has recently indicated that 
Japan's economic decline seems to be halting. But Terasawa said 
the EPA has not changed its overall view or its judgment of 
major economic factors. 
  He repeatedly stressed concern over the effects of the 
higher 
yen, which pummels Japan's export-reliant economy. He said he 
told the morning economic ministers' meeting that rapid currency 
movements hurt corporate sentiment and "cannot help but have a 
minus effect on the economy." 
  Terasawa quoted Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno as 
telling the meeting that rapid exchange rate movements are 
"undesirable" and that rates should reflect economic 
fundamentals. 
  Mieno noted the concerted dollar-boosting foreign exchange 
market interventions by the U.S., Japanese, German and other 
leading central banks in the past two weeks, according to 
Terasawa. 
  Japan will continue to take "approriate steps at the 
appropriate time in close contact with" other major industrial 
nations, he quoted Mieno as saying. 
  Terasawa, who has experience on Wall Street with a major 
Japanese brokerage, expressed hope that concerted interventions 
would have "a large impact" on curbing the soaring yen. But he 
cited political uncertainty as a big factor in the "speculative" 
movements that he said have characterized recent jittery foreign 
exchange trading. 
  Until problems like Japan-U.S. trade friction are resolved, 
such uncertainty will continue to weigh on the market, Terasawa 
said. 
  The recent interventions, especially one led by the U.S. 
Federal Reserve last Wednesday, lifted the dollar from within a 
whisker of its postwar record low of 100.40 yen, marked in Tokyo 
last August. 
  But currency dealers wondered how effective the 
interventions 
will be and questioned Washington's commitment to supporting the 
dollar. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sharply reversed the 
U.S. tolerance for a high yen, saying the government does not 
want "an undervalued currency." Last year, U.S. officials 
repeatedly said the yen's rise would help curb Japan's trade 
surplus. 
  On the Japanese economy, Terasawa quoted Mieno as noting 
that 
money supply growth remains slow and that despite recent rises 
of longer-term market rates, overall interest rates remain 
"extremely low."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japan's economy has been in 
a slump for 37 straight months since May 1991, the longest in 
postwar history, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said in a 
monthly report Tuesday [10 May]. "The Japanese economy is going 
through an adjustment phase and showing an overall slump, 
although there are some bright signs," the EPA said. 
  The phrase is exactly the same as the one used the previous 
month when the agency noted "bright signs" of recovery for the 
first time in nine months. This month's report drew public 
attention as to whether or not the agency recognizes any major 
changes for the better. 
  Yoshio Terasawa, EPA director general, told reporters after 
a 
morning cabinet meeting, "The economy is now in a very severe 
state." 
  Meanwhile, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said, "I don't 
think the latest EPA report is pessimistic." 
  In its latest report, the agency cited as a positive sign 
the 
upturn in personal expenditures, particularly household spending 
on durable goods such as videocassette recorders, television 
sets and washing machines. Other bright spots included new 
housing starts, which continued above 1.5 million units per 
month over the past several months, and corporate confidence, 
which appeared to have stopped deteriorating. 
  However, the agency said corporate earnings continued to 
drop, resulting in weak private-sector investment in plant and 
equipment. 
  Although some progress is seen in inventory reductions, 
industrial output remained lackluster, dropping from 
previous-year levels by a range of 3.0 to 4.4 percent per month 
between January and March, it added. 
  An agency official said that it is premature at this point 
to 
assess the economy as clearly picking up. 
  Industrial production in April and May is likely to decline 
by more than 2 percent from year-earlier levels, according to a 
survey of manufacturers, the official pointed out. 
  Personal spending could deteriorate again because the 
general 
earnings environment remained weak with relatively small 
increases in monthly wages and bonuses and as the employment 
situation continued to be difficult, he added.

  [Text] France has reportedly summoned Prince Sirivut to go 
immediately to Paris to see the French foreign and defense 
ministers so that more military aid can be provided to the 
two-headed government to do away with the Cambodian nation and 
race. 
  The general public asks why France openly makes itself the 
frontline enemy of the Cambodian nation and people. Have the 
latter ever done anything affecting French interests that 
prompts it to implement a dark policy toward Cambodia? 
  To answer this question, it is worth recalling: 
  1. A long time ago in Indochina, France adopted a policy of 
constant support for the late Ho Chi Minh's Indochinese strategy 
of swallowing and incorporating Cambodia into Vietnam's 
Indochina. In 1949, the French Government of (Kuch Floret), the 
then master of Indochina, decided, without consulting the 
Cambodian side in the least, to give Cambodia's Kampuchea Kraom 
to the Vietnamese King Bao Dai with the aim of protecting French 
interests in Indochina. The action was an encroachment upon the 
rights of the Cambodian nation and people, who are the owners of 
Kampuchea Kraom, and the right to self-determination of millions 
of Cambodian people living there. Why did France sell out the 
Cambodian nation and people in Kampuchea Kraom? The reason was 
that it needed to include Vietnam's Indochinese federation in 
its arena for the purpose of serving its strategy in Southeast 
Asia and the Pacific. Although Cambodia lost its race, France 
did not care about the country's destiny and future. What was 
important for it was its status as a colonial power. It did 
whatever it could to achieve its strategy. 
  2. In November 1991, when the Paris 23 October 1991 accord 
was being implemented, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas came 
to Phnom Penh immediately to combine two parties -- one 
belonging to Ranariddh of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for 
an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] and 
the other to Hun Sen of the Vietnamese puppet Cambodian People's 
Party [CPP]. The French foreign minister's intention was to 
encroach upon the Paris accord, which demands that the four 
parties achieve national reconciliation. France was opposed to 
the Party of Democratic Kampuchea and the Supreme National 
Council headed by Prince Norodom. In connivance with its 
alliance, France assisted the Vietnamese aggressor troops to 
reinforce the communist Vietnamese regime in Cambodia, enabling 
it to smash the Democratic Kampuchea forces. French General 
Loridon, commander of the UN forces in Cambodia, said blatantly 
that the Khmer Rouge [KR] should be smashed to pieces and so on. 
  3. Along with this, France and Akashi [head of the UN 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia], as well as their alliance, 
forged a law making millions of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia 
eligible to vote. They also declared that Vietnamese nationals 
would be allowed to flow into Cambodia at will. 
  4. Shortly after the elections organized by UNTAC [UN 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia], even though the communist 
Vietnamese puppet CPP was defeated, France further strove to 
immediately combine the communist Vietnamese puppets with the 
FUNCINPEC of Ranariddh to form a two-headed government and an 
army to attack Democratic Kampuchea and the people at Phnum 
Chhat and Stoung, and then Anlung Veng and Pailin as now. In 
January 1993, the French defense minister made an urgent trip to 
Phnom Penh, and later, the French General Staff chief and 
foreign minister also came in order to join in mapping out a 
military plan to (?attack) the Cambodian nation and people in 
the Democratic Kampuchea-controlled regions during the 16th dry 
season. 
  5. Now, despite serious defeats suffered by its alliance, 
the communist Vietnamese and the two-headed government, on the 
Anlung Veng, Pailin, Route 5, Poipet, and Sisophon battlefields, 
France remains adamant on further inflaming the war of 
aggression. It has summoned Prince Sirivut -- who is now having 
a good time in Paris touring, drinking, and dancing -- to see it 
so that more military aid can be provided for destroying the 
Cambodian nation and people in accordance with the strategy 
applied by its alliance and the communist Vietnamese in Cambodia 
and the region. 
  The Cambodian nation and people as well as all patriotic 
forces are determined to continue to hold aloft the banner of 
the struggle to preserve the survival of the nation and race. 
Peace-loving countries in the region, including the ASEAN 
states, are vehemently opposed to the communist Vietnamese' and 
their alliance's policy of furthering war in Cambodia and 
Southeast Asia. They want Cambodia to recover national 
reconciliation and peace in accordance with the king's 
five-point national reconciliation plan.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 11 May (AKP) -- His Majesty Norodom 
Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, has disclosed that massive 
corruption also exists within Khmer Rouge ranks. 
  At an audience with the representatives of the losing 
parties 
in the general elections and the Muslim and the Chinese 
communities in Phnom Penh on 7 May, the king rejected an 
allegation made by some that "leaders of the FUNCINPEC [National 
United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and 
Cooperative Cambodia] Party and the Cambodian People's Party 
[CPP] are corrupt, while the Khmer Rouge [KR] are good." 
  "The revenue acquired by the Khmer Rouge from the sale of 
precious stones and logs has not been used to serve the people 
at all," said the king, adding that money pocketed by the group 
has not been spent to build schools, bridges, roads, 
monasteries, but to purchase arms and ammunition. 
  "Besides, nonscientific exploitation of the precious stones 
in Pailin accorded by the Khmer Rouge to foreign entrepreneurs 
has led to the pollution of the Sangke river and a large part of 
the Tonle Sap lake," said the king, who also denounced the 
perfidious maneuvers of the Khmer Rouge, who massacres its own 
people under the pretext of attacking Vietnam. 
  His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk calls for an end to the 
confrontation between the Khmer Rouge and other Cambodians to 
promote a climate of mutual comprehension, thereby achieving 
national reconciliation. 
  The king underlined that the internal conflict only benefits 
neighboring countries. He called on all Cambodians to accept a 
roundtable meeting or new general elections.

  [Text] Sam Rangsi, deputy chairman of the FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] Party and minister for economy and 
finance of the two- headed government, said on 8 May: I am of 
the opinion that we are not able to dissolve the Khmer Rouge 
[KR] troops. Even the North Vietnamese troops were unable to 
dissolve the KR troops. This is not only my belief; the 
overwhelming majority of the Cambodian people also thinks so. 
The people are fed up with war; no one wants to wage war to 
bleed his own fellow compatriots. Since the entire Cambodian 
people want peace, the king has called for a roundtable meeting 
to restore peace with peaceful means, (?thereby making Cambodia 
prosperous and glorious once again). This is not only my point 
of view, it is also the opinion of the people in general. 
  Sam Rangsi further said that the king's statement is very 
correct, because nothing can be resolved militarily. War should 
be put to a halt. The Vietnamese, who attacked the Khmer Rouge 
and harassed, persecuted, and oppressed the Cambodian people, 
were not able to fight a successful war against the Khmer Rouge, 
so why do we, the Cambodians, need to bleed each other? This 
only damages Cambodia's interests and benefits foreigners. The 
latter want us to bleed and kill each other to make our land 
free, thereby allowing them to dominate and occupy our country. 
This being the case: 
  1. Our common belief is that nothing can be solved through 
military means and that a solution to achieve national unity can 
only be found through peaceful negotiations. 
  2. Since all of us want peace, therefore, only the king is 
able to restore national reconciliation to allow our nation to 
recover independence and peace 100 percent.

<F P=106> [Column by Monineat: "A Very Little Hope in the Assembly </F>
Session"] 
  [Excerpt] Some observers have said they have very little 
hope in the upcoming session of the National Assembly expected 
to be held on 16 May following failure of the recent two 
sessions. Three topics will be raised on the agenda of this 16 
May session. 
  The National Assembly will hear the announcement on the 
outgoing and incoming representatives, debate and adopt the 
1994-95 socioeconomic restoration plan and the press system 
bill, and approve the appointment of Sin Sen and Kieng Vang as 
the state secretaries of Interior. 
  Looking at the three topics, one can see that this is the 
third time that the announcement on the outgoing and incoming 
representatives has been raised on the agenda. It was this 
topic that caused a deadlock in the previous two sessions (held 
on 5 and 27 April). This matter has caused the National 
Assembly to be criticized by the public and those who have been 
observing the law enforcement and the implementation of the 
half-baked democracy in Cambodia. 
  The replacement of these unqualified representatives has led 
to the conflict between personal opinions and legal aspects 
because a number of representatives from the FUNCINPEC [National 
United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and 
Cooperative Cambodia] Party have refused to accept two 
candidates from the Cambodian People's Party [CPP], namely 
Prince Kromkhun Chakkrapong and Mr. Sin Song. 
  According to a report from the National Assembly's office, 
11 
members of the assembly's Standing Committee have approved the 
agenda on the new representatives, but one Standing Committee 
member has rejected it. 
  Some optimists think that this session will be successful 
because they believe that the FUNCINPEC and CPP will reach a 
compromise so that the two representatives from the CPP can get 
their seats in the National Assembly. Howevere, there are also 
some pessimists on this matter. 
  A high-ranking National Assembly member has revealed that 
Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly, has strived 
to reach a compromise with the FUNCINPEC to draw its support for 
his men. He will also seek the support from other assembly 
members to get the approval for this agenda. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Mrs. Sam Kanitha, Deputy Minister of 
Justice, has said that a number of authorities are still 
violating the law and that she does not know whose orders they 
are following. She has information that many political prisoners 
are still being detained in many provinces and that there has 
been torture especially of members of FUNCINPEC. 
  The deputy minister stated that these authorities -- who are 
carrying on the system of the old regime -- are exceeding their 
legal authority and are a major problem for the Ministry of 
Justice. She emphasized that, "If we cannot solve this problem 
now the `sickness' will be as grave as it was before." 
  Up until now, the Ministry of Justice has been limited in 
seeking a solution to these violations because the constitution 
which regulates the power of the government is not yet set up. 
Mrs. Sam Kanitha said that, "At the present time disorder cannot 
be avoided." But, in spite of this, in accordance with special 
royal authorization from Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the Ministry 
of Justice is dispatching government attorneys to the various 
detention centers where they suspect that there are violations. 
  Mrs. Kanitha explained that, "This does not mean that we are 
separating ourselves from the government. We are following the 
orders of the chief of state because we cannot yet operate 
according to the constitution." What she termed, "those old 
laws" still seem to be widely carried out. There is something 
unusual and slow about the courts. 
  Recently we approved a memorandum for all judges to inform 
them of recent legal errors. And we began to investigate every 
legal case. We are trying to resolve every pending case before 
the new laws go into effect. We are also establishing a court of 
appeals. Up until now in Cambodia the judicial branch has not 
been independent. 
  The laws had been made according to the wishes of the 
government and no one has dared to object. In the beginning the 
Ministry of Justice had no role, but was responsible for 
approving the judgments of various government organizations such 
as the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Security, or 
provincial governors. 
  These three authorities can detain a prisoner in jail as 
they wish. The Ministry of Security, according to research by 
the Ministry of Justice, has said that the use of torture is a 
technical matter of its own. She added that the various 
decisions have been made in accordance with party policies and 
the judges have not been appointed by them for their ability but 
rather for their loyalty. One of the many current problems which 
the Ministry of Justice must solve is the lack of healthy and 
independent judges in Cambodia to go back to work when there are 
new laws. The Ministry of Justice is now asking retired lawyers 
to return to work even those who live abroad. But Mrs. Sam 
Kanitha is perfectly aware that the government's pay will not 
attract many specialists. At present, monthly salaries at the 
Ministry of Justice range from 30,000 to 60,000 riels. Since the 
Ministry of Justice does not have enough new people to change 
the old regime, it has tried to explain the new system by 
teaching its own personnel. 
  In close cooperation with United Nations agencies and human 
rights organizations, they have given many seminars to raise the 
level of education. Mrs. Sam Kanitha believes strongly that 
education is one of the ways to combat corruption. Beginning 
when she was in the Ministry of Education, she conducted 
experiments in order to combat corruption. From the beginning, 
in the schools and universities, since [they] had created an 
independent committee to monitor examinations and provide a 
secret number for the examinees, she observed that the students 
who have the ability to get good grades are not the students who 
have wealthy or powerful parents.

<F P=106> [Unattributed biography: "Biography of His Excellency Chea </F>
Sim, President of the National Assembly and Acting Head of State 
of the Kingdom of Cambodia"] 
  [Text] Samdech [His 
Excellency] Chea Sim was born on 15 November 1932 in Svay Rieng 
Province. 
  When he was young, he lived and studied at a temple. He 
became a monk and continued his studies until he had received a 
mid-level diploma in religion. 
  During 1952 to 1953 he was with the freedom movement 
struggling for national independence. 
  During the period from 1970 to 1975 he was with the movement 
for national salvation under the leadership of His Majesty 
Norodom Sihanouk, head of the United National Front for Harmony 
in Cambodia. During this period, he was named as a chairman of a 
canton administration, and later a chairman of the district 
administration. 
  In 1975, because he saw clearly the danger threatening the 
lives of the people of Cambodia, he and his group led their 
forces in resisting the genocidal regime. 
  On 2 December 1978, he was assigned to be deputy chairman of 
the United Front for Solidarity to Redeem Cambodia. 
  After the overthrow of the genocidal regime on 7 January 
1979, he was assigned to be a member of the People's 
Revolutionary Assembly of Cambodia as well as Minister of 
Interior for the Cambodian Government. 
  During the 12 years since 1981 he has been elected chairman 
of the United Front for Solidarity, Construction and Defense of 
the Cambodian Motherland; a member of the People's Assembly from 
Prey Veng Province; and chairman of the National Assembly of the 
Cambodian Government. 
  In the recent period of peace and national harmony -- which 
was brought about through the national elections held in May 
1993 under the supervision of the temporary UN authority in 
Cambodia, he was elected as a member of the assembly from Phnom 
Penh. 
  He was elected as the president of the National Assembly 
during the very first meeting of the Assembly of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia. 
  On 9 November 1993, His Majestry Norodom Sihanouk, the King 
of Cambodia, bestowed the title of samdech [excellency] on him.

  [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) announced Tuesday that it will send 
inspectors "in the next few days" to North Korea to complete 
monitoring activities begun in March. 
  Dispatch of the inspectors is conditioned on North Korea 
delaying the removal of fuel rods from its 5-megawatt reactor, 
according to a letter from IAEA Director-General Hans Blix 
addressed to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam. 
  The agency invited North Korea to send a delegation of 
experts to Vienna to discuss the inspection timetable. 
  Blix said he hopes the IAEA and the delegation can negotiate 
the necessary inspection process for the changing of the fuel 
rods. 
  The director-general emphasized in the letter that the rods 
must remain closed under IAEA seals after they are randomly 
selected, and various measurements of the rods should be 
conducted late this year, officials said. 
  The letter offers hope of a breakthrough in the nuclear 
impasse since the IAEA proposal, although it carries a 
condition, leaves aside for now the biggest stumbling block to 
an inspection agreement. 
  The IAEA inspection team, with entry visas to North Korea 
already in hand, would conduct basic checks such as replacing 
batteries and film in monitoring cameras as well as additional 
inspections of facilities that were barred to the inspectors 
during their last visit in March. 
  Blix wrote to Kim that the team would go to Pyongyang "in 
the 
next few days." 
  North Korea and the IAEA have been deadlocked over the 
inspections, with Pyongyang refusing random collection and 
measurement of the fuel rods as demanded by the agency. 
  Blix's latest proposal cautiously sidesteps this stumbling 
block by recommending that North Korea delay the refueling for 
now so that his agency can get on with other inspection 
activities first. 
  Officials here predicted that North Korea will accept this 
proposal since it meets the requirements for a third round of 
much- wanted high-level dialogue with the United States. 
  This glimmer of hope comes just days before Blix is to go 
before the UN Security Council with a report on the status of 
the North Korean nuclear row.

  [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korea threw its 
support behind China's admission to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Wednesday but emphasized that Beijing's 
trade laws should be made compatible with those of the GATT. 
  Beijing, on the other hand, asked Seoul to lift adjustment 
tariffs on agricultural products imported from China and for 
sufficient advance warning and negotiation before anti-dumping 
duties are slapped on Chinese farm goods. 
  Seoul and Beijing sat down for a second day of working-level 
trade talks here led by Chong Ui-yong, director-general for 
international trade for the South Korean side, and Shi Weisan, 
director-general for Asian affairs at the Chinese Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation Ministry. 
  Seoul supported Beijing's bid to become a GATT member while 
noting that China should conform to GATT rules on trade. 
Officials here said Seoul placed special emphasis on China's 
lowering of customs duties. 
  Seoul asked Beijing to provide information on construction 
projects and to strengthen inspection of foodstuff exports, to 
expedite completion of the Korea business center and to allow 
more Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) offices in China. 
  Seoul made it a point of demanding that China open its 
distribution market, a preliminary step to individual market 
opening. 
  Bilateral trade totaled 9.1 billion U.S. dollars last year, 
with Korea posting a 1.2-billion-dollar surplus in direct 
exchanges: The surplus is an even larger 3.3 billion dollars 
when indirect trade via third countries such as Hong Kong is 
included. 
  Officials predicted that two-way trade will increase to 28 
billion dollars by 1997 and to 50 billion dollars by the year 
2000. 
  Beijing showed keen interest in South Korea's agricultural 
market opening after conclusion of the Uruguay Round, Seoul 
officials said. 
  It specifically asked Seoul to leave room for ample 
negotiations if any possibility of anti-dumping charges arises. 
  The next round of working-level talks is scheduled for the 
first half of next year in Beijing.

  [Text] Moscow, May 11 (YONHAP) -- Russia threatens to 
reconsider its policy of cooperating with South Korea over the 
North Korean loggers' issue if South Korea tries to politically 
use the question or an overheated atmosphere keeps going in 
South Korea over the loggers' issue as now. 
  Sources at the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that 
if such a trend goes on in South Korea, Russia may totally 
reconsider its basic stand toward the question. 
  Russia earlier gave the word that it would cooperate with 
South Korea in resettling in South Korea those North Korean 
loggers who remain stranded in Russia after escaping from North 
Korea-run logging yards in Siberia. 
  The sources said the recent series of South Korean press 
reports on North Korean loggers were not factual and, besides, 
the Russian Government has been placed in a highly awkward 
position at home and abroad due to such reports. 
  "We have invited the South Korean Government's attention to 
this aspect several times in the past," they said. 
  The sources said Russia told Seoul that if South Korea, 
through its press, continues to raise clamor about the loggers 
issue, Russia may make an aboutface in its basic stand over the 
loggers' resettlement in South Korea. 
  An atmosphere, they said, is being fostered among Russia's 
security organizations for a change in Russia's policy over the 
loggers. 
  "Because of such an air, inter-office talks on procedural 
matters related to the loggers' resettlement in South Korea are 
having a hard going," they added. 
  Russian experts in Korean affairs, too, said the Russian 
Government is highly dissatisfied with the way the South Korean 
Government handles the loggers' issue. 
  They did not rule out the danger that after President Kim 
Yong- sam's visit to Russia, South Korea-Russia relations may be 
dragged into a delicate current. 
  "It is possible that an extremely small number of North 
Korean loggers could be sent to South Korea in a symbolic 
gesture before President Kim's visit to Moscow," they said. 
  "But, if an overheated atmosphere is created in South Korea 
by giving, for instance, a hero's welcome to the loggers to the 
detriment of Russia's position, there would possibly be no 
further flight of loggers to South Korea." 
  Meanwhile, those North Korean loggers stranded in Russia 
have 
cut off their contacts with the South Korean Embassy in Moscow 
following Seoul's announcement of a policy to accept them. 
  It is believed that some of the loggers might have been 
arrested by North Korean secret agents.

  [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The government will adopt 
a set of measures for North Korean loggers in Russia seeking 
refuge and settlement in South Korea. 
  The decision was made at a working-level meeting of related 
government ministries and agencies, including the National 
Unification Board, the Economic Planning Board, the Foreign, 
Home, Justice, Labor, and Information Ministries, the Agency for 
National Security Planning and the National Police Agency, 
presided over by the chief assistant to the prime minister for 
administrative coordination, Kim Si-hyong, on Tuesday. 
  Under the measures, the North Korean defectors protection 
law 
enacted in June last year will be flexibly implemented, while 
programs to help North Korean loggers settle in the South as 
soon as possible will be developed. 
  These programs will include job training and placement, 
housing assistance and security steps to ensure their safety. 
  In addition, civic organizations such as religious and 
charity groups will be encouraged to stage fund-raising 
campaigns for North Korean loggers arriving in the South. 
  The government will hold two or three more working-level 
meetings to finalize the measures, an official said. 
  For the 10 or so North Korean loggers expected to arrive in 
the South soon as negotiations with the Russian Government are 
almost completed, Seoul will provide job training to aid their 
early settlement in the South, officials said. 
  The South Korean Mission in Moscow has formed a task force 
to 
negotiate with the Russian Government on legal procedures for 
North Korean loggers traveling to the South. 
  Moscow, considering its relations with Pyongyang, has not 
yet 
set a policy on North Korean loggers seeking refuge in South 
Korea, an official said.

<F P=106> [Interview with ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae by senior </F>
KBS reporter Yi Yong-il and KBS social affairs reporter Pak 
Chan-uk at the KBS-1 Television studio in Seoul on the "News 
Focus" program; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter Yi Yong-il] How are you, Mr. Minister. 
I understand that you recently visited Japan, Russia, and 
Germany and returned home last week. Will you explain the 
results of your visit to these countries? 
  [Defense Minister Yi] As you mentioned, I visited Japan, 
Russia, and Germany for 10 days from 25 April to 5 May. The 
results of my visit can be summarized into the following three 
points. First, my visit to Russia was the first occasion for an 
ROK defense minister to visit Russia. As you know, the Russian 
Federation is the successor to the former Soviet Union, and the 
treaty for friendship and mutual assistance it concluded with 
North Korea is still valid. 
  My talks with the Russian defense minister were ultimately 
aimed at discussing measures for preventing North Korea's 
erroneous judgment and for deterring its provocation. I am not 
certain whether it is an appropriate hypothesis or not, but 
suppose that the minister of the People's Armed Forces of North 
Korea visits Washington and meets with U.S. Defense Secretary 
Perry, and they reach an agreement on a certain issue and sign 
an accord, I would certainly be uncomfortable. My talks with 
the Russian defense minister to exchange views on issues 
pertaining to security in Northeast Asia and the world were 
primarily designed to seek agreement on measures to prevent 
North Korean misjudgment and provocation. 
  Second, as you know, the most urgent issue at present is the 
North Korean nuclear problem. Our stand toward this issue is 
just. In other words, we maintain that North Korea must return 
to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] system at an early 
date for a solution to the problem. North Korea must also show 
the transparency of its nuclear issue. For this, it should 
allow complete inspections of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] and mutual inspections between North and South 
Korea so that the transparency of the nuclear problem can be 
displayed to the entire world. 
  Meeting with the defense ministers of these three countries, 
I noticed that they shared the completely same view on this 
issue. In particular, my Japanese counterpart stressed that the 
North Korean nuclear problem is not only the problem of the ROK 
but also that of his own country, and Germany also has a similar 
view. 
  Third, my visit can be reviewed based on working-level 
exchanges. Military exchanges can be categorized into two parts; 
first is manpower exchange and second is material exchange. We 
agreed to expand manpower exchanges. In other words, we agreed 
that by giving opportunities to core members of each country's 
Armed Forces to visit the other countries, we should encourage 
them to have a good understanding of the development of the 
military science and military theories of the other countries. 
This can be described as part of the results of my visit. 
  I would like to emphasize to the people at this point that 
the defense and security of the ROK assumes the ROK-U.S. 
security system as its main axis. Therefore, my recent visits 
to these countries do not mean an alienation [sooe] from or 
neglect of security relations with the United States. 
  [Reporter Yi] Reporter Pak, as you know, North Korea 
unilaterally informed the UN Forces that it will withdraw from 
the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] in Panmunjom and will 
withdraw the Polish mission from the Neutral Nations Supervisory 
Commission. As a result, people suspect the true intention 
hidden in its abrupt act. Will you tell us about how the recent 
North Korean moves have been reported by the news media? 
  [Reporter Pak] Yes. Although it can be hardly described as a 
strange act, North Korea has certainly shown abnormal acts one 
after another from some time ago, thus straining the position of 
our side. North Korea began to show such an act on 28 April. In 
a Foreign Ministry statement that day, North Korea abruptly 
proposed to the U.S. side that the present Armistice Agreement 
be replaced with a peace agreement in order to prevent a war 
from occurring on the Korean peninsula. Such an abrupt act by 
North Korea continued on the next day, too. 
  Colonel Kim Hyon-ki, senior secretary of the North Korean 
side of the MAC, proposed to Colonel Chilton of the U.S. Army, 
senior secretary of the UN Forces side of the MAC, to meet him 
as a representative of the U.S. Army, not as a representative of 
the MAC. 
  Needless to say, the U.S. Army, in a reply message, stressed 
that it refuses the North Korean side's proposal stressing that 
the North Korean demand violates the Armistice Agreement. 
  Nevertheless, North Korea soon sent a unilateral message 
that 
it will withdraw from the MAC and that it will also withdraw the 
Polish mission, a North Korean side member country of the 
Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. 
  [Reporter Yi] Was it true, reporter Pak, that the North 
Korean side deployed armed soldiers within Panmunjom? 
  [Reporter Pak] Yes, that is true. It was the afternoon of 
that day. While shifting the guards in the joint security area 
at Panmunjom, the North Korean side brought in this area about 
40 soldiers who were armed with individual weapons including 
rifles and helmets. The Armistice Agreement stipulates that 
officers may carry out their mission by carrying a pistol but 
soldiers are not permitted to arm themselves. According to the 
UN Forces Command, this was the first time since the incident of 
the brutal slaughter of American soldiers with axes took place 
in 1976. 
  On the afternoon of 30 April, North Korea staged a special 
air exercise. North Korea had about 20 fighter planes take off 
that day and stage an exercise of attacking simulated enemy 
planes. In addition, the North Korean planes flew toward the 
South farther than during the regular exercise, and approached 
the area 27 kilometers north of the armistice line, which is 
designated by our Army as the last security boundary line, thus 
making our Army tense. 
  Because of this situation, our home ministry requested each 
broadcasting station, including KBS, to stand by for emergency 
broadcast. As a result, a very strained situation was created, 
just for a while. 
  [Reporter Yi] Mr. Minister, I believe that you have received 
a series of reports on such moves by North Korea, as reporter 
Pak explained. How do you observe these situations and how our 
Army coped with them? 
  [Defense Minister Yi] I will add some explanation on the 
background. The situation North Korea is facing today is, in a 
nutshell, that North Korea is suffering three kinds of 
hardships. These are, as we all know well, economic 
difficulties, shortages of food and oil, and international 
isolation. The communist and socialist forces who supported 
North Korea in the past have all disappeared. Third, the 
hardship of decision making. If North Korea is fully opened, 
its present social system can hardly be maintained and if it 
does not open itself, it will continuously suffer its present 
economic difficulties. Thus, North Korea is faced with the pain 
of making a decision. In order for North Korea to resolve these 
triple hardships, it is using the nuclear card. In other words, 
with this nuclear card, it is trying to evade international 
isolation, to gain some economic assistance, and to maintain the 
survival of its political system. 
  Each of these situations, pointed out by reporter Pak 
earlier, are psychological tactics to be implemented by using 
the nuclear card. What has appeared clearly in North Korea's 
attempting to overcome such pains by using the nuclear card is 
its intention to isolate the ROK. In other words, North Korea 
is persistently trying to directly contact the United States and 
isolate the ROK. Therefore, all the situations that took place 
recently can be regarded as a move to isolate our ROK from 
joining in the resolution of the problems. However, we need not 
be embarrassed by such a psychological trick and strategy, if I 
may define it as such. 
  As defense minister, I am thoroughly aware of what is 
happening in North Korea, including the movement of troops, 
material, and equipment, as well as the type of exercises and 
other things. I regret that I cannot tell you all of them 
because they are military secrets. All this comes to my 
attention through the joint 24-hour intelligence surveillance 
system between the ROK and the United States. 
  In conclusion, I would like to point out that although North 
Korea is resorting to psychological tactics, it has no intention 
to trigger systematic provocations. Even if North Korea embarks 
on a systematic provocation, I will notice it immediately. 
  [Reporter Yi] What is the present status of the issue of 
resuming the Team Spirit exercise? 
  [Defense Minister Yi] I will briefly explain first about the 
nature of the Team Spirit exercise. It would be the 18th 
holding of the exercise if this year's Team Spirit exercise was 
held. This exercise is purely defensive with no offensive 
nature. If a nation has an army, it should conduct training for 
its army. It is quite natural. 
  However, with a view to joining the nation's great strategy 
for a solution to the North Korean nuclear problem, we have 
postponed four times under two conditions. During talks with 
U.S. Defense Secretary Perry who visited our country last month, 
we agreed to resume the Team Spirit exercise in November if 
positive progress is not seen in resolving the North Korean 
nuclear problem. There is no change in our position. 
  [Reporter Yi] Let us direct our attention, reporter Pak, to 
the internal affairs of our Army. Accidental discharges of 
weapons and other accidents occurred in succession recently in 
the Army. What do you think the reason for this is? 
  [Reporter Pak] As you pointed out, various accidents, 
including accidental discharges, have taken place in the Army 
recently one after another. On 3 May, a college student 
participating in reserve forces' training was killed by a bullet 
fired from an M-16 rifle, and last Saturday, four days later, 
three civilians were severely injured by the accidental firing 
of a mortar shell in the mortar firing range. Besides, three 
soldiers who were repairing an iron fence were killed by a mine 
explosion. The problem is that none of these accidents were 
clearly explained and revealed. 
  It is only 10 months ago that some 20 officers and men of 
the 
active and reserve forces were killed by the explosion of an 
artillery shell at the artillery firing range in Yonchon, 
Kyonggi Province. Another accident of an artillery shell 
landing in the playground of a high school followed late last 
year. Each time, the military authorities repeatedly stated 
that they would do their utmost to prevent further accidents. 
But their statements resulted only in the repetition of 
accidents. In view of proper weapons management being the basic 
safety principle in the Army, the recent accidents involving 
weaponry arouse the people's concern with the possible 
easy-going attitude of the Army. 
  [Reporter Yi] People are worried that such accidents may be 
an outcome of relaxed military discipline. Needless to say, the 
people trust and love the Army. However, viewing the accident 
at the reserve forces training site, the people suspect that the 
military might have attempted to conceal or not reveal the 
complete truth about the accident. What is your plan to prevent 
further accidents, including accidental discharges of weapons, 
Mr. Minister? 
  [Defense Minister Yi] I, as defense minister, want to ask 
the pardon of the people. At the same time, I express sincere 
condolences to those who were victimized in the recent 
accidents, as well as to their bereaved families. 
  I would like to point out at this point that the military 
and police are conducting a joint investigation of the accident. 
Based on the result of the investigation, I will thoroughly 
call to account those responsible for the accident and will see 
to it that appropriate follow-up actions are taken. 
  One thing for which I seek the people's understanding is 
that 
the Army is a group of young men who live together while 
handling various dangerous equipment and materials. Statistics 
from the accidents that have occurred over the past 10 years 
show a noticeable reduction in overall accidents. I will see to 
it that military discipline be further tightened among soldiers 
and those concerned. 
  [Reporter Yi] I hope that the military will continually 
enjoy 
the people's love and trust. Thank you, Mr. Minister, for 
joining us despite your busy schedule.

<F P=106> [Commentary by TONG-A ILBO Executive Director Nam Si-uk: </F>
"The Peace Treaty Offensive and the Position To Cope With It"] 
  [Text] There is something that we should take into 
consideration when discussing the peace treaty issue raised by 
North Korea. It is the Geneva peace talks held in April 1954. 
  The Geneva talks were held 40 years ago and have almost been 
forgotten. It is strange that even experts have no particular 
interest in the talks. It is necessary, however, to review the 
talks to correctly understand and properly cope with the peace 
treaty issue between North Korea and the United States. 
  The Geneva peace talks were held as a step following the 
conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement signed in July 
1953. The Armistice Agreement stipulates that representatives of 
countries concerned should hold political talks within three 
months after the effectuation of the agreement to discuss the 
withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Korean peninsula and a 
peaceful method to resolve the Korean issue and to conclude a 
proper treaty that will replace the Armistice Agreement. Since 
they discussed not only the Korean peninsula issue but also the 
peace issue on the Indo-Chinese peninsula at that time, the 
meeting was called the Geneva Far East Peace Talks. 
  Present at discussions on the Korean issue in Geneva were 
North Korea, the former Soviet Union, China, and the 16 
member-states of the United Nations, including Britain and 
France, that participated in the Korean war. In the beginning 
of the talks, Britain took the lead in discussions by presenting 
five principles for Korean reunification under the supervision 
of the United Nations. Corresponding to this, the ROK put 
forward 14 principles in a proposal that the UN troops be 
withdrawn from the Korean peninsula after the ROK has 
satisfactory results from free elections under UN supervision. 
The Soviet Union, however, presented a five-point resolution 
urging all foreign troops to be withdrawn first. North Korea 
put forward a six-point resolution demanding the establishment 
of an all-Korean committee after the withdrawal of all foreign 
troops. Because of such differences in opinion, the discussion 
on the Korean issue was ruptured about two months after it 
began. Eventually, they failed to reach agreements on the method 
of reunification and the method of concluding a peace treaty. 
  This Geneva meeting shows the following three facts: First, 
the Geneva meeting has verified the stark fact that the ROK is a 
party concerned with the Korean war armistice system. Despite 
this fact, North Korea has used tactics to exclude the ROK from 
the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] under the pretext that 
the ROK is not a signatory of the Armistice Agreement. It has 
not attended MAC meetings since the UN chief delegate of the MAC 
was recently replaced by an ROK Army officer. Now, it is even 
trying to paralyze the function of the MAC by withdrawing its 
delegates from the MAC. 
  North Korea's insistence that a certain country is a 
signatory of the Armistice Agreement and another is not is 
nothing but North Korea's propaganda because those who signed 
the Armistice Agreement were not countries, but were instead UN 
troops, North Korean troops, and the commander of the Chinese 
People's Volunteers. (There are many Koreans who believe North 
Korea's false insistence is correct.) 
  Second, the peace treaty issue should be discussed by all 
countries concerned with the war, as was so in Geneva. North 
Korea, however, has insisted on concluding a peace treaty only 
with the United States. It took no regard of the ROK. The 
South-North agreement was concluded in December 1991, but North 
Korea has not observed it. Article 5 of the South-North 
agreement stipulates that South and North Korea should make 
joint efforts to replace the present cease-fire with a "peace 
state" and should abide by the Armistice Agreement until it is 
replaced with a peace treaty. 
  Third, although we can help facilitate the holding of North 
Korea-U.S. talks and further the establishment of North 
Korea-U.S. diplomatic ties to induce the opening of North Korea, 
it is wrong for us to agree that North Korea and the United 
States hold talks over the nuclear issue and discuss the peace 
treaty issue. North Korea's insistence on discussing the nuclear 
issue only with the United States is originally absurd. It 
seems that North Korea will certainly propose the conclusion of 
a peace treaty when the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks 
are held. The U.S. Departments of Defense and State have 
different positions on this. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry said that it is 
impossible to conclude a peace treaty, but Assistant Secretary 
of State Robert Gallucci said everything can be discussed in the 
third round of talks with North Korea. We cannot figure out 
what on earth the U.S. position is. The ROK position on this is 
that the peace treaty issue should be discussed with the ROK 
first since it is a party concerned, however, the nuclear issue 
should be resolved first at the present stage. 
  As shown by the Geneva talks, a peace treaty is, in nature, 
a 
treaty that parties concerned with a war sign to put an end to 
the war and restore peace. It is different from an ordinary 
agreement between countries on friendship and cooperation 
because it is a treaty for post-war arrangements. Accordingly, 
the precedent of the Geneva peace talks should be respected in 
handling the peace treaty issue for post-Korean War arrangements. 
  By the way, these days a peace treaty is not always required 
for normalizing diplomatic relations between countries concerned 
with a war. For example, Japan and the former Soviet Union 
restored their diplomatic relations simply by issuing a joint 
declaration on it, but have not yet concluded a peace treaty. 
The United States and China signed a peace treaty four years 
after the establishment of diplomatic ties, and Japan and China 
did the same. Accordingly, the conclusion of a peace treaty is 
not necessary for establishing diplomatic relations between 
North Korea and the United States. North Korea's hidden purpose 
is to raise the issue of withdrawing U.S. forces in Korea. 
  The government must invariably push ahead with the policy 
that the peace treaty issue should be resolved by South and 
North Korea in accordance with the South-North agreement, not by 
North Korea and the United States, and must try to convince the 
United States to agree to the policy. At the same time, the 
government should make efforts to let the people know the nature 
of the peace treaty issue. Some naive young people stand 
inwardly on the North Korean side, wondering what is wrong with 
the North Korean proposal for replacing the Armistice Agreement 
with a peace treaty with the United States. The government has 
the responsibility to help create a righteous public opinion in 
the country, doesn't it?

  [Text] It has been learned on 8 May that the headquarters 
of the ROK Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] is positively examining 
putting its cooperative duties with the U.S. forces in written 
form. This is in regards with U.S. reinforcements that are to be 
deployed to areas of the ROK Second Army in the event of an 
emergency and to protect related equipment. 
  The step was taken upon the request made by the U.S. forces 
in the ROK in early April to put into written form the ROK-U.S. 
consultations on the ROK Second Army's wartime operations. The 
Second Army, which controls most of the rear with over 100,000 
force-in-beings and one million reserves, covers the broadest 
area among the three ROK Armies.

  [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam has 
reiterated that there will be no amendments to the constitution 
during his term in office, Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik 
said Wednesday. 
  "There is not the slightest change in my thinking that the 
constitution will not be amended during my term of office," Chu 
quoted the president as saying. 
  The president's statement came after a press report that the 
21st Century Commission, a presidential advisory body, on 
Wednesday broached the issue of a constitutional amendment. 
  "Prof. Yi Sang-u, chairman of the 21st Century Commission, 
apparently made no mention of the alleged need for a 
constitutional amendment when he verbally reported on the 
results of the commission's study to the president on Tuesday," 
said Chu. 
  Reference to a constitutional amendment could have been made 
in a five-volume written report to the president, Chu said. 
  "(But) If a sensitive problem like a constitutional 
amendment 
was verbally reported (by Yi), the president would have reacted 
right there," Chu said. 
  "The president would have said there will be no 
constitutional amendment," Chu added.

  [Text] Seoul yesterday asked Beijing to allow the import 
of South Korean cars and participation of its construction firms 
in major construction projects in China, the Foreign Ministry 
said. 
  South Korea also requested that China heighten transparency 
of its trade system by lowering tariffs and relaxing 
requirements for permission to import goods, it said. 
  While promising to positively study the Korean suggestions, 
Beijing, on its part, urged Seoul to remove tariffs on 20 
Chinese goods including mushrooms and asked it to be more 
prudent in levying anti-dumping charges against Chinese 
products,the ministry said. 
  The two sides made the requests during the first-day of 
their 
two-day working-level trade talks. 
  The ministry said the two sides expressed satisfaction over 
the growing trade volume between the two countries and agreed to 
exert efforts to remove nontariff barriers in order to further 
expand bilateral trade. 
  According to ministry statistics, two-way trade between both 
countries amounted to $9.08 billion last year, with Korea 
recording $1.2 billion of trade surplus. 
  The two countries, in the meeting, projected their two-way 
trade would reach $28 billion in 1997 and $50 billion in 2000. 
  The Korean side also explained to the Chinese the damage 
that 
Korean farmers are suffering from growing agricultural imports 
from China and sought the understanding of the Chinese over this 
problem, the ministry said. 
  The two sides will each explain their foreign trade policies 
and discuss cooperation in regional and international trade 
organizations including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) forum and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) at today's session, the ministry said. 
  Chong Ui-yong, director-general for international trade of 
the ministry, is heading the Korean delegation, while Shi Wei 
San, chief of the Asia bureau at the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation, is leading the Chinese side.

  [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The Taiwanese Government 
decided Wednesday to lift restrictions on fruit imports, paving 
the way for South Korea to resume exports of apples and pears to 
Taiwan as soon as late this year, the Korea Trade Promotion 
Corp. (Kotra) said. 
  South Korea had exported about 30 million dollars worth of 
apples and pears to Taiwan while importing the same amount in 
bananas from that nation until August 1992, when the two 
countries severed diplomatic ties. 
  The decision to open its market to apples, pears, grapes and 
peaches is part of Taiwan's efforts to preclude possible 
problems in joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), which champions free trade. Kotra said Taiwan must join 
GATT this year if it wants to become a member of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), which replaces GATT next year. 
  The Taiwanese Government will allocate a 20,000-ton import 
quota for apples this year to those countries which have been 
previously excluded from the quota system, according to Kotra. 
Only the United States and Canada had been allowed to export 
apples to Taiwan. 
  Taiwan plans to expand the quota to 30,000 tons next year 
and 
to 50,000 tons in 1999 before allowing a free flow of apples 
into the country in 2000, Kotra said. 
  The Taiwanese Government will also allocate a 2,000-ton 
import quota for pears to Asian countries in 1995 and expand the 
quota to 4,000 tons by 2000, Kotra said. 
  Seoul and Taipei have been negotiating the resumption of 
apple and pear exports to Taiwan since January, when the 
Taiwanese established a liaison office in the South Korean 
capital.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, May 11 (YONHAP) -- Argentine Economic 
Minister Domingo Cavallo will visit South Korea early next week. 
  He will sign an agreement guaranteeing investments between 
South Korea and Argentina as well as discuss further investment 
by Korean companies in the Latin American country and loans from 
Seoul. 
  Cavallo, who is a strong advocate of his country's new 
economic policy, told YONHAP News Agency Tuesday that the 
convertibility system, which has laid the foundation for 
economic stability, will not be changed even after President 
Carlos Saul Menem is re-elected. 
  Argentina's economy has been stable for the past two to 
three 
years and the present policy will be continued; the Argentine 
Government hopes that Korean companies will hike their 
investments, he said. 
  He pointed to the fisheries, timber, mining and energy 
industries as promising areas for further Korean investment.

<F P=106> [First of two installments of article by Kim Yong-yun, </F>
doctor of economics, a research committee member at the Research 
Institute for National Unification: "North Korea's Economic 
Scale and the Volume of Goods Transferred"] 
  [Excerpts] Natsuo Sekigawa, a typical Japanese intellectual 
and writer of the postwar generation, visited North Korea three 
times beginning in 1987, not by invitation, but at his own 
expense. 
  During his trips, he induced his retinue to express their 
candid impressions of North Korea and later he wrote a book 
about the real situation in North Korea on the basis of these 
impressions. The book is titled "Dreary Maze: Real Picture of 
North Korea" 
  In this book Sekigawa describes the Pyongyang-Wonsan 
Expressway on which he travelled for the first time as follows: 
"The highway to Wonsan can hardly be called an expressway. It 
looked something like thick concrete plates randomly laid out. 
It seemed that not enough gravel was laid on the road bed. It 
was impossible to drive at a high speed because the car rattled 
at each seam in the road." However, we are more interested in 
the following description. 
  "As is in Pyongyang, we did not see even a single gas 
station all the way to Wonsan. We traveled both ways in the 
afternoon on weekdays, but the volume of traffic was very light. 
There was not much traffic in Pyongyang, but even less on the 
way to Wonsan. I counted the number of cars driving in the 
opposite lane, and the number was about 300 for a time period 
of slightly over three hours. On the way back the number was 
nearly double, but most of the vehicles were spotted near 
Pyongyang." 
  Sekigawa noted that there were very few loaded trucks. 
According to him, "On our way back to Pyongyang from Wonsan, we 
saw 10 or more trucks loaded with lumber, and there were only a 
small number of trucks also. A truck with its cargo compartment 
covered passed by on the opposite lane. There was no way of 
knowing whether the truck was loaded or not. The rest of the 
trucks were either empty or carried passengers. Not a single 
long-distance bus was seen." 
  Sekigawa says the situation was much the same when he 
visited North Korea in 1991, four years after his first visit 
in 1987. He says that during his last visit he noticed that the 
volume of traffic on the Wonsan-Pyongyang expressway (a simple 
paved highway for motor vehicles in his words) had rather 
decreased. 
  He could see about 30 vehicles passing in the opposite lane 
during a drive of slightly less than three hours over a 200 
kilometer distance. About half of them were empty trucks, and 
some of the trucks carried passengers. 
  Sekigawa says he could not spot even a single long-distance 
van, and the sights outside viewed from his car were very much 
the same as he had seen during his first trip. He saw many 
vehicles standing in the countryside--apparently broken down. 
Oxen were tilling the fields; only a few tractors were at work 
in the paddies; and on the street some tractors were carrying 
passengers in trailers. From the scanty movement of freight, he 
could tell that very few products made on the east coast were 
shipped to the west coast. 
  South Korean journalists who visited Pyongyang to cover the 
International Parliamentary Union [IPU] general meeting in 1991 
also reported seeing very few cargo-carrying trucks during the 
600-kilometer round trip on the Pyongyang-Wonsan-Kaesong-Mt. 
Kumgang route, particularly on the Pyongyang-Wonsan expressway. 
Other travelers visiting North Korea have given similar 
impressions of the expressways in North Korea. 
  Each time I come across these travel accounts about North 
Korea, I always wonder how the volume of goods transported 
could be so little. This skepticism intensifies all the more 
when I compare it with the scale of North Korea's national 
income. 
  As of 1991, North Korea's per capita national income, 
computed in the same way we compute our GNP, is estimated at 
$1,038, and its per worker GNP at $2,271. The $1,038 per capita 
income is equivalent to South Korea's 1977 per capita income. 
  It is problematical to compare the scales of the economies 
of the North and South in terms of the size of the national 
income or fiscal expenditure. North Korea's 1991 fiscal scale 
($17.2 billion) corresponds to somewhere between the comparable 
figures of South Korea's 1980 and 1981 budgets. However, there 
is too large a gap between the figures cited above and the 
volume of goods transported in North Korea actually observed by 
travelers. 
  North Korea's land transportation system gives more weight 
to freight transportation than to passenger transportation. The 
North Korean authorities explain that with the gradual increase 
in the transportation of raw materials and supplies needed in 
economic development, the importance of passenger 
transportation has decreased. They also say that given its weak 
foreign exchange position, North Korea had no alternative but 
to expand and develop railway transportation, powered by coal 
and electricity, so that it could conserve oil, the supply of 
which depends wholly on imports. 
  Still, the volume of goods transported in North Korea that 
could be inferred on the basis of actual observations by 
travelers is way too small compared with the scale of the North 
Korean economy as projected by its per capita national income. 
This raises doubts as to the validity of the estimated per 
capita national income of North Korea. [passage omitted] 
  Even where most materials are transported by rail as in 
North Korea, when railway transportation is inadequate, 
naturally road transportation is bound to come into play to 
compensate. This is the basic universal economic principle of 
seeking efficiency that applies all economic systems alike. 
  North Korea's expressway system crosses the country coast to 
coast connecting Nampo and Wonsan on the one hand, and on the 
other runs from north to south linking Huichon and Kaesong, 
with Pyongyang as its center. North Korea had its own reason 
for connecting these cities by expressways: the purpose was to 
connect these industrial areas and ports to Pyongyang. With 
Pyongyang as its axis, the expressway system connects Pyongyang 
to Nampo Port to the west; Wonsan Port to the east, behind 
which lie the Hamhung and Hungnam metallurgical and chemical 
industrial areas; and Huichon, the center of the precision 
machine and automobile industries, to the north. 
  The recently completed Kaesong-Pyongyang expressway in the 
northern part is playing the role of a passage to Pyongyang 
from South Korea. In other words, the North Korean expressways 
connect the areas that need to be developed as an essential 
requirement and on a priority basis in order to link different 
industrial centers. 
  Entry to modern society means entry to an automobile-based 
society. As industry develops, automotive transportation of 
goods and personnel becomes all the more important. North 
Korea's expressways could prove as efficient as railways as a 
means of transportation. But that did not happen, and this may 
indirectly prove that there is a big gap between the actual 
scale of the North Korean economy and our estimate of it.

  [Excerpts] As of 1991, North Korea had 5,059 kilometers of 
railway trackage, or 78 percent of 6,462 kilometers in South 
Korea. In North Korea, 3,280 kilometers, or 65 percent of the 
total length of railways, were electrified. The rate of 
electrification is high compared with South Korea. Nevertheless 
North Korea's railways are not playing their proper role. 
  First, 98 percent of the railways in North Korea are 
single-track. Regardless of improvements made in the efficiency 
of transportation on single-track railways through 
electrification, the more North Korea depends on railways for 
long-distance freight transportation, the more frequently the 
trains need to operate (dependency on railways in freight 
transportation is said to have risen from 88 percent in 1988 to 
90 percent in 1992). The greater the frequency of train 
operation, the greater the number of intermediate stations 
needed, and consequently, the longer the stoppage-time required. 
Therefore, the efficiency of electric rail transport is bound 
to fall, despite electrification's purpose having been to 
improve the speed of train runs. When freight transportation 
depends so much on single-track railways, any distribution 
system North Korea has is far from adequate. [passage omitted] 
  According to So Yong-chol, a former North Korean guard and 
guide for south-bound spy missions who defected to the South 
across the armistice line in September 1989, "between Kaesong 
and Wonsan there is no means of transportation other than the 
railway. The train leaves Kaesong for Pyongyang at 1845 daily." 
  It is hardly understandable why there is only one train run 
a day between Pyongyang and Kaesong, if we assume that 
materials are transported and delivered in North Korea in a 
quantity commensurate with the scale of the North Korean 
economy. The trains should run far more frequently. As of 1991, 
the total length of expressways in North Korea was 354 
kilometers and the total number of motor vehicles was 270,000 
(there are 4.25 million in South Korea). 
  Assuming one-tenth of these vehicles, that is, 27,000 are on 
the Pyongyang-Nampo, Pyongyang-Wonsan, Pyongyang-Kaesong, and 
Pyongyang- Huichon expressways, linking major industrial areas 
and urban centers, simple arithmetic indicates that about four 
vehicles should be seen on these expressways for each 100 
meters. Supposing trucks run on the expressways at 60 
kilometers per hour, at least 2,000 trucks could be seen per 
hour. Granting that the North Korean authorities are limiting 
the operation of trucks in order to prevent increases in oil 
imports, the volume of materials transported that can be 
projected from the actual observations of the defectors and 
travellers provides sufficient ground to raise doubts about the 
actual scale of the North Korean economy. [passage omitted] 
  North Korea's explanation of [the lack of traffic and 
activity in Pyongyang] is rather ironical. They say that the 
stores in North Korea play the role of a distributor who 
distributes goods to local inhabitants, instead of keeping 
stocks of goods on a regular basis so that he might sell 
articles to the customers from time to time as they come. 
People come to pick up their items at a given time when those 
items are available; that is why on ordinary days there are 
very few customers visiting the stores. If this is true, we 
cannot but be curious about whether there are sufficient means 
of transportation necessary to distribute all the daily 
necessities and whether such means are in an operational 
condition. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The Shameless Behavior of </F>
Splittists"] 
  [Text] The South Korean puppets are further revealing 
their splittist nature. On 6 May traitor Kim Yong-sam appeared 
in the site celebrating the so-called workers' day. At the 
site, babbling that we are continuing instigation activities 
toward the South without renouncing a nuclear development 
program and that we are pointing long-range missiles at the 
South he clamored that the South Korean people should renounce a 
dreamy view on reunification. 
  On 7 May Yi Hong-ku, minister of the puppet unification 
board, held a so-called unification and security policy 
coordination meeting. At the meeting he clamored that it will 
be inevitable for the UN Security Council to impose sanctions in 
case we refuse to accept additional inspections, that stern 
countermeasures should be taken, that an international alliance 
system will be further strengthened, and the like. He also 
urged us to observe the Armistice Agreement, like a thief 
turning on their owner, and expressed the will to oppose a new 
system for guaranteeing peace that we have proposed recently. 
  These shameless remarks by traitor Kim Yong-sam and rascal 
Yi 
Hong-ku which reverse black and white are none other than the 
splittists' sophistry which makes the world's people laugh. 
Traitor Kim Yong-sam clamored that our missiles are aiming at 
them. He carries his distortion of facts too far. Who aims at 
whom? 
  Everyone knows that over 1,000 nuclear weapons deployed in 
South Korea today are aimed at our Republic on a continuous 
basis. Patriot missiles and Apache attack helicopters which were 
introduced from the United States recently are now deployed in 
the central frontline sector near the Military Demarcation Line. 
At the same time with the deployment of these weapons, U.S. 
Defense Secretary Perry came to South Korea and returned home 
after reaffirming on the spot the preparedness for attack by 
U.S. forces and the South Korean puppet army. 
  Such being the situation, traitor Kim Yong-sam's behavior is 
too shameless. What we cannot but see more seriously is that he 
urged the South Korean people to renounce their view on 
reunification, babbling that it is a dreamy one. This shows 
that traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks that he would make every 
effort to achieve national reconciliation and reunification and 
to build a peaceful, reunified fatherland by uniting the divided 
fatherland into one are an out- and-out lie. This also shows 
that he is not interested in the country's reunification at all. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a more vicious splittist and 
flunkeyist nation-seller than successive military fascist 
dictators. 
  Next, as soon as he assumed the post of the puppet 
unification board, the rascal Yi Hong-ku held a so-called 
unification and security policy coordination meeting. At the 
meeting he clamored about sanctions against us at the UN 
Security Council, the international alliance system, and the 
like. Although he is the minister of the board, he completely 
revealed that he is a national traitor and splittist who, 
regarding the nation as an enemy, is driving the country into 
permanent division. 
  As was already reported on 3 May, answering questions raised 
by reporters, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that proceeding 
from our consistent position to show the irreproachability 
[kyolbaeksong] of our nuclear activities under the special 
position in which we have temporarily suspended the taking 
effect of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty, we have not only decided to conduct the replacement of 
fuel rods this time thoroughly under the surveillance of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], but also immediately 
issued entry visas for the five inspection members suggested by 
the agency. At the same time, we have made clear that all fuel 
rods replaced will be placed under the control of the IAEA and 
that measuring them will be permitted at a time when the nuclear 
issue is settled in a package deal at DPRK- U.S. talks in the 
future. 
  This is an expression of our Republic's greatest generosity 
and sincerity. This is why the broad social opinion of the 
world positively appraises this proposal of ours and why it is 
urging the United States not to cling to pressure but to 
sincerely come to the table of the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  This notwithstanding, Yi Hong-ku is still taking a hostile 
attitude toward us by clamoring about sanctions, the cooperation 
system, and the like. This is indeed an antinational and 
antireunification crime. 
  With regard to Yi Hong-ku's remarks that urged us to observe 
the Armistice Agreement while opposing our peace-guaranteeing 
proposal, it is not us but the United States and the South 
Korean puppets who has violated the Armistice Agreement. The 
peace in Korea has been in danger because the United States has 
been reinforcing its force of arms in South Korea for more than 
40 years since the Armistice Agreement was signed, and because 
the South Korean puppets are perpetrating the new war 
provocation maneuvers together with the United States. 
  Meanwhile, the present armistice mechanism can play no role 
in preventing a new war on the Korean peninsula at all. This is 
why we have put forward a proposal for a new system of 
guaranteeing peace. Nevertheless, opposing this proposal, the 
puppets are calling for us to observe the Armistice Agreement. 
This is indeed a reversed logic. 
  All facts mentioned above reveal once again that the South 
Korean authorities are vicious splittists and bellicose elements 
seeking only confrontation and war. These rascals will receive 
due stern judgment from our people without fail.

KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
recently at a party in "Chongwadae" contended that the 
reunification of the country is "fantasy," "unification concept 
must be discarded." 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says no one but a 
separatist dead set against reunification can make such remarks. 
  The news analyst says: 
  It is crystal-clear that the traitor Kim Yong-sam wants a 
permanent division of the country and fratricidal war, not 
reunification and peace. 
  It is a never-to-be-condoned crime for him to block 
reunification desired by the nation and drive the chariot of 
permanent division for the sake of his personal ease and power. 
  The South Korean people have concluded once again that the 
reunification of the country is impossible as long as the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam is left alone. 
  For the reunification of the country, the supreme desire of 
the nation, the Kim Yong-sam group of separatists must be 
removed as early as possible. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam must look straight at the trend of 
the nation toward reunification, give up the anti-reunification, 
separatist moves, step down and face judgement by history as 
demanded by all people.

<F P=106> ["Open Apology for Nuclear Development by S. Korean </F>
Authorities Demanded" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- "The South Korean 
rulers, if they truly want to turn the Korean peninsula into a 
nuclear-free, peace zone, must acknowledge, though belatedly, 
that their heavy water reactor, multipurpose research reactor 
and fast breeder reactor are for developing nuclear weapons, and 
apologize for this at home and abroad, and take a step to scrap 
them," said Chang Chae- chol, chairman of the C.C. [Central 
Committee], the Korean Roman Catholics Association, in a 
statement on Tuesday. 
  Noting that Kim Yong-sam the traitor recently concluded an 
agreement with Japan on a joint nuclear development and is 
hastening the development of a fast breeder reactor, the 
statement said: 
  "The development of nuclear weapons in South Korea has 
assumed a full-fledged scale because the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, applying a double standard, has connived at the 
puppets' development of nuclear arms which has actually reached 
a dangerous stage, not publishing even the inspection results, 
while taking issue with the DPRK's nuclear facilities for a 
peaceful purpose. 
  "Not contented with the introduction of over 1,000 pieces of 
U.S. nuclear weapons, which have turned South Korea into the 
largest nuclear depot in the Far East, the Kim Yong-sam group is 
stepping up the development of nuclear weapons by itself. This 
is an unpardonable heinous anti-national crime. 
  "I call upon all the Roman Catholics and Catholic 
communities 
and people of conscience of the world to pay due attention to 
the nuclear development in South Korea and lift up voices of 
justice denouncing it," the statement concluded.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique staged naval manoeuvres, an anti-aircraft and 
anti-warship exercise, a naval vessels-dispersing exercise, etc. 
in the West Sea of Korea on May 9 as part of "joint tactical 
exercises in the first half of the year" with the mobilization 
of a large-scale "naval training fleet" comprising various types 
of battleships, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  The puppet clique plan to continue till May 14 massive 
military manoeuvres directed against the North on the sea and 
ground and in the air including a training of free mobility 
offensive and defensive battles and an anti-aircraft exercise in 
the waters of the West Sea of Korea, a joint electronic warfare 
exercise of the puppet navy and air force and a landing and 
surprise attack exercise of the puppet navy and army. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, bent on confrontation and 
division, are driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to 
the brink of war by staging such military exercises one after 
another.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Kang Yong-hun, president 
of the South Korean puppet Red Cross, in his "Address on the 
World Red Cross Day" on May 9 turned down again the North's 
demand for the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, 
alleging that "they are not prisoners of war to be repatriated", 
a radio report from Seoul said. 
  This is an unreasonable attitude casting a chill on the 
public opinion at home and abroad calling for their repatriation. 
  They were taken prisoners by a bewligerent party during the 
Korean war, while serving the People's Army and the guerrilla 
unit. So, they should have been sent back to the North when POWs 
were exchanged right after the ceasefire. 
  Kang Yong-hun's remarks are a far-fetched argument and a 
wanton violation of international law. 
  Still more serious is that he brought forward the issue of 
the return of the crew of the ship "Tongjin" who were captured 
when they infiltrated into the waters of the North for 
espionage. The issue has nothing to do with the repatriation of 
Kim In-so and Ham Se- hwan. 
  Their repatriation is an issue on POWs. So, the two issues 
are quite different from each other. 
  The South Korean puppet clique are obliged to immediately 
send ohem back to the North both from the view of the 
international law and humanitarianism. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must immediately send them back to 
the 
North where their families and relatives are living, as required 
by international law and public opinion at home and abroad, 
instead of blocking their repatriation by raising unjustifiable 
conditions.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- Kim In-so's eldest 
daughter Kim Hwa-sim and Ham Se-hwan's sister Ham Suk-nyo wrote 
to the International Committee of the Red Cross, calling for a 
vigorous campaign to save Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who are now 
detained in South Korea after a long prison life without 
ideological conversion. 
  Kim Hwa-sim is a university teacher in Pyongyang. She was 
five years old when she saw her father last and is now near 50. 
Ham Suk- nyo, above 80, lives in Ongjin county, South Hwanghae 
Province. 
  In her letter, Kim Hwa-sim said: 
  "My father was arrested by the enemy while active as a 
guerrilla (militiaman) in South Korea during the last Korean 
war. He was kept in prison in South Korea for 33 years and 
seven months for the mere reason that he refused ideological 
conversion. Though released, he is not allowedi to return home 
where his flesh and blood are waiting. 
  "The South Korean side's allegation that `Kim In-so is not a 
prisoner of war, so cannot be repatriated,' is sophism ignoring 
international law on prisoners of war and contradicting reason 
and principle. 
  "The fact that my father was an unconverted long-term 
prisoner and he sent a letter to the international committee of 
the Red Cross last year, asking for help in his repatriation to 
the northern half of Korea, shows that he does not want to live 
in South Korea but earnestly hopes to return to the North where 
his children live. 
  "I ask the international committee of the Red Cross which 
defends human rights and regards the humanitarianism of Red 
Cross as its life and soul to launch an active international 
campaign so that my father can be returned in a short time to 
the northern half of the country where his family lives." 
  In her letter, Ham Suk-nyo said: 
  "My brother Ham Se-hwan who had been arrested during the war 
was excluded from the exchange of prisoners of war after the 
ceasefire. He was kept in prison for 34 years for his refusal to 
be converted. After his release, he is eking out a bare 
existence as a sick man above 60 away from home with no one to 
take care of him. 
  "Those in charge of the Red Cross in South Korea do not 
comply with the demand of the DPRK Red Cross society for his 
repatriation, alleging that he does not belong to the category 
of prisoners of war. I earnestly ask your committee to launch 
an active international campaign for his repatriation."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Ex-war correspondent of 
the Korean People's Army Yi In-mo who was embraced in the bosom 
of the DPRK on March 19, 1993, sent a letter of sympathy today 
to Kim Chi-hyon, the eldest daughter of Kim Pyong-chu, his old 
comrade-in-arms, who is suffering from a serious illness in 
South Korea. 
  Kim Pyong-chu was an old comrade-in-arms of Yi In-mo, who 
together with Yi fought for the reunification of the country 
during the fatherland liberation war (June 1950-July 1953) and 
Kim and his daughter looked after Yi In-mo with utmost care in 
South Korea. 
  In the letter Yi said that, reading an article by Yim 
Su-kyong, "the flower of reunification", carried by NODONG 
SINMUN, he learned that Kim Chi-hyon who is in the hospital 
attached to the Hanyang University for her serious illness was 
going to leave the hospital, worried about the doctor's fee and 
her younger brothers, though her illness is severe. 
  Yi said he still remembers the days when Kim Chi-hyon washed 
his face and put spoonfuls of thin rice gruel into his mouth for 
two months, temporarily leaving her work. "My diseases over 
which you were so much concerned have been completely cured like 
a miracle in Pyongyang and I am even making a tour in health," 
Yi said, and continued: 
  "It is the dear leader General Kim Chong-il who called me 
the 
incarnation of faith and will, me who was called by prisoner 
number instead of my name in prisons of South Korea, took all 
measures so that I could be embraced in the bosom of the DPRK, 
took the utmost measures for medical treatment when I returned 
to Pyongyang and is showing deep loving care for me." 
  Noting that the bright rays of the great love of dear 
general 
Kim Chong-il have reached Kim Chi-hyon, Yi In-mo stressed: "The 
DPRK is now making every possible effort to bring your brothers 
and you who are suffering from diseases in poverty, treated 
coldly for the mere reason that your father was an unconverted 
long-term prisoner who was taken prisoner while active as a 
guerrilla, and to give you medical treatment and look after you". 
  Yi said they should fight it out with confidence, earnestly 
appealing to the South Korean Red Cross and other human rights 
organisations to help them come to the North and get medical 
care.

International Issues: DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman" -- KCNA 
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK 
Foreign Ministry answered a question put by KCNA today on the 
U.S. efforts to force the Arab countries to lift their economic 
sanctions against Israel. "We cannot but raise a question about 
such behaviour of the United States," he said. 
  "Making frequent visits to Mideast countries in late April 
and early May, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher put 
pressure on Arab countries to withdraw their economic sanctions 
against Israel," the spokesman noted, and went on: 
  "While trying to get economic sanctions lifted on Israel 
which is threatening peace in the Middle East with nuclear 
weapons, the United States is blaring that "sanctions" will be 
taken against the DPRK which has no nuclear weapons in 
actuality. This is a reversed logic and the undisguised 
application of double standard to the international relations. 
  "This contradictory act of the United States makes it plain 
that the `nuclear issue' over which it is raising a hue and cry 
is a fiction invented by it for the sinister political aim of 
isolating and stifling the DPRK. 
  "The United States must not apply a double standard to the 
solution of international issues including the nuclear issue. 
  "The world people will approach with high vigilance the 
unjust act of the United States which is trying to impose its 
unilateral assertion on others, ignoring the stand of the 
parties concerned, styling itself the international police."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- A resolution was adopted 
at the 1994 meeting of Christians for Peace and Reunification of 
Korea held in Washington over April 19-21 under the sponsorship 
of the Federation of Korean Churches for Peace, Justice and 
Reunification. 
  It urged the United States to take such steps for detente as 
the cancellation of the deployment of Patriot missiles in South 
Korea and a final stop to the Team Spirit joint manoeuvres and 
apply a fair nuclear nonproliferation standard to all the 
nations so that the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and 
the world may be promoted. 
  Noting that the issue of "nuclear inspection" of the North 
must be treated as part of the plan for denuclearizing the whole 
of the Korean peninsula, the resolution contended that it must 
contain the verification of the withdrawal of the U.S. nuclear 
weapons from South Korea and the U.S. promise not to use 
regional or strategic nuclear weapons and not to threaten the 
use of such weapons against North Korea. 
  The resolution stressed that the crisis of the Korean 
peninsula must be resolved only through diplomatic negotiation, 
not by threat, "sanctions" or force of arms.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- Choe Yong-su, chief of 
the Organisation of Korean Residents in Russia, demanded the 
withdrawal of the U.S. Forces from South Korea in a statement 
supporting the appeal of the Central Committee of the Democratic 
Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland to the 70 million 
fellow countrymen to avert the danger of a nuclear war and pave 
the way for peace of the country and its peaceful reunification. 
  "The basic cause of the danger of war in Korea and national 
division lies in the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK and 
its domination and interference in South Korea," he noted, and 
said: "The U.S. authorities must stop maneuvering to stifle the 
DPRK and encouraging the South Korean authorities and 
immediately withdraw from South Korea, taking along their forces 
and nuclear weapons." 
  "The danger of war created on the Korean peninsula today is 
an inevitable offspring of the treacherous policy of the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique which has sought only confrontation and 
war, discarding independence, the life and soul of the nation, 
and dreaming the anachronistic dream of `unification through 
Northward invasion'", he stated, and said: 
  "The South Korean authorities blocked the progress of the 
DPRK- U.S. talks by deliberately breaking up the working contact 
for the exchange of special envoys between the North and the 
South and are openly agitating a war against the North, crying 
for `chastisement' and `an opportunity of unification'". 
  He called upon all the parties, groupings and people of 
broad 
sections in South Korea and overseas compatriots to rise up as 
one in the struggle to remove the treacherous forces pursuing 
the policy of depending on outside forces and defend the 
independence of the nation.

<F P=106> ["Japanese Naval `Self-Defence Force' Brings Fleet Close to </F>
Korean Peninsula" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Naval 
"Self- Defence Force" is reportedly moving its fleet to Kure 
Port in the western part of Japan from Yokosuka Port on the 
Pacific Coast. 
  The U.S. paper DEFENSE NEWS May 9, reporting this, said that 
this is designed to make a thrust without difficulty on the East 
Sea of Korea "in case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Japan Defense Agency officials tried to find an excuse 
for this, saying that "part of the warships are being 
transferred because of a jam at Yokosuka Port", but military 
experts view that the transfer of the fleet was aimed at an easy 
access of the fleet of Japan to the East Sea waters of Korea in 
"the event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula, the paper 
said. 
  The paper disclosed that the Japanese Dietmen are expected 
to 
deliberate on an amendment to the "law on the Self-Defence 
Forces" allowing the deployment of Armed Forces on the Korean 
peninsula under the pretext of protecting the Japanese residents 
in South Korea in "the event of contingency" on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The Japanese reactionaries are now steeped in the moves to 
stifle the DPRK in league with the United States over the 
"nuclear issue" of the DPRK, working hard to realise its design 
to stage a comeback to Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 8 (KNS-KCNA) -- Japanese young people 
have denounced the U.S anti-DPRK moves. 
  A resolution condemning the U.S. moves against the 
Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea was adopted at the Tokyo Youth Study 
Session for Solidarity Between Japan and Korea held on April 25. 
  Noting that the United States was increasing military threat 
and economic pressure against the DPRK and creating tension in 
Northeast Asia, it called for a continuous movement for the 
denuclearization of Northeast Asia. 
  On April 28, representative members of the executive 
committee of the Japan Youth and Students Festival for Peace and 
Friendship called at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo and strongly 
demanded that the United States immediately decide to 
discontinue the Team Spirit joint manoeuvres, stop the 
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea, put an end to 
military exercises and provocations, threat and antagonism 
against the DPRK and seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear 
issue through dialogue. 
  They staged a protest in front of the South Korean puppet 
embassy in Tokyo.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held in 
Pyongyang to mark the 40th anniversary of the publication of the 
famous work of the great leader President Kim Il-song "On the 
Immediate Tasks of the Workers in the Field of Transport". 
  President Kim Il-song published the famous work at a 
conference of model transport workers on May 11, 1954, 40 years 
ago. In the work he reviewed the successes and experiences 
gained by the railway transport workers during the war (June 
1950-July 1953) and put forward highly important tasks to 
develop railway transport after the ceasefire. 
  Yi Yong-mu, chairman of the Transport Commission, in his 
report said the great leader's work served as an inspiring 
banner in powerfully arousing all the transport workers to 
performing shining feats again in the postwar rehabilitation and 
construction in the same spirit and stamina as was displayed in 
the wartime. 
  The great leader made sure that May 11, 1954, was set as the 
day of railway workers, which marked an occasion in bringing 
about an epoch-making turn in the development of railway 
transport, and has shown deep trust and loving care to railway 
transport workers, he said. 
  He stressed that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il set 
forth a policy of making revolution in transport and led the 
whole party, the whole country and the entire people to give a 
powerful assistance to the railway transport so as to further 
strengthen the material and technical foundations of railways 
and thereby effected a new revolutionary upswing in the railway 
transport. 
  He called upon all the railway transport workers to work 
with 
the conviction of sure victory and firm will in the same 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude as was 
displayed by the transport workers during the war and achieve 
brilliant success in the fulfilment of the first year tasks of 
the period of adjustment to add lustre to the Korean-style 
socialism centred on the popular masses.

  [Text] Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of the 
Korea People's Army [KPA], sent messages of thanks to soldiers 
of the KPA unit to which Comrade Han Chae-sun belongs, soldiers 
and workers of the unit to which Comrade Na Ui-pong belongs, 
soldiers of the unit to which Comrade Kim Chan-yong belongs, and 
soldiers and employees of a Korea People's Security Forces unit 
to which Comrade Kim Chi-tok belongs, for being good examples 
for army-people relations. 
  Soldiers of the unit to which Comrade Han Chae-sun belongs 
have actively supported working people who accelerated socialist 
construction. Recently, they helped construct a bridge and a 
county cultural hall, road expansion works, and transported 
large quantities of cargo including farming materials. 
  Soldiers and workers of the unit to which Comrade Na Ui-pong 
belongs sent tens of thousands of watermelons that were grown 
with great care in green houses, to Pyongyang citizens who were 
celebrating the April festival. 
  On many occassions, soldiers of the unit to which Comrade 
Kim 
Chan-yong belongs, transported hundreds of tonnes of materials 
needed in people's lives to places 100-ri away. 
  Soldiers and employees of the unit to which Comrade Kim 
Chi-tok belongs encouraged the employees of a smeltery station 
in their struggle to increase steel production by sending them 
large quantities of foods they produced with the revolutionary 
spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. 
  Meetings to deliver the messages of thanks from KPA Supreme 
Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il were held in respective units. 
During the meetings, the messages of thanks from the comrade 
supreme commander were delivered amid the participants' 
enthusiastic applause. 
  There were also discussions to show their resolve. The 
meetings adopted letters of pledge to the dear leader of our 
party and the people and the KPA Supreme Commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Calls For Arming With Revolutionary </F>
Traditions of Workers' Party of Korea" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- An editorial of NODONG 
SINMUN today calls for firmly arming the people with the party's 
revolutionary traditions. 
  Noting that arming with and inheriting the revolutionary 
traditions is an important work related to the prospect of the 
party and the socialist cause, the editorial urges deepening the 
work in response to the demand of the developing reality. 
  The editorial goes on: 
  Firmly arming with the revolutionary traditions of the party 
is an important requirement in consolidating the singlehearted 
unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks from generation 
to generation and achieving a new revolutionary upsurge in 
socialist construction. 
  The revolutionary traditions of the party is a valuable 
revolutionary wealth gained in the course of the growth of the 
ranks of singlehearted unity and their strengthening. In order 
to further strengthen the singlehearted unity of the whole 
party, all the people and the entire Army around the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong- il, the traditions of the unity and cohesion 
of kinship between the leader and the soldiers and the leader 
and the people must be fully inherited. 
  Arming with the party's revolutionary traditions is an 
important demand in frustrating the malicious anti-socialist 
moves of the imperialists and defending the precious gains of 
our revolution to the end. 
  The revolutionary traditions of our party were established 
in 
the course of an arduous struggle without precedent against the 
atrocious imperialist aggressors armed to the teeth. 
  The traditions run through with the indomitable fighting 
spirit, revolutionary optimism, staunch spirit of 
anti-imperialist struggle and noble spirit of patriotism are 
valuable ideological and moral wealth of the Korean people in 
driving back the counter- revolutionary offensive of the enemies 
and upholding the banner of socialism. 
  The editorial stresses the need to develop in depth the work 
for arming the people with the revolutionary traditions.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) - Coal output is on a 
steady increase in Korea. 
  According to data available, the coal mines of the country 
have increased daily tunnelling 1.2 times and Koal output 1.3 
times as against the corresponding period last year. 
  The Anju and Sunchon area coal complexes, which hold big 
shares of the nation's coal production, have topped their daily 
assignments by 20-30 percent in capital and preparatory 
tunnelling and slope pit tunnelling and 20 percent in coal 
output in the latest week. 
  The South Hamgyong provincial area coal complex has 
introduced a new method of blasting to create new norms and 
records one after another in tunnelling. 
  The Kowon coal mine has increased the amount of tunnelling 
30 
percent above the same period last year, while increasing the 
capacity of reserve cutting faces 1.4 times with the same 
equipment, materials and workforce. 
  Coal mines in Kaechon, Tokchon, Pukchang, Onsong, Saeppyol 
and Myongchon areas are now overfulfilling their daily 
assignments through a mass technical innovation movement.

  [Text] With regard to the civilian industrial technology 
cooperation that was discussed as a backbone for "global 
bilateral cooperation" between Japan and the United States 
during the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the Japanese 
Government disclosed on 9 May that both Japan and the United 
States have agreed to launch joint research in four areas 
including the joint development of ceramics, which is used to 
manufacture the semiconductor substrate of the next-generation 
high-density integrated circuit. Mary Good [name as published], 
U.S. secretary of commerce for technology, will visit Japan in 
early June together with American researchers in charge of the 
four areas to consult with Hiroshi Kashiwahi, Agency of 
Industrial Science and Technology director general, and other 
Japanese researchers about specific ways to cooperate. 
  Japan and the United States originally agreed to promote 
civilian industrial technology cooperation in 10 areas during 
vice ministerial talks held last December, but the two countries 
later agreed to initiate cooperation within four areas. The 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks remain stalled, but there 
has been no disagreement between the two countries on promoting 
cooperation and pressing ahead in the four areas. 
  The United States, which plans to convert the military and 
aerospace technologies into civilian production, wants to use 
Japan's advanced industrial technology. While the United States 
is increasingly moving to protect its high-tech industry, Japan 
aims to head off future trade friction with the United States by 
promoting cooperation in which Japanese private enterprises will 
participate. 
  The four areas include the joint research and development of 
ceramics, composite carbon fiber materials used to manufacture 
machinery, data collection using a crystal protein system, and 
technology to build more environmentally friendly factories. 
  The semiconductor substrate, which is obtained from the 
burned powder of nitriding aluminum, has been used mainly for 
military purposes in the United States. Under the joint 
research and development arrangement, an attempt will be made to 
combine the U.S. manufacturing technology with Japan's 
processing technology to raise the thermal conductivity of 
semiconductor substrate by about two times for the ultimate 
purpose of keeping heat from staying in semiconductors. This 
attempt, if successful, would serve to miniaturize the cooling 
device of large computers, liquid-crystal television sets, and 
personal computers, while prolonging their durability. 
  Under the joint development arrangement, an attempt will 
also 
be made to combine U.S. stereo fabric technology, which has been 
used by NASA to build space shuttles, with Japan's surface 
processing technology, which uses high-powered lasers to develop 
composite carbon fiber materials. Japanese and American 
researchers will work to develop a technology that costs less in 
manufacturing composite carbon fiber materials. Composite 
carbon fiber materials will be widely used to manufacture 
high-powered engines and high-precision machine tools.

<F P=106> [Letter from Thanat Khoman, former foreign minister, in the </F>
"Post Bag" Column] 
  [Text] SIR: Once again, the World Accuser swells his 
throat to shout accusations against Thailand when the US State 
Department alleged that cadres (narcotics) have allies in 
government offices, banks and law enforcement agencies which, 
according to that source, allowed illicit drug trade to flourish 
in Thailand. This statement reflects the accusers' own rich 
experience and practices. How? 1. The United States, or at 
least the CIA, under George Bush, used General Noriega, now 
imprisoned in Florida, as its salaried agent, to get involved in 
drug operations in Latin, and particularly South and Central 
America. When that agent became indocile, Bush sent armed 
forces to capture him and, in the process, committed a dastardly 
massacre of innumerable innocent Panamanian people. 
  2. As to drug money laundering, American officials and 
others 
know something about it. A certain Clark Clifford, who was once 
US Secretary of Defence and later became president of an 
important bank in New York, was arraigned before a law court 
there accused of involvement in drug money laundering through 
his bank collaborating with the famous BCCI. He was subjudice 
until the time when the Democrats, having won the elections, 
pulled him out of that predicament for ill-health reason. That 
was the way how justice operates in that wonderful land of super 
race and super virtuous men. 
  3. To me and, I am sure, to many Thais, the acceptance of 
the 
miserable US$2 million, for cooperation in drug matter, 
undeniably hurts our national pride. That loathsome money 
should be returned to the donors with our thanks, as they may 
need it for use elsewhere. And, the sooner the better. We will 
help raise funds to replace that insulting money, which has made 
it possible for that foreign government to send DEA [Drug 
Enfocement Agency] agents here. One of them, not long ago, 
killed a suspect without due verification. The affair was hushed 
up, and the culprit was shipped out with collusion from our 
authorities. 
  4. I hope that, after the recent accusation, the Thai side 
will review the matter and take appropriate step in the right 
direction. We should be wise enough to realise that this is a 
way to "pass the buck" and the blame upon us, to be used as the 
scapegoats, while the principal party -- namely the United 
States and a number of Western nations -- are fuelling it by 
insatiable demands as their local consumption continually 
increases, causing greater difficulties for us to curb and 
suppress production. The United States and its Western cronies 
are, in fact, directly responsible. 
  5. The question which comes to the mind of many people is 
how a government, which cannot maintain law and order in its own 
country where crime rate in its own capital city rises by some 
50 per cent to the point that its mayoress had to ask for the 
intervention of the National Guard, has the indecency to preach 
lessons and make accusations against others? It would certainly 
earn more respect and credibility by observing the elementary 
honesty and recognise its own defects and concentrate on setting 
its own house in order.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
concluded a secret agreement in 1969 under which the U.S. can 
redeploy and transport nuclear weapons in Okinawa Prefecture in 
case of emergency, according to a book to be published Thursday 
[12 May]. Kei Wakaizumi, a former professor of international 
politics at Kyoto Industrial University, said in his new book 
that the two countries concluded the secret deal during summit 
talks between then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President 
Richard Nixon in November 1969. 
  According to the book, a draft of agreed minutes to the 
Japan-U.S. Joint Communique Nov. 21, 1969, stated in part, "In 
times of great emergency the United States Government will 
require the reentry of nuclear weapons and transit rights in 
Okinawa with prior consultation with the Government of Japan." 
  The agreed minutes also said, "The Government of Japan, 
appreciating the United States Government's requirements in 
times of great emergency as stated above by the President, will 
meet these requirements without delay when such prior 
consultation takes place." 
  As Sato's special envoy, Wakaizumi at the time was 
negotiating the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese control with 
Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security adviser. The U.S. 
had maintained a presence of nuclear weapons in Okinawa before 
the territory was returned to Japan by the Nixon administration 
in 1972. 
  Prime Minister Sato had insisted then that Japan would 
reject 
the reentry of nuclear weapons into Okinawa even if there were 
prior consultations. 
  A government source, when asked to comment on the secret 
accord mentioned in Wakaizumi's book, said he is not aware of 
"such facts." 
  "No comment. We ignore (the report)," the source said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japan plans to provide South 
Africa with its first yen loan as early as this summer to help 
promote economic development under President Nelson Mandela, 
government sources said Tuesday [10 May]. The loan will fall in 
a range of billions of yen and its disbursement is expected 
after an international aid panel designates South Africa as an 
eligible recipient this summer, they said. 
  The loan will be used for projects to be picked up at the 
request of South Africa and will include construction of roads, 
ports and power plants, the sources said. 
  Tokyo intends to include South Africa among nations eligible 
for aid because it is moving toward democracy, they said. 
  Japan will also expand its grant-in-aid program, focusing on 
education facilities, technical assistance, medical support and 
agricultural development, they said. 
  In tandem with other industrial nations, Japan to date has 
not extended full-scale economic assistance in protest of the 
country's apartheid policy. But some 100 million yen has been 
given as grant-in-aid to support blacks since the Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development's development 
assistance committee allowed the assistance in 1990. 
  Japan and six other Group of Seven industrial nations agreed 
earlier this month to coordinate their backing to South Africa 
under its new government following the African National 
Congress's victory in the first all-race elections.

  [Text] This morning, 10 May, at the National Assembly 
office, Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly of 
the Kingdom of Cambodia, and a number of MP's granted an 
audience to His Excellency [H.E.] Yuriy Mirkotnykh, Russian 
ambassador to Cambodia, who came to pay a courtesy call and bid 
farewell to them. 
  On that occasion, the Russian ambassador thanked Samdech 
Chea 
Sim for allowing him to come and bid farewell before returning 
to his country on 8 May 1994, after the completion of his 
mission in Cambodia. The ambassador expressed his regret and 
nostalgia over his departure from Cambodia, where he had been 
working for 24 years in close bilateral cooperation to reinforce 
and expand the relations in all fields, especially in the 
process of seeking peace, national reconciliation, and national 
compromise to put an end to the Cambodian war. This process 
remains unsuccessful due to the Party of Democratic Kampuchea's 
intransigence and refusal to join the Royal Government of 
Cambodia [RGC]. Anyway, the Russian envoy emphasized that even 
though he was to undertake his task in another place, he would 
continue his endeavor to seek peace for Cambodia. 
  In his reply, Samdech Chea Sim thanked Russia for its 
assistance to Cambodia and for the success resulting from its 
good bilateral cooperation with the country. He expressed hope 
that Russia would further its diplomatic cooperation with 
Cambodia after the departure of H.E. Yuriy Mirkotnykh. 
  Again the Russian ambassador said Russia would make 
arrangements for welcoming Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, 
deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia, who will soon visit Russia to sign a number 
of agreements on international cooperation between the two 
countries. He added that Russia would always support the RGC 
and National Assembly. 
  Samdech Chea Sim thanked Russia for its support for the 
National Assembly and RGC, saying he hoped that in the 
cooperation between the two countries' assemblies there would be 
exchanges of visits by various assembly committees to strengthen 
and promote the process of rehabilitating and rebuilding the 
countries toward prosperity. 
  On that occasion, the Russian ambassador asked Samdech Chea 
Sim about the roundtable meeting between the RGC and the Party 
of Democratic Kampuchea. Commenting on this issue Samdech Chea 
Sim said the RGC has exerted its all-out efforts in this 
problem, but the Khmer Rouge side refuses to meet in Phnom Penh 
under the pretext that the city is not neutral and that there is 
no security for its delegation, although the RGC has already 
made all kinds of guarantees. The samdech also pointed out that 
the roundtable meeting had not been held yet and that it can 
take place only if a cease-fire is implemented beforehand. 
  On the issue of reorganizing elections proposed by His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk -- who has said that if the Khmer 
Rouge are real patriots, he will propose new general elections 
to be organized by Cambodian parties without the participation 
of the United Nations -- Samdech Chea Sim said the Khmer Rouge 
side has not yet given its answer to this proposal and that the 
Cambodian National Assembly is currently considering it and 
awaiting a decision from the RGC. The samdech stressed that if 
polls are to be reorganized, the Constitution should be changed, 
and the RGC and National Assembly should be dissolved. This 
move, he added, appears to be beneficial to the Khmer Rouge. 
  The Russian ambassador also wanted to know about the RGC's 
decision to outlaw the Khmer Rouge. On this issue, Samdech Chea 
Sim said this move has been put aside and that the RGC and 
National Assembly have not discussed it yet. He further said 
that next week, the National Assembly will continue its session 
to discuss the appointment of new MP's to replace the old ones 
and debate diverse laws as planned in the agenda.

  [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul government 
sought more information on the discovery of 70 kg of plutonium 
that is not registered with the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) at a Japanese nuclear fuel plant, and is prepared 
for "necessary measures" once details are revealed, a Foreign 
Ministry official said Wednesday. 
  The ministry instructed the embassy in Tokyo to find out 
more 
about the discovery, especially how such a large quantity of 
plutonium escaped past IAEA inspections, the official said on 
condition of anonymity. 
  The plutonium is enough to produce nine nuclear bombs, the 
official pointed out. 
  He said he believes the plutonium was left in plant 
facilities during the reprocessing cycle.

<F P=106> ["Confrontational Agitation Reversing Black and White" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
"unification minister" at the "coordinating meeting on the 
reunification and security policy" driveled that "sanctions on 
the North are inevitable" and "the international cooperation 
system" must be intensified "to increase the pressure," alleging 
that the North "is delaying" a solution to the "nuclear issue" 
by refusing to accept the demand of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  Denouncing this as an outrageous and disgusting hokum, an 
analyst of MINJU CHOSON today says: 
  As regards the replacement of the fuel rod at our atomic 
power station, we voluntarily informed the IAEA of this plan and 
allowed the inspectors of the agency to observe the process of 
the replacement and verify that the nuclear materials are not 
diverted to a non-peaceful purpose. 
  This notwithstanding, the South Korean puppets are again 
crying for "sanctions" and "international cooperation system" 
with preposterous arguments. This is an unpardonable 
treacherous act motivated by the sinister intention to block a 
peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula 
and harm and stifle fellow countrymen over the "nuclear issue". 
  When they linked the North's proposal of negotiations for 
establishing a new peace arrangement in place of the present 
armistice body with the "nuclear issue", they sought to obstruct 
the negotiations between the DPRK and the United States for the 
guarantee of peace. 
  The reckless remarks of the "unification minister" clearly 
show once again how frantically the South Korean puppets are 
trying to harm and stifle the North over the "nuclear issue". 
  Those who commit treacheries must be removed from the 
nation.

<F P=106> ["`Internationalization' To Sell Nation's Soul and </F>
Interests" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
brands the "internationalization" hastened by the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam as a treacherous act to sell the nation's interests to 
outside forces and further reduce South Korea to their colony 
and theater of rampage. 
  The paper in a by-lined article says: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam hurriedly announced a "strategy of 
internationalization" in November last year as soon as he opened 
the rice market. It was a crafty ruse to lull the people's 
protest and criticism against his treacherous rice market 
opening. 
  He intends to curry favour with his U.S. master through his 
full compliance with the master's demand and prolong his power 
with the backing of the master in disregard of the dignity of 
the nation and the interests of the people. The 
"internationalization" is a product of his despicable flunkeyist 
and treacherous scheme to justify the U.S. domination and 
plunder and prolong his remaining days under the patronage of 
outside forces. 
  The "internationalization" is aimed at bartering away the 
nation's soul and interests to outside forces and reducing South 
Korea to an "international prostitute." 
  Under the veil of "internationalization," the traitor Kim 
Yong- sam has removed or eased the nominal restrictions on the 
infiltration of foreign capital into South Korea, leaving South 
Korea to the tender mercy of foreign monopolies and adapting 
everything in South Korea to foreign fashion. 
  The "internationalization" scheme of the traitor is a 
treacherous act to induce bigger outside forces into South 
Korea, fatten comprador capital, extort the workers, farmers and 
other working people and reduce them to slaves to outside forces.

<F P=106> ["Loyal Party Cell Movement"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
describes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's historic work 
"Let Us Strengthen Party Cells" as a highly important guideline 
in strengthening the party cells as required by the revolution 
in its new, higher stage of development, immensely increasing 
the fighting efficiency of the Workers' Party of Korea and 
effecting a revolutionary upswing in socialist construction. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as saying: 
  "After the training course held at the proposal of the 
Central Committee of the party for the party cell secretaries 
from all parts of the country in 1991, a vigorous movement was 
launched to create loyal party cells throughout the whole party 
under the slogan, `Let us make all the party cells loyal cells 
', and their militant function and role have been enhanced as 
never before." 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il's work "Let us strengthen party cells" 
fully encompasses the principles in making all party cells 
remain unfailingly loyal to the party and the leader, ranging 
from proper party life, guidance and work with the masses to the 
enhancement of the role of party cell secretaries. 
  The paper says in a by-lined article: 
  The loyal party cell movement has been waged vigorously 
throughout the party over the last three years. As a result, a 
new change has taken place in the ideological and moral traits 
of our party members, the singlehearted unity of the leader, the 
party and the masses further consolidated and a constant 
innovation and upswing effected in socialist construction. 
  Our party members think they can neither live nor make 
revolution apart from the embrace of the dear leader, and they 
are all determined to become vanguard fighters and rifles and 
bombs to defend the party and the leader with their lives. 
  Amid the vigorous loyal party cell movement over the last 
three years, tens of thousands of party cell members wrote 
letters pledging loyalty to the dear leader, and he replied to 
the members of a many party cells. 
  In the course of making loyal party cells, our party 
members' 
revolutionary spirit of absolutizing and unconditionally 
implementing the party policies has risen beyond comparison. 
  Today the entire party members and other working people are 
constantly working new miracles and performing feats in all 
sectors of socialist construction, with the firm belief that 
their leader, their party, their chuche idea and their socialism 
are the best.

  [Text] The Timorese resistance has accused the United 
Nations of having double standards. In a letter to the UN 
secretary general the East Timor resistance says that the United 
Nations has double standards when it comes to defending 
universal principles. The letter, dated 31 March, and signed by 
Konis Santana, leader of the armed front, was given to 
Butrus-Ghali last Friday, the day the Portuguese and Indonesian 
foreign ministers met in Geneva. In the letter, revealed by the 
LUSA news agency today, the resistance leaders speak of cases 
where acts of aggression had failed, such as the Soviet invasion 
of Afghanistan, Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and Iraq's 
invasion of Kuwait, in order to stress that the Indonesian 
occupation of East Timor has only given rise to UN resolutions 
which have not substantially altered the situation. According to 
Konis Santana, this situation continues because of the 
political, economic and commercial geostrategic interests of 
powerful nations, which lead the United Nations to use double 
standards when dealing with acts of aggression.

  [Text] New Delhi (BISNIS)--President Suharto is prepared to 
extend his term of office as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM] for six months to a year when his term ends in 1995 if NAM 
member countries have not been successful in finding a successor. 
  The willingness of Pak Harto [President Suharto] to extend 
the term as NAM chairman applies only if NAM countries face 
difficulties in finding a new leader, Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas said, as reported from New Delhi yesterday by BISNIS 
correspondent Tarman Azzam. 
  Accompanied by Minister of State and State Secretary 
Murdiono, Ali Alatas reported the results of a meeting between 
President Suharto and Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in New 
Delhi Monday night [28 March]. 
  In his meeting with Rao, President Suharto explained 
Indonesia's view, namely that NAM chairmanship succession should 
be conducted in an orderly way so that more members will hold 
the position for leading the developing nations. 
  The Indian prime minister was told of the NAM chairman's 
views on the importance of the World Population Conference in 
Cairo, Egypt, from 1 to 4 June, when it is hoped that a decision 
will be made on NAM leadership. 
  The meeting in Cairo will be preceded by a meeting of NAM 
foreign ministers on 30-31 May, Ali Alatas said. 
  Murdiono said that Indonesia's term of office as NAM 
chairman 
will end in 1995. Indonesia's willingness to extend the term is 
only to permit the next candidate for the NAM chairmanship to 
prepare itself in the best possible way. 
  The subject of extending Indonesia's term of office as NAM 
chairman surfaced because several member countries asked 
Indonesia to hold the office for another term. 
  According to Murdiono, Indonesia's basic position is that it 
is not good for a person to be NAM chairman for two successive 
terms. In this case, Pak Harto wants the NAM fully to uphold the 
basic principles of the NAM organization.

  [Text] Suharto, chairman of GOLKAR's [Functional Groups 
Organization] Development Board, has asked for an increase in 
coordination, integration and communication among the three 
tracks, A, B and C, within the Greater GOLKAR Community. 
Coordination among these three tracks must be carried out 
periodically, or if possible constantly, using the principles of 
mutual respect and openness by creating close relationships 
among the tracks so that joint social and GOLKAR problems can be 
solved quickly. 
  Suharto, chairman of GOLKAR's Development Board and 
president 
of the Republic of Indonesia, expressed these thoughts in his 
written recommendations delivered by Azwar Anas, the coordinator 
of GOLKAR's Development Board's Duty Presidium, at the opening 
of the 1994 National Working Meeting (RAKERNAS) of GOLKAR's DPP 
[Executive Board], which took place in the auditorium of the DPP 
offices in Slipi, Jakarta, yesterday morning. The top leader of 
track A, General of the Army Feisal Tandjung, and of track B, 
Minister of the Interior Mohammad Yogie S. Memet, also attended 
the opening ceremonies. 
  Besides stressing the importance of unity among the three 
tracks, the Chairman of the Development Board also advised all 
of GOLKAR's cadres on the proper attitude to take towards 
various political issues which are now critical to our society. 
One of them is the issue of the undercurrent. 
<H5>  The Undercurrent </H5>
  Mr Suharto said that the issue of the undercurrent, which 
has 
continued to develop recently and which has become a tough 
problem for the Greater GOLKAR Community, must be overcome 
immediately because it will eventually damage GOLKAR. The 
Development Board believes that basically no undercurrent is 
developing. "A small number of people have misused the name of 
the many and have called themselves the undercurrent," he said. 
What is actually happening is a kind of manipulation because in 
fact those politics are no different from various kinds of 
manipulation. 
  Speaking about the issues of collusion and other 
defalcations 
which have surfaced recently, the chairman of the Development 
Board asked GOLKAR to be capable of anticipating and overcoming 
them in accordance with the constitution and the laws based on 
PANCASILA [Five Principles of the Nation]. At the same time, 
GOLKAR must continue to push for the creation of a professional, 
honest, clear and authoritative government apparatus as the 
servant of the state and of the people, ready to protect, serve 
as a model for, serve and value the rights and obligations of 
every citizen without exception. This apparatus must avoid 
provocative actions which have no basis in facts or figures but 
must be based on the rule of law. 
  Speaking of the problem of succession, which the mass media 
has discussed a lot recently, Mr Soeharto reminded the audience 
that we should always be guided by the constitution which was 
approved by the people through the MPR [People's Consultative 
Council]. The Development Board believes that a lot of fuss 
should not be made over this issue because there already is a 
mechanism for succession, i.e., the five-year leadership 
mechanism. "Through this forum GOLKAR's cadres should be able to 
explain this to the broader public in the provinces," he 
affirmed. 
  The Chairman of the Development Board also reminded the 
audience that the excellent record already achieved at each 
general election must be maintained and this can at the same 
time be a counter to the issue of the single majority developed 
by the other side. The issue of the majority and the possibility 
that a dictatorship of the majority will arise are false. 
"Because after five victories we have not become dictators; in 
fact, we have always valued the opinions of the masses and have 
accommodated their aspirations," he said. 
<H5>  General Election Laws </H5>
  Another matter about which we must be cautious, said the 
Chairman of the Development Board, is the other side's desire to 
reconsider and change the present general-election laws. The 
Development Board believes that the existing general-election 
laws are still sufficiently relevant to current conditions and 
therefore should be maintained. 
  GOLKAR's victories in five general elections are proof that 
the people trust GOLKAR so much that they channel their 
aspirations to GOLKAR. The people's trust cannot be ignored. "It 
is the task of GOLKAR's cadres to continue to build up GOLKAR 
support so that in the upcoming 1997 general elections 
supporters will continue to put their support and confidence in 
GOLKAR again," said Mr Suharto. 
  In facing these problems, said Mr Suharto, we must really 
develop GOLKAR cadres, those in the legislative ranks, in the 
administration and in the social and professional/functional 
organizations; organizational discipline must continually be 
increased. "Long before making a decision, the coordination of 
the three tracks must be increased," he warned. Instructions 
about decisions already agreed to in the capital must be given 
to and implanted in the provinces so that the same consensus is 
reached in both the capital and the provinces. 
  As part of the effort to win the upcoming 1997 general 
elections, according to the directives issued by GOLKAR's 
Development Board, the provinces in which there was a decline in 
GOLKAR votes in the 1992 general elections must be evaluated as 
soon as possible. GOLKAR must pay the most attention to the 
cultivation of those provinces. Preparations must be made to 
cultivate public issues in the form of real actions which GOLKAR 
raises and realizes. 
  Mr Suharto said that cultivating supporters person by person 
must be based on principle of no day is to pass without 
cultivating supporters through the following approach: each 
GOLKAR cadre is obliged to develop GOLKAR supporters, at the 
very least those who live "on the same mattress," "in the same 
kitchen" and "use the same well". In addition, efforts must be 
made to cultivate new voters, of whom there will be 21 million 
at the upcoming 1997 general elections. One way to cultivate 
them is for every DPD II [Provincial Parliament] to hold a 
yearly hiking contest for Junior High School and Senior High 
School students and for vocational schools at the same level, 
the prize being a one-year scholarship. Mr Suharto also reminded 
the audience that capable, well-known campaigners capable of 
attracting public support must be gotten ready as soon as 
possible. 
<H5>  GOLKAR Cadres </H5>
  In carrying out provincial duties, the Chairman of GOLKAR's 
Development Board urged that each and every task be carried out 
with an attitude of unity, harmony and permanent communication 
among the members of the Greater GOLKAR Community. Besides that, 
GOLKAR cadres in the ranks of the legislature and in the 
professions and functional groups must also increase their 
sensitivity so as to be able to grasp and realize the 
aspirations developing within society. 
  "Because an inability to grasp and fight for the aspirations 
living and developing within society might harm GOLKAR in the 
future," affirmed Mr Suharto. At the same time, any policy 
considered harmful to society or the actions of any tainted 
figure must be prevented as soon as possible. 
  GOLKAR's caderization, said Mr Suharto, must produce the 
following vision and ideal: GOLKAR is always prepared to respond 
to challenges and is always responsive to the needs of the 
people. Without that condition, caderization is merely 
ceremonial action and only follows the words of the constitution 
but neglects its spirit. In this respect, GOLKAR is being 
tested. Can it regain the trust not only its traditional 
supporters but also of the 21 million new voters in the 1997 
general elections? 
  Speaking of cadre management, the Chairman of GOLKAR's 
Development Board suggested that data on membership and cadres 
be updated immediately and accurately, emphasizing the 
recruitment of quality cadres. Putting the education and 
training of cadres on a firm footing must be implemented in an 
integrated, planned, guided, graduated and uninterrupted way. 
These initiatives include tools for evaluating the achievements 
of cadres and the compilation of criteria for that purpose, as 
well as assigning tasks to cadres in a conceptional way. 
<H5>  A National Viewpoint </H5>
  Mr Suharto reminded the audience that GOLKAR must continue 
to 
strengthen its commitment to PANCASILA, which is to be 
implemented by its being in the forefront of instilling and 
implementing PANCASILA. The purpose of this is to heighten 
vigilance and to make an effort to counter various ways of 
thinking, concepts and ideologies which are in conflict with or 
not in accordance with PANCASILA, and which are being practiced 
by certain parties, in particular the intensive efforts being 
made in various ways by certain parties to inject ways of 
thinking, concepts and ideologies which are not in accordance 
with PANCASILA. 
  For that reason, GOLKAR must also strengthen its commitment 
to instilling a national viewpoint which is reflected in the 
patterns of thought, action, work and works which have a 
national viewpoint. Efforts to strengthen this national 
viewpoint continue to show their relevance because of the two 
contradictory trends which have affected the world in our times. 
First, the trend towards globalization marked by a trend towards 
a uniformity of value systems, patterns of thought, work, and 
production. The second trend is an atavistic attitude and a 
narrow concept of nation. Such a concept is now affecting 
certain regions and nations so that tendencies in that direction 
have succeeded in splitting apart a nation and state and 
eventually that nation and state disappears from the world 
political map. "We have had a lot of experience with that and we 
don't want to undergo that again," he said. 
  Efforts to put that national viewpoint on a firm footing 
show 
the relevance of government programs to eradicate poverty. That 
is why the Development Board invites all parties to foster and 
develop feelings of social solidarity with those who live below 
the poverty line, with those who always suffer catastrophes and 
natural disasters and with the less fortunate. 
  The National Working Meeting which opened yesterday will end 
on 31 March. Except for the opening and closing ceremonies, all 
activities are closed to the mass media. Harmoko, General 
Chairman of GOLKAR's DPP; Army General Feisal Tandjung, Chairman 
of track A of the Greater GOLKAR Community; Minister of the 
Interior Mohammad Yogie S. Memet, Chairman of track B of the 
Greater GOLKAR Community; and Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Minister 
of National Development Planning and Chairman of BAPPENAS 
[National Planning Board] gave briefings at the National Working 
Meeting.

  [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto has ordered on 
Wednesday to find out why the country's exports have dropped and 
that steps have to be taken to correct the situation for the 
sake of the country's foreign exchange income, Information 
Minister Harmoko said. 
  Speaking after a limited cabinet meeting with President 
Suharto, Harmoko also said that the president had asked for a 
close observation on the inflation rate which stood at 0.24 
percent in April and 0.70 percent in March. 
  Accordingly, surplus of the country's trade with partners 
from Hong Kong, Japan, China, United Arab Emirates, and Thailand 
had dropped in January this year. 
  But its trade with the United States, the Netherlands, 
Britain, South Korea, and Benelux had surplus increase. 
  Indonesia had a surplus of U.S. $649.2 million in February 
with exports standing at U.S. $2.7999 billion and imports at 
U.S. $2.1507 billion, Harmoko said. 
  He said the total value of Indonesia's exports from April 
1993 to February 1994 reached up to U.S. $33.3964 billion, while 
its imports were valued at U.S. $26.2405 billion, leaving a 
surplus worth U.S. $7.1459 billion. 
  Harmoko said the money circulated in March totalled to some 
Rp. [rupiah] 38.452 trillion (U.S. $19.226 billion). 
  Inflation went down because of the drop in the index price 
of 
food stuffs which was recorded at 0.71 percent in April or down 
from 1.61 percent in March. 
  The house index price only increased by 0.40 percent while 
garments only 0.29 percent far below from the 1.41 in March. 
  But the supply and demand for strategic commodities is 
balanced, Harmoko said. 
  President Suharto, on the same occasion, had also specially 
asked to give attention to cocoa marketing and quality control, 
knowing that this commodity is being produced mostly by 
smallholders, he added.

  [Text] It is very important to raise farmers' incomes in 
the Second Long-Range Development Plan (PJPT II). The farm 
sector will remain an important factor because it is still the 
main source of income for the Indonesian people. 
  President Suharto stressed this point at a ceremony held in 
the State Palace, Jakarta, when he presented honors to winners 
of the 1993 national intensification contest on Thursday (10 
February). Mrs. Tien Suharto, Vice President Try Sutrisno and 
Mrs. Try Sutrisno, several members of the Sixth Development 
Cabinet and Minister of Agriculture Sjarifudin Baharsjah were 
present at the ceremony. 
  On this occasion the president symbolically gave a savings 
account of five million rupiahs and a hand tractor to the winner 
of the first prize, Super-INSUS [Special Intensification] Unit 
Number 1 of Cilacap County, Central Java; the prizes were 
accepted by Hidayat, the chairman. The same prizes were given to 
A. Wakidi, Chairman of Tani Sumber Makmur Group III and KUD 
[Village Unit Cooperative] III of Sragen County, East Java. 
  As the first-prize winner in the 1993 Mina Padi 
intensification contest, the Mina Rejeki farmers' group and the 
Bangun Tani KUD from Banjarnegara received a savings account of 
5 million rupiahs, a power thresher unit, fishing equipment and 
all administrative necessities. All of these prizes were 
accepted by Head of the Administrative Section NA [expansion 
unknown] from the Mina Rejeki farmers' group. 
  Another saving book with the same amount of money, ship 
chandler's equipment and all administrative necessities were 
also given to Liwondullah Kuswanto, chairman of the Bakung 
farmers' group and to the Mina Suryo KUD of Cilacap, Central 
Java. This group was the first-prize winner in the 1993 
fish-catching contest. 
  Mrs. Tien Suharto symbolically gave a soy-cake slicing 
machine and three dozen plates to Mrs Chr. Suryanti, a female 
farmer from the Sumber Makmur III Farmers' Group of Sragen. The 
same prizes were given to Mrs. Kuryati, a female farmer from the 
Mina Rejeki farmers' group of Banjarnegara accepted [as 
published] and Mrs. Dariyah Manijo, a female farmer from the 
Bakung farmers' group of Cilacap, Central Java.

  The president stressed that efforts to increase farmers' 
incomes is no less important than other initiatives. During PJPT 
II the farm sector will continue to be the primary source of 
income for most Indonesians. 
  At the same time, along with the increase in population and 
the increase in people's income, the demand for farm products is 
also increasing. On the other hand, these developments reduce 
the amount of farm land. "That is why we must be able to 
increase the ability of farmers to raise the scale of their farm 
enterprises through the development of group farm enterprises 
through the application of various aspects of agribusiness and 
agroindustry," the Head of State said. 
  These measures, said the Head of State, must also be matched 
by an increase in the role of the KUD in servicing farm 
production, capital and marketing. It is hoped that these 
efforts will give an increased value to farm enterprises 
oriented toward agribusiness. 
  In addition, to raise social well-being on a broad scale in 
the years to come, the president continued, the farm sector must 
continue to be developed along with the development of the 
populace so that the agricultural sector can continue to play 
its role and will be able to supply the food needs of the entire 
population of Indonesia. 
  The agricultural sector must also be capable of providing an 
incentive for the growth of domestic and export industries, as 
well as take part in producing equitable growth and in 
increasing village dynamics. The president also stressed that 
sustaining self-support in food must at the same time be 
directed toward increasing the quality of nutrients that people 
consume. That is why self-sufficiency is not limited to just 
rice but also covers diversification of food production and 
consumption. Once again the president stressed, "no less 
important is increasing farmers' incomes". 
  He suggested that raising the living standards of farmers, 
the largest sector of society, has been in the center of the 
developmental battlefield from the start. That is also why the 
field of agriculture always gets the most attention. 
  But he admitted that developing agriculture is not an easy 
task which can be carried out quickly. The development of 
agriculture requires perseverance and takes a long time. The 
president said that development efforts have yielded 
satisfactory results, proved by ever-increasing farm production 
which has resulted in self-sufficiency. 
  The president hopes that we can continue these initiatives 
and at the same time try to increase farmers' income so as to 
decrease the number of farmers living below the poverty line. 
  At the same time, Agriculture Minister Sjarifudin Baharsjah 
said that the goal of these activities is to provide the 
farmers' groups and the KUDs with the greater motivation and 
energy needed to persevere, and be diligent and energetic. It is 
hoped that the heads of development-unit agencies and BIMAS 
[Mass Guidance] managers will increase their cooperation in 
developing and servicing the KUDs and the farmers. 
  Moreover, it will encourage the cooperation and partnership 
between farmers who participate in farmers' groups with KUDs and 
development companies [as published]. He also said that these 
measures will also increase farmers' production, income. .

  [Text] Jakarta (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--President Suharto has 
warned that although Indonesia is rich in oil and able to export 
it, there is a possibility that Indonesia may become an oil 
importing country in the future. 
  "The demand for petroleum, which is now the main source of 
energy, will continue to grow as the incomes of the people rise. 
Therefore, although Indonesia is still a petroleum exporting 
country, with the present growth in consumption it will be a 
petroleum importing country in the future." 
  The chief state said this Saturday [5 March] as he 
inaugurated the PERTAMINA [National Oil and Natural Gas 
Company]-Atlantic Richfield Bali North, Incorporated, [ARBNI] 
natural gas production and transport facilities in the 
Pagerungan Islands and the PERTAMINA-Atlantic Richfield 
Indonesia, Incorporated, [ARII] natural gas production and 
transport facilities at Sidoardjo in East Java. 
  Therefore, according to the president, efforts to conserve 
and diversify energy sources must be made consistently and 
continuously. In this connection, the use of natural gas, the 
reserves of which are quite large, is very important. 
  The chief of state said that the use of natural gas as a raw 
material in making fertilizer has stimulated development in the 
agriculture sector. Through the success of agricultural 
development, millions of farmers have increased their earnings, 
and the growth of domestic industry has been stimulated. 
  "Natural gas has now become an important export commodity. 
No 
small amount of foreign exchange has been earned from natural 
gas exports," the chief of state said. 
  Indonesian natural gas enters a new era with the 
inauguration 
of these two projects in the natural gas sector. The Indonesian 
people will use natural gas on a large scale for domestic needs. 
  Natural gas flowing through the PERTAMINA-ARII production 
and 
transport facilities off the northwest coast of Java will be 
used to fuel the steam-electric power plants at Muara Karang and 
Tanjung Priok. 
  With the construction of Pagerungan PERTAMINA-ARBNI natural 
gas production and transport facilities, all the fuel 
requirements of the gas-fueled steam power plant at Gresik will 
be met. Gas from that project will also be used by the State Gas 
Company to meet the needs of homes and small industry in and 
around Surabaya and as a raw material for the petrochemical 
industry. 
  Indonesia is now experiencing a great increase in electric 
power demand because of the progress of industrial development. 
If that demand for power cannot be met, the industrialization 
process will be hindered. 
  The chief of state said that because of the importance of 
natural gas to future development, the government will keep 
encouraging exploration activity. Although natural gas reserves 
are now quite large, the search for new reserves needs to 
continue into order to meet long-term demand. 
  "There is a good possibility of this, because geologically 
Indonesia possesses very great natural gas resources. I am 
confident that, with the support of advances in science and 
technology, there is still a great possibility of finding new 
oil and gas in Indonesia," the chief of state said. 
  It is hoped that the success achieved by ARII and ARBNI 
under 
production-sharing contracts will create optimism among other 
contractors working in Indonesia that there is a big chance of 
finding new oil and gas in the country. 
  The chief of state said that in the development of oil and 
natural gas efforts, the government has listened to complaints 
about oil and natural gas exploration in Indonesia. A positive 
dialogue needs to be developed between PERTAMINA and its 
partners with regard to the various methods that can enhance 
their mutual benefit. 
  In this connection, on 31 December 1993 the Indonesian 
Government issued a new incentive package that is more conducive 
to exploration and production activity. 
<H5>  Background </H5>
  At the beginning of 1992, PERTAMINA and ARCO Indonesia 
contracted with PLN [State Electricity Public Corporation] to 
supply 260 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for 11 
years beginning in 1994. 
  The natural gas will be used as fuel for the gas-fueled 
steam 
power plants at Muara Karang and Tanjung Priok, which are 
long-term projects scheduled for phased implementation. The 
first phase, implemented on 1 September 1993, was conducted as a 
"fast track" by the direct appointment of an implementing 
contractor. 
  The second, third, and fourth phases are to supply 50 
million 
cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Bima and Northwest 
Corner Fields and develop existing natural gas reserves as an 
effort to maintain natural gas supplies until 2004. Initial 
capital for phase one until production will be more than $300 
million. For development through phase six, the total cost is 
estimated to be $824 million. This investment will be used to 
expand 5 platforms to 29 platforms, 135 kilometers of pipeline 
to 423 kilometers, and 11 production wells to 89. 
<H5>  Benefits </H5>
  Many benefits of the presence of ARCO at Pagerungan were 
reported to President Suharto, but the president did not accept 
the reports at face value. In a dialogue with members of the 
Pagerungan community who gathered at Permisan Village, Jabon, 
Sidoarjo, the president asked them directly about the benefits 
of the presence of ARCO in its involvement with natural gas. 
  Haji Djaelani, leader of the "Abu Hurairah" Islamic Boarding 
School at Pagerungan frankly answered the president by saying 
that the presence of the project is very beneficial to residents 
of Pagerungan. "Damaged, unusable school buildings, both secular 
and Islamic, have now taken on a new look," he said. Similarly, 
a fisherman from Wadjo, who had long lived there, expressed his 
many thanks for the project. 
  Also, a teacher from there has experienced the facilities: 
ARCO has built a new school, and he obtained a new house near 
the school. A cooperative managed by teachers has been 
developed, too. A Pagerungan PKK [Family Welfare Development] 
manager asked for communications facilities to facilitate his 
work of visiting isolated groups on some of the islands. "I 
request communications facilities to facilitate my work," he 
said expectantly. 
  The president later asked ARCO to take part in considering 
the request. A young man then followed by speaking of the 
potential of existing neighborhood youth associations. The 
president asked the young man to take part in finding 
alternatives for fishermen who cannot go to sea in the 
off-season so that their energies can be put to use. He said 
that Pagerungan fishermen cannot work during the westerly 
monsoon. "Find a good alternative--using other skills, 
naturally--so that fisherman can continue to work during the 
westerly monsoon." The regent of Sumenep also accompanied 
members of the community in the dialogue with the president.

  [Text] The head of the APBN [State Budget] Commission of 
the DPR [Parliament] believes that problem loans and 
nonperforming loans made after the KLBI [Bank of Indonesian 
Liquidity Credit] was halted in January 1990 were caused by 
debtors manipulating their equity by marking up the projects 
funded with that credit and by using part of the KLBI funds for 
other projects. 
  Aberson M. Sihaloho, Deputy Chairman of the DPR's APBN 
Commission, said that as soon as the KLBI was halted at the 
beginning of 1990 through the issuance of the 29 January 1990 
policy package known as the January Package, the number of 
problem loans rose sharply. 
  He then mentioned that the percentage of problem loans in 
government banks, about 6 percent in 1990, rose to 11.8 percent 
in 1991, rose again to about 15.8 percent in 1992, and in 1993 
it rose to 21.2 percent of the total credit of 91.8 trillion 
rupiahs granted by BUMN [State-Owned Enterprise] banks. 
  "The Minister of Finance himself presented these figures at 
a 
working meeting with the APBN Commission," said the 
Representative in the DPR building yesterday. 
  Aberson said that the problem loans occurred because debtors 
who obtained low-interest KLBI loans at around 14 percent 
interest increased their equity by marking up the value of their 
projects or their capital goods. "So that equity reached 25 
percent, as was required at that time, but in reality it wasn't 
that high," he said. 
  At the same time, Aberson added, debtors who obtained KLBI 
loans used part of the credit for other projects which had no 
connection with the projects funded by the KLBI, for example for 
investment in hotels or other enterprises; some was even 
deposited in banks. 
  So that, Aberson continued, when the due date arrived and 
the 
debtor had to pay the instalment payment and the interest, the 
project funded by the KLBI was unable to pay the obligation 
because the real value of the project was less than what was 
submitted in the credit proposal. "Debtors who obtained a KLBI 
manipulated the equity from the proceeds of their project 
mark-up, said Aberson, a member of the FPDI [Indonesian 
Democracy Party Faction] of the DPR. 
  As Aberson said, Sumarlin's statement made when he was still 
Minister of Finance in 1990 when he explained the 1990 January 
Package alluded to the fact that the debtors had diverted the 
KLBI funds. 
  Sumarlin said that the KLBI had weaknesses and problems. 
"Many KLBI loans which carry low interest rates and which 
frequently cause distortions in allocation and evaluation are 
still used in our present system of national credit," Sumarlin 
said at that time. 
  Sumarlin said that what happened was that low-interest cash 
loans were then deposited in banks. 
  "As a result of actions such as that, loans obtained by 
debtors before the beginning of 1990, including KLBI loans 
obtained by Eddy Tansil of the Golden Key Group, became problem 
loans, which are not very different from nonperforming loans," 
said Aberson. 
  Nonperforming loans not yet turned over to the State Auction 
and Loan Affairs Board [BUPLN], Aberson said, are still 
considered problem loans by the bank concerned. "It is not until 
it is turned over to the BUPLN that it becomes a nonperforming 
loan," said Aberson.

    [Editorial Report] The 11 April Jakarta BISNIS INDONESIA in 
Indonesian on page 5 reported that the recently established East 
Asian Growth Area [EAGA] encompassing the eastern region of 
Indonesia, the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, Brunei, 
and the Mindanao islands of the Philippines--is expected to 
increase Indonesia's exports from its eastern region. Marketing 
agricultural commodities from North Sulawesi to Mindanao will be 
easier, according to Minister for Trade and Industry Hartarto, 
and transportation cost for exports to Japan and South Korea 
will be reduced because of the accessiblity of the northern sea 
lanes instead of going through the traditional route of the 
Strait of Malacca or Singapore. Minister Hartarto stated that 
EAGA may eventually even serve as a gateway for trade in Asia 
and the Pacific region. Hartarto added that the government will 
establish incentives to encourage businessmen to develop the 
area, and local governments will be given full authority to work 
with the private sector.

  [Text] Over the last three years the number of Indonesians 
living below the poverty line declined by about 1.8 million 
people (1.39 percent). In 1990 27.7 million Indonesians (15.08 
percent) were living below the poverty line; according to a 1993 
National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), this figure has dropped 
to 25.9 million people (13.67 percent). 
  Minister of State for National Development Planning/Chairman 
of BAPPENAS [National Planning Board] Ginandjar Kartasasmita, 
Minister of State/State Secretary Moerdiono, Deputy Chairman of 
BAPPENAS Rahardi Ramelan and Deputy Chairman of the Central 
Bureau of Statistics (BPS) Sugito reported the results of the 
1993 SUSENAS to President Suharto at the president's office in 
Jakarta yesterday. The report also included preparations for 
submitting the DIP [Approved Projects List], including REPELITA 
VI [Sixth Five-Year Development Plan]. 
  Ginandjar told the press that the decrease in the number of 
people living below the poverty line or below the sufficiency 
limit shows that development has resulted in fewer poor people, 
in both absolute and relative terms. 
  The 1993 SUSENAS used new methods which are more accurate 
and 
broader and which had a lot of input from international 
institutions, including the World Bank. "The World Bank used to 
criticize the way we made our calculations," he said. "Now there 
is a higher percentage of poor people in the villages than in 
urban areas, whereas previously it was the opposite," Ginandjar 
continued. 
  He also stressed that under the new way of calculating, 
which 
takes into consideration the pace of inflation and the price 
index, the number of poor people, in the villages as well as in 
the cities, has decreased in both absolute and relative terms. 
"So as we come to the end of the PJP I [First Long-Range 
Development] the number of poor people has declined from the 70 
million at the start of the New Order (about 60 percent) to 25.9 
million (13.67 percent). This is a very satisfying figure," he 
said. 
<H5>  Improved Method </H5>
  Deputy Chairman of the BPS Sugito said that the method used 
in 1993 for calculating the number and percentage of poor people 
was an improvement over the method used in 1990. 
  He explained that the method had to be improved because 
given 
the developments that have taken place since REPELITA I there 
are some commodities which the masses, even those of the lowest 
class, had not consumed at that time but were being consumed a 
lot now. Sugito said that formerly only 14 commodities were 
consumed in urban areas and 12 in rural areas. Starting with 
1993 and into the future 46 commodities will be used in the 
nonfood commodities package. A distinction will be made between 
rural and urban areas. The commodities will be the same, but the 
patterns of consumption will differ. 
  For example, it turns out that expenditures for those 46 
commodities are different for people in the lowest class in 
rural and urban areas even though the commodities are the same. 
The volume of consumption differs. For example, more meat is 
consumed in the cities than in the villages. 
  Rice consumption is relatively higher in the cities since it 
turns out that in the villages people consume corn, dried 
cassava, yams, etc. as well as rice. 
  He said the number and percentage of poor people was 
calculated by setting a sufficiency or poverty limit. The 
figures used are SUSENAS's expenditure figures. The poverty 
limit is calculated by adding the food sufficiency limit to the 
nonfood sufficiency limit. 
  The food sufficiency limit used under the old method was 
based on the minimum requirements for food in order to lead a 
healthy life, i.e., the equivalent of 2,100 calories per capita 
per day. The value of the food sufficiency limit was obtained by 
calculating the rupiah value of 2,100 calories, without taking 
into consideration the type of food commodities consumed. 
  Under the new method, the food sufficiency limit is 
calculated by first determining the commodities package which 
should be consumed by a person so that he can live a healthy 
life, a caloric content of 2,100 calories. The BPS considers 52 
food commodities representative of the consumption patterns of 
lower-class people. The rupiah value of these 52 commodities is 
defined as the food sufficiency limit. 
  Under the old method the nonfood sufficiency limit was 
calculated by defining a number of nonfood commodities as the 
commodities which should be consumed. A distinction was made in 
the number of commodities in rural and urban figures, 14 for 
urban areas and 12 for rural areas. This commodities package, 
said the deputy chairman of the Central Bureau of Statistics, 
was felt to be increasingly unrepresentative of the consumption 
patterns of our developing nation. 
  Under the new method the package of nonfood commodities 
covers 46 commodities, undifferentiated for urban and rural 
areas. So the difference in the value of the nonfood sufficiency 
limit between the urban and rural areas may be due to a 
difference in the volume and price of the commodities consumed. 
  The nonfood commodities were selected on the basis of the 
weight given to each commodity in the consumption pattern of the 
people, reflecting the quality, price and frequency [of the 
commodities] which the people consume. 
  Results of the Calculations 
  The Deputy Director of the BPS said that under the new 
method 
the poverty line for urban areas in 1993 was 27,905 rupiahs, 
which consists of a food sufficiency limit of 23,303 rupiahs and 
a nonfood sufficiency limit of 4,602 rupiahs. The rural poverty 
line was calculated at 18,244 rupiahs, which consists of a food 
sufficiency limit of 15,576 rupiahs and a nonfood sufficiency 
limit of 2,668 rupiahs. 
  He also explained that based on the new method there were 
8.7 
million poor people (13.45 percent) in urban areas in 1993 and 
17.2 million (13.79 percent) in rural areas. The number of poor 
people thus totaled 25.9 million (13.67 percent) in 1993. Under 
the old method the total number of poor people was 25.5 million, 
9.1 million (14.20 percent) in urban areas and 16.4 million 
(13.13 percent) in rural areas. The number and percentage of 
poor people under the new method was thus not much different 
from the figures obtained under the old method. 
  Under the new method, the number and percentage of poor 
people in rural areas was slightly higher than under the old 
method. On the other hand, the number and percentage of poor 
people in urban areas was lower than under the old method. This 
difference was caused, in part, by the fact that under the new 
method the nonfood sufficiency limit for rural areas was higher 
than under the old method, i.e., 2,668 rupiahs compared to 1,149 
rupiahs. The figures for the poverty level and the number and 
percentage of poor people at the provincial level in 1993 are 
shown in the table.

  [Text] According to a recent nationwide opinion poll 
conducted by ASAHI SHIMBUN on 8 and 9 May, 53 percent of 
respondents said "it was appropriate" for the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] to leave the coalition administration, 
while 26 percent said "it was not appropriate." Thus, the 
approval rate of the SDPJ's decision was much higher than the 
disapproval rate. Among the respondents who support the SDPJ, 
57 percent highly evaluated the party's secession from the 
coalition while 29 percent were critical of the secession. 
  In terms of party affiliation, it is noteworthy that 76 
percent of supporters for the Japan Communist Party [JCP] 
welcomed the SDPJ's secession from the coalition. Next to this 
figure, 67 percent of Sakigake [Harbinger] supporters and 57 
percent of Liberal Democratic Party supporters welcomed the 
SDPJ's action. 
  On the other hand, disapproval of the SDPJ's secession was 
conspicuously noted among supporters for the ruling coalition 
parties of the Tsutomu Hata cabinet. For example, the SDPJ's 
secession from the coalition was criticized by 42 percent of 
Democratic Socialist Party supporters, by 41 percent of Komeito 
supporters, and by 36 percent of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
supporters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michihiko Kano, representative of New Party </F>
Mirai, by an unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter; date 
and place not given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Does your party plan to 
participate in the new parliamentary group "Kaishin"? 
  [Kano] The Japan New Party and the Democratic Socialist 
Party [DSP] have asked us about it. Their thinking that reform 
should be carried out in all areas is essentially the same as 
ours. But we consider procedural matters as being important, 
too. We would like to make a decision after hearing views of 
parties concerned. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] At least, do you intend to 
participate in the decisionmaking bodies of the coalition 
parties -- like the representatives' conference? 
  [Kano] The nine-item basic policies agreed to by the 
coalition parties conform to our line of thinking. We would 
like to offer our efforts in pushing for the policies. We will 
participate in the decisionmaking bodies, if asked. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you view the moves being made 
by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] toward collaborating with each other? 
  [Kano] With the international community in a period of 
change, we must walk the way of reform. We cannot move 
backward. We must realize why we wanted to carry out political 
reform to begin with. What I want to do is to pursue this goal 
based on common policy ideals. People who want to be 
politicians must think about this point. That is the 
responsibility of politicians toward the people. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] If the LDP and the SDPJ decide to 
collaborate, they will be able to carry a no-confidence motion 
in the cabinet, too. 
  [Kano] Their collaboration must not be an illicit union. 
Both parties said so themselves. That is what I want to say to 
them. We must recall why political reform was necessary. We 
must push our policy from a new position. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There are people saying the House of 
Representatives should be dissolved once the budget is passed. 
  [Kano] The next general election should be held under a new 
election system since the Political Reform Bill has been passed. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you intend to expand the force 
of your party in the future? 
  [Kano] We will make efforts to have our party's position and 
basic thinking understood better. There are people who have 
actively sought political reform. We hope we will succeed in 
gaining understanding from a larger number of people. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There are all kinds of stories now 
circulating about your New Party Mirai. Some say it is leaning 
toward Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and some say the Mirai 
members defected from the LDP because of problems they had with 
their constituencies. 
  [Kano] I am aware that there are many rumors. But our 
actions are based on the belief that we should go for reform and 
act future-oriented. We cannot stake our political lives only 
on the human relationship. I hope you will understand the 
sincere resolve each of us made in taking the action of bolting 
the LDP and forming the new party and thus risking our own 
political lives. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is your position on the taxation 
sytem reform? 
  [Kano] It is part of economic reform, and the question lies 
in how best the assets, consumption, and income levies can be 
balanced. There is also the question of how the direct taxes and 
indirect taxes should be proportioned. It is important that we 
all discuss the matter frankly. In reviewing the matter, we 
will have to think about the future picture of Japan, too. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think an increase in the 
consumption tax rate would be unavoidable? 
  [Kano] The question is not whether to raise that tax, but 
why we must think about it. The vision for the future, the 
standard of lives for the people -- these things need to be 
thought out. We will have to think about the taxation system 
reform, thinking about all these things.

<F P=106> [Interview with Koshiro Ishida, director general of the </F>
Management and Coordination Agency and Komeito chairman, by an 
unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How will secession of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition affect an 
administrative reform program? 
  [Ishida] When the former cabinet decided on a midterm 
administrative reform outline, cabinet ministers from the SDPJ 
were also among those who agreed on it. SDPJ Chairman Murayama 
also said the party will take responsibility for what it is 
responsible for. Thus, the SDPJ has to fulfill its 
responsibility for administrative reform. As for deregulation, 
the government plans to submit 40 relevant bills to the Diet as 
one package during the current session. As for the information 
disclosure system, the government will ask the administrative 
reform committee, which will soon be established, to fully 
discuss the establishment of the system and its legislation. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Hata cabinet is called "a cabinet led 
by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito." 
  [Ishida] It was inevitable for Prime Minister Hata to give 
many cabinet posts to these two parties. But we do not need to 
feel so badly about it. The important thing is for the 
government to administer state affairs by placing emphasis on 
its policies. Tax reform is also a demand from society. The 
government has to promote reform while hearing opinions of the 
opposition parties. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Does Komeito plan to participate in the 
new parliamentary group Kaishin [Innovation]? 
  [Ishida] I think our party should consider joining the group 
and fully discuss it. From now on, each party should work to 
reorganize the existing parties into two forces. Otherwise, 
small parties will be defeated in the general election to be 
held under a single-seat constituency system. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think there is a possibility that 
the next general election following the dissolution of the lower 
house will be held under the current multiple-seat constituency 
system. 
  [Ishida] Some people have said it is inevitable to hold the 
general election under the multiple-seat system. This opinion 
is problematic because if the election is held under the current 
system, political reform will be delayed for two or three years. 
The people will never allow such a delay. We should deal with 
this issue after enacting at an early date the bills on new 
constituency boundaries for the single-seat electoral system. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The chief cabinet secretary said it is 
possible that the general election will be held in July under 
the new electoral system and without a period needed to make the 
new system known to the public. 
  [Ishida] Unlike the past, there are many news organizations 
covering political affairs. I think what he said is possible if 
the government informs the people of the new system through the 
news media.

  [Text] With regard to the question of whether (former 
Prime Minister) Morihiro Hosokawa should resign as leader of the 
Japan New Party [JNP], there is a rapidly increasing number of 
party members who hold the view that "he has no other choice but 
to resign." There has been growing criticism against his 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-oriented management of party 
affairs. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and other parties have 
also made an official request to summon Hosokawa as witness in 
connection with his loan from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking 
company. Therefore, most party members have come to the 
conclusion that "if Hosokawa remains in the post of party head, 
the party's split will be inevitable," (as stated by a senior 
JNP official). Hosokawa disclosed at a meeting of JNP Diet 
members of both houses on 9 May that he will hold a national 
meeting of party representatives as early as 21 May to hear 
their opinions on this matter. However, there is a possibility 
that he will announce his intention to resign before this 
meeting. 
  The JNP held separate meetings of Diet members according to 
their seniority on 9 May to discuss party management and other 
topics. The prevailing view among the participants was: "To 
rebuild the party, there is no other way but for Mr. Hosokawa to 
resign voluntarily." If Hosokawa should resign, it is certain 
that the party executives, who have been criticized for their 
stand on party management, will also be replaced. On the other 
hand, JNP members who have been considering leaving the party 
are now inclined to think that "if the leadership changes, this 
will open up prospects for the party's renewal." Mass secession 
is likely to be averted for the time being.

<F P=106> [Article by Yukio Suzuki, economic commentator: "Major </F>
Turning Point for Bureaucratic Nation; Merits, Demerits of 
Hosokawa-Style Dependence on "Ministry of Finance (MOF) and 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)"] 
  [Text] Even though the draft legislation of the 
Political Reform Law was rejected in the House of Councilors, 
the enigmatic government was somehow able to handle difficult 
issues after a fashion only because it had the support of an 
"allied force" composed of two mainstream economic agencies. 
<H5>  Mysterious Stability of Government </H5>
  The Hosokawa government was launched amidst the widespread 
use of popular terms such as "collapse of the 1955 political 
structure" and, with the exception of the slogan "non-Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP)" and "political reform" dedicated almost 
solely to election system debate, without developing hardly any 
clear-cut basic policy concerning matters such as diplomacy, 
security, and the economy. As generally expected, the Hosokawa 
government, which was initiated with the public's vague and 
diversified "hope for reform," is continue to falter in the face 
of intracoalition government conflict (especially friction 
between Shinseito and Komeito versus the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ]) and attacks from the LDP, which has now become 
a formidable opposition party. 
  Notwithstanding, Prime Minister Hosokawa himself--without 
showing any superficial signs of being affected by such 
"internal friction and external attacks"--has somehow survived 
the last year with a backdrop of favorable mass media commentary 
and a still high approval rating inspired by such commentary. In 
fact, the fuzzy personality and public popularity as his 
strength, Hosokawa has unconcernedly fended off criticism of his 
unstable political base and lack of specifics relative to policy 
matters and has managed to prolong the life of his government in 
a shrewd, resilient, and bold manner. 
  Ever since its installation, the Hosokawa government has 
been 
criticized by professional politicians for its dubious, 
amateurish performance during the policy decisionmaking process. 
It has also been repeatedly attacked by businessmen who are 
extreamely impatient and upset because of the worst recession of 
the post-World War II period. Additionally, those domestic and 
international sources hopeful of reform and who empathize with 
bold Clinton-style reform concepts harbor strong dissatisfaction 
because of the lack of specifics of his government's reform 
concept, although some similarities exist in the performance 
between the two leaders. 
  If it were the LDP government days, any single 
incident--such 
as, the undeniable "failure to deliver on a public pledge" of 
political reform draft bill to be carried over from 1993 to 
1994, the major delay in budget processing and economic 
countermeasures owing to the turmoil over political reform, and 
ineptness at handling the partial liberalization of rice 
imports--would have had the strong potential of forcing the 
government into resignation en masse or dissolution. However, if 
one were allowed a bit of vulgarity, the Hosokawa government 
appears to be unconcerned and skillfully manages to "barely" 
survive. 
  Even as I prepare this article, the fate of the Political 
Reform Law faces chaos, but eventually government will have to 
focus on the compilation and submission of the budget for fiscal 
year 1994 which include a package of economic measures. The 
problem lies with what will come next. Regardless of the outcome 
of the draft legislation on "political reform," in addition to 
acceleration of moves to reorganize the political sector (more 
precisely to reorganize political parties), the Clinton 
administration, which until now has given support to the 
reformist stance of the new government and avoided any action 
that might force Prime Minister Hosokawa into a predicament, 
will surely accelerate a barrage of attacks on Japan in an 
effort to conclude the economic framework negotiations that have 
come to a complete impasse. The strong statements issued by 
Treasury Secretary Bentsen when he visited Japan recently are 
vividly reflecting that prospect. 
  Moreover, there is the strong possibility that the 
employment 
situation will sharply worsen in early spring, without any 
prospect for breaking out of the recession. The voices of 
resentment from businesses because of the slowness of policy 
response will probably go up higher. The question is: How will 
the government survive this "dismal spring?" The crucial stage 
for the Hosokawa government lies in the future. 
  Of course, the main issue to be addressed in this article is 
not concerned with a prediction of future problems. One item 
this writer wishes to address here concerns that why this 
coalition government with complex interparty relations has been 
able to somehow manage to solve difficult national government 
issues including the rice problem and being able to survive, and 
politically and diplomatically almost unscathed at that. In that 
respect, this writer perceives a strange sense of stability. In 
addition, it appears that Prime Minister Hosokawa seem to be 
enjoying a considerable degree of calmness and confidence. The 
question is what is the real factor that sustains that 
confidence; i.e., what sustains the prime minister and his new 
government's "shrewdness." 
  As examples of main factors sustaining such strange sense of 
stability, we might facetiously mention the irresolute 
collaboration of the SDPJ which has lost all significance for 
existence beyond sustaining the government and which moves about 
in utter confusion in the face of intraparty turmoil, the 
powerful leadership and manipulative abilities of 
behind-the-scenes strongman Ichiro Ozawa and "princely" 
characteristics of Prime Minister Hosokawa himself. Another 
factor that might be mentioned is the "opposition offensive" of 
the LDP which lacks luster and drive because of the ineptness at 
handling intraparty coordination. 
  However, a factor which I wish to emphasize more than 
anything else is the very close interdependence between the new 
government versus the mainstream economic agencies represented 
by the MOF and MITI. It was this very factor that enabled the 
new government to somehow survive the past half year or so in 
managing policy matters without committing major errors, while 
serving as the foremost factor in backing up the strange 
stability of the new government. It was probably that very 
factor which enabled Prime Minister Hosokawa to exercise a 
degree of mental composure. 
<H5>  Belated Economic Measures </H5>
  The Hosokawa government in its initial days had 
energetically 
espoused slogans such as "down with the bureaucracy" and 
"decentralization of government" with the goal of "eliminating 
the collusive politicians-government-industry relationship." 
However, in reality, it has been almost entirely dependent on 
legislative, decisionmaking, and implementation of policies by 
mainstream agencies in charge of macroeconomics such as the MOF 
and MITI, and in substance, it is more dependent on bureaucratic 
leadership than was the case during the LDP government days. 
That is the very reason the mainstream agencies extend their 
absolute support. 
  On the other hand, because of that very reason, a 
significant 
gap exists in viewpoints between the government leaders and 
private economists concerning perceptions of the current 
economic conditions and the timing and methodology of economic 
measures including reduction in income taxes, causing the 
widespread criticism that the Hosokawa government relies heavily 
on bureaucratic judgments. In reality, ideas of the prime 
minister and government leaders concerning economic conditions 
and tax reform are almost the same as those of the MOF 
bureaucrats and the majority of the Tax Commission. Of special 
note is that the prime minister, Shinseito, and Komeito leaders 
clearly embrace ideas which side with the MOF on the timing and 
method to be followed in handling the reduction of income tax 
and offsetting the increase of consumption tax. 
  Although private sector's dissatisfaction and distrust have 
been inspired because of the nature of the policy response, the 
foregoing situation has not necessarily manifested itself in the 
basic distrust or sense of instability of the private sector 
against the government itself. Strange as it may seem, the 
mysterious sense of security held by the private sector for this 
government seem to rest with the fact that the latter relies on 
bureaucrats for the management of economic affairs. 
  If the government leaders were to engage in profligate 
spending, were individuals who recklessly intervened in policy 
matters in the private sector from one issue to the next, were 
extreme inflationists convinced that the only clever plan 
available were to resort to bubble economy measures, or, 
contrarily, were extreme deflationists espousing only the 
independent responsibility and restructuring of industry without 
approving any sort of government financial measures, the people 
and the economic sector would be overcome by a powerful sense of 
insecurity and would find it impossible to enjoy peace of mind. 
  Needless to say, from the standpoint of private sector 
sensibilities, bureaucratic policies are most likely incomplete, 
ineffective, too little, and too late. This writer is also one 
who has addressed the harmful effects of amateurish 
manipulations for many years and has repeatedly warned 
bureaucrats of the probable existence of "policy recession" and 
"bureaucratic recession" elements within the purview of current 
recessions which are referred to as "complex recessions" and 
"structural recessions." However, because of the sense of 
security that bureaucrats will continue to build steadily on the 
basic framework for financial and monetary policy and steer 
without major deviation from a basic structural policy (these 
words may reflect somewhat of an overvaluation), this writer may 
have expressed views that were derogatory relative to 
bureaucrats. It may be that some academicians and economists 
have had a tendency to voice criticisms because they felt a 
sense of security of such nature. 
  Many among the public should have been aware from some time 
back that Prime Minister Hosokawa, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Takemura, Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, and the new government leaders, with 
the exception of one or two, are all lacking in knowledge and 
experience in management of the macroeconomics. Rather, logic 
tells us that it is only natural that the leadership is obtuse 
and fumbles on management of the economy because it is weak on 
the subject of economics and therefore it is essentially the 
bureaucratic assistants who are in the wrong. Such logic is more 
convenient for the government leaders. The imperturbable stance 
of government leaders probably emanates from this circumstance. 
  I will repeat myself, but this writer entertains strong 
dissatisfaction and doubt concerning economic measures based on 
MOF initiatives. The Hosokawa government's response to recession 
so far lacks flexibility to a degree greater than that of the 
former LDP government. One reason is that it has forced itself 
into a self-conceived predicament because it espoused a slogan 
of system reform from the beginning and is unable to form a 
recession countermeasure without coordinating its contents with 
the slogan. I am in favor of deregulation and opening of markets 
and, aside from method and timing, I do not disagree with the 
basic policy of the Tax Commission calling for tax reform 
including an increase in consumption tax. 
  Generally speaking, deregulation expands private sector 
activities, increases investment opportunities, and stimulates 
the economy as a whole. It has a major impact in providing a 
positive influence on the restructuring of industry. However, in 
those industry sectors that were resting on their laurels 
relative to vested interests, deregulation induces a transitory 
reduction in incomes and employment which conflicts with 
economic policies. This dilemma can be resolved only by a 
transitory expansion in government financial liability. 
  I can well appreciate MOF bureaucratic concern that the 
government has "Completely abandoned sound financial policies," 
resistance to simplistic hopes for expansion of financial 
liabilities and stubborn insistence on legally offsetting major 
income tax cuts with a hike in consumption tax, in the face of 
accumulated total emergency measures plans totalling 30 trillion 
yen, government bond debt totalling close to 180 trillion yen, 
and single-year government bond servicing costs reaching 15 
trillion yen. 
  The MOF stubbornly adheres to its position out of concern 
for 
the SDJP's "immature disposition" to oppose a hike in 
consumption tax under any circumstance and for the majority of 
politicians who promised, but in reality failed, to favor a tax 
increase in connection with elections and opted for the advance 
and sole reduction of taxes. MOF bureaucrats also have strong 
memories of the excessive stimulative influence that government 
financial measures had on the bubble economy. There are more 
than just a few in industry who now embrace the view that the 
economy is nearing a "turn for the better." They say that things 
look especially gloomy because we are nearing that turn. 
However, bureaucrats warn that, if we are so close to the 
turning point and we take excessive financial stimulative 
measures now, we just might regret doing so at a later date. 
  However, realities of the economy do not allow for much 
optimism. The current recession is a mixed bag of three 
conditions including the cyclical factor involving liquidation 
of excessive investments and excessive supply, structural 
factors involving response to changes in domestic and 
international market structures, and instabilities in financial 
systems occasioned by a sharp drop in stock and land values as a 
result of advances in an asset economy. There is no small risk 
of a spiraling shrinkage of final demand if we depend solely on 
restructuring of businesses resulting in additional personnel 
reductions. Financial policies which center on lower interest 
rates are no longer effective and it seems the economy is 
falling into a situation reminiscent of the early stages of the 
world and Showa-era panics. 
  A necessary move at this stage is action to counteract the 
shrivelled psychology of business, consumers, and investors as 
well as the insecure psychology for the future and it appears 
that we have no choice but to resort to bold Keynesian financial 
policies--based on the application of tax reductions and 
issuance of government deficit bonds--to cope with declines in 
stock prices, vicious cycle of accumulated debts, and the fear 
of a recurring rise in future yen valuations because of a drop 
in investments in the United States and persistent trade 
surpluses being accumulated against the United States. Even if 
we were to legally establish a hike in consumption taxes to 
offset income tax reductions, one wonders if we can suspend its 
implementation until prospects are clear for an economic 
recovery. The current government financial deficit is, in 
reality, serving, in a sense, as a real economic countermeasure, 
while the very fact that the government will have its hands full 
in an effort to redeem government deficit bonds will, as in the 
past, have the effect of restraining future profligate 
government spending and function to justify spending cuts along 
with deregulation and government reform. In that instance, we 
economists will assume responsibility in extending our humble 
support to the MOF. 
  Increasing arguments are being heard for the use of public 
funds or for establishment of a buy-out agency to purchase bad 
loans of financial institutions, but the public voices strong 
opinion that such action should be preceded by an inquiry into 
the responsibilities which reside with the financial 
institutions. Bureaucrats must keenly be awaken that, financial 
institution administration over the years, the MOF was 
responsible for pampering the financial institutions and that 
the assumption of makeshift policies relative to administrative 
guidance such as peacekeeping operations and restraints on 
issuance of additional stock without deployment of an adequate 
basic demand policy will make it difficult to avoid "adverse 
market reaction." 
<H5>  Background Relative to MITI's Household Disturbance </H5>
  Let us go back off to another facet. How are the other 
agencies coping in comparison to the close relationship between 
the agencies concerned with macroeconomics and the new 
government. As widely known, zoku Diet members of the LDP period 
have made a wholesale exit from the various agencies such as 
Construction; Transportation; and Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries. Needless to say, this does not mean that all contacts 
with former zoku Diet members have ceased. However, advantages 
of maintaining contacts with LDP Diet members who are no longer 
part of the ruling party are very limited. Moreover, since one 
can logically expect a "clampdown" from the ruling party, 
especially Shinseito, bureaucrat visits to LDP Diet members have 
clearly declined sharply. 
  Those changes, whether good or bad, have emancipated 
bureaucrats from intervention from politicians who were expert 
in the policies of the various ministries and agencies. At the 
same time, bureaucrats have provided thorough training to 
ministers who are now leaders of the former opposition parties 
and have done an excellent job in tailoring them into spokesmen 
for the ministries and agencies. It appears that the coalition 
government which does not possess a powerful policy research 
committee organization like the LDP has, in reality, delegated 
overall coordination of policy requests from such ministries and 
agencies to the macroeconomic agency comprised of MOF 
bureaucrats which is accustomed to handling assessments and 
overall coordination. 
  This writer does not believe the existence of zoku Diet 
members was wrong in every respect. Diet members with a lengthy 
history of involvement with a specific government sector possess 
greater knowledge as well as hands-on experience in the sector 
than bureaucrats who serve a limited tenure in the applicable 
specialty. Much respect probably should be afforded to judgments 
backed up by the experience of such individuals. The problem 
arises when such experience is used to distort fairness in 
government, to favor specific businesses and when such action 
leads to bribery. 
  The longer a government remains in power, the more prone it 
is to engage in corruption. Under the auspices of the long-term 
LDP administration, we cannot deny that intervention into 
government administration of zoku Diet members in recent years 
had a tendency to focus on the maintenance of special industry 
interests and to protect vested rights rather than respond to 
novel government needs covering the public's economic 
perspective. The ministries and agencies probably could have 
utilized zoku Diet members to their advantage to pressure the 
MOF or industry, but it is fact that the existence of zoku Diet 
members had, at times, the contrary effect of obstructing the 
response of ministries and agencies to new government needs. 
  The fact that bureaucrats in the various ministries and 
agencies displayed unusual enthusiasm in the reassessment of 
policies at one time under the new government probably was a 
reflection of such accumulated resentment. On the other hand, 
fear that uncertainty of the coalition government's policy 
stance would bring chaos to government financial and industrial 
policies inspired a pathetic sense of mission for MOF and MITI 
officials who showed signs of dedicating themselves to visit to 
the Prime Minister's Residence and ruling party leaders. 
  Speaking of coordination between bureaucrats and political 
leaders, we can say that the partial opening of rice markets 
agreed upon in the final phase of the Uruguay Round came about 
as a result of behind-the-scenes negotiations conducted in 
Geneva by special foreign and agriculture and forestry officials 
since the Miyazawa government days and close exchange of ideas 
between them and leaders of the current ruling parties. This 
effort can be labelled as a government-led solution which 
excluded intervention by zoku Diet members of both ruling and 
opposition parties to the very end. Such an approach resulted in 
considerable turmoil until the final phase of negotiations, but 
now that the decision has been made, it can be clearly treated 
as a victory of sorts. 
  However, among current ruling party leaders, there seems to 
be some who exercise strict caution over bureaucrats who do not 
take the ruling party intentions seriously, regardless of 
whether they are from a mainstream or non-mainstream government 
agency, or if they have excessive contacts with the LDP. Above 
all, there is the possibility that the ruling party will 
intervene in government agency personnel assignments to restrain 
such actions of bureaucrats and as a procedure to exercise 
maximum persuasion to directly eliminate such actions. 
  Most likely, even if we set aside the merits of the 
disposition of the case or any inquiry into MITI Minister 
Kumagai's true intention in connection with the demand for the 
resignation, the issue whereby the Industrial Policy Bureau 
director of MITI was forced to resign after assuming 
responsibility for promoting a son of a former MITI 
administrative vice minister to enhance his prospects as a 
political candidate must be assumed as having been used to warn 
bureaucrats as a whole by penalizing one official for a single 
infraction and to serve notice that any bureaucrat deemed 
intimate with the LDP is subject to disposal as a result of 
ruling party politician's intervention in bureaucratic personnel 
matters and to restrain their contacts with the LDP. However, 
unless one is the type to "favor control by force" or one that 
has the will to use such methods, he will probably hesitate to 
put them to use. Such methods are not compatible with 
politicians who use a gentle approach, such as in the case of 
Prime Minister Hosokawa or Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura. 
  There are more than a few bureaucrats in the MOF and MITI 
who 
are close to Mr. Ozawa. Among them are those who attended Mr. 
Ozawa's study group and participated in the compilation of his 
book titled, Blueprint for Building a New Japan. 
Many former and current bureaucrats of MITI surmised that among 
MITI bureaucrats close to Mr. Ozawa, there was a group which 
teamed up with a very limited group of former bureaucrats of 
MITI, who were unhappy with MITI personnel assignments in the 
days of the former vice minister and plotted the dismissal of 
influential personnel connected to the former vice minister and 
close to the LDP. That situation gave birth to the mysterious 
document which denounced the former vice minister, leading to 
talk of an indictment and to MITI Minister Kumagai's demand for 
resignation. 
  Kasumigaseki culture which provides for the practice of 
granting a promotion in name only to enhance the position of a 
political candidate is certainly not a desirable one from the 
standpoint of public sensitivities. It is not wrong to hold the 
chief cabinet secretary of the time responsible for the 
personnel action. Further, the issue and circumstances may make 
it unavoidable for a minister to take direct personnel action 
without following the normal personnel appointment and dismissal 
procedure of going through the vice minister and the chief 
cabinet secretary. However, the question is, is the issue of 
such a gravity as to call for resignation? 
  What is difficult to comprehend is that the incident 
originated with insidious intraministry manipulation emanating 
from a mysterious document and that the document has given the 
impression of having influenced personnel assignments. Above 
all, the only obvious reason for demanding the resignation was 
to assume responsibility for the promotion in name only. The 
reason had nothing to do with a disagreement in policy matters 
with another minister, a major policy error, or a grievous act. 
  If a personnel action of the foregoing nature is to be 
declared undesirable, we should question all personnel actions 
of this nature of the past. However, neither the prime minister 
nor other government leaders have made any move to take such 
action. The existence of a degree of tension at all times among 
politicians or cabinet officials and bureaucrats is in some 
respects desirable so as to serve as a mutual check. However, it 
is difficult to understand why a bureaucrat would be forced into 
resignation solely because of the aforementioned reason. The 
lack of an inquiry into similar cases in the past relative to 
other ministries is even more strange. It appears that the issue 
still leaves much to be debated from the aspect of guaranteeing 
employment status under the provisions of the National Public 
Service Law. 
  These comments are of a postscript nature, but as far as 
this 
writer understands, the former Industrial Policy Bureau director 
who resigned does not play golf, did not allow himself to engage 
in shady relations with merchants, and was a nice fellow who 
relied solely on personal abilities. He was an expert on the 
United States and had many friends in the United States. U.S. 
officials knew him as a tough negotiator and highly rated and 
respected his skills as a mediator. The Japanese Government has 
lost an essential human resource just when U.S. dissatisfaction 
with Japan is on the verge of explosion. Moreover, if it is true 
that his ideas and capabilities played a prominent role in 
forming MITI's economic measures, industry structural reforms, 
and deregulation, the question arises as to why he was suddenly 
discarded as a key bureaucrat in a very untimely manner just as 
the management of the economy and industrial policy are reaching 
a major turning point with a high degree of urgency. 
  In any event, the case just discussed has left a bad 
impression and has clearly impacted negatively on MITI's image. 
Internationalization and maturation of the economy will no doubt 
call for even more reductions and reorganizations in many past 
forms of government authority and systems designed to provide 
for the protection and growth of industry. That being the case, 
it is not unnatural for bureaucrats to exercise concern in 
personnel assignments and future position assignments and it is 
not difficult to understand the excessive sensitivities directed 
at rankings by those in charge of personnel evaluations. 
However, if such conditions served as the root cause for the 
recent case, it would not be an overstatement to say that not 
only the organization itself but both current and former 
bureaucrats have themselves reached a substantially advanced 
stage of mental degeneration. 
<H5>  MOF-MITI "Allied Forces" </H5>
  Let us change the topic. Just because we say the Hosokawa 
government is highly dependent on macroeconomic ministries and 
agencies does not mean that the prime minister is not surrounded 
by self-styled and third-party brains. Even among those 
individuals about whom this writer is familiar, they have 
contacts with private-sector economists who are leaning to 
anti-MOF and anti-bureaucratic group. However, in the interim, 
while his government base is fragile and under the situation 
where he has a shortage of human resources within the new 
parties with practical and theoretical policy capabilities, the 
prime minister probably will not be able to muster the frame of 
mind to deviate substantially from the policy path devised by 
bureaucrats. He will no doubt avoid making enemies out of the 
bureaucratic mainstream. 
  According to widely circulated reports, MOF bureaucratic 
leaders have met from early on and have established very close 
relations with Mr. Ichiro Ozawa who is the behind-the-scenes 
strongman of the new government. Further, it is said that 
leaders of the MOF and MITI maintain close personnel 
connections. The cooperative stance between the MOF and MITI has 
been especially obvious in the string of past debates on 
economic measures and tax system reform and the two ministries 
have been unmistakably and sarcastically referred to as "allied 
forces." 
  These two agencies once maintained a cat-and-dog 
relationship 
and one wonders what is at the bottom of this close connection 
and how long the "honeymoon" will last. Setting aside the 
personal relationships of the leaders of the two ministries, no 
doubt there is major advantage in maintaining the cooperative 
stance of the two ministries for the foreseeable future. 
  As an example, we can examine the issue concerning the 
distribution of public works funding. The MOF has for some time 
preferred to revise the method of distribution for public works 
funds which have been fixed for many years on the basis of 
Ministry of Construction (MOC) bureau breakout into a priority 
system which is responsive to government investment requirements 
in the areas of welfare, environment, education, and medical 
facilities. In other words, it was seeking a revision in the 
public works funds distribution process based primarily on civil 
engineering projects. Surfacing of the general contractor 
scandals has provided a favorable opportunity for such a change. 
However, resistance of engineers in the MOC is formidable, while 
the zoku Diet members became involved and made it impossible to 
proceed with the idea. 
  Meanwhile, MITI has been strongly dissatisfed with the 
previous system of distributing public works funding based on a 
central role played by the MOC. MITI bureaucrats entertain even 
the idea that public works investments should logically include 
technical development investments as a means of creating public 
assets which are common to humanity. Although immediate 
realization of such an idea may be difficult, an attempt is 
being made to surface it as a policy issue providing leverage to 
the electronic information industry where Japan now lags by 10 
years behind the United States, to promote computerization of 
universities and medical facilities, and to catch up even a step 
closer to the U.S. "Gore Concept" on a near-term basis through 
the formation of a nationwide multiplestage information network. 
The definition of "social infrastructure" as advocated by the 
MOC since the LDP days includes such items as discussed above. 
As beginners, MOC influenced the Ministry of Education, Ministry 
of Transportation, and Ministry of Health and Welfare into 
including funding for computerization and networking of schools, 
hospitals, and transportation facilities. Approval of future 
major funding for information systems, computerization and 
networking must be handled as a separate issue, but partial 
introduction of public works funding for "new social 
infrastructure" projects of this nature serve as desirable 
material for the MOF in revising the distribution of existing 
funds. And, as stressed by MITI, such projects have a greater 
impact on stimulating business activity in related industries in 
comparison to the comparatively declining multiplier effect of 
"civil engineering" projects. The "honeymoon" for the MOF and 
MITI found its beginning relative to these developments. Both 
the 13 trillion yen final LDP integrated economic plan as well 
as the 6 trillion yen initial Hosokawa government emergency plan 
involved many policies and the delicate distribution of public 
funds based on ideas furnished by MITI experts. 
  However, more deeply rooted reasons existed for the 
formation 
of the MOF-MITI alliance. Those reasons relate, as stated 
earlier, to the fact that MITI and MOF are facing a major 
turning point amidst progress in the deregulation and maturation 
of the economy. Although both ministries deal with issues of a 
differing nature and substance, both face a situation in which 
they must thoroughly reexamine their respective administrative 
systems and policy systems from a new perspective. 
  The MOF would probably like to borrow from the knowledge of 
MITI concerning micro-industrial information systems relative to 
how changes in future industrial and employment structures and 
international economic trends will affect systemic 
restructurings in management of financial and monetary policies, 
while MITI competes with the Ministry of Post and 
Telecommunications in the radiowave and communications sector 
and many sectors related to novel needs of industry affect 
regulating authority of other ministries and agencies, making 
affiliation with the MOF desirable in terms of exercising its 
authority relative to other ministries and agencies. 
  Deregulation and elimination of domestic and international 
price differentials which are basic policies of the Hosokawa 
government are as a matter of principle welcomed by MITI which 
has already assumed a basic theme calling for 
internationalization in terms of revamping the distribution 
systems and reducing manufacturing costs. Coordination with the 
MOF is also necessary in guiding changes in antimonopoly and 
financial policies so that MITI attain its own policy goals. 
  Of special note is that MITI is now in the position of 
taking 
the initiative in reinforcing the regulation of cartels and the 
implementation of the antimonopoly law, while actively 
collaborating with the Fair Trade Commission which has close 
personnel connections with the MOF to include a review of the 
group-escort format for exercising government control over 
administrative guidance to financial institutions. Concurrently, 
MITI is advocating policy aid for mergers and consolidations 
which are the fruits of industrial restructurings and the 
necessity to adopt the holding company system in attaining 
sophistication in making integrated strategic decisions by 
businesses and business groups under multinationalization and 
diversification moves, but the Fair Trade Commission is not in 
favor of the latter proposal which will remain as an important 
future issue for further coordination. 
  Although there is no need to mention this fact again, the 
"1955 System" has been tied in closely with the various economic 
systems, such as government financial administration, business, 
and monetary systems--which existed to a great degree as a 
mutually cooperative, mutually dependent system of political, 
bureaucratic, and industrial entities rich in Japanese-style 
culture. 
  Such economic systems were based on the original "postwar 
system" which existed from the time of World War II defeat in 
1945 to the 1970's. The "postwar system" reflected the 
structural "interruption" taking place from prewar to the 
wartime days and was based on the "postwar democratization" 
policies of the Supreme Command Allied Powers encompassing the 
dismantling of the zaibatsu [conglomerate] and deconcentration 
immediately following the war, adaptation of the Antimonopoly 
Law, agricultural reform, nurturing of labor unions, women's 
suffrage, and human and organizational "continuity" from prewar 
and wartime periods in many areas which were preserved to 
facilitate occupation policies such as the strong economic 
bureaucracy, financial system, and industrial organization. 
Although such "interruption" and "continuity" factors were 
intertwined, the "1938-1941 framework" emanating from the 
national mobilization structure of the Konoe cabinet days was 
the basic structure used to devise a system as a result of an 
adaptation, modification, recasting, discarding, and selection 
process, amidst a drastic reform leading to "postwar 
democratization." 
  The late Mr. Saburo Okita skillfully referred to the special 
nature of the process as an "effective amalgamation of market 
mechanisms and the government's systematic guidance," and 
although the gradual conversion of Japan into market economy and 
policy, which emphasized supply-side economics under a postwar 
system, were, in effect, not very conducive to the thorough 
adaptation of market economy principles, they had the effect of 
providing for considerably lower public economic costs relative 
to reconstruction and growth. Ministries played a central policy 
role were the MOF which controlled capital supply and demand 
from a government finance aspect in coordination with the Bank 
of Japan and MITI which worked on the supply of commodities and 
the building of a foundation for information systems. It is also 
a fact that the key to the policy management of both ministries 
lay in the close relationships reflected in the 
government-industry cooperative systems. 
  Needless to say, these systems were repeatedly revised over 
a 
period of 50 years. Particularly, since the latter half of the 
1970's when the Japanese economy was subject to a quickening 
pace of liberalization and decontrol, there was a gradual 
dismantling or change in the systems and many practices, which 
were considered special characteristics of the "Japan model," 
such as government methods of intervening in the private sector 
or methods concerning interindustry business entity cooperation. 
With the first phase of the 1980's as a turning point, 
industrial policy was especially affected by a major conversion 
from administration of direct regulation and intervention for 
the sake of protecting, nurturing, and strengthening competitive 
capabilities of manufacturing industries to administration based 
on indirect guidance centered on deregulation, consumer 
interests, emphasis of environmental matters, and disclosure of 
information. We need not repeat that such a move created many 
derivative problems. 
  In contrast, we see the inability to unshackle 
administration 
from the inertia of direct regulation and direct intervention 
with a strong protective quality in those areas of the economy, 
which are weak in terms of international competitiveness or 
plagued by low productivity, such as agriculture, distribution, 
and construction. Such areas have been hotbeds for general 
contractor corruption and have caused abnormal political 
imbroglios, such as that pertaining to the partial decontrol of 
rice imports. 
  Further, although it can be said that we finally witnessed 
the full-scale liberalization and decontrol of financial 
institutions in recent years, we have not seen a complete 
removal of the psychological inertia inherent in long years of 
protective administration based on the previously mentioned 
group-escort concept. We can say that this factor is the root 
cause of previously mentioned conditions such as various 
scandals occurring in connection with the bursting of the bubble 
economy including obtuseness of a sense of self-responsibility 
of financial institutions and ineffective government responses 
and the current problems concerning the accumulation of bad 
loans. Further, throughout the economic system, we see numerous 
legal and systemic areas of neglect that represent relics of 
control-type legislation of the wartime and postwar eras, such 
as the Bank of Japan Law, Food Control Law, Agriculture Land 
Law, and Land and Housing Leasing Law. We also see the existence 
of many industry laws which are relics of government 
protectiveness of industry which serve to preserve government 
inertia in terms of the tendency to protect industry and to give 
priority to protection of the manufacturer. 
  In the past, the Hosokawa government vociferously espoused 
"deregulation" and "decentralization of government," whether the 
matter concerned short-term economic measures or medium- and 
long-term structural reform policies. It is probably true that 
the basic goal in such pronouncements emanates from the 
awareness of the need to radically revise the "postwar systems," 
as mentioned previously. However, ranging from emergency 
measures to the final report of the Economic Reform Research 
Committee, many items have been listed on the deregulation 
agenda, the list looks attractive and literature appealing for 
the changes reflect a grand style, but there has been a dearth 
of actual progress in realizing the proposed changes. 
  Presently all policy matters are being held in abeyance 
pending progress on political reform. Thus, one questions the 
degree to which the government will be able to seriously cope 
with deregulation, correction of domestic and international 
price differentials, and government structural reform. This 
writer's estimation is that, even if progress is somehow made on 
political reform and restructuring takes place in sectors of 
industry plagued by recession, the deregulation will make very 
little progress except the areas where there will be limited 
resistance of bureaucrats and industry, and that it will be 
impossible to take any action in the area of bureaucratic 
systems themselves. We may see some progress, but it will be 
within the scope desired or permitted by the mainstream economic 
ministries and agencies such as the MOF and MITI. 
<H5>  Japan's Environment and Status of Bureaucrats </H5>
  The characteristic that bureaucrats provide initiatives and 
the private sectors depend on the bureaucrats will not change 
easily, no matter how long the Hosokawa government lasts and as 
long as we do not see the formation of an extremely powerful 
stable government. Moreover, there is no guarantee that the 
recent election system reform will give birth to such a stable 
government. Then, the question becomes, does that mean we face a 
genuine predicament? I believe such is not necessarily the case. 
  The various economic systems of the past as they applied to 
Japanese culture were such that they functioned to provide 
mutual surveillance and mutual assistance among economic 
entities within the context of government-private sector 
relationships, i.e., functioned as checks and balances. On the 
other hand, they were of a nature that bred so-called collusion 
or a simplistic "sense of mutual interdependence." It was a 
system that made industry very susceptible to widespread 
collusive relationships, but one wonders if it is desirable to 
manage economic affairs so that the competitive principle is 
permeated throughout all aspects or whether the spread of the 
spontaneous form of collusion should be approved as long as it 
does not become too obvious. Setting aside debate from a purely 
economic standpoint, if we premise the question on the 
perceptions or actions and mechanisms of various economic 
entities where collusion is a part of the Japanese culture, 
frankly speaking, it is difficult to explicitly differentiate 
between right and wrong. 
  However, if simplistic "interdependence" should distort the 
efficiency of the economy or the rationality of distribution of 
resources and capital, especially if such practices should cause 
an absence of transparency for outsiders, then, such practices 
should be denounced. Moreover, if collusion between politicians, 
bureaucrats, and businessmen lead to distribution of rights only 
to selected interest groups, cornering of public funds, and 
corruptions, then it is only logical that thorough reform action 
should be taken. 
  However, as suggested by Ronald P. Dore, professor of London 
University, "It is questionable whether the market supremacy 
principle will lead to a recovery in the Japanese economy." Both 
the Japanese government-private sector cooperative system and 
business management and employment systems still contain major 
advantages relative to efficient management of the economy as a 
whole and in terms of eliminating inequality. As long as 
efforts--to eliminate abuses of the previously mentioned nature 
such as "collusion among special interest groups" and "priority 
for insiders"--are not neglected through administrative 
litigation system reform and revision of commercial law, the 
maintenance of practices of the foregoing nature can be 
adequately espoused before the world. 
  Conversion to a political initiative system as espoused by 
Mr. Ichiro Ozawa in his book titled, Blueprint for Buildig 
a New Japan would be meaningless and, in fact, would even 
cause many problems, unless we can realize conditions such as an 
improvement in the quality of politicians, establishment of 
adequate staffing to support the politicians, and organization 
of private sector think tanks to counter the bureaucratic 
system. Such conditions do not exist in Japan at this time. One 
possible approach would be to execute direct government reform 
in the format of personnel reductions as contained in the 
Clinton-Gore concept embodied in the U.S. "Plan to Eliminate 
250,000 Federal Jobs," transfer a large number of highly 
qualified bureaucrats to serve as assistants to politicians and 
political parties, and as employees of think tanks, to guarantee 
them social status above those of bureaucrats as well as 
generous pay. However, it is doubtful that reform of this nature 
can be realized in Japan in the near future. 
  We must consider such problems as the widespread loss of 
efficiency associated with the U.S. Government turnover of 
political appointees relative to a change in administration and 
methods associated with adherence to neutrality by bureaucrats 
under the European parliamentary system, and position 
bureaucrats with a status which is appropriate for the Japanese 
environment. The act of engaging in ill-advised simplistic 
espousal of "respect for politicians and disrespect for 
bureaucrats" as seen with some commentators and politicians 
reeks of ignorance and meaningless ideology.

  [Text] Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet left Hanoi on Wednesday 
for an official friendship visit to Myanmar [Burma]. Here is a 
review of relations between Vietnam and Myanmar: 
  It is the first official visit to Myanmar by a Vietnamese 
prime minister since the two countries established diplomatic 
relations in 1975. The visit takes place at a time when the two 
countries have viewed advantages for further development. Both 
Vietnam and Myanmar have been undergoing a period of renovation 
and reform and have followed an opened-door policy, a market 
economy, and a foreign policy to befriend all nations. This 
visit is also a part of Vietnam's policy to broaden friendship 
and cooperation with all nations in the region, including 
Myanmar. The visit to Myanmar by the Vietnamese prime minister 
also takes when peace, stability, and cooperation in the 
Asia-Pacific region have been strengthened and consolidated. 
  Though Vietnam and Myanmar officially established diplomatic 
relations in 1975, they have had relations since 1947. In 1958, 
the late Vietnamese President Ho Chi Minh visited Myanmar and 
Myanmar has helped Vietnam in agriculture. Myanmar attaches 
great importance to its relationship and cooperation with 
Vietnam. Most recently, the two countries exchanged delegations 
at ministerial level and have agreed to strengthen cooperation 
in afforestation, agriculture, and exploitation of natural 
resources. Vietnam and Myanmar also wish to join effort with 
other countries along the Mekong River to exploit water 
resources. 
  The visit to Myanmar, the large country of Southeast Asia to 
be visited by a Vietnamese prime minister, will contribute to 
the building of Southeast Asia into a zone of peace, 
cooperation, and stability.

  [Text] Dear friends: Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has held 
talks with Senior General Than Shwe, prime minister of the Union 
of Myanmar [Burma]. The talks took place in the afternoon of 11 
May in the capital, Rangoon. Also attending the talks on the 
Vietnamese side were Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and 
members of our government delegation. On the Burmese side were 
Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw and many high-ranking Burmese 
Government officials. 
  Speaking on this occasion, Prime Minister Than Shwe again 
stated that he was delighted to welcome Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet and his wife as well as other members of the Vietnamese 
delegation on their friendship visit to the Union of Myanmar. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet thanked His Excellency Prime 
Minister Than Shwe and his wife for their solemn and cordial 
reception. He also said that he was very pleased to visit their 
beautiful country and meet the Burmese people, who are 
well-known for their diligence and hospitality. 
  Prime Minister Than Shwe and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
exchanged information on each country's situation and discussed 
orientations and measures to further strengthen the traditional 
friendship and good cooperation between the two countries. The 
two prime ministers also exchanged views on a number of regional 
and international issues of common concern. The talks took 
place in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual understanding. 
  Also on the afternoon of 11 May, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, 
his wife, and the comrades accompanying him toured the Myanmar 
Precious Stones Joint Enterprise in Rangoon. On this occasion, 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and members of our government 
delegation saw with their own eyes a huge blue jade weighing as 
much as 33 tons on display in front of the enterprise. The 
prime minister toured a number of facilities for processing 
precious stones and exchanged views with leading officials on 
the management and exploitation of precious stones and joint 
processing ventures in this field, which constitute one of the 
three economic sectors in which the Burmese state has a monopoly 
and which yield great income. 
  Dear friends: On the evening of 11 May, Senior General Prime 
Minister Than Shwe and his wife hosted a grand banquet in honor

government delegation. Also attending the function on the

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Sitting Duck' Becoming Troublesome for </F>
Government?"] 
  [Text] The leaders of the Chuan coalition should have been 
dancing with joy after a drug scandal blew up in the face of the 
opposition faction. An immediate effect was that they have been 
given a welcome respite from an opposition move to call for a 
no-confidence debate over the unimpressive performance of the 
administration. 
  As the mystery shrouding the past deeds of Chat Thai MP 
Thanong Siriprichaphong is being unraveled with more 
embarrassing evidence involving his alleged role in marijuana 
consignments to the U.S., Thai authorities appear reluctant to 
be put on the spot with the lawmaker. A nagging question from 
the public is "why so?" 
  Thanong, proprietor of the Little Duck Group of hotel and 
entertainment chains, has become an ugly duckling for Chat Thai 
Party and the whole opposition block which have been dismayed by 
a sudden reversal of fortune. Newly-elected Chat Thai leader 
Banhan Sinlapa-acha must have been particularly upset by the 
jinx which had further dimmed his chances of being in the 
government by whatever means he deems possible. 
  The scandal has made all senior officials in law enforcement 
and drug suppression look very foolish. First they said they 
had not been aware of Thanong's path to his current vast 
fortune. Yielding to more pressing questions, they conceded 
that they had quite substantial information about the MP's 
alleged role in drug trafficking. 
  The public is frustrated on many points after hearing hasty 
explanations from Thanong as well as government authorities. 
Thanong categorically denied on May 6 that he had no idea about 
the assets seized by U.S. authorities, but conceded on Tuesday 
that he had indeed owned the property and a limousine in 
California. The exposed falsehood was sufficient to wash away 
whatever innocence he had claimed. 
  Any prosecutor having Thanong on the defense stand and with 
that kind of admission would certainly be rubbing his hands in 
glee. But wait a minute. What we heard later from government 
officials was perplexing. From all comments, it boiled down to 
something like this: they weren't quite sure whether legal 
actions could be taken against the lawmaker who is being accused 
by U.S. authorities of trafficking in narcotics. 
  "There is not yet any evidence to implicate him," they said. 
This is really funny. They made the statement even before there 
was any attempt to start an investigation. The Police 
Department is silent. The Interior Ministry officials are 
distancing themselves from the "sitting duck'' who is now in the 
line of fire of U.S. legal potshots. 
  The Narcotics Suppression Unit has not displayed any 
enthusiasm to launch a probe, despite a forced admission that 
there was substantial record of suspected illegal activities. 
The Office of the Attorney General did not seem interested in 
finding out whether there are grounds for legal actions. 
  We wonder why, because the whole mess is making a mockery of 
our creaking legal machinery. 
  But more revealing yesterday was an explanation from 
American 
authorities that there had been a plan to arrest the MP if he 
showed up in the United States. This should be dreadful enough 
for Thanong to change his bravado that he intended to prove his 
innocence in any U.S. court of law. He will be lucky enough, 
from now on, to stay away from the long arm of the American law 
whenever he travels outside Thailand. 
  There are too many fine points involved. But there are 
things to be done. Thanong must discontinue his House 
membership to reduce the negative image on the institution. The 
government must start investigations right away on this 
explosive scandal. If not, it must explain to the public why 
the MP should be exempted from due process of the law to clear 
his name. 
  If the government is unmoved, it would not be a surprise to 
see Chat Thai and other opposition MPs from Chat Phathana and 
Social Action parties come up soon with an audacious demand that 
Prime Minister Chuan resign to show his responsibility, if 
Thanong refuses to quit. 
  Knowing full well the extent of their political scruples, we 
believe that they certainly can go that far.

<F P=106> [By Ophat Bunlom] </F>
  [Text] The Thai government should honor its extradition 
treaty with the United States and send Nakhon Phanom MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong to stand trial in that country where he is 
accused of having smuggled in 45 tones of marijuana between 1973 
and 1987, according to a legal expert. 
  Phanat Thatsaniyanon, a member of the government's mutual 
legal assistance committee which handles the legal aspects of 
extraditions, said the Thai government should comply with a 
request by a U.S. court to have Thanong extradited to answer to 
drug smuggling charges although under the Thai-U.S. treaty, the 
Thai government can use its discretion. 
  "If the Thai government decides not to extradite Thanong to 
stand trial in the United States, it must be able to explain 
why. The Thai government cannot just cite 'national pride' for 
not honoring the treaty," Phanat said. 
  "The international community has come a long way toward a 
borderless world, with increasing cooperation among countries, 
and Thailand should not hold back by stubbornly adhering to 
false national pride," he said. 
  Phanat said the U.S. government had complied with requests 
by 
Thailand for the extradition of Thai citizens, including the 
case of So Thanawisut, who fled to the United States after being 
charged with masterminding a murder in Thailand several years 
ago. 
  He said the U.S. government had consistently honored the 
extradition treaty because it attached great importance to 
bilateral cooperation in this area. 
  Phanat said in a Thai-U.S. extradition treaty ratified some 
60 years ago, Thailand had made it a point not to send its own 
citizens to stand trial in the United States under any 
circumstance because of national pride. The agreement has since 
been replaced by the Thai-U.S. extradition treaty of 1990, which 
allows the Thai government to use its discretion on a 
case-by-case basis. 
  Under normal procedures, the U.S. government will send an 
extradition request to the Thai Foreign Ministry which in turn 
will pass it on to the Police Department. The Police Department 
will ask the Office of the Attorney General to seek a court 
order for the extradition if it decides that the request should 
be complied with. 
  "The whole business depends on the Thai government. If the 
Thai government decides not to comply with the request, then 
there will be no extradition," Phanat said. 
  Retired Supreme Court judge Sansoen Kraichitti, also a 
member 
of the mutual legal assistance committee, said a person 
extradited under the treaty would be punished only after 
standing trial in the other country and being found guilty of 
the alleged crime. 
  Sansoen also said the Thai-U.S. extradition treaty did not 
make it compulsory for the Thai government to comply with all 
extradition requests made by the U.S. government. 
  He said those charged with drug trafficking and extradited 
under the treaty must have allegedly committed the crime after 
1991 because a provision in the Thai anti-drug law that allows 
alleged offenders to be tried in foreign courts was introduced 
in that year. 
  Chaikasem Nitisiri, deputy special prosecutor in charge of 
international legal assistance on criminal matters, said 
Thailand's Office of the Attorney General had not received a 
formal request from U.S. law enforcement officials regarding 
Thanong's extradition. 
  He ruled out the possibility of Thanong, a Chat Thai MP, 
being extradited to the United States while Parliament is in 
session. 
  "Even if we received an extradition request now, we would 
not 
be able to send Khun Thanong to the U.S. at this time, while 
Parliament is in session," Chaikasem said. 
  MPs have immunity from legal prosecution while Parliament is 
in session.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "For the Thai National Assembly's Dignity"] </F>
  [Text] The Chat Thai Party has done the right thing in 
appointing a committee to investigate the U.S. drug trafficking 
charge against one of its MP's, Thanon Siriprichaphong. Thanon 
is accused of having been involved in exporting huge quantities 
of marijuana into the United States. The US Information Service 
[USIS], the U.S. Government' mouthpiece in Thailand, has 
confirmed the seizure of the MP's property in the United States. 
  Likewise, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
has also done the right thing when he assured the U.S. 
ambassador to Thailand that the Thai Government, dutybound to 
defend Thailand's integrity and interest, will fully cooperate 
with the United States in handling the case under the country's 
legal system. 
  Earlier, several opposition leaders pointed out that the 
controversy is a political ploy to discredit the opposition Chat 
Thai Party, while many others noted that the drug charge was a 
personal affair with no effect on the House of Representatives 
or Thailand. This opinion is correct only to a certain extent. 
  Since the accused person is a member of the honorable House 
of Representatives and a public figure, his action does have 
repercussions on the institution he belongs to and on the 
country as a whole. This is a criminal case brought to court by 
a foreign government and the accused person's property has 
already been confiscated. There is no way to keep the matter 
quiet. 
  We have learned from the new USIS release that the U.S. 
Embassy notified the Thai Government about the charge on 12 
January 1993. It has been more than a year now and all senior 
figures in the government and officials concerned earlier said 
that they knew nothing about the matter. 
  The accused MP himself told mass media representatives that 
he had not received any formal charge from the United States. 
Hence, people wonder about the efficiency of Thai law 
enforcement. How can the agencies in charge of narcotics 
suppression with their close touch with the United States be 
unaware of the incident? 
  We appeal to all parties concerned, be it the government, 
House of Representative, or Chat Thai Party, to expedite the 
investigation into the charge and publicize the clear facts to 
preserve the prestige of the Thai House of Representatives and 
the good reputation of the country. Do not create a negative 
image for the country's legal system, law enforcement, and 
judicial procedure in the eyes of foreigners.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "MP's and Marijuana"] </F>
  [Text] No one should wonder about the spreading of the 
rumor on the confiscation of property in the United States of 
the MP who has been accused of exporting marijuana to that 
country. Neither is it correct to think that the whole issue is 
a scheme to discredit any political party. The very question 
that we should raise now is why the story have been kept under 
wraps for at least a year. The U.S. had attempted to get in 
touch with the accused MP through the Thai Government since 
January last year. Nothing was leaked to the general public. 
  In practice, the Thai Government, especially the agencies 
and 
ministers concerned, should expeditiously reciprocate the 
request for cooperation in the suppression of narcotics 
trafficking from any foreign government. However, this case had 
been covered up for sometime probably because it involved 
politicians and influential connections. 
  Official confirmation from the U.S. embassy about the 
seizure 
of the MP's property in the U.S. has led many to believe that 
there could be many Thai MP's engaging in the illicit business. 
A research conducted six to seven years ago also revealed that 
as many as eight MP's were involved in the marijuana trade. Up 
to this point, one will find it rather difficult to turn a blind 
eye to the drug scandal. 
  Moreover, several reports following the outbreak of the 
scandal on international drug trafficking connnections reveal 
that government officials, politicians, and local businessmen 
have been involved in exporting marijuana to the U.S. The 
government's suppression operations have so far been aimed only 
at small planters and traffickers, while the real chieftains of 
the criminal syndicates are left undisturbed to continue with 
their lucrative trade until the shameful fact is exposed by a 
foreign country. 
  Therefore, it is imperative to call on the House of 
Representatives to make serious endeavors to quickly finalize 
the investigations into the marijuana trafficking charge against 
the MP. The House of Representatives must defend its reputation. 
This is not the personal affair of the accused MP because it 
can also have negative effects on the entire legislative 
institution. Not only the House of Representatives, the Senate 
should also try to do something as a contribution and by so 
doing, more people will come to realize its significance.

  [Text] Bic Corporation of the United States has accused a 
Thai company, Thai Merry, of dumping disposable cigarette 
lighters on the US market and has asked Washington to impose 
punitive import duty of 176 percent. 
  In a petition filed on Monday with the International Trade 
Commission and the US Commerce Department Bic also asked for a 
346 percent duty on Chinese-made lighters. 
  Neither federal agency had any immediate comment. 
  "As the only remaining US manufacturer of disposable 
lighters, Bic is taking this action to protect our competitive 
position so that we can continue to provide consumers with 
made-in-the-USA quality and value," said Bic president Ray 
Winter. 
  In Bangkok, a Foreign Trade Department source said the 
department had not yet received the information about the 
dumping investigation in the United States because dumping 
involves the private sector. 
  A source from Thai Merry, the major exporter of Thai 
disposable lighters, said the company had not been informed 
about the case but believed it did not dump the products even 
though the US is the major importer of its products. 
  Thai Merry already faces an anti-dumping duty collection of 
14.1 percent on the value of lighters exported to the European 
Union after the EU Commission found that the Thai products were 
priced in a way that caused damage to local industries. 
  The EU also investigated dumping of disposable lighters from 
China and announced a duty of 16.9 percent.

  [Text] Some Thai timber merchants have resorted to 
smuggling and paying kickbacks to corrupt officials to bring 
Cambodian logs in the form of processed wood across the border 
in direct violation of UN trade sanctions against the Khmer 
Rouge [KR]. 
  The boom in timber smuggling has also financially benefited 
several police, soldiers, customs and forestry officials who man 
roadblocks from the Cambodian border to Bangkok. 
  Chat Phatthana Party MP Thanit Traiwut of Trat, in an 
interview with the BANGKOK POST at the border here yesterday, 
said Thai timber traders had invested heavily in the logging 
business in Cambodia and they had managed to bring only a small 
fraction of their timber out of Cambodia before the March 31 
deadline expired. 
  "A large quantity of logs remain in Cambodia. So local 
businessmen have to resort to smuggling to recoup their 
investment otherwise the logs will be left to rot," said the MP, 
who said he quit the timber business only three months ago. 
  Tens of thousands of felled logs have been left in Khmer 
Rouge- controlled territory in the Samraong area in Battambang 
alone, according to Lok Nong, a Khmer Rouge cadre in Samrod. 
  One of the main problems discouraging Thai timber merchants 
from engaging in straight and legal dealings with Phnom Penh is 
the issuance of a new regulation requiring a Certificate of 
Origin to export Cambodian timber. 
  Mr Thanit explained that to obtain the CO is a complicated 
process and also involves under-the-table money payments. A 
normal fee of US$35 is charged for a cubic metre of timber to be 
exported, but merchants sometimes have to pay up to US$60 if all 
the expenses to obtain a CO are added up. 
  "With the CO, the Thai merchant must notify the Thai customs 
which will then pass on the document to the Finance Ministry, 
the Foreign Ministry the Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh, the 
Cambodian Foreign Ministry and finally to the Forestry 
Department of Cambodia which has to verify the CO," said Mr 
Thanit. 
  "The whole process may take up to three months and, by that 
time, the CO's term has almost expired and a new CO would have 
to be obtained." 
  But even with the CO being verified the merchants will still 
have to pay taxes to the Khmer Rouge guerrillas because the logs 
are in guerrilla-controlled territories, said another timber 
merchant. 
  "That means merchants will pay twice for each lot of timber 
to the Phnom Penh government and to the Khmer Rouge," he said. 
  But the money and trouble saved by not obtaining the CO from 
Phnom Penh the merchants have to hand out in bribes to a host of 
Thai officials, namely the police, troops, customs and forestry 
officials, who man the various roadblocks along the roads 
leading from the Cambodian border to the sawmills in Thailand. 
The longer the trip for each truckload of timber, the higher 
the payment in bribes. 
  "Sometimes, a temporary roadblock just pops up with the 
officials demanding money for convenient passage in addition to 
the permanent checkpoints," said the merchant who declined to be 
named. 
  The timber merchant claimed he had to pay at least 50,000 
baht to all the checkpoints for each truckload of processed wood. 
  "We have to make arrangements with all the officials 
involved 
otherwise there will be problems," he said, adding that if this 
is not done in advance, the timber will run the risk of being 
impounded as contraband. 
  And in that case, he said, some merchants had to pay as much 
as 300,000 baht "ransom" under the table to get back the truck 
as well as the cargo. 
  Despite the small amount of royalties levied by Phnom Penh 
for the timber export, most timber merchants said they still 
prefer smuggling because they have to move the logs across the 
border as fast as possible otherwise they will rot. 
  According to Mr Thanit, no less than 100 timber-laden trucks 
have been seized by officials for overloading and smuggling. 
  The Chat Phatthana MP said he had received complaints from 
many merchants about the alleged extortion. 
  But despite the "extortion" from the authorities, several 
merchants have sought -- and made--deals with the Khmer Rouge. 
  "We care very much about the honesty and safety of the Thai 
merchants who invested their money in our territories,' Lok Nong 
told the Bangkok Post. 
  He said he felt more comfortable dealing with Thai merchants 
than with European, Singaporean or Japanese traders. 
  Lok Nong claimed that only 20 per cent of forests in 
Cambodia 
were cut. He said the committee had set some rules about 
logging and only mature trees are to be felled. 
  He admitted that logging and gem mining were still the two 
major sources of income for the Khmer Rouge. He complained that 
after the UN-monitored general elections in Cambodia supplies to 
the guerrillas had been cut off. 
  He gave his personal assurance to Thai loggers that felled 
trees in guerrilla-controlled territory would not be lost.

  [Text] An agreement on a bilateral tourism cooperation 
plan between the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] and the 
Tourism Authority of Thailand [TAT] was signed at the Sheraton 
Grand Laguna Beach Resort Hotel in Phukhet Province yesterday. 
  Regarding the cooperation plan, TAT Governor Thammanun 
Prachuapmo said that it will deal mostly with what Thailand will 
give to Laos, especially in the area of cooperation to prevent 
adverse affects from tourism -- which Thailand has experienced 
-- from occuring in Laos. 
  Phonsouk Khounasombat, director of the National Tourism 
Organization of the LPDR, reported that tourism in Laos has 
gradually expanded since the time the country introduced an open 
door policy to tourism in 1989. In the process, more 
conveniences have been provided for tourists. In particular, 
laws and rules and regulations have been revised to benefit 
visitors more than before. Four more international border 
checkpoints have been opened. They are the checkpoints 
bordering China in Bokeo and Boten; the Souvan checkpoint 
linking Thailand's Mukdahan Province; and the Savannakhet border 
checkpoint linking Vietnam. Moreover, new regulations have been 
made to make it possible for tourists to receive visas either at 
the airport or at an international border checkpoint.

  [Excerpt] The Thailand Business Council for Sustainable 
Development, comprising 50 leading company members, has 
initiated five projects aimed at protecting and saving the 
country's environment. 
  The council was established six months ago to address 
environmental issues and is chaired by former Prime Minister 
Anan Panyarachun. 
  The five projects are: pesticide-free agricultural villages, 
renovation of Khlong Lot, study of lignite and its impact on the 
environment, environmental conservation circle (ECC), and green 
labelling. 
  The council's objectives are: to provide reliable 
information and guidance to distinguish genuine 
environment-friendly products; to encourage the production of 
green products using clean technologies; to promote energy 
conservation and recycling; to promote the establishment of a 
third-party labeller who can offer an unbiased opinion to back 
up marketing claims, to establish more demanding standards for 
companies to make environmentally sound products; and to promote 
environmental awareness among manufacturers and consumers. 
  Chaiyot Bunyakitdi, director of the Thailand Environment 
Institute's business and environment programme, said the green 
labelling project will be significant in helping identify 
projects that have proven to be less destructive to the 
environment. To date, 19 member firms have agreed to 
participate in the labelling project. 
  Environment-friendly products have achieved international 
popularity among environment-conscious consumers. 
  Mr Chaiyot said the council will vigorously promote this 
project and hopes to establish guidelines to assist firms in 
their marketing claims, often not entirely accurate, of products 
less damaging to the environment. 
  The Thailand Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(TBCSD) has proposed establishing a committee, to be chaired by 
Permanent Secretary for Industry Siwawong Changkhasiri, on green 
labelling guidelines and comprising representatives from the 
Federation of Thai Industries, Board of Trade, Thai Industrial 
Standards Institute, Office of Consumer Protection, 
Environmental Engineering Association of Thailand, Press 
Association, Public Relations Confederation of Thailand, 
Marketing Association of Thailand and no more than 25 
representatives from TBCSD. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A 22-member delegation led by Yunnan Governor He 
Zhiqiang arrived in Bangkok from Phnom Penh yesterday for a 
6-day observation tour of Thailand. The visit is aimed at 
promoting trade, investment, and tourism cooperation between 
Yunnan and Thailand. 
  The delegation includes Kunming City Mayor Wang Yanchen and 
15 businessmen. They are scheduled to call on Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai today and to hold talks with Commerce minister 
Uthai Phimchaichon, Interior Minister General Chawalit 
Yongchaiyut, and senior industry and communications officials 
during their visit. He Zhiqiang and his delegation will also 
preside over an investment seminar and visit the Stock Exchange 
of Thailand and trade complexes. 
  At present, Yunnan Province's foreign trade is mainly 
conducted through its border with Burma, Vietnam, and Laos. The 
Yunnan governor's visit to Thailand and Cambodia is aimed at 
expanding and strengthening trade cooperation and learning about 
the investment atmosphere of these countries. 
  Yunnan Province has joined Thailand, Burma, and Laos in 
carrying out the quadrangle economic cooperation zone project. 
It plans to build a railway and two highways, through Burma or 
Laos, to Thailand to connect other highways which link with 
other ASEAN countries. 
  He Zhiqiang will conclude his visit to Thailand next Monday 
and will continue his trip to Burma for a similar observation 
tour. He has recently visited Vietnam and Laos. 
  In 1993, Yunnan's border trade with neighboring countries 
was 
287.3 billion yuan, of which 88 percent was recorded with Burma, 
10 percent with Vietnam, and 2 percent with Laos.

  [Text] Khun Sa has mobilized his forces to encircle 
Burmese Government troops and is trying to recapture Chot Town. 
In the ensuing battle four Khun Sa soldiers were killed, at 
least 15 Burmese soldiers were believed killed, and there were 
many casualties. The latest report says that Khun Sa's men have 
succeeded in recapturing five bases. 
  Shan State, 11 May -- Four days ago Burmese Government 
forces 
attacked a Khun Sa stronghold and captured seven military bases 
on Doi Hinpong, opposite Thailand's Wiang Haeng District, Chiang 
Mai province. On the day of the loss of the bases, the Khun Sa 
troops encircled the Burmese soldiers in the captured bases, 
triggering heavy fighting along the Thai-Burmese border opposite 
Thailand's Ban Piang Luang, Wiang Haeng District. 
  A report says the 250-strong Khun Sa force attacked the 
Burmese Government force in the bases on Doi Hinpong in Chot 
Town, about 20 km from the Thai border and recaptured five of 
the bases. 
  A report on the fighting by the Thai Task Force 327 in Wiang 
Haeng District said four Khun Sa soldiers were killed and many 
wounded. Some of the wounded were taken for treatement to a 
hospital in Ban Maisung, a Khun Sa liberated area. Some were 
sent to the district hospital in Wiang Haeng District. The 
casualties on the Burmese Government side were estimated at no 
less than 15 killed. 
  According to Prince Khunduan Saengkham, the secretary 
general 
of the Shan State restoration council, the Khun Sa soldiers have 
been deployed in Tuan and Chang Towns and have completely 
encircled Chot Town. An attack on the Burmese Government 
soldiers was expected soon. 
  The prince said: "We have hired about 20 small buses in Ban 
Piang Luang to transport soldiers to reinforce the front line 
and move the wounded soldiers to the district hospital in Wiang 
Haeng District."

despite a threat from the Communist Party of the Philippines-New 
People's Army-National Democratic Front to pull out of the peace 
talks. According to Malacanang [presidential office], there were 
legal grounds for Tiamzon's arrest and the law must be followed. 
Malacanang reiterated that it will not be blackmailed; it will 
not release Tiamzon just because the rebels threaten to pull out 
of the peace talks. 
  Alexander Aguirre, acting secretary of the Department of 
Interior and Local Government, said there are two arrest 
warrants for Tiamzon involving kidnapping cases: 
  [Begin Aguirre recording in progress, in English] ...more on 
kidnapping with serious illegal detention. So certainly we are 
abiding with due process. We are also seeing to it that she is

  [Text] [Acting] Secretary Aguirre [of Department of 
Interior and Local Government] says the Philippine Government 
will continue to go after communist rebels who have standing 
warrants of arrest. Aguirre made this statement as he defended 
the National Police's continued detention of CPP-NPA [Communist 
Party of the Philippines-New People's Army] Secretary General 
Wilma Tiamzon and four others. He cited cases of kidnapping 
with serious illegal detention, robbery and other 
rebellion-related offenses as their bases for holding the five 
under custody. Aguirre also stressed that the arrest did not 
adversely affect the peace process, since the Philippine 
Government has not entered into any agreement to suspend any 
arrest, hear cases or surveillance activities with the National 
Democratic Front. 
  In a related development, doctors of Tiamzon are urging 
President Ramos to order her release from detention on medical 
and humanitarian grounds. The doctors examined Tiamzon, Tuesday 
morning, and recommended her immediate hospitalization. They 
said Tiamzon is suffering from severe uncontrolled hypertension, 
chronic infection of the kidney, kidney hemorrhage and bronchial 
asthma. They urged the president to have her transferred to the 
Philippine Heart Center where she can get immediate and constant 
medical attention.

<F P=106> [By Sandra S. Aguinaldo] </F>
  [Text] The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) has 
deactivated 25 companies of the controversial Citizen's Armed 
Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) for the first quarter of this 
year as a result of the continuing decline in strength of 
different rebel and terrorist groups. 
  According to a military report obtained by BUSINESS WORLD, 
CAFGU strength has been cut to 65,836 from the 67,691 militiamen 
in the beginning of 1994. 
  The AFP said the dismantling of the units, composed of 
civilians trained by the military to assist in the fight against 
communist rebels in the countryside, was another proof they are 
consistently gaining the upper hand in military offensives. 
  The CAFGU's have been tagged as notorious human rights 
violators, prompting several Congressmen to last year file a 
resolution for inquiry on the former's performance and abuses. 
[sentence as published] Several units were identified in the 
past as serving known politicians, businessmen and landlords in 
the provinces, even as complaints were received by various 
cause-oriented groups. 
  However, the AFP said that during the latter part of last 
year, it had moved for the improvement in the training and 
motivation of CAFGU volunteers in order to prevent similar 
incidents. 
  The AFP, in fact, said it had received no reports of human 
rights violations committed by soldiers and militiamen this 
year. Sources at Camp Aguinaldo said the decline can be 
attributed to the easing up of the situation in the countryside 
plus the training and education. 
  For 1994, militiamen were instructed to provide security in 
areas cleared by the AFP and the Philippine National Police 
(PNP) and to limit the conduct of combat operations. 
  At present, there are 956 CAFGU companies with a total 
strength of 65,836 deployed in 9,249 barangays [village] 
nationwide. More units are scheduled to be deactivated in the 
coming years under a plan that aims to reduce CAFGU's to zero 
before 1999. 
  The same report said the decline of the threat from the 
Communist Party of the Philippines and the objective of 
transferring the counter-insurgency responsibility to the PNP 
next year should further enhance the good performance of CAFGU's 
for the remaining months of this year.

  [Text] Jala-Jala, Rizal -- President Ramos yesterday said 
government has licked the insurgency problem, not through 
military warfare but through economic development. 
  Inaugurating a P [Philippine pesos] 4.5 billion rural 
development project funded by the Japanese government here, he 
cited this farming-fishing town as an example of how to turn a 
rebel- dominated area into a "vibrant, bustling community." 
  "Tapos na `yung problema na 'yon, nasugpo na natin `yon (We 
have overcome that problem)," the president declared, referring 
to the communist insurgency. 
  In the case of Jala-jala, he said, the government won not 
through the military solution but by providing livelihood 
programs and job opportunities to the people. 
  Mr. Ramos, a former Armed Forces chief of staff and later 
defense secretary, recalled that this area used to be 
"strategic" to the New People's Army. 
  He said this town by Laguna Lake was often used as a 
jump-off 
point because several key areas and provinces are easily 
accessible from here. 
  Having been once stationed in the area as a junior military 
officer, the president added he had seen how the Huk [anti- 
government rebel group] and later NPA [New People's Army] 
campaigns had turned the area into a "no man's land." 
  He also said this town had been isolated for so long from 
the 
rest of Rizal province and Metro Manila because of lack of 
concrete roads and infrastructure. 
  "But now, you're no longer isolated here," he told farmers 
and fisher folk in a speech at the newly completed rice 
processing complex. 
  The president said the rural development project, now on the 
second phase of implementation, has helped made this possible. 
  Funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, 
(JICA), 
the project comprises a rice processing complex, irrigation, 
water and power supply systems, and trunk and feeder roads. 
  Construction began early last year and is expected to be 
completed March 1995. Yesterday's ceremonies involved the 
turnover of some of the completed facilities and equipment. 
  Agrarian Reform Secretary Ernesto Garilao said Jala-jala has 
also become a "model agrarian reform community" through the land 
distribution component of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform 
Program (CARP). 
  "The problem of skewed land ownership, which is the reason 
for rebellion in the area, has been addressed," he said. 
  From having nine landowners, he said, Jala-jala has been 
transformed into a town of 2,000 farmer-landowners. 
  For his part, Japanese Ambassador Yoshifumi Matsuda [name 
and 
title as published] said his government intends to give priority 
to CARP projects in extending more economic aid in the future. 
  In brief remarks during the turnover rights, he said his 
government believes CARP should be implemented "as fast as 
possible."

  [Text] Three thousand winning candidates in the recently 
concluded village elections have already been proclaimed by the 
Comelec [Commission on Elections]. These were registered by the 
Comelec as part of the first batch of winning candidates. They 
represent more than 300 of the 41,000 villages in the whole 
archipelago where elections were held. The proclaimed 
candidates include those from the southern Philippines, the 
Visayan islands, and the National Capital Region [Metro Manila]. 
On the other hand, the Comelec is suspending the proclamation 
of 66 candidates due to election code violations.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japanese Trade Minister 
Eijiro Hata and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale on 
Thursday [12 May] agreed that Japan and the United States will 
try to resume the stalled trade "framework" talks at an early 
time, a ministry official said. 
  The accord was reached when Mondale paid a courtesy call on 
Hata, chief of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI), at the latter's office for the first time since the 
cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed in late April. 
  Neither Mondale nor Hata, however, made reference to 
specific 
issues of the framework talks, the official told reporters. 
Hata and Mondale agreed to have continued dialogue for an early 
breakthrough in the talks, the official said. 
  The talks on a proposed new framework for bilateral trade 
broke down in February at the summit of then Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale agreed 
Thursday [12 May] that the two nations will try to resume the 
bilateral trade talks prior to the July summit of industrialized 
countries, a ministry official said. The accord on the stalled 
trade "framework" talks was reached when Mondale paid a courtesy 
call on Kakizawa at the Foreign Ministry for the first time 
since the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed in

  Kakizawa was quoted as saying there will be opportunities 
for 
the two nations to have trade talks prior to the summit meeting 
of Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations to be held in 
early July in Naples. 
  Mondale said he has similar views on holding the trade 
talks, 
according to the official. 
  Kakizawa expressed his hope to visit the United States soon. 
He did not mention the timing of the visit, noting he has a 
series of debates in the Diet to attend, the official said. 
  Mondale met Minister of International Trade and Industry 
Eijiro Hata earlier in the day and they exchanged similar views 
on the need to resume the trade talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Thursday [12 May] he wants to see Japanese and U.S. trade 
officials return to the negotiating table for the deadlocked 
framework trade talks before the July summit meeting of the 
Group of Seven major industrial countries. 
  Hata said at a plenary session of the House of 
Representatives that negotiations in specific areas should be 
resumed before the summit, adding his government will seize 
every opportunity to reopen the bilateral talks, foundered in 
February. But Hata reiterated Japan cannot accept numerical 
targets to measure market access improvement, saying setting 
such targets runs counter to Japan's basic stance on trade. 
  Bilateral trade relations soured after former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed at 
their meeting in February to reach a trade pact under a 
bilateral framework agreement in July 1993. 
  The talks broke down after Japan rejected a U.S. demand for 
numerical targets to gauge progress in such areas as the auto, 
insurance, medical equipment and telecommunications markets. 
  Hata said his government plans to pursue bold economic 
reforms, focused on deregulations and domestic demand-led growth 
to solve the bilateral dispute over Japan's huge trade surplus 
with the United States. 
  On current economic conditions, Hata said the domestic 
economy remains by and large in a slump despite some bright 
signs. 
  While pointing to a brisk housing sector and a slight 
recovery in consumer spending, he admitted corporate capital 
investments continue to decline, and the labor market is weak 
with prospects for corporate earnings still bleak. He said the 
government will make every effort to put the economy back on a 
firm footing "as early as possible in fiscal 1994." 
  The government will place a high priority on securing a 
stable labor market and on sustainable economic growth propelled 
by expansion of domestic demand, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japan should pursue a 
breakthrough in the stalled trade "framework" talks with 
Washington by focusing on "objective criteria," Yotaro 
Kobayashi, chairman of the Japan-U.S. Business Council, said 
Thursday [12 May]. "There is something that Japan can and 
should do (on objective criteria)," Kobayashi told a luncheon 
sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. 
  Kobayashi said objective criteria are concepts that Tokyo 
and 
Washington previously agreed to work on in their efforts to 
establish a new bilateral trade framework. 
  It is not "a difficult task" to evaluate American access to 
Japanese markets by using certain criteria that describe a "so- 
called desired state" in certain trade sectors, said Kobayashi, 
who is also chairman of Fuji Xerox Co. 
  Such criteria, first spelled out in a joint statement issued 
after the July 1993 summit between then Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton, differ from "numerical 
targets," which Tokyo has opposed as managed trade, Kobayashi 
said. 
  "I am sure both governments can agree to the use of `desired 
state.' It does not have to be stated in specific numbers or 
market share figures, but it can be stated in mutually agreed 
terms like visibly reducing the current account surplus," 
Kobayashi said. 
  If sales of certain U.S. products in Japan stay flat in the 
future despite Tokyo's purchasing pledge, discussions to improve 
the situation can then be held, he said. 
  The statement from the Miyazawa-Clinton summit indicated the 
two countries will "assess the implementation of measures and 
policies taken in each sectoral and structural area... [ellipses 
as received] based upon sets of objective criteria, either 
qualitative or quantitative or both as appropriate." 
  Kobayashi said the perception that the U.S. demands 
numerical 
targets is wrong. Clinton "clearly and unequivocally" stated 
Washington does not want such targets, in a joint news 
conference after meeting with then Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa in February, Kobayashi said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
denied Thursday [12 May] that Japan had secretly agreed with the 
United States in 1969 to allow Washington to deploy nuclear arms 
on Okinawa island to defend Japan and America's other Asian 
allies in times of emergency. 
  "Although former Prime Minister (Eisaku) Sato and U.S. 
President (Richard) Nixon were recently alleged to have signed 
the secret agreement, such a pact does not in fact exist," Hata 
told the House of Representatives plenary session. 
  "My government will firmly continue to live up to Japan's 
three antinuclear principles," Hata said in response to Tomiichi 
Murayama, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, 
SDPJ], the nation's No. 2 opposition party. The three 
principles bar Japan from manufacturing and authorizing foreign 
nations to bring to or store nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. 
  Hata was referring to a recent allegation in a book authored 
by Kei Wakaizumi, a former special emissary of Sato, in 
negotiations with the Nixon administration, that led up to a 
1969 accord to return then U.S.-held Okinawa to Japanese 
sovereignty without the presence of nuclear weapons there. 
  Wakaizumi, a former Defense Agency researcher, alleged Sato 
and Nixon signed the top-secret memorandum at the White House on 
November 21, 1969. The memorandum says Japan is aware of U.S. 
expectations for a favorable response to possible U.S. requests 
to deploy nuclear weapons on Okinawa in times of a contingency. 
  Wakaizumi, who negotiated with then National Security 
Adviser 
Henry Kissinger on behalf of Sato who sought Okinawa's return 
without nuclear arms, quoted Sato as saying, "Because Mr. Nixon 
signed (the memorandum) with his full name, I also signed it 
with my full name." 
  The former lecturer at the Johns Hopkins University said 
Sato 
demanded that the signing be shrouded in secrecy for fear of 
angering Japanese media people, many of whom were then balking 
at the Japan-U.S. security treaty. 
  Murayama told the Diet, "Then the special envoy of Prime 
Minister Sato exposed the secret agreement that authorizes the 
United States to deploy nuclear weapons in times of a 
contingency, which was inked after the announcement of the 
Japan-U.S. communique in November 1969." 
  Hata issued his denial after the SDP leader rapped the 
government for allowing the presence of U.S. military bases in 
Okinawa by referring to the recent crash of two F-15 U.S. jet 
fighters, which Murayama said pained Okinawan residents. 
  Hata also spurned Murayama's demand to immediately resume 
negotiations with North Korea to establish diplomatic ties with 
Pyongyang. "Japan will never normalize its relations with North 
Korea unless the country clears up international suspicions over 
its suspected nuclear weapons program," the premier said. 
  He urged Pyongyang to comply with the U.N. Security Council 
presidential statement, which called for North Korea to allow 
the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct unimpeded 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  On a related topic, Hata also said Japan's Constitution 
prohibits the country's involvement in collective security, 
brushing aside concerns that his government may move toward 
active military actions overseas. 
  "I think collective security is beyond the boundary of the 
Constitution, and it is in practice not permitted," he said. "I 
have no intention to change" the conventional interpretation of 
the Constitution by the postwar Japanese Government on the 
issue, he said. 
  He was responding to a query by Yohei Kono, president of the 
Liberal Democratic Party, the No. 1 opposition party. 
  Although Japan has the right for collective security in 
terms 
of international law, Hata argued the war-denouncing 
Constitution only grants Japan the "minimum necessary" rights 
for self-defense. 
  Hata also displayed a cautious stance toward the proposed 
legislation to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula. 
The issue requires a "highly political judgment" and "should be 
considered cautiously," he said. 
  The remark is an apparent effort to distance himself from 
some key cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa, who recently called for early steps toward legislation 
for dealing with international emergencies, such as the crisis 
over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  However, in a reply to Murayama's similar question, Hata 
said, "The government is now considering such legislation to 
eliminate any ambiguities (concerning a response to a 
contingency) as it should appeal to the public to endorse it 
when necessary."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Posts and Telecommunications 
Minister Katsuyuki Hikasa and a U.S. leader of the "information 
superhighway" project agreed Thursday [12 May] to cooperate in 
the construction of an optical-fiber global information network, 
ministry officials said. Hikasa met with Edward McCracken, 
cochairman of the U.S. National Information Infrastructure (NII) 
Council, who is visiting Tokyo. 
  Japan is preparing to build an optical-fiber network for 
domestic communications, and is calling for a wider network 
joined by South Korea and other Asian nations. 
  The ministry officials said Hikasa told McCracken that Japan 
will back the Global Information Infrastructure (GII) project 
which is being promoted by the United States. 
  The GII plan was proposed by U.S. Vice President Al Gore in 
March. It aims to provide instant access to information around 
the world through a large optical-fiber communication network.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Thursday [12 May] it is "still too early" for the Group of 
Seven (G-7) member industrialized countries to grant full 
membership to Russia. Hata told reporters Japan favors the 
present formula of "G-7 plus one" postsummit dialogue with 
Russia. 
  His comment was in response to reports from Moscow that 
President Boris Yeltsin wants to make Russia an eighth member of 
the group, which consists of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, 
Italy, Japan and the United States. 
  Hata said Russia is still a recipient of economic and 
financial aid but its political influence is undeniably strong 
as in the case of the military conflict in the former Yugoslavia. 
  A high-ranking Foreign Ministry official, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, noted that many members of the G-7 
countries, at a recent meeting of G-7 government 
representatives, were against Russia's participation in the 
dialogue as a regular member. 
  A senior Finance Ministry official also said, "It is 
difficult for both donors and a recipient nation like Russia to 
sit at the same table."

  The official was responding to a news report that said 
President Boris Yeltsin hoped Russia will be allowed to join the 
G-7 group of industrialized nations. He made the remarks at a 
news conference with [the] German chancellor in Bonn. 
  "Japan expects Russia to play a big role in resolving the 
Bosnia issue. Yeltsin seems to be pandering to domestic 
considerations in trying to show that Russia is a strong country 
and a big power," the finance official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japan and other leading 
industrial nations are cooperating on credit policy but not 
simply to prop up the dollar, a top Finance Ministry official 
said Thursday [12 May]. 
  Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a regular news 
conference that the Group of Seven (G-7) nations agree on 
promoting "stable economic growth without inflation" and that 
Japan is cooperating as a G-7 member. But he said each country 
is making its own policy to further that goal and they "are not 
necessarily (cooperating) for the sake of foreign exchange 
alone." 
  Reports have surfaced in recent days that Japan, the United 
States, Germany and other major nations are acting together on 
interest rates, in addition to recent concerted central bank 
interventions in the currency markets to boost the dollar. 
  Germany's Bundesbank on Wednesday cut two key rates by 0.5 
percentage point each, with other European central banks 
following suit. The Bank of Japan has been guiding market rates 
to record lows through generous liquidity funding operations. 
  On the other hand, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely 
expected to raise rates again Tuesday. Higher rates in the 
recovering U.S. economy and lower rates in the other 
still-sluggish economies are expected to boost the dollar, which 
bounced back from near-record lows around 100 yen after the 
market interventions of the past two weeks. 
  Saito said the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan do not 
differ on monetary policy. Central bank chief Yasushi Mieno 
said Wednesday he intends to keep rates low.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Japanese Trade Minister 
Eijiro Hata on Thursday [13 May] pledged that Tokyo would make 
efforts to deepen its ties with China. Japan should do its 
utmost to make its ties with China "fruitful" while reflecting 
on the recent controversial remark by a Japanese cabinet 
minister, International Trade and Industry Minister Hata told a 
Chinese economic delegation. 
  Hata received a courtesy call at his office from Ye Qing, 
vice minister of the Chinese State Planning Commission. 
  Qing heads an eight-member team currently visiting Japan to 
hold subcabinet-level consultations Thursday and Friday with a 
Japanese delegation led by Hideaki Kumano, vice international 
trade and industry minister. 
  Hata was referring to last week's remark by the justice 
minister denying that the 1937 Nanjing massacre by Japanese 
troops ever took place.

  [Text] Matsue, May 12 KYODO -- Fourteen out of 94 
foreigners, most of whom are apparently Chinese, were arrested 
after arriving illegally in Japan aboard a freighter, police 
said Thursday [12 May]. About 50 passengers apparently remain 
aboard the vessel registered in Honduras, while some 30 who went 
ashore are missing, they said. 
  A fishing boat discovered the vessel entangled in fishing 
net 
in the Sea of Japan, four kilometers off Taki, Shimane 
Prefecture, early Thursday and informed police, they said. 
  Investigators arrested 13 men in Taki, as well as a 
Japanese-speaking man aboard the vessel, on suspicion of 
violating the Immigration Control and Refugee Recognition Act, 
police said. The 13 were apparently crew members and had either 
Indonesian or Philippine passports, they said. 
  A 46-year-old Indonesian man who claimed to be the captain 
was quoted as saying the ship left Guangzhou in the Chinese 
southeastern province of Guangdong on April 19 with 13 crew 
members and 81 passengers, including six women, they said. 
  The man told investigators the freighter was caught in net 
Wednesday and sent about 30 passengers, including the women, to 
shore by a small boat early Thursday morning, police said. 
  A 22-year-old detained passenger reportedly said he was 
bound 
for Tokyo and paid 60,000 yuan (about 750,000 yen) as a 
guarantee for smuggling into Japan and was to pay another 
110,000 yuan (about 1.38 million yen) if the attempt succeeded. 
  The Maritime Safety Agency will take the freighter to port 
for investigation, they said. 
  According to the Justice Ministry, some 2,300 foreigners 
illegally entered Japan in 1989 and 1990, and about 1,660 in 
1991. The figure stood at 3,460 in 1992 and 5,000 in 1993, with 
the numbers from China and Vietnam increasing recently, 
officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Dentsu Inc. said Thursday 
[12 May] it will establish an advertisement company in China 
jointly with two local firms. 
  The new firm, called Beijing Dentsu Advertising Co., will be 
capitalized at 2 million dollars. 
  Dentsu will hold a 51 percent equity share, while the rest 
will be held by China International Advertising Corp. and Da 
Cheng Advertising Ltd. 
  The Chinese advertising market reached roughly 200 billion 
yen in 1993 in turnover. Dentsu estimates the market will grow 
10 to 20 percent annually. 
  The Japanese advertising agency entered China in 1986 under 
a 
joint venture arrangement with Young and Rubicam Inc. of the 
United States. Dentsu also has branch offices in Beijing and 
Shanghai.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
said Thursday [12 May] Japan's Constitution prohibits the 
country's involvement in collective security, brushing aside 
concerns that his government may move toward active military 
actions overseas. Hata said at a plenary session of the House 
of Representatives, "I think collective security is beyond the 
boundary of the Constitution, and it is in practice not 
permitted." 
  "I have no intention to change" the conventional 
interpretation of the Constitution by the postwar Japanese 
Government on the issue, he said. He was responding to a query 
by Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party, the 
No. 1 opposition party. 
  Hata's remarks were apparently designed to dodge criticism 
and ease apprehension among opposition lawmakers that his 
cabinet is moving toward more active involvement by Japan's 
Self-Defense Forces in international conflicts. 
  Although Japan, as a sovereign nation, has rights for 
collective security in terms of international law, Hata argued 
the war-denouncing Constitution only grants Japan the "minimum 
necessary" rights for self-defense. 
  Hata also displayed a cautious stance toward the proposed 
legislation to deal with international crises. The issue 
requires a "highly political judgment" and "should be considered 
cautiously," he said. 
  The statement is an apparent effort to distance himself from 
some key cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa, who recently called for early steps toward legislation 
for dealing with international emergencies, such as the crisis 
over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  Hata noted the importance of diplomatic efforts to solve the 
North Korea nuclear issue, while adding Japan should cooperate 
with any UN Security Council actions "within the framework of 
the Constitution." 
  On the question of alleged financial impropriety by his 
predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata tried to avoid any 
commitment to further action. 
  Calling it Hosokawa's "private problems," Hata suggested he 
is reluctant to consent to opposition calls for the former 
premier's Diet testimony over corruption charges that toppled 
him from office last month. 
  Hata also tried to heal the emotional wounds caused by 
former 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's recent remarks over Japan's 
role in World War II. He said the outcry by Japan's Asian 
neighbors over the remarks "renewed his acknowledgement that 
Japan's aggressive actions and colonial rule (during the war) 
inflicted unbearable pain and sorrow on some Asian people." 
  Nagano, who said the so-called Nanjing massacre was a 
"fabrication" and denied Japan waged an aggressive war on Asian 
nations, resigned last Saturday amid a diplomatic controversy 
over his remarks. Hata said he handled the problem without 
delay, and has sought and obtained "understanding" from 
infuriated Asian countries. 
  In an interview published May 4 in the mass-circulation 
daily 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Nagano said, "the Nanjing incident was a 
fabrication." "I think it is wrong to define the war as a war 
of aggression (by Japan)...still, I doubt the Greater East Asia 
War, as it was called in Japan, was aimed at aggression." 
  Nagano, 71, a former chief of staff of the Ground 
Self-Defense Force, resigned Saturday after serving for only 10 
days as justice minister. He was succeeded by Hiroshi Nakai.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- The chairman of the Japan 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) said Thursday the next 
general election for the House of Representatives may have to be 
held under the existing electoral system based on multiseat 
constituencies. 
  Kosaku Inaba told reporters that an election under the 
current system is a possibility, although it should preferably 
be held after the introduction of a new system combining 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. 
  Top leaders of other major Japanese business organizations, 
including the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), 
have said the lower house should be dissolved for a general 
election only after a new electoral system is introduced.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- New Party Sakigake 
[Harbinger] leader Masayoshi Takemura on Thursday [12 May] 
backed a call from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) for the 
next general election to be held under the current multiseat 
constituency system, Sakigake officials said. 
  "It is a reasonable idea," Takemura was quoted as saying of 
the proposal in a meeting with SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama. 
  Both Sakigake and the SDP quit the ruling coalition last 
month, leaving the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to be 
a minority government. Sakigake has offered cooperation for the 
Hata cabinet without occupying any post in it, while the SDP has 
declared it is an opposition party. 
  Murayama urged Hata on Wednesday to dissolve the House of 
Representatives and call a snap general election under the 
current election system. Murayama told the Sakigake leader that 
the premier's authority to dissolve the lower house should not 
be restricted just because the Diet has not yet passed a bill 
for redistributing multiple-seat constituencies into single-seat 
electoral districts, the officials said. 
  The Diet in January passed the new electoral system revision 
bill to replace the multiseat system with a mix of 300 single 
seats and 200 seats under proportional representation. But a 
separate bill has to be passed to reorganize the single-seat 
constituencies before an election can be held under the new 
system. 
  The meeting between Takemura and Murayama took place in the 
SDP headquarters. They also met Wednesday at the Sakigake 
headquarters. 
  The two leaders also agreed to initiate talks aimed at 
reconciling their policy and ideological differences as a 
prerequisite for cementing their solidarity and parliamentary 
tactical collaboration, the officials said. 
  One of the key differences is over the Japan-U.S. Security 
Treaty, opposed by some SDP members but supported by Sakigake, 
which was set up by a breakaway group of Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) legislators.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
proposed Thursday [12 May] holding summit talks with leaders of 
the country's two largest political parties, the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 
which are both in the opposition camp, government officials said. 
  Hata, who heads a minority government, hopes to seek 
cooperation from the opposition in an early passage of the 
already overdue fiscal 1994 budget and other Diet business, the 
officials said. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai conveyed Hata's 
proposal for talks with LDP President Yohei Kono during a 
telephone conversation with LDP secretary general Yoshiro Mori. 
  Kumagai also made the similar request during a meeting with 
SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo. Hata hopes to hold the talks 
by early next week, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of the 
No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party, appealed to Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata on Thursday [12 May] to agree to a meeting 
with him next Tuesday. 
  However, Kono said he has not yet finalized possible topics 
for discussion with the premier. "I will consider what the 
contents of the meeting should be," he said. 
  Hata, in his first policy speech to the House of 
Representatives on Tuesday, appealed to opposition parties to 
cooperate to help his fragile minority government steer Japan 
through difficult times on both domestic and international 
fronts. 
  But Kono, in his parliamentary interpellation on Thursday, 
questioned the authority of the minority government and 
expressed readiness to take over power from the Hata 
administration. 
  Kono has also arranged a meeting with Tomiichi Murayama, 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ], on 
Monday, a day before his planned talks with Prime Minister Hata, 
according to other LDP sources. 
  The Kono-Murayama meeting marks the first between an LDP 
president and an SDP chairman since the LDP was ousted from 
power last summer, party officials said. 
  Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai told 
reporters both Kono and Murayama have agreed to hold separate 
meetings next Tuesday with Hata, who is also leader of Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party). 
  Kumagai said Hata may also seek similar dialogue with 
leaders 
of other parties, including new party Sakigake [Harbinger].

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- The chief of former 
coalition bloc new party Sakigake (Harbinger) said Thursday [12 
May] there would be a change of power after enactment of the 
fiscal 1994 state budget, indicating the administration of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata will be short-lived. Masayoshi Takemura 
said Hata's minority administration is not in "good shape" and 
defined it as a government that takes charge of "certain things" 
for a "certain period." 
  Takemura made the remarks in a campaign speech in front of 
the Shimbashi Railway Station in central Tokyo. He was joined 
by eight of the party's 15 House of Representatives lawmakers 
who also gave speeches. 
  Sakigake, previously a small body in the seven-party 
coalition of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, left the 
coalition last month during the process of picking Hata as 
Hosokawa's successor, complaining of the coalition's way of 
selecting a new leader. Departure of the leading coalition 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ] put the Hata 
administration on a minority power base. 
  Political analysts predicted that the Hata cabinet will be 
forced to resign en masse or call a snap election of the 
powerful lower house as early as June after the Diet legislates 
the state budget for the current fiscal year that began April 1.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Idemitsu Kosan Co. and seven 
other Japanese oil companies announced Thursday [12 May] they 
will raise their wholesale prices of gasoline, kerosene and gas 
oil by 0.80 or 0.90 yen per liter for deliveries after May 16. 
The companies blamed the scheduled price hikes on a rise in 
crude oil prices, which they said more than offset the 
appreciation of the yen against major foreign currencies last 
month. 
  Cosmo Oil Co. and three other companies said they will raise 
their prices by 0.80 yen, while Idemitsu and three other 
companies said they will hike theirs by 0.90 yen. 
  All companies, except Mitsubishi Oil Co., will implement the 
raises for deliveries beginning May 16. Mitsubishi will do so 
on June 1. Nippon Oil Co. announced Wednesday it will implement 
similar raises on May 20.

  [Text] Jakarta -- President Suharto reaffirmed that the 
upcoming meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum 
(APEC) leaders is important for maintaining and enhancing 
regional cooperation. 
  In a speech delivered after receiving the credentials of New 
Zealander Ambassador to Indonesia Timothy Groser here at the 
Merdeka Palace Thursday, President Suharto expressed his 
appreciation to New Zealand, which has taken an active role in 
the region through the ASEAN-New Zealand cooperation forum and 
the APEC forum. 
  The six member countries of ASEAN in cooperation with the 
Asia- Pacific countries have made an effort to maintain regional 
stability and improve the standard of living, he added. 
  He also expressed his appreciation to the New Zealand 
Government for supporting Indonesia's move to become a 
non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. 
  President Suharto also welcomed the planned visit of New 
Zealand Prime Minister James Bolger to Indonesia this month, 
saying he hoped the forthcoming visit would be beneficial for 
both countries in enhancing bilateral cooperation as well as 
giving them an opportunity to discuss a number of international 
issues. 
  In his speech, Suharto said the end of the Cold War and the 
East- West dispute has given the world an opportunity to 
consolidate economically and politically. 
  He also stated that relations and cooperation between 
nations 
could no longer be based on the old pattern of "donor and 
recipient." 
  "Relations between nations should be based on mutual 
responsibility, coexistence, mutual benefit, and respect for 
national sovereignty," he said. 
  On the occasion, President Suharto also received credentials 
from the Australian ambassador to Indonesia, Richard Demel, and 
from the representative of the European Commission to Indonesia, 
Klaus Peter Schamallenbach.

11-14 percent for savings will also rise by 0.5 percent. This 
is absolutely unavoidable. Singapore and Hong Kong, among other 
nations, have also raised their interest rates on loans. 
  Even though they are considered high nominally, Indonesia's 
rates are among the lowest if you take into account inflation 
(based on the evaluation of bankers as well as consumer index 
prices) and foreign interest rates on loans. 
  An increase would definitely impose a heavier burden on 
economic sectors that acquire loans from foreign banks, because 
such loans would have to be repaid at higher interest rates. 
This would not, however, create upheaval in the country's 
monetary sector or in its macroeconomy. On the other hand, 
should interest rates on foreign loans remain as they are, an 
economic predicament will arise. There would be, among other 
things, capital flight to other countries. 
  As such, a rise in interest rates on foreign loans by the 
banking sector is not considered a major issue that could 
agitate Indonesia's economy. The major problem, if there are 
any within the banking sector, would only relate to the issues 
of loans and stagnant credit. 
  These issues are currently negating the country's economic 
and physical development. Such problems are our own domestic 
issue. 
  The globalization of the economy, information, and 
telecommunications has brought problems to Indonesia's banking 
sector with regard to loans and stagnant credit as well as 
investors and potential foreign investors who are interested in 
coming to Indonesia. 
  The government is continuously trying to solve major 
problems. Solving major problems can be time-consuming. We are 
fortunate because foreign and other potential investors still 
trust our officials' credibility, capability, and monetary 
policies in trying to overcome major problems. 
  They are still making careful observations and adopting a 
wait- and-see [preceding three words in English] attitude as to 
what steps the government will take in its efforts to solve the 
problems. The terms "credit policies" and "loans based on 
notes," which are circulating among them, indicate what 
approaches they would like to see toward these problems before 
committing to any investments in Indonesia. 
  What do we need with their approaches when such matters are 
our domestic concern? In the current era of globalization -- 
and even more so in the future -- there will be no line drawn 
between domestic and global concerns. In fact, it will come as 
no surprise if domestic issues are always taken into 
consideration. 
  Foreign investors and potential investors are important to 
Indonesia, and they are part of the global economy. Economic 
transactions between investors and Indonesia are based on mutual 
benefit (win-win situation) [preceding three words in English] 
and will no longer be based on a presumption of winners and 
losers. 
  In the eyes of foreign investors, Indonesia could lose as a 
result of problems arising from the acquisition of foreign loans 
and the stagnant credit faced by banks, which in turn could spur 
foreign investors to reconsider making investments in the 
country. 
  Indonesia needs foreign investors, whether it is direct 
investment in industrial development or in the country's share 
or capital markets. Instability will definitely send investors 
flocking to China, India, Thailand, Malaysia, and even the 
Philippines. 
  Within the context of international economic globalization, 
no nation can determine on its own what steps it should take. 
Our problem is how to coordinate Indonesian interests with 
those of other countries. In the process of economic 
globalization, we should only acquire through compromise, trade 
transactions, and investment what belongs to us, while others 
should only take what belongs to them. 
  Once again, in connection with the problem of foreign loans 
and stagnant credit within our economy, we suggest that in this 
era of economic globalization these problems should not be 
solved according to our own terms.

  [Text] Xanana Gusmao has returned to the leadership of the 
Timorese resistance, according to the Lusa news agency. He is 
the leader, even though he is jailed. Luis Nascimento reports. 
  [Nascimento] This is how the document reelecting Xanana 
Gusmao ends: on the mountains of the Maubere [Timorese] 
motherland, on 23 March. The document is signed by commander 
Konis Santana and Laren Sabalaio, the secretary of the 
resistance's clandestine front. It is a solemn declaration that 
almost ignores the fact that Gusmao is behind bars. Ramos Horta 
[resistance leader abroad], told Lusa that he welcomed this 
symbolic reelection because it is justified by the current 
political situation. Xanana had been deposed by his comrades 
after his arrest. Ma Huno replaced him but was himself captured 
shortly thereafter. The resistance said that it had deposed 
Xanana because it did not want to create any problems for him 
before and after his trial. This reelections points to the idea 
that Xanana might be seen as the new Nelson Mandela of the 90's 
--a human rights activist jailed by a ferocious dictatorship.

  [Text] Megawati Sukarnoputri, general chairwoman of the PDI 
[Indonesian Democratic Party] DPP [Central Executive Council] 
says that the 1997 election is a moment that must be seized. If 
not, the PDI will have to wait another 10 to 15 years to become 
great. One prerequisite for taking advantage of the moment is 
maintenance of cohesiveness in the party organization. 
  Megawati made this statement Sunday, 27 March, when she held 
a gathering for PDI members at Blitar to mark the end of the 
fasting month. Present at the program were PDI DPP Chairmen 
Suparlan and Mangara Siahaan, Deputy Secretary-General Dr. 
Syafei Ali Gumai, Chairman of the East Java PDI DPD [Regional 
Executive Council] Latief Pudjosakti, and all PDI DPC [branch 
executive council] chairmen from throughout East Java. 
  According to Mega, the opportunity can be seized if the PDI 
is unified and cohesive, and not confused and quarrelsome. "What 
is the use of electing me to be general chairwoman if you are 
always quarrelsome? The PDI is not going to become great if its 
members and leaders are always quarreling. Is that what is to be 
handed down to our younger generation?" she asked. 
  Mega said that in handling the emergency situation in 
Surabaya, she tried not to be drawn into a confused an 
quarrelsome situation. She followed the situation with patience 
and firmness. "If I had not been patient and firm, I do not know 
what would have become of the PDI. Therefore, your strong 
support for me as general chairwoman of the PDI DPP must once 
more be demonstrated by eliminating all confusion and quarreling 
from the PDI organization," she asserted. 
  However, Mega continued, the greatness of the PDI does not 
depend only on the top central leadership.

  [Text] The people want the government to be more 
transparent in explaining succession processes and procedures, 
especially regarding 1998, so that the succession that is to 
take place will be truly constitutional and in accordance with 
the overall expectations of the people. Therefore, the 
legislative branch is asked to give immediate attention to 
regulations on general elections and the MPR [People's 
Consultative Assembly] SU [General Session], including the 
succession issue. 
  Prof. Dawam Rahardjo said this Friday, 25 March, in Jakarta 
in reply to a KOMPAS question. Meanwhile, Dr. Albert Hasibuan, 
member of the DPR [Parliament] from the FKP [Functional Group 
Faction], said in a separate interview that the mention of the 
succession issue by the chief of state is a sign that the issue 
needs to be discussed extensively. "This clearly was an effort 
by the chief of state to raise the political maturity of the 
Indonesian people," said Albert Hasibuan. 
  Dawam Rahardjo is of the opinion that several matters 
actually are hidden behind the expanding issue of succession. 
First, there is the question of certainty as to whether Pak 
Harto [President Suharto] will be prepared to be president or 
not. If not, he said, there is the possibility of many political 
statements before the next MPR SU. 
  Second, Dawam continued, is the succession process itself. 
Until now, this matter has appeared quite closed, such as, for 
example, with regard to presidential nominations. In the future, 
this matter must be made more transparent, so that people will 
know exactly whether a presidential candidate may campaign. 
  "Up to now, what has happened has not been clear. Several 
days after the MPR SU, a presidential candidate emerges. Is that 
good for our country? Such a method implies that the presidency 
is decided only by certain groups. Although the MPR makes the 
decision, the people should participate in giving views on the 
candidates," Dawam said emphatically. 
<H5>  President's Statement </H5>
  Touching on the president's recent explanations of 
succession, which he gave seven times, both Dawam and Albert 
Hasibuan felt it was a positive matter. The explanations were a 
sign from the chief of state that the time has come to discuss 
succession extensively and also an indication from the chief of 
state that he wants to increase the political maturity of the 
Indonesian people. 
  According to Hasibuan, open discussion of the succession 
issue is an indication that democracy is developing, because one 
of the essences of democracy is freedom of discussion and 
expression of opinion, including discussion of political 
succession. 
  Hasibuan sees the chief of state's statements on succession 
as not only an indication of political maturity and the 
existence of a democratic process, but also an effort to prevent 
the political unrest that usually occurs in some countries when 
political succession takes place. "I view the statements as a 
lesson from history, which often depicts political succession as 
accompanied by unrest," he said. 
  Nevertheless, Dawam felt the president's repeated statements 
still did not appear very clear, because it turns out that they 
have been interpreted in various ways. Dawam feels that there 
are specific intentions behind the expanding discussion of 
succession. "There are those who want the next president to be a 
new person. Thus, there appears in these developments a desire 
to conduct a process of regeneration," Dawam explained. 
  In connection with that, he continued, in order to face the 
new era the government should ensure that people begin to speak. 
If there are discussions on succession, the government should 
provide direction so that they are carried on in even greater 
detail. They should not be as in the past, when discussions were 
general and felt to be unclear. Many people still do not speak 
frankly. "The point is, there must be transparency," he asserted. 
<H5>  No Taboos </H5>
  In this context, Hasibuan said, a discussion of succession 
requires that objectivity and rationality be important matters 
in political life. This means that all political arguments, 
deliberations, and interpretations must be based on principles 
of rationality and objectivity. The element of rationality, 
based on Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian state] and the 
1945 Constitution, must be developed. 
  With this in mind, Hasibuan said, there are automatically no 
political areas that are sacred or taboo. Therefore, succession 
needs to be discussed. "Although it may have been taboo in the 
past, it is not taboo now and needs to be discussed," he said. 
  Hasibuan said further that discussion of succession must be 
oriented toward creation of political stability. "Thus, we 
cannot make talk of discussion taboo," he said. This means that 
a rational and objective discussion of succession encourages the 
view that leaders may come and go, but institutions continue. 
"That is political succession. Leaders come and go because of 
succession, but institutions continue," he said. 
  Rational and objective political succession, Hasibuan said, 
encourages the choice of leaders when it is time. "We will 
discuss the criteria for leadership. 'The right leader, at the 
right place, at the right time.' Our rationale will be to select 
the one who is suited to be a leader," he said. 
  A similar thought was expressed by Dawam, who feels that in 
the future the people expect improvements in succession 
processes and procedures, including the preparation of cadres. 
  "A candidate should not be prepared by only one group, which 
also may be a small one. That is not what the people want. The 
people want a much more extensive process of political 
participation," Dawam asserted. 
<H5>  Political Culture </H5>
  Meanwhile, Hotman M. Siahaan, lecturer at the Sociology and 
Political Science Faculty of Airlangga University, Surabaya, 
told KOMPAS that sociopolitical organizations need to anticipate 
the succession issue by improving the political culture, because 
the operation of the constitutional mechanism of succession will 
be much affected by the objective conditions of the political 
culture. 
  If succession is expected to be democratic, efforts to renew 
the political culture must begin now, so that when the moment of 
succession comes, the democratic foundation will be strong. 
According to Hotman, a tradition of democracy and openness and a 
rational, objective attitude in political life do not yet have 
strong roots in the political culture in Indonesia. Remnants of 
feudal and aristocratic culture and of thinking based on 
primordial emotions still strongly color the political culture 
in Indonesia. 
  The result is, when the succession issue--which basically is 
an essential and strategic matter in the life of a nation and 
state--emerges, it is considered strange and frightening. 
  In this context, Hotman said, beginning now it is the 
responsibility of the sociopolitical organizations to begin 
developing cultural aspects: how to select the people and how 
the mechanism can be operated honestly, objectively, and openly.

  [Text] An Islamic Center (Al Markaz Al Islami) to 
accommodate Islamic community activities in the fields of 
religion, education, health, and social and cultural affairs 
will shortly be built in the middle of the city of Ujungpandang, 
South Sulawesi. 
  The concept for the construction of an Islamic Center, which 
was originally developed in the holy city of Mekkah, has been 
positively received by a number of cabinet ministers, deputy 
cabinet ministers, and community leaders, who have expressed 
their willingness to make this idea a reality. This was stated 
by retired Gen M. Jusuf. 
  At the program for opening the Muslim month of fasting in 
Jakarta on 3 March the deputy chairman of BAPEKA [Financial 
Inspection Board] said that the Islamic Center is intended to 
help the government to train Indonesians to be healthy and well 
educated and to believe in God. 
  The Islamic Center will stand on a nine hectare piece of 
ground which formerly was part of the campus of Hasanuddin 
University. General Jusuf said that a mosque will be built at 
the Islamic Center to accommodate 10,000 of the faithful as well 
as a meeting hall with a capacity of 5,000 people. 
  As quoted by ANTARA news agency, Jusuf added that in 
addition 
a building for Islamic educational programs will be constructed, 
ranging from kindergarten through SLTA [senior technical high 
school]. It will be equipped with a library, a laboratory, and a 
polyclinic. For students who come from outside the city of 
Ujungpandang dormitories will be built for both boys and girls. 
  A foundation to manage the Islamic Center has already been 
established. A number of cabinet ministers and deputy ministers, 
in their private capacities, have expressed their willingness to 
sit on the executive council of the foundation. 
  They are: Azwar Anas (coordinating minister for the people's 
welfare), Ginandjar Kartasasmita (minister of state for national 
development planning and also chairman of BAPPENAS--the National 
373 Development Planning Board), R. M. Yogi Suardi Memet 
(minister of home affairs), Edi Sudrajat (minister of defense 
and security), Tunky Ariwibowo (minister of industry), Mar'ie 
Muhammad (minister of finance), Dr Tarmizi Taher (minister of 
religious affairs), Doctor Sujudi (minister of health), Radinal 
Moochtar (minister of public works), and Abdul Latief (minister 
of manpower). 
  Other figures who have expressed their willingness to take 
part in this activity are Gen Feisal Tanjung (commander of the 
Indonesian armed forces), Gen Wismoyo Arismunandar (Army chief 
of staff), and Dr Nurcholis Madjid. Meanwhile, Dr Munawir 
Sadzali (deputy minister of home affairs) has stated that he is 
willing to take part in this project. 
  Jusuf declared that the Islamic Center which is to be 
constructed will belong to the religious community and 
especially to the Islamic community. Therefore, he invited the 
Islamic community to complete its construction successfully. 
  Aburizal Bakrie, general chairman of KADIN [Indonesian 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry], led a group of businessmen 
who attended the meeting, including H. Sudwikatmono, H. Ibrahim 
Risjad, H. Yusuf Kalla, Fadel Muhammad, Tantri Abeng, Prayogo 
Pangestu, and Henri Pribadi. They also expressed their 
willingness to help in making this plan a reality. 
  Mar'ie Muhammad (minister of finance), who spoke in his 
private capacity, said that the objective of constructing the 
Islamic Center is not only to build a mosque and school. This 
project reaches far into the future, involving national 
development and the national character. 
  Meanwhile, Nurcholis Madjid, a young Islamic leader who also 
spoke at the meeting, said that the construction of the Islamic 
Center is an appropriate objective. This activity is a forward 
step in anticipating the needs of the Islamic community during 
the coming decades.

<F P=106> [Interview with Khun Sa by Prawit Rotchanaphruk, Bunloet </F>
Siakim, and Dom Suwana; place, date not given] 
  [Text] The Burmese have made some advance and they 
are now on the western side of the Salween River, how do you see 
the situation? 
  I'm not worried at all if the Burmese could have crossed 
(the 
river) they would have done it. It's not that they have taken 
pity on us, or that we are their brothers, the fact is that they 
can't. I sleep peacefully at night and actually I really want 
them to cross (the river) to our side if they can so I can shoot 
them myself. 
  You see, the Salween River doesn't belong to the Burmese, it 
belongs to us -- the Thai Yai. If Thais think about utilizing 
our four main rivers (Nam Salween, Nam Muang Phuek, Nam Muang 
Sat, Nam Muang Loi), the Thai brothers, the Thai millionaires 
and the Thais in the private sector should help Khun Sa a bit. 
Once we can stand up against the Burmese, we will drive them 
back to where they belong. And Thais can make use of the rivers. 
  /How much area of the Shan State is under MTA (Muang 
Tai Army or the Army of the Tai Nation) influence? 
  We have control over two-thirds of the Shan state. 
  How do you look at the proposed quadrangular economic 
sphere that includes Burma, China, Laos and Thailand? Who do 
you think will really benefit from it? 
  I don't think of it as an economic road, it's a strategic 
road for the Chinese only. The Chinese have spent many hours 
thinking of ways to outsmart the Burmese, Laotians and Thais. 
The Chinese want to build a bridge across the Salween River and 
build railways so they can send their troops down to Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Shan state and Burma within 24 hours. It is 
not about the economy. 
  You have said that if the Thai government helps you, 
the MTA would surely defeat the SLORC (Burma's ruling State 
Order Restoration Council), can you elaborate? 
  I will push all the Burmese out of Shan state because they 
invaded us first, they also broke the Panglong treaty that 
recognized Shan independence. Because of all this, the MTA 
doesn't have to look for soldiers, men come willingly. These 
men voluntarily take arms to force the Burmese out. All we need 
are some arms and money. 
  The Burmese have only the rice and the sea to depend on, 
nothing else. All the rest of the natural resources that they 
are selling to foreigners belongs to us, the Thai Yai, so may I 
request everyone not to buy Burmese goods. Those goods actually 
belong to us, the Thai Yai. Once they get money, they buy guns 
to kill us. Thais and Tai (the other name for Thai Yai) are 
brothers. We share the same blood, the same King and Queen. If 
Shan gained independence, it would be another Tai state, and the 
name of His Majesty the King would be spread even further. 
Thais will trade with Tai, and the Thai economy will be even 
better. 
  Does this mean that once Shan gains independence, it 
will become part of Thailand? 
  No, not as such. 
  Besides other ethnic groups in Shan state, have you 
been negotiating with other armed minorities like Kayah, Karen 
or Mon about political and economic alliances? 
  I have delegated respective people to negotiate with the 
Karen and Kayah to come up with a draft constitution of the new 
confederation of states and to see if we can have an alliance of 
sort like the European Community. 
  Given the present situation, what are you most 
worried about? 
  There are only two things that worry me: money and arms, 
nothing more. 
  How do you view the combined income you derive from 
opium and heroin taxes that you collect and those from the sales 
of Shan's jade, ruby and sapphires in relation to the amount you 
spent to keep the MTA running? 
  That money is good for the purchase of our soldiers' boots 
only (laughs). 
  The United States government always tells all its 
allies that having any kind of relationship with Khun Sa is 
wrong. What do you think of your reputation as the King of 
Opium, the man who is responsible for the loss of millions of 
lives, especially in the United States, due to heroin? 
  The United States government sent someone to ask me about 
it. 
But I think they are crazy! And all they did was wrong. Now, 
they have realized that what they did in the past was wrong and 
they've started to talk with me. 
  What about the mass media? You are portrayed as an 
opium crook who causes millions of death. 
  The United States had also sent someone to ask me I told 
them 
that the killer is not me, but the US DEA. I do political work, 
I'm not an opium trader. 
  I collect (protection) taxes from traders, and this is the 
truth. And I also don't have to catch (the growers and traders). 
Who would I send them to? I just need the taxes to feed my 
soldiers. 
  Don't you think that your act alone is indirectly 
causing suffering? 
  That's up to what you think but I don't care. Americans 
trade drugs too, so do the British don't they? But I see no one 
making a big fuss over those people. I think some people made 
me a target to earn money. They know that I don't grow opium. 
  If there was anything that you could convey to the 
millions who are addicted to heroin and opium, what would it 
be? 
  First, I know that opium is not a good thing, it destroys 
one's health I quit growing opium in 1962, before anyone else. 
That year I initiated a tobacco plantation. I built 80 medical 
centres and 80 schools until the Burmese collaborated with the 
KMT (Kuomintang, the nationalist Chinese) and attacked us. Most 
medical units were destroyed but some schools still remain 
today. Local people can verify this. 
  If I met an addict, I would bring him in for rehabilitation. 
We have a rehabilitation centre here. I feel concern for four 
groups of people: the opium growers, the addicts, the traders 
and those who are jailed for narcotic related charges. I feel 
pity that drugs destroyed their families. 
  In 1977, the United States government sent Mr Josef Nellis 
to 
negotiate with me. I proposed to him a 6-year opium eradication 
scheme but the US refused. Since then, I don't know how many 
six year terms have repeated themselves but the amount of opium 
production in Shan and Burma were at 200 tonnes per year before 
British colonization. But since the inception of the DEA, the 
number has increased to over 4,000 tonnes. The money that the 
DEA put in became a good fertilizer for opium. What I would 
like to say is, "Don't make a big fuss over it." 
  If those who are after me say that Khun Sa is the undisputed 
Opium King, then why not come to get me? If you want to catch 
the main goon come and get the chief goon not those minute 
hooligans. But they don't so when can the crime be eradicated? 
  I made a proposition to the Thai government too. I wanted to 
tell them that it's not a big deal if we really want to 
eradicate opium but don't do it the DEA way. Or don't do it the 
UN's way because what they are doing now is like trimming a 
tree. They should come to me and uproot the tree. I really 
look forward to cooperating with all parties. If we have enough 
money to live and fight to attain independence we could 
eradicate all the opium fields in one day. The existing opium 
can be sold to any nation interested and it can be dumped 
wherever they wish.

<F P=106> [Article by Prawit Rotchanaphruk: "Using Evil in the Fight </F>
for Freedom"] 
  [Text] Being responsible for nation's political and 
external affairs is no easy task. It's even more difficult when 
that country not recognized by world communities, when one third 
of its land is under foreign occupation, and when that country 
has been at war for most the last four decades. 
  The situation becomes even more complicated when the 
president of that country is on the US Drug Enforcement Agency's 
(DEA) most wanted list for narcotics-relate charges, and when 
the president's nickname is the "Opium King" or "Prince of 
Darkness". 
  It's a daunting task for anyone. However 46-year-old 
Khuensai Chaiyen, top political aide to Khun Sa, the 
self-proclaimed leader of the Shan State, takes it all in his 
stride. His pride in his state is visible in his bespectacled 
eyes. 
  "We Thai Yai (also known as Tai, the major ethnic group in 
the Shan State and a close relative of the Thai people) fought 
alongside the Burmese for independence from the British colonial 
masters. But in 1952 (four years after Burma gained 
independence) the Rangoon government sent its troops to invade 
and occupy the Shan State. And I grew up under the Burmese 
occupation. 
  Now as secretary of external affairs for the Shan State 
Restoration Council (SSRC), Khunsai is an old hand at local and 
external affairs. 
  It's been 25 years now since Khunsai first became involved 
with the revolutionary activities that eventually led to the 
unofficial independence in 1958 of the 160,000 square kilometres 
of land that make up Shan State, just north of Thailand. 
  Born to a merchant family in 1948 in the Nam San 
principality 
of Shan State, Khunsai was better off than the average Shan 
family. When the time came, he managed to pursue a university 
education in chemistry at the Mandalay Arts and Science 
University. But growing up under foreign occupation eventually 
raised many questions in the mind of the young student. 
  "I asked myself why the Thai Yai had to learn the Burmese 
language? Why the Burmese didn't like us to wear traditional 
Thai Yai pants? Why the Burmese enjoyed more civil rights than 
we did? Why many able Thai Yai people had to work under Burmese 
who were not as competent? And why we had to obey them?" 
  These many whys haunted him, and eventually Khunsai decided 
to become involved with anti-Burmese activities. However, it 
was not long before the authorities found out. 
  "I had to leave university after my third year of 
education," 
Khunsai recalled. His dreams of becoming a scientist were 
shattered. But a higher dream brought him to work for the Shan 
United Revolutionary Army (Sura). 
  Though he didn't excel in the military field, Khunsai was a 
witty, intelligent person, able to converse in English, Burmese, 
Thai Yai and Thai. He chose political work and soon the young 
Khunsai proved his pen was mightier than many men's swords as he 
speedily climbed the Sura ladder. 
  In the mid seventies, on the eastern side of the Shan State, 
another powerful Shan army, with money funded by heroin and 
opium trade, was growing under the control of Khun Sa. But 
soon, the uncontested Opium King who claimed to be a freedom 
fighter was pushed out of Ban Hin Taek in Mae Chan District of 
Chiang Rai province by the Royal Thai Army for being the US 
DEA's enemy number one. 
  Then in 1985 Khun Sa decided to join forces with Sura and 
make the little village of Ho Mong, just north of Mae Hong Son 
province, the new army base. Eventually Khun Sa became 
president of the SSRC and commander in chief of the Muang Tai 
Army [MTA] or the Army of the Tai Nation. 
  In the years that followed Khunsai became associated with 
Khun Sa and soon became his top political aide. He also saw Ho 
Mong, a sleepy village embraced on all sides by green mountain 
ranges, grow into a relatively modern town with 20,000 
civilians, electricity, a high school, dozens of shops, a 
karaoke bar, a 60-bed hospital and gem emporium. The village is 
also the base of the MTA, which, according to Khun Sa, boasts 
some 47,000 members, some armed with advanced Soviet-made 
weapons. The prosperous town has become the centre of Khunsai's 
hopes for independence. 
  But most of the town's wealth is not "clean" money. Despite 
recent attempts to capitalize on the Shan State's abundance of 
jade, rubies and blue sapphires, much of the state's wealth 
comes from the notorious opium plant. 
  "There are two things we do with opium and heroin," Khunsai 
said matter-of-factly. "First, we allow opium caravans or 
heroin refineries to be set up under our protection. Second, we 
collect taxes from them. We could have set up these refineries 
ourselves, but then they would be state owned, and that wouldn't 
be proper. So the private sector is taking care of it." 
  Khun Sa, according to critics, is -- at least in part -- 
responsible for the millions of people in the United States, 
Europe and Asia for whom drug addiction has ruined their lives. 
The Shan State is the world's major site for opium cultivation 
and heroin production. The top quality white powder heroin the 
state produces fetches up to US$200,000 (Bt [baht] 5 million) 
per kilogram once it reaches the United States. That's 20 times 
what the drug is worth on the streets of Bangkok. With such 
profits to be made, each year hundreds of million of dollars 
changes hands. 
  "Nobody wants to see opium and heroin, not even the growers 
themselves," said Khunsai defending his raison d'etre. "If 
there was peace in my country I would rather do something else. 
But we have to fight the Burmese, so who can we go to for 
money? Nobody is helping us, so what can we do? Please help me 
think about it too," he asked seriously. 
  "If the Bangkok Bank would loan me some money I would 
surely apply for it." 
  If opium is to be eliminated, said Khunsai, people must 
first 
know where it comes from. The secretary claimed that at one 
time, the Thai Yai grew one seventh of the total amount of opium 
produced in Shan State. But now, he said, almost all the ethnic 
groups in the state are involved with growing the deadly plant. 
  He pointed to three major reasons behind the surge in opium 
production. "The first and second reasons are that the now 
defunct Kuomintang (KMT) and the former Communist Party of Burma 
(CPB) encouraged local people to grow (opium). Third, the 
Rangoon government wanted to lay blame on us. They forced us in 
every way they could. So we had no choice but to depend on 
opium money. 
  "The KMT and CPB are now defunct, but the Burmese are still 
there. As long as they are still around (in the Shan State), it 
will be impossible to solve this issue. We must drive them 
out," he concluded. 
  But even if they succeed, Khun Sa's reputation may never 
change in the eyes of the world. While Khunsai regards his 
president as a man who can cope under all circumstances, Khun Sa 
can not evade the world's condemnation for his narcotic related 
activities. 
  "Making Khun Sa the Opium King is a political game," said 
Khunsai, defending his boss. We were unlucky that the DEA was 
formed with the least credible police the United States has 
known. They (the DEA) did it (put Khun Sa on their most wanted 
list) for their own benefit. 
  "Do you think they really want to arrest Khun Sa? If so, why 
is the prize for his head just Bt500.000? The sum... would not 
even cover a rich man's expenses for a year. All this means 
that the DEA wants Khun Sa to live so the DEA can get a bigger 
budget and hold on to their jobs." 
  Meanwhile, as the war with the Burmese drags on, Khunsai is 
attempting to change the world's attitude toward Khun Sa and the 
struggle for Shan independence. Khunsai said he was well aware 
that the longer the war continues, the more tears will be shed. 
  After four decades of war, thousands and thousands of young 
men have gone to the front line. Many never return. The MTA, 
in need of new recruits, will enlist another 4,000 soldiers this 
year, many as young as 16 and many of them conscripts. All 
families with a son are obliged to send at least one of their 
sons to serve in the MTA. 
  "Those under 16 are not eligible to be soldiers but they 
must 
undergo years of military preparation," he explained. "If they 
are 10 years old, they are ready to receive training, and they 
are strong enough to carry guns. 
  "These kids have strong hearts, they have always wanted to 
go 
to war. Once there was an order for these youngsters to march 
to the Salween River. 
  These kids thought they were finally going to fight, but 
they 
were disappointed once they realized they were only sent to 
carry wounded soldiers back on stretchers." 
  But through political maneuvering, Khunsai hopes speedy 
victory or independence will be achieved. "We are negotiating 
with different ethnic groups. The Wa (another large ethnic 
group situated on the northeastern side of the Shan State along 
the Shan- Chinese border) army will soon forge an alliance with 
us. The Burmese have used the Wa to attack us in the past. But 
that ploy is dwindling along with the strength of the Wa army. 
  "But it (the Burmese-Wa alliance) will not last long. The 
Burmese lack dollars so they hired the Wa to burn opium fields 
as a ploy to ploy to get money from the West and the Wa received 
rice in return. The Chinese government no longer wants to 
support the Wa. Over the past two or three months, the Burmese 
have cut down their supply of rice to the Wa army to 1,500 sacks 
per month, down from 4,000. 
  It's not enough and the Wa also know they are being used as 
a 
tool to earn Slorc (Burma's State Law and Order Restoration 
Council) some hard currency." Khunsai is also optimistic about 
the possibility of economic forging ties with Thailand. 
  "If businessmen come to trade with and develop the Shan 
State, all they will think about will be the profits. They 
won't think about the political issues, they just want to make 
money. So we forwarded a letter to His Majesty [HM] the King of 
Thailand saying it would best for His Majesty to initiate trade 
relations, as he is the symbol of unity not just for Thais, but 
for the greater Tai race. 
  "Aside from logging and fishing concessions, what will the 
Thais get from the Burmese? Nothing," he continued. "But 
gemstones and teak wood, are all in the Shan State. But our 
state is a landlocked nation. So if we want to find a sea 
route, which would be the best way? Through Thailand. The 
proposed Salween Dam and quadrangular economic sphere is also in 
the Shan State. Our two nations are of the same Tai race. 
Chinese trade with Chinese, so Thai should trade with Thai 
(Yai). We have all the raw materials, cheap labour and we can 
absorb small and medium scale industries from Thailand." 
  To date, no reply from HM the King has been received, 
however 
Khunsai still waits in hope. 
  At present, nearly 10,000 Burmese troops are also waiting on 
the west side of the Salween River. They are waiting to begin a 
major offensive drive before the rainy season arrives. The 
independence of the Shan State and its 8 million people is still 
far from being recognized by the United Nations and the price on 
the president's head remains in place. 
  But while the rain clouds will soon loom over Ho Mong, 
Khunsai holds tight to his faith. "I want to see Shan 
independence" he said. "But it won't come fast. Every day, I 
hear more and more cases of human rights violations committed by 
the Burmese. Many people in Burma are suffering. They were 
used (by Slorc) as vehicles to attain absolute power and then 
they were discarded and killed. I really want the ordeal to be 
over now." 
  Khunsai believes independence of the Shan State will happen 
during his lifetime. "It's 99 per cent certain," Khunsai 
predicted with an air of confidence. 
  But what about the remaining 1 per cent? 
  "The last 1 per cent," Khunsai replied, "depends on karma, 
on 
the good and bad deeds that all of the Thai Yai have committed. 
  "Lord Buddha must have lied to me if what I did was wrong," 
he said. "For all these 25 long years, all I have done was for 
my country."

  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 12 (AFP) -- Cambodia's King Norodom 
Sihanouk said Thursday that new blood tests by French doctors 
here showed he had "very, very serious health problems" 
indicating that he would die shortly. 
  "I have no future because I am going to die very soon," a 
distressed King Sihanouk told reporters at the Royal Palace. 
  French doctors who took the blood samples sent the tests to 
the king's doctors at Beijing Hospital. 
  "The results are not good," the king said. "The doctors in 
China told me, 'You have a problem. The cancer is still 
threatening your life.'" 
  King Sihanouk, 71, has been undergoing chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy in Beijing since October following the 
discovery and removal of a malignant tumor near his prostate 
gland. The cancer has since spread to his bone marrow. 
  The king, a mild diabetic, also said the tests showed he has 
an accumulation of fat around his liver and continuing problems 
with arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. 
  King Sihanouk was originally scheduled to return to China on 
June 2, but he said that he was moving up his departure two 
weeks to May 18, in frustration at the bickering of politicians 
here and his inability to solve the Cambodian conflict after 
UN-sponsored elections last year. 
  "It is true that I have very, very serious health problems, 
so .... I prefer to go now to Beijing because I am not happy 
with politicians here," he said.

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk could 
assume full powers within the Royal Government. This could 
materialize if speculations about an impending amendment to the 
less than a year old national constitution is executed. 
  Senior government ministers who demanded anonymity said: 
"Both senior members of the Royal Government, the FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] and the CPP [Cambodian People's Party] 
have reportedly agreed to such a move." 
  "The amendment will see His Majesty assuming full powers 
under a wide ranging decree for a limited period of time." 
  "This is designed to give King Sihanouk, on behalf of the 
beleaguered Royal Government, some measures of respectability to 
come out with concrete solutions to the numerous problems 
currently faced." 
  "The Royal Government, as widely suspected, is unable to 
solve the many problems such as social unrest and instability 
because of Khmer rouge elements and defeats at their hands, as 
well as lack of numerous visible developments and progresses." 
  "This move seems to be the only way to restore the 
credibility of the Royal Government and the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
His Majesty is the only one capable of restoring peace, 
prosperity and stability to this nation." 
  "As such, the members of the National Assembly, when called 
upon to vote for their amendments are bound to say yes as they 
too want to see continued peace and the restoration of 
stability." 
  "His Majesty Sihanouk will bring back a semblance of order 
to 
this nation and this will also suppress the internal feuding 
among members of both parties amongst themself as well as with 
each other," the officials said. 
  Foreign diplomats, although sceptical of such a wide 
sweeping 
move, are nevertheless convinced that the amendments, if raised 
and passed, will indeed see an introduction fresh ideas from a 
stateman and a political leader who has survived and persisted 
throughout the turmoil. 
  "The King seems convinced that the Khmer Rouge issue should 
be resolved through peaceful negotiations although he supports 
the military action by the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces." 
  "The Kingdom of Cambodia needs the services of His Majesty 
and the co-Premiers should not feel belittled by the move to 
give the King full powers, as it could be only for a limited 
period of time and not eternal," the diplomats said. 
  The King has reportedly delivered stinging criticism to the 
Royal Government for its reported inability to resolve issues 
which have been arising of late, including the seemingly rampant 
insecurity and instability, even within the city here. 
  However, some other senior ministers although confirming 
such 
speculations, has cast doubts as to whether it will be passed by 
the National Assembly, let alone get sufficient support.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 12 (AFP) -- King Norodom Sihanouk 
said Thursday that the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia was 
a waste of three billion dollars, as because there is no hope 
for peace in his country. 
  "I have no illusions. I know there will be no compromise in 
Jakarta, Paris, anywhere," the king told journalists at the 
Royal Palace, explaining that he was leaving for China two weeks 
earlier than planned, in part because he had no hope of solving 
Cambodia's ongoing conflict. 
  "Even with 100 round tables (peace talks), there will be no 
peace," the king said, apologizing to the United Nations for 
sending 20,000 peacekeepers to enforce a peace plan and hold 
elections last year. 
  "It was a waste," the king cried disparagingly. "We did not 
deserve those three billion dollars, because our behavior is so 
bad." 
  The ailing 71-year-old king, who spoke for more than one 
hour 
about politics, his eventual death and his despair over the 
situation that remains in Cambodia, said he was continuing to 
offer solutions for peace out of desperation. 
  The Khmer Rouge want ultimately to retake power in Cambodia 
and return it to "the Stone Age" in line with their communist 
ideology, he said. 
  "They have not changed their leadership, their policy, their 
approach," he said. "Even when they say they accept a round 
table, it is not sincere. They are not sincere. They are just 
maneuvering to show plenty of good will," the king said. 
  "I must confess today ... that as king, I have to promise 
peace," he said, adding that the prospect was "very bleak." 
  "Knowing we are going towards the death of Cambodia, I 
should 
not remain as king ... but if there remains civil war, people 
would say it is because the king has left us," King Sihanouk 
said. 
  "I am in a very bad situation, worse than Shakespeare's 
hero, 
Hamlet," he said.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 12 (AFP) -- Cambodian King Norodom 
Sihanouk stressed Thursday that his country's only hope against 
the Khmer Rouge was foreign military aid, after the United 
States said it was considering providing arms to the Cambodian 
government. 
  Military aid is needed "to save Cambodia from the yoke of 
the 
Khmer Rouge, from genocide ... (and) maintain Cambodia as a 
liberal democracy and member of the free world," King Sihanouk 
told reporters at the Royal Palace. 
  "They need everything: new weapons, planes, helicopters, 
tanks and also ... ambulances," the king said. 
  The appeal followed comments by a U.S. State Department 
official in Washington on Wednesday that the United States was 
considering "the possible provision of lethal assistance" in 
view of recent guerrilla activities. 
  But the official, U.S. Deputy Assistant of State for East 
Asian and Pacific Affairs Peter Tomsen, told a congressional 
committee that the United States would have to consult other 
members of the international community before taking any action. 
  The king last week said he favored having foreign countries 
-- including the United States, France and Australia -- arm, 
equip and train Cambodia's army. 
  King Sihanouk said the failure of government troops to 
maintain their hold on the Khmer Rouge base at Pailin in 
northwest Cambodia, which they captured March 19, showed how 
badly government forces were in need of training. The Cambodian 
government has admitted that corrupt commanders spent more time 
dividing the spoils of the resource-rich region than defending 
it. 
  "Their behavior in Pailin was not good at all, so there is a 
necessity to re-educate our soldiers, to train them and to equip 
them," he said. 
  He added that the forces needed "lessons on behavior," 
referring to reports from human rights watchdog Amnesty 
International, who condemned the beheading of a Khmer Rouge 
prisoner of war by government troops last week in Cambodia's 
northwest. 
  King Sihanouk said the West "should not say on the one hand 
that we must save Cambodia from the yoke of Pol Pot ... and on 
the other hand give nothing to the royal government.

<F P=106> ["KCF Slams S. Korean Puppets' Nuclear Development" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- "The South Korean 
puppets would face a stern judgement by history, if they persist 
in the development of nuclear weapons, going against the 
aspirations of the times and the nation, warned Kang Yong-sop, 
chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Korean Christians 
Federation [KCF]. 
  In a statement on Wednesday he denounced the despicable 
criminal acts of the South Korean puppet clique in stepping up 
nuclear development on a full scale while spreading a rumour of 
"nuclear suspicion" against the North. 
  The statement says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique's groundless slanders on us over the 
fictitious "nuclear problem" are nothing but a cunning and 
brazen trick to divert elsewhere the public attention at home 
and abroad and step up the development of nuclear arms behind 
the scene. 
  This is well illustrated by the fact that the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam told a "press conference" some time ago that "the North 
has no nukes", thus admitting of his own accord that his 
clique's row hitherto over the "nuclear development" of the 
North was a plot to do harm to the fellow countrymen and conceal 
the truth behind their own development of nuclear arms. 
  It is because of the partiality of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency that the South Korean puppets' nuclear arms 
development has long been out of the world people's concern, the 
statement notes, adding: The agency must draw a serious lesson 
from such grave consequences of the double standard which it has 
applied under the baton of the United States, losing 
independence, and restore impartiality, though belatedly. 
  The South Korean puppets must ponder over catastrophic 
consequences to be entailed by their criminal nuclear arms 
development, eliminate at once the heavy water reactor and 
multipurpose research reactor which have been confirmed to be 
reactors for developing nuclear weapons, stop the development of 
a fast breeder reactor and nuclear arms development, the 
statement stresses.

<F P=106> ["S. Korean Puppets' Intrigue To Kidnap DPRK Lumbermen </F>
Denounced" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- If the South Korean 
rulers continue attempting to kidnap our lumbermen working in 
the far east of Russia, they will drink a bitter cup, warned the 
Ministry of Forestry of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea in a statement today. 
  The statement reads: 
  On April 9, through a statement of the spokesman of the 
Ministry of Forestry, we made clear our principled stand toward 
the criminal intrigues of the South Korean rulers to kidnap our 
timber fellers working in the far east of Russia. The South 
Korean puppets, however, continue behaving arrogantly, ignoring 
our logical warning. 
  According to recent reports from South Korea, the puppets, 
in 
an effort to make the kidnapping plot more organised, impudently 
"adopted" what they call "principle of allowing exile" at the 
"Unification and Security Policy Coordinating meeting" on April 
15 and formed even a "working measure committee" on May 4 and 
are blaring that they will work out "comprehensive measures" for 
kidnapping our timber fellers. 
  On the other hand, they have sent agents of the "Security 
Planning Board" and riff-raffs to various areas of the far east 
of Russia under various names for an operation to allure and 
kidnap our workers. 
  This indicates that the kidnapping intrigues of the South 
Korean puppets have already entered a practical stage and the 
North-South confrontation aggravated by them is being expanded 
to the soil of Russia. 
  The Ministry of Forestry of the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea bitterly denounces the intrigues of the South Korean 
puppets which are getting more desperate, branding them as an 
open challenge to our Republic, an anti-humanitarian act 
encroaching upon the dignity of our forestry workers and an act 
intended to undermine the traditional friendship between the 
Korean and Russian peoples. 
  These intrigues of the South Korean puppets have become a 
serious matter related to the prospect of the North-South 
relations and the dignity of the nation. 
  If they persist in their operation to kidnap our dignified 
workers by misrepresenting facts, in defiance of our reasonable 
warning, they will drink a bitter cup. 
  Our lumbermen working in the far east of Russia are now 
getting very angry at their kidnapping operation. They are 
resolved to deal a hard blow at the South Korean puppets who are 
foolish enough to persistently try to make them defect to South 
Korea. 
  If a mishap occurs to one of them, our lumbermen will make a 
decisive reprisal on the South Korean puppets. Their resolution 
is an entirely legitimate one for defending their dignity and 
honor. 
  If the South Korean puppets continue attempting to kidnap 
fellow countrymen and perpetrating provocations causing national 
shame in an alien land in disregard of our patience, they will 
be held wholly responsible for all the consequences arising 
therefrom and the nation and history will pass a stern judgement 
on them. 
  The South Korean puppets' plot to kidnap our lumbermen in 
the 
far east is an international crime to impair the traditional 
friendship between the Korean and Russian peoples and create 
unrest in the territories of Russia. 
  Therefore, we consider that the Russian authorities must not 
allow the sinister acts of the South Korean puppets in the far 
east. 
  We set store by the traditional friendship between the 
peoples of Korea and Russia and are actively striving to 
strengthen and develop it, and believe that the Russian 
authorities will ponder over our principled stand.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Kim In-so's eldest 
daughter Kim Hwa-sim and Ham Se-hwan's elder sister Ham Suk-nyo 
sent letters to the national Red Cross organisations of 
different countries, calling for their active cooperation in the 
repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan who are now detained 
in South Korea after being forced to a long prison life for 
refusing ideological conversion. 
  In the letters they earnestly asked the national Red Cross 
organisations that defend human rights and value Red Cross 
humanitarianism to pay attention to the miserable lot of their 
families and launch an active international campaign for an 
early repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. 
  Kim Hwa-sim said: 
  "I feel my heart rending when I think of my father who spent 
more than 30 years in prison and is suffering in a land away 
from home, not allowed to return home in his declining years. 
  "The South Korean Red Cross unreasonably refuses to send 
back 
my father. This is a very wrong behavior ignoring international 
law and Red Cross humanitarianism. 
  "My father's repatriation is not only his wish but also the 
unanimous demand of the entire fellow countrymen and human 
conscience." 
  Ham Suk-nyo said: "It is two years since I heard that my 
brother whom I had thought dead during the Korean war was alive, 
but my ardent wish to see him in my lifetime has not yet been 
realised." 
  She called on the national Red Cross organisations to deeply 
understand the anxious wish of an octogenarian to see her 
younger brother whom she had raised on her back.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Kim Chae-su who had 
been the manager of the East Fisheries Company No. 100 of South 
Korea before defecting to the North through a third country and 
his family which came with him were interviewed here today. 
  Hailing from Chunchon, South Korean Kangwon Province, he, 
34, 
served the puppet Army and then worked as a ground man of an 
airline company and a crime-prevention team member of a police 
box. 
  He has in South Korea his father running a rice mill, his 
stepmother and two half brothers and two half sisters. 
  He said he came to the North because he hated the U.S. 
imperialist aggressors and the South Korean rulers courting 
their favor. 
  "When I was six years old, GI's stormed into my house and 
violated my mother. Later, my mother suffered from insomnia and 
left home and her whereabouts is still unknown," he said, and 
continued: 
  "I have keenly felt that the Yankees are not only the enemy 
who brought tragedy to our family but also the enemy of the 
nation who divided our country into two and imposed sorrow and 
sufferings upon the whole nation." 
  He said he began to sympathize with the independent politics 
of the North, and he felt his deep-seated grudge was wreaked by 
General Kim Chong-il when he drove Americans into a tight corner 
through DPRK-USA talks, standing in solo confrontation with the 
United States to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. "I could not repress an urge to rush at a run to the 
general and make a deep bow to him in gratitude," he added. 
  He said he decided to carry into practice his long-conceived 
plan to go over to the North and, at last, came over to the 
embrace of the great President Kim Il-song and the dear leader 
Kim Chong-il, together with his family. 
  Pointing out that anti-American sentiments are growing among 
South Korean puppet Airforce units, he said if the United States 
and the traitor Kim Yong-sam unleash a war against the North, 
the "ROK Army" would turn their guns at the U.S. troops and 
their stooges, not fighting the fellow countrymen in the North. 
  The wife of Kim Chae-su, Mun Chong-cha, 34, referring to the 
educational conditions of South Korea, said that in the South 
there must be a colossal amount of money if one want his child 
to receive a higher education and acquire a special knowledge. 
"One must have 50,000 dollars to get his child through schools 
up to the high school," she added. 
  She said she saw that everything was wonderful in the North, 
but particularly grateful was that the state was bringing up 
children and enabling them to bring their talent into full play. 
She said she felt like giving birth even to ten children in 
such a society good to live in. 
  Touching upon the public sentiments toward the present 
"civilian" regime, Kim Chae-su said it is the present-day 
feeling of the people in the South that nothing can be expected 
of Kim Yong-sam and he must be removed. 
  He said: 
  "Now, there are various queer nicknames for Kim Yong-sam, 
such as a fascist maniac, traitor and illiterate, the like of 
which no other ruler in the world had ever been called by. They 
are nicknames ridiculing him about his treacheries, perfidy, 
falsity and deception. 
  "There is nobody in the South who feels sympathy with Kim 
Yong-sam. Everybody says he must be killed. The public 
sentiments of the South being such, the day is not far off when 
he will meet his doom." 
  Kim Chae-su's son, Kim Un-chol, 11, said he practised 
Taekwon-do in the South to protect himself from rogues but, now, 
in the North, he would develop his Taekwon-do skill with 
redoubled vigor so as to fly high the flag of the DPRK in the 
world. 
  Kim Chae-su said: 
  "The history of our nation and the realities of the North 
and 
the South show that the destiny of a country and nation entirely 
depends on its leader. 
  "Now the North is displaying its might as a big power 
worldwide and the country is prospering and all the people are 
living in happiness. It owes this to the great President Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Kim Chong-il."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppet 
Marine units and the U.S. Marines staged a "joint airlifting and 
dropping operation" and a "joint field training" on the East 
coast of Korea, according to a Radio No. 1 report from Seoul 
Tuesday. 
  These provocative military exercises codenamed "increase of 
the joint operation capacity" were a real war gamble of the U.S. 
imperialists and the puppet clique to drop Marines by transport 
planes and helicopters on supposed "enemy-controlled areas" to 
blast dam, bridge and other major setups and obstacles there. 
  The puppet clique, instigated by the U.S. imperialists, is 
now staging large-scale naval manoeuvces in the West Sea of 
Korea, with the mobilization of various types of battleships. 
  Thus, the coastal areas of the Korean peninsula are turning 
into a training place for a war against the northern half of 
Korea.

<F P=106> ["Arms Buildup Aimed at Killing Many Birds With One Stone" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The United States is 
seeking to kill many birds with one stone by beefing up its 
Armed Forces in and around South Korea, says NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today. 
  The paper says: 
  First of all, the United States intends to stifle Korean 
socialism with strength by reinforcing its Armed Forces in 
South Korea. It is the invariable policy of the U.S. to 
aggravate military confrontation and tensions on the Korean 
peninsula, threaten the DPRK with strength and, furthermore, 
stifle it. 
  The U.S. bellicose elements plan to send military strength 
600,000 strong, over 200 combatant ships, more than 1,600 
warplanes and other aggression forces which are far greater than 
those hurled into the Persian Gulf war to the Korean front in 80 
days in "case of emergency" on the Korean peninsula. 
  Another purpose of the United States in its arms buildup in 
and around South Korea is to attain the goal of its 
Asian-Pacific policy. 
  The keynote of the U.S. Asian-Pacific strategy at present is 
to curb the expansion of the sphere of influence of the Western 
countries in this area by relying upon its military predominance 
and to establish U.S.-orchestrated dominationist order. In 
this, it attaches importance especially to Northeast Asia and 
intends to keep powerful frontline combat power in and around 
South Korea and strengthen its domination and control over the 
Asia-Pacific region by using it. 
  Another purpose of the U.S. war-thirsty elements in stepping 
up arms buildup in South Korea is to turn it into its arms 
market and bring fabulous profits to the U.S. military 
monopolies. The U.S. ruling circles intend to make South Korea, 
its colony and military base, open its door wider as an arms 
market and drive out the puppets as a shock brigade in invading 
the North. 
  The United States must stop the reckless arms buildup going 
against the trend of the times toward disarmament and detente.

<F P=106> ["Important Peace Overture for Removing Danger of War" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The International 
Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea (Cilreco) 
expressed support for the statement released by the Foreign 
Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April 
28 proposing to the United States negotiations for a new peace 
arrangement. 
  In a statement May 2 Cilreco hailed and fully supported the 
important peace overture made by the DPRK to defuse 
confrontation and tension on the Korean peninsula and eradicate 
the danger of a war. 
  It urged the United States to affirmatively respond to the 
DPRK's important peace overture without delay and called on the 
regional and national committees of Cilreco, organizations for 
disarmament and peace and anti-war, anti-nuke peaceloving forces 
across the world to launch an extensive movement in support of 
the overture. 
  The Dar es Salaam Provincial Committee of the Tanzanian 
Youth 
Union in a statement May 1 said the United States has 
persistently rendered the situation of the Korean peninsula 
strained, violated the Korean Armistice Agreement and paralyzed 
the armistice supervisory machine for nearly half a century. 
  It demanded that the United States immediately put into 
effect the statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry, withdraw from 
South Korea at once, taking along more than 1,000 pieces of 
nuclear weapons and Patriot missiles, stop joint military 
exercises and come out to the talks with the DPRK. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea released a statement 
on May 3. 
  Noting that it has become an urgent matter to take practical 
steps for a durable peace on the Korean peninsula today when the 
Korean Armistice Agreement has been paralyzed, the statement 
strongly demanded that the United States accept the proposal of 
the DPRK Government unconditionally.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Foreign public figures 
have denounced the United States for threatening the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea with regard to "the nuclear issue." 
  Amaral Matos, first executive secretary of the Mozambican 
Committee for Friendship with the People of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea, released a statement on May 2 
charging that the United States has reinforced aggression 
forces, constantly bringing mass destruction weapons into South 
Korea. 
  Stating that a durable peace cannot be achieved in the world 
before the United States, a country stained with blood, is 
erased from the globe, he said: "The world must unite with 
each other and throttle and dismember the United States. [no 
closing quotation mark as received] 
  Shandrajeet Yadav, member of Parliament of India, 
co-chairman 
of the All India Peace and Solidarity Organization and 
vice-chairman of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity 
Organization, told KCNA on April 26 that the United States has 
escalated the plot to isolate and stifle the DPRK, crying for 
"special inspection" and "sanctions" under the unreasonable 
pretext of "nuclear suspicion." 
  Saying that to safeguard peace in Korea is a primary matter 
in defending peace in Asia and the rest of the world, he 
strongly urged the United States to stop arms buildup in South 
Korea and promptly withdraw its troops and weapons of all kinds 
from South Korea. 
  Don Borrie, chairman of the New Zealand-Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea Society, in a statement April 22 stressed that 
the New Zealand Government must not get involved in the 
swindles of the United States and the South Korean authorities 
but pursue an independent policy and maintain an anti-nuke stand.

  [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry answered 
a question put by KCNA reporter on 11 May on the U.S. efforts to 
force the Arab countries to lift their economic sanctions 
against Israel. His answers are as follows: 
  Making frequent visits to Mideast countries in late April 
and 
early May, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher put 
pressure on Arab countries to withdraw their economic sanctions 
against Israel. 
  However, a number of Arab countries are expressing their 
opposition and discontent [pulman] by maintaining the position 
of not withdrawing sanctions until the issues concerning the 
Mideast are comprehensively resolved. 
  We cannot but wonder about the United States' actions of 
trying to lift sanctions against Israel. It is no secret that 
Israel possesses nuclear weapons. The United States is trying 
to get economic sanctions on Israel, which threatens peace in 
the Middle East with nuclear weapons, lifted. However, the 
United States is blaring that sanctions will be taken against 
our country which has no nuclear weapons in actuality. This is 
a reversal of logic and an undisguised application of a double 
standard in international relations. 
  This contradictory act [mosunjogin haengwi] of the United 
States makes it plain that the nuclear issue over which it is 
raising a hue and cry is a fictitious invention for the sinister 
political aim of isolating and crushing [korip apsal haryonun] 
our republic. 
  The United States must not apply a double standard to the 
solution of international issues including the nuclear issue. 
  The world people should approach the unjust act of the 
United 
States which is trying to impose its unilateral assertion on 
others, ignoring the stand of the parties concerned, and styling 
itself as international policemen with high vigilance .

<F P=106> ["Who Is the Real Challenger" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Government 
authorities recently let out a string of ill-boding remarks, 
grossly getting on our nerves. 
  Prime Minister Hata, referring to the "suspected nuclear 
development" of the DPRK in his "policy speech" at the Diet on 
Tuesday, said "it is a challenge" and it goes against the 
"ideal" of Japan heading for "the final elimination of nuclear 
weapons." 
  Earlier, on Monday, Director General of the Defence Agency 
Kanda said in his inaugural "address" that "suspected nuclear 
development and missile development of North Korea are a 
challenge to the international community as a whole." 
  The very one who flung down the gauntlet against the entire 
international community is none other than the Japanese 
reactionaries who are gravely threatening peace and security in 
Asia and the rest of the world by speeding up nuclear arming and 
conversion of Japan into a military power. 
  It is Japan that has come into possession of nuclear bomb 
manufacturing elements including electronic destructive devices, 
and their technologies and started even the operation of 
"Monju", a fast breeder reactor, some time ago. 
  It is also Japan that caused deep apprehensions in the 
international community when it was learned recently that she 
had stockpiled 70 kgs of plutonium in the plutonium fuel plant 
beside the 26 tons stockpiled earlier. 
  Nevertheless, the Japanese Government authorities are 
raising 
a hue and cry over the "nuclear problem" of the DPRK, describing 
it as a "challenge". This is, in the final analysis, nothing 
but a crafty ruse to justify their own nuclear armament and 
moves to turn Japan into a military power.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Civic 
organizations of Japan denounced the unjustifiable search of and 
outrage against the Osaka organization of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by the 
Japanese police. 
  On April 28, members of the Minamiosaka solidarity society 
for peace and human rights comprising workers in Minamiosaka 
area conducted street propaganda in front of four government 
offices and distributed to citizens copies of a literature 
saying that the recent search can never be tolerated. 
  They said the search by the Osaka prefectural police was not 
an ordinary one but a "preliminary search" aimed at "freezing 
the property" of Koreans in Japan and "preserving public peace" 
in "case of emergency." 
  The chairman of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of the 
Japan Social-Democratic Party, Yukio Takemura, said in his 
recent statement that the search was a repressive act against 
Chongnyon perpetrated under the cloak of "investigation." He 
reaffirmed the resolution to struggle in solidarity with Koreans 
in Japan to defend their rights.

KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- An organization of 
Korean nationals in Russia sent a protest message respectively 
to the Japanese and South Korean Consulates General in Russia 
denouncing the South Korean traitorous clique and the Japanese 
reactionaries for scheming to drag Korean residents in Sakhalin 
into South Korea. 
  The message says the South Korean puppet authorities are 
hell 
bent on the deceptive propaganda to bring over fellow countrymen 
in Sakhalin, acting in the guise of "humanitarianism", in an 
insidious attempt to lay an anti-DPRK "foundation" in the Far 
Eastern region by winning them over and foment discord and 
consciousness of confrontation within the nation and thereby 
perpetuate division of the country and block the compatriots 
from advancing toward national reunification. 
  The South Korean authorities must renounce at once their 
anti- national, anti-reunification scheme to settle the issue of 
Korean residents in Sakhalin and other regions of the former 
Soviet Union with some money through conspiracy and tieup with 
the Japanese Government, and the Japanese authorities must no 
longer do acts obstructive to an independent reunification of 
Korea, it demands.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 12 (KCNA) -- Korean film studios have 
recently released many feature films of high ideological and 
artistic value. 
  The 17th and 18th parts of the multi-part feature film "The 
Nation and Destiny" recently released by the Korean film studio 
are showing at cinema houses throughout the country. 
  These parts of the film deal with the life of Ho Chong-suk 
who was a well-known woman political activist of Korea. 
  Born into a patriotic lawyer's family in Seoul, Kyonggi 
Province, she (the heroine of the film) joins in the communist 
movement as a girl. But she has to experience twists and turns 
for the absence of an illustrious leader. 
  The film gives a keen anatomy of the tragic situation of the 
early communist movement in the 1920s which was divided due to 
factional strife for leadership, and eloquently tells the truth 
that only under the guidance of a wise leader can a country lost 
to outside forces be retaken and the nation be saved as well. 
  Among the films released by the studio are "The General Clad 
in Red", the second part of "Japanese Invasion in 1592", a 
feature film about Kwak Chae-u of the aristocratic class origin, 
commander of the volunteers who organized volunteers with 
patriotic-minded average people, transcending the difference in 
caste, and valiantly fought the Japanese aggressors, and "Looks 
of a Party Member", a feature film showing a party cell 
secretary at a fertilizer factory. 
  The Korean February 8 film studio released a feature film 
"Political Commissar of the 8th Regiment" (two parts). 
  The film represents on an artistic canvas a historical 
occurrence in the mid-1970s out of the brilliant career of 
Comrade Kim Il, a staunch communist revolutionary fighter and 
prominent activist of the party and the state who remained 
unfailingly loyal to the party and the leader, to the country 
and people till the last moments of his life since he 
participated in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle under 
the guidance of the great leader President Kim Il- song. 
  It truthfully shows that loyal subjects are brought up in 
the 
bosom of a great leader and their lives are exalted in holding 
the leader in high esteem. 
  A feature film "The Daughter of Veterans" based on a story 
about a girl teacher who volunteers to be the daughter of a 
disabled veteran couple without anyone to rely on and looks 
after them with the utmost care, leaves deep impressions upon 
young men and women.

  [Text] A national meeting of propaganda functionaries of 
the Korea Democratic Women's Union [KDWU] was held in Pyongyang 
on 9-10 May. Functionaries of the KDWU Central Committee, KDWU 
propaganda functionaries of complexes in provinces, 
municipalities, and counties, and model junior KDWU propaganda 
functionaries attended the meeting. Discussions made in the 
meeting are the KDWU propaganda functionaries' tasks to 
contribute to actively accelerating the implementation of the 
chuche socialist cause by firmly uniting around the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Following a report by Kang Kwan-son, secretary of KDWU 
Central Committee, discussions were made at the meeting. 
  Reporters and debaters pointed out that the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song fully elucidated the programmatic tasks and 
plans so that all party members and working people could 
endlessly consummate the chuche revolutionary cause under the 
leadership of the dear comrade leader. 
  Stressing that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has 
victoriously led the revolution and construction with an 
extraordinary wisdom and outstanding leadership and, also, is 
the prominent man [wiin] who gained an immortal achievement that 
will shine forever in history, they said that today our party, 
people, and Army are safeguarding, adhering to, and glorifying 
the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style by 
upholding a slogan reading "The Whole Party, All People, and 
Entire Army Should Endlessly Consummate the Socialist Cause With 
Their Single-Hearted Unity." 
  They noted: Over the past years, KDWU organizations and 
propaganda functionaries have regarded it as the most important 
tasks in their ideological work to educate the union members so 
that they can uphold the party's leadership with their loyalty. 
They concretely proposed tasks to further strengthen the work. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: To adhere 
to the popular mass-centered socialism of our country and to 
brilliantly consummate the chuche revolutionary cause, the 
entire party and all people should properly uphold Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's leadership. Here lies the firm guarantee to 
inheriting and consummating the socialist cause. 
  The reporters and debaters said: KDWU organizations and 
propaganda functionaries at each level should strengthen 
ideological and indoctrination work so that the union members 
can absolutely admire and uphold our party based on their 
revolutionary faith and obligation. With various forms and 
methods, they should properly carry out the work of making the 
union members deeply grasp our party's greatness and immortal 
achievement by mobilizing and utilizing all ideological and 
indoctrination work systems of the union. 
  They stressed that thoroughly establishing the party's 
leadership system is the lifeline of the union's ideological 
work, as well as the basic principle for its activity, and 
pointed out that a firm discipline in which the union members 
act as one under the leadership of the party, as well as a 
revolutionary ethos in which the union members unconditionally 
and endlessly implement the party's line and policy should be 
established within the union. 
  They also said: All propaganda functionaries should make the 
union members deeply grasp the superiority and invincibility of 
socialism of our own style and should strengthen the 
indoctrination work to have them cherish a firm faith that the 
chuche socialist cause is certain of victory as long as there is 
our party's leadership. 
  Saying that the union members' success in the ideological 
and 
indoctrination work depends on the role of propaganda 
functionaries, who are directly in charge of it, the reporters 
and debaters stressed: All propaganda functionaries and junior 
functionaries should strongly arm themselves with our party's 
revolutionary ideology, set an example in their work and life, 
and practically carry out the management of junior 
functionaries' days. As a result, they should responsibly and 
actively carry out the propaganda and agitation work by raising 
their political and practical levels. 
  A letter of pledge to Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader 
of our party and people, was adopted at the meeting.

  [Text] Washington, May 10 (YONHAP) -- The United States and 
North Korea have made considerable progress on holding a third 
round of high-level talks despite thorny problems over the 
changing of nuclear fuel rods at Yongbyon, a U.S. Government 
official hinted Tuesday. 
  "North Korea had originally planned to begin changing 
nuclear 
fuel rods (at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon) on May 4, but 
so far there has not been any information that it has been 
carried out," said the official, who declined to be identified. 
  The reactor in question is an experimental one and therefore 
no technical difficulties are expected, even if the refueling 
plans are postponed, the official said. 
  "Pyongyang knows very well that U.S.-North Korean contacts 
will be broken off if it forces the changing of fuel rods 
without the presence of the IAEA (International Atomic Energy 
Agency)," he said. 
  The official, however, declined to discuss whether Pyongyang 
had informed Washington that it would delay its plans to change 
the fuel rods. 
  The United States and North Korea had a working-level 
contact 
in New York on Monday. Kenneth Quinones, the State Department's 
North Korea desk officer, represented Washington at the meeting. 
  Asked about the prospect for the third round of talks, the 
official said the United States is hopeful. 
  "We firmly hope that (dialogue on holding the talks) has 
reached the final phase," he noted. 
  Nevertheless, he said there would have to be many more 
working-level contacts, indicating a continued verbal tug-of-war 
between Washington and Pyongyang before the third round of talks 
could be realized. 
  The official said he believed that North Korea and the IAEA 
would "soon" resume negotiations. 
  "Once IAEA inspections begin, it would probably take about 
one week," he said, recalling that IAEA Secretary-General Hans 
Blix is expected to report back to the United Nations Security 
Council on the progress in the North Korean nuclear row by 
mid-May. 
  "The United States understands the technical position of the 
IAEA and is fully supporting the IAEA in that respect," he added.

  [Text] North Korea has clearly expressed that it will 
accept the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] proposal to 
send an additional inspection team to Pyongyang for inspections 
of a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon. 
  Kim Chong-su, deputy ambassador of the North Korean Mission 
to the United Nations, said today that, because they had already 
proposed that the IAEA send its inspectors to Pyongyang, they 
would accept them at any time. Also, he acknowledged, for the 
first time, that North Korea had not begun the work of replacing 
fuel rods at the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor. 
  Diplomatic sources in Washington said that North Korea has 
already issued visas for the IAEA inspectors to visit Pyongyang. 
They predict that IAEA inspectors will leave for Pyongyang this 
weekend and that they will conduct inspections early next week.

  [Text] Washington, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will likely conduct additional 
inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities at Yongbyon early 
next week since Pyongyang has already accepted the UN nuclear 
watchdog's request to send inspectors to complete checks at a 
radiochemical laboratory in the complex. 
  North Korea's Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations, Kim 
Chong-su, told YONHAP in a telephone interview Wednesday that 
his country welcomed nuclear inspectors anytime. 
  He confirmed publicly for the first time that the North has 
not gone ahead with refueling of the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor, 
which it had earlier threatened to do without IAEA supervision 
when the UN body demanded to take samples of spent fuel rods. 
  The IAEA director-general sent a telex to North Korean 
Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam on Tuesday proposing to send an 
inspection team to complete work at the nuclear reprocessiong 
plant in Yongbyon that was blocked during its previous visit in 
March. 
  The UN nuclear watchdog, however, made it clear that the 
communist country should delay removal of fuel rods from the 5- 
megawatt reactor until later this year. 
  Diplomatic sources in the U.S. capital said North Korea has 
already prepared visas for the IAEA inspection team and 
predicted that the inspectors would arrive in Pyongyang by this 
weekend and begin their task early next week. 
  Kim, in the telephone interview, offered assurances that the 
stalinist regime has not removed any spent fuel. 
  "We cannot delay removal of the spent fuel rods forever, for 
the sake of our safety, and we have to change the fuel rods 
because the situation is like a red light that is on in a car 
signaling it is running out of oil," he said. 
  Now that North Korea and the IAEA have settled their row 
over 
changing the fuel rods, Washington is expected to schedule a 
third round of high-level talks with Pyongyang after the 
additional nuclear inspections are carried out.

  [Text] Seoul has given Washington the go-ahead to hold a 
third round of U.S.-North Korea talks on condition that 
Pyongyang promises to delay the scheduled refueling at a 
Yongbyon reactor, a Foreign Ministry official said. 
  "Pyongyang's promise not to go ahead with the replacement of 
spent fuel rods will effectively remove a major hurdle for the 
third round of talks," he said. 
  As Pyongyang has already promised to accept an additional 
inspection at the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, its 
promise almost completely removes stumbling blocks to the 
long-delayed talks between the United States and North Korea, he 
added. 
  The second round of talks was held on July 11 last year in 
Geneva and the United States promised to support the replacement 
of North Korea's graphite moderated reactors with light water 
reactors which yield almost no plutonium usable for nuclear 
bombs. 
  Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
sent 
a telex to Pyongyang, notifying it that it would send inspectors 
in the next few days if the "core discharge campaign is 
deferred," according to a copy of the telex message obtained 
from the ministry. 
  "This team is to carry out the activities which the agency 
was not enabled to implement during the inspection in March at 
the reprocessing plant (radiochemical laboratory). It is 
further to perform such activities as the servicing of cameras 
and checking of seals," it added. 
  The international nuclear watchdog called on Pyongyang to 
allow "IAEA inspectors to select and secure for measurements 
later this year a representative sample of fuel rods." 
  Pyongyang has strongly opposed the sample-taking at the 
reactor, insisting it is not related to the continuity of 
safeguards. Therefore, the IAEA's flexibility on the timing of 
measurements is apparently designed to bypass Pyongyang's strong 
opposition for an early resolution to the nuclear issue. 
  The IAEA's telex can also be interpreted as a concession to 
North Korea because it said last week that it would not send an 
inspection team unless North Korea allowed experts to carry out 
full tests of the reactor's spent fuel. 
  Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry official said that the 
inspection of the 5-megawatt reactor will be further discussed 
at the third round of talks as insisted by Pyongyang. 
  However, he expressed a pessimism on the prospects of 
Pyongyang agreeing to complete inspections at the nuclear 
reactor, which is decisive to determining the state of the North 
Korean nuclear development program which started in 1986. 
  "If the IAEA succeeds in the inspection at the reactor, 
North 
Korea will completely lose all use of its nuclear card," he said. 
  So far, North Korea has made use of the "nuclear card" to 
secure concessions from South Korea and the United States. 
  He also denied the possibility that Pyongyang could go ahead 
with the refueling of the reactor without international 
supervision. 
  "In that case, Pyongyang would also lose the nuclear card 
because it would mean a complete breakdown of all 
nuclear-related talks, which would lead to U.N. sanctions," he 
said. 
  Therefore, South Korea and the United States are in the 
process of preparing another set of carrots and sticks to remove 
all doubts surrounding the North Korean nuclear weapons program.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yi Hong-ku, ROK deputy prime minister and </F>
minister of the National Unification Board, by senior CHUNGANG 
ILBO reporter Pak Chun-yong in Seoul on 10 May] 
  [Text] [Pak Chun-hyong] You designed the proposal of the 
Korean common race when you were the National Unification Board 
minister from 1988 to 1990. The present government has laid out 
a three-stage and three-principle policy represented by the 
following steps toward reunification: reconciliation and 
cooperation, alliance, and reunification. Are these two 
conceptions different? 
  [Yi Hong-ku] The Korean common race proposal and the 
reunification method based on the three-stage and 
three-principle policy are same in nature. 
  President Kim Yong-sam's mentioned the phrase "within the 
frame of the Korean common race" while announcing the 
reunification method in July 1993. As hinted by this, the 
government's reunification policy includes three separate steps 
to achieve the Korean common race. 
  In other words, the three steps are virtually included in 
the 
Korean common race and the government's reunification policy has 
made this clearer. 
  Accordingly, in spite of four years before I returned to the 
office of the unification minister, I can invariably push ahead 
with the reunification policy since it has not been changed at 
all. 
  [Pak] It sounds as if there has been no big change in the 
government's policy on North Korea. The new government 
attempted a fresh approach toward relations with North Korea. 
The opinions, however, have been divided into conservative and 
radical views as the nuclear issue was aggravated. How will 
you, as the minister of the National Unification Board, overcome 
this problem? 
  [Yi] There are two important things to think about. First, 
there were such big incidents as the collapse of the Soviet 
Union and the unification of Germany. They were not usual 
incidents. They mean the end of the age of ideology and doctrine 
that lasted for 100 years. As a result, we came to have the 
imminent task of solving the problem of the Korean peninsula, an 
outsider from the post-cold war stream of the world history, in 
a peaceful way, not by war. 
  In light of this point, we must, as soon as possible, free 
ourselves from the old dogmatic ideas not only in relations with 
North Korea, but also with the entire society. 
  Unfortunately, however, some of our younger generation, who 
are expected to be the most advanced, are still obsessed by the 
dogmatic ideology that prevailed in the early 20th century. 
  However, the lack of any definite plan in freeing oneself 
from dogmatism may result in a vacuum. Accordingly, 
civilian-led education on details of reunification is keenly 
required for creating a ripened civic sense in preparation for 
reunification. 
  Right after the World War II, the German Government also set 
aside a large budget for the people's political education 
programs to raise the people as mature civilians. 
  [Pak] Some people feel the government needs to adjust its 
North Korean policy after reevaluating the policy of linking 
South- North economic cooperation with the nuclear issue as no 
progress is being made in South-North relations because of the 
nuclear issue. 
  [Yi] I believe that the government's position is very 
reasonable. The problem is an order of priority. The 
government believes that there is nothing more important than 
the North Korean nuclear issue in present North-South relations. 
In other words, the government gives the highest priority to 
resolving the nuclear issue in its North Korean policy. This is 
because the nuclear issue is a matter of the nation's existence, 
not a matter of ideology. I do not mean, however, that the 
government will dogmatically interpret the meaning of the 
"settlement of the nuclear issue." It is not the position of 
the government to indefinitely delay the settlement of many 
North-South issues, including North- South economic cooperation, 
until the complete settlement of the nuclear issue. Nuclear 
transparency is a key factor in resolving the nuclear issue. We 
can say that in conformity with developments, the government has 
formulated a stage-by-stage plan to deal with North Korea, 
including North-South economic cooperation, on the assumption 
that the way to resolving the nuclear issue can be discovered in 
several months, instead of several years. 
  [Pak] It must be sure that Pyongyang's goal is to improve 
relations with Washington. People say that many problems -- 
including the nuclear issue and the easing of tensions on the 
Korean peninsula -- can be simultaneously solved only if the 
United States improves relations with North Korea. What do you 
say about this? 
  [Yi] The government has already formulated its policy based 
on such a direction. A few weeks ago, our government even 
withdrew its policy on the exchange of North-South special 
envoys. 
  Because there has been no progress in North Korean-U.S. 
talks 
as a result of our government's call for the exchange of special 
envoys, we could not but make a bold decision to withdraw it. 
This was not even thinkable in the past. Without the people's 
cooperation and their consciousness as citizens, this cannot be 
possible, either. However, the problem is North Korea's 
attitude. 
  The U.S. Government is well aware that North Korea wants to 
establish diplomatic relations, as well as to gain economic 
support from the United States. However, Pyongyang has not yet 
decided on its position on abandoning its nuclear development -- 
which it uses as a card for establishing diplomatic relations 
with the United States. 
  Finally, we can say the settlement of all the problems -- 
North- South dialogue, U.S.-North Korean relations, and North 
Korean- International Atomic Energy Agency relations -- depends 
on North Korea's choice. 
  The government's basic North Korean policy should be 
formulated in a direction in which it can be profitable to North 
Korea in the trends of world history. 
  [Pak] Some people think eliminating North Korea's 
distrust of the external world could be one of the means to 
change North Korea. 
  [Yi] North Korea's adjustment to the post-cold war era does 
not mean it has to become like South Korea. It will be rather 
closer to China. 
  If North Korea wants to readjust using the Chinese model, we 
will directly and indirectly help make the changes in a way that 
will not disgrace or burden North Korea. 
  [Pak] Regarding the repatriation of Yi In-mo after much 
dispute, although a survey by the National Unification Research 
Institute shows 79.2 percent of the people support the decision, 
some people think it was a mistake as North-South relations fell 
into a stalemate. 
  North Korea has recently demanded the repatriation of 
unconverted long-term prisoners Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. What 
is the government's position on this? 
  [Yi] The issue of unconverted long-term prisoners should be 
considered from various angles, not separately. Our people 
repatriated Yi In-mo on a humanitarian basis. 
  However, North Korea took him to every corner of the country 
and held people's rallies. That is not a humanitarian but 
political act under the excuse of humanity. 
  Furthermore, we also have 400 people who have been abducted 
to the North, including the 12 crew of the fishing boat 
Tongjin-ho, which was kidnapped in 1987. 
  As mentioned a few days ago by Kang Yong-hun, president of 
the South Korean Red Cross, our position is to make a package 
discussion covering all the pending humanitarian issues of the 
North and the South irrespective of the format, be it Red Cross 
talks or other talks. 
  [Pak] North Korea recently proposed to the United States to 
replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement. How 
would the government react to this? 
  [Yi] It contains a more strategical meaning aimed at 
blurring the focus of the nuclear issue. We look forward to 
responsible acts by North Korea. 
  We will adhere to the policy of resolving this issue through 
direct negotiations between the parties concerned in the South 
and the North. 
  Article 5 of the basic agreement between the South and the 
North stipulates that mutual efforts will be exerted to 
transform the armistice situation to a peaceful one, and that 
the current Armistice Agreement will be abided by until the 
advent of a peaceful situation. 
  [Pak] I understand that the government's decision to accept 
North Korean loggers is noteworthy because it was based on a 
policy to separately handle the regime and the people. Would 
the principle of differentiating the North Korean people from 
the regime be applied continuously in the future? 
  [Yi] Basically, North-South issues have a contradicting dual 
composition of a confrontation system and the efforts to resolve 
the confrontation through dialogue. The loggers issue is an 
example. 
  Therefore, the government plans to prudently solve the 
problem taking both the humanitarian aspect and North-South 
relations into consideration. It is true that this may sound 
like a contradiction. 
  I think politics is virtually to efficiently and reasonably 
lead such a contradictory situation.

  [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korean National 
Unification Board Minister Yi Hong-ku said Thursday that if 
North Korea developed "even one-half of a nuclear weapon," it 
would nullify the joint declaration of the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula signed on Dec. 31, 1991. 
  Speaking at a meeting of the Korean Newspaper Editors 
Association, Yi, who is also deputy prime minister, said the 
current military balance between South and North Korea and peace 
on the peninsula would be broken if the North came to possess 
nuclear arms. 
  The Seoul government cannot retract its policy of linking 
the 
nuclear issue with South-North economic cooperation until the 
dispute starts heading in the right direction, Yi said. 
  The government is nonetheless ready to respond to changing 
developments, Yi added, indicating that the policy of linkage 
could be flexible. 
  Commenting on a North Korean bid to replace the armistice 
agreement with a peace treaty with the United States, the 
minister said the government is trying to formulate measures on 
the move through consultations among concerned ministries. 
  "In any event, there is no change in the principle (of the 
Seoul government) that this problem has to be resolved between 
the two Koreas," he said. 
  In this respect, the United States is fully aware that 
inter- 
Korean accord is necessary to ensure peace and stability on the 
Korean peninsula, he added. 
  With regard to North Korean loggers fleeing from Siberia, Yi 
said there is no change in the government's policy of trying to 
help them settle in the South. 
  The problem should be handled quietly, however, so as not to 
irritate Russia and other countries involved, he said.

  [Text] Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of 
the National Unification Board, said that the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks are likely to be held next week when the 
International Atomic Energy Agency begins additional inspections 
of North Korea. 
  In a breakfast meeting with newspaper editors today, Deputy 
Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku predicted that positive progress 
[kungjongjogin chinjon] will be made in resolving the nuclear 
issue in the coming week and stressed: Although the replacement 
of fuel rods has been postponed, the sampling [sonjong], 
preservation [pogwan], and special measurement [tuksu kyechuk] 
of samples must be conducted without fail. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi said: The government will no longer 
emphasize the importance of holding South-North dialogue ahead 
of U.S.-North Korean talks [sonhu kwangye-e chipchakhaji anul 
kosimyo], and is now focusing on North Korea's guarantee of 
nuclear transparency in resolving the issue. 
  He stressed: The ROK and the United States firmly share the 
view that if North Korea possesses even half a nuclear weapon, 
it would be regarded as an act of nullifying the joint 
declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] It was learned that North Korea asked China to play 
the role of mediator for an early settlement of the nuclear 
issue. Western diplomatic sources in Beijing revealed that China 
accepted the North Korean request and is currently carrying out 
a behind-the- scene diplomatic role as mediator between the ROK, 
the United States, and North Korea. 
  This source revealed that last week North Korea conveyed to 
China its intention for an early settlement of the nuclear issue 
by means such as accepting nuclear inspections and holding the 
third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. At the same time, it conveyed 
to China that it wants to resume dialogue with the United 
States. It was learned that the Chinese side conveyed the 
position of the North Korean side to the U.S. side as well as to 
the ROK Government.

  [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- A Chinese minister in 
Seoul said Wednesday that Beijing opposes possession of nuclear 
weapons by both South and North Korea. 
  Minister Jie Qihua said in a speech to Buddhists here that 
China supports solution of the North Korean nuclear problem 
through inter-Korean dialogue and through talks between 
Pyongyang and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  "China supports South and North Korea and North Korea and 
the 
IAEA solving the nuclear problem patiently within the framework 
of bilateral dialogue," he said at a ceremony marking the second 
anniversary of the inauguration of the Buddhist Council for 
Peaceful Unification. 
  "China will fulfill its constructive role for peaceful 
settlement of the nuclear problem," he said. 
  However, he declined to comment on those North Koreans who 
have recently escaped from Siberian logging camps. 
  "It is difficult for me to comment on the issue because it 
is 
related to the difficult situation of the North Korean 
authorities." 
  Meanwhile, he emphasized that South Korea and China should 
further strengthen bilateral relations as partners in the 
Asia-Pacific era in the 21st century. 
  "The two nations have rapidly developed their bilateral 
relations since they formed diplomatic ties on Aug. 24, 1992. 
But they still have to strengthen bilateral cooperation in many 
fields, including the economy," he added.

  [Text] Recently, authorities of Yanji Municipal Public 
Security in China reportedly sent an official letter to 
Haninhoe, a group of some 300 South Korean companies in the 
Yanbian region, requesting that they not protect or help North 
Korean fugitives. 
  The reason for the PRC's relay of such a letter to South 
Korean companies may have been spurred by North Korea perhaps 
lodging a strong protest to the Chinese Government following 
rumors that South Korean companies are helping North Korean 
fugitives. 
  A South Korean Government official said on 8 May: "We have 
been informed by companies in Yanbian that the PRC sent a letter 
to Haninhoe requesting that they neither protect nor help North 
Korean fugitives, but concentrate on business."

  [Text] Seoul, May 11, IRNA -- Iran's oil minister, 
Gholamreza Aqazadeh, discussed his ministry's future 
construction and building plans with South Korean minister of 
construction affairs, Kim U-Sok, in Seoul Wednesday. The two 
sides expressed satisfaction over the cooperation in the field 
of construction and referred to the projects to manufacture oil 
tankers and gas compressors for Iran's gas industries as two 
successful examples of cooperation between the two countries. 
They also agreed to consider promotion of ties through exchange 
of information via visiting delegations. Aqazadeh also met with 
South Korea's minister of energy, trade and industries, Chulsu 
Kim, on Tuesday. 
  The two ministers voiced happiness on the expanding 
relations 
between Iran and South Korea especially on the purchase of 
Iranian oil by Korean refineries and carrying out of some 
projects in Iran's oil industries by Korean companies. They 
further expressed interest that South Korea would increase its 
purchase of Iranian liquid gas. 
  South Korea's increasing demand for Iran's crude oil and 
natural gas was also among the issues discussed in the meeting. 
Aqazadeh said that Iran was ready to continue to provide Korea 
with the crude oil. The Iranian oil minister arrived in Seoul 
Monday.

  [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu, addressing the whirlwind of change 
already sweeping the post-UR [Uruguay Round] world, has urged 
the public to rectify the constant lag in sensing such change. 
  He warned against new issues -- the environment, labor and 
competition policies -- becoming a new form of protectionism and 
vowed South Korea will pursue independent policies minimizing 
the trade accord's adverse impact while contributing to the new 
world order. 
  "The world is going through the process of becoming one 
market and one economy. This is the new reality," Han said in a 
luncheon speech to the Korean Council on Foreign Relations. 
  "Korea's domestic as well as external situations are 
changing 
at a breathtaking pace. Our perception should keep abreast of 
that pace but in many cases our perception is lagging behind," 
he told the council of senior and foreign diplomats in a speech 
titled "Post-UR International Order and Korea's Foreign Policy." 
  Unfortunately, South-North Korean relations are still 
calculated on a zero-sum game basis, but South Koreans must 
realize the new international order will be based on non 
zero-sum games. 
  In a comprehensive explanation of South Korea's position on 
major new issues, Han clarified what the country can and cannot 
accept. 
  On labor, for instance, South Korea has no reservations on 
improving protection of workers' basic rights. "And prisoner and 
child labor should be prohibited by all means," said Han. 
  But South Korea does have reservations about attempts to 
establish international standards, which "will hardly contribute 
to enhancing workers' rights nor is this practicable," the 
foreign minister said. 
  On competition policy, individual mechanisms considered 
unfair or restrictive -- monopolies, quotas, subsidies, 
countervailing and anti-dumping duties -- "should be reviewed on 
a case-by-case basis before judgement is passed," he said. 
  The foreign minister defended the government's decision to 
join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) by 1996, reasoning membership in the group will give 
Korea time to prepare its economy in advance. 
  But here again, South Korea will pursue independent 
policies. 
  South Korea's Official Development Assistance (ODA) level 
lags behind the requirement set by the OECD's Development 
Assistance Committee (DAC). 
  "Korea is considering wavering its membership in the DAC 
even 
if it joins the OECD by the year 1996," he said. 
  "Korea intends to comply with as many provisions as its 
economy can abide without serious disruption," he said. "And 
for the rest, Korea will present a reasonable schedule for 
liberalization."

  [Text] The government plans to ease foreign exchange 
regulations next month to liberalize current-account 
transactions to the level of advanced nations and capital 
movements to a lesser extent. 
  Restricted current-account transactions will be reduced from 
the current 109 categories of 61, the Ministry of Finance said 
yesterday. 
  The planned reduction of categories on the "negative list," 
from the current 109 to 61, will enhance the liberalization of 
current-account transactions to the level of members of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a 
grouping of advanced nations, the ministry said. 
  Of the 34 categories of current-account transactions 
requiring approval from the Bank of Korea, the ministry said, 
the central bank will entrust commercial banks with the 
authority to validate 25 categories. 
  The central bank will continue to retain the authority to 
approve nine categories of current-account transactions for fear 
that they may be exploited as channels of illegal foreign 
exchange out-flow, the ministry said. 
  Categories of current-account transactions requiring the 
approval of the Bank of Korea is rarely, if ever, permitted by 
the central bank, said an official from the ministry. 
  They include payments for overseas travel in excess of 
$5,000 
and remittances in excess of $5,000 as gifts, the ministry said. 
  Categories that will remain on the negative list include 
current-account transactions relating to gambling and drug 
trafficking, the ministry said. 
  The liberalization of capital movements, which will add 15 
new categories of capital movements to the "positive list" of 
103 categories of capital movements that can be conducted 
without the approval of the Bank of Korea, will ease 
restrictions on borrowing money abroad, the ministry said. 
  Domestic businesses will be allowed to borrow money abroad 
to 
finance their overseas advertisements, the ministry said. 
  Last year, domestic businesses spent $200 million in 
overseas 
advertisements, all of which was brought from their headquarters 
in the nation because of the regulations on capital movements, 
the ministry said. 
  The government will also permit domestic businesses to 
borrow 
money abroad to explore oil and other resources in foreign 
countries, the ministry said. 
  To borrow money abroad for such overseas projects, it said, 
domestic businesses are required to have those projects 
validated by their designated domestic banks. 
  Overseas branches and locally incorporated subsidiaries of 
domestic corporations will be allowed to borrow money abroad to 
make commissions or advance payments for their trades in 
overseas futures markets, the ministry said. 
  But the government will strengthen its supervision on 
overseas financing to prevent funds raised abroad from being 
brought into the nation, the ministry said. 
  Among the new 15 categories of capital movements that will 
no 
longer require approval from the central bank are debt-payment 
guarantees by domestic exporters to foreign importers seeking to 
borrow money from domestic banks, and loans provided in Korean 
won by a resident to a resident and payable in foreign 
currencies. 
  The central bank will entrust commercial banks with the 
authority to approve 13 of the 26 categories of capital 
movements that currently require approval from the central bank, 
the ministry said. 
  They include transactions conducted between residents and 
involving the movement of $100,000 or less, including the trade 
of bonds payable in foreign currencies, the ministry said. 
  The government will ease restrictions on the settlement of 
exports and imports, the ministry said. 
  Domestic exporters will be allowed to receive advance 
payments for their exports beyond the set limits on condition 
that excess advance payments are deposited with overseas 
branches of domestic foreign exchange banks, the ministry said. 
  Currently, the government restricts such advance payments to 
10 percent of the value of exports in the previous year for 
small- and medium-sized companies and 3 percent for large 
corporations. 
  The government is restricting advance payments on the 
grounds 
that they are no different from bank loans from abroad, the 
ministry said. 
  In view of growing bilateral trade and exchanges between 
Korea and China, the ministry said, the Korean government will 
add the Chinese currency to the list of "designated foreign 
currencies" for freer conversion into and from the Korean 
currency. 
  The government will no longer distinguish 589 Class A 
foreign 
exchange banks, permitted to engage in all types of foreign 
exchange business, from 2,009 Class B foreign exchange banks 
which are restricted to domestic foreign exchange business, the 
ministry said. 
  Banks will be allowed to choose foreign exchange business 
areas for their branches on their own discretion, the ministry 
said. 
  The government will allow resident individuals to buy 
foreign 
currencies within the limit of their foreign currency sales 
during the previous three months, the ministry said. 
  But the daily limit to foreign currency purchases by the 
same 
person will be $50,000, the ministry said, adding that 
individuals will be allowed to hold an unlimited amount of 
foreign currencies on condition that they report foreign 
currency holdings in excess of $450,000 to their foreign 
exchange bank.

writer: "Dangers of Power Diplomacy Under the Banner of `the 
Asian Age'"] 
  [Text] What Awaits in the Future After Hosokawa's "No" 
  Mass media commentary applauding "Prime Minister 
Hosokawa for saying `No'"is conspicuous. Although it is said 
that Japan-U.S. relations have entered a new phase, we probably 
should exercise caution over distorted nationalism and 
ill-founded pan-Asianism emanating from attempts by Japanese to 
extricate themselves from pent-up anti-U.S. sentiments and 
reactionary behavior. 
<H5>  Sense of Satisfaction in Dispelling Resentment by Having </H5>
Said "No" 
  A change of direction is under way. 
  The direction in which Japan is proceeding is undergoing a 
bold change at least in the area of diplomacy as it nears the 
50th anniversary of the end of World War II. 
  What is visible to the eye may be insignificant. If one were 
to inquire at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], the likely 
response will be, "We are merely following the basic policies of 
the past." However, if we were to piece together the fragments 
of recent events, we note an obvious meandering of diplomatic 
actions. 
  In succinct terms, those events can be termed "a shift from 
the United States to pan-Asianism." 
  "I felt a sense of satisfaction as though dispelling a 
grudge 
in the prime minister's `No.' It was tantamount to declaring 
independence and I would like to applaud his move without 
reservation... I felt much satisfaction in that he made the 
statement with the firmness that should be displayed whenever 
making an initial remark like that." 
  "I felt satisfaction, sensing that the virtual breakdown of 
Japan-U.S. negotiations signaled initiation of a new age in 
Japan-U.S. relations... I would like see a resolve that refuses 
to retreat from the new trend." 
  The foregoing quotes were extracted from letters sent by 
readers to the editor of newspapers published after the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks in Washington on 11 February. The first 
quote was from a letter sent to the MAINICHI SHIMBUN by a 
76-year-old businessman. The second quote was from a letter sent 
to the ASAHI SHIMBUN by a 68-year-old housewife. Both were 
published on 18 February. 
  Those letters to the editor are a direct reflection of the 
Japanese mass media commentary following the breakdown of the 
negotiations. 
  Just a while back, if Japan-U.S. negotiations had been 
broken 
off, that alone would have caused the resignation of the cabinet 
or the prime minister. The situation would have met with a 
barrage of criticism. However, this time around, even though it 
was not labelled "a job well done," there is an attitude that 
the situation was handled logically. The ASAHI SHIMBUN editorial 
started with the comment, "It was a summit meeting which gave a 
vivid sense that a new phase of Japan-U.S. relations has been 
launched under a leader of the new age," while the YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN editorial read, "It is said that mature diplomatic 
relations at times require `an agreement to disagree.'" 
  An erstwhile proponent of "let's say `No'" to the United 
States was House of Representatives member Shintaro Ishihara. 
About four years ago when The Japan That Can Say No, 
which he co-authored with Sony Chairman Akio Morita, was 
released, the majority of mass media commentary was critical. 
The ASAHI SHIMBUN criticized the book, saying, "The book can 
hardly be considered representative of Japanese opinion," while 
Shizuoka Prefecture University professor Terumasa Nakanishi, in 
the magazine CHUO KORON denounced the book as "barber shop 
political talk." However, now it seems as if The Japan 
That Can Say No has gained widespread recognition as the 
prevailing sentiment. 
  Needless to say, we cannot place the contents of The 
Japan That Can Say No and Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
position of "No" in the same category. Mr. Ishihara's assertions 
are fragmentary, full of errors, and replete with 
sensationalism. Prime Minister Hosokawa had said "No" to the 
idea of setting numerical goals for specific trade categories 
such as automobiles as proposed during six months of Japan-U.S. 
trade negotiations. And European and U.S. mass media expressed 
understanding of Japan's opposition to the establishment of 
numerical goals. 
  However, I believe both Mr. Ishihara's "No" and Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's "No" hit the public with identical 
psychological impact. I say this because Messrs. Ishihara and 
Morita's book sold an astounding 1.2 million copies. In his 
follow-up book titled, The Japan That Can Still Say 
`No', he says, "It is a very unusual situation where a book 
sells 1 million copies and that no doubt demonstrates that there 
was a social necessity for the book." Whether the book was a 
"social necessity" is beside the point, but it is obvious that 
public sentiment--which had been daunted by wanton U.S. 
manipulation of the Japanese Government--was imbued with a sense 
of emancipation. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa's "No" had the same impact. As 
reflected in the letters to the editor, the public was hit by a 
sense of delight by a statement of "No" to the United States 
which had somehow seemed to keep Japan under a state of 
oppression. There seems to be a common quality between that 
situation and the words of Tetsutaro Kawakami who wrote 
immediately following the opening of the Japan-U.S. war, "I can 
now relax with a genuine sense of emancipation." 
<H5>  Revenge Emanating From Anti-U.S. Sentiment </H5>
  Whether the news is good or bad, the mass media and public 
sentiment seem to move in unison. If that were not the case, the 
newspapers would not print letters to the editor of that nature. 
On the other hand, if the public had not sensed the change in 
the mass media's posture, readers probably would have not 
written and sent letters like that. Now, the question is why has 
the mass media, which four years ago frowned upon the word "No," 
capitulated to and joined in a chorus of approbation? 
  We can picture a variety of reasons. As often mentioned, the 
Cold War structure has collapsed and coordination of economic 
matters has become the foremost concern in bilateral relations. 
Even during President Bush's tenure, the United States 
approached Japan somewhat high-handedly. Now that the Clinton 
administration has positioned economic recovery as the 
foundation for the security and growth of the United States, it 
gives the impression that it is willfully bullying Japan without 
any concern for obvious appearances. 
  An issue of foremost importance during the past four years 
was the Gulf war. The Gulf war served to display differences in 
the public's perception of international and security matters in 
Japan and the United States. Of special note is that the 
Japanese people, who contributed $13 billion through increased 
taxation, were inflicted with deep psychological wounds when 
hardly any appreciation was expressed and were contrarily 
ridiculed for "checkbook diplomacy." It just may be the case 
that such resentment has taken the form of "anti-U.S." 
sentiments and is deeply rooted in the hearts of the general 
public. 
  On the other hand, there is an energetic cry for restoration 
of absolute values in the United States. Allan Bloom's 
Closing of the American Mind and Arthur Schlesinger's 
The Disuniting of America and Samuel P. Huntington's 
treatise, Clash of Cultures which recently captured 
literary recognition all treat European and U.S. value standards 
as a universal force, projecting a conspicuous move to abandon 
the doctrine of relativity concerning cultural-anthropological 
issues. The revisionist movements which were extremely popular 
during the latter half of the 1980's serve to reinforce 
journalistic trends of this nature. It may be that Japan is 
witnessing the birth of psychological reaction to distance 
itself from the United States in response to fear, doubt, and 
resistance to such journalistic trends. 
  Some may rebut that "alienation from the United States is an 
exaggeration." But, as the $60 billion surplus with the United 
States demonstrates, Japan is dependent upon the United States 
in a major way in the area of trade. Japan's defense is 
integrated with the United States in terms of policy, weapons 
systems, and, if one exists, in terms of strategy. You might say 
that it is unrealistic to even think of Japan extricating itself 
from U.S. influence. 
  However, because those are the facts and because the impulse 
is unrealistic, Japanese people want to separate themselves from 
the United States in the world of fantasy. They say that 
"feelings of dispelling a grudge" and "feelings of satisfaction" 
may have originated from such thoughts. 
<H5>  In the Name of Pan-Asianism </H5>
  However, we now begin to hear subtle voices saying, "No. 
Shouldn't we think of such an approach with seriousness." 
Instead of speaking of cautious separation from the United 
States, rather, those arguments call for widely addressing 
Japan-U.S. cooperation, while inspiring nationalism on the part 
of the public. One that need not be mentioned is Shinseito 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's "A Normal Nation" theory and 
another is former MOFA Economic Affairs Bureau director Kazuo 
Ogura's Asian theory. 
  In the article "An Idealistic Empire and Fissure of a Lost 
Civilization," published in 1991 in GAIKO FORUM, Mr. Ogura 
attempted a profound psychological analysis of Japan-U.S. 
friction from a perspective which differs from revisionists. He 
said, "From the U.S. viewpoint, Japanese become Americans as 
soon as it is said that Japan shares American values. They say 
Japanese should behave in the same manner as Americans... in 
fact, must behave in the same manner. On the other 
hand, many Japanese feel that the U.S. approach to Japan in 
substance is based on the idea that Japan is nothing more than a 
spiritual colony of the United States, denies the Japanese way 
of life, and violates the basic principle of international 
friendship." 
  Mr. Ogura published a paper titled "For the Restoration of 
Asian Authority" in the July 1993 edition of the CHUO KORON, 
calling for revival of the Asian ethos. He stipulates that Asia 
was "created" in a self-seeking manner by Europe and the United 
States as a target of exploitation, confiscation and cultural 
reorientation. He then writes, "We now face the issue of how we 
will overcome ardent nationalism, which accompanied European 
modernization, as we approach the 21st century, the issue of how 
we will control the Faustian characteristics of mechanical 
culture centered around the search for unlimited desire and 
insatiable self-assertions, as well as the issue of realizing 
genuine harmony between the natural environment and human 
lifestyles. I wonder if the time has come when it is necessary 
to activate traditional "Asian" ethos in addressing such issues." 
  Needless to say, the Ogura thesis was not officially 
recognized by the MOFA. The principal forces in the ministry 
still believe in a close Japan-U.S. alliance. However, the 
treatise does have more than a minor appeal to young bureaucrats 
of the ministry. There are two reasons. First, the treatise is 
novel in that it sets aside technical debate on security and 
economic policies and focuses on cultural aspects. Second, the 
young generation is disgusted with negotiations with the United 
States that are fraught with problem issues. In contrast, Asian 
countries which have been blessed with pleasant, rapid progress 
in economic interchange are far more appealing duty stations. It 
appears they are attracted to the Ogura treatise which justified 
"a drift from the United States to pan-Asianism" on the basis of 
such unrealistic desires. 
  Considering that such conditions exist in the MOFA, it is 
easy to visualize the situation in other ministries. 
  At one time, fiscal officers of the MOF and trade 
counsellors 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
comprised a pro-U.S. stronghold. As a pattern visible in former 
trade counsellor Naohiro Amaya and former fiscal officer Makoto 
Uchimi, these individuals were acquainted with the United States 
and U.S. leaders based on assignments to the embassy and 
legations in the United States in their younger days and advised 
the government, from a comprehensive perspective if put in a 
positive way and from a pro-U.S. position if put in a negative 
way. However, that tradition is about to crumble. 
  Pro-U.S. elements are definitely decreasing in both 
ministries. Just like the situation in the MOFA, young 
bureaucrats at the MOF and MITI prefer assignment to the Asian 
countries rather than the United States. Even the director of 
the Americas Department of MITI has no experience serving in the 
United States. It was even rumored that the episode in which 
former Industrial Policy Bureau director Masahisa Naito of MITI 
was reassigned represented a move to expel pro-U.S. elements. 
  The recent breakdown in Japan-U.S. negotiations was not only 
a reflection of lack of leadership skills on the part of Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, but was probably not unrelated to such 
indifferent attitudes towards the United States and the trend to 
drift from the United States among young bureaucrats. In 
essence, they consider negotiations with the United States as 
only one aspect of the total situation and lack the zeal to 
succeed in negotiations with the United States regardless of 
cost as was the case with their predecessors. And, they mutter 
indiscriminately , "If we can't make a deal with the United 
States, there's Asia." 
  There's probably no need to make another introduction of Mr. 
Ozawa's book, Blueprint for Building a New Japan. In 
that book, he seeks concentration of power relative to internal 
government affairs and externally seeks a "strong Japan" 
stressing international contributions including those of a 
military nature. 
  Mr. Ozawa's foreign policy emphasizes a Japan-U.S. alliance 
and the Asia-Pacific region. These principles are clearly 
enunciated in "The Five Guiding Principles of Japanese 
Diplomacy." It appears that in this respect, there is no change 
whatsoever in policies between the Liberal Democratic 
Party-controlled government and the current government which 
inherited them. Notwithstanding, the Ozawa theory has been 
welcomed enthusiastically by MOFA bureaucrats, especially young 
bureaucrats, as being epochal in nature. The question is, why? 
  One reason is that Mr. Ozawa's "normal nation" tenet 
incorporates the qualities aspired to by Japanese diplomats who 
have engaged in diplomacy lacking authority. Mr. Ozawa defines a 
normal nation as one that "engages in normal activities in 
international society as if they were commonly accepted actions 
in a responsible manner.... We should not insist on assertions 
that are acceptable only in Japanese society and never 
reluctantly engage in activities only because of international 
pressure." You might say that MOFA bureaucrats basically support 
Mr. Ozawa because he, in a way, spoke for them by saying what 
they wished to say but hesitated to say. However, was that the 
total picture? 
  In fact, Blueprint for Building a New Japan 
contains a viewpoint which is similar to the Ogura treatise. 
Ozawa wrote, "The basic tenet of Western values which influenced 
the world in the past calls for the conquest and control of 
nature by mankind. Science and technology were developed as 
tools to be used in pursuit of that goal... However, mankind is 
now faced with the need to cope with the environmental problems 
arising from mankind's actions. In other words, the basic issue 
of the environment concerns the issue of human `lifestyles.' 
Mankind is faced with the need to convert from the Western value 
of controlling the environment to Eastern values in which 
mankind coexists as one part of nature." Those words are 
amazingly similar to those of Mr. Ogura. And, it is this very 
ex-Western value that serves as motivation for MOFA bureaucratic 
appeal for Mr. Ozawa. 
<H5>  The Dangers of Treading an "Old Path" </H5>
  My comments may invite the criticism that I am 
overemphasizing the critical issues, but even if there are signs 
that that is the case, any attempt to stipulate the formation of 
Japan's future course may be scorned as reflecting a fragile 
basis. However, when such books and treatises become popular 
among bureaucrats and influence the venting of resentment of the 
United States by the public, one wonders if we can merely laugh 
off any seemingly groundless fears that such minor signs of 
potential problems could become a torrent. 
  I do not say that distancing oneself from the United States 
is wrong. And, there is no reason to declare that a return to 
Asia is dangerous. The Soviet Union has undergone a fragile 
collapse and the United States remains as the single superpower. 
And the United States has no intention of abandoning its 
singular position as the only world military power. On the other 
hand, it is attempting abrasive intervention in other nations in 
an effort to recover strength in its ailing economy. 
  That fact casts a very serious problem on Japan, which can 
be 
called the foremost beneficiary of the Cold War structure. It is 
not strange that a movement has surfaced in an effort to 
establish an identity for Japan. 
  However, both Mr. Ozawa's and Mr. Ogura's arguments reflect 
a 
degree of fantasy and omission of historical facts. The fantasy 
consists of associating all modern evils with conversion to 
Euro-American and modern ethos, and an infatuation with vague 
Eastern values. The historical omission covers the desperate 
struggles by our previous generation to "leave Asian society and 
assimilate into European society" and the process under which 
there was a rise in pan-Asianism and ultranationalism in an 
attempt to conceal the conflicts arising from those struggles. 
  For a time after the defeat in World War II, progress was 
made in an intellectual effort to thoroughly expose efforts at 
modernizing Japan, pan-Asianism, nationalism, and 
ultranationalism. Intellectuals such as Ko Takeuchi, Masao 
Maruyama, and Bunzo Hashikawa researched the topics with 
extraordinary pain. However, during the high-growth period, 
intellectuals neglected any effort to continue such research. 
The likes of Mr. Ogura neglect to examine the remains of such 
research as if they were so much rubbish. 
  Modern ministries and agencies of the central government are 
staffed with middle managers who enjoy the entertaining features 
of comics rather than building a foundation in theory. It is 
said that we now see increasing numbers of bureaucrats who 
fantasize about diplomacy and politics that "stir the 
imagination" in a manner akin to animated comic strips. I am 
vaguely apprehensive to see the proliferation of simple logic 
which run the risk of implanting additional fantasies in the 
minds of such bureaucrats.

  [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN, in cooperation with Gallup 
Organization Inc., conducted in March the 11th opinion poll 
covering five nations (Japan, the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Germany, and France), and surveyed how those countries 
place trust in one another. The United States has been the most 
trustworthy nation for Japan since 1978, but the percentage of 
trust has fallen below 50 percent for the first time in 12 
years. In addition, 20 percent of people in both Japan and the 
United States cited the other country as a potential military 
threat, displaying a swing in the sense of trust by citizens of 
both nations. The survey demonstrated anew that one of the most 
crucial problems confronting the cabinet of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata is to restore Japan-U.S. relations which have been 
strained by trade friction. The trade issue appears to have 
chilled the feelings Japanese and Americans have for each other. 
Japan was the most important nation for U.S. economic 
interests, third for British, German, and French economic 
interests, but was judged the 13th most trustworthy nation in 
the United States, the 10th in the United Kingdom, and the 11th 
in Germany and France. Moreover, according to a U.S. opinion 
poll complied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 29 April, 
the trust that the Americans place in Japan has clearly declined 
to the lowest level in the last 20 years. 
  Asked to pick five nations from a list of 31 they considered 
the most trustworthy, 45 percent of Japanese respondents placed 
the United States at the top. However, the figure showed a drop 
of 6 percentage points from the previous survey conducted in 
1992, falling below the 50 percent mark for the first time in 12 
years (a 1982 poll recorded 49.6 percent). The degree of 
Japanese trust in the United States has been on the decline 
since the start of the 1990's because of worsening bilateral 
economic friction, but Japan's backlash against the 
administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton for its pressure 
to open Japanese markets seems to have rebounded as seen in the 
poll. 
  In terms of how others see Japan, 10 percent of those 
surveyed in the United States said Japan was trustworthy, two 
percentage points more than the record low recorded in 1992 and 
the second lowest since the polls began. 
  Japan obtained low marks in the survey on its 
trustworthiness 
as viewed by Europeans, scoring 12 percent (11th) in the United 
Kingdom, 18 percent (10th) in Germany, and 17 percent (11th) in 
France. In a similar query, Japanese respondents had a higher 
evaluation of these countries, giving the United Kingdom 40 
percent (second), Germany 27 percent (fourth), and France 26 
percent (fifth). 
  However, the perception that Japan is economically important 
has filtered down to the countries where the survey took place. 
Japan sharply outdistanced Canada and the European Union as the 
nation most important to U.S. economic interests, gaining the 
top position with 53 percent. It also placed third in the 
United Kingdom, Germany, and France. In Japan, the United 
States overwhelmed other countries with 82 percent. 
  Fifty-six percent of Japanese respondents put North Korea at 
the top of the list of nations that could become a military 
threat to their country, while the Middle East topped all others 
as an area that could become a military threat to the United 
States, the United Kingdom, and France. The former Soviet Union 
occupied first place in the survey in Germany. In addition, 21 
percent of respondents in Japan listed the United States while 
20 percent of the Americans cited Japan. 
  Regarding Japan's economic clout in the 21st century, the 
predominant feeling is that it has reached its zenith since 39 
percent of Japanese respondents said the economy will not change 
and 31 percent said it will become weaker, outnumbering 25 
percent who said it will become stronger. However, respondents 
in the United States and the three European countries said the 
Japanese economy will grown stronger since they apparently see 
it as a primary factor pressuring their own economies.

  [Text] The Hata government has made a full-fledged start 
after Prime Minister Hata delivered his policy speech to the 
Diet on 10 May. In handling the economy, the Hata government is 
likely to focus on resuming the stalled Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks in May and reforming the current tax system in 
June. The fragile Hata government, which abruptly finds itself 
standing at a crucial juncture, is frantically looking for a 
breakthrough. The prime minister and other officials are making 
full contacts with U.S. Government officials in an effort to 
resume the stalled framework talks, and they intend to resume 
the stalled framework talks during May, at the earliest. Moves 
are afoot within the government to study the possibility of 
reforming the current tax system in a way that is acceptable to 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. What holds the key 
is whether the Hata government can coax the SDPJ and other 
political parties into supporting its reform program for the 
current tax system in line with the prime minister's 
"cooperative" policy that attaches importance to dialogue with 
opposition parties. 
  The government is committed to mapping out a package of 
concrete measures in June to open the Japanese market, and key 
elements of the package will be the tax system reform, addition 
to the planned amount for public works projects, and 
deregulation. The government will have to map out the package 
just prior to the summit talks of industrialized nations (Naples 
summit) in July. The Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry believes that if the government maps out a halfway 
package, "it would undercut Japan's effort to patch up relations 
with the United States and adversely affect the Naples summit." 
  The Finance Ministry says with a strong sense of crisis, "If 
the package falls short of meeting U.S. demands, it would worsen 
Japan- U.S. relations and the United States would increase 
pressure on Japan to further appreciate the yen, throwing cold 
water on Japan's economy." In his policy speech to the Diet, 
Prime Minister Hata stressed that he would work on mapping out 
the package. 
  With regard to the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks, the prime minister conversed by telephone with President 
Clinton on 9 May and an idea is abruptly surfacing within the 
government to send a vice ministerial official to the United 
States. The government intends to study how to respond to the 
U.S.-proposed objective criteria after confirming the real 
intent behind the U.S. proposal. The government plans to resume 
the stalled framework talks after Foreign Minister Kakizawa 
meets with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor during the 
ministerial talks of the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development (OECD) scheduled for June. 
  In the tax system reform, the government calls cutting the 
income tax and raising the consumption tax a "national task," 
and there are moves to explore ways for holding tax system 
reform discussion with the government, ruling coalition parties, 
the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and the SDPJ participating. 
The idea is surfacing within the government's Tax System 
Research Council to study the possibility of adopting a plural 
tax rate system that holds down the consumption tax rate on 
food, which the SDPJ has long advocated. The government is 
revealing its posture to get the LDP and the SDPJ participate in 
the tax system reform discussion. 
  Some are saying in whispers that once a budget bill for the 
fiscal 1994 is enacted, the mood for dissolving the House of 
Representatives and holding general elections would grow, thus 
destabilizing the political situation. If the general elections 
are set to held, there would be moves to defer the tax system 
reform. Therefore, it fears that the Hata government would face 
an impasse in handling the economy.

  [Text] 1. It is important to have economists reaffirm their 
opposition to numerical targets. Even though some observers 
claim the United States will not use them as the basis for 
punitive sanctions, we cannot be sure that will be true. 
  2. There is no good reason why Japan should be in a hurry to 
reopen comprehensive trade talks. The U.S. trade strategy is 
under attack at home. An easy compromise was rendered moot by 
the failure of U.S.-Japan summit talks in February. Japan must 
deal constructively with U.S. complaints based on the principle 
of "equal opportunity." Some U.S. complaints, however, should be 
rejected without compromise. In this era of distrust, a debate 
over setting "targets" would be pointless. 
  3. Japan should urgently embark upon a program of 
much-needed 
deregulation, fend off external criticisms by announcing 
substantial market-opening measures, and enter into bilateral 
negotiations such as the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) 
with the United States. Japan must also make a positive 
contribution to the establishment of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). 
<H5>  EU Also Opposes Numerical Targets </H5>
  Immediately before the U.S.-Japan summit meeting on 12 
February, 154 Japanese economists made a public appeal to the 
United States to withdraw its demand for numerical targets, and 
to Japan to firmly resist numerical targets (see NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN 28 January 1994). This appeal was made directly to both 
leaders as well. 
  Last fall, U.S. economists, including several Nobel prize 
winners, published an open letter addressed to both leaders 
which said very much the same thing. I believe that it is safe 
to say that nearly all Japanese and American economists are 
strongly opposed to U.S. Government demands for numerical 
targets. Not only do numerical targets place the burden of proof 
on Japan while placing the United States in the judgment seat, 
they also distort trade between the world's first and second 
largest economies. Economists have appealed to both sides to 
conduct bilateral trade negotiations according to economic 
principles. 
  I am not sure whether our appeal influenced the result of 
the 
summit meeting, but Japan was able to avoid becoming an 
accomplice in managed trade by rejecting numerical targets. 
Moreover, the failure of the U.S.-Japan summit bolstered the 
opinion in Europe and the United States that Japan had "rejected 
managed trade and upheld the principles of free competition." 
Strangely enough, the Japanese decision actually helped to shape 
public opinion. Japan is widely believed to have won a tactical 
victory by taking the high road and appealing to concise 
principles. This is but one example of the importance of 
tackling international trade disputes with easy-to-understand 
principles. 
  After the failure of the summit, however, share prices fell 
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the yen rose sharply against the 
dollar on international financial markets. These occurances were 
fueled by a sense of uncertainty. The U.S. Government, moreover, 
immediately resurrected Super 301 (the authority to name and 
sanction unfair trading nations) in order to increase the 
pressure on Japan. Many in Japan began to call for a compromise 
with the United States. But did the failure of the summit 
disadvantage Japan? Was our advice concerning numerical trade 
targets wrong? 
  I do not believe so. The United States and Japan are 
currently going through a necessary period of adjustment as they 
move toward a more constructive, long-term economic 
relationship. There is not much that we can do about the 
intermediate tensions that are part of this process. Over the 
long run the extremely high yen will reduce our current account 
surplus, but in the short term it will cause our trade surplus 
to expand. This phenomenon is known as the "J-Curve." Japan-U.S. 
relations are experiencing a political J-Curve at the present 
time. It is important to be patient. 
  In order to restart comprehensive trade talks, some Japanese 
analysts appear to be advocating a "policy of compromise." One 
such group has proposed "voluntary goals" to get individual 
corporations to purchase more U.S. manufactured goods. Another 
group recommends "macroeconomic targets" aimed at reducing the 
overall current account surplus. These analysts would like to 
see U.S. demands satisfied by July. Various ideas have been 
proposed in Japan, and U.S. Government officials in Washington 
have expressed keen interest in this "policy of compromise." 
<H5>  Macroeconomic Targets, Procedures Unclear </H5>
  However, there are two major strategic errors in the 
arguments of the "compromise faction." First, the United States 
will view "voluntary goals" as "numerical targets" no matter how 
it is presented and will use them as the basis for sanctions. At 
the very least, these "voluntary goals" can be used as a pretext 
for Super 301 if they are not met, or if anti-Japanese sentiment 
intensifies. "Voluntary goals" were incorporated into the 
semiconductor agreement and were again promised for automobile 
and automotive parts imports during President George Bush's 
January 1992 state visit to Japan. In both cases, the United 
States used them as the basis for sanctions to coerce Japan into 
meeting the goals. This despite the fact that Japan considered 
them "voluntary goals." 
  In the revised semiconductor agreement of 1991, a foreign 
semiconductor target of 20 percent of the domestic market was 
explicitly stated in the text. However, the text of the 
agreement also stated that this goal "would not be used as the 
object of sanctions should it fail to be reached." In spite of 
this provision and significant progress under the agreement, 
sanctions were threatened when foreign semiconductors failed to 
reach the 20 percent mark by the 31 December 1992 deadline. 
  The United States will not care if they are only "voluntary 
goals." Today's compromise will undoubtedly become a source of 
conflict tomorrow. 
  The second problem with the "policy of compromise" is that 
it 
encourages the mistaken opinion among some in the United States 
that Japan will always compromise if enough pressure is brought 
to bear. At meetings within the U.S. administration, the 
hardline faction advocates use of the threat of sanctions to 
force Japan to accept a comprehensive agreement by the time of 
the G-7 summit in July (the second deadline). They remain 
steadfastly opposed to the more conciliatory faction which 
considers U.S. demands to be unreasonable. News that unease is 
growing in Japan and that a compromise is being considered would 
only embolden the hardliners. Despite the fact that these goals 
were "voluntary," they would end up serving as a U.S. strategic 
weapon. The policy of compromise would only complicate matters 
by encouraging the hardliners. If this were to happen, it would 
become impossible to say "no" at the upcoming summit. 
  As for macroeconomic targets, those who propose them must 
clarify their goals and procedures. More important than the 
result (a reduction in the current account surplus) are the 
political steps for bringing it about. For example, if the goal 
were to bring the current account surplus down under 2 percent 
of GNP within three years, proponents would have to indicate who 
would be responsible. This would be especially difficult to 
assign considering the volatility of the yen on exchange markets 
and the demand created for several trillion yen by the addition 
of public corporations. Didn't advocates of reducing the current 
account surplus below 2 percent of GNP welcome the appreciation 
of the yen after negotiations failed? 
  Some advocates of macroeconomic numerical targets believe 
they would obviate the need for microeconomic numerical targets 
or at least reduce pressure on the microeconomic level. I 
believe they are wildly optimistic. While Japan did not accept 
numerical targets in the agreement reached at the opening of 
comprehensive talks last July, it did agree to reduce its 
current account surplus "substantially." The Japanese Government 
used macroeconomic targets as a jumping-off-point, but did not 
have the power to change microeconomic behavior. 
  In addition, the U.S. purchasing targets for automobiles and 
automotive parts are not realistic. The quality of Japanese 
automobiles and the lack of effort on the part of U.S. 
automobile manufacturers are beyond dispute. Privately, even 
U.S. trade negotiators concede that the automobile issue has no 
basis in economic reality. If Japan were to agree now to 
numerical targets or voluntary goals, it would only leave the 
United States with the impression that it can demand whatever it 
wants and Japan will comply. It would be best for all concerned 
if Japanese automobile companies were to make an unpublicized 
"voluntary" effort to increase purchases of U.S. automotive 
parts. 
<H5>  Reaffirm Market Opening Intentions </H5>
  What then should Japan do? What should be our strategy? 
  First, Japan must impress domestic and foreign observers 
with 
its commitment to market liberalization and free market 
economics by swiftly deregulating the domestic economy. This is 
something Japan should do for its own sake, but it must so all 
the more quickly because of the current impasse in comprehensive 
trade negotiations. 
  The ironclad logic of resisting numerical targets while 
unilaterally deregulating and liberalizing the market would have 
the effect of countering Japan bashers, who claim that Japan is 
somehow different, and supporting the pro-Japanese forces in the 
United States. For example, there have been proposals to amend 
broadcasting standards to allow 20 or more FM stations in the 
regional metropolitan areas to specialize in certain types of 
programming. Others are advocating the complete liberalization 
of airline fares outside of the Haneda corridor. There is no 
need to link these initiative to imports from the United States. 
  In addition, negotiations must become truly "bilateral." The 
current trade negotiations have fallen into the same old pattern 
of the United States making demands and the Japanese responding 
passively. This approach has left both sides frustrated. 
  All exchanges between adults must be reciprocal. There is 
tremendous resentment in Japan against the United States because 
it has broken promises by refusing to reform its patent system 
and lower tariffs on electronic equipment. What is needed is an 
aggressive Japanese campaign to make demands of the United 
States. We need to understand that U.S. public opinion 
concerning international affairs is diverse. 
  Furthermore, Japan must come up with a long-term vision 
concerning the global trading system. What is Japan's 
relationship with the global economy, including and excluding 
the United States? We should play a constructive role in GATT 
and in the establishment of the new World Trade Organization 
(WTO). We should view this as an opportunity to harmonize patent 
systems, define dumping, and determine when subsidies are 
permissible--problems that have exacerbated international trade 
disputes in the past.

"`Illusionary Agreement' Disappeared Prior to Summit Talks"] 
  [Text] "Misreading" by Both U.S. and Japanese 
Ambassadors 
  A scene shown on a television relay screen -- Ambassador to 
Japan W. Mondale, head dropped with hands covering his face, and 
Ambassador to the United States Takakazu Kuriyama among the high 
officials on both sides lined up beside both U.S.-Japanese 
leaders at a joint press conference -- probably symbolically 
indicated the state of the recent U.S.-Japan Summit Talks. 
  At any rate, if President Clinton could say, "It is better 
not to make an agreement with no substance," Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa responded, "There should be no nebulous 
settlement," and the U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiation 
ended without agreement at the U.S.-Japan summit talks on 11 
February. It was the first time in history of postwar 
U.S.-Japanese relations extending over 49 years to see a 
U.S.-Japan summit conference ends in collapse with flat 
opposition. 
  The fact that the economic framework negotiations of two 
preeminent economic superpowers, the United States and Japan, 
ran aground in a complete deadlock means a great risk not only 
for both countries, but also for the world. Why did it end up in 
a state of collapse? What was behind this worst conclusion? 
  What first can be pointed out as a direct cause is the 
"misreading" committed by both the United States and Japan. Both 
sides mutually misread the other's thoughts and attitude more 
than once and that was linked to a conclusion causing them 
greatly to lose sight of the route to agreement. Both 
ambassadors, Mondale, a figure who appeared on television 
holding his head, and Kuriyama, were those among "responsible 
parties." 
  Ambassador to Japan Mondale returned to the United States 
accompanied by J. Foster, councilor of the U.S. Embassy in 
Japan, on 8 February [1994] in advance of Hosokawa's visit to 
the United States, and reported to President Clinton information 
and feelings about the Japan side obtained from Deputy Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Shinseito 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa with whom he had talked on the 
7th, the previous day. He transmitted to the president his 
judgement that "The Japan side probably will give in at the 
end." No doubt this Mondale report greatly influenced the 
negotiation attitude of the U.S. side. 
  On the other hand, when Ambassador to the U.S. Kuriyama 
returned to Japan for a short time and visited Prime Minister 
Hosokawa at his official residence on 1 February, he strongly 
urged that a worsening of U.S.-Japan relations must absolutely 
be avoided and advised that "We should make concessions since 
numerical goals in the government procurement area will be 
acceptable. At this time, however, high officials on the U.S. 
side considered to be the Japan-reconciliation group such as 
presidential aide R. Rubin (in charge of National Economic 
Council or NEC) and Deputy Secretary of the Treasury R. Altman, 
people with the greatest influence in the White House, had been 
leaning toward abandonment of "numerical goals." The advice of 
Ambassador Kuriyama, therefore, exposed his own low level of 
intelligence. 
  The multiplication effect of these misreadings caused both 
sides to make a misjudgment on agreement. However, a more 
substantive cause that drove the economic framework 
negotiations to collapse was the negotiation stance itself of 
both the United States and Japan. While the Clinton 
administration was citing "change" and the Hosokawa regime was 
advocating "reform," the basic perception of both sides about 
their negotiating partner remained unchanged. 
  In other words, the reading of the United States was that if 
it initially hurled big demands and continued to exert strong 
pressure, Japan ultimately would completely surrender as usual; 
and the Japan side, convinced that the U.S. side would keep 
pushing with no room for compromise, thought only of dodging the 
other's attack. 
  What actually happened was that the United States was 
studying concessions with basic demands at a certain stage and 
Japan said "No" at the last moment. 
<H5>  Victorious Mood Only at Kasumigaseki </H5>
  Of course, there was neither victory nor defeat because it 
collapsed without reaching agreement. Notwithstanding, as soon 
as the decision was made to break it off, the tone of the media 
was all a warning of "U.S. retaliation," and voices of 
irritation were raised in the industrial sector such as, "Anyone 
can say `No' and worsen relations. It is diplomacy to improve 
relations" (major precision machinery company president). 
  However, Kasumigaseki was different, and bureaucrats had a 
sort of victorious mood. Especially Koichiro Matsuura, deputy 
minister for foreign affairs (in charge of economics), Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice minister for 
international affairs, Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI), and others who had crossed swords with the U.S. 
side on the very front line of the economic framework 
negotiations related somewhat excitedly just as the summit 
conference ended that "This (having said `No') was a symbol of a 
new U.S.-Japan era." Then words of merry self-praise were also 
heard from among the officers at MOFA, the Ministry of Finance 
(MOF), and MITI, such as "We have said `No' for the first time 
in U.S.-Japan relations since the war," "This is the beginning 
of a mature U.S.-Japan relationship," and "Japan has become on 
par with Europe by this." 
  Viewing the government agency side which had continued to be 
swayed by the U.S. side in previous U.S.-Japan trade relations, 
it probably was a refreshing thought to have said "No" to the 
United States for the first time. That is understood, but can it 
not be said that the merry attitude of such joy at just saying 
"No" is itself proof that U.S.-Japan relations still are 
immature. Also at the same time, one feels that there is a 
dangerous omen in their manner of nationalistic applause at "No" 
to the United States. The danger that a "government official 
led" anti-U.S., hate-U.S. mood will be fomented probably is 
clear. 
  However, it does not seem that Prime Minister Hosokawa 
himself said "No" with the intention of opening "mature, adult 
relationships." In the plane that flew to Washington on 10 
February, the prime minister had rehearsed his English speech 
and took a nap. He hoped for the best and seemed to have thought 
at worst "partial agreement" was possible. 
  How and where had that been misread? Before investigation of 
the circumstances in detail, I would like to summarize here the 
points of the U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiations. 
  The economic framework negotiations started based on "a 
framework for a new economic partnership between the United 
States and Japan" decided at Tokyo talks between [former] Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and President Clinton in July 1993, and 
the Structural Impediments Initiative and individual field talks 
that previously had been conducted were consolidated together 
here. There are 23 structural fields that are the targets of the 
discussions, but three fields of government procurement, 
insurance, and auto and auto parts are considered the priority 
fields. 
  Since September 1993, over 10 U.S.-Japan discussions had 
proceeded by field with vice minister level meetings as the 
axis, but "objective criteria" and "numerical goals" became the 
greatest problem points among them. A U.S.-Japan agreement was 
made on objective criteria as "a method to measure the degree of 
Japanese market openness," but as opposed to the U.S. side which 
considered this "establishment of future goals," the Japan side 
thought it to be "a method measuring the current degree based on 
past performance," and these opposing views became a cause of 
dispute to the end. Regarding numerical goals, U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) M. Kantor says, "We have not used those 
words even once." However, the Japan side criticizes that "The 
numbers which the U.S. side has brought out as objective 
criteria are numerical goals themselves" and has refused to 
accept them. Especially the U.S. demand that "(Japan) also 
guarantee the past growth rate of 20 percent for auto parts in 
the future" has become the biggest point of opposition and 
became one of the major factors that caused the U.S.-Japan 
summit conference to collapse. 
<H5>  "Compromise Proposal" Offered </H5>
  What were the actual moves at the U.S.-Japan economic 
framework negotiations, and what offense and defense unfolded on 
the surface and behind negotiations? 
  With the Hosokawa-Clinton talks on 11 February near at hand, 
the discussions centering on vice minister level talks were at 
the crucial moment. A government source who participated in the 
negotiations says, "At the beginning of February, there were 
prospects for an agreement on most of the insurance field and 
government procurement, and the situation was that about 80 
percent could be settled at the summit talks." 
  But the opposition in the auto and auto parts field became a 
bottleneck and negotiations became deadlocked. On the afternoon 
of 8 February, USTR Kantor gave notice that "he would like to 
suspend negotiations temporarily." A dark mood spread through 
the Japan side negotiation team. 
  However, on the evening of the 9 February [1994], Deputy 
Minister Matsuura of Foreign Affairs was invited to dinner by B. 
Cutter, deputy presidential aid (in charge of international 
economics), who was the responsible person on the U.S. side at 
the administrative level, and offered "a compromise proposal." 
It was verbal. The contents of it were 1) numerical goals would 
not be included, 2) macro fields, government procurement, and 
insurance fields would be lumped together, and 3) auto and auto 
parts would be postponed one to two months. By this, it would be 
acceptable to the Japan side. Wondering "can it be true?," the 
Japan side took heart. 
  Immediately, the Japan side tried to confirm "the Cutter 
proposal," in the negotiations between Matsuura and USTR Deputy 
Representative S. Bashevski (government procurement); Vice 
Minister Okamatsu of International Affairs, MITI, and Under 
Secretary J. Garten of Commerce (auto and auto parts); and Vice 
Minister Kosuke Nakahira of International Affairs, MOF, and 
Under Secretary of the Treasury L. Summers (insurance); but 
there was no such feeling or a sentiment for concessions on the 
U.S. side. It was strange. 
<H5>  Internal Leadership Struggle on U.S. Side </H5>
  Amidst this, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata 
went to Washington a bit earlier than Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
The first Hata-Kantor talks began at 0730 in the morning on the 
10th. At the outset, Kantor faced Hata and appealed, "Let's aim 
at goals." Since Hata had received a report regarding "the 
Cutter proposal" of the previous evening, he responded, "I 
understand what you are saying. That's probably the thing." 
  However, this was a strange Zen dialogue. Hata intended to 
express his resolve that "Because we accept the Cutter proposal, 
let's take it down to the administrative level once on that line 
before bring it to agreement." Kantor, however, took it that 
Hata had shown an attitude of concession and agreed to reopening 
practical level discussions. For both, it was jumping to such a 
hasty conclusion that it is difficult to believe. 
  Such being the situation, the Hata and Kantor talks did not 
proceed at all. Worried, Matsuura contacted Bashevski and asked, 
"What is the matter?" The curt reply was, "The USTR attitude has 
not changed at all." Furthermore, at the vice minister level 
meeting in the afternoon of the same day, the U.S. side 
strengthened its demands for numerical goals. At the second 
Hata-Kantor talk that began at 1600, a heated argument was 
exchanged concerning the meaning of "aim at goals." 
  There was an important move between this first and second 
Hata-Kantor talks. The National Economic Council (NEC) was held 
for a talk with Kantor at the White House, and President 
Clinton, who had received the report of "a sense of concession 
on the Japan side" from Kantor, instructed, "Let's go with the 
original plan. Don't make an agreement without substance." The 
foreshadowing was laid here for the breakdown of discussions. 
  At 1700 on the 10th, with Prime Minister Hosokawa, who had 
arrived in Washington, the Japan side held "an Imperial 
conference" until late at night in Blair House, the 
accommodations for the prime minister. Prime Minister Hosokawa, 
who was informed of the hardline attitude of the U.S. side by 
Hata on this occasion, was considered to have made up his mind 
on "the inevitable collapse." 
  After this, although the final Hata-Kantor talk was 
conducted 
beginning at 0100 on the 11th, it was more or less mutually to 
confirm the other's intransigence and subsequently proceeded all 
at once to the conclusion of the Hosokawa-Clinton talks. 
  The above was the scene of the finale of the U.S.-Japan 
economic framework negotiations, but main point in this process 
was the "illusionary Cutter proposal." That this ended in an 
apparition was clearly because of an inside fight for leadership 
on the U.S. side. In other words, as opposed to the 
reconciliation group of Rubin, Cutter, and others who moved 
toward concessions with Japan, the hardline group centered on 
USTR Kantor rolled back and President Clinton gave the nod to 
the hardline group. 
  However, the Japan side, which could not read the movements 
beneath the surface on the U.S. side, believed in the "Cutter 
proposal" until the next day, misread the other's attitude, and 
added to that, misreadings by the U.S. side which took the 
attitude of the Japan side to be "concession" complicated the 
negotiation. In other words, it was a collapse which 
"misreadings" by both sides invited. 
<H5>  Proposal Carefully Read by Clinton </H5>
  There are two very interesting facts concerning the U.S. 
perception of Japan and attitude determination in the economic 
framework negotiations. 
  One was a letter (dated 20 January) sent to President 
Clinton 
before the summit conference by Glen Fukushima (chief, General 
Policy Division, Japan Branch Office, AT&amp;T and vice 
president of 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Japan), who was thoroughly 
conversant of the ins and outs of U.S.-Japan trade negotiations 
as a former acting deputy USTR representative (in charge of 
Japan). 
  It has been confirmed by the notes of the president himself 
and signatures of high officials that the president carefully 
scanned this Fukushima paper and also had high officials at the 
White House read it. 
  The contents of the Fukushima paper essentially were an 
analysis of the current state of the U.S.-Japan relationship, 
frank criticism of the Clinton Administration's policy on Japan, 
and a proposal concerning concessions to Japan as well as 
strategy on Japan. For example, concerning the attitude to 
which the Clinton Administration should adhere in negotiations 
with Japan, he advised that they must not deal with Japanese 
bureaucrats, "Premised on the power of (Japan's) central 
government bureaucrats, the U.S. Government will unfortunately 
take the wrong road if it pays heed to the advice of Japanese 
bureaucrats whose own existence depend on maintaining the status 
quo." 
  It is interesting to learn the places that attracted the 
attention of the president in the Fukushima's letter by 
President Clinton's notes and underlines. Like thus, for 
example. There is the scribble "agree" at the places where it 
says "The recession will continue longer than expected, but the 
roots of the Japanese economy will not be harmed. They will 
come back again as the strongest enemy" and "On the problem of 
opening Japanese markets, the Clinton administration...does not 
understand when, where, and in what degree to apply it 
(pressure)." Moreover, he underlined it in 15 places such as 
"Even if an agreement is made (with Japan), problems will occur 
several months later due to interpretation of words." 
  A copy of this Fukushima paper was passed to nine high 
officials in the Clinton administration such as USTR 
Representative Kantor and secretary of the treasury Bentsen by 
instruction of the president. 
  Another interesting fact is the "performance" that was 
carried out at the White House directly after the U.S.-Japan 
summit talks. 
  After the joint press conference following the summit talks, 
special Washington correspondents of the Japanese media, one 
from each company, were invited into the Roosevelt Room, which 
is next door to the Oval Room (president's office). Tea and cake 
were served, and there were three hosts to the special 
correspondents: Kantor, presidential adviser D. Gargen, and S. 
Bargar, deputy presidential aide in charge of the National 
Security Council. 
  The reason for this get-together was "because we do not want 
to create a misunderstanding among Asian people because of this 
collapse" (Gargen), but when they got into the briefing, the 
talk of the three on the White House side was in the tone that 
"President Clinton emphasized that he sympathized with Prime 
Minister Hosokawa" (after the summit talks), and when the two 
left the East Room, the president took the arm of Prime Minister 
Hosokawa. This is important." They made many comments that 
emphasized the strength of the ties between Hosokawa and Clinton. 
  A special correspondent who participated [in the 
get-together] commented that "The U.S. side is annoyed by the 
attitude of Japanese bureaucrats in the recent U.S.-Japan 
economic framework negotiations. So, the White House held a 
performance to separate Hosokawa from the bureaucrats." 
<H5>  Hosokawa and Clinton Secret Agreement Theory </H5>
  Of the recent U.S.-Japan economic framework negotiations 
which was complicated by misreadings on both sides, the most 
disappointing issue to the president was the Japanese income tax 
cut. 
  Having continued to press for expansion of Japanese domestic 
demand, the hopes which the U.S. side had pinned upon an 
economic stimulus measure through an income tax cut by the 
Hosokawa cabinet was greater than imagined by Japan, and the 
desire of the U.S. side was "at least 10 trillion yen" as the 
tax cut amount. On this point also, it seems that the U.S. side 
had obtained the feeling through the pipeline of Councilor 
Foster and Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa that "If the 
political reform issue were cleared, Hosokawa would undoubtedly 
carry out a large tax cut." 
  Then, there is the "Hosokawa-Clinton secret agreement 
theory" 
concerning the income tax cut. According to this secret 
agreement theory which has been greatly circulated by stock 
market sources, if the Hosokawa regime implements a domestic 
demand expansion policy of "an income tax cut on the scale of 
about 7 trillion yen and a three-year period of the consumption 
tax deferment," the Clinton administration would consider some 
type of concession regarding numerical goals at the final stage 
of economic framework negotiations. Or, there is also a theory 
that the agreement with Clinton was continued acceptance of 
economic framework negotiations, not numerical goals. 
  The Hosokawa cabinet took up tax system reform when the 
political reform bill was completed, per those expectations of 
the U.S. side. However, the concept of a 6 trillion yen tax cut 
combined with a "national welfare tax" announced at early dawn 
on 3 February encountered opposition within the coalition ruling 
party and the disfavor of public opinion and was scrapped in one 
day. As a result, "a single fiscal year 6 trillion yen" income 
tax and residential tax cut were brought out again on 8 February 
right before the U.S.-Japan summit talks. 
  President Clinton was disappointed by this. Since it would 
have been three years before a raise in the consumption tax rate 
if it had been the scrapped tax cut bill, the tax cut amount for 
a three years' portion at 6 trillion yen would total 18 trillion 
yen. However, it will end at 6 trillion yen with a single fiscal 
year limit. The U.S. side decide that it would not serve to 
expand domestic demand. 
  Secretary of the Treasury Bentsen, therefore, came to sound 
out the MOF about "whether the 6 trillion tax cut could continue 
in the second year and thereafter," but Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii only repeated the vague response that "future 
issues await a consensus among the ruling party." Even at vice 
minister class discussions, Vice Minister Nakahira of 
International Affairs could not respond at all to the inquiries 
by Under Secretary Summers of the Treasury. 
  The president, who had been betrayed in expectations that 
"Hosokawa would make a large tax cut," explored "the possibility 
of a prime minister's political decision concerning a tax cut 
for a second year and thereafter" at the summit talks, but Prime 
Minister Hosokawa only said, "because of the Japanese budget 
compilation system and political situation, under present 
conditions, I can only agree to a tax cut measure for a single 
year. One high official at the White House relates that 
"Hosokawa gave the president the impression that he was dancing 
to the choreography of MOF bureaucrats." 
  The "secret agreement" on "some type of concessions in 
numerical goals" was called off by this. 
  Ultimately, even though refusing "an agreement without 
substance," President Clinton undoubtedly had tied expectations 
to the attitude of the Japan side until the last moment. At the 
stage directly before the summit talks, he awaited "a souvenir" 
from the Japan side because it had been the old trick of the 
Japan side in previous U.S.-Japan negotiations that while being 
noncommittal up until the final phase of negotiations, the big 
shots of Japan would fly into Washington at the last moment 
carrying some "souvenir" or a nice "hidden jewel." 
<H5>  "Doesn't Want To See His Face" </H5>
  The U.S. side seem to have thought that the Japan side would 
make similar moves again. They thought that "the U.S. visit by 
Kiuchi" on 8 February "probably would be that." Akitane Kiuchi, 
former ambassador to France, "set out to explore the feelings of 
the U.S. side" as a special envoy of the prime minister (MOFA 
source), but the U.S. side viewed it as perhaps coming with "a 
souvenir" because he was specially flying in before the summit 
talks. Actually, however, Special Envoy Kiuchi was completely 
empty-handed. 
  Next, the U.S. side expectations were for the "the U.S. 
visit 
by Hata." Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hata was 
initially scheduled to go with Prime Minister Hosokawa, but he 
entered Washington a day earlier than the prime minister on 9 
February. On the day before his departure, Hata had invited 
Ambassador Mondale to the MOFA Iikura Kokan Building to talk. 
There even was the observation circulating among U.S.-Japan 
negotiations sources in Washington who welcomed Hata that "the 
`souvenir' would be either a policy of enlarging the income tax 
cut or concessions in the field of auto and auto parts." 
However, Hata was also completely empty-handed and he did not 
bring so much as a "hidden jewel." 
  The ones who bring the "souvenir" or "hidden jewel" are 
generally influential men because of the very fact that they are 
big shots, and the ones who prepare them are bureaucrats. 
Therefore, if they do not know how to handle the bureaucrats, 
they have no choice but to go empty-handed. So, doubts increased 
on the U.S. side about the leadership ability of Prime Minister 
Hosokawa. 
  Such being the circumstance, the Japanese side being at the 
beck and call of the bureaucrats was markedly noticeable in the 
recent economic framwork negotiations. With their state of 
self-complacency that "we have squelched them because they have 
brought out unreasonable numbers" even at the division chief 
class on the administrative level, the repulsion of the U.S. 
side at the excessive "bureaucratic leadership" style had 
escalated. Amidst this, the communications gap between the MOF 
and the Treasury Department on macro policy matters was 
terrible, and Under Secretary Summers of the Treasury, who was 
the responsible person for U.S. side negotiations in the 
insurance field, had spoken out that "I don't want to see the 
face" of Vice Minister Nakahira of Foreign Affairs, the person 
responsible on the Japan side. 
<H5>  High Yen Inducement Strategy in Future </H5>
  The fact that "a Japan that can say no" showed itself to the 
world in the recent U.S.-Japan summit talks can probably be 
called a harvest in its own way. At the same time, however, it 
also has angered the United States to the extent that voices 
have been raised, "Why did Hosokawa especially come as far as 
Washington if it was just to say `No'" (U.S. government 
authority)? 
  Just by the fact that the United States got into a rage, the 
exchange market swung to a high yen directly after the collapse 
of the U.S.-Japan summit talks and leapt to $1 equals 101 yen. 
It seems that lately the yen market somewhat has recovered its 
composure, but full-scale invokement of U.S. "high yen 
inducement strategy" will be in the future and the possibility 
must be viewed of a yen rise to the "$1 equals 105 yen to 95 
yen" level advocated by F. Bargsten, the director of the 
Institute of International Economics (IIE), who is an 
influential adviser on economic policy in the Clinton 
administration. 
  Japan's export industry is calculated to become a minus of 1 
trillion yen overall if it becomes 5 yen higher to the dollar. 
However, this is strictly a macro number and viewed on the 
corporate level including subcontracts and sub-subcontracts, 
that damage probably will be close to a fatal blow. 
  In addition to that, as a retaliatory measure for the "No" 
of 
Japan, the United States has worked out various sanctions 
against Japan. The demand to open the market for mobile 
telephones was the first shot, but sanctions against Japan 
centering on electrical communications instruments and the 
auto-related undoubtedly will accelerate and expand in the 
future. 
  There also has been a move to restore the Super 301 Clause 
(designation and sanction of unfair trade nations) of the 
General Trade Law. From the outset, President Clinton is a man 
who has advocated the revival and strengthening of the Super 301 
Clause since during the presidential election and together with 
pressure from Congress and government circles, the restoration 
of the Super 301 Clause by presidential order is a very great 
possibility. 
  It will take time procedurally until such sanction measures 
move to implementation, but it seems that the aim of the U.S. 
side is to produce a "combined effect" with the high yen 
strategy which has an immediate effect. There is also the 
ominous view that "If the two-stage strategy of high yen and 
sanctions is invoked, a Clinton Shock to rival the previous 
Nixon Shock will attack Japan" (international finance source). 
In any case, the compensation for having asserted "No" in 
Washington will probably be a lot more pain than the politicians 
and bureaucrats anticipated. 
<H5>  Cost of "No" Really Is Expensive </H5>
  Prime Minister Hosokawa, who found that the retaliatory 
reaction of the U.S. side was unexpectedly strong, is trying 
hard to put together a new open market policy along with 
tendering his submission that "the U.S. Government take sensible 
decisions and actions," but so long as he does not propose 
anything more than the recent demands by the U.S. side, the U.S. 
side would not consent. A move is now proceeding within the U.S. 
Government that will cause Prime Minister Hosokawa anxiety. That 
is the move toward regression by the Japan-reconciliation group 
and an enlargement of the voice of the hardline group. Before 
the U.S.-Japan opposition concerning the economic framework 
negotiations deepened, Presidential Aide Rubin (former chairman 
of Goldman Saxs), Deputy Secretary Altman (former vice chairman 
of the Blackstone Group) of the Treasury, and others who have 
been called "the Wall Street mafia" in the U.S. Government and 
the White House because of coming from the financial sector, had 
a voice as the Japan-reconciliation group. However, Altman was 
angry that the Hosokawa regime broke its pledge with the United 
States with the income tax cut and has left the 
Japan-reconciliation group. Rising in position there is the 
Japan-hardline group such as USTR Kantor and USTR Deputy 
Representative Bashevski, considered the "attorney mafia" having 
been attorneys, who scored in the U.S.-Japan economic framework 
negotiations. 
  The trend of this "Wall Street mafia" versus "attorney 
mafia" 
greatly influenced the conclusion of the economic framework 
negotiations. In the future, the hardline group probably will 
also have an increased voice in the aspect of sanctions against 
Japan. 
  Japan has been treated lightly, such as saying that in 
Japan, 
"They can say No...." However, as we have just found out, the 
cost of "No" is really expensive. In the advanced diplomatic 
nation of Great Britain, when they want to say "No," they say, 
"Yes, but..." or in other words, that is right, but....
