  [Excerpt] Thai law enforcers should start looking into the 
allegations of drug trafficking made against Chat Thai MP 
Thanong Siriprichapong, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said 
yesterday. 
  Information provided by US authorities linking Thanong to a 
conspiracy to smuggle 45 tones of marijuana into the United 
States from 1973-87 constituted grounds for an investigation, he 
said. 
  "With or without US urging, it is the duty of Thai law 
eforcement officials to take action. Police have a duty to 
investigate alleged wrongdoers -- no matter who they are," the 
prime minister said. "In the case in question, there are 
adequate grounds for investigation." 
  House Speaker Marut Bunnak yesterday said a Chat Thai 
urgency 
motion asking the House of Representatives to consider taking 
action against Thanong had been put on the agenda. 
  The motion was item 14 on the agenda, but could be brought 
forward if MPs wished. 
  Submitted by Chamnong Phothisaro (Chat Thai-Sisaket), it 
asks 
the House of Representatives to decide what to do about the 
Nakhon Phanom MP, charging that the allegations against him have 
affected the credibility of the House. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 14 -- Former heavyweight world boxing 
champion Muhammad Ali is now in Vietnam as goodwill envoy 
accompanied by five other Americans in a mission of researching 
Americans missing in action (MIA) during the Vietnam war. 
  Ali, 52 and suffering from Parkinson's Disease which impairs 
his motor control, refused to carry out military service during 
the Vietnam war and was therefore stripped of the crown he had 
won in 1964, however, he successfully fought the US Government 
in court and regained the title in 1974. 
  In Hanoi, Ali met with Vietnamese sport officials and 
representatives of the State Committee for Cooperation and 
Investment and the Finance Ministry. He was also received by 
cabinet minister in charge of a number of government affairs Ha 
Quang Du. 
  Ali said that he came to Vietnam with a view to improve the 
mutual understanding between the peoples of Vietnam and America. 
Yesterday Ali went south for a tour of Hue, Da Nang and Ho Chi 
Minh City.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 14 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- It is 
evident that the United Nations obstructed any action to be 
taken against the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that Malaysia 
has expressed dissatisfaction with the situation, Prime Minister 
Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said here Friday. 
  It seems like there is an attempt to force the Muslims in 
Bosnia to accept whatever decision the UN adopts, he said. 
  When we question NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), 
it refers us to the UN ... When we ask the UN, it says NATO has 
to make the decision. 
  Dr. Mahathir spoke to reporters at the airport on his return 
from an overseas trip which had taken him to Zimbabwe, South 
Africa, France, the United States, and China. 
  He made the comments after extending condolences to the 
family of Major Ariffin Zakaria, the Malaysian soldier who was 
killed in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Thursday. The 33-year-old 
soldier was killed when United Nations peacekeepers came under 
fire from the Serbs near Sarajevo. 
  The decisions of the UN favour the assumption that the Serbs 
have control over Bosnian territory and this is what saddens me, 
he said. 
  On statements by several countries in support of Malaysia's 
call for the resignation of UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali, Dr. Mahathir said the UN representative in Bosnia, 
Yashushi Akashi, should also be removed. 
  He said he felt that Akashi seemed to be obstructing any 
action to be taken against the Serbs. 
  Dr. Mahathir also said that Western countries were now 
beginning to criticize Butrus-Ghali and Akashi. 
  Maj. Ariffin was the second Malaysian soldier killed in the 
conflict. Last month, Maj. Ramli Shaari was killed after he 
stepped on a mine in Croatia.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The United States Should Obey the Demand of the </F>
International Community"] 
  [Text] While studying at George Washington University, 
Bill Clinton asked a senator for a job. He was told that there 
was no permanent job in that office. There were only two 
part-time jobs available there. Clinton offered to hold the two 
posts. This might symbolize Clinton as a hard worker or a 
monopolizer. This event happened about 30 years ago. He is now 
occupying the White House as head of a world superpower. The 
world is now demanding that Clinton work hard. We simply want 
him to take up the greatest and most challenging job, that is to 
use his power to end the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Clinton once wrote: "A leader will only be useful if he or 
she is strongly determined to confront any issue. We cannot 
accept a policy marginally or are reluctant to act as this will 
cause politics to lose its essence." 
  During a meeting with Clinton yesterday, Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir gave a viewpoint that contradicted the U.S. action 
regarding the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Will Clinton be 
able to fulfil the demand? We are confident that Clinton, being 
the first U.S. President elected in the post-Cold War era, will 
be able to fulfil the wish of the international community 
without much ado. We abide by the principles that Clinton 
belonged to a generation that grew up during the Cold War era 
and that realized how a superpower rivalry could bring the world 
to destruction. He was already aware that wars had brought 
about the worst effects the world can experience. Why, however, 
has he acted so weakly? Clinton should know that the current 
generation should not be forced to tie itself to the mood 
[preceding word in English] and events formed in the superpower 
political arena. The entire world is being haunted by fears of 
worsening wars. 
  The international community wants a world that is reliable 
and capable of ensuring the welfare of mankind. They want 
strong, noble world leaders capable of telling the truth. We 
want to see Clinton, being leader of a superpower, to give the 
the world a greater sense of security. Is he capable of leading 
the world or is the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina too great to 
resolve? Does he remain a "monopolizer?" 
  As Clinton was once a strong supporter of Jimmy Carter's 
human rights policy vis-a-vis the refugee issue, this is time 
for him to prove his commitment by settling a greater issue -- 
brutal persecution, rapes, and murders. We want Clinton to 
fulfill the demand of the international community. We want the 
United States to rethink and work for the welfare of the rest of 
the world. 
  The United States should use this opportunity to restore its 
image before the international community. The United States 
should change its policy of seeing a problem on the basis of 
potential profit to one based on humanity. The policy that arms 
sales are more important than human lives means that the United 
States has no respect for the international community. It would 
be useless for Clinton to say that education should be available 
for all human beings, if Bosnian children were unable to study 
because school buildings had been destroyed and it was dangerous 
to go to school. 
  The United States should not deceive the world by distorting 
facts about the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If this continues, a 
proverb that "a nation creates a war to gain wealth, while an 
anti-war nation in fact creates a war" is correct. The slogan 
"Make Profits Out of War" is nothing new in the superpower 
context. As explained by Dr. Mahathir, the United States should 
use its power and influence to end the brutalities in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Economists and political theorists are not 
truthful. They work in certain circumstances, but not in others. 
This is why Western-style democracy and free market enterprises 
do not harmoniously guarantee a national success. It differs 
from country to country. China is one of them. As Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed pointed out in Beijing, 
the country has its own political and economic agenda. So far, 
it has worked for the country which is grappling with a 
population in excess of 1.2 billion people. Therefore, to bring 
prosperity to all its people is a tall order. Absolute 
democracy based on Western standards is not practical in China. 
Neither is a completely free market economy. Russia is a prime 
example of how capitalism after the scrapping of a centrally 
planned economy has failed. China does not want to suffer a 
similar fate. Its economy is a dome of a free enterprise 
coupled with socialist elements. In this way, it guarantees the 
distribution of wealth to the people. At the same time, the 
country realizes it needs foreign markets. So, it opens its own 
market to foreign enterprises while making inroads into to 
others. 
  This is what Southeast Asian countries have a lot to gain. 
China offers a huge market potential. Rather than harboring 
fears about its alleged military aggression, it is time to look 
to China as a valuable business partner. But China has to 
reassure others that it is not bent on a military conquest. A 
recent report that the country was building up its military 
facilities is indeed disturbing. This is compounded by 
overlapping claims on certain territories. Without doubt, flash 
points do exist. But in the overall scheme of things, China, 
too, has to trade with Southeast Asian countries. It is the 
interdependent relationship that China would not want to 
jeopardize through unwarranted military exploits. If that is all 
China is keen to assert, then such a picture has been painted by 
the Western powers. After all, Western powers believe 
self-preservation can only be achieved through military 
expansion. This is not the case in this part of the world. For 
business to succeed, a country needs order. Otherwise, it will 
lead to a weak government and discourage foreign investment. 
That is what China has set out to do for there is a massive 
potential for all through greater economic interaction. Even 
without China's potential not fully exploited [as heard], the 
Asia-Pacific region has emerged as the fastest growth area in 
the world. What more if the huge potential in China is 
harnessed? This is unimaginable given China's potentially vast 
market. Most importantly, it can be the engine of growth for 
this region first and perhaps the rest of the world. 
  Malaysia recognizes China's huge economic potential and the 
vital role it can play. It has already embarked on enhancing 
two-way trade and investment with China. Numerous Malaysian 
companies are penetrating the huge Chinese market. In return, 
many Chinese companies are looking into trade and investment in 
Malaysia. Malaysia's move is, therefore, a step in the right 
direction in its approach toward China. Malaysia welcomes a 
wealthy and prosperous China, knowing very well its [word 
indistinct] benefit would be far-reaching.

<F P=106> [By Noorzita Samad] </F>
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- Bank Negara [Central Bank] 
Governor Ahmad Mohamed Don today announced the relaxation of a 
monetary measure which was instituted to control the inflow of 
speculative funds from abroad. 
  Effective May 16, foreigners will no longer be required to 
pay a levy to commercial banks for holding their ringgit funds 
-- a term referred to as "negative interest" in the banking 
circle. 
  These funds held in vostro accounts (non-interest bearing 
ringgit funds held by foreigners in local banks) will no longer 
be subjected to statutory reserve and liquidity requirements. 
  To moderate the effect of the lifting of this negative 
interest measure, Bank Negara will mop up additional liquidity 
by raising the statutory reserve ratio (SRR) from 9.5 per cent 
to 10.5 per cent effective Monday. 
  The SRR is the amount of funds based on a percentage of 
eligible liabilities or reserve assets that commercial and 
merchant banks and finance companies need to place with the 
Central Bank. 
  These two measures will likely result in a return of foreign 
funds into the local financial system and help shore up the 
strength of the ringgit. 
  Ahmad said in a statement that these measures were 
consistent 
with the Central Bank's overall strategy of creating a conducive 
environment for genuine investors as well as maintaining price 
stability. 
  "Bank Negara will continue to monitor the situation and will 
not hesitate to introduce measures as and when necessary to 
achieve its objectives." 
  In line with this, commercial banks, nevertheless, are still 
required to place their vostro balances with Bank Negara for it 
"to continue sterilising the remaining inflows". 
  The negative interest rate measure introduced in February 
had 
been successful in reducing the amount of speculative funds 
maintained in vostro accounts from a high of more than RM 
[Ringgit Malaysia] 8 billion in January to RM2.6 billion 
yesterday. 
  "Consequently, it is no longer necessary to continue with a 
negative interest rate on the vostro balances held by foreign 
banking institutions." 
  The newly appointed Bank Negara Governor also outlined the 
importance he would place on fighting inflation, giving an 
indication of how he would tackle the problem. 
  He said much of today's inflation was anticipatory, hence 
psychological in nature. 
  "The objective of the policy is to affect inflationary 
expectations so that they will not become self-fulfilling. 
  "In this, Bank Negara stands prepared to do whatever it 
takes 
to ensure that the inflationary psychology is not entrenched. 
  "We will act again, when act we must, in order to convince 
investors, businesses and the public that the (Central) bank 
will continue to give priority to this continuing battle against 
inflation." 
  Ahmad said large inflows of speculative funds had prompted 
the Central Bank to take drastic steps of late to re-establish 
control over the monetary aggregates. 
  "Now that most of the speculators have unwound their 
positions, the ringgit has strengthened in the markets. 
  "Before long, the positive impact of the bank's various 
measures, including those announced today, will be reflected in 
the financial markets in a way that should bring new confidence 
in the bank's resolve to fight inflation." 
  The ringgit reacted positively today, closing higher at 
2.6100/30 against the US dollar from 2.6180/90 yesterday. 
  Dealers attributed the active trading to buying interest in 
the ringgit, fuelled by talks that Bank Negara is raising the 
SRR and lifting the restriction on the vostro accounts.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Won't America Let It Be?"] </F>
  [Text] One week after Michael Fay received his caning 
punishment and despite the helpful words of US Vice-President 
Albert Gore about moving on from there, there is still too much 
rancour in the Americans' management of the fallout, thus causng 
one to ponder two questions. Are relations between the two 
countries, with strategic and economic interests that override 
everything else, worth dicing with for the sake of emotional 
bombast over a court judgment? If the answer is no, why does 
the US persist with petty acts that would call into question its 
commitment not only to diplomatic relations with friendly 
countries, but also the primacy of the written law? If the US 
is the only superpower left, it needs to behave like one. It 
would not want to look silly over a matter as routine as Fay's 
punishment. The Singapore Government had been proper, in the 
face of abuse and rabid talk from both the US media and the Fay 
family, in asking that both sides "focus on their larger mutual 
interests and put this incident behind them." And this from the 
party sinned against: Fay had been dealt with by the book. 
Singapore had nothing to be sorry for what had happened. It was 
a straightforward court matter. We ask if the US is serious 
about wanting to move on from here when, in the space of two 
days, a high official in the administration goes on what looks 
like a personal vendetta against Singapore, and the State 
Department continues to equivocate about the truth of Fay's 
injuries from caning. 
  Mr Mickey Kantor, the Trade Representative, was guilty of 
gross indecency when he said that Singapore should be denied the 
privilege of hosting the World Trade Organisation's [WTO's] 
inaugural conference next year. The Fay link was transparent. 
Mr Kantor was hijacking the decision-making prerogative of the 
WTO's global membership, an indiscretion that should be 
condemned. Member states decide who shall be the host. 
Singapore may not get the vote, but it should not be because of 
the Fay case. If the WTO can be dragged into a bilateral 
squabble, just as the Olympic movement was debased over the 
argument about China's human rights record, a new and dangerous 
distortion would become the norm in the conduct of international 
relations. America would not want to claim the patent rights to 
that, surely. Mr Kantor's remark was irresponsible, never mind 
the crassness for which he is sometimes known. After the State 
Department had said he was expressing a personal view as the 
government had no opinion on who shall be host has America ever 
cared about such things?, Mr Kantor was unrepentant. Singapore, 
no -- he repeated. Question: If a loose cannon is allowed to 
contradict policy, how much damage could be done? President 
Bill Clinton, a personal friend of Mr Kantor's, needs to be 
fastidious about cabinet house-keeping. 
  As for the dispute over how badly Fay had been hurt in the 
caning, the pertinent issue is truthfulness as it affects 
relations. The extent of Fay's injuries is irrelevant. Caning 
will invariably leave marks and it would sometimes draw blood. 
The Prisons Department should not have had to explain how mild 
the injuries had been and how well Fay had taken the caning. To 
the government's objections that the description of boy's 
condition -- as given by his father and lawyer in America based 
on an account given a US Embassy official here -- was 
exaggerated, the State Department has been waffling. If it does 
not believe the Prisons Department's account, it should say 
outright that the Singapore Government is lying. The government 
will no doubt respond appropriately. We have no cause to doubt 
the accuracy of the official account. If the U.S. accepts it as 
accurate, it owes Singapore an obligation to be forthright. In 
the process, end the spectacle of the government of the world's 
strongest nation being manipulated by an overwrought family. It 
was amusing, now it gets tiresome.

<F P=106> [By Mathew Pereira] </F>
  [Text] Instructors from the Singapore Armed Forces [SAF] 
showed soldiers from the Philippine Army (PA) the finer points 
of Fighting in Built-Up Areas (Fibua) yesterday. 
  The visiting army later executed a near-perfect mock attack 
to secure three buildings at the Safti [Singapore Armed Forces 
Training Institute] training area under the watchful eyes of 
Singapore trainers. 
  The PA soldiers were part of a 200-strong contingent which 
is 
in Singapore for Exercise Anoa-Singa 2/94. 
  The exercise allows for cross-training between the troops of 
the two countries. 
  This is the first bilateral army exercise between the two 
countries to be held Singapore and the second the Anoa-Singa 
series. The previous exercise was held in the Philippines last 
year. 
  Anoa-Singa 2/94 is conducted under a memorandum of 
understanding the the countries signed last week. 
  It provides for regular joint exercises between the two 
armed 
forces. The two countries take turns to host it. 
  Among those observing yesterday's attack were the chief of 
Defence Force, Major-General Ng Jui Ping, and the chief of 
staff, Arme Forces of the Philippines, Lt-General Arturo T. 
Enrile. 
  The Fibua practice was also one of the activities which 
kicked off Anoa-Singa 2/94. 
  While the men tackled urban warfare, their commanders were 
put through a fully computerised wargaming system. The 
seven-day bilateral exercise is being held in the Safti training 
area. 
  Maj-Gen Ng and Lt-Gen Enrile opened the exercise at a short 
ceremony at the SAF Wargame Centre in Jurong earlier in the 
morning. 
  Maj-Gen Ng, in his speech, said the SAF had always valued 
joint exercises with friendly forces. 
  He said: "Not only do such exercises provide good avenues 
for 
us to learn from one another, they forge close understanding 
between the leaders, officers, and men of both armed forces. 
Over time, as the officers advance in the careers, they bring 
to defence relations that special insight into the other armed 
forces and that special rapport with its leaders." 
  Lt-Gen Enrile said the bilateral initiative underpinned the 
desire of the two sides to expand their interaction. 
  About 600 officers and men from the 1st and 2nd Battalions, 
Singapore Guards are involved in the exercise. 
  Their Filipino counter are from the PA's 56th Infantry 
Battalion (56IB). The troops arrived here last Friday and will 
leave on May 21. 
  The Defence Ministry said Exercise Anoa-Singa reflects the 
warm and friendly ties between the two countries' armed forces.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The U.S. defense 
secretary, Perry, said recently that the United States was 
examining steps to shorten the time needed for the preparation 
of the dispatch of U.S. aircraft carriers to the Korean 
peninsula and increase the stockpile of ammunition of the U.S. 
Forces stationed in South Korea and Japan, reported THE 
WASHINGTON POST May 12. 
  Perry and other U.S. brasshats cried that "a war must be 
imagined", threatening "sanctions" against the DPRK, the paper 
said. 
  On the 14th of May, Woolsey, director of the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency, at a meeting held in Boston openly argued 
that the U.S. intelligence agents should be "infiltrated" into 
the DPRK "in the disguise of forwarding agents or seamen" over 
the "nuclear issue". 
  U.S. President Clinton in his recent interview with the U.S. 
CNN TV, taking issue with the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the 
DPRK, declared that "a decisive stand" would be taken in the 
U.S.- led international moves for a solution to it. 
  These facts prove that the United States is bringing the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, 
invariably pursuing the policy of stifling the DPRK.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Aggressor Forces Aimed at Asian </F>
Countries"] 
  [Text] While the United States is intensifying its 
strong-arm politics against our Republic under the pretext of 
the nuclear issue, the U.S. Forces in Japan are making dangerous 
moves. The U.S. Forces' military exercises are frequently 
conducted in various places in Japan, and the aircraft carriers 
and nuclear submarines are frequently calling at Japanese ports. 
This shows that the U.S. bellicose circles continue to pursue 
their Korean and Asian policy from a force-oriented position 
[himui ipchangeso]. 
  It is the invariable U.S. policy to maintain and intensify 
the domination over the Asia-Pacific region. This U.S. policy 
is becoming more conspicuous today when the power balance is 
broken in the international arena. The United States is 
particularly nervous about the Western powers taking increasing 
interest in this region in recent years with the economic 
development of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region and with 
the strategic importance and significance of this region brought 
to the fore. This is leading the United States to head in the 
direction of further strengthening its influence and power 
sphere over the Asia-Pacific region. Here the U.S. ruling 
circles give great significance to the force-oriented policy 
[himui chongchaek]. A typical example of this is the present 
U.S. scheme to continuously maintain and strengthen the U.S. 
Forces and their bases in Japan under the pretext of our nuclear 
issue. 
  The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are claiming that the 
maintenance and strengthening of the U.S. Forces in Japan is 
aimed at strengthening the Japan-U.S. security. But this is a 
lie, and a deception and mockery at the peace-loving people of 
Asia and the world. 
  It is not hard to know this from the composition and the 
particulars of the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan. The U.S. Armed 
Forces in Japan are the mobile strike forces of an offensive 
type composed of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. They have all 
the arms and equipment--from tactical to strategic 
weapons--enabling them to carry out operations in any region of 
Asia, and their function is to carry out the role of a shock 
brigade for the aggressive U.S. Asian strategy. 
  The U.S. Forces and their bases in Japan participate, 
without 
exception, in the war exercises conducted in the Asia-Pacific 
region, and are used as supply and launching bases for war 
exercises. Here they are strengthening the operational and 
commanding system among the U.S., Japanese, and South Korean 
forces and accelerating the preparations for overseas 
aggression. This shows that the U.S. Forces in Japan are not 
for the Japan-U.S. security but they are aggressor forces aimed 
at the Asia-Pacific region using Japan and South Korea as a 
stepping stone. 
  The U.S. Armed Forces in Japan are the nuclear forces aimed 
at maintaining nuclear superiority in the Asia-Pacific region 
and attacking other countries. Not to be overlooked is the fact 
that the operational focus of the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan is 
directed at our country. The U.S. imperialists, who overturned 
[twijibo opun] the DPRK-U.S. talks, are busily moving the U.S. 
Armed Forces in Japan, babbling about coping with our nuclear 
development. The U.S. Armed Forces in Japan aimed at our 
country are prepared to be put into war at any time. 
  The U.S. ruling circles are advertising, brazen-facedly, 
that 
the U.S. Forces in Japan are a so-called war-deterrent. This is 
nothing but a sophistry. The U.S. Forces and their bases in 
Japan are the source of misfortune that threatens the 
sovereignty, independence, peace, and security of our country 
and other countries in Asia. 
  The United States should immediately withdraw its Armed 
Forces in conformity with today's environment in which the Cold 
War ended, and clearly know that the force-oriented policy is 
far from an omnipotent prescription.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 13 May commentary: "Dangerous Game of Fire </F>
Aimed at Launching Attacks for Northward Invasion"] 
  [Text] Under the code name of joint tactical exercise for 
the first half of this year, the South Korean puppets started a 
joint military exercise of the puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force 
on 9 May. This game of fire, which reportedly will continue 
until 14 May, is being played more frantically as time goes by. 
  This war exercise includes an exercise for combat 
preparations, an exercise for chemical, biological, and 
radiological warfare, an exercise for transportation of troops 
and equipment, and an emergency take-off and landing exercise, 
all of which are aimed at launching attacks against us. This 
exercise is being conducted more frantically in the northern 
part of Kyonggi Province, close to the Military Demarcation Line. 
  On 9 May the puppets mobilized a large-scale (?flotilla) 
composed of various warships and conducted provocative war 
exercises, such as a maritime mobile exercise, while babbling 
about a need to get ready to take a countermeasure at the 
initial stage of war. The warmongers also conducted a joint 
airborne jump exercise and a joint field exercise with the U.S. 
Forces on the East Sea of Korea [as heard]. 
  All these facts show that the war exercise which the United 
States and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique started this time 
is a dangerous game of fire aimed at attacking us in 
three-dimensional operations in the air and on land and sea. 
  As usual, the puppets propagandized that they started this 
war exercise to get ready for someone else's surprise attacks 
and infiltrations. This is a mere sophism aimed at concealing 
their bellicose colors as those who deliberately aggravate the 
situation on the Korean peninsula and rush to confrontation and 
war. 
  As is well known, we hope that the problem of peace in the 
country and its peaceful reunification will be solved through 
dialogue and negotiations and are constantly making efforts 
toward that end. To hasten the country's reunification, we made 
public the 10-point program of the great unity of the entire 
nation and, recently, advanced a proposal for convening a 
national meeting. Moreover, under a tense situation in which the 
danger of new war is ever growing on the Korean peninsula, we 
advanced a momentous proposal on turning the Armistice into a 
stable peace and is making efforts to implement this proposal. 
It is clear even to a very small child that our efforts for 
peace and reunification are not intended for surprise attacks or 
infiltrations. It is the U.S. imperialists and South Korean 
warmongers who pursue surprise attacks and infiltrations on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  As disclosed, the South Korean puppets have already mapped 
out new Operation Plan 5027, a plan to provoke a war of 
northward invasion with the United States. The United States is 
concentrating massive aggression forces on South Korea and its 
vicinity to inflict a nuclear catastrophe on our nation. It 
also has deployed Patriot missiles and attack helicopters in 
South Korea. The U.S. warmongers unhesitatingly make 
powder-reeking remarks that they would not hesitate to wage a 
war or refrain from launching preemptive strikes. U.S. Defense 
Secretary Perry, a ringleader of war [chonjaeng tumok], sneaked 
into South Korea and had a war confab. 
  In the tactical exercise, the puppets moved massive troops 
and equipment close to the Military Demarcation Line and played 
a game of fire in the air and on land and sea. Needless to say, 
in so doing, they aim to complete their readiness to launch 
attacks for northward aggression according to the U.S. 
imperialists' policy of war. 
  The United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must 
know that their dangerous game of fire, which leads the 
situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war, will 
never bring good results to them. The South Korean people will 
never forgive the warmongers who pursue fratricidal conflicts 
[tongjok sangjan].

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- American professor of 
Chicago University Bruce Cumings said at an academic seminar on 
the theme of "nuclear war crisis in Asia" that the United States 
should strive to pull nuclear weapons out of South Korea with 
the responsibility for its introduction according to NEW KOREA 
TIMES, a paper of overseas Koreans. 
  It is, he said, for a political purpose to keep up the cold 
war in the Korean peninsula that the United States is putting 
pressure on North Korea while keeping itself from making an 
official utterance on the introduction of nuclear weapons in 
South Korea. 
  Criticising the one-sided press attitude of the American 
media gossiping about "nuclear suspicion" in North Korea, the 
professor said that for the elimination of nuclear arms in the 
Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification, it is 
preferential to have a correct understanding of the starting of 
the June 25 war, the U.S.-South Korean military tieup, the South 
Korean authorities' attitude towards the North, etc. 
  It is proper for the United States to solve the "nuclear 
issue" by means of dialogue with North Korea, not by military 
means, he stressed.

of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, on May 
16 met and had a conversation with a delegation of the American 
Committee on Korea led by its executive director John M. Swomley. 
  The head of the delegation said he was deeply moved by 
achievements made in Korea in political, economic, cultural and 
other domains. 
  Pointing to distorted propaganda continued in the United 
States on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, he said he 
could witness with his own eyes the Korean People's Army 
participating in the construction with shovels and helping 
farmers in their work in countryside, not preparing a war. 
  He said he saw peaceful and happy Korean people's looks 
through Korean visit.

  [Text] On the occasion of the 14th anniversary of the 18 
May Kwangju resistance struggle, about 50,000 people, including 
members of opposition circles and college students, held rallies 
and demonstration struggle throughout South Korea. 
  According to broadcasts from Seoul, today, on the eve of the 
14th anniversary of the 18 May Kwangju resistance struggle, 
about 50,000 people, including members of opposition 
organizations and college students throughout South Korea, held 
rallies and staged demonstrations demanding to know the truth 
about the Kwangju resistance struggle and the punishment of 
responsible figures. 
  The National Alliance for Democracy and National 
Reunification held a national meeting with participation of 
2,000 of its members and students in Chongmyo Park in Seoul at 
1600 today. 
  The participants in the meeting strongly demanded that the 
truth about the Kwangju incident, which is still concealed 
behind the curtain, be revealed and those responsible for 
oppression be punished. 
  The students of 13 universities in Seoul, including Yonsei 
University and Chungang University, rose in the struggle. About 
700 students from the Korea Federation of University Student 
Councils held a rally in Yonsei University, and dashed toward 
Yonhui-tong, where the houses of traitors No Tae-u and Chon 
Tu-hwan are located, and staged demonstrations. 
  About 600 college students from the Seoul Area Federation of 
University Student Councils gathered at Yonsei University and 
demanded to know the truth about the Kwangju democratization 
movement and the punishment of those responsible for repression. 
They then staged street demonstrations advancing toward the 
homes of traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the ringleaders of 
the Kwangju massacre. 
  On the other hand, the puppet authorities deployed about 
12,000 police forces around their homes and placed them under 
the posture for repression. 
  The number of students who rose in the struggle throughout 
South Korea, including Seoul, reached more than 10,000 from 44 
universities. They held events marking the Kwangju resistance 
struggle in their universities respectively. 
  Meanwhile, on the eve of the 14th anniversary of the 18 May 
Kwangju democratization resistance struggle, events paying 
tribute to Kwangju martyrs were held in Kwangju. About 10,000 
Kwangju citizens and students gathered at the plaza in front of 
the building in South Cholla Province, and recalled days of the 
resistance struggle by singing the "Song of May." 
  At 1500 that afternoon, 300 students from Chonnam University 
and Choson University staged an on-street drama, reproducing the 
repression by the martial law troops in May 1980 and the 
resistance struggle of citizens. An international seminar on 
the Kwangju mass democratization resistance struggle viewed 
overseas was held at 1400 with the participation of figures from 
four foreign countries, including Japan and Thailand. 
  A rally for the resolution of Pusan citizens to probe the 
truth about the Kwangju resistance struggle was held at 1430 
that afternoon with the participation of about 200 students and 
citizens. 
  Since a broad range of students and people rose in the 
struggle throughout South Korea, the Kim Yong-sam group 
mobilized enormous police forces and placed them under the 
posture of alertness, thus creating a terrorism-ridden 
atmosphere.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- If the South Korean 
people want to punish the chief culprits in the Kwangju 
bloodbath, they must overthrow the "civilian regime" of the 
traitor Kim Yong-sam, too, urges NODONG SINMUN in a commentary 
today. 
  The analyst says: 
  On the threshold of the 14th anniversary of the Kwangju 
popular uprising, the federation of the May 18 Kwangju popular 
resistance of South Korea came out with the demand for the 
punishment of the traitor Chon Tu-hwan and other chief culprits 
of the Kwangju massacre. 
  The Kwangju bloodbath which was unprecedented in barbarity, 
atrocity and ferocity, left in the hearts of the people 
unquenchable grievances. But the demand of the people for a 
probe into the truth of the incident and the punishment of the 
chief murderers has not yet been met. 
  No Tae-u the puppet, the dictator of the "Sixth Republic," 
had "committed" himself to the solution of this problem before 
he took office. But, he himself being a mastermind of the 
Kwangju massacre, he hushed it up. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam who made "a fair solution of the 
Kwangju problem" one of his "commitments" when taking power, 
connived at and defended the criminals and bloodily cracked down 
on the massive struggle of students and people demanding a probe 
into the truth and punishment of the chief murderers by letting 
loose hundreds of thousands of police. 
  Kim Yong-sam the traitor says quite often that he was "a 
victim of the military dictatorship." But he is a turncoat and 
political prostitute who made a strategic marriage with the 
military dictatorial forces and clawed his way to power with 
their backing. 
  The punishment of the chief culprits in the Kwangju massacre 
is impossible with the Kim Yong-sam group, the "civilian 
fascists" defending the Kwangju murderers, left alone.

demanding the investigation into the Kwangju massacre and the 
punishment of those responsible for it, a Seoul-based radio

  Noting that the truth behind the massacre has not yet been

those responsible for it including two former "presidents," Chon 
Tu-hwan and No Tae-u. 
  After the rally, they went out of the campus demanding the

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- Pak Tae-ho, chairman of 
the Central Committee of the Korean Buddhists Federation [KBF], 
released a statement on May 14 urging the South Korean puppets 
to scrap the pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) and the 
multi-purpose research reactor, stop the development of a fast 
breeder reactor and promptly give up the nuclear arms 
development. 
  He said the PHWR in Wolsong which the South Korean puppets 
claim to be a "commercial" reactor and the multi-purpose 
research reactor in the Taedok complex which they call a 
"research" reactor were designed to develop nuclear weapons. 
  "The Buddhists, who consider killing as the blackest crime 
against mankind and peace as the greatest charity, will never 
tolerate their nuclear arms development for plunging the nation 
into a nuclear disaster," he declared. 
  "The KBF Central Committee calls on the Korean Buddhists in 
the South and overseas to actively join in the struggle for 
checking the South Korean puppets' nuclear arms development and 
getting the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South 
Korea, thus fully discharging the mission and duty of Buddhists, 
who consider avoiding sin of killing any living creature most 
important in the Buddhist commandments. [no closing quotation

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today says 
the recently exposed concealment of pure plutonium enough for 
the manufacture of nine nuclear bombs in Japan shows its 
shamelessness and craftiness. 
  The analyst says: 
  It was for the purpose of veiling its nuclear arms 
development that Japan spread the rumor that North Korea had 
manufactured nuclear weapons, crying for international pressure 
and sanctions against it. 
  The reality clearly indicates that the nuclear threat does 
not comes to Japan from the DPRK but comes to the latter from 
the former, assuming a very serious nature. 
  With Japan accelerating nuclear armament, the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would be meaningless 
and the joint declaration on denuclearization signed between the 
North and the South of Korea would be a dead duck. 
  Japan's concealment of plutonium was disclosed for the first 
time. 
  It was from several dozen years ago that Japan put its first 
nuclear facilities into operation. Nobody knows how much 
plutonium Japan has systematically concealed in this period. 
  The Japanese authorities have vaunted that Japan was "a 
model" in accepting inspections of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, claiming that the inspection of the DPRK was 
"insufficient" and it must accept "an additional inspection." 
  This was a crafty trick to dull the strictness of the 
agency's inspection of Japan and make it to keep a sharp watch 
on the DPRK so that the plutonium concealed by Japan 
systematically might not be uncovered. 
  The more desperately Japan provokes the DPRK the more fully 
the latter's transparency will be proved and the clearer Japan's 
sinister, shameless intention be revealed.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities 
are under the legal obligations to fully ensure the activities 
of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon) and the democratic national rights of Koreans in 
Japan, stresses NODONG SINMUN today. 
  A by-lined article of the paper says: 
  It is a principled requirement of international law and 
usage 
that overseas citizens of a sovereign state lead a free life, 
enjoying legal protection and treatment as foreigners under the 
protection of their motherland, wherever they may reside. 
  The Japanese authorities must provide the Koreans in Japan 
with all lawful rights and treatment as foreigners and fully 
ensure their human rights in accordance with the publicly 
accepted principles of international law and usage. 
  The Japanese authorities are also under historical and moral 
obligations to fully ensure the activities of Chongnyon and the 
democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan. 
  They must properly repent of and apologize for the crimes 
committed by Japanese imperialism against history and they must 
know that they are under the heavy obligation to ensure the 
democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan in order to atone 
for the crimes. 
  The Japanese authorities must provide them with all rights 
including the right to learn, work and lead a dignified life and 
the freedom of political activity, speech, the press, 
association, assembly and demonstration in Japan. 
  The Japanese authorities must fully guarantee the human 
rights of Koreans in Japan to respect at least the basic spirit 
of the world declaration on human rights and the international 
statutes of human rights they signed and to abide by the 
"principle of equality between natives and foreigners" to which 
they are committed. 
  We who regard the dignity of the country and the nation as 
our life and soul will sternly counter any persecution and 
repression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, considering them 
to be an infringement on the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK. 
  The Japanese authorities must immediately stop and apologize 
for their hostile policy toward the DPRK and the anti-Chongnyon 
campaign, mindful of grave consequences arising from their 
reckless action, and must take responsible measures lest 
repression of Chongnyon and violations of human rights of 
Koreans in Japan should recur.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 13 (KNS-KCNA) -- A forum on human rights 
of Koreans in Japan sent a message on May 12 to the prime 
minister, the chairman of the state security committee, the 
director of the police agency and the chief of the Osaka 
prefectural police headquarters of Japan protesting the 
unprecedented outrages of the Japanese police authorities 
against the Osaka prefectural headquarters of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and its 
branches. 
  The forum in the message denounced the forcible search by 
the 
Osaka prefectural police on the Osaka prefectural headquarters 
of Chongnyon and its branches as a wanton encroachment on the 
freedom and human rights of Koreans in Japan. 
  The message strongly demanded an immediate stop to the 
political suppression, watch and violation of human rights of 
the Chongnyon organisations and Koreans in Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- The Central Standing 
Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) sent an appeal to the compatriots affiliated 
with the "ROK Residents Association in Japan" (Mindan) on May 
12, urging it to promote national unity for defense of national 
dignity and vital rights of the Koreans in Japan. 
  Noting that the persecution and suppression of Koreans in 
Japan and Chongnyon organisations by the Japanese reactionaries 
today are by no means confined to Chongnyon, the appeal says: 
  Militarism does not distinguish between Chongnyon and 
"Mindan" and between the North and the South of Korea. We 
cannot and must not allow the past history of humiliation and 
shame to be repeated, falling a prey to the malicious scheme of 
the Japanese militarist forces to sow discord within our nation. 
  There is only one way for the Korean nationals in Japan to 
survive, defending national dignity and rights--a close unity of 
the nation. 
  We are sending this appeal to you, loudly asserting that it 
is high time all the Koreans in Japan closely united, sharply 
watching the heinous militarist ambition of the Japanese 
reactionary forces against Korea and their possible nation 
alienating maneuvers. 
  Let us all unite as fellow countrymen, irrespective of isms 
and views and affiliation, defend the dignity of the nation and 
the vital rights of the compatriots in Japan and guarantee the 
future of our dear younger generations. 
  Let us achieve national reunification in the 1990s without 
fail by uniting as fellow countrymen of the same ancestry, 
priding ourselves on our long history spanning 50 centuries.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 14 (KNS-KCNA) -- A Kinki District meeting 
of Koreans in Japan was held in Osaka on May 13 to denounce the 
suppression of the Osaka organisation of the General Association 
of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and national 
persecution by the Japanese authorities. 
  Addressing the meeting, vice chairman of Chongnyon O 
Hyong-chin said that the recent outrage is part of the anti-DPRK 
campaign of the U.S., Japanese and South Korean reactionaries 
over the fictitious "nuclear suspicion" against the North and an 
attempt to destroy the patriotic activities of Chongnyon. 
  "It cannot be overlooked that the Japanese reactionaries, 
far 
from repenting of their past Asian aggression, are trying to 
turn Japan back to the road of militarism and purposefully 
inciting among the Japanese people national chauvinism and ill 
feelings against the Koreans in Japan," he said. 
  He strongly demanded that the Japanese police immediately 
stop unreasonable political suppression of Chongnyon and 
apologize for it. 
  At the meeting Japanese guests made speeches of solidarity 
and participants delivered indignation speeches. 
  A letter of protest was adopted and a protest group was 
formed to hand it to the Osaka prefectural police headquarters 
and the Higashi police station. 
  After the meeting the participants staged a powerful street 
demonstration.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Kim 
Chong-su, chairman of the Association of Koreans in Japan for 
Peaceful Reunification, published a statement Wednesday, in 
which he branded the criminal acts of the South Korean 
authorities in opposing the proposed convocation of national 
conference and rushing headlong towards war against the fellow 
countrymen as a challenge to the entire nation desirous of 
reconciliation, unity and reunification and a full disclosure of 
their color as flunkeyist traitors seeking only confrontation 
and division and war against the North. 
  "If the South Korean authorities have the intention to 
achieve peaceful reunification," he said, "they must no more do 
acts upsetting the expectation of the entire fellow countrymen 
for a convocation of national conference." 
  "They must also stop at once the criminal war moves intended 
to annihilate the fellow countrymen in league with outside 
forces", he demanded.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- A statement demanding 
early normalization of Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations was 
adopted at an inaugural meeting of the National Interchange 
Society of Listeners to Radio Pyongyang, which was held in Osaka 
on April 17. 
  The statement demanded that the Japanese Government rectify 
the external policy, with which it, following the U.S. Korea 
policy, has been hostile to the DPRK and joined in freezing the 
division of the Korean peninsula. 
  For Japan to normalize diplomatic relations with the DPRK is 
to put an end to the past hostile relations and make a true 
international contribution, the statement said, and stressed: 
  The Japanese Government should normalize Japan-Korea 
diplomatic relations, not clamouring for "sanctions" against the 
DPRK. 
  The statement urged the Japanese Government to respect the 
spirit of the joint declaration published by the Liberal 
Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party of Japan and the 
Workers' Party of Korea on September 28, 1990, and propel 
negotiations for the normalization of Japan-Korea diplomatic 
relations in this spirit. 
  "The members of the National Interchange Society of 
Listeners 
to Radio Pyongyang will conduct a more energetic movement to 
realize negotiations for the normalization of Japan-Korea 
diplomatic relations," it declared.

  The statement urged that the United States should 
discontinue 
the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises for good, withdraw 
its forces from South Korea and sign a peace agreement with the 
DPRK through talks with it. 
  Speaking at the sixth Kennan, Ibaraki Prefecture,

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- Korean residents in 
Russia published statements denouncing the South Korean 
authorities' scheme to drag compatriots in Sakhalin, Russia, 
into South Korea through conspiracy and tieup with the Japanese 
Government. 
  The chief of the Organization of Korean Nationals in 
Sakhalin, Chae Chong-man, said Koreans' immigration into 
Sakhalin from their dear homeland was caused by the Japanese 
imperialists' criminal act of aggression in the past, so it is a 
political issue under any circumstances, not a pure 
"humanitarian" issue as the South Korean puppet authorities 
allege, nor a matter to be settled with some money. 
  "The South Korean puppet authorities' scheme to forcibly 
take 
compatriots in Sakhalin to South Korea is aimed at fomenting 
discord and consciousness of confrontation within the Korean 
nation and perpetuating the division of the country," he 
contended. 
  The chairman of the Sakhalin Regional Committee of Koreans 
for Support to Peaceful Reunification, Kwon Chon-sik, warned 
that if the South Korean authorities persist in their plot to 
drag away compatriots through tieup with the Japanese 
authorities, they would be held entirely responsible for the 
consequences arising therefrom. 
  The chief of the Organization of Korean Nationals in Russia, 
Choe Yong-su, said Korean residents in Russia would make every 
possible effort for a peaceful reunification of the country and 
national unity and fight against the South Korean authorities' 
anti-popular policy and for peace on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Moscow, May 12 (KCNA) -- A scientific symposium on 
the reunification of Korea was held here today. 
  Speeches were made on the subjects of "formation of 'two 
Koreas'", "present status of the Korean question and prospect of 
its settlement" and so on. 
  The speakers pointed out that the division of Korea, a 
product of the "cold war", was caused by the moves of big 
powers, the United States in particular. 
  They said that President Kim Il-song called a joint 
conference of political parties and public organizations in the 
North and the South of Korea to prevent the division of the 
country, initiated building a democratic unified state and later 
put forward the three principles of national reunification, the 
proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of 
Koryo and 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation, thus opening a bright vista for the reunification of the 
country. 
  They noted that the proposal for reunification through 
confederacy and the 10-point programme, advanced by President 
Kim Il-song, are a reunification proposal acceptable to

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- Papers here today carry 
articles upon the beginning of "the week of support to the 
struggle of the Palestinian people." 
  Stating that various forms of activities supporting the just 
cause of the Palestinian people and expressing solidarity with 
it will take place in Korea during the week, NODONG SINMUN says: 
  The Korean people have consistently supported the 
Palestinian 
people's struggle for retaking the lost territories and 
restoring their legitimate national rights. 
  The agreement on Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho 
signed between Palestine and Israel on May 4 was a fruition of 
the Palestinian people's patient efforts. 
  If the Palestinian issue is to be finally resolved, Israel 
must completely withdraw from the occupied lands. The master of 
the Palestinian issue is the Palestinian people themselves. The 
Korean people hope that the agreement will serve as a foundation 
for the founding of an independent state. 
  MINJU CHOSON declares that the Korean people will as ever 
fully support the just cause of the Palestinian people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- The League of Socialist 
Working Youth of Korea [LSWYK] and the Tanzanian Youth Union 
[TYU] released a joint statement here on May 13. 
  According to the statement, officials of the Central 
Committee of the LSWYK and the members of the visiting 
delegation of the TYU led by General Secretary Sukuwa S. Sukuwa 
exchanged views on a series of matters. 
  The statement says: 
  The sides informed each other of their organizations' 
activities and exchanged views on the development of friendly 
relations between the two youth organizations, the current 
international situation and the development of the world youth 
and student movement. 
  The LSWYK noted with appreciation that the TYU has played an 
important role and conducted brisk activities to build a new 
independent society and consolidate the unity of the nation and 
the country under the leadership of the Revolutionary Party of 
Tanzania, maintaining the line of socialism and self-reliance. 
  The TYU highly estimated the fact that the LSWYK, united in 
one mind around the great leader of the Korean people Comrade 
Kim Il- song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, has 
successfully discharged its mission and role in the struggle for 
defending the Workers' Party of Korea and confidently 
safeguarding and advancing the cause of socialism in the hard 
time when the imperialists continue anti-socialist, anti-DPRK 
moves. 
  The TYU bitterly denounced the United States and its 
satellites for deploying Patriot missiles in South Korea and 
rendering the situation of the Korean peninsula extremely 
strained, while threatening sanctions against the DPRK through 
the International Atomic Energy Agency and the United Nations 
under the pretext of "the nuclear issue," and urged them to 
promptly stop such moves. 
  The sides emphasized the need to support and closely 
cooperate with each other in the common struggle for the 
development of the world youth movement for solidarity against 
imperialism and for peace and friendship and the cause of 
socialism.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate articles to the 20th anniversary of the establishment 
of diplomatic relations between the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea and the Kingdom of Nepal (May 15, 1974). 
  NODONG SINMUN says that over the past two decades, the 
friendly and cooperative relations between the two peoples have 
developed favourably, which has been conducive to the building 
of a new life in the two countries. 
  The paper further says: 
  Today the Nepalese people are working hard to defend the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and develop 
the national economy. 
  The Kingdom of Nepal is striving to strengthen international 
cooperation, maintaining an independent stand and the principle 
of the non-aligned movement in external relations. 
  The Korean people are sincerely rejoiced over the 
achievements made by the Nepalese people in the building of a 
new life. 
  Further developing the friendly and cooperative relations 
between Korea and Nepal is beneficial not only to the building 
of a new society in the two countries but also to the building 
of a new Asia independent and prospering. 
  MINJU CHOSON says the Korean people will as ever make 
strenuous efforts to develop friendship and cooperation with the 
Nepalese people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- A general meeting of the 
Wiener-Neustadt branch of the society for the promotion of the 
relations between Austria and the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea was held on May 5. 
  At the meeting the chairman of the branch reviewed the 
achievements and experience the branch has made in its 
activities over the past 15 years. 
  Referring to the vicious anti-DPRK campaign launched by the 
United States and its followers with a row over nuclear 
suspicion to stifle the DPRK, a socialist state, he said they 
always stand on the side of the Korean people. 
  "We will fully support the Korean people in the just 
struggle 
for national reunification and strive to further expand and 
develop the many-sided friendly and cooperative relations 
between the peoples of Austria and Korea," he declared.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The Burundian parliament 
expressed support to the memorandum of the DPRK Foreign Ministry 
dated April 20 which threw light on the main obstacle to the 
solution of the nuclear issue and truth behind it. 
  In its note to the DPRK Embassy in Burundi, it said that the 
threat to and pressure on an independent state by big powers are 
a crude violation of international law and a big obstacle to 
peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the world. It 
expressed solidarity and support to the stand and efforts of the 
DPRK to resolve the nuclear problem through its peaceful 
negotiation with the United States. 
  It called upon international organisations not to cling to a 
double-standard policy, blindly following the big powers, but 
act according to their ideas and reaffirmed undisputed support 
to the Korean people's struggle for the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The Political Bureau of 
the Congolese Socialist Party on May 5 published an appeal on 
the grave situation created in the Korean peninsula. 
  Recalling that the United States has turned South Korea into 
a nuclear depot filled with mass destruction weapons including 
more than 1,000 nuclear weapons, grossly violating the Korean 
Armistice Agreement, the appeal said: 
  "The DPRK's proposal for negotiation to replace the nominal 
Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement and establish a new 
peace- keeping arrangement is a most fair measure for removing 
the hostile relations between the DPRK and the United States and 
realising negotiation." 
  Expressing the hope that DPRK-USA negotiation would be 
realized in a short time and measures be taken for bringing a 
lasting peace on the Korean peninsula where the situation has 
reached the brink of war, the appeal urged the U.S. Government 
to substantially contribute to world peace.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The members of a 
delegation of the Turkish Association for friendship with the 
People of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were 
interviewed during their stay here. They said though threat and 
pressure of outside forces against the DPRK have been 
intensified, the Korean people have registered tremendous 
achievements in socialist construction. 
  Member of parliament Ali Ibrahim Tutu said after visiting 
the 
construction site of the Rungna suspension bridge: 
  "I was deeply impressed by the sight of soldiers engaged in 
peaceful construction with safety helmets and welders, not 
military helmets and rifles. Though the mass media of the West 
are alleging that Korea is making war preparations on an 
extensive scale, they can never cover up the truth." 
  He said he was deeply moved by the strong spirit of the 
Korean people, who were doing their business with courage and 
composure even in a serious confrontation with the imperialists. 
  Mayor Gurbuz Capan of Esenyurt City, Istanbul, said after 
visiting the Mangyongdae school children's palace that he could 
see the happiness and the bright future of the Korean people 
through the beaming faces of children. 
  Noting that the Korean people without worries about food and 
clothing are granted excellent benefits and conditions by the 
state in educating and bringing up children, he stressed that 
Korea is an earthly paradise, a country of the people. 
  Female lawyer Senal Sarihan said Korea that has successfully 
built socialism is the ideological support to her. 
  Pointing out that Korea is a model for the world people 
aspiring after a new life, she stressed that the press circles 
of the West captive to prejudice must regain reason and 
properly look at and represent the reality.

Kim Chong-il sent a centennial birthday table to Pak Yong-sun, 
an old woman residing in neighborhood unit No. 24 in 
Toksong-tong, Tokchon City, South Pyongan Province. 
  Born into a poor peasant's family in Kongju County, South 
Chungchong Province, she underwent all hardships as a nurse-maid 
at a landlord's home from early years and then a tenant farmer. 
  It was not until she was embraced in the bosom of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea after the country's 
liberation that she could enjoy a worthy life of humanity. She 
actively participated in assisting the front in the period of 
the fatherland liberation war (1950-1953) and afterwards 
devotedly worked for the strengthening and development of the 
socialist motherland. 
  She is now the oldest woman in a big family of 50 members 
including her sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters. 
  All people in the DPRK are now living a happy life with no 
worry about food, clothing and housing, singing the prime of 
youth in the sixties and the first step into old age in the 
nineties, benefitting by the free health care system.

Kim Chong-il received a letter from Min Su-yong, a four-year-old 
girl of the Kuchon kindergarten, Sariwon city, the seat of North 
Hwanghae Province near Pyongyang, and sent the following 
autographic letter to her: 
  "I hope you will become a good student. 
  April 27, 1994 
  Kim Chong-il" 
  In her letter to Comrade Kim Chong-il Min Su-yong said: 
  "Dear leader, I have appeared on TV twice because I was good 
at composition, word contest and diary writing. 
  "My kindergartener felt very proud of this, saying if I 
appeared on TV, the dear leader would be pleased to see me. 
  "So, I have dreamed of being received by you. And I am going 
to keep diaries in a fair handwriting in the hope of having them 
read by you." 
  Min Su-yong is very inquisitive and has a good memory. She 
began to read books and learn composition from the age of 3. 
  In compliance with the party's intention to systematically 
educate children with rare aptitude and talent, the Kuchon 
kindergarten taught the three-year-old girl how to read and 
write the mother tongue in various forms and ways. It also 
taught the girl with keen observation and imagination how to 
properly see and judge things. 
  With her composition capacity increasing gradually, she was 
able to write to Yi In-mo, the incarnation of the faith and 
will, and to soldiers of the People's Army and kept diaries 
fairly, deeply impressing people. 
  Upon receiving the autographic letter of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, Min Su-yong vowed to study hard with brothers and 
sisters and become a good little writer.

<F P=106> ["Famous Work That Greatly Contributed To Defending and </F>
Exalting Cause of Korean-style Socialism" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN Sunday 
carried an article contributed by Major General of the Korean 
People's Security Forces Yi Chun-kon, a hero of the Republic, on 
the 6th anniversary of the publication of "Let Us All Live and 
Struggle Like Heroes," an immortal famous work of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, in May 1988. 
  The work gives comprehensive answers to all the questions 
arising in making the whole country overflow with the morale of 
heroic struggle and constantly giving full play to the tradition 
of heroic struggle of the Korean people. 
  The article says: 
  Living and struggling like heroes means working with all 
devotion for the revolutionary cause of the illustrious leader, 
the cause of socialism, not for personal interests and fame. 
  Since its publication, the work has displayed great vitality 
in the practice of revolution. 
  The validity and vitality of the work finds clear 
manifestation, firsts of all, in that the Korean people are 
staunchly defending the revolutionary cause of chuche, 
frustrating all manner of challenges and aggressive moves of the 
imperialists. 
  They are resolutely upholding the banner of socialism by 
fully displaying the heroic fighting spirit and traits with an 
unshakable faith in the socialist cause of chuche. 
  The validity and vitality of the work also finds clear 
manifestation in that the Korean people are consolidating and 
developing Korean-style socialism by effecting a constant 
upsurge in the revolution and construction through an all-people 
heroic struggle. 
  With the chuche-orientation, modernization and 
scientification of the national economy, a strategic line of 
socialist economic construction, accelerated successfully, the 
nation's economy has been further strengthened as an independent 
socialist national economy with all its sections including 
industry and agriculture equipped with modern technologies and 
the departmental structures rounded off. 
  The officers and men of the People's Army and the People's 
Security Forces have brought about an unprecedented renovative 
upswing in combat and political training and construction of 
major projects, upholding the idea and intention of supreme 
commander General Kim Chong-il on living and fighting like 
heroes. 
  The Korean people and all the soldiers will as ever cherish

  [Text] Upholding the party's agriculture-first policy, 
soldiers who completed service from the Korea People's Army unit 
to which Comrade Kim Chong-yol belongs volunteered to advance to 
Pongnae Cooperative Farm in Pyonggang County with a resolve to 
uphold our party by increasing the grain production. 
  The farmers enthusiastically welcomed them upon their 
arrival 
in the farm. 
  [Officer Hwang Myong-chin, identified by caption] The 10 
comrade party members, who completed service at our unit, have 
advanced in a group to Pongnae Cooperative Farm, Pyonggang 
County located along the demarcation line bearing the deep trust 
and love of the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander 
General Kim Chong-il. During their entire military service, the 
officers showed examples in carrying out revolutionary duties 
better than any others. 
  After the service, these comrades could have entered 
colleges, returned to their beloved hometowns, or deployed to 
important revolutionary outposts where they could display feats. 
But they ran to the fields of the cooperative farm with the 
single will of displaying feats of youth in the construction of 
socialist cultural farms, which is our party's first wish at 
present. 
  [Discharged soldier Hwang Won-kun] Blessed by tens of 
thousands of people, the hearts of every one of us who ran to 
Pongnae Cooperative Farm located along the demarcation line, are 
burning with new hope. Fields of socialist cooperative farms. 
What a rewarding work site! 
  [Discharged soldier Hyon Myong-kwan] That's right. From 
today, we the 10 discharged soldier-party members will settle 
down in this cooperative field forever and unsparingly dedicate 
our sweats of loyalty. We are not simply discharged soldiers. 
Upholding the far-seeing plan of the respected and beloved 
comrade supreme commander, we are the brilliant soldiers of the 
entire country, who are running to new front lines and new 
outposts . 
  Therefore, every one of us will become a cell party member 
here at a unit of Pongnae Cooperative Farm. As did the 
revolutionary party members of Nagwon in the past days of the 
fatherland liberation war, we will become 10 party members of 
socialist farms, and add luster to our lives as reliable masters 
and persons truly in charge of the construction of socialist 
cultural farms, which are better places to live in. 
  [Village party secretary Kim Ho-kyu] How reliable and 
presentable are they? We thank the respected and beloved 
comrade supreme commander and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, who fostered the excellent discharged soldier-party 
members. We will help the 10 valuable discharged soldier-party 
members so that they become true heroes and reliable persons in 
charge of the construction of socialist cultural farms.

<F P=106> ["Article" by (R. J. Strider) and Pyone Cho] </F>
  [Text] The February issue of MYETKHIN THIT journal, 
published by the intelligence service of SLORC [State Law and 
Order Restoration Council], contains language detrimental to the 
prestige of Thai Crown Princess Mahachakri Sirinthon, and has 
caused embarrassment to the SLORC. 
  On page 135 of issue no. 46 is an article in the form of a 
dialogue between a Vietnamese national, (Nguyen Nge) and a 
Burmese national, (Saw Indei). The dialogue contains terms 
insulting to Thai Princess Mahachakri Sirinthon, daughter of the 
Thai king. It makes references to Mahachakri Sirinthon being 
world-famous for being born as a daughter of the Thai king. It 
contains references saying that had she been born of a 
(?Burmese) peasant, Sirinthon may well have been a prostitute. 
  The same article says prostitution has become a traditional 
source of livelihood in Thailand and that Thailand is achieving 
a high standard of living through prostitution and that the 
revolutionary trait has disappeared. If such a rude reference 
had been made to the daughter of the Thai king in Thailand, 
there would certainly be charges of lese majeste and harsh 
punishment. 
  Such an article could not have been published without 
official authorization in Burma, where there are strict 
censorship rules and the Army strictly controls the publication 
of journals. MYETKHIN THIT has been published by the SLORC 
since 1990 and has been used to blatantly attack democratic 
forces inside and outside the country, political leaders, 
foreign countries, and Western diplomats. 
  Po Kan Kaung's article in the February issue of MYETKHIN 
THIT 
journal has surprised many Burmese observers because relations 
between Thailand and Burma have been good. Thailand, which has 
been enjoying special privileges in timber and fishery 
concessions, has been opposing international efforts to isolate 
the SLORC. Lately, the SLORC, which has been expanding economic 
relations with other countries, including Singapore, has accused 
Thai businessmen of illegal fishing and logging. 
  It is possible that the article, which contains crude 
language, may well reflect the SLORC government's displeasure 
with the Thais. The article also contains references that could 
damage the prestige of the Thai military. The article says that 
since the end of World War II, Thailand has been instrumental in 
spreading U.S. imperialism in Southeast Asia, and that the Thai 
Armed Forces have been under the patronage of the U.S. Army. 
While the Burmese and the Vietnamese Defense Services were 
discharging their national duty, the Thai Armed Forces lacked 
revolutionary characteristics. 
  Despite the allegations made by MYETKHIN THIT, there has 
been 
a surprising lack of reaction from the Thai Armed Forces and 
entrepreneurs. 
  According to one source, although Thai military intelligence 
obtained the article, they suppressed the report to prevent it 
from leaking to the Thai public. It can be seen that although 
the Burmese generals are insulting the prestige of Thailand, 
Thai military officials are remaining silent over the matter for 
their own self-interest.

<F P=106> [Interview with new Justice Minister Hiroshi Nakai by an </F>
unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Former Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano resigned because of his remarks on the Japan-China war. 
  [Nakai] There is no doubt that after invading Nanjing, the 
former Japanese army committed cruel deeds on ordinary Chinese 
people. Japan has to have a feeling of deep remorse and apology 
not only for the Nanjing massacre, but also for its numerous 
acts of aggression and colonial rule during the war. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to deal with severe 
criticism from various countries about Nagano's remarks? 
  [Nakai] The justice minister is not in a position to take 
diplomatic action. But Nagano's remarks disgraced Japan's 
diplomacy and inflicted mental scars on many peoples. 
Therefore, as a successor to Nagano, I would like to take care 
of this issue if the prime minister asks me to do so. Mr. 
Nagano, however, took responsibility for causing trouble to the 
nation and the cabinet. I think, with his resignation, other 
countries will understand Japan's view of the war. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Defense Agency Director General Kanda 
recently made remarks in favor of exercising the right to 
collective defense. Foreign Minister Kakizawa also expressed a 
positive stance on enacting legislation for emergencies. 
  [Nakai] It is quite right that Dietmen and the people voice 
various different views on the Constitution and other issues. 
But as a cabinet member, I have to protect the Constitution and 
respect its longstanding interpretation by previous governments. 
I have no intention to make comments on and participate in the 
constitutional arguments as justice minister. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the power of the 
justice minister over the public prosecutor general? 
  [Nakai] I am fully aware that the authority is stipulated by 
law. But I have no intention to take action to intervene in 
individual problems. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Currently, such basic laws as the civil 
law are being reviewed. 
  [Nakai] Things are changing at a rapid pace. Sense of value 
has also changed greatly. While considering this, the 
government should, if necessary, revise laws by seeking a 
national consensus and through in-depth discussions.

  [Text] Of all people, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi 
Kumagai, who is known to be the closest aide to Ichiro Ozawa, 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] secretary general, has recently 
and repeatedly been noted making "sour remarks" about Ozawa. 
Kumagai has said: "He has great strategies, but no tactics; he 
tends to fail to explain matters fully; and he often makes big 
mistakes." Such remarks are expected to arouse speculation 
regarding the chief cabinet secretary's true intentions. 
However, the Prime Minister's Office, which has been bothered 
by critics who attack the current administration for its "dual 
power structure" and its "hawkish nature," apparently hopes to 
ward off such attacks. 
  Regarding the "dual power structure," the fact that Kumagai 
fills the post of chief cabinet secretary as head of the Prime 
Minister's Office in itself has been a target of the 
administration's critics. They feel "this proves that Ozawa is 
in control" (as stated by a senior official of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP]). 
  Therefore, Kumagai has frequently tried to emphasize that he 
is not in complete agreement with Ozawa. In an appearance on a 
commercial television program on 13 May, Kumagai even said, 
"There have been times when I did not speak with him for many 
months." In this way, he has tried hard to give the impression 
that he is not really that close to Ozawa. 
  The "hawkish nature" of the administration has been 
attributed to Ozawa's public image, because he believes that 
"sending Self-Defense Forces [SDF] personnel to participate in 
UN forces is constitutional." In this regard, Kumagai explains: 
"Mr. Ozawa is only saying that the SDF could participate in UN 
forces, which actually have not yet been organized. It is 
merely an idea. Mr. Ozawa has said that, under the current 
Constitution, Japan cannot exercise the right of collective 
security." Moreover, Kumagai has stressed that the current 
administration does not have to listen to Ozawa on the issue of 
an international contribution. In this way, he has tried to 
strengthen the administration's soft-line policy. 
  Regarding Kumagai's "declaration of independence from 
Ozawa," 
an LDP official who is well aware of the relations between Ozawa 
and Kumagai said: "The fact that Mr. Kumagai can make such sour 
remarks about Mr. Ozawa proves that he is very close to Ozawa. 
Continuing to make remarks which refer to Ozawa conversely 
proves that Ozawa is in control." Thus, it seems uncertain 
whether Kumagai's strategy will bring about favorable results.

  [Text] On 9 May, the Agency of Natural Resources and 
Energy [ANRE] under the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] disclosed a plan to drastically revise the 
current nuclear fuel recycling policy aimed at securing the 
nation's own energy resources by increasing production of 
plutonium. The government's plan for a second reprocessing 
plant to produce plutonimum by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel 
will be given another review "in or around 2010 as to whether 
the plant is really needed." As for the enriched uranium plant 
now under construction in Rokkasho-mura, Aomori Prefecture, ANRE 
will freeze its second expansion plan which envisages producing 
1,500 tons of enriched uranium per year beginning in 2000. 
  By revising Japan's longstanding nuclear policy toward 
containing production and minimizing the amount of plutonium in 
stock, ANRE wants to show people at home and abroad that Japan 
will use plutonium only for peaceful purposes. 
  The ANRE will formally announce the policy revision after 
the 
Atomic Energy Division of the General Advisory Committee for 
Energy, an advisory panel to the MITI minister, makes a 
recommendation on the revision in its interim report to be 
compiled in June. The government's Atomic Energy Commission 
will then incorporate the revision into a new long-term atomic 
power program to be worked out this summer. 
  The ANRE decision on the revision stems from the realization 
that, with the world crying for a need to put a stop to nuclear 
proliferation as a result of North Korea's suspected nuclear 
arms program, it is difficult for Japan to obtain understanding 
at home and abroad on its nuclear policy, however hard the 
government may insist that it is strictly for peaceful purposes. 
Another reason is that the uranium supply is large enough to 
last until about 2020 or 2030. The agency has also taken into 
consideration the fact that the United States and Europe are 
reviewing their own nuclear fuel recycling policies. 
  However, as Japan is heavily dependent on energy resources 
from overseas, its basic nuclear fuel recycling policy will be 
maintained from the viewpoint of securing the nation's own 
energy resources. 
  As such, as far as a reprocessing plant for spent nuclear 
fuel is concerned, ongoing construction of the first plant (that 
can reprocess 800 tons of spent nuclear fuel a year) in 
Rukkasho-mura will be completed in 2000. But construction of a 
fast breeder reactor for demonstration purpose will be delayed 
from the late 1990's to the early 2000's. 
  The agency wants to dispel apprehensions about nuclear 
proliferation by reducing the amount of plutonium in stock. It 
will seek to reduce the volume of plutonium by burning it, for 
instance, by adopting the plutonium thermal system in the 
light-water reactors. It thus wants to set an international 
example in making peaceful use of nuclear power.

<F P=106> [Interview with Atsushi Kanda, Defense Agency director </F>
general, by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter on 11 May at the 
Defense Agency in Tokyo] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] In your first news conference as 
Defense Agency head, you stated the government may change its 
interpretation of the Constitution concerning the possible use 
of collective defensive rights over the suspicion on the DPRK's 
(North Korea's) nuclear weapons development. What is your 
comment right now? 
  [Kanda] The use of collective defensive rights is not 
allowed in Japan, and the Defense Agency should stick to the 
government's current stand on constitutional affairs. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you mean your remarks at the news 
conference were just your personal opinions? 
  [Kanda] No, I do not. At that time, I probably misled some 
of you by using inappropriate words. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also said he 
thinks the government should review its interpretation of the 
Constitution... 
  [Kanda interrupting] Everybody has his or her opinion on the 
Constitution because Japan is a democratic nation. Even in the 
future, various opinions will surface. Yet, the prime minister, 
the foreign minister, and other cabinet members met on 10 May to 
reconfirm the Hata administration's stance not to change the 
government's stance toward constitutional issues. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think the Japanese Government can 
adequately deal with future problems within the current 
interpretation of the Constitution? 
  [Kanda] That is right. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Kazuo Aichi, former Defense Agency director 
general, once said the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law may be 
revised within the framework of the Constitution. Do you have a 
definite plan for that? 
  [Kanda] I am not determined yet. Basically, we think it is 
preferable to seek a peaceful settlement by patiently persuading 
North Korea to accept inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Some quarters say, in the post-Cold War 
world, Japan should contribute more to the United States to 
ensure security in the Far East based on the Japan-U.S. Security 
Treaty. What is your opinion on that point? 
  [Kanda] Some people actually say the nature of the 
Japan-U.S. security alliance should be changed to catch up with 
trends in the post-Cold War period; however, it is still 
uncertain what the global framework for the post-Cold War period 
will be. In this sense, I still attach importance to the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Are you going to promote the "arms 
reduction" policy advocated by former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa? 
  [Kanda] The future direction of Japan's defense policy is 
being discussed at the government's advisory Defense Affairs 
Council, and I would like to hear the advisory panel's opinion. 
While the trend of disarmament is spreading over the world, 
Japan is still under certain military pressures in North East 
Asia. I would like to composedly deal with my tasks in view of 
various circumstances, rather than blindly going for arms 
increase or reduction policies. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] In 1995, the government should review the UN 
Peace Cooperation Law. Do you want to unfreeze a ban on SDF 
participation in UN peace enforcement forces? 
  [Kanda] Japan's participation in UN peace enforcement forces 
should be discussed as a long-term goal, but Japan must avoid 
use of military forces overseas. I personally take a prudent 
stance toward the issue. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The Hata administration was inaugurated as a 
minority government. What are the possible impacts on the 
defense policies? 
  [Kanda] To seek the Social Democratic Party of Japan's 
return to the coalition, I would like to leave room for 
negotiations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tomomitsu Oba, director of the Japan Center </F>
for International Finance, by reporter Hideyuki Konaka; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] The "Ad Hoc Committee on Foreign Financial 
Transaction Issues" of the Foreign Exchange Council chaired by 
Gaishi Hiraiwa will compile a report by June on the subject of 
"Integration of Domestic and Foreign Economies and Global 
Financial Transactions." Prior to that report, the ad hoc 
committee had engaged in a survey of changes in the role of the 
yen and activities of Japanese businesses in Southeast Asia, 
which is undergoing rapid economic expansion. An interview was 
conducted with Toshimitsu Oba, Japan Center for International 
Finance (JCIF) director and ad hoc committee chairman, who 
inspected the ASEAN nations of Thailand, Malaysia, and 
Singapore, and Hong Kong to seek information on the recent 
currency situation in those areas. 
  [Konaka] What sort of problems exist in markets of the 
Southeast Asian nations? 
  [Oba] The finance ministers of each of the nations are 
troubled by the high volume of capital outflow and inflow from 
abroad. Gross domestic product (GDP) of Thailand, Malaysia, and 
Singapore was growing at about 8-10 percent on the high side 
last year, but such growth supported a massive flow of capital 
into their stock markets from overseas, and stock prices doubled 
in the last year. However, once stock prices reached a 
profitable level, moves took place to reap the benefits and 
stock prices dropped substantially. 
  Government authorities of the various nations consider such 
huge movements of capital as detrimental to the smooth 
management of their economies and are exercising increasing 
interest in how they might restrain such capital movements. In 
some cases, they have the perception that controls are necessary 
and embrace views which are somewhat different from those of 
advanced nations. 
  [Konaka] Have there been any changes in situations 
concerning 
currency because of the evacuation of U.S. military forces? 
  [Oba] The various nations exercise care in ensuring that 
major fluctuations do not take place in dollar exchange rates 
because the dollar continues to play a prevalent role in that it 
is easy to procure and manage. In contrast, there is a tendency 
to avoid the yen which suffers from sharp changes in value 
against the dollar. The various governments have displayed 
sensitivity to a strong yen because of the fact that they hold 
major liabilities in yen-denominated debt instruments. ASEAN 
regional trade is in the process of increasing and you would 
think that greater use could be made of the various nations' 
currencies, but it seems that these nations do not favor the 
globalization of their currencies. I imagine that they take such 
a stance because globalization would impose a burden on their 
financial policies. 
  [Konaka] What do you think of Japanese corporate investments 
penetrating the local economies in the form of newly constructed 
factories? 
  [Oba] I visited a Japanese corporation's color television 
factory, but it was more modern than the company's domestic 
plants and its parts vendors had also located themselves in 
Southeast Asia. On the other hand, wages are low. For example, 
labor rates in Malaysia are 1/12th those in Japan, and in 
Singapore they are 1/7th of Japanese rates. In 1993, Japan 
became a net importer of color television sets and in some 
categories Japanese domestic plants are no longer competitive. 
Even the position of producing domestically that which is to be 
sold in Japan will probably have to undergo inevitable future 
modification. 
  [Konaka] However, what do you think of the seemingly 
unchanging Japanese trade surplus with Asia, even if local 
investments increase because of the strong yen? 
  [Oba] Ever since 1988, Japanese investments in manufacturing 
in Southeast Asia grew because of expansions in local production 
facilities. Initially, these investments were followed by 
increased exports of parts and materials, causing a phenomenon 
whereby exports grew instead of falling. If investments in 
manufacturing facilities take place after a strong yen, exports 
of parts and materials will not be restricted to 12 or 18 
months, which means that the impact of a strong yen will not be 
seen for about five years. For example, if corporate overseas 
investments were to accelerate with a dollar-yen exchange rate 
of $1 to 100 yen, effects will not be seen for another five 
years and the interim will witness a repeat of the vicious 
cycle. I believe the cause of the huge trade surplus has a more 
fundamental cause. 
  [Konaka] Are you saying that you question any efforts to 
reduce trade surpluses based on the strong yen? 
  [Oba] Yes. Up until now, it was felt that if manufacturing 
facilities were transferred overseas to places such as Asia, 
that the trade surplus would disappear. However, if we were to 
view the Southeast Asian regional example, we'd have to say that 
the formula does not necessarily apply. 
  The study objective of "integration of domestic and foreign 
economies," in the ad hoc committee report put another way 
addresses the globalization of economies and I believe we must 
view international trade issues of this nature not from the 
perspective of bilateral relationships, but from the perspective 
of individual regions. I realize we are speaking of a difficult 
technical approach, but I think if we were to examine economic 
flows on a detailed basis and conduct a detailed analysis, we 
just might come up with the desired answers.

  [Text] Sanyo Electric announced on 19 April that it will 
enter the lithium ion battery market on which attention has been 
focused as a key device for multimedia data terminals on par 
with liquid crystal. That is because it is anticipated that 
demand will quickly expand in the future as a power source for 
data terminals to handle portable telephones or multimedia. 
There have been new entries by Matsushita Battery, Japan Storage 
Battery, and others one after the other, and Sony and others in 
the lead are preparing to counter them by augmenting facilities 
capability. Currently, only Japanese manufacturers can supply 
lithium ion batteries. Not only domestic, but foreign electrical 
machinery manufacturer users have come into view, and they are 
prepared to spur development and mass production competition 
with lithium ion batteries as "the second liquid crystal." 
  Sanyo Electric began production of a cylindrical lithium 
battery at their Sumoto plant (Hyogo Prefecture) in April. The 
initial monthly production plan is 100,000 units, but they are 
investing 5-6 billion yen, setting up two special lines, and 
will additionally market a square battery. They aim for monthly 
production of 1 million units during the year. In addition to 
the nickel cadmium battery and nickel hydrogen battery which 
have been the mainstream charging batteries up to now, the 
company will make a strenuous effort in the future to supply 
lithium ion batteries for multimedia terminal equipment. 
  The idea of the company is that "the respective special 
characteristics are that the nickel cadmium battery is for 
equipment where a large discharge is necessary, the nickel 
hydrogen is large capacity, and the lithium ion battery is small 
and lightweight. The special characteristics differ according to 
equipment used, and we plan to segregate cultivation of demand 
by the three kinds of batteries" (Kennosuke Matsumura, manager 
Soft Energy Division). 
  Various companies, such as Matsushita Battery and Japan 
Storage Battery, have entered the lithium ion battery market one 
after the other. Yuasa also will begin shipment of a business 
card-size film-type lithium ion battery sample beginning this 
summer. Sharp also has already succeeded in development. With 
the recent start of production by Sanyo Electric, the various 
domestic entry manufacturing companies will be just about all 
present. 
  Sony, which was the first to succeed in commercializing the 
lithium ion battery, will up production capability 50 percent by 
the end of fiscal 1994 at the Koriyama plant (Koriyama city) of 
its production subsidiary Sony Energy Tech, and boost it from 
the current monthly 1 million unit production system to 1.5 
million units. That is because they have judged that OEM 
[original equipment manufacturing] supply as a power source for 
family videos, MD's (mini disks), portable telephones, and 
personal computer backups will further expand. So far, they have 
invested a little more than about 10 billion yen, but it is said 
that they "will introduce new facilities" as they discern demand 
trends (Shiro Takahashi, senior vice president, Energy Division, 
Recording Media and Energy Company). 
  AD Battery (Chiyoda, Tokyo; president, Takashi Shimada), a 
joint investment company of Toshiba and Asahi Chemical Industry, 
which is a leading manufacturer on a par with Sony, is building 
new facilities at their Horikawa-cho plant (Kawasaki city), and 
will boost monthly production capability from 400,000 units to 
1.6 million units all at once with this summer as the goal. 
Investment during fiscal 1994 is anticipated to amount to a 
total of 5 billion yen. 
  The company further increased capital from 1 billion yen to 
3.5 billion yen at the end of March, aimed at strengthening 
management. So far, investment has been 50-50 by Toshiba and 
Asahi Chemical Industry, but Toshiba Battery (Shinagawa, Tokyo; 
president, Jun Sasakura) has newly participated in 
capitalization. The investment ratio is 40 percent each for 
Toshiba and Asahi Chemical Industry, and 20 percent for Toshiba 
Battery, and the plan is "to begin preparations for full-scale 
supply," transferring the increase in capital to facilities 
investment (President Takashi Shimada).

  [Text] Nippon Electric Glass is expanding production 
capability for non-alkali thin sheet glass for TFT (thin film 
transistor) type liquid crystal display devices (LCD). It will 
convert the glass furnace at Takatsuki Works (Takatsuki-cho, 
Shiga Prefecture) which is producing glass for picture tubes to 
liquid crystal use during 1995. Increased production of over 
500,000 sheets per month is possible by this and combined with 
existing lines, production of over 1 million sheets per month 
will be possible. 
  Since the demand for liquid crystal panels for personal 
computers and word processors is increasing, they are hastening 
provision of a supply system. 
  Currently, Nippon Electric Glass is producing from 150,000 
to 
200,000 sheets of LCD thin sheet glass per month. 
  Since the production capability of the glass furnace will be 
about 500,000 sheets converted to thin sheet glass, up to now 
they had aimed at boosting the supply quantity in the form of 
augmenting precision processing equipment. Since the increase in 
demand is continuing, however, they have decided this time to 
convert to LCD use the melting furnace for picture tube glass at 
the Takatsuki Works, which has become a surplus facility along 
with the Malaysia move plan. 
  It is estimated that a surplus supply of 500,000 to 700,000 
sheets per month will be generated by this. 
  There also is a policy at the company to continue aggressive 
facilities investment of several billion yen a year in the LCD 
thin sheet glass business in the future, and the idea is to 
devise an aggressive production increase system matching market 
expansion.

  [Text] Fujitsu has decided on a plan to boost greatly the 
production ratio of new computer products put on sale during the 
fiscal year in fiscal 1994 to 60 percent, about double the 
existing amount on a money basis. Because the price collapse of 
existing products has been severe, it will shorten the cycle for 
improvement and introduction of products. It is viewed as a 
pause in emergency evacuation-type cost reductions such as 
reduction in number of parts which began with the recession and 
they have shifted to an offensive restructuring (business 
rebuilding). 
  Sales of the Fujitsu computer division amount to 70 percent 
(1.49 trillion yen for fiscal 1993 estimate) of total company 
sales (2.16 trillion yen for same), including software. The 
ratio occupied by products introduced during the fiscal year has 
advanced to 30 or 40 percent so far; in fiscal 1993 it was 35 
percent, but the plan for fiscal 1994 is to boost it to 60 
percent. 
  With downsizing (shift of demand to small machines) in the 
background, price competition has intensified for personal 
computers, work stations, and peripheral equipment and prices 
collapse easily. Because the profit margin becomes thin a few 
months after they go on sale, the company has decided to shorten 
the cycle of product improvement and introduction, centering on 
the small machine field to ensure earnings in fiscal 1994 and to 
shift to a policy of expanding new product production. The 
number of new products during a year, including improvements, 
normally amounts to over 1,000 items, but the idea is to 
increase them on a large scale in fiscal 1994. At the same time, 
they aim to extricate themselves from an earnings structure 
where nearly half the sales of the computer division is occupied 
by large machines and related products. 
  Fujitsu is affected by a high dependency on large machines 
for which demand has sharply decreased and ordinary profit fell 
to a deficit (8.7 billion yen) in the March 1993 quarter, but as 
a result of cost reductions such as expansion of overseas parts 
procurement advantageous to the high yen and integration and 
consolidation of machine types, prospects are that the March 
1994 quarter can secure an ordinary profit of 27 billion yen. 
They are making a full-scale reorganization of business sectors, 
taking advantage of the review of the computer division product 
introduction plan.

  [Text] Asahi Glass has jointly developed with English and 
French engineering companies a new method for using reinforced 
glass in external walls of buildings. Several sheets of 
two-meter-square plate glass are suspended by wire tied by 
special fittings that incorporate a bearing mechanism, and a 
special feature is that it appears to be one sheet of glass 
since there are no sash frames. It is different from regular 
plate glass at the company, and they will push sales to design 
offices via three engineering subsidiaries. Estimates are for 
sales of 2 billion yen the first year and 10 billion yen after 
five years. 
  It will be put on sale starting the 11th under the product 
name of "Ten Point." It was jointly developed with "Ove Arup" of 
England and "RFR" of France. Special fittings are installed in 
saucer-shaped holes opened in the four corners of 12-mm thick 
reinforced glass and the glass is tied together. A bearing 
mechanism is incorporated in the special fitting, forming a 
structure that will absorb glass "flexure" generated by wind and 
earthquakes. The special fittings are tied by stainless wire, 
which is bundled and fastened to a post. 
  The basic technology was developed by Peter Rice who is the 
director in charge of technology at Ove, and Asahi Glass 
introduced the technology four years ago, matching it to 
Japanese specifications such as no water leakage. It is said 
that it will not be destroyed even by an earthquake in the class 
of the Great Kanto Earthquake.

  [Text] Suzuki is going at a fast clip. Sales of the 
wagon-type light car "Wagon R" are favorable and they are making 
a good showing with a contemptuous glance at the sluggishness of 
major auto manufacturers such as Toyota Motor and Nissan Motor. 
Behind their all-of-a-sudden "small but shining" existence since 
the burst of the bubble is the "Suzuki-style" management 
strategy which has abandoned haphazard obsession with technology 
and promoted thorough cost reductions (Tsuguaki Seki, Hamamatsu 
Branch Office). 
  The representative types of auto for Suzuki are the "Wagon 
R," "Alto," and "Cervo." Actually, only the "upper part" of 
these three auto types, such as the body shape and interior are 
different. The "underparts" such as the drive which controls the 
running performance of the car are the same. About 70 percent of 
the total parts are shared. 
  Many of those in the industry say sarcastically that "they 
are no more than dress-up dolls." As a result of the thorough 
sharing of parts, however, the Wagon R, the lowest-priced auto 
type, has a low price on the level of 700,000 yen. For consumers 
with tight purse strings, it is a price that fully arouses a 
desire to buy. The secret of favorable sales lies here. 
  The initial monthly sales goal for the Wagon R was 5,000 
cars. Currently, it has reached a level of double that with 
monthly production of 10,000 cars. Since it went on sale in the 
fall of 1993, they have sold about 44,000 cars in a period of 
half a year. It is popular, taking two months from order to 
delivery in one's hands. 
  The sharing of parts is also linked to improving the 
capacity 
utilization rate of their production base, the Kosai No. 1 plant 
(Shizuoka Prefecture). That is because the underparts of the 
three auto types are built on the same production line. The 
number of cars produced has decreased for the Alto and Cervo 
where over three years have passed since they went on sale. 
However, combined with the favorable Wagon R, the capacity 
utilization rate has improved. Naturally, costs can be reduced. 
The sales policy also is clear and markdowns for cars that 
cannot be sold are quick. An example is the sports type light 
car "Cara" that has been OEM [original equipment manufacturer] 
supplied from Mazda. Because sales performance has been sluggish 
at 10 percent of the goal, they have decided to stop sales this 
fall, two years after it went on sale. 
  The Suzuki-style management strategy does not much emphasize 
technology such as performance or improvement in fuel 
consumption. It is a method that is difficult to understand in 
their highly proud technology office, but Suzuki president Osamu 
Suzuki solemnly avers that, "It is no good to be too obsessed 
with technology development." 
  President Suzuki is the son-in-law adopted as an heir in the 
Suzuki family who are the founders. Since he was appointed 
president in 1978, he has taken the command in the very front 
line of management. He has a record of having increased sales 
that were about 250 billion yen when he was appointed to four 
times that at 1 trillion yen in a 16-year period, and his 
influence and the sense of confidence placed in him by employees 
is very great. The fact that he has been able to create a 
thorough Suzuki style of management strategy is probably because 
President Suzuki holds strong leadership within the company. 
  The cost reduction measure next set forth by Suzuki was the 
promotion of mergers of fellow affiliated parts manufacturers. 
At the beginning of the year, President Suzuki stated at a 
meeting of affiliated parts manufacturers that "I would like 
parts manufacturers with fewer than 100 employees to merge." The 
aim is to enlarge the scale of the parts manufacturers with whom 
they do business and cut part procurement costs. On 1 May, the 
first merger following this strategy just was born. If mergers 
increase in the future, the Suzuki stance will be strong and 
cost reductions will rapidly proceed. 
  However, there is an uneasy element in this management 
strategy. First of all, it is supply capability. The order 
balance for the Wagon R with favorable sales is over 20,000 
cars. With three hours of overtime a day at the Kosai plant, and 
implementation of over three days a month holiday work, monthly 
production has been increased to 10,000 cars, but an augment of 
facilities will be necessary to raise production capability 
further than this, and "makeshift contrivances" gradually are 
reaching a limit. 
  Actually, Suzuki announced in March that they would OEM 
supply the Wagon R to Mazda, but the specific period for the 
supply and number of cars is considered "undecided." The lack of 
surplus supply cannot be denied. 
  Considering the concept of the "Suzuki style" which holds 
costs to a minimum, it cannot help but be negative on new 
enlargement of plants. That is because it will be too much of a 
risk to bear if they fall into a sales slump after expanding 
facilities. 
  The reorganization of affiliated parts manufacturers also 
really is not easy. The persuasion of parts manufacturers who 
have a strong sense of being master of their own domain to the 
point of attaining a merger probably will be unsuccessful by 
ordinary methods. On the contrary, there also is a fear that it 
will invite opposition. 
  The problem of rebuilding Santana Motor, their Spanish 
subsidiary which is falling into a business slump, is also a 
cause of uneasiness. Suzuki announced in April that it reckons a 
bad debt loss of about 8.5 billion yen in the 1994 March 
settlement of accounts. It is quickly devising countermeasures, 
but it can lose its few production bases in Europe if it errs in 
handling it. 
  The appraisal of Suzuki has increased along with the steady 
rise in consumer orientation after the burst of the bubble. It 
will be its policy in the future also to proceed with a thorough 
reduction of costs with the strong leadership of President 
Suzuki. The fast clip of Suzuki is giving momentum to moves for 
parts sharing by the auto industry as a whole and supplying each 
others' vehicles. Those trends probably will be bathed in more 
and more attention in the future.

  [Text] Isuzu Motors is increasing production of diesel 
engines. The small engine "4J" for China and Thailand that is 
being produced at the Fujisawa plant (Fujisawa city) will be 
boosted in May from the current 20,000 units a month to 30,000 
units. The company is starting process production of the 
midsized engine "4H" at the Tochigi plant (Ohira Machi) 
beginning this spring. They are increasing engine production 
capability and preparing to expand overseas business and make 
full-scale the engine supply business to other companies at home. 
  The "4J" is a small engine with a displacement of 3100 cc 
that is carried in small trucks with a load capacity of 1.5 to 2 
tons. The increased production portion chiefly will be exported 
to the China joint venture, Jiangling 50 Ling Qiche Limited 
Corp. (Jiangxi Province) and the Thai joint-venture company, 
Isuzu Engine Manufacturing Company, Thailand (Bangkok). Truck 
sales have greatly increased in both countries and they are 
handling it by increasing engine exports from Japan. 
  The Tochigi plant previously had been in charge of machine 
processing of engine parts, but starting this spring, it will 
begin production of the medium engine "4H" with a 4300-cc to 
4800-cc displacement that is carried in the midsized to small 
truck "Elf." They are producing the engine with a monthly 
production of 5,000 units in order to begin supply of the engine 
to Mazda this summer. 
  Isuzu will begin OEM [original equipment manufacturer] 
supply 
of the Elf to Nissan Motor and Nissan Diesel Motor beginning in 
the summer of 1995. For this reason, prospects are that they 
will further increase production of the "4H" at the Tochigi 
plant in the future.

  [Text] Fuji Kiko, a Nissan Motor-affiliated medium-sized 
parts manufacturer, will open a new plant to produce truck 
steering wheel mechanisms in the United States at the end of 
this year. With the economic recovery in the United States, 
truck demand is rapidly increasing and since orders are too much 
to handle just with the existing U.S. plants, they will 
establish another plant exclusively for this mechanism. They 
will invest about 1 billion yen and begin production in 1995. 
After two years, the production of truck steering wheel 
mechanisms in the United States will increase to 3 billion yen, 
double that of today. 
  In order to raise production capability quickly, "We will 
purchase a new or used ready-built plant for the new plant" 
(President Michihiko Yamabe). The Michigan or southern U.S. 
areas are favored for the location, and matters are scheduled to 
be decided by summer. They will make use of leasing for 
introduction of equipment and start with 200 or 300 employees. 
  Fuji Kiko purchased the U.S. auto parts manufacturer Douglas 
Autotech (Michigan) in 1991, and has come to use the Douglas 
plant as the production base for steering wheel mechanisms in 
the United States. This new plant is also scheduled to be opened 
via its Douglas subsidiary. 
  The item produced is a steering wheel mechanism where the 
wheel height and angle can be changed manually. It is a product 
that has over a 50-percent share in the U.S. large truck market 
where carrying capacity exceeds 30 tons. Besides delivery to the 
major U.S. truck manufacturers, Navistar and John Deere, they 
also are studying supply to local Japanese manufacturers and 
export to Japan. 
  Along with the opening of the new plant, they will also 
increase production of steering wheel mechanisms for passenger 
cars that are being produced in the Douglas plant. They say that 
"We have also decided to supply U.S. Ford Motor recreational 
vehicles (RV), with whom we have not previously done business" 
(President Yamabe). Fuji Kiko sales for the March 1993 quarter 
were 56.4 billion yen, and business with the Nissan group such 
as Nissan Motor, Nissan Diesel, and Nissan Body exceeds 80 
percent. Since Nissan sales have been sluggish, however, they 
have been pressed to open up new markets.

  [Text] Nagoya--The Chubu Electric Power Company-affiliated 
Chubu Telecommunications Company (CTC--located in Nagoya City; 
president, Mitsuo Tanaka) and which plans to launch information 
communication services for the commercial sector, will begin 
construction of the "Nagoya Information Highway" during this 
fiscal year. About 20 of Nagoya City's principal convention 
centers such as the Nagoya City International Display Center and 
Fukiage Hall will be linked with optical fiber cable, enabling 
broadcasting firms, including urban cable television firms, to 
utilize two-way image transmission services. 
  CTC was established in 1988 and has already installed an 
optical fiber cable network in the Chubu region which extends 
for 6,000 kilometers. The highway concept will include the 
existing network to form one which circles the inner city. 
  The network will link the principal convention centers and 
the respective broadcasting firms will be able to transmit 
images by merely plugging cameras into the image-transmitting 
cable outlets. Installation costs will total 200 million yen and 
the project is scheduled for completion in two years. CTC 
expects annual usage to hit 1,000 transmissions and hopes to set 
rates at a lower point than that which is feasible with 
dedicated lines. 
  Dedicated circuits exist in both the Tokyo and Kansai areas 
to link convention centers, but CTS claims, "There are no other 
networks which cover such a wide area as the `Nagoya Information 
Highway.'" CTC says that if this concept works well, it will 
consider building a "long-distance information highway" which 
will operate on an intercity basis.

  [Text] Leading domestic communications equipment makers are 
all boosting production of cellular telephones. In response to 
increased demand being experienced as a result of the "outright 
sale system" which went into effect in April, NEC, Matsushita 
Communication Industrial, Fujitsu, and Japan Radio Company plan 
to double production of cellular telephones earmarked for 
domestic markets over levels of fiscal year 1993. Competition in 
the cellular telephone market is heating up because domestic 
appliance makers have joined the competition. In response, 
makers hope to gain a competitive edge by reducing costs through 
volume production. 
  NEC will increase its current fiscal year production of 
domestically marketed cellular telephones to 400,000-500,000 
units, more than twice the level of fiscal year 1993. NEC 
Saitama, its manufacturing subsidiary, is currently producing at 
the rate of about 1 million units a year for both domestic and 
overseas markets. About 200,000 units were distributed to 
domestic markets and the remainder was shipped to overseas 
markets, but domestic volume will be doubled because of the 
sharp jump in demand occasioned by decontrol leading to outright 
sales of cellulars. 
  Matsushita Communications Industrial boosted monthly 
production at its Shizuoka plant in Kakegawa city, Shizuoka 
Prefecture, to 50,000 units beginning in April. According to 
President Takashi Kawada, "Sales of digital cellulars are better 
than expected," and production plans were revised upward because 
of a sharp rise in demand, even though they had just increased 
production at the Shizuoka plant from the 30,000- to 40,000-unit 
level in March. 
  Fujitsu has invested roughly 1 billion yen in its Nasu plant 
in Otawara city, Tochigi Prefecture, to raise the capacity of 
that plant to 400,000 units from the current annual level of 
170,000. They also plan to increase employment commensurately. 
Further, Japan Radio Company lifted production capacity at its 
Saitama plant located in Kamifukuoka city, Saitama Prefecture, 
twofold to a monthly rate of 20,000 units.

  [Text] Jakarta, Indonesia, 7 May -- A corporate consortium, 
composed of Sumitomo Corporation, NEC, and the major Indonesian 
firm Funpus [as transliterated], received an order for a 
444,100-circuit digital switching system from the Indonesian 
National Telecommunications Company (TELCOM). The value of the 
order was about 10 billion yen. For the Sumitomo consortium, 
this will be the second order of this nature following a 
350,000-circuit system contract signed in 1991. Indonesia is 
endeavoring to attain an early resolution to the shortage of 
communication circuits and Sumitomo hopes to receive additional 
orders. 
  The equipment will be delivered by NEC and installation will 
begin in July of this year by NEC Nusantara Communications, a 
joint venture formed by NEC, Sumitomo and a local Indonesian 
corporate organization called Pimantara Group. The equipment 
will be installed over a two-year period on Java and Kalimantan 
islands. 
  Indonesia has about 3 million telephone circuits, providing 
for less than two telephones per 100 population. The government 
considers the construction of a more adequate communication 
network as being essential to encouraging foreign investment in 
the country and plans on installing 5 million new circuits in 
the five-year period following fiscal year 1994. Until the 
1980's, Siemens of Germany had a monopoly on the Indonesian 
telephone switching market, but has since been joined by AT&amp;T 
and NEC, providing for representation by three makers.

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) 
has begun to provide assistance to private firms in winning bids 
for information infrastructure construction projects in Asia. 
The government has established a "Liaison Council for 
Coordinating Construction of Information Infrastructure Relative 
to Asian Regional Development," chaired by MPT International 
Department director Yoshio Uchimi and comprised of 11 companies 
such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and NEC and three 
academics. The council will participate in the joint preparation 
of development plans with target nations and promote 
participation in various projects. The initially targeted area 
will be China and the Shanghai region and on-site surveys will 
start in the first part of June. It aims at recovering ground 
lost in the area of infrastructure construction to European and 
U.S. firms because of a late start. 
  The liaison council will also see the participation of 
Fujitsu, Taisei Construction, Mitsui and Company, and the Sakura 
Research Center. Other members will include three academics such 
as Hitotsubashi University professor Takayuki Itami and 
government-affiliated agencies such as the Japan Export-Import 
Bank. If the projects go smoothly and other organizations desire 
to join the council, additional memberships will be approved. 
  In practice, a joint research forum will be established with 
the target nation under the auspices of the MPT for the purpose 
of conducting integrated studies on the need for communication 
services, status of policies and actual construction work and 
overall regional effect of projects. Upon completion of such 
studies, the Japanese representatives will propose a 
communication infrastructure construction project which 
encompasses factors such as installation of public telephones, 
cellular communications and satellite communications which are 
compatible with local conditions. In so doing, MPT intends to 
implement government aid as well as to assist in the winning of 
bids for pending projects. 
  The reason why China was selected as the first target area 
was that when Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Koizumi 
visited China in May 1993, Japan was formally requested to 
extend aid under a plan which visualized the installation of 100 
million telephones by the year 2000, or twice current levels, 
and which brightened the prospects for major construction 
projects. In the future, the MPT hopes to expand candidate areas 
beyond China to include Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and 
Thailand. 
  Participation of Japanese firms in the construction of 
communications infrastructure in the Asian region had lagged in 
the past. A look at the supplier records of digital switching 
equipment destined for China shows that NEC and Fujitsu rank 
third and fifth respectively and that the combined share of the 
two firms is 20 percent. While European firms hold the first and 
second ranking positions, U.S. firms which had lagged just like 
Japanese firms are now beginning to win major projects. 
  The recent MPT projects to extend assistance to the private 
sector could very well invite criticism from Europe and the 
United States that, "Such efforts could distort private-sector 
competition."

  [Text] Rapid progress is being made on feasibility studies 
envisioning the commercialization of personal handiphone systems 
(PHS) touted as low-priced next-generation portable telephones. 
Applications for licenses will be accepted for processing before 
yearend and, if all goes well, PHS services will begin in fiscal 
year 1995. They estimate that PHS unit installations will reach 
10 million units in the 21st century, but the question is, will 
the industry develop as anticipated by communications operators, 
manufacturers, and government officials? The second installment 
of this article will examine the issues which must be overcome 
in the commercialization of PHS by analyzing the advantages and 
disadvantages of PHS. 
  The Communication Equipment Industry Council-sponsored 
"Communication Tokyo 94" opened on 5 April at the International 
Exhibition Center at Harumi, Tokyo. The event was attended by 
about 120,000 visitors during the four-day event ending on 8 
April, but elaborately designed manufacturer display booths were 
disregarded as crowds thronged to see demonstrations of PHS. 
  A total of 23 PHS units supplied by 20 different firms was 
made available by the Feasibility Study Council, the sponsoring 
agency, but interested parties swarmed the loan booth and there 
was a 30-minute wait throughout the event in order to get to a 
PHS unit for personal testing, and units on display could be 
reached only by navigating one's way through the crowds. During 
the event, PHS units were loaned out a total of 2,702 times, 
meaning that each unit was checked out an average of 120 times. 
Council sources say, "Conspicuous among the interested parties 
were individuals who are not communication specialists." "PHS 
fever" is expanding in breadth. 
  All the enthusiasm currently displayed in PHS is being 
stimulated by news on feasibility studies underway in Tokyo. 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone [NTT[ and Dainidenden Inc. (DDI), 
which initially ran experiments in Sapporo, started tests in 
Tokyo in April and the Tokyo Electric Power Company group 
started tests in Tokyo about the same time. 
  However, it appears that individuals visiting the displays 
and using the PHS units on loan did not grasp their difference 
from cellular units. Although they say the quality of voice 
communication is better with the PHS, the basic telephone 
functions are the same. The units are supposed to be smaller and 
lighter than cellulars, but the advent of the outright sales 
system in April was accompanied by the release of smaller and 
lighter versions of cellulars, and differences between the two 
types of telephones are hardly noticeable and difficult to 
distinguish. 
  The foremost attraction of PHS is that user rates can be set 
at a much lower level than that for cellulars. Industry sources 
estimate the basic charge will be set at around 3,000-5,000 yen 
compared to 7,000-9,000 yen for cellulars, and call charges will 
be 20-30 yen per minute compared to 60-70 yen per minute for 
cellulars. You might say that the foremost distinguishing factor 
for PHS is that both basic charges and call rates are expected 
to be 33 percent to 50 percent cheaper than for cellulars. 
  The low costs are attributable to the estimated cost for 
installation of communication infrastructure for PHS, which, for 
the 23 wards in Tokyo, is estimated to be one-sixth of that for 
cellular systems on a per subscriber basis. The cost for 
installing an operating station runs about three times that for 
cellular for the same service areas, but a 20-fold increase in 
subscriber capacity provides for a structure wherein an increase 
in subscribers allows lower service rates. 
  Because of the high rates, cellulars are used primarily for 
commercial purposes, but PHS provides conditions which make it 
conducive for household use. Feasibility studies are underway in 
Takamatsu city which have focused on that particular quality. 
  Principles involved in the feasibility study include six 
electrical power company-affiliated communications firms such as 
the Shikoku Telecommunication Network (STNet). Takamatsu city 
has a population of about 400,000 and the feasibility study 
covers an area of about five square kilometers including 
commercial, retail and residential areas, thus enabling an 
examination of use by household units. Tests in the Tokyo and 
Sapporo areas did not include residential zones. 
  President Hajime Mizuguchi of STNet displays much enthusiasm 
as he says, "The telephone business is indispensable in 
expanding the operational scope of our firm. We hope to deal in 
PHS systems on an independent basis to reduce the time it takes 
for the exchange of information with Tokyo." The STNet test will 
involve 132 stations, 500 PHS units, and 1 billion yen in 
feasibility study costs. 
  An advantage for electrical power company-affiliated 
communications firms is that they can use optical fiber networks 
installed jointly with the electrical power companies. PHS 
requires a digital network for location marking, but services 
can be provided without using public digital networks, because 
of the availability of an independent network. 
  Of the nine electrical power company-affiliated 
communications firms, only the Tokyo Telecommunications Network 
(TTNet) provides telephone services, but the systems is such 
that a call cannot be made from the NTT side to the TTNet side. 
  In contrast, PHS is a two-way system and has the potential 
of 
growing into a system separate from that of the NTT system. 
Electric power company-affiliated communication firms show an 
interest in PHS for this very reason. 
  Needless to say, a boost in the variety of services provided 
would translate into an increase in service fee revenues for 
NTT. Even in the case of DDI, which plans to use NTT circuits, 
President Takamura Okuyama states there is the advantage of 
"providing integrated telephone services based on wireless 
communication." Common among the interested firms is the strong 
determination to realize corporate growth through the creation 
of new demand. 
  All of the primary communications firms are participating in 
feasibility studies because unlimited potential rests with PHS 
systems which are expected to represent a huge market. The 
battle to realize those dreams still lies ahead.

  [Text] "Dainidenden (DDI) has an excellent eye for 
businesses with good potential." Eight groups, composed 
primarily of communications firms, have announced feasibility 
studies on personal handiphone systems (PHS), and special 
attention is being focused on the activities of DDI. DDI and 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) together launched tests in 
Sapporo half a year ahead of the other groups. The reason for 
DDI's early start was progress on its proprietary technology. 
  DDI's pioneering attributes are clearly visible in the 
development of its land stations which communicate with PHS 
units and the progress made in the development of data bases for 
managing customer information. Further development will require 
an interface to link with the NTT network, but NTT has announced 
a model of that interface via the Telecommunication and 
Telephone Technology Committee. 
  NTT Service Development Department's Personal Service 
Development Project Committee chief Tadao Kobayashi says, "The 
status of current feasibility studies reveals whether or not 
interested parties were initially serious about development of 
PHS systems," in providing an indirect evaluation of DDI's 
posture on PHS. 
  The land stations used by the eight groups can be broadly 
categorized into two types. Aside from DDI, they all use land 
stations which emit signals with an output of 20 milliwatts. 
Since PHS uses a standard communication interface, there is 
little incentive to develop proprietary facilities, unlike 
cellulars that use two different formats. 
  However, DDI uses a format with a transmitter output of 500 
milliwatts or 25 times greater. According to managing director 
Yoshio Senmoto, "DDI faces fewer restrictions in terms of 
locating land stations as long as it can reduce the numbers," as 
a result of being able to cover more space by using high output 
stations, whereas NTT-format land stations can handle only calls 
which are within a radius of 100 meters. The DDI format also 
reduces the frequency of "handovers," interruptions in 
communications that are experienced when a PHS user moves from 
one land station area to the next land station area. 
  Industry sources estimate that use of 20-milliwatt land 
stations in the 23 wards of Tokyo would require the installation 
of more than 20,000 land stations, but NTT could use public 
telephone boxes and electric power company-affiliated firms 
could use electrical utility poles. DDI opted for high-output 
land stations as a last resort to overcome the issue of 
locations for land stations. However, regardless of the high 
output feasible for land stations, the output from PHS units 
will be limited to 10 milliwatts. If the land stations were not 
capable of receiving the weak signals from the PHS units, then 
there would be a problem. DDI has overcome that potential 
problem by improving reception at the land stations by 
converting to civilian use technology held by a military 
equipment maker in Israel. Managing director and chief of the 
Management Planning Department Sanshiro Fukada states, "Both the 
specific name of the company and the nature of the technology is 
secret," but DDI has made use of technology of foreign 
manufacturers who have been thorough in their efforts at PHS 
development. 
  DDI opted for that course of action because its assessment 
was that primary communications makers were organized into a 
consortium called the "NTT family" and that it would be 
difficult to surpass rival NTT in the area of technology through 
the use of domestic equipment. In its efforts to develop a 
compression technology system for digital signals with a U.S. 
venture firm, DDI used 20 firms worldwide such as in Europe, the 
United States, and Israel in the area of research and 
development and parts procurement. Managing director Senmoto 
states DDI's objective was to "make itself a model for 
development" amidst the prevailing air of international trade 
friction. 
  Investment costs thus far have totaled 10 billion yen. 
However, circuits to be used are not proprietary. Rival NTT's 
integrated services digital network (ISDN) circuits will be used 
to link land stations. 
  Of the eight groups engaged in feasibility studies, three 
groups such as those affiliated with electrical power companies 
will use proprietary network circuits. Proprietary networks will 
entail infrastructure costs, but will eliminate access charges 
associated with the use of NTT ISDN circuits. PHS which is 
dependent on low user rates could face an issue of survival or 
death if it involved the payment of access charges. 
  Department chief Kobayashi of NTT suggests, "In principle, 
access charges are based on actual cost, but if they are too 
high, they could lead to the failure of both user and service 
provider," but if DDI were to be forced to use NTT ISDN 
circuits, it may not be able to use its proprietary technologies. 
  Unlike long-distance telephone and cellulars which have been 
provided by all of the NCC (new common carrier) companies, PHS 
is a service that can be provided by all communication companies 
with a uniform service initiation time frame. DDI which offers 
Motorola cellular services has also rejected the NTT format for 
PHS service. However, on cellulars it went with technology 
borrowed from Motorola, but on PHS they are challenging the 
competition with proprietary technology. 
  According to managing director Fukada, it is because of this 
reason that the company feels a strong sense of crisis that "It 
will lose to the competition if it lags in technology." DDI 
launched itself into the PHS effort under the leadership of 
Messrs Senmoto and Fukada, formerly of NTT, despite assertions 
of caution within the company. DDI just may become the center of 
a highly turbulent situation while establishing technological 
distinctions which separate it from the competition.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vietnam/Italy: Confindustria </F>
Delegation Ends Visit"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Ho Chi Minh City, May 14 -- A four-day visit 
to Vietnam by a delegation from Italy's Confindustria [General 
Confederation of Italian Industry] private employers' 
association wound up Saturday [14 May], with Confindustria 
sources confident over investment opportunities for the future. 
  The delegation, led by Rosolino Orlando, included eight 
representatives from the Italian Banking Association (ABI). It 
met with the chamber of commerce and with top officials from the 
foreign, industry and agriculture ministries, as well as talking 
with World Bank and International Monetary Fund staff here. 
  Great developments in Vietnam are being hampered, the 
Italians found, by lack of capital and some raw materials, and 
infrastructure, including electricity and transport. 
  The Vietnamese authorities managed, however, to keep 
inflation down to seven percent in 1993, and the local currency, 
the dong, has remained remarkably stable with an influx of 
dollars after the lifting of the United States embargo against 
formerly-Communist Vietnam. 
  Vietnamese industry is keen to enter joint ventures with 
partners who would benefit from very favourable conditions, the 
Italian delegation learnt, and the government is well on the way 
to resolving some financial problems which have beset foreign 
investment to date. 
  Making Vietnam a particularly attractive proposition for 
Italian industry are a willing workforce and flexibility as 
regards new productive activities, said delegation sources who 
pointed out that Italian firms are already involved in strategic 
sectors such as energy, diesel engines, farm machinery, 
telecommunications, leatherwork and textiles in Vietnam. 
  Italy doubled its exports to Vietnam in 1993, when they 
reached 98 billion lire (61.2 million dollars), while Vietnam's 
exports to Italy rose threefold to 45 billion lire (28.1 million 
dollars).

  [Text] Singapore's economic growth this year is expected 
to be at the higher end of the 6 to 8 percent forecast by the 
government last November. The Ministry of Trade and Industry 
said the continued expansion in the U.S. economy and the strong 
growth in developing countries will have a favorable effect on 
Singapore's trade. The ministry made its optimistic forecast in 
its latest quarterly economic survey. The survey showed that 
the economy expanded by a higher than expected 11 percent in the 
first quarter of this year, exceeding earlier forecasts of 
between 9 and 10 percent. It forecast the 10.7 percent growth 
in the first quarter of last year and the 9.9 percent recorded 
for the whole of 1993. 
  Growth was mainly fueled by the exceptionally strong 
performance in the manufacturing sector and the financial and 
business and services sectors. Manufacturing output expanded 
11.9 percent in the first quarter over the same period in 1993, 
boosted by a strong external demand. The electronic, machinery, 
and transport equipment industries also experienced strong 
growth. The financial and business sector expanded by 14 
percent, while the construction sector by a strong 10.8 percent. 
The commerce sector expanded by 9.1 percent, and the transport 
and communication sector grew just under 10 percent. 
  Total volume of trade continued to expand in the first 
quarter, growing by 14 percent. Exports grew by 12 percent, 
while imports increased by 9.6 percent. Non-oil domestic 
exports rose by 13 percent, nearly doubling the growth in the 
first quarter of last year. 
  The number of jobs created in the first quarter, however, 
was 
lower than that in the previous quarter. Labor productivity 
grew some 6 percent, unchanged from the previous sector. 
  Inflation rose 3.2 percent compared to the same quarter last 
year.

  [Text] The Japanese and the U.S. Governments have agreed to 
expand the "common agenda for cooperation in global perspective" 
-- one of the pillars of the Japan-U.S. trade framework. The 
two governments will hold a vice ministerial meeting on the 
matter in Washington on 24 May. In the meeting, the two nations 
will decide to incorporate in the agenda four additional areas 
of cooperation, including drug eradication and the establishment 
of a network to promote exchanges between institutes engaging in 
environmental protection studies. Although Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks were suspended in such sectors as autos and 
macroeconomics following summit talks in February, the two 
governments have continued to discuss the issue of bilateral 
cooperation in the area of global issues. The Japanese 
Government hopes to seek ways to resume deadlocked trade talks 
in the sectoral and macroeconomics areas by confirming 
cooperative ties between Japan and the United States at the 
forthcoming meeting in the area of global issues. 
  The framework talks consist of three main sections: 
macroeconomics (such as continuation of tax cuts), bilateral 
cooperation in solving global issues, and sectoral areas (such 
as government procurement, autos, and insurance). Although the 
recent summit talks failed to result in an agreement on 
macroeconomics and sectoral areas, the two governments have 
since kept contacts with each other through diplomatic channels. 
The two governments have decided to hold a third round of vice 
ministerial talks as scheduled because there are no points of 
conflict in the area of bilateral cooperation in solving global 
issues. The third round of talks will be attended by Deputy 
Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Hayashi and Deputy Vice 
Minister for Industrial and Trade Affairs Okamatsu from the 
Japanese Government, and Under Secretary of State Wirth as U.S. 
delegate. 
  As for drug eradication measures, the vice ministers are 
scheduled to discuss the need to promote information exchange 
between Japan and the United States and how to help the Peruvian 
Government's efforts to transform opium-growing areas into more 
normal agricultural areas. Concerning establishment of a 
network between environment protection institutes, the two 
nations will proceed with a plan to set up a system of 
information exchange between European nations, the United 
States, and the Asia-Pacific region as a measure to help prevent 
global warming. In addition, a "children and health" program 
designed to supply vaccines for developing countries and a 
"coral reef protection measure" will also be discussed as 
additional areas of cooperation. 
  At the summit talks in February, the two governments agreed 
to cooperate in dealing with 15 global issues -- such as 
environmental protection, population, AIDS, the ocean, and 
transportation technology. Officials concerned with those 
issues from both governments will also attend the forthcoming 
meeting, and in the meeting the two nations will follow up the 
February agreement. 
  As for economic framework talks in macroeconomics and 
sectoral areas, it is expected that unofficial vice ministerial 
negotiations will begin this week in hopes of finding ways to 
resume the talks. At the unofficial negotiations, the two 
nations are expected to exchange and coordinate views on how to 
define "objective criteria," which is a main cause of the 
failure of the summit talks in February.

  [Text] It was learned on 13 May that the Japanese 
Government had presented a new plan to Washington to promote the 
standardization of both countries' patent systems, which is an 
important topic in the Japan-U.S. trade framework talks. The 
plan proposes that: 1) The United States introduce an open 
information system under which information on inventions is 
disclosed after patents are applied for; and 2) Japan abolish 
the system of allowing a third person to make objections to a 
patent applied for in a period of patent examination. The 
disclosure of information on inventions will reduce the number 
of patent disputes between Japan and the United States, while 
the abolition of the objection system will shorten the period 
needed for patent examination. Tokyo hopes this mutual 
compromise will lead to the resumption of the stalled framework 
trade talks. 
  The plan was recently submitted in writing by Patent Office 
Director General Aso to U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Chief 
Lehman. In both Japan and Europe, information on inventions is 
disclosed after patents are applied for. In the United States, 
however, information is not disclosed during patent examination. 
Under the U.S. system, it is possible that when patent 
examination is seriously delayed, a patent is issued 10 or more 
years after submission of the application. Such patents are 
called "submarine patents." 
  When a submarine patent is given to technology after many 
years, companies that have used the technology for a long time 
are sometimes asked to pay huge patent royalties. This happened 
in the past and caused international disputes over patents. For 
example, an image-processing technique for automobile production 
invented by an American was patented in 1992, although the 
application for the patent was submitted in 1954. In a dispute 
over the royalty of this submarine patent, Japanese automakers 
had to pay 200-300 million yen to 2-3 billion yen each to settle 
the dispute. The Japanese Government thinks if Washington 
accepts its compromise plan, patent disputes of this kind can be 
averted. 
  Under the objection system, the government receives the 
objection, which should be made within three months after a 
patent is applied for, from a third person who claims "a patent 
should not be given to the invention" and the claim is used for 
reference during patent examination. The abolition of this 
system will simplify procedures for patent licensing and make a 
prompt examination possible. However, to protect the rights of a 
third person, the government plans to establish a new system 
under which objection is accepted after a patent is issued and 
if necessary, the patent is reexamined. 
  There are growing voices within U.S. industries calling for 
introduction of an open information system. They say: "The 
system will help increase the transparency of patent examination 
and avert unnecessary disputes over patents." Moreover, a bill 
to introduce an open information system has been submitted to 
the U.S. Senate. These things led Tokyo to the conclusion that 
popular opinion in the United States is greatly tilting toward 
introducing an open information system. Based on this 
conclusion and as a compromise, Tokyo has included in the new 
plan a proposal to abolish its objection system, which has long 
been criticized by Washington as being the cause of prolonged 
patent examination in Japan. If the United States introduces an 
open information system under which information on inventions is 
disclosed after patents are applied for, there will be no 
problems with submarine patents, and Japan and the United States 
will begin to move toward standardization of their patent 
systems.

  [Text] On 14 May, a Foreign Ministry source disclosed that 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] has made firm its plan to 
actively conduct "preventive diplomacy" to prevent in advance 
the outbreak of international conflicts or the expansion of such 
conflicts. The plan is in line with UN policy which stipulates 
that "preventive diplomacy" would be the international 
organization's new role in dealing with post-Cold War regional 
conflicts. 
  Specifically, MOFA plans to promote a policy through which 
it 
hopes to prevent expansion of ethnic conflicts in the Balkan 
region by helping to bring about political stability in 
countries in the region. In order to do this, MOFA plans to 
actively provide aid to such countries as Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM], which has declared 
independence from the former Yugoslavia, and its neighbor, 
Albania, both of which lie near the areas of conflict in that 
region. Moreover, as MOFA places heavy emphasis on the roles of 
nongovernmental organizations (NGO), which have set up regional 
networks, it now plans to set up a "civilian support office" 
within the ministry. The office will have general supervision 
over NGO's which are engaged in activities overseas. 
  As for "preventive diplomacy," the idea was taken up in a 
report which UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali made to the 
United Nations in 1992, entitled "Agenda for Peace." The idea 
has since been clearly incorporated in UN activities. At last 
year's General Assembly session, the United Nations adopted a 
resolution which approved conducting peacekeeping operations 
(PKO) for preventive purposes. It has become increasingly 
acknowledged that "it is becoming a global trend to recognize 
the importance of preventive diplomacy through which conflicts 
can be prevented beforehand by detecting indications of such 
conflicts well in advance, or through which on-going conflicts 
can be kept from spreading or developing into full-scale war" 
(as stated by a MOFA source). 
  Moreover, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, upon his 
inauguration, said he plans to consider "preventive diplomacy" 
as part of "active diplomacy" which Japan will now pursue. 
  According to MOFA, approximately 100 million yen was 
extended 
as subsidies to NGO's in fiscal year 1989. Since then, the 
government's subsidies have increased very sharply. For 
example, 440 million yen was allocated in fiscal year 1993, and 
540 million yen has been allocated in the fiscal year 1994 draft 
budget. 
  In addition, NGO's, for their part, have begun to be 
actively 
involved in preventive diplomacy. For example, an NGO called 
the "International Dispute Prevention Research Organization" is 
scheduled to be established on 19 May with the assistance of the 
UN University. This organization will focus its activities on 
preventive diplomacy.

  [Text] About 60 trading firms and foreign-affiliated 
companies engaged in computer-related business will establish an 
association as early as this month to expand public procurement 
of foreign-made computers and information equipment. The 
association will call on ministries and agencies in charge to 
review the ordering system and bidding procedures so as to 
facilitate foreign-affiliated makers' participation in public 
works projects in the telecommunications sector. It will also 
collect information on public works projects and provide it to 
its members. The U.S. Government and other organs have made 
more active moves to seek expansion of the government 
procurement of supercomputers as well as the importation of 
foreign-made information equipment, including cellular phones. 
Under such circumstances, the association aims to become a 
"lobbying body" to promote business with Japan. 
  The new organization expected to be established will be 
(tentatively) named the "Association for the Promotion of 
Telecommunications Equipment Import." The members are expected 
to include foreign-affiliated computer makers and software 
development companies, system houses, and trading firms engaged 
in the importation of information equipment. Among major 
companies that will be invited to participate are: Electronic 
Data Systems (EDS), the Rikei Company [name as published], IBM 
Japan, Microsoft Company, Motorola Company, Nihon Unisys Ltd., 
Nihon Digital Equipment Company, and Sumitomo Co. The 
preparatory committee (with Takefumi Kanoya serving as chief of 
the secretariat) has been proceeding with the selection of 
executives and the association is expected to be formed as early 
as May. 
  Several special committees such as the "Council for 
Reforming 
Public Works Project Ordering System" will be formed under this 
association. Through these committees, the association plans to 
collect information on government-planned projects and make 
recommendations on how to promote telecommunications by setting 
up a desirable public system and on how to revise the ordering 
system.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuichi Ichikawa, general secretary of </F>
Komeito, by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What are your plans for dealing 
with the Diet? 
  [Ichikawa] There are now so many issues to be dealt with by 
Japan, such as expanding domestic demand, market liberalization, 
and the suspected DPRK (North Korea) nuclear arms program. 
These problems are difficult to deal with regardless of who is 
in the cabinet. We are a minority in the Diet, but I think we 
should find a way through--by making efforts to turn the cabinet 
into one which is supported by the public. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] There is some talk about the possibility of 
the House of Representatives being dissolved soon. 
  [Ichikawa] I expect many issues to be raised in the course 
of the Diet deliberations on the budget bill, but I do not think 
that will trigger dissolution of the house. Dissolution of the 
house or the resignation en masse of the cabinet can be 
considered only when the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] presents 
a motion of no confidence in the cabinet, and the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] supports it. But if that 
happens, I would like to ask this question--what is the 
justification for it? If the SDPJ decides to cooperate in the 
motion, that will only mean the political regime of 1955 will be 
revived. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think about the possibility of 
the next general election being conducted under the current 
medium electoral district system? 
  [Ichikawa] The next general election should be held under 
the new single-seat district system combined with the 
proportional representation system. After all, the political 
reform bills were passed with the approval of both the LDP and 
the SDPJ. SDPJ Chairman Murayama recently said, "the general 
election should be held under the current system after an 
agreement is made on the zoning of the single-seat districts." 
What he said can be interpreted as meaning he wants to crush 
political reform and revert to the original state. If that 
happens, it will constitute an act of blackmailing the people. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] When do you want the bill on zoning of the 
single-seat districts to be enacted? 
  [Ichikawa] We will try to get it passed at the current 
session of the Diet. We must not ignore the intentions of the 
review council, but we should hasten to get ready so that the 
lower house can be dissolved for an election under the new 
system. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Now that the SDPJ has left the coalition, 
will the concept for "another new party" envisaged by Komeito 
undergo a change? 
  [Ichikawa] If it is assumed that the next general election 
will be held under the new election system, another new party is 
a necessity. There is no change in my belief that two political 
forces should compete for government power. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] The bases for political world reorganization 
are becoming fragile. 
  [Ichikawa] Under the existing tripolar structure, it will be 
a minority government regardless of which party assumes power. 
If the LDP and the SDPJ agree on a coalition, it would be 
tantamount to the two parties committing suicide. The key is 
how the public will judge and decide to act if it turns out that 
a ruling party cannot perform its tasks because it is a minority 
in power. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you have a "next move" aimed at changing 
the situation? 
  [Ichikawa] I do not have any particular plan. We do not 
need to raise issues from our side. When a major problem does 
arise, people concerned about the problem will speak up. We 
must face problems squarely and not play tricks. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] You severely criticized remarks by former 
Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano about the Nanjing massacre. 
  [Ichikawa] If you consider the war not simply as a 
Japan-U.S. 
war, but as a 15-year war that started with the Manchurian 
conflict in 1931, the nature of aggression of the war becomes 
clear. There is no question that Japan invaded Asian countries 
to reign over them. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] That view differs from the view on history 
of some of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] members. 
  [Icikawa] There may be differences. If Japan wants to live 
in the international community, however, the country cannot gain 
the understanding of the Asian countries unless it does some 
soul-searching and recognizes the past war as a war of 
aggression. I feel so strongly about that I believe it cannot 
be helped even if our party's relationship with Shinseito is 
jeopardized over differences of this historic view in the future. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What are the prospects for holding talks on 
the tax system reform question? 
  [Ichikawa] We will need to come up with a conclusion on 
consistent policy direction. A tax system reform has become a 
sort of international commitment. The way for the cabinet to 
survive is to come up with that conclusion.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 16 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Foreign 
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Monday, reiterated Malaysia's 
stand that the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) should 
be a party to any peace initiatives on Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Our stand is firm and consistent with the wishes of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina itself, he told reporters at the international 
airport in Subang, near here, on his return from the 
Malaysia-Mauritius joint commission meeting. 
  He was commenting on a report that several European 
countries 
had excluded the OIC in their efforts to end the conflict in 
Bosnia, where Muslims are facing ethnic cleansing by the Serbs. 
  Abdullah said Bosnia-Herzegovina had emphasised at a recent 
UN Security Council meeting that it would only accept any peace 
process which involved the OIC. 
  On the OIC contact group's decision that the OIC was 
prepared 
to fill the void created by any withdrawal of UN peacekeepers in 
Bosnia, he said Malaysia's stand was clear in that it would 
continue to help the country defend its sovereignty and 
independence. 
  We definitely support the group's decision. Any OIC efforts 
that are beneficial to Bosnia-Herzegovina will have our support, 
he said. 
  He said Malaysia welcomed the U.S. Senate committee's 
decision asking for a lifting of the arms embargo on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We sincerely hope that the lifting of the embargo will be 
done in the true sense of the word without any condition, he 
said.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Thurs. -- After five years in 
Malaysia, about 100 Vietnamese refugees, who were not accepted 
by any third country, left for Ho Chi Minh City today under the 
voluntary repatriation program. 
  So far, 3,054 Vietnamese illegal immigrants had voluntarily 
returned home since the programme began three years ago, leaving 
6,820 boat people at the Sungei Besi camp. 
  The returnees expressed enthusiasm about heading home as 
many 
felt the Vietnamese economy was brighter. Pham Phu Cong, 30, 
wants to return to his tailoring work. "My wife and I are happy 
to return as we are both in the tailoring line and want to start 
building a future for ourselves," said this father of one.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Political powerbroker Ichiro 
Ozawa called on the ruling coalition on Monday [16 May] to have 
confidence in its mission while rejecting proposals to permit 
the return of the maverick Social Democratic Party to the fold. 
  In a speech in Chiba, the Shinseito secretary general 
rejected any plans to do away with the intraparliamentary group 
"Kaishin (Innovation)" if it would entice the return of the 
second largest opposition party, which bolted from the coalition 
last month. 
  "The ruling party must have this kind of confidence. We must 
be able to have confidence in our ideals and answer the 
expectations of the people," said Ozawa, the acknowledged 
architect of the ruling minority coalition. 
  Earlier Monday, Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the 
Democratic Socialist Party, and Japan New Party executive Masao 
Matsuoka suggested the ruling coalition would be willing to 
withdraw plans for "Kaishin" if it would entice the return of 
the SDP. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will formally inform SDP 
Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayama on Tuesday of the suggestion and urge the SDP 
to rejoin the coalition. 
  The SDP, however, has charged that there is still an 
"authoritarian character" to the current coalition and denied 
that there was any possibility of a return of the SDP to the 
ruling force. 
  The SDP withdrew from the ruling coalition only hours after 
it had helped elect Tsutomu Hata premier, upset by maneuvers by 
other coalition parties to form the new political alignment 
without the party. 
  Ozawa warned that in the event of general elections, the 
largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party would win by a 
landslide and that the "only other survivor would be Shinseito." 
  "We must not think only of the advantages before us and turn 
left or turn right. The socialists and Komeito were with us 
when we decided to proceed and we must think about achieving an 
historically great achievement," urged Ozawa. 
  Ozawa dismissed suggestions by murayama and new party 
Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura that the House of 
Representatives be dissolved for elections under the current 
electoral system. 
  "That is only the talk of people who do not have the right 
to 
decide on the dissolution. The cabinet will make that 
decision," said Ozawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Tuesday urged his select cabinet ministers to take the 
initiative in coming up with tough deregulation measures by the 
end of June, Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. 
  Hata, in seeking their cooperation at a top-level meeting, 
called the task of carving out effective measures for 
deregulation the mission of his cabinet, the top government 
spokesman told reporters. 
  The gathering comes at a time when the government is 
struggling to flesh out a package of market-opening measures 
unveiled in March in a bid to break the impasse in stalled trade 
talks with the United States by June, he said. 
  The relaxation of economically restrictive government 
regulations forms the core of the fresh substantial 
market-opening package aimed at stimulating the sluggish 
Japanese economy and its appetite for imports. 
  Tuesday's meeting followed a similar session held Friday 
where Hata and five key cabinet ministers agreed on the need to 
come up with powerful deregulatory steps by the end of June. 
  "We have only 50 more days," Kumagai said, in reference to 
the deadline for the formulation of the additional mart-opening 
package. "The pace of our efforts will be quickened 
significantly." 
  On top of key cabinet ministers, the meeting brought 
together 
heads of ministers and agencies holding control over a number of 
regulations. 
  Among participants were Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Koshiro Ishida, Chief of the 
Management and Coordination Agency and Yoshio Terasawa, head of 
the Economic Planning Agency. 
  Other participants included the heads of the health and 
welfare, farm, transport, posts, construction and home affairs 
ministries as well as the chief of the National Land Agency.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- The leader of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) on Tuesday [17 May] told Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata the main opposition force will demand the prime 
minister's resignation after the fiscal 1994 national budget 
clears the Diet, a senior LDP official said. 
  "When the budget is acted upon, we will again call on you to 
shape up," LDP President Yohei Kono said in a meeting with Hata 
in an indication that the LDP will submit a no-confidence motion 
against the Hata cabinet. 
  Kono also noted the Hata administration is "a government 
under abnormal circumstances" and urged Hata to be aware that 
his government is a minority one, Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary 
general, told a news conference. 
  The remarks apparently reflect the LDP chief's belief that 
the Hata cabinet will have completed its duties when it passes 
the key budget through the Diet. 
  Kono, responding to the prime minister's call for the LDP's 
cooperation in Diet debate on the long-overdue budget, revealed 
his party is ready to cooperate in an active manner if the 
government admits its responsibility for the delay in budget 
discussions. 
  Hata also called on the LDP to extend a helping hand to the 
coalition government on political reform and tax system reform, 
Naoto Kitamura, deputy chief cabinet secretary, told a separate 
news conference. 
  The prime minister, who leads the first minority government 
in 39 years, spoke pointedly of the need to enact a bill that 
demarcates a new constituency map for House of Representatives 
elections, according to Kitamura. 
  The encounter between Hata and Kono is the first since Hata 
took to the helm of the government on April 28. Hata was 
accompanied by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai and 
Kitamura, while Kono attended along with Mori and LDP Diet 
Affairs Committee Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato. 
  During the one-hour meeting held in the Diet building, Hata 
also reiterated there is no backpedalling in his government's 
policy of charting a course for sweeping tax system reform by 
the end of June so as to enact necessary legislation by the 
year's end. 
  While the premier expressed his determination to carry out 
drastic deregulation, the LDP leader showed willingness to 
cooperate in reviewing economic regulations, Kitamura said. 
  On former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's alleged 
involvement in improper financial dealings, Kono pressed a 
demand the government agree to summon Hosokawa to the Diet as a 
sworn witness, Mori said. 
  Hata's meeting with Kono was the first in a series of 
meetings with leaders of political parties outside the ruling 
coalition. 
  The premier also was to meet later Tuesday with Social 
Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, New Party Sakigake 
Leader Masayoshi Takemura, and Michihiko Kano, head of the new 
party Mirai.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) will submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet of 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata after passage of the fiscal 1994 
budget through the Diet, a senior party official said Tuesday. 
  "Mr. Hata's role will be over once he passes the budget 
through the Diet," Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the main 
opposition party, told a news conference. Mori blamed the 
cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for the long 
delay in the Diet budget debate, saying it put off the 
formulation of the budget from the usual year-end till this year 
to give top priority to political reform. "At the time, Mr. Hata 
was deputy prime minister," he said, indicating Hata should also 
be blamed for the delay in passage of the state budget, which is 
six weeks overdue. 
  Mori also said the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
[SDPJ], a member of Hosokawa's ruling coalition that collapsed 
in April, share a perception that Hata's minority government 
does not reflect the will of the Japanese people. 
  The SDPJ also sees the Hata cabinet as one to only handle 
the 
budget, Mori added. 
  The SDPJ walked out of the coalition shortly after Hata was 
elected premier in late April, in protest against the formation 
by other coalition partners of a new parliamentary group 
excluding the SDPJ. After the withdrawal of the SDPJ from the 
coalition, the LDP and the SDPJ, archrivals for decades, have 
moved to cooperate to put pressure on the Hata administration.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- The government should curb 
spending by more than 7 trillion yen to limit dependence on 
bonds, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  The ministry presented its fiscal reform policy with a 
five-year budget outlook through fiscal 1997 in a report 
submitted to the Budget Committee of the House of 
Representatives, which started deliberations on the fiscal 1994 
budget Tuesday. 
  The report takes into account neither the planned income and 
other tax cuts for calendar 1994 nor the deficit-covering bonds 
to cover the tax cuts since the ruling coalition parties are 
still to decide on permanent tax reform by the end of the year. 
  Given such uncertainties, the ministry does not actually 
believe future budgets will match the estimates of the report, a 
budget bureau official told reporters. 
  The report said budget outlays must be reduced by more than 
7 
trillion yen annually over three years starting in fiscal 1995 
to match the anticipated tight revenues and avoid excessive bond 
issuance. 
  On the revenue side, the ministry estimates that 850 
trillion 
yen from bonds must be trimmed annually to hold bond revenues to 
5 percent of the budget outlays in fiscal 1999. 
  The share of bond revenues in the fiscal 1994 budget is 
estimated at 18.7 percent, up from 11.2 percent in the initial 
fiscal 1993 budget and the highest since 19.4 percent in fiscal 
1987. 
  The report came after the ministry postponed its five-year 
target of reducing bond reliance to 5 percent of the budget by 
fiscal 1995. 
  When accounting for fiscal reform, the ministry expects the 
outstanding bond balance, excluding 3.13 trillion yen in 
deficit- financing bonds to cover the tax cuts, to peak in 
fiscal 2002 at 211.40 trillion yen after rising steadily from 
197.50 trillion yen in fiscal 1994. 
  If red-ink bonds for covering the tax cuts are included, the 
ministry estimates the balance will top 200 trillion yen for the 
first time in fiscal 1994 to reach 201 trillion yen. 
  But even if the bond balance peaks in fiscal 2002, the 
ministry estimates it will remain at the 200 trillion yen level 
until at least fiscal 2007. 
  The ministry has been insisting the government tackle the 
swelling bond balance since higher debt-servicing costs would 
put a squeeze on policy expenditures.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii expressed concern Tuesday [17 May] that the delay in 
getting the fiscal 1994 budget through parliament could put a 
damper on the economy, and stressed the need to limit the 
adverse effects. 
  "I can't deny that a long delay in (passing) the budget will 
affect the economy," Fujii told a regular news conference after 
a morning cabinet meeting. 
  Diet deliberations for the full 40 trillion yen budget for 
fiscal 1994 that started April 1 have been deadlocked because of 
political turmoil, and are to resume later Tuesday. 
  With about two months usually needed for a full budget to 
pass the Diet, however, the government decided last week to 
supplement for 40 days an already implemented 50-day 11 trillion 
yen stopgap budget that expires Friday. 
  "We must minimize the effects," Fujii added. But he did not 
spell out any concrete measures, saying the necessary public 
works and other outlays are included in the provisional budget. 
  The minister said, however, that fresh outlays in 
policy-related areas, such as infrastructure spending under the 
government's stimulus package, cannot be included in the planned 
supplementary budget, just as they could not be in the expiring 
stopgap budget. 
  Fujii said that he emphasized the importance for Japan to 
detail deregulatory steps in line with the March market-opening 
package during related ministerial talks held before the cabinet 
meeting. 
  Noting that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata "strongly" called 
for 
political leadership at each ministry and agency, Fujii said the 
Finance Ministry will positively consider deregulation in 
financial services and insurance, which are particularly 
mentioned in the package. 
  But he said deregulation may cause some "pain" such as 
unemployment, and called for steadily implementation of the jobs 
and other welfare measures included in the full budget.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Vice Finance Minister Jiro 
Saito restated Monday [16 May] his worries about the delayed 
fiscal 1994 budget and confirmed that a planned supplementary 
stopgap budget will not include new policy outlays. 
  "With no new policy measures such as fresh public works, I 
can't say that there will be no effects on the economy at all," 
Saito told a regular news conference. 
  Last week, the government decided to supplement a 40-day 11 
trillion yen provisional budget on the 40 trillion yen budget 
for fiscal 1994 that started April 1. The stopgap budget 
expires on May 20. 
  Diet deliberations on the full budget, deadlocked due to 
political turmoil, is expected to begin soon with still 
lingering uncertainties. 
  Saito said details of the planned supplementary budget is 
still undecided, but noted that new policy outlays will not be 
included as in the provisional budget. 
  "That's why we are calling for early passage of the full 
budget," he said. 
  Turning to tax issues, Saito said current laws do not allow 
for different advisory panels to the prime minister to form a 
joint subcommittee, thus denying such reported plans by the tax 
and administrative reform committees. 
  He also brushed aside reports that some members of the 
coalition parties are insisting that deciding on permanent 
income tax cuts alone and leaving offsetting tax hikes would be 
sufficient measures to take as Japan promised to do only that in 
its March market-opening package. 
  "I shouldn't comment on things that I haven't heard," saito 
said. 
  But referring to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's policy 
speech, 
he noted, "we are to decide on full tax reform in June and make 
it into law by the end of the year."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- The leader of the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) told Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday [17 May] that the LDP plans to demand 
his resignation after the Diet enacts the fiscal 1994 national 
budget, a senior LDP official said. 
  "When the budget is acted upon, we will again call on you to 
shape up," LDP President Yohei Kono said in a meeting with Hata, 
an indication that the party will submit a no-confidence motion 
against the three-week-old Hata cabinet. 
  Describing the Hata administration as "a government under 
abnormal circumstances," Kono pressed the premier to be aware 
that his government is a minority one, LDP Secretary General 
Yoshiro Mori told a news conference. 
  The remarks apparently reflect Kono's notion that the Hata 
cabinet will have completed its duties when the key budget 
clears the diet. 
  The encounter between Hata and Kono, the first since Hata 
took office April 28, was the first in a series of meetings with 
leaders of political parties outside the governing coaliton. 
  Later Tuesday, Hata also met Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, new party Sakigake leader Masayoshi 
Takemura and Michihiko Kano, head of new party Mirai, in efforts 
to seek cooperation on such major issues as the Diet budget 
debate, political reform and tax system reform. 
  In response to the premier's call for the LDP's cooperation 
in Diet debate on the budget, Kono made it clear his party is 
ready to extend a helping hand if the government admits its 
responsibility for the delay in budget discussion, Mori said. 
  The heads of the SDP, Sakigake and Mirai also expressed a 
desire to cooperate in passing the budget, now overdue by one 
and a half months, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Naoto Kitamura 
told a separate news conference. 
  On political reform, however, Murayama told reporters he has 
expressed his concern about the ruling parties' apparent move to 
give higher priority to debate on a yet-unformulated bill that 
demarcates new constituenies for House of Representatives 
elections. 
  Takemura, the chief cabinet secretary under former prime 
minister Morihiro Hosokawa, also said he has told Hata the 
government should leave the matter of a new electoral map up to 
an independent council of seven experts established within the 
Prime Minister's Office. 
  During a talk with Murayama, Hata reportedly sought the 
SDP's 
cooperation on policy issues and renewed his call for the party 
to return to the ruling coalition. 
  The SDP, the largest contingent in Hosokawa's ruling 
coalition, departed the union after other coalition partners 
abruptly formed a new parliamentary group, excluding the SDP. 
The move forced Hata to form the first minority government in 
39 years. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, who accompanied 
Hata 
in the series of talks, told a news conference he has a feeling 
the leaders of the four parties "are warmly evaluating Hata's 
efforts" to tackle a number of challenges. 
  "Spring has come today, that's how I feel right now," the 
top 
government spokesman said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and Uzbekistan President Islam Karimov issued a joint statement 
Tuesday [17 May] outlining the framework for future bilateral 
relations, foreign ministry officials said. 
  Hata and Karimov, who arrived in Japan on Monday for a 
four-day visit, signed the statement at the prime minister's 
official residence prior to holding talks, the officials said. 
  The statement said Japan and Uzbekistan agreed that 
"expansion of political dialogue is a beneficial and effective 
way to promote bilateral relations and affirmed the importance 
of exchanging opinions on matters of mutual interest, including 
international and regional problems." 
  The two sides also confirmed that treaties and international 
agreements concluded between Japan and the former Soviet Union 
have been applied and remain effective between Japan and 
Uzbekistan "with the exception of those which cannot 
meaningfully exist" between the two nations, it said. 
  Foreign ministers Koji Kakizawa of Japan and Saidmukhtar 
Saidqasymov of Uzbekistan exchanged letters confirming that, it 
said. 
  The statement also said Uzbekistan "expressed the hope that 
Japan would become a permanent member of the UN Security Council 
and fulfill its relevant responsibilities." 
  The two nations affirmed that they would contribute to 
enhancing the role and authority of the United Nations and would 
cooperate to achieve the aims of the UN Charter, according to 
the statement. 
  Both sides also affirmed their intention to consult and 
cooperate at the UN and other international organizations to 
maintain international peace and security to contribute to the 
peaceful resolution of conflicts, it said. 
  Japan voiced hope that Uzbekistan would contribute to 
maintaining stability in central Asia while the Uzbek side 
expressed its intention to play an active role there, the 
statement said. 
  Uzbekistan also vowed to accomplish large-scale 
privatization 
to promote reconstruction of its economy and to improve the 
welfare of the people, it said. 
  Japan gave high marks to Uzbekistan's economic reforms and 
welfare policies and voiced support for such efforts. Japan 
also unveiled plans to extend a wide range of technical 
assistance in such fields as economic management, it said. 
  Japan and Uzbekistan also shared concern over environmental 
problems in Uzbekistan exemplified by those in the Aral Sea and 
agreed on the importance of environmental protection, the 
statement said.

  [Text] Narita, Chiba Pref., May 17 KYODO -- Thirty 
Japanese volunteers from the Japan International Cooperation 
Agency arrived at Narita Airport Tuesday [17 May] after fleeing 
strife-torn Yemen via Paris. 
  The group included five medical and technical experts and 25 
Japan Overseas Cooperation volunteers and family members, agency 
officials said. 
  The only Japanese remaining in Yemen are five Japanese 
Embassy officials in Sanaa. Some 100 Japanese have already left 
the country, the Foreign Ministry said. 
  The embassy advised Japanese residents and tourists to 
evacuate Sanaa on May 7, three days after the Yemeni Government 
declared a state of emergency because of fighting between 
northern and southern army units and shelling in the capital.

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- The schedule for the July 
summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers in Naples has 
now taken shape, Foreign Ministry sources said Monday [16 May]. 
  The sources said that according to a provisional schedule 
worked out among the sherpas, or the personal representatives of 
the G-7 leaders, the summit leaders will begin their dialogue 
with a working dinner on the evening of July 8. 
  The leaders will consider economic issues in a formal 
session 
on July 9, a day which will also see the release of an economic 
declaration, as well as separate meetings among the foreign 
ministers and the finance ministers of the G-7. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin will make his first 
appearance at the Naples summit on the evening of July 9, when 
he attends a banquet. 
  On July 10, Yeltsin will join in political deliberations 
among the G-7 leaders on specific topics such as the former 
Yugoslavia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. But the sources 
said there remain other topics to be discussed only among the 
G-7 countries themselves. 
  Later in the day, the G-7 countries will issue a chairman's 
summary and a political declaration. Along with Russia, the 
economic powers will also issue a political statement regarding 
the former Yugoslavia. 
  In the case of previous summits, the Kremlin leader only 
joined the G-7 leaders after their talks were already finished 
for a special "G-7-plus-one" session. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nemuro, Hokkaido, May 14 KYODO -- A 48-member 
Japanese delegation left Nemuro by ship Saturday [14 May] 
morning for Etorofu Island, one of four disputed Russian islands 
claimed by Japan, under a visa-free exchange program. 
  Organizers said the group include 24 former residents of the 
island and nine members involved in a campaign for the return to 
Japan of Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai Group of 
islets. 
  The latest group of Japanese to make a visa-free visit to 
the 
Russian-held islands off Hokkaido's eastern tip will land at 
Etorofu on Sunday morning and later tour the island, the 
organizers said. 
  On Monday, the group will visit Japanese graves, a school 
and 
a fish processing plant. The group will return to Nemuro on 
Tuesday. 
  Another group returned to Nemuro Friday after two nights on 
Kunashiri under the three-year-old visa-free exchange program. 
It was the first group of the year to travel to the disputed 
islands. 
  A Russian group visited Hokkaido in April. 
  The four islands were overrun by Soviet troops at the end of 
World War II.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2230 GMT on 14 May in its 75-minute "FNN News 2001" 
talk show carries a 33-minute live interview with Yuichi 
Ichikawa, acting Komeito Chairman. The program is moderated by 
Yuji Kuroiwa and Megumi Sekito. Keio University professor 
Yoshiaki Kobayashi, a regular guest on the program, and 
commentator Yoshimi Ishikawa also take part. 
  The interview with Ichikawa begins at 2315 GMT. Moderator 
Kuroiwa reviews recent political turmoil caused by the secession 
of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) from the 
coalition following the formation by its partners of the Kaishin 
parliamentary group and then asks why Komeito did not join 
Kaishin. 
  Ichikawa says: "Frankly speaking, our party was not asked to 
join the group." 
  He explains how the group was formed, noting that "although 
the Kaishin group was established, it is not functioning well." 
  He adds: "Komeito will see how the situation develops, and 
we hope the SDPJ will come back to the coalition," saying no one 
wanted to see further discord between the coalition and the SDPJ. 
  Ichikawa is asked to comment on the resignation of Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party) member Nagano as justice minister to take 
responsibility for his careless remarks on the Nanjing Massacre. 
  He says: "I think within Shinseito, which is a breakaway of 
the Liberal Democratic Party, there are some members who share 
Nagano's view. However, that does not mean Nagano's remarks 
represent Shinseito's view." 
  He is also asked about Komeito's policy toward North Korea. 
  Ichikawa says: "Our party has three principles. First, the 
issue should be solved through tenacious negotiation between 
North Korea, South Korea, China, and the United States. Second, 
Japan should follow the United Nations, which will probably make 
a decision if negotiations end in failure. 
  "However, as the issue closely concerns Japan's security, it 
is not something to be left to a United Nations' decision or 
U.S. action." 
  He says that if the United Nations should fail to adopt a 
resolution, "Japan should act in close cooperation with South 
Korea and the United States. This our party's third principle." 
  Ichikawa discusses current relations between Komeito and 
religious group Soka-Gakkai, a major supporter of the party, 
saying the group has not influenced party policy. He says 
Komeito has not violated the principle of the separation of 
religion and politics. 
  Asked about the possibility of holding a general election 
under the current electoral system, Ichikawa says: "This would 
not only break the new electoral system but would set back the 
effects of the reforming Political Funds Law designed to prevent 
political corruption." 
  He says: "We should never hold elections under the current 
system" because it would undermine all political reform efforts 
so far.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 15 KYODO -- The Korean situation tops 
the list of international problems that interest Japanese people 
in connection with the nation's defense, a government survey 
showed Sunday [15 May]. 
  The survey by the Prime Minister's Office showed that 34 
percent of respondents said they are interested in the Korean 
situation. Relations between the United States and Russia, and 
Russia's military deployment on islands it holds off Hokkaido, 
Japan's northernmost main island, each recorded 31 percent. 
  On the Korean peninsula, tensions are high because of 
international disputes over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
project. 
  The Middle East situation led the list at 56 percent in the 
previous survey in 1991, when the Gulf war occurred. 
  In the January survey, the ninth of its kind since 1969, the 
Prime Minister's Office polled 3,000 people aged 20 and older 
throughout Japan on their awareness about the Self-Defense 
Forces (SDF) and defense issues. Sixty-nine percent responded. 
  Concerning SDF participation in peacekeeping activities 
overseas, 48 percent said they approve such action, up from 46 
percent in the previous poll, while 31 said they oppose it, up 
from 28 percent. 
  Asked about future roles the SDF should play, 34 percent 
cited dispatch in the case of natural disasters, while 24 
percent emphasized protection of national security. 
International contributions stood at 22 percent. 
  On the scale of defense capabilities, 66 percent favored 
maintaining the current level, up 4 percentage points from the 
previous survey.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Japan resumed Monday [16 
May] accepting trade insurance coverage for Bulgaria, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said. 
  As a first step, the government will establish a credit line 
of 200 million dollars for the east European country on 
condition that the country smoothly repays outstanding external 
debts in line with rescheduling accords in the latest meeting of 
the Paris Club of western creditor nations, MITI said. 
  The restart of Bulgaria-bound trade insurance coverage came 
after Japan's assessment of the recent economic developments in 
the country, including its accord with the International 
Monetary Fund on economic reforms, MITI said. 
  Japan had suspended accepting trade insurance for Bulgaria 
after the country froze external debt repayments in March 1990. 
  The Paris Club in its April meeting agreed on a 10-year 
rescheduling for part of Bulgaria's official debts totaling an 
estimated 4 billion to 5 billion dollars, including a grace 
period of six years.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 15 KYODO -- A majority of Japanese 
polled do not have faith in bureaucrats because they do not 
place priority on the interests of people, a survey by the 
country's leading daily showed Sunday. 
  The survey conducted by the ASAHI SHIMBUN found that 51 
percent of the respondents said they do not have confidence in 
bureaucrats, while 44 percent said they can rely on them. 
  The negative tendency was stronger among younger 
respondents, 
with more than 60 percent of pollees in their 20s and 30s saying 
they do not trust bureaucrats. 
  When asked about politicians, 61 percent said they do not 
have faith in them. 
  The ASAHI conducted the survey May 8 to 9, covering 3,000 
people nationwide aged 20 or older. Eighty percent or 2,407 
responded. 
  Sixty-three percent said bureaucrats put the interests of 
firms, industries and their own ministries and agencies before 
those of people, while only 14 percent said that bureaucrats are 
thinking about the interests of people. 
  Regarding policy decisions, 56 percent said bureaucrats have 
more power than the ruling political parties. When asked how 
they feel about the bureaucrat-led decision-making system, 
however, 45 percent said people should not have any say in the 
matter, while 44 percent responded the system is unavoidable. 
  More than 70 percent said they have a bad image of 
bureaucrats, and 28 percent of those respondents said they are 
not flexible, and 22 percent said they have a strong desire for 
promotion. 
  Those who responded favorably toward bureaucrats, saying 
they 
are able or are committed, stood at only 21 percent. 
  On why there are so many regulations in Japan, 33 percent 
said industries are trying to protect their own interests, while 
29 percent replied bureaucrats are sticking with their own 
prerogatives. Twenty-eight percent said such regulations are 
necessary to preserve the order of society.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Two senior members of former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) 
proposed Monday [16 May] disbanding a four-party parliamentary 
group called Kaishin (Innovation), political sources said. 
  JNP legislators Satsuki Eda and Satoshi Arai filed the 
proposal with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the sources said. 
  Kaishin comprises 130 members in the House of 
Representatives 
of four coalition parties -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
JNP, the Democratic Socialist Party and Jiyuto (Liberals) -- 
plus five independents. 
  The April 25 establishment of Kaishin led to the departure 
of 
the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] from the 
ruling coalition, forcing Hata to form a minority government. 
  Kaishin ranks second in terms of strength in the lower house 
only after the main opposition party, the Liberal Democratic 
Party.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) and new party Sakigake, which both quit the ruling 
coalition last month, agreed Monday [16 May] to initiate policy 
talks, officials of the two parties said. 
  The talks will cover Japan's response to North Korea's 
suspected nuclear arms program, tax system reform and rice 
prices, the officials said. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Sakigake leader Masayoshi 
Takemura reached the agreement in a meeting Monday, they said. 
  The SDP, the country's no. 2 opposition party, left the 
coalition late last month in protest over the establishment of a 
large parliamentary group that excluded it. 
  Sakigake earlier declared that it would not take cabinet 
posts but will cooperate with the cabinet of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata for some time, keeping its distance from the 
coalition.

  [Text] Members of peace groups, including local labor 
unions, held a peace rally in Kadena Township today, which marks 
the 22d anniversary of Okinawa's reversion to Japan. The rally, 
called the "Okinawan People's Rally To Protect Peace and 
Livelihood," was sponsored by the Okinawa Peace Movement Center. 
Approximately 3,000 participants, including members from local 
labor unions and other organizations, gathered at the rally held 
at Kaneku beachside park in Kaneku, Kadena Township. 
  At the rally, Zenshun Arakaki, chairman of the Okinawa Peace 
Movement Center, which sponsored the rally, first delivered a 
speech. He said: Even after the conclusion of the battle for 
Okinawa, the Okinawan people have been deprived of their human 
rights under U.S. military rule. Twenty-two years have passed 
since the reversion of Okinawa to Japan, but damages continue to 
be inflicted upon Okinawa due to U.S. military exercises and 
accidents. Recently, it was disclosed that there exists a secret 
deal which was concluded between the Japanese and U.S. 
Governments regarding Japanese approval of the U.S. military's 
bringing nuclear weapons to Okinawa in case of emergencies. We 
cannot allow a situation like this at all. We must now join our 
hands to turn Okinawa into a peaceful island. 
  Later at the rally, representatives from various 
participating organizations delivered speeches, expressing 
opposition to war and advocating peace. Most of the 
participants at the rally were those who started marching on 13 
May from various locations in the island in the peace parade, 
during which they walked the streets and appealed for peace. 
The participants, whose faces were sun-tanned, listened 
attentively to the speeches. The rally concluded after the 
participants adopted a resolution calling for immediate removal 
of U.S. military bases and clarification about the issue of the 
secret deal regarding bringing nuclear weapons to Okinawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Three senior Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) legislators, widely dubbed the "YKK 
Trio," on Monday [16 May] launched a new policy study group free 
from factional shackles. 
  The three vocal opposition politicians are former 
construction minister Taku Yamasaki, former chief cabinet 
secretary Koichi Kato and former posts and telecommunications 
minister Junichiro Koizumi. The name YKK trio is based on the 
initials of their family names. 
  "The group new century," headed by Kato, aims to "reform the 
party, create politics suitable for a new era and open up a new 
frontier for the future Japan," according to the group's 
constitution. 
  The group, which brought together over 60 LDP lawmakers, 
openly lashed out at Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), the core 
ruling party headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata but widely 
believed to be controlled by Ichiro Ozawa, the chief coalition 
strategist. 
  It blames Shinseito for inheriting the money-drenched 
politicking style of the LDP and for trying to manipulate the 
coalition government from behind the scenes. 
  The foundation of the new group within the LDP may 
accelerate 
moves toward a major reconfiguration of political parties in 
Japan, political sources said. 
  As the YKK trio are deemed as the critics of the current LDP 
leadership, led by President Yohei Kono, the group new century 
may also help proliferate an antileadership sentiment within the 
party, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- The House of Representatives 
decided Monday [16 May] to defer a ballot on a pending motion to 
strip the ruling coalition's parliamentary kingpin of his 
chairmanship of the lower chamber's powerful steering committee, 
political sources said. 
  If passed by the lower chamber, the motion would relieve 
Shinseito elder statesman Keiwa Okuda of his duty as the head of 
the powerful panel, which sets the parliamentary agenda. 
  The 511-member lower chamber will be unable to convene a 
plenary session on Tuesday, because the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) leadership could not convince some SDP opponents of the 
motion into voting for it, the sources said. 
  The Democrats, the SDP's largest policy study group, is now 
defying the SDP leadership's instruction to vote for the motion, 
which was earlier submitted to the lower chamber's secretariat 
by the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  The SDP stormed out of the ruling coalition due to its rage 
over the coalition partners' abrupt decision on April 22 to form 
a unified parliamentary bloc excluding the SDP. It was 
considering presenting a unified parliamentary front with the 
LDP against the coalition, they said. 
  In view of the rift within the SDP ranks, the LDP dropped 
its 
earlier decision to demand a ballot on the motion at Tuesday's 
plenary session, deciding instead to wait for the SDP leadership 
to convince its dissidents, LDP officials said. 
  The LDP had expected the lower chamber to vote in favor of 
the motion, even if the socialists cast blank votes in view of 
the decision by the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) to vote for 
the motion, they said. The LDP has 206 lower house legislators, 
the SDP 74 and the JCP 15. 
  The LDP's tactics will prompt the SDP's democrats to 
intensify its bid to pressure the SDP leadership to instruct SDP 
legislators to scuttle the motion by voting against it, rather 
than merely casting blank votes, the sources said. 
  It requires eliminating the current standoff in the Diet 
steering committee by Tuesday to enable the ruling coalition to 
proceed with its original plan to table the long-overdue fiscal 
1994 budget bill onto the Diet floor on Wednesday, they said. 
  The passage of the full budget has already been delayed for 
six weeks, since the start of fiscal 1994 on April 1.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Three key government panels 
will form a joint conference to press the government to come up 
with an overall administrative reform plan that is vital to 
change the taxation system, sources close to the panels said 
Monday [16 May]. 
  The joint conference plan was agreed by the chairmen of the 
Tax Commission, the Economic Deliberation Council -- both 
advisory panels to the prime minister -- and the Fiscal System 
Council, an advisory body to the finance minister. 
  The conference, made up of 10 members sent by the panels, 
will study such issues as the scrapping and reorganization of 
government ministries and agencies and the further privatisation 
of public organizations. 
  It will present a concrete administrative reform plan to 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata by early June, the sources said. 
  They said panel leaders agreed that if they leave the 
long-proposed administrative reforms up to bureaucrats, the plan 
may lack substance. The leaders believe that the reforms should 
be carried out with the government taking the initiative, the 
sources added. 
  At present, Japan faces the needs to change its taxation 
system in order to implement income tax cuts designed to 
stimulate the flagging economy, the sources said. 
  Also, to cope with the rapid greying of the Japanese 
society, 
it is necessary to change the taxation system to secure funds to 
implement welfare programs for senior citizens, they added. 
  The panels have urged the government to promote 
across-the-board discussions between panels responsible for 
different fields, such as the economy and spending for social 
security and defense programs.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Japan needs to upgrade its 
social, economic and other infrastructures in order to enhance 
its appeal as a major destination for investment by foreign 
companies, an annual government report on international trade 
said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Such efforts would eventually contribute not only to 
expanding direct foreign investment in this country but also to 
raising the overall living standards of the Japanese people, 
according to the fiscal 1994 white paper released by the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry. 
  The paper said an overhaul of institutional systems that 
hamper smooth industrial activity in Japan would facilitate an 
inflow of reasonably priced high-grade foreign products into the 
country and help reduce production costs and living expenses. 
  The amount of foreign direct investment in Japan has been 
lower than that of foreign investment in any other major 
industrial country, the paper said. 
  Rules and regulations serving as barriers to the creation of 
new businesses need to be eased, corporate research and 
development activities should be reinforced and capital market 
regulations should be relaxed for more international financial 
transactions between Japan and abroad, it said. 
  These measures would smooth the way for industrial 
restructuring in Japan, helping it attain the chief goals of 
narrowing a price gap between home and abroad, and curtailing 
its huge global current account surplus. 
  The global trade structure has been changing rapidly 
following activation of capital and technology transfers beyond 
national boundaries which has been traced to the recent surge in 
international investment, the report said. 
  Growth of services trade, for example, has gathered momentum 
on commodities trade, with services trade accounting for 30 
percent of overall global trade, it said. 
  The white paper described investment as "the fountainhead" 
of 
global economic growth. 
  There is a clear correlation between investment and economic 
growth, it said, noting countries with an average annual 
investment of over 30 percent as a percentage against their 
gross domestic product (GDP) scored significantly high economic 
growth during 1989- 1991. 
  The white paper said investment is also effective in 
creating 
employment on a long-term basis, noting east Asian countries 
other than Japan, which recorded an increase in investment of 
around 10 percent during the 1980s, saw employment grow 2 to 3 
percent while Japan and European countries with lower investment 
growth scored a gain of only around 1 percent in their jobs 
markets. 
  The paper also noted South Korea, Taiwan and other newly 
industrializing economies (NIEs) in Asia achieved remarkably 
high economic growth after turning net investors in the early 
1990s, while industrialization in countries of the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) quickened after their active 
acceptance of foreign investment. 
  The paper said foreign investment in China, especially on 
its 
coastal areas, has been rising sharply, a factor pushing up the 
country's vibrant economic growth. 
  Vietnam has been emerging as a major destination of 
investment, reflecting the resumption of Japan's low-interest 
yen loans in 1992 and the lifting of U.S. trade sanctions 
against the country earlier this year, the white paper said. 
  It said Japan's mammoth current account surplus has been 
attributed to a chronic excess of its savings over investment. 
  In 1992, for example, Japan's savings came to 160 trillion 
yen and its investment 145 trillion yen, leaving a balance of 15 
trillion yen which was equal to the current account surplus for 
the year, the paper said. 
  In the United States, the current account balance has been 
in 
the red for years, due to massive net investment in the public 
sector stemming from the large budget deficit, the paper said. 
  The white paper forecast Japan's savings ratio will fall in 
the future in line with the rapid aging of the society, a factor 
expected to push down the black ink in the current account 
balance. 
  In order for Japan to play a key role in encouraging world 
investment activity, Japanese companies should conduct their 
business operations in a manner that would bring about the best 
interests for global systems of production, distribution and 
parts procurement, the white paper said. 
  Specifically, the paper said Japanese firms should stop 
taking advantage of east Asian countries simply as areas to 
secure a cheap labor force. 
  Japan also should take the initiative in promoting free 
trade 
in line with the spirit of the recently concluded Uruguay Round 
of multilateral trade negotiations, the paper said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- A survey on retail prices in 
Japan by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) 
indicates that consumers actually pay less for daily necessities 
than shown in the government's official monthly survey, MITI 
said Monday [16 May]. 
  MITI's own survey found that prices for 23 of 25 items 
posted 
lower price indexes than under the management and coordination 
agency's official monthly consumer prices survey. 
  The price index of video tapes, for example, was 171.3 in 
the 
February survey by the agency against 100 in the MITI survey 
conducted during the same month, MITI said. 
  A MITI official said at a news conference that MITI's survey 
is more reflective of the actual retail price trend in Japan 
under the growing emergence of discounters. 
  The official said MITI used price-evaluating methods 
including covering products sold in a bundle, such as videotapes 
and notebooks. 
  The MITI survey, the first of its kind in Japan, was 
intended 
to assess how the Japanese Government's deregulation policy has 
impacted prices on store shelves, the official said, apparently 
dismissing arguments that the government has been reluctant to 
narrow a large price gap between products at home and abroad. 
  The survey results can be taken to indicate that the 
purchasing power of Japanese consumers is stronger than 
generally believed, the official said. 
  Other products that showed a large price gap with the 
official price survey included long-sleeved white shirts with an 
index of 147, tissue paper at 127.9 and television sets at 
113.7, all against the base of 100 in the MITI survey. 
  The MITI survey, conducted in Tokyo, also found that price 
gaps are wide among the various store categories. 
  The average retail price index for the 25 items surveyed was 
87.2 among discount stores, 113.1 among convenience stores, 96.7 
among supermarket chains and 120.5 among department stores. 
  Such prices gaps from one store category to another indicate 
not only the intensity of the ongoing price war in the retail 
sector but also a sharp expansion in product choices available 
to the consumer, the MITI official said. 
  Among the polled items, men's underwear showed the sharpest 
price gap from one store to another, followed by tissue paper, 
videotapes and winter business suits, MITI said. 
  On the other hand, items such as shampoo, paper diapers and 
health beverages showed the smallest price gaps among stores, 
MITI said, apparently because they are sold at their makers' 
recommended prices.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Japan's chief economic 
planner said Monday [May 16] the nation's economy will stage a 
bona-fide recovery during the current fiscal year. 
  "The Japanese economy will likely get onto a path of 
full-fledged recovery during fiscal 1994," which started on 
April 1, said Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the Economic 
Planning Agency [EPA]. 
  The economy will receive a boost from brisk housing 
investments and income tax cuts, which will help reduce 
inventories of durable goods, he said. 
  He predicted consumer spending will pick up, thereby 
improving private-sector sentiment, and that capital investments 
will eventually start recovering. 
  Consumer spending and corporate capital investments are two 
main driving forces for the economy.

  [Text] Kobe, May 16 KYODO -- The first major consignment 
of foreign apples to enter Japan arrived at the western Japan 
port of Kobe from New Zealand on Monday [16 may] without fanfare. 
  The 19 ton shipment of apples represented the first 
significant importation of foreign apples since the government 
formally liberalized the domestic apple market in 1971. 
  Although Tokyo could have allowed imports of foreign apples 
at that time, it has long maintained an import ban on apples 
from major exporters such as the United States and New Zealand, 
citing concerns over the spread of moths or viruses. 
  But the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has 
decided to lift the import ban on U.S. and New Zealand apples, 
saying they have cleared the technical limitations that 
previously had barred them from Japan. 
  The first load of apples from New Zealand will go onto store 
shelves soon after passing inspection at the Kobe quarantine 
station. 
  Traders said a total of some 500 tons of foreign apples, 
including imports from the U.S., are expected to arrive this 
year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mutsuki Kato, minister of agriculture, </F>
forestry, and fisheries, by NHK announcer Yoshiaki Kawabata -- 
live relay from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries in Tokyo; from the "NHK News 7" program] 
  [Text] [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, thank you for waiting. This 
is your second time to become minister of agriculture, forestry, 
and fisheries. During your first term under the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] administration, I suppose you took the 
position that Japan would never import a single grain of rice. 
This time, after Japan accepted minimum market access under the 
Uruguay Round, the situation has changed drastically. How do 
you look at such a change in the situation? 
  [Kato] Under the situation where three Diet resolutions 
[opposing the liberalization of the rice market] existed, the 
Hosokawa administration decided to accept minimum access to the 
rice market. I look back with profound thoughts at events in 
the past. 
  [Kawabata] Let me ask you questions on specific issues. 
First, concerning the important issue of reviewing the food 
control system, different opinions have been expressed on this, 
and this is supposed to be discussed at the Agricultural 
Administration Council. The immediate question is whether the 
system should be revamped radically, including the possibility 
of abolishing the system altogether, or whether partial revision 
would be enough. What do you think, Mr. Kato? 
  [Kato] I think there is an emerging national consensus that 
the food control system should be revamped. As to what to do 
with the substance of the revisions, as you just said, this is 
being handled by the Agricultural Administration Council, and 
the council is in the process of listening to the views of the 
various sectors. I do not think it is proper for me to say 
things in advance. The important thing is to think of Japan's 
future, and take into consideration our bitter experience in the 
past, while pondering how to strike a balance between the need 
to secure stable supplies of rice and other grains, and the need 
to maintain the incentive for farmers. That is how I think of 
the food control system. 
  [Kawabata] However, what you are saying is very difficult to 
do. 
  [Kato] Yes. It is extremely difficult, and we do not expect 
to achieve that easily. 
  [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, among the consumers, many hold the 
opinion that they should be allowed to choose different 
varieties of rice freely. How will you deal with the 
liberalization of the distribution system? 
  [Kato] When you look back at the "Heisei rice upheaval 
[Heisei kome sodo]" last February and March, there were people 
who clamored for the freedom of choice when foreign rice was 
being blended with domestic rice, and there were those who 
favored selling foreign and Japanese rice separately in a set. 
Furthermore, the people have come to know very well the taste, 
cooking methods, and prices of foreign rice. I think we will 
have to take all this into consideration when handling this 
problem. 
  [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, are you basically in favor of promoting 
the liberalization of the distribution system? 
  [Kato] Deregulation will benefit the people greatly. I 
would like to consider how to implement this in a manner 
suitable under the existing conditions, and in a direction that 
will make rice more readily available to consumers and enhance 
more freedom of choice. 
  [Kawabata] Immediately after you took office, you said that 
correcting the price gap between foreign and Japanese rice -- 
the fact that compared to foreign rice, Japanese rice is 
extremely expensive -- is an important issue. What concrete 
steps will you take in this regard? 
  [Kato] In the case of the recent emergency rice imports, 
there was nothing we could do. The measures taken last year to 
deal with the economic recession also cost a lot of money. As I 
said earlier, there is the problem of Japanese rice costing 
300,000 yen a ton, while imported rice ranges from 40,000 to 
60,000 yen a ton. 
  Therefore, the job of the Hata administration is not only to 
correct the price gap between foreign and Japanese rice, but 
also work on the price gap for all daily necessities of the 
people. In this context, vigorous steps should be taken to 
narrow the price gap between Japan and foreign countries for 
agricultural, forestry, and fisheries products. I would like to 
manage agricultural administration in such a manner. 
  [Kawabata] I am sure that is what you think. Do you have 
anything specific in mind to narrow this price gap? 
  [Kato] Regardless of my own personal intentions, the people 
have come to realize keenly the price gap through the recent 
commotion about rice. There are various issues on which we are 
seeking the views of the Agricultural Administration Council in 
the near future that it would not be proper for me to say things 
in advance now. However, we should keep this problem very much 
in mind when dealing with agricultural administration from now 
on. Otherwise, a distrust of the agricultural administration may 
spread among the people, and this will be terrible. I would 
like to keep the price gap in mind as the central issue and take 
various measures in this regard. 
  [Kawabata] Mr. Kato, under a minority government, I would 
think it will be very difficult to resolve various issues. What 
do you think? 
  [Kato] That is why we will hold up high the banner of 
reform. The government belongs to the people, and it should 
serve the people. I believe precisely because we are a minority 
administration, if we appeal to the people directly in good 
faith, overcoming the boundary line between ruling and 
opposition parties, we will be able to open up prospects for the 
future. If we deal with the price gap issue and all other 
issues by listening to the voice of the people as the voice of 
heaven, I think things will turn out right. 
  [Kawabata] Let me go back to the rice issue, along with the 
acceptance of minimum access in the Uruguay Round, you are 
supposed to compile emergency measures on agriculture and the 
rural areas by July. Can this work be completed by July? 
  [Kato] Yes, I believe we will have to accomplish that. By 
that time, there will also be the problem of the producers' rice 
price. If we failed to compile the emergency measures, we will 
not be able to win the rice producers' and the people's 
understanding. I would certainly like to complete this task. 
  [Kawabata] Thank you.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 15 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry and the 
farm ministry made a secret arrangement last year to take 
special relief measures for debt-ridden agricultural cooperative 
financial institutions with low-interest loans from the Bank of 
Japan (BOJ), financial sources said Sunday [15 May]. 
  Financial institutions affiliated with agricultural 
cooperatives are saddled with bad loans provided to housing loan 
companies. 
  Admitting the existence of the secret arrangement, a senior 
Finance Ministry officials said two bureau chiefs of the 
ministry and the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry 
exchanged a memorandum in February 1993 promising that the 
central bank would extend necessary loans to the governmental 
Norinchukin Bank. 
  In return, agricultural cooperative-affiliated financial 
institutions under the umbrella of Norinchukin Bank agreed to 
lower or exempt interest on their loans to housing loan 
companies. The financial institutions had been reluctant to 
take such action in view of its impact on their business. 
  The bureau chiefs made the secret deal in the process of 
drawing up a relief package for Nippon Housing Loan Co., the 
nation's largest housing loan company, which has been ridden 
with large nonperforming loans. The deal was not announced at 
that time. 
  The memo agreed to provide reductions and exemptions of loan 
interest to help the farm cooperative-affiliated financial 
institutions, the sources said. 
  Such institutions provided 5.5 trillion yen in loans to the 
seven housing loan companies, accounting for about 40 percent of 
the total amount of borrowings of the housing loan companies. 
  The memo said the BOJ would provide necessary loans to 
Norinchukin Bank because it was feared interest reductions and 
exemptions for housing loan companies could negatively affect 
farm cooperative-affiliated financial institutions. 
  The seven housing loan companies -- Nippon Housing Loan Co., 
Japan Housing Loan Inc., Jyuso Inc., Diichi Housing Loan Co., 
Housing Loan Service Co., Sogo Jukin Co. and Chigin-Seihio 
Housing Loan Co -- are suffering due to bad loans worth 13.6 
trillion yen to realtors.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 15 KYODO -- The Bank of Japan [BOJ] has 
provided low-interest loans to the Norinchukin Bank in a secret 
deal between the Finance and Farm Ministries to help farm 
cooperative- affiliated financial institutions which gave huge 
loans to housing loan companies, a major national daily reported 
Sunday. 
  The ASAHI SHIMBUN said the central bank has provided from 
tens of billions of yen to about 100 billion yen in loans to the 
Norinchukin Bank under a memo exchanged between officials of the 
Finance Ministry and the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
Ministry in February of last year. 
  The memo also gives favorable treatment to farm 
cooperative-affiliated financial institutions under the umbrella 
of the Norinchukin Bank on the reduction and exemption of loan 
interest to help them, the daily said. Such institutions 
provided 5.5 trillion yen in loans to the housing loan 
companies, it said. 
  The memo was exchanged for relief measures for Nippon 
Housing 
Loan Co., the nation's largest housing loan company, and later 
applied to those for other housing loan companies, the daily 
said. 
  The memo says the BOJ will provide necessary loans to the 
Norinchukin Bank because it is difficult for farm cooperative- 
affiliated financial institutions to reduce and redeem interest 
on loans for housing loan companies. 
  The daily said seven housing loan companies are having 
financial difficulties due to bad loans to realtors, with the 
loans totaling 13.6 trillion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Major Japanese electronics 
firm Hitachi Ltd. said Monday [16 May] it will establish an 
electronic device design subsidiary in britain next month to 
bolster its operations overseas. 
  The Tokyo-based company said the new firm, Hitachi Micro 
Systems Europe Ltd., will engage in designing computer chips and 
support tools as well as development of application technologies. 
  The company said the new undertaking followed a capital 
increase of 1.5 million dollars in April by Hitachi Micro 
Systems Inc., its large-scale integrated circuit design unit 
established in California in 1978. 
  The company said it will continue to strengthen its design 
and development operations in the U.S. and Europe to meet the 
needs of local customers. 
  The company has been producing semiconductors at its German 
subsidiary established in 1980. 
  It said its production base in the U.S. will start 
manufacturing microcomputers this fall at a monthly volume of 
300,000 units.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Public works projects 
started in fiscal 1993 totaled a record 19,758.5 billion yen, up 
7.8 percent from the previous year, the Construction Ministry 
reported Monday [16 May]. 
  The figure, which marks the ninth straight yearly increase, 
reflects a series of government moves to bolster public works as 
part of its economic stimulus packages. 
  The central government, public corporations and other state 
agencies placed orders for 4,860.7 billion yen worth of the 
total, up 8.1 percent. 
  Projects financed by autonomies and other local agencies 
accounted for the remaining 14,897.8 billion yen worth, a 7.7 
percent increase. 
  Both figures are the highest on record. 
  The ministry also said public works investments during March 
soared 67.8 percent from a year earlier to 2,353.5 billion yen.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F>
program] 
  [Text] Three years ago a tube clogged with rust broke in 
the No. 2 reactor of the Kansai Power Electric Company's Mihama 
nuclear power plant. An inhouse company report has found out 
that similar problems have occurred at six other nuclear plants. 
  In the incident three years ago, one of the tubes in a steam 
generator at the Mihama No. 2 reactor broke and leaked a large 
amount of primary cooling water, used to cool fuel in the 
reactor. Investigators later found one of the tubes had broken 
because an antivibration bar had not been properly installed. 
They said that foreign objects, including rust, had accumulated 
in a small gap between a tube and the bar, which supported the 
tubes. The tube eventually became fixed and could not withstand 
vibration. 
  NHK, which obtained a copy of the Kansai Electric Power 
Company's inhouse report, says after the accident investigators 
took samples from tubes at nine other pressurized water 
reactors, which are similar to the Mihama No. 2 reactor. They 
confirmed the tubes had become fixed because a gap between the 
tube and a bar in six of the reactors had become clogged. The 
report says that each of the 30 to 40 tubes that were checked at 
the Mihama No. 3 reactor and the No. 2 Ohi reactor, which are 
still in operation, were clogged with rust and dust and 
completely fixed. 
  Kansai Electric officials say that even though the tubes 
were 
clogged with dust, they would not break like the one at the 
Mihama No. 2 reactor unless it was triggered by an accident. 
They say they intend to replace the steam generators, together 
with the tubes, over the next four years. Antinuclear groups, 
however, including citizens' group, say that the reactors should 
be closed down immediately.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Toshiba Corp. said Monday 
[16 May] it has developed an innovative high capacity 3.5-inch 
optical disk system that has a partial rewrite capability. 
  Data can be entered on the new optical disk using a modified 
phase-change process, allowing it to be either partially or 
totally deleted by overwriting, Toshiba said. 
  In phase-change optical disk drives, the reading and writing 
of data is achieved by converting the recording layer of the 
disk from an amorphous to a crystalline state and vice versa, 
using the heat emitted by a laser diode. 
  Toshiba said the system represents a dramatic improvement 
over conventional rewritable magneto-optical disk systems, in 
which stored data cannot be changed without first erasing the 
whole section on which amended data is to be entered. 
  The new optical disk will be suitable for application in a 
wide range of next-generation multimedia products that run on 
personal computers, Toshiba said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will hold a subcabinet-level meeting May 24 in Washington to 
discuss global cooperation, one of three areas in the bilateral 
trade "framework" talks, a senior Foreign Ministry official said 
Tuesday. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and Sozaburo 
Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs, will 
attend the meeting, the official said. Undersecretary of State 
Timothy Wirth will head the U.S. delegation. 
  The two countries are expected to discuss bilateral 
cooperation to battle illegal drugs, promote children's health, 
protect coral and observe geological processes, in addition to 
five fields that the two nations have been discussing under the 
framework talks, the official said. 
  Japan and the U.S. have been studying bilateral cooperation 
on the environment, technology, the development of human 
resources, population and AIDS. 
  Unlike the other two deadlocked areas of the framework talks 
-- macroeconomic and microeconomic areas -- the negotiations on 
global cooperation have seen some progress.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Japanese Trade Minister 
Eijiro Hata said Tuesday he hopes that subcabinet-level talks 
with the United States this week will pave the way for "a 
political decision" on resuming bilateral trade "framework" 
negotiations. 
  Speaking at a press conference, International Trade and 
Industry Minister Hata said the high-level talks will take place 
in Washington from Thursday. 
  Apart from the Washington talks, a subcabinet-level U.S. 
trade official may visit Tokyo in the near future, Hata said. 
  Hata said Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and 
industry minister for international affairs, and Sadayuki 
Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs, will be 
sent to Washington for the talks, the duration of which has yet 
to be fixed. 
  Hata said they will not carry "specific answers" to three 
new 
U.S. proposals presented to Tokyo in April as conditions for 
resuming the negotiations on a new framework for bilateral trade. 
  The two Japanese officials will strive to "bridge the 
perception gap" between the two countries, Hata said. 
  The framework talks have been deadlocked since the February 
summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The two sides have been at 
odds over the U.S.-proposed "objective criteria" for gauging 
American access to Japanese markets. 
  Turning to Russia's participation in political talks at the 
Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries 
in July, Hata said he personally supports the idea. 
  The global trend is moving toward accepting Russia as a new 
member of the G-7 club, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 KYODO -- Japan considers it to be 
"too early" for Russia to become a full member of the Group of 
Seven (G-7) economic powers, Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko 
Saito said Monday [16 May]. 
  Saito told a press conference that Tokyo considers it too 
soon to include Russia in all discussions at G-7 summits because 
Japan does not yet have a peace treaty with Russia and because 
Russia still does not have the same status as other G-7 nations 
despite its reform efforts. 
  Other G-7 nations also share the same view, Saito said. 
  Saito said, however, the "sherpa" or personal 
representatives 
of G-7 leaders, are currently discussing ways to hold dialogue 
with Russia during the G-7 summit talks. 
  The prevailing view in the sherpa meeting is that it is 
necessary to include Russia, at least partially, in discussions 
on political topics to which Russia has some connections, such 
as the problems in the former Yugoslavia, Middle East and 
Eastern Europe, Saito said. 
  But the sherpas are negative on including Russia in 
discussions on economic matters because although Russia is 
making reform efforts, it is still a recipient of economic and 
financial aid, he said.

  [Text] It is reported that the United States has ordered 
Sar Kheng, the cheap lackey puppet of the communist Vietnamese, 
to go urgently to America. What is the purpose of the U.S. 
order? 
  It is widely known that Sar Kheng is the arch traitor of the 
nation, the cheap lackey of the communist Vietnamese, and the 
most cruel and fascist agent of the communist Vietnamese. He is 
also part of the most corrupt and stinking clique. Sar Kheng is 
also a member of the communist party, a puppet of the communist 
Vietnamese, the head of the security forces, and a murderer who 
suppressed, arrested, and killed scores of Cambodian people for 
15 years from 1979 to the present time. His crimes are 
extremely serious. 
  As the communist Vietnamese's lackey, puppet, and 
instrument, 
he destroyed the Cambodian nation and people to turn Cambodia 
into a second Kampuchea Kraom, thereby eliminating the Cambodian 
race. How many Cambodian people have already been killed by the 
communist Vietnamese puppets Sar Kheng, Chea Sim, and Hun Sen 
and the communist Vietnamese? To what extent have those 
puppets allowed the communist Vietnamese to swallow Cambodia's 
terrestrial and maritime territory and islands? How many 
million ethnic Vietnamese have they allowed to flow into 
Cambodia? How far have they turned our Cambodian society upside 
down? How bad have the four or five million Vietnamese 
oppressed the Cambodian society and people? And how 
destructive have they plundered Cambodia's land, lakes, small 
and big rivers, fish, and forests? 
  The entire Cambodian nation and people reject and condemn 
the 
communist Vietnamese lackeys because of their actions, which 
betray the nation, sell out the nation, and destroy the nation 
and people. Now they have fallen into the abyss of death. They 
are agonizing; their days are numbered. 
  How far can the communist Vietnamese puppets survive with 
U.S. aid and arms supply? How can the puppets be saved when 
the U.S. ringleader and its alliance have not been able to 
rescue their own son [Ranariddh's party]? How can they save the 
rotten one-eyed (?puppet) of the communist Vietnamese when they 
are so rotten and stinking and have been opposed and condemned 
by the people? The communist Vietnamese have striven to cure 
the rotten puppets for 14 or 15 years, but in vain. They still 
remain decomposed and remain at death's door. 
  The only effective treatment is to achieve national 
reconciliation, national unity, and genuine peace.

<F P=106> [Political commentary: "A Stand Worthy of Welcome and </F>
Support"] 
  [Text] AFP on 13 May cited the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman saying that the Vietnamese Government was ready for 
peaceful negotiations on border problems between the two 
neighboring countries on the basis of mutual respect for 
independence and territorial integrity. 
  This statement from Vietnam came after King Norodom Sihanouk 
was quoted by the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW from an interview 
he gave to the magazine on 11 May as accusing Vietnam of moving 
the border postings deep inside Cambodia and digging canals 
inside the country. 
  Cambodia and Vietnam share a common terrestrial border of 
1,130 kilometers and the border problem has been a bone of 
contention between the two countries since the French 
colonialists left Indochina in the 1950's. 
  The border disputes between the two countries have remained 
outstanding. Moreover, there have been rumors that Vietnam has 
moved border markers into Cambodian territory in the Cambodian 
provinces bordering Vietnam on the west. 
  It should be recalled that during Vietnamese Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet's official visit to Cambodia last April, the two 
countries agreed to create an expert team to discuss and solve 
their land border conflict. 
  Vietnam, like Thailand, is a signatory to the Paris 23 
October 1991 accord. According to the accord's provisions, the 
two countries should respect Cambodia's territorial integrity 
and national unity and restrain themselves from interfering in 
the country's internal affairs. Following the establishment of 
the National Assembly and the formation of the Royal Government 
of Cambodia through the elections organized by the United 
Nations in May 1993, the Cambodian Constitution defined 
Cambodia's border in accordance with the 1/100,000 map of the 
1960's. Nevertheless, border issues in the eastern and western 
parts of Cambodia remain unsettled, resulting in endless 
conflicts and accusations. 
  With goodwill to achieve peace, security, and have good 
neighborliness, which contributes to restoring peace and 
security and promoting cooperation in the region as well as 
reinforcing world peace, the Cambodian people wish to 
enthusiastically welcome the aforementioned stance of the SRV 
Government and call on other neighbors of Cambodia to follow the 
fine example. Moreover, words and actions should move 
concurrently.

<F P=106> [Statement from Party of Democratic Kampuchea Spokesman </F>
dated 16 May; place not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] I. Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans has of 
late, openly and shamelessly declared that arms should be 
shipped to the two-headed government to further fan the flames 
of war against the Khmer Rouge. He has added that the shipping 
of arms to the two-headed government to fight the Khmer Rouge 
complies with the Paris accord. 
  II. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] wishes to ask 
the representatives of the signatory countries of the Paris 
accord whether the Australian foreign minister's statement is 
correct or contrary to the essence and spirit of the accord. 
  A. The Paris accord has already come to an end. However, if 
the accord is to be taken into consideration, it is asked 
whether the accord allows any country or power to provide arms 
to Cambodia and whether it has urged or incited any party to 
attack another party. No, not at all. 
  On the contrary, the Paris accord: 
  1. Forbids arms supply to every party; 
  2. Clearly stipulates that Cambodia should have four 
parties that are all equal and that no party should have the 
upper hand. 
  3. According to the essence and spirit of the accord, 
Cambodia should achieve national reconciliation, national unity, 
and genuine peace. 
  B. It is asked whether Gareth Evans' statement is correct or 
completely contrary to international law, the UN Charter, the 
principle of noninterference in other countries' internal 
affairs, and the respect for human rights and the rights to 
self-determination of each people. Is the Australian foreign 
minister's statement in line with or contrary to the above 
principles? Evidently, the provision of arms to the two-headed 
government is to allow the communist Vietnamese and their 
puppets to continue to destroy the Cambodian nation, people, and 
race. So will this action promote peace or just inflame the 
war? Will it alleviate the sufferings of the nation and people 
or only destroy the Cambodian nation and people? 
  III. It is obvious the Evans statement is to inflame the war 
in Cambodia. It is an utterance by warmongers who use the 
Cambodians serving as the communist Vietnamese and American 
puppets to attack patriotic Cambodians, to oppose peace, 
national reconciliation, and national compromise, and to fan the 
flames of war across Cambodia. This is aimed at causing 
continued suffering to the Cambodian people and concern to 
Cambodia's neighbors, thus once again complicating the situation 
in Southeast Asia. The action by Australia and other 
unscrupulous alliances is in collaboration with the communist 
Vietnamese to enable the latter to swallow and eliminate the 
Cambodian race, thereby allowing all of them to grab at Cambodia 
according to their disgusting, vested interests. 
  IV. The Cambodian nation and people as well as Democratic 
Kampuchea vehemently oppose the (?dirty) statement by the 
atheist warmonger Gareth Evans and the arms supplies to destroy 
the Cambodian nation and people. 
  [Dated] 16 May 1994 
  [Signed] Party of Democratic Kampuchea spokesman

<F P=106> [By Jean de Toulkork] </F>
  [Text] Contrary to a Cambodian newspaper report, senior 
ministers of the Cambodian government are not in favour of 
amending the constitution to enable King Norodom Sihanouk to 
enjoy full power for a limited time. 
  There is no support for the idea in the ruling FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] party of First Prime Minister Norodom 
Ranariddh, according to party sources. 
  A well-placed source in the Cambodian People's Party [CPP] 
that is the political umbrella of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen 
said the party would listen to the proposal, be polite, but 
completely ignore it. 
  But the coalition government is having trouble administering 
the country and there is bickering among members of the royalist 
FUNCINPEC party. 
  In the provinces, the newly appointed provincial governors 
of 
FUNCINPEC find themselves blocked by an administration 
controlled by the CPP. As the governor of one of the country's 
largest provinces recently pointed out: "I advance one step and 
then go three backward. Everything I try to do is blocked by my 
deputy who used to be the CPP's previous governor." 
  In the capital, Phnom Penh, things are not much better. The 
only ministry that seems to be working in a coordinated fashion 
is the ministry of finance because FUNCINPEC's Sam Rangsi is 
related to his CPP deputy, Cham Prasit. 
  The national assembly has been paralysed since the CPP 
decided to get it to approve the re-admission of Prince Norodom 
Chakkrapong and Sin Son, a former national security minister, 
both of whom were involved in the short-lived secession of seven 
Cambodian provinces immediately after the May 1993 elections. 
  Important legislation for Cambodia's future remains blocked 
until the impasse over Chakkrapong and Sin Son can be solved. A 
formula has now been proposed by which the order of the agenda 
of the assembly's meetings will be changed to allow the passage 
of at least some legislation. 
  King Sihanouk has been giving recent visitors a very sombre 
picture of today's Cambodia and has strongly criticised the 
leaders of the royal government for not looking after the 
interests of the people. 
  At the same time, he has said that many people have asked 
him 
to try to redress the situation. 
  In public, the king says he is too old, in bad health and 
does not have the team that can take control of the situation 
and stop Cambodia from "sinking like the Titanic". 
  In fact, the ailing king is said to think otherwise. But he 
would need an ally in the CPP, which continues to control the 
country even though FUNCINPEC won, by however small a margin, 
the United Nations organised elections a year ago. 
  In the light of this political imperative, and in view of 
the 
king's cooler relations with Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, 
insiders point to the monarch's recent repeated praise for Chea 
Sim, the CPP strongman. 
  Chea Sim and his wife visited the king in Peking in March 
but 
little is known of their discussions apart from Chea Sim's 
expression of deep concern over events in Cambodia. 
  Even if Sihanouk were to form an alliance with Chea Sim by 
which the king is given certain but not full powers, the 
question would remain as to what to do with the Khmer Rouge 
insurgency. 
  Would Chea Sim allow the king to give some posts to some 
Khmer Rouge officials? The other question that concerns many 
Cambodians is what kind of powers the CPP would grant to the 
king and how the party administration would react to the new 
arrangement. 
  The call for new elections made by the king last week has 
not 
been taken seriously by any of the parties concerned and the 
issue appears dead. Sihanouk is now retreating to Peking, from 
where he will observe events in Cambodia, and perhaps hope that 
a call will come for him to save the "ship Kampuchea" from 
sinking, through a new and last royal crusade.

<F P=106> [Message from Interior Minister Yu Hokkri -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] My respects to the two supreme patriarchs, all 
venerable monks, and my beloved compatriots: 
  I, Yu Hokkri, minister of the interior, would like to 
present 
the following announcement from the Interior Ministry: 
  In compliance with the message dated 15 May of His Majesty 
Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, revered king of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia, in which he appealed to all brothers, sisters, 
children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren to not hold the 
demonstration on 16 and 17 May so as to avoid any incidents 
which might bring about adverse consequences that will further 
complicate the solution that we are seeking for our motherland 
through peaceful means in line with Lord Buddha's teachings, 
Venerable Monk (Vichea Ratanapannha Wilson) and (Sit Kosangsin), 
representatives of the Kampuchea Kraom Buddhist Association, and 
the Cambodian Youth Association have decided to cancel their 
planned demonstration. 
  At the same time, a group of people have distributed false 
letters calling on the public to join demonstrations or meetings 
on 17 May in the name of the two associations mentioned above. 
  Venerable Monk (Vichea Ratanapannha Wilson) and (Sit 
Kosangsin) have rejected any undertaking that run counter to the 
wish and desire of the revered his majesty the king, who is the 
father of national peace. 
  The Interior Ministry would like to stress also that until 
now, the ministry has not received any new requests for holding 
the demonstration. 
  It is with the goal of ensuring security and public order 
that I would like your venerable personages and the public to 
please be informed. 
  Thank you.

<F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh -- The Ministry of Economics and Finance 
has introduced taxes aimed at curbing the spiraling land prices 
here. 
  The proposed land tax is composed of 3 sub-taxes. These are, 
a tax on undeveloped land bought for purposes of speculation, a 
tax on land price increases and a tax on capital assets. 
  The objective of the first tax is to "eliminate the buying 
and selling of land which is causing land prices to rise, 
leading to problems for foreign investors", according to a 
ministerial statement. 
  "In particular, the intention is to make owners of such 
unused land pay taxes to the state, or encourage them to sell or 
rent their land to businessmen looking for a base for their 
industrial or commercial operations," the statement added. 
  The rate of this tax would rise progressively in proportion 
to the time over which the land stays undeveloped. For example, 
the state would tax two per cent on the cost price of the land 
for the first year and thereby increase this by two per cent 
each year, so that by the fifth year, owners of undeveloped land 
would have to pay 10 per cent of the land's cost price. 
  The second tax, which is aimed at discouraging the rise in 
land prices, that is owned privately and by commercial companies. 
  For land owned by private individuals, this land tax rate 
would be the same as that levied for personal income. That is, 
10 per cent to 30 per cent on the profit gained on the land at 
the time of resale. 
  In the case of commercial companies, profits on land sales 
would be taxed the same rate as for other profits, at 20 per 
cent. 
  The tax on capital assets has been confined by the Ministry 
to a yearly tax levied on the third house, or more, owned by a 
private individual in a town. 
  The tax, with a rate of two to three per cent of the 
estimated market price of the house, is designed not to penalise 
farmers or those living in the countryside. 
  The system of land taxes is welcome news for investors, 
especially the tax on undeveloped land bought for purposes of 
speculation. The recent visit of the business delegation from 
Malaysia highlighted the problem of escalating land prices and 
the lack of industrial parks for setting up labour-intensive 
industries. 
  Businessmen pointed out that the favourable conditions 
created for investment and sustained by agencies like the 
Cambodia Development Council would be crippled by the 
unavailability of competitively priced land. This includes not 
only the kingdom's capital but outlying urban centres like 
Sihanoukville. 
  However, some observers say that the taxes are not 
differentiated enough, especially the tax charged on land 
speculation. Investors might need to hold on to land until 
conditions are deemed more propitious for developing it, given 
the security situation. 
  The solution would lie in the comprehensive nature of the 
new 
tax regime introduced by Sam Rangsi's Ministry. These include 
the Salaries Tax, the Tax on Construction Licenses and the 
Profits Tax on import-export companies. Their overall objective 
is to "broaden the revenue base which is at present heavily 
dependent on customs duties, particularly those levied on 
reexports". 
  The Minister has already declared that the objective of the 
tax reforms is to achieve a more balanced distribution between 
direct and indirect taxation, and to avoid over-reliance on 
customs revenue. 
  Most of the foreign companies in the kingdom indicate their 
presence here as involving commercial and social obligations. 
Their projections for rates of return are based on medium-term 
and longterm investment strategies. 
  The reform of the customs' systems and its fiscal structure 
has already managed to increase government revenue eightfold. 
This has allowed the government to fund its public sector 
deficit without having to demonetise the currency. It has also 
allowed the control of the previous runaway inflation. 
  The new tax regime is aimed at further stabilising the 
economic environment towards encouraging investment 
possibilities.

  [Excerpt] Indonesia and New Zealand have agreed that New 
Zealand deputies need to visit Indonesia. Minister and State 
Secretary Murdiono said this when he briefed reporters on the 
results of talks between President Suharto and Prime Minister 
Jim Bolger in Jakarta this morning. He said the two leaders 
agreed that such visits would be beneficial. The minister said 
Bolger did not bring a petition on East Timor from New Zealand 
deputies. The prime minister simply asked the president about 
East Timor. Suharto said the East Timor people had decided to 
be part of Indonesia. Any resistance to the East Timor people's 
strong wish to remain part of Indonesia will be categorized as 
an act to undermine national security. 
  According to Murdiono, the two leaders also touched on 
matters to be discussed by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
[APEC] forum. [passage omitted on Mrs. Bolger's social 
acitivities in Jakarta]

  [Text] Indonesia welcomes New Zealand's endeavors in 
bringing peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. New 
Zealand's contributions toward such measures was observed 
through its active participation in the settlement of numerous 
conflicts -- such as the conflicts in Cambodia, Bougainville, 
Papua New Guinea, and others. This was stated by President 
Suharto during at dinner tonight in honor of the visiting state 
guest, the New Zealand prime minister James Bolger and his wife 
at the state palace in Jakarta. 
  He stated that the Government of Indonesia also welcomed New 
Zealand's efforts to have closer contacts with the Southeast 
Asian nations, particularly with Indonesia. In this regard, 
the head of state expressed hope that New Zealand would actively 
participate in the Asian regional fora where consultations on 
political and security issues on Southeast Asia are discussed. 
  Touching on other issues, President Suharto stressed that 
relations between Indonesia and New Zealand have improved in 
recent years due to the exchange of visits by high-level 
officials of the two countries aimed at fostering greater mutual 
trust and understanding. 
  Meanwhile, New Zealand Prime Minister James Bolger said that 
Indonesia had played an important role in the Cambodian peace 
process. As the current chairman of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation [APEC], Indonesia has agreed to host the upcoming 
historic meeting for leaders of the Asia-Pacific nations in 
November. Prime Minister James Bolger also stated that his 
country would support Indonesia in its campaign to secure a seat 
in the United Nations Security Council during the 1995-96 
session. 
  Prior to the dinner, the two leaders exchanged souvenirs at 
the foyer of the state palace. President Suharto presented a 
gilded Balinese traditional kris [dagger] and a silk shirt to 
his guest. Meanwhile, Mrs Tien Suharto presented a (?silver) tea 
set and a piece of silk cloth to Mrs. Bolger. Mr. and Mrs, 
Bolger presented a gilded wall decoration to President Suharto 
and his wife. 
  Vice President Sutrisno, his wife, cabinet minister, other 
high- ranking officials and their wives also attended tonight's 
dinner.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] PELITA and KOMPAS comment on the significance of the 
visit of New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger to Indonesia. 
PELITA notes that Bolger's visit is a bit cloudy because a 
handful of New Zealand deputies had issued a petition on human 
rights in East Timor. The matter, however, is not expected to 
become a major irritant. The petition appeared to have stemmed 
from their lack of understanding and knowledge about 
developments in East Timor. Accordingly, we need to conduct 
self-assessment as to what extent we have provided them with 
information about the true situation in East Timor. PELITA is 
confident that they will acknowledge that what East Timor has 
achieved is the best in the course of its history if they 
understand the true situation in the province. 
  KOMPAS offers a similar comment. The petition of the New 
Zealand deputies arose from inaccurate information or was 
influenced by the controversial film "Death of A Nation." 
According to KOMPAS, it would be good if a proposal for 
exchanging parliamentary visits is implemented. The New Zealand 
deputies will thus be able to make a fair judgment of the 
situation in East Timor after seeing the province by themselves. 
KOMPAS is confident that Bolger's visit is intended to enhance 
the friendship between the two nations -- a friendship based on 
an understanding of each other's problems and assistance in the 
time of need.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 16 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Indonesia hopes 
that an international conference on East Timor scheduled to be 
organized in Manila later this month will not go through because 
its aims do not accord with the Philippine Government's 
understanding of the East Timor problem, Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas said here Monday. 
  Alatas made the statement at a press conference following a 
meeting with Philippine President Fidel Ramos' special envoy, 
Raul Manglapus, who had come to Jakarta to explain Manila's 
position towards the privately sponsored conference. 
  "We still believe there is a way to solve the issue," Alatas 
said. 
  He said although the Philippine Government's commitment to 
its national constitution and freedom of speech was 
understandable, Indonesia was disappointed that the conference 
would still take place. 
  He said in Indonesia's view the planned conference was not 
an 
academic exercise nor an event to promote democracy. Neither 
would it be discussing human rights in the Asia-Pacific region 
in general as its organizers had at the beginning claimed. 
  "It is certainly a political campaign against Indonesia," he 
stressed. 
  "The name of the conference is Asia-Pacific Conference on 
East Timor. How could they (the organizers) say that it will 
deal with human rights or democratization in the region," he 
said. 
  Alatas said Indonesia was suspecting that Ramos Horta, 
Cecillia Jimenez, and Renato Constantino -- diehard opponents to 
East Timor's integration with Indonesia -- were behind the 
planned conference. 
  "Claiming to be representing some obscure non-governmental 
organizations, they are trying to make the East Timor issue an 
Asia- Pacific concern," he said. 
  Alatas warned that both Indonesia's and the Philippines' 
national interests would be affected if the conference went on 
as scheduled by its sponsors. 
  Previously, Raul Manglapus had said it was difficult for the 
Philippine Government to prevent the conference from being held. 
  "The conference is scheduled to be held in one of the 
universities in Manila. Some universities in my country have a 
certain autonomy and that's why it is difficult for us to 
prevent them from staging any academic event," he added. 
  He said the Philippine Government fully supported 
Indonesia's 
effort to protect its territorial integrity. 
  "Moreover, we have long-standing bilateral ties and live in 
the spirit of ASEAN," he said. 
  He said the Philippine Government was determined to take any 
step necessary to prevent the conference from causing any damage 
to its ties with Indonesia. 
  When asked whether or not he would visit Indonesia again if 
his government failed to prevent the holding of the conference, 
Manglapus said: "It depends on how angry your country is." 
  "But I am hopeful that after this meeting there will be 
understanding on both sides. And, at least, the Philippine 
Government will do its best to prevent any damage (to the ties 
between the two countries)," said the former Philippines foreign 
minister.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Again, The Worker Problem"] </F>
  [Text] President Suharto's call the other day for higher 
industrial wages may sound like music to many laborer's ears. 
"The wage system should not widen the social gap," the President 
said in seminar, jointly organized by the Ministry of Manpower 
and the International Labor Organization. 
  Suharto cautiously added that wages should not rise so high 
as to damage the competitiveness of the Indonesian economy, 
which benefits from cheap labor. 
  The question is, will or can the President's call be 
realized 
and enforced in the near future? Given the many experiences in 
the past in which many laws remain unenforced, it is 
understandable enough if one is doubtful that the fate of our 
workers will drastically change for the better soon. 
  Even after the Medan incident last month in which widespread 
labor protests turned into anti-Chinese rioting, one should not 
expect any immediate change for our worker's lives. Yes, now 
all parties involved have pledged to improve the welfare of our 
workers. But, we can see that as long as the government's basic 
perception of the labor problem prevails, it will hamper a 
speedy cure of the existing ills. 
  Many of us are inclined to believe that low wages and unfair 
treatment of workers are the main factors which have triggered 
most of the current labor disputes. But, suppose that these two 
factors have been improved is there any guarantee that it will 
cure our labor problems? Frankly, we doubt it. 
  For one thing, labor is perhaps the most neglected sector in 
our development program. We can boast of our successes in 
development, citing impressive statistics. Yet, what is the 
position of our workers at this stage? Have they received the 
slice of our development pie that rightly belongs to them? 
  We are afraid the answer is "No." The source of the evil is, 
perhaps, our traumatic experience with the communist-dominated 
labor movement prior to he abortive communist coup of 1965, 
which apparently continues to haunt many of our officials and 
causes the government to follow policy which strictly controls 
the labor movement and gives low priority to the education of 
the labor force. 
  Coupled with the government industrialization policy, which 
inclined to side with the employer, the result is a disaster for 
our workers. For more than 20 years there has practically been 
no serious, comprehensive policy to tackle our labor problems. 
  The figures speak for themselves. According to 1990 data, 
more than 76 percent of our workforce is comprised of people 
with only elementary school educations. About 39 percent of our 
unemployed, a staggering 38 percent of the population, are 
elementary or secondary school graduates. 
  No wonder the majority of our workers belong to the lowest 
strata of our society. Poorly educated and lacking in training, 
most of them are helpless and have no bargaining power in 
dealing with their employers. Aside from that, most of them are 
ignorant of their rights, since organized labor is seen as 
something undesirable. 
  Thus, if we really and sincerely want to upgrade our 
workers, 
certain measures should be taken immediately. The first and the 
most important thing is to change our perception of labor. Our 
laborers should not be eyed suspiciously as a possible political 
force, or for their potential as troublemakers. They are part 
of our national assets and will always remain so. Certainly 
they should get their share of the development pie. 
  More vocational training schools should be opened. Top 
priority should be given to offering workers a chance to improve 
their skills. Labor laws should be fairly enforced. And of 
course the worker should also not be denied his rights, 
including their constitutional right of association. Everybody 
knows that without association, the workers are powerless. 
  In short, if we start from the premise that our workers are 
our partners in development, then surely they deserve to be 
treated fairly and humanely and given their due. We believe 
that in the end such a humane approach will benefit not only our 
workers, but also their employers. And certainly this, in turn, 
will serve to boost our national development efforts, which aim 
to build a just and prosperous society for all Indonesians.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Foreign investment commitments 
approved by the government during the March 16-April 15 period 
dropped by 83.2 percent to US$411.66 million from $2.46 billion 
in the February 16-March 15 period. 
  The Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) said in its latest 
monthly report that domestic investment commitments approved in 
the March-April period also fell. The drop, less sharp than for 
foreign investment, was 55.7 percent to Rp [rupiah] 3.08 
trillion ($1.44 billion) from Rp 5.52 trillion in the previous 
month. 
  The report explained that the foreign investments approved 
in 
the March-April period were committed for 30 new projects worth 
$300.25 million and 14 expansion projects worth $111.40 million 
while the domestic investments were planned for the 
establishment of 44 new projects valued at Rp 2.27 trillion and 
13 expansion projects valued at Rp 809.36 billion. 
  In comparison, during the February-March period the board 
approved 18 new foreign projects worth $384.97 million, 21 
foreign expansion projects worth $2.08 billion 74 new domestic 
projects worth Rp 3.98 trillion and 31 domestic expansion 
projects valued at Rp 1.53 trillion. 
  The report showed that the largest foreign investment 
commitment was made by PT [Limited Company] Abadi Joyo 
Iron-Steel Corporation, which will invest $70.59 million for an 
iron plant in South Sulawesi. 
  The other new foreign projects include: 
  --A $21.41 million integrated Arabica-coffee plantation 
and processing project owned by PT Genap Mupakat in Aceh, 
northern Sumatera. 
  --A $21 million lamp-manufacturing factory in East Java 
owned by PT GE Angkasa Lighting. 
  The foreign expansion projects include: 
  --A $38.52 million consumer and household-electronics 
plant owned by PT National Gobel in East Java. 
  --A $34 million electric component and isolator plant 
owned by PT Scheider Indonesia in East and West Java. 
  The new domestic investments include: 
  --A Rp 517.15 billion integrated oil palm plantation and 
crude palm oil (CPO) processing project owned by PT Varita 
Majutama in Irian Jaya. 
  --A Rp 249.96 billion real estate and golf course complex 
owned by PT Adhibaladika in East Java. 
  --A Rp 166.95 billion medium density fiberboard (MDF) 
plant owned by PT Megarimba Karyatama in Lampung, southern 
Sumatera. 
  -- A Rp 58.82 billion integrated oil palm plantation and 
CPO processing project owned by PT Pembangunan Khatulistiwa 
Belian Jaya in West Kalimantan. 
  -- A Rp 45.50 billion steel-casting plant owned by PT 
Citra Industri Logam Mesin Persada in West Java. 
  The domestic expansion projects include: 
  -- A Rp 220 billion integrated shrimp hatchery and cold 
storage project owned by PT Suri Tani Pemuka in South Kalimantan. 
  -- A Rp 200 billion cement-based industry and general 
mining contractor services owned by PT Trumik Beton in West 
Java, with operations covering Indonesia. 
  -- A Rp 170 billion industrial paper plant owned by PT 
Papyrus Sakti in West Java. 
  The report also specified that the licenses for three 
domestic projects have been canceled. The licenses were 
originally committed for the establishment of a rattan furniture 
factory in Central Sulawesi, a hotel in Bali and an industrial 
estate in East Java. 
  BKPM said that during the first 3.5 months of this year, it 
cumulatively approved 95 new foreign projects, which reflected a 
58.3 percent increase from the 60 projects during the same 
period of last year. However, in terms of value, the 
investments to be involved in the projects increased by just 0.1 
percent to $3.118 billion from $3.114 billion. 
  During the January l-April 15 period, BKPM approved 229 new 
domestic investment projects worth Rp 17.84 trillion.

    [Editorial Report] The 20 April Jakarta ANGKATAN BERSENJATA 
in Indonesian on page 5 reported that the Philippines is 
interested in purchasing excess F-5 fighter jets and ships from 
South Korea as part of its efforts to modernize its military 
equipment, according to Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, the 
newly-appointed military chief. South Korea sold 12 patrol 
boats the Philippines at a sharply-reduced price last year, and 
was considering selling F-5 jets as well. This sale, however, 
must be approved by the U.S., since Korea acquired the jets 
through the U.S. military assistance program. Enrile pointed 
out that the Philippines is relying on only two 1960-vintage F-5 
jets to guard its airspace. The problem became very apparent 
when U.S. forces withdrew from the country in 1992.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by President Fidel Ramos on former Foreign </F>
Affairs Secretary Raul Manglapus' mission to Indonesia; place 
and date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] With respect to the scheduled meeting sponsored by 
some private groups on the situation in East Timor, I have sent 
a mission to Indonesia to convey a message from me to President 
Suharto. The mission will also call on Mr. Ali Alatas, the 
Indonesian foreign minister. 
  The mission which left for Jakarta early on Monday is headed 
by former Secretary of Foreign Affairs Raul Manglapus, with 
retired Major General Jose Magno and Undersecretary for Foreign 
Affairs Rodolfo Severino as members. 
  The mission will reaffirm the Philippines' solidarity with 
Indonesia as a close friend and neighbor, and as partners in 
ASEAN, specifically, to reiterate the Philippine commitment to 
the support for the territorial integrity of the Republic of 
Indonesia including the province of East Timor. 
  The Philippines has affirmed this commitment and the support 
openly in [pause] last 19 years in the United Nations and in 
other forum. 
  The Manglapus mission will also take, [changes thought] make 
clear that the Philippine Government dissociates itself from the 
conference on East Timor, that it looks for with disfavor upon 
the use of Philippine territory to question the territorial 
integrity of a friendly neighbor, and that it disagrees with 
their premises on which the conference is being conveyed. 
  It will explain why, under the Philippine Constitution, it 
is 
possible for the Philippine Government to stop a gathering of 
private Filipino individuals from taking place. At the same 
time, the mission will assure the Indonesian Government of the 
Philippine Government's disavowal of this particular conference 
and of continuing Philippine solidarity with Indonesia on the 
question of East Timor. The Philippine Government has already 
stated this position before and will continue to manifest it 
strongly and in various ways. 
  The Philippines highly values its relationship with 
Indonesia 
which has been steadfast in its friendship with the Philippines. 
  I hope that all concerned will avoid doing anything that 
will 
damage the mutually beneficial relations between our two 
countries.

  [Text] Indonesia is postponing indefinitely the second 
round of peace talks between the Philippine Government and the 
Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] representatives scheduled 
to start today until 23 May in Jakarta. Former Ambassador 
Manuel Yan, presidential peace adviser, confirmed the delay 
which is the second since the peace talks were first scheduled 
last mid-April. 
  According to Yan, Indonesia postponed the meeting due to a 
number of international commitments. Ambassador Yan denied 
speculations that the postponement was in reaction to the 
Philippines' hosting of a human rights conference here on East 
Timor which Indonesia views with disfavor.

  [Text] Senate President Edgardo Angara, Speaker Jose de 
Venecia Jr., House Majority Leader Ronaldo Zamora, and all 
Cabinet members except Health Secretary Juan Flavier are now 
being tried by the people's court of the armed group Alex 
Boncayao Brigade (ABB). 
  Sergio Ramirez, spokesman of the ABB which claimed the 
Saturday gunslaying of Chief Inspector Timoteo Zarcal yesterday 
said Angara and De Venecia are being tried for their alleged 
involvement in the acquisition of behest loans and for 
"enriching themselves at the expense of the masses." 
  Without giving details, Ramirez said the Cabinet men, except 
Flavier who is pro-people, are being tried for "sins against the 
masses." 
  The other day, Filemon Lagman aka Carlos Forte, chairman of 
the breakaway group Manila-Rizal Committee, said his group is 
targeting De Venecia, Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim, Presidential 
Legal Adviser Antonio Carpio, and Senior Supt. [Superintendent] 
Romeo B. Maganto, WPDC [Western Police District Command] deputy 
director for administration. 
  He said Pring was also targeted but he proved to be a 
"slippery target." 
  He also said the ABB is pursuing a public relations campaign 
by ridding the metropolis of criminals, a task the government 
has failed to accomplish. 
  Reacting to Ramirez' statements, Angara said: "I welcome the 
investigation. Wala naman tayong ginawa na masama sa 
taongbayan. Sana'y tapusin lang nila kaagad [I have not done 
anything wrong to the people. Hopefully, they'll conclude it as 
soon as possible.]" 
  He expressed confidence that an inquiry, if it will be on 
allegations that he benefited from the grant of behest loans to 
the Batong Buhay [Live Stone] Gold Mines, will finally clear him 
of the charges. He reiterated that as nominal director of the 
firm, he did not participate in decision-making in the company. 
  De Venecia Jr. refused to believe he was in the ABB hit 
list. 
  He quoted Carpio as saying his (De Venecia's) name was 
included in the supposed ABB hit list by "political enemies." 
He refused to identify the "enemies." 
  "This is just black propaganda. They're making it legitimate 
through you guys," De Venecia told reporters. 
  Maganto belittled the threat saying, "Matagal na `yan. Di na 
`ko nagre-react diyan [It has been there for so long. I don't 
react to it anymore]," he said. 
  President Ramos said police reports dispute the ABB's claim. 
  "The police progress reports indicate that it is not 
necessarily that the ABB did the killing. That is not the 
conclusion on the part of the police. They are looking at other 
angles," the president said in his weekly conference. 
  He also belittled the ABB's continuing threat to kill 
officials. 
  "This is not new. They have been making all kinds of threats 
in the past and they have always wanted to disrupt our society 
and the well-being and peace of mind of our people." 
  Senior Supt. Hermogenes E. Ebdane Jr., director of the 
Western Police District Command, said probers are not "buying 
hook, line, and sinker" the ABB claim. 
  "We are pursuing all angles in our ongoing investigation. We 
will come out with a statement after we have gathered sufficient 
evidence," he said. 
  Ebdane also said the WPDC will honor Zarcal during his 
burial 
next week. Despite Zarcal's dismissal from the police force, 
the WPDC still considers him a policeman, Ebdane said. Zarcal 
is an organic member of WPDC. 
  The Western Police District Command released cartographic 
sketches of two of six suspects in the Zarcal murder. 
  One of them is 24 to 26 years old, 5'6" to 5'7" tall, of 
medium build, and dark complexion. He hit Zarcal in the left 
temple. 
  The second is 25 to 30 years old, 5'4" to 5'5" tall, of 
medium build, and brown complexion. He monitored Zarcal's 
movements prior to the attack. 
  Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon appealed to the ABB to 
stop 
summary execution of government officials allegedly involved in 
corrupt and nefarious activities. While there are defects in 
the country's justice system, Drilon said, no group should take 
the law into its hands. 
  Steps are being taken by government to correct defects in 
the 
criminal system and strengthen the rule of law," Drilon added.

  [Text] The country's trade gap widened to $1.663 billion in 
the first three months from $1.280 billion in the same period 
last year, according to the latest data from the National 
Statistics Office (NSO). 
  The uptick is roughly equivalent to a 30 percent growth. 
  As before, imports continued to outperform exports. The 
import bill grew by 21.9 percent to hit $4.579 billion in March 
from $3.756 billion last year. Exports, on the other hand, grew 
by just 17.8 percent in the period. The country's export 
receipts rang up a meager $2.916 billion in the first quarter. 
  However, exports are starting to show indications of 
catching 
up. For March alone, export earnings rose by 24.7 percent to 
$1.05 billion, from $842 million the same month a year ago. 
Import bills in the same period grew by only 14 percent (to 
$1.586 billion). 
  Month on month, though, imports still outpaced exports. From 
February to March, imports grew by 17.7 percent as against 
exports which grew by 14.4 percent. 
  Of the March imports, electronics and components for the 
manufacture of semiconductors topped the list. Imports 
expenditures reached $186.19 million -- or 10.5 percent higher 
than last year's figures -- but declined by 11.9 percent from 
the previous month. Electronics and components have together 
been the country's number one import for the third consecutive 
month. 
  Power-generating and specialized machinery also took a huge 
chunk of the bill. Expenditures on the product amounted to 
$176.36 million, or up 10.5 percent from last year. Spending on 
capital equipment increased as the government continued to boost 
its energy expansion programs. Power-generating machinery 
topped the list a year ago, but slipped when the country enjoyed 
a breathing spell from power shortage. Imports of the commodity 
fell 11.9 percent from February. 
  Mineral fuels, lubricants, and related materials ranked 
third 
with imports worth $138.19 million. This value reflected a 7.6 
percent decrease from last year's level, and a slight uptick 
from the previous month. 
  Imports of telecommunication equipment and electrical 
machinery followed with bills amounting to $120.02 million, down 
24.5 percent from $158.89 million in the previous year. 
  Transport equipment, the fifth biggest import, registered at 
$105.38 million, after dropping 55 percent from $67.97 million. 
  Other major imports include textile yarn, fabrics, made-up 
articles and related products ($103.04 million); iron and steel 
($77.51 million); paper and paper products ($73.05 million); 
materials and accessories imported on consignment basis for the 
manufacture of other electrical and electronic machinery and 
equipment ($47.41 million); and, plastics and non-primary forms 
($45.03 million). The ten major imports accounted for 67.6 
percent of the total. 
  Japan and the United States remained the major source of 
goods. Shipments from Japan to the Philippines were valued at 
$381 million while shipments from the United States were worth 
$271 million. Imports from the two countries together took up 
41.1 percent of the total import bill.

  [Text] Good news. The country may well be on its way to 
becoming a major oil and gas producer by 1998. 
  Results of the short production tests at the Malampaya-3 
well 
in offshore northwest Palawan flowed at a rate of 5,487 barrels 
of oil per day (BOPD) and 5.05 million standard cubic feet of 
gas per day, the Department of Energy (DoE) said in a report 
yesterday. 
  Dre Boon, Shell Phils. [Philippines] Exploration (SPEX) vice 
president told BUSINESS WORLD yesterday the results are more 
than what they expected. SPEX is the operator of the 
Camago-Malampaya fields in offshore northwest Palawan. 
  "This is very good news. We are very happy about it. This 
is a confirmation of our studies and reports," he said. 
  He explained that the initial tests were done on the oil 
zone 
of the well at about 3,400 meters below the rig. The tests are 
usually done from the bottom which contains the oil deposits and 
then upwards where the gas deposits lie. 
  Another 24-hour test will be done on the oil zone before 
SPEX 
goes up to the gas zone, after which, a full gas test will be 
done. Based on their schedule, the gas test will start next week. 
  Mr. Boon said SPEX will finish its testing on the 
Malampaya-3 
well by the end of the month. Afterwards, SPEX will immediately 
drill its second appraisal well which would be between the 
Malampaya-3 well in the southern part and the Camago-Malampaya 1 
and 2 wells in the northern part. 
  He said there is a distance of about 10 kilometers from the 
north and south parts of the Malampaya fields. 
  Thus, the results of the next drilling will determine if the 
basin from north to south contains oil or gas. Mr. Boon said 
the 5.05 million cubic feet of gas daily flow rate registered in 
the oil zone is just normal and is not a determining factor on 
whether or not there are enough gas deposits to warrant 
commercial production. 
  However, in the upcoming full gas tests, SPEX needs at least 
a flow rate of about 20 million cubic feet of gas per day. 
  At present, SPEX is gathering more information on the 
geology 
of the well to be able to establish the reserves of the whole 
Camago- Malampaya fields. 
  Meanwhile, Alcorn (Production) Phils., operator of the West 
Linapacan fields also in offshore northwest Palawan has set and 
cemented the seven-inch liner at 7,595 feet. 
  The operator is currently preparing to drill out excess 
cement. Then, it will run the cement bond log. 
  Ampolex, Ltd. operator of Villaba-1 well in offshore Leyte 
has drilled to a depth of 4,049 feet. Gas shows predominantly 
methane, propane with traces of butane were recorded. The 
operator is drilling ahead.

  [Excerpt] Thai law enforcers should start looking into the 
allegations of drug trafficking made against Chat Thai MP 
Thanong Siriprichapong, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said 
yesterday. 
  Information provided by US authorities linking Thanong to a 
conspiracy to smuggle 45 tones of marijuana into the United 
States from 1973-87 constituted grounds for an investigation, he 
said. 
  "With or without US urging, it is the duty of Thai law 
eforcement officials to take action. Police have a duty to 
investigate alleged wrongdoers -- no matter who they are," the 
prime minister said. "In the case in question, there are 
adequate grounds for investigation." 
  House Speaker Marut Bunnak yesterday said a Chat Thai 
urgency 
motion asking the House of Representatives to consider taking 
action against Thanong had been put on the agenda. 
  The motion was item 14 on the agenda, but could be brought 
forward if MPs wished. 
  Submitted by Chamnong Phothisaro (Chat Thai-Sisaket), it 
asks 
the House of Representatives to decide what to do about the 
Nakhon Phanom MP, charging that the allegations against him have 
affected the credibility of the House. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] A Chat Thai Party MP has sponsored an urgent 
motion for the Lower House to debate the Thanong Siriprichaphong 
marijuana smuggling case. 
  Deputy House Speaker Thawin Phraison said the motion was 
submitted by Sisaket MP Chamnong Phothisaro and was accepted for 
the House meeting agenda. 
  Whether the motion would be moved up for debate at the Lower 
House's next meeting would depend on the opinion of the majority 
of the Lower House members, Mr Thawin said. 
  Fellow lawmakers said yesterday that Mr Thanong should know 
what course of action to take because he is the one embroiled in 
the scandal. 
  Phalang Tham Party [PTP] founder Chamlong Simuang said as an 
MP, Mr Thanong should know best what step he should take as a 
result of the scandal. 
  Maj. Gen. Chamlong said, however, that in the interests of 
justice and fairness Mr Thanong's position should also be heard. 
  The PTP de facto leader denied that the United States' 
accusation against Thanong was part of a plan by PTP to ruin 
Chart Thai's chance of joining the coalition. He also said that 
was no reason for PTP to try to discredit Chat Thai. 
  "I believe the people know Khun Thanong's problem. MPs are 
grown-up people and they should set themselves up as models for 
others to obtain the public's trust. We all know what Khun 
Thanong should do," Maj. Gen. Chamlong said. 
  Commenting on the issue, Deputy House Speaker Thawin said he 
believed the Nakhon Phanom MP possessed "political spirit" and 
knows what he should do. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday urged ASEAN 
countries to take a unified stand against foreign interference 
in the Cambodian civil war. 
  "ASEAN is in a good position to voice opposition to any 
foreign interference in Cambodia's internal affairs and to 
oppose foreign (arms) assistance to any of the Cambodian 
parties," he said. 
  King Sihanouk said last week that foreign military 
assistance 
to the Cambodian government might be the only way to end the war 
with the Khmer Rouge. 
  An Australian government official said in Canberra on Friday 
that the Phnom Penh government had approached Australia, the 
United States, France and "some ASEAN countries" for weapons. 
  The six-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) 
comprises Thailand, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines 
and Singapore. Thailand has repeatedly warned against outside 
interference in Cambodia's affairs. 
  Chuan reiterated yesterday that his government preferred a 
nonmilitary solution to the conflict. The seemingly endless war 
would only be fuelled further by fresh supplies of weapons, and 
this would have a direct affect on Thailand, he added. However, 
the prime minister opined it was the Cambodian government's 
"sovereign right to ask for a foreign arms supply". 
  Thailand, smarting under allegations it denies that it still 
supports the Khmer Rouge, has been unsuccessful in previous 
attempts to convince its ASEAN partners of the need for a 
unified stand against foreign interference in Cambodia. 
  Despite well-earned world praise for ASEAN's earlier 
cohesiveness in policies towards Cambodia, a meeting of senior 
officials from the six nations in Thailand last month could not 
reach a consensus on the situation there. 
  Phnom Penh will be invited as a special guest to the annual 
ASEAN meetings to be held in Bangkok in July, when the situation 
in Cambodia will be a topic of concern. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday urged 
France and Indonesia, as co-chairmen of the Paris Peace 
Conference, to call for consultations among all 19 signatories 
to the Paris peace agreement on the question of foreign arms 
supplies. They include the US, France and Australia. 
  "The issue now is that even Western arms suppliers have no 
consensus on whether to supply arms to Cambodia," Surin told 
reporters upon his return from Saudi Arabia.

  [Text] National Security Council [NSC] chief Gen Charan 
Kunlawanit strongly opposes any foreign assistance to the 
Cambodian army, and has warned that military aid will only 
prolong the war in Cambodia. 
  An informed government source said Charan made his views 
known during a visit by the Australian secretary for foreign 
affairs about two weeks ago. The source quoted Charan as saying 
that providing arms is not the best way to achieve a lasting 
peace in Cambodia. 
  Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk recently called for foreign 
military aid, saying it was the only way the end the war with 
the Khmer Rouge, and named Australia, France and the United 
States as likely providers. 
  Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said yesterday that 
Canberra considered it "wholly legitimate, and consistent with 
the Paris Peace Accords, for the Cambodian government to seek 
such assistance from the international community in order to 
maintain the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity". 
  He said Australia is considering Cambodia's request for 
weapons but will consult and take into account the views of 
other interested countries, including Thailand. 
  Charan also expressed concern that the poorly-paid and 
ill-disciplined Cambodian troops will eventually sell off the 
foreign arms. 
  Sarot Chawanawirat, deputy permanent secretary for foreign 
affairs, said the Cambodian government was entitled to seek 
help, but Thailand believed that providing arms to Cambodia 
would only prolong the fighting there.

<F P=106> ["Special Report": "Price of Peace in Cambodia"] </F>
  [Text] King Sihanouk, disappointed with a lack of progress 
in his attempt to hold dialogue for national reconciliation, 
said in a news conference yesterday that he was sorry that the 
conduct of the leaders of the Cambodian factions was not worthy 
of the $3,000 million the world gave to the United Nations to 
forge an end to the armed dispute and to hold general elections 
last year. The king blamed continued disputes among the 
Cambodian factions as the main cause of the political problem in 
his country. 
  The $3 billion UN administration of Cambodia during the 
transition period leading to the election was not just the most 
expensive UN operation, it achieved only partial success. That 
is, while the United Nations succeeded in organizing the 
election and formation of government of the people, it failed to 
achieved peace and national reconciliation, which were just as 
important. To date, no one can tell how much more investment 
will be needed to achieve the complete goal as desired by the 
United Nations. 
  It is strange that while so far there is no answer to the 
question of how much more the world has to pay to enable the 
Cambodian people to avoid genocide, certain countries have 
openly said that they are ready to make more investment by 
sending in their soldiers or providing arms to the Cambodians. 
This would only exacerbate the fighting in that country. It 
appears as if the world has put a cap on its budget for peace in 
Cambodia and has begun to contemplate a budget for war and 
destruction. As long as the Cambodian factions continue their 
disputes, the trend for more intense fighting could gain greater 
support from other Western countries. If the Cambodian leaders 
agree to the strange proposal advanced by the west, peace will 
likely be achieved only by extermination of the Cambodian race.

  [Text] The Phnom Penh government should end confusion and 
announce which Cambodian factions are officially outlawed, Army 
Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit said yesterday. 
  "An announcement would make it clear who is who in the 
country, as different people have different understandings. 
Some may have incorrect assumptions," Gen Wimon said. 
  He also reiterated his belief that supplying weapons to the 
Cambodian government would only prolong the civil war there and 
warned that Thailand would be seriously affected. 
  The general was responding to reports that Australia and 
United States are considering a request by King Norodom Sihanouk 
for fresh military aid to save his war-ravaged country "from the 
yoke of the Khmer Rouge". 
  Australian officials said last week that Canberra, 
Washington, Paris and some Asian countries were discussing how 
to bolster Phnom Penh's ill-disciplined and poorly-equipped 
military, but no decision had been made. 
  France is co-chairman of the Paris Peace Conference, which 
set up the peace accords. Indonesia is the other chairman. 
  "Thailand would be seriously affected as the weapons 
supplied 
to Cambodia would be put on sale along the Thai border by ill- 
disciplined Cambodian government troops in need of money because 
their pay is so low," Wimon said. 
  He warned that his patience with Cambodia was running out. 
  "Thailand has never intervened in Cambodia's domestic 
affairs 
and will not do so. It is their own business if they want to 
kill one another. But I will not continue to be patient if 
Thais are affected, as I am also Thai. 
  "What Cambodia needs is humanitarian assistance for its 
people, which would help bring lasting peace to the country and 
the region." 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri has also warned that 
providing weapons would only prolong the fighting in Cambodia, 
not bring about a peaceful settlement. 
  Other senior Thai officials are also clearly opposed to any 
military assistance for Phnom Penh's forces. 
  Deputy Defence Minister Maj Gen Sombat Rotphothong and First 
Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo said in separate 
interviews that Australia had a right to provide weapons if 
requested by the Cambodian government, but that Canberra should 
consult Thailand before making a decision. 
  "Canberra should ask for Thailand's opinions on the 
provision 
of weapons to Phnom Penh," Sombat said without further 
elaboration. Chettha said consultation was necessary because 
Thailand was Cambodia's immediate neighbour. 
  Gen Wimon said: "If some kind of assistance can bring 
lasting 
peace to Cambodia it would be really appreciated by other 
countries, as a peaceful situation attracts investment." 
  However, if Australia gave military assistance to Cambodia 
it 
would destroy the existing "peace". The peace-building process 
there could not be achieved through military support.

  [Text] Chiang Mai -- The Third Army has reinforced the 
northern border with Burma's Shan State to ensure fighting 
between the Burmese army and the Mong Tai Army of opium warlord 
Khun Sa does not spill over into Thailand. Border security 
sources said local border patrol police, the military's special 
327 unit and paramilitary troops have been put on alert. 
  The sources said the fighting was about 40 km from the 
border 
and so far was not intense. Thais living in the frontier area 
had not been affected. The wounded from both sides were being 
sent to Thailand for medical treatment, but were being sent back 
once they recovered, according to the source. 
  Khun Sa's army and the government forces have been fighting 
over mountainous areas near Mong Chot in southern Shan State 
since Wednesday. 
  Mong Chot is a strategic Burmese border town about 30 km 
from 
the Thai village of Ban Piang Luang, in the Wiang Haeng district 
of Chiang Mai. 
  Khun Sa's spokesman, Khunsai Jaiyene, said the MTA had 
captured 13 Burmese outposts on three hills surrounding Mong 
Chot, and was advancing toward the town. He hoped the 
guerrillas would seize the Burmese stronghold at Doi Pok Hom 
within the next two days. He said they had already surrounded 
the area. 
  About 500 troops of the MTA 52nd Battalion, led by Maj Saeng 
Som, were used in the attack against about 700 Burmese 
defenders, he added. He said the Burmese had lost 25 men, while 
the MTA suffered 18 dead and 45 wounded. 
  Khun Sa's forces had also taken five soldiers and two 
porters 
captive. The border sources said the ethnic Wa had recently 
sent about 500 troops to assist the Burmese 519th Battalion, 
which is stationed near Mong Chot. The MTA has also sent 
reinforcements. The sources predicted the fighting would soon 
intensify.

  [Text] Thailand, Laos, and China will set up a committee 
to study the construction of highways from Chiang Rai Province 
through Laos to China's border in Yunnan Province, Deputy 
Communications Minister Charat Phuachuai disclosed after holding 
talks with Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang. 
  Charat said that a tripartite committee including highways 
authorities in Thailand, Laos, and China will be set up soon to 
study the project. 
  The Asian Development Bank held a meeting two weeks ago to 
survey the road route through Laos. The study will be completed 
in September. Charat said that the committee will help the 
Asian Development Bank to summarize the survey faster. 
  Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang said he is interested in jointly 
building a road from Thailand into Xishuangbanna. The governor 
said that there are two possible routes. One is from Chiang 
Khong of Chiang Rai Province in Thailand through Bokeo Province, 
Luang Namtha Province, and Boten district in Laos to the border 
of China. Another one is from Mae Sai of Chiang Rai Province 
through Tachilek, Kengtung in Burma to Daluo in China. 
  Deputy Communications Minister Charat said that Thailand is 
more interested in the route through Laos because Thailand just 
signed a memorandum of understanding with Laos last week 
agreeing to support Lao transport and communications business. 
He also said that the second route through Burma is not so safe 
because it would face problems with Burmese minorities. 
  Regarding waterway transport along the Mekong River from 
Chiang Rai to Xishuangbanna, the Thai deputy communications 
minister said that the Thai Government has approved the 
construction of permanent piers at Chiang Khong and Chiang Saen 
to be international customs posts. The government will provide 
20 million baht for each pier.

  [Text] The air transport tax exemption agreement between 
Thailand and Saudi Arabia will foster relations and cooperation 
in tourism, trade, investment and exports between the two 
countries, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan said 
yesterday. 
  The signing ceremony for the Agreement for Reciprocal 
Exemption of Taxes on the Activities of Air Transport 
Enterprises took place last Tuesday in Jeddah by Mr Surin and 
Saudi Deputy Minister of Finance and Economics Dr Abdulaziz al 
Nasrullah. 
  "According to the Revenue and Aviation departments, the 
agreement would help reduce people's travelling expenses by 10 
per cent and promote air transport and travel," Mr Surin said 
upon his return from Jeddah. 
  The deputy foreign minister left Bangkok on May 9 for Jeddah 
as chief of Thai pilgrims to Mecca for the annual Haj rites. He 
is scheduled to leave for Saudi Arabia again on Wednesday. 
  The agreement was the first between the governments of 
Thailand and Saudi Arabia in the last five years, he said.

  [Text] Phrae -- His Excellency Bounkeut Sangsomsak, the 
ambassador of the Lao People's Democratic Republic to Thailand, 
told reporters that it is the policy of the Lao Government to 
give its full support to the quadrangle economic development 
program, adding that the Lao Government is always aware of the 
fact that the complete implementation of this four-nation 
cooperation scheme will greatly benefit Laos in terms of 
tourism, industrial development, and international trade. 
  He noted that the Provinces of Luang Namtha, Bokeo, 
Sayaboury, and Oudomsai will directly reap the fruits of the 
program. 
  The ambassador, however, pointed out that the Lao Government 
has no intention to pin all its hopes on the development scheme, 
because it realizes that a program of such a magnitude will 
require a prior careful feasibility study. As a result of the 
technical meetings, one held in Bangkok and the rest in the 
Philippines, the four countries involved have agreed that the 
private sectors should be allowed to play the leading role, and, 
as everyone knows, he said, the private sectors have their 
limits in carrying out working projects. 
  Since the feasibility study for the quadrangle economic 
development program will be very time consuming, the Lao 
Government has decided to implement its own development plan for 
the northern part of the country. Under this plan, the 
government will first estimate the total expense of the plan and 
seek loans from foreign countries to finance all construction 
projects, which will be carried out by both Thai and Lao 
contractors through bidding. 
  His Excellency Bunkeut said that the Lao Government cannot 
depend solely on the quadrangle economic development program, 
because each participating country has its own objectives to 
pursue. For example, Thailand is interested in trade and 
tourism, while Laos looks forward to industrial development, and 
China sets its target on both tourism and industries. Under the 
quadrangle scheme, laws on import and export control and 
immigration legislations of the four countries must be realigned 
into the same direction to ensure good coordination. It will be 
a long time before they can achieve that.

  [Text] The Thai Navy detained a Vietnamese boat named 
"TD-008" with 14 crewmen and a number of weapons in Thai 
territorial waters on 7 February while the boat was chasing Thai 
fishing trawlers. It was charged with an act of terrorism and a 
violation of international and Thai laws. Later on, Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai and his delegation visited the SRV 
between 16-19 March at the invitation of the Vietnamese prime 
minister. During their meeting on 17 March, the foreign 
ministers of the two countries discussed the issue of the 
release of the fishermen, proposing an exchange for Thai 
fishermen held in Vietnam. Vietnam offered to release Thai 
fishermen held in Vietnam as soon as possible and to consider 
releasing 16 Thai prisoners held for trying to escape prisons 
and for killing people in Can Tho Province, provided that the 
relatives of those prisoners agreed to pay a fine of U.S. 
$20,000 as judged by the court. At the same time, Vietnam 
asked Thailand to release the 14 Vietnamese crewmen held by the 
Thai Navy. Subsequently, the Thai prime minister agreed to 
release the 14 Vietnamese to promote good relations with Vietnam 
and to create a good atmopshere for future talks with Vietnam on 
other issues.

  [Text] Nineteen Muslim organizations have claimed that 
violence in the South was a consequence of the May 1992 turmoil, 
and not the work of separatists, according to a news bulletin. 
  The SAN EKKAPHAP (Solidarity News Bulletin), published by 
southern Muslim MPs, said the organizations believed the 
violence was not created by separatist guerrillas. The violence 
occurred as a result of the May upheavals which culminated in 
the violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations. 
  The organizations claimed the government had information 
relevant to the violence. It should reveal the facts in a 
straightforward manner, and improve its working system to 
prevent the situation from deteriorating. 
  "The government has to shoulder responsibility for the 
violent incidents. The government must take decisive action to 
prevent the situation from turning into bloodshed," they said. 
  The organizations said social and political problems had 
affected the South's economy. They claimed the South had lost 
BtlO billion in economic gains in the past year. 
  The bulletin is published by the Solidarity Muslim group of 
Muslim MPs from the five southernmost provinces, led by Deputy 
Interior Minister Den Tomina. 
  Den, a Pattani MP, said in the first issue of the bulletin 
that the publication was aimed at protecting Muslim interests 
and creating better understanding between Muslims and Buddhists. 
  Education Minister Samphan Thongsamak told reporters that 
the 
four Muslims accused of involvement in bomb attacks in the South 
are not preachers but teachers of religion. 
  The four suspects, who were granted bail on Tuesday, have 
been charged with sedition. Muslims have claimed the men were 
scapegoats, and it was speculated that they would rally to 
protest the arrests. 
  However, many senior police officers, including national 
police chief Prathin Santipraphop, have repeated several times 
they have substantive evidence to prove the men guilty. 
  Samphan said individuals suspected of committing crimes 
would 
be prosecuted in accordance with the law, regardless of their 
religion. 
  "It is not that if you are a Muslim, you will not be 
punished 
when you do wrong," he said. 
  Politicians should not intervene in the case because they 
could not change the truth. Police should not be disheartened 
and should proceed according to the law, Samphan said. 
  Some Muslim MPs of the New Aspiration Party, also claiming 
the men were scapegoats, have said they would represent them in 
court. 
  In Songkhla, Police Director General Prathin yesterday said 
police had sufficient evidence to take legal action. The 
suspects had the right to ask that new investigators be 
appointed, but he would have the final say. 
  Assistant police chief Michai Nukunkit said investigators 
would file suits against the suspects next week. Army Commander 
in Chief Wimon Wongwanit said crime suspects must be prosecuted 
with an even hand, regardless of their religion.

  [Text] Law enforcement agencies and financial supervisory 
authorities unanimously support money laundering legislation now 
being drafted by a government committee, Deputy Prime Minister 
Amnuai Wirawan said yesterday. 
  Amnuai said he had ordered the government panel in charge of 
drawing up new laws, in cooperation with Chulalongkon 
University's Faculty of Law, to study money laundering laws 
already in use in other countries. 
  "We have discussed the matter and all government agencies 
have given their full support," Amnuai said. "I have also 
raised the issue with the Bank of Thailand. There should be no 
problem (in introducing the law)." 
  Amnuai, who oversees the Office of the Narcotics Control 
Board (ONCB), said he was advised by the anti-drug agency that 
such a law would make it difficult for drug traffickers to 
convert their proceeds into legal currencies and assets. 
  "The measures against money laundering are a good thing. And 
it would not hurt law-abiding citizens either," Amnuai said. "No 
private individual's rights will be compromised." 
  He sought to allay fears expressed by some members of the 
banking community and politicians that a money laundering law 
would turn away foreign investors and shoot down Thailand's 
aspiration to become a financial hub in Southeast Asia. 
  "I don't think a money laundering law, if introduced, would 
affect local or foreign investors. And there is no question 
about whether commercial banks would cooperate with the 
government on the matter. All we need is appropriate guidelines 
and procedures. 
  Amnuai said a money laundering law would require banks to 
report to law enforcement agencies "unusual transactions", 
particularly large cash deposits, by their clients." The 
anti-money laundering measures will seek to control and monitor 
cash transactions. No restrictions will be imposed on the 
issuance of personal cheques which can already be monitored." 
  Senate Speaker Michai Ruchuphan, a legal expert, said a 
money 
laundering law was like a "two-edged sword" because although it 
would be useful as an instrument against drug traffickers and 
other organized crime, it would have a wide-ranging effect on 
all members of the public. 
  "The money laundering law would affect everyone of us. The 
law would require everybody -- no matter who he is or what he 
does -- to identify the source of his money," Michai said. 
  He said the government should carefully consider the 
advantages and drawbacks of such legislation before deciding 
whether to enact it. Among possible drawbacks is abuse of 
authority by government officials who have access to people's 
financial records. 
  Earlier this week, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said he 
approved of the proposal by anti-drug officials to introduce a 
money laundering law provided that it did not infringe upon the 
freedom of the individual. 
  Also yesterday, John Gieve, president of the Group of 
Seven's 
Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) said 
senior Thai government officials he met during a two-day visit 
Thursday and yesterday had expressed support for the proposed 
introduction of a law to combat money laundering. 
  Gieve, also under-secretary of the United Kingdom's 
Treasury, 
met Bank of Thailand Governor Wichit Suphinit on Thursday and 
Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin yesterday, among other 
senior Thai officials. 
  The FATF was established by the Group of Seven Economic 
Summit in 1989 to develop a multilateral response to the threat 
posed by the growth of international money laundering, 
particularly the laundering of drug trafficking proceeds. The 
body now has 26 member countries. 
  FATF member countries in Asia-Pacific include Japan, 
Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia. 
  Dilwyn Griffiths, secretary to the FATF, said although money 
laundering was never an issue in Thailand because the country 
has not made it a criminal offense, there must be some 
laundering activities given the fact that Thailand is a major 
transshipment point for heroin from the Golden Triangle to the 
world market.

<F P=106> ["This report is excerpted from a Bank of Thailand document </F>
presented by Charung Nukhwan, assistant governor of the Bank of 
Thailand to the seminar organized by the Faculty of Law of 
Chulalongkon University in September 1993"] 
  [Excerpts] Money laundering is a process of turning 
illegally- or unscrupulously-earned money into legal currency 
and preventing attempts to prove its illicit origin. Not only 
narcotics traffickers but also criminals have been engaging in 
money laundering activities to purify their money. 
  Money laundering techniques vary from country to country. 
One way to do money laundering is to keep tranferring money 
from one bank or financial institution to another until it is 
difficult to trace the origin of that money. 
  In some cases, the money is first sent to countries where 
laws strictly prohibit financial institutions from revealing the 
identity and personal information of their customers. Later, 
the money will be sent back home. By so doing, authorities will 
find it rather difficult to gather sufficient evidence to take 
any legal action against the owner of the money. 
<H5>  Different Patterns of Money Laundering </H5>
  (1) Illegally-earned money is spent as cash abroad. 
However, carrying a huge amount of cash travelling abroad is 
rather difficult and can trigger official suspicion. Some 
countries impose strict controls on cash transactions while 
financial systems in many countries are not conducive to cash 
transactions. Therefore, cash dealings are practical only in 
countries where regulations are lenient. Cash can also be sent 
out across the borders to other countries with assistance from 
corrupt officials. 
  (2) Depositing the money with financial institutions in the 
country is a common practice. Depositors normally use false 
names in their account books to protect their identities. This 
method is popular in countries where laws do not require the 
disclosure of identities of persons who make transactions or the 
specification of the value of each transaction. This legal 
shortcoming is conducive to using financial institutions to do 
money laundering. 
  (3) Depositing cash with commercial banks and financial 
institutions in other countries where laws on the control of the 
operations of banks and financial institutions are lenient so 
that the money will be included in those countries' monetary 
systems. After that, the money is transferred back to its 
owners, traffickers or criminals, through different means such 
as the wire transfer service. The money is now considered 
clean. This is a weakpoint of the countries which fail to 
enforce the law to strictly control cash outflows. 
  (4) Setting up a business or company is another tactics used 
by traffickers or criminals to conceal the source and ownership 
of their illicit money. They might either set up or purchase a 
company in a tax-free zone abroad. They then have their 
enterprises at home take out a loan or buy goods at exorbitant 
prices from their company in the foreign country so that the 
illegal money can be circulated between the two enterprises. 
  (5) Other methods of money laundering include purchasing 
cash- earning businesses which have been operating at a loss 
such as hotels, foreign exchange ventures, restaurants, retail 
shops, etc. The illicit money then is used to revive these 
businesses. The money is later siphoned out to do something 
else such as buying assignable commercial papers issued by 
financial institutions which assume no responsibility over any 
change of holders of the documents. 
  Moreover, advanced communications technologies in money 
transfer only emphasize quickness. Officials handling the 
transactions have no way of knowing their customers or the 
objectives of the transactions. This is another good 
alternative for money launderers to clean their dirty money. 
<H5>  Prevention And Suppression Of Money Laundering In Foreign </H5>
Countries. 
  FATF, Financial Action Task Force is an interantional 
cooperation program established with U.S. assistance in 1989. 
[passage omitted] 
<H5>  Money Laundering Prevention in Thailand. </H5>
  At present, Thailand is not a member of any international 
organization, nor has it concluded an agreement with any 
countries on money laundering prevention. There is not specific 
law dealing with this problem. Money laundering is not regarded 
as a criminal offense. Financial institutions have no 
particular measures against money laundering except those 
curbing the amount of money in domestic circulation and the 
risks borne by financial institutions in dealing with their 
clients. However, there are several rules and regulations which 
indirectly obstruct money laundering such as the control on cash 
inflow and outflow, the requirement for customers engaging in 
money transaction to reveal their identities, and the retention 
of transaction records. In fact, these are regular pratices of 
commercial banks. 
  Despite the lack of a secrecy law, it is the etiquette of 
financial institutions to keep the identities of their customers 
secret. 
  Suggestions: 
  There are some shortcomings which can obstruct the 
introductioin of a money laundering law. Here are some 
suggestions to overcome the problems. 
  (1) At the initial stage, a law must be promulgated to give 
legal immunity to commercial banks and financial institutions 
which release information about their customers who are 
suspected of doing money laundering. After a period of time, 
commercial banks and financial institutions are required to 
report to the authorities any irregularities, such as the 
transfer of a suspiciously high amount of money so that the 
latter can closely follow it up. 
  (2) Commercial banks and financial institutions must be 
required by law to know their customers in person and be 
prohibited from opening accounts for customers who use fake 
names or refuse to give their real names. Withdrawing or 
depositing huge amounts of cash, for example over 10 million 
baht, would require some written justification, which must be 
keep in the records for a period of time. Suspicious cases must 
be reported to authorities immediately. Commercial banks and 
financial institutions must work out an effective system for 
watching out for and following up any money laundering. 
  (3) A special working unit should be set up to investigate 
monetary offences, confiscate or impound property purchased with 
the money from drug trafficking and other criminal activities, 
and receive information from commercial banks and financial 
institutions for coordination with other agencies concerned. 
This unit can be established independently or under the 
jurisdiction of a ministry. 
  At present, Thailand is in the process of opening its 
financial market and relaxing regulations on the operations of 
financial institutions. New requirements for financial 
institutions in monitoring their customers and reporting to 
authorities can become obstacles to the implementation of the 
said liberal policy. Several countries, such as Singapore, have 
started enforcing this law. Therefore, Thailand can still wait 
to see the result first. 
  Laws and regulations on the control of operation of 
commercial banks and fiancial institutions in Asian countries 
are not much different. The enforcement of the money laundering 
legislation must be carried out step by step to ensure the 
country's maximum interest.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Money Laundering Law Is Needed"] </F>
  [Text] The call for a money laundering prevention law has 
drawn greater attention from the general public following 
following the seizure of the property in the United States of a 
Thai MP who was accused of being involved in marijuana 
trafficking in that country. At present, Thailand has no law 
for the prevention of dirty money laundering, while such a 
legislation has already been enforced in many countries, 
including by our neighbors, such as Singapore. The money 
laundering prevention will enable the authorities to probe into 
the financial status of any suspicious persons to determine the 
sources of their money and related transactions. 
  As a matter of fact, the examination of assets and 
liabilities of suspected individuals is nothing new to Thailand. 
Following the previous coup, the then ruling National 
Peacekeeping Council issued a special order for the examination 
of assets of suspicious politicians. As a result, the people 
were informed of politicians who received gifts of checks and 
individuals who gave such gifts to them. This is another type 
of money laundering law onced enforced in Thailand. But this 
peculiar measure was unacceptable in a democratic society 
because of its discriminatory enforcement. 
  Looked at from another angle, the money laundering law can 
also affect individual rights. However, if too much emphasis is 
placed on personal rights, the whole society can suffer adverse 
consequences. It is imperative that the state place the 
interests of the society over that of individuals. Without this 
law, it is feared that Thailand can become a haven of dirty 
money which is normally earned from narcotics trafficking, the 
contraband goods trade, and other illegal activities. 
  Financial institutions might find it hard to swallow if such 
a law is enforced. Their business and liquidity can be hampered 
should the money of their clients be ordered frozen pending 
official investigation. But they should consider the adverse 
consequences the country has to bear without this law. 
Switzerland was once labelled as one of the places where dirty 
money was deposited. 
  The current situation and present trends in the world and 
society have warranted a money laundering prevention law for 
Thailand. Hence, the authorities will be able to examine the 
money of suspicious individuals. Otherwise, Thailand will 
become a haven of dirty money from law breakers in the country 
as well as from unscrupulous individuals abroad. However, if 
the law makers themselves also have wounds on their backs that 
need covering, it is very likely that such a legislation will 
never be promulgated.

  [Text] Vietnam and Myanmar [Burma] are two countries in 
Southeast Asia which have traditional relations. The late 
President of Vietnam Ho Chi Minh visited Myanmar 35 years ago, 
and that visit was a turning point in the road of mutual 
understanding between the two nations. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit also left a deep 
impression on the Myanmar people. Despite the changing weather, 
thousands of people in their colorful traditional costumes, 
lined up along the road leading to the center of Rangoon to 
welcome Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his party. On the very 
first day of his visit, all newspapers in Myanmar frontpaged 
portrait and biography of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. They also 
carried editorials praising relations between the two countries. 
  Various meetings among state leaders of the two countries 
took place in the atmosphere of mutual understanding. Future 
economic and trade cooperation between Vietnam and Myanmar was 
an important topic at the talks. An agreement on trade was 
signed in 1976, but trade turnover was very modest, mainly in 
exchange of consumer goods and family facilities. Therefore, 
this time both Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his 
Myanmar counterpart Than Shwe expressed the determination to 
further strengthen cooperative relations between the two 
countries. 
  Prime Minister Than Shwe said that he has been following, 
with keen interest, the successful process of renovation in 
Vietnam. He said that there was no obstacle for Myanmar to 
develop its relations with Vietnam. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: Vietnam always attaches 
great importance to the development of more bilateral 
cooperation with Myanmar. An agreement on trade, tourism 
cooperation and the establishment of a joint commission of 
bilateral cooperation was signed during the visit. It is the 
concrete manifestation of the two countries' determination. 
  Myanmar is now in its process of renovation. Hence, Vietnam 
and Myanmar share much in common. The existing fine relations 
between Vietnam and Myanmar and the outcome of the visit by 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet will usher in a new stage of 
relations and cooperation between the two countries. This was 
assessed by the foreign ministers of Vietnam and Myanmar. And 
now the two nations are trying their best to make their 
cooperation more effective and fruitful.

  [Text] HANOI, May 17 (AFP) -- Vietnam has denied any 
territorial ambitions against Cambodia following claims by King 
Norodom Sihanouk that Hanoi was nibbling away at its neighbour 
by slowing moving border markers. 
  "Vietnam has never had ambitions for Cambodia's territory 
and 
always scrupulously implements all agreements signed on border 
and territories between the two countries," a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said. 
  In an interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review King 
Sihanouk accused Vietnam of "moving border markers deeper into 
our territory." 
  "Now the border markers are walking, they are walking 
towards 
the west... they know we cannot take care of two fronts 
simultaneously," the king said, describing the situation as 
"terrible." 
  Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the Khmer 
Rouge 
regime which had launched many attacks across the frontier. 
Hanoi pulled its troops out in 1989 ahead of the implementation 
of a peace plan and elections. 
  Phnom Penh has treated Hanoi's denials of territorial 
ambitions warily as over the last two centuries, Vietnam has 
pushed further into what was once Cambodian territory.

  [Text] There have been many activities in Phnom Penh 
recently which undermined friendly relations between Vietnam and 
Cambodia. Following is our radio comment on these sabotage 
activities. 
  In Phnom Penh recently, people staged a demonstration with 
slogans against Vietnam and the friendly relations between 
Cambodia and Vietnam. Concerning this incident on Monday, a 
spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry made a statement 
saying that Vietnam was very worried at this move aimed to 
undermine traditional friendship between the two countries, and 
to harm Vietnamese nationals living in Cambodia. The statement 
said these acts were beneficial to no one, but created 
instability and encouraged the Khmer Rouge to destroy peace and 
the peaceful life of Cambodians and Vietnamese ethnic nationals 
living there. 
  The main reason for the instability in Cambodia, despite the 
UN- sponsored elections, has been the Khmer Rouge. Together 
with sabotage acts against the national reconstruction of 
Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge has always waged a national campaign 
of hatred and massacre against Vietnamese nationals. Reality 
shows the Khmer Rouge will never stop opposing Vietnam. 
  Nevertheless, Vietnamese people have cherished hopes for 
peace in Cambodia so that the people can build a prosperous 
country. Vietnam places great importance on building and 
developing a neighborly and friendly relationship with the 
Kingdom of Cambodia, on the basis of respecting each other's 
independence, sovereignty, non-intervention in each other's 
internal affairs, and equal cooperation for mutual benefit. 
  The spokesman for the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry further 
said that Vietnam has never coveted Cambodian territory, and has 
always strictly implemented all territorial agreements signed 
between the two countries. For this reason, Vietnam requests 
the Cambodian authorities, as well as authorities in other 
countries, to assure normal life for Vietnamese nationals, like 
other foreign nationals in Cambodia, in conformity with 
international laws and regulations. 
  Vietnam has reaffirmed its good will in relations with 
Cambodia many times, but response to this good will depends on 
Cambodia. The Vietnamese people hope that such acts of sabotage 
to friendly relations between Vietnam and Cambodia will never 
take place again in Cambodia.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 16 -- Concerning the demonstrations by 
some people in Phnom Penh recently with slogan against Vietnam 
and Cambodia-Vietnam friendly relations, a spokesperson for the 
Foreign Ministry today released the following statement: 
  `Vietnam is very worried at some people's acts in Phnom Penh 
in recent days which aimed to undermine the traditional 
friendship between Vietnam and Cambodia, and do harm to the 
Vietnamese nationals in Cambodia. These acts are beneficial to 
nobody but mislead public opinions from seeing what is the real 
cause threatening the stability in Cambodia, and unintendedly 
encourage the Khmer Rouge to destroy peace and the peaceful life 
of the Cambodians as well as the Vietnamese ethnic nations 
there'. 
  The spokesperson stressed that the Vietnamese people have 
cherished a wish that the Cambodian people have peace so that 
they can build a prosperous country and that Vietnam attached 
great importance to the building and developing a close 
neighbourly and friendly relations with the Kingdom of Cambodia 
on the basis of respecting each other's independence,

  [Text] HANOI, May 17 (AFP) -- Vietnam denied Tuesday that 
four monks imprisoned last year following protests in the 
central city of Hue are on hunger strike and are seriously ill. 
  A foreign ministry spokesman dismissed as "totally false" a 
report by the Paris-based International Buddhist Information 
Bureau (IBIB) that the four members of the dissident Unified 
Vietnamese Buddhist Church were on a hunger strike to protest 
their conditions at the Ba Sao re-education camp south of Hanoi. 
  The monks were arrested and charged with "disturbing public 
order" after demonstrations in the former imperial capital of 
Hue last May 24. They were sentenced to prison terms of three 
to four years after a trial in November. 
  In a statement released in Paris, the IBIB called on the 
Vietnamese government to allow representatives of the United 
Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross to 
visit the monks. 
  Hanoi denies oppressing Buddhism, pointing to the repair or 
renovation on nearly all the country's more than 4,000 pagodas 
in the past three years and the increase in the number of monks 
and nuns from 17,000 to more than 20,000. 
  They maintain, however, that all Buddhist "sects" should be 
integrated into the Vietnam Buddhist Church, which was founded 
in 1982 under the umbrella of the Communist Party's Fatherland 
Front. 
  Authorities also refused access to French lawyers who 
applied 
to defend the three monks at their trial and has not allowed 
journalists or human rights groups to visit the re-education 
camp where they are held. 
  The leader of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Church, the 
Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, is also believed by human rights 
groups to be held under house arrest. 
  The foreign ministry spokesman reiterated Hanoi's stance 
that 
the monks were tried legitimately for causing public unrest. 
The protest flared after monks thought police had come to 
arrest the head of the Link Mu pagoda in Hue.

  [Text] The Australian Government has criticized the United 
States over maintaining barriers to trade. The criticism 
follows Washington's annual release in March of its report on 
foreign trade barriers, which targeted Australia for allegedly 
retaining trade barriers. 
  However, as Camille Funnel reports, Australia has responded 
by releasing its own report saying America's trade barriers are 
far tougher than Australia's. 
  [Begin Funnel recording] Australia says it is releasing the 
report to counter an inaccurate and unbalanced impression of 
Australian and U.S. trade policies in an annual American trade 
report. 
  The document says the imbalance of trade between Australia 
and the U.S. is over two to one in favor of Washington and is 
larger proportionally than the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
The report says the fact that a number of major Australian 
exports are subject to stringent import controls has added to 
the growing imbalance in trade. The report cites America's use 
of limits on the imports of beef, sugar, dairy products, and 
steel, as well as other products. 
  The report is critical of the American Government's 
purchasing policy, its taxes on wine and beer, and restrictions 
in a range of services, such as the aviation industry and 
financial services. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Diplomatic Silence May Be Prudent"] </F>
  [Text] The Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan's strong 
attack on the proposed East Asian Economic Caucus [EAEC] is 
unsettling. Not because the EAEC could turn out to be contrary 
to Australian interests. After all, Malaysia's Prime Minister 
Mahathir proposed the EAEC as a regional forum expressly 
excluding the "white" economies of North America, Australia and 
New Zealand (all members of the Australian-initiated 
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation [APEC] group). But over the 
past year, Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator 
Evans, seemed to represent a sensible view that we had little to 
gain by making direct attacks on EAEC, and possibly something to 
lose. 
  Now Senator McMullan says our Government has a "distinct 
preference" that the "EAEC either not go ahead or not get any 
additional significance because we think it would be divisive in 
the region". 
  He also emphasised that even if Australia were allowed to 
join, our Government would still think EAEC wrong in 
"principle". It may have been wiser to wait and see how both 
APEC and EAEC develop, and how the relationship between the two 
grows. 
  The war of words over the two bodies had eased after last 
year's ASEAN meeting in Singapore. A compromise was effected 
whereby Malaysia's EAEC would go ahead, but as a caucus within 
APEC. Australia was assured that the EAEC would not be allowed 
to develop in a divisive manner. 
  At that time Senator Evans implied Australia should moderate 
its public attacks on the EAEC. Moderation had several things 
in its favour. Little would be gained by provoking Dr Mahathir. 
  In any event, it was premature to make judgments about the 
direction of the EAEC. Indeed, since Singapore, there has been 
a strong push within ASEAN and among Australian trade experts, 
including Professor Ross Garnaut, for the EAEC eventually to be 
opened to Australia. 
  Conversely, departing from moderation as Senator McMullan 
has 
done carries risks. Over the past year a view has arisen in 
regional capitals, including Tokyo, that APEC has grown so large 
that it risks losing coherence as a grouping. There has also 
been concern that it could be too subject to American influence. 
  That influence is resented when it is seen to try to impose 
trade quotas on Japan, link China's trade with human rights, and 
Indonesia's with labour rights. The United States is also using 
its influence to try to thwart the EAEC, and the danger for 
Australia in openly attacking that body is that we may be seen 
within the region as a stalking horse for American influence. 
  What Senator McMullan -- and presumably the Government -- 
seems to be forgetting is that Australia's interests in the 
region should be paramount. 
  APEC was an Australian initiative and a diplomatic triumph. 
In the long term it should not matter if Australia's 
self-interest is also served by a non-discriminatory EAEC or a 
link between the free trade areas of ASEAN and Australia-New 
Zealand, or by some combination of these all within the 
framework of APEC and operating under the new GATT rules. We 
should not risk limiting our options at what is still a 
relatively early stage of our integration with this dynamic 
region.

this week between the Departments of Defense and Foreign Affairs

Australia was likely to provide a technical and engineering 
support for a UN force, but peacekeeping troops were usually 
sent only after some form of political settlement had been 
reached. 
  [Begin d'Hage recording] The sort of things that will be 
assessed this week are firstly the risk and security of our own 
troops. There was always a risk when you put military people 
in, but the risk has to be acceptable and we will also be 
looking at the likely duration. So there are a lot of factors 
to be considered before recommendations are made to government 
and government makes a decision. [end recording]

  [Text] Iraq is closing its embassy in Australia as part of 
a second round of closures of missions in middle-ranking 
countries. Financial reasons are being cited, according to 
Australian officials. 
  The first round of closures occurred six months ago. Iraq's 
missions in Australia, South Korea, Argentina, and Hungary are 
among the closures in this second round. 
  Australian officials say the Iraqi Government plans to 
maintain some properties in Australia, but it is yet to decide 
how it will be represented in Australia. Australia does not 
maintain a mission in Iraq, but it is represented via Amman in 
Jordan.

  [Text] Australia's largest industrial company, BHP, says 
it has been unaffected so far by the tension between Vietnam and 
China over the disputed Spratley Islands in the South China Sea. 
BHP is a partner in a consortium which is expected to begin 
producing oil later this year from the Dai Hung field in the 
Spratlys. The consortium leases the field from Vietnam. 
  Company's chief executive, John Prescott, has said in Hanoi 
that nothing BHP was doing or plan to do in Vietnam was impaired 
by the company's assessment of the political situation. 
However, Mr. Prescott did express disappointment at new figures 
on the likely oil reserves in the Dai Hung oil reserves in the 
Dai Hung field which was originally thought to hold 800 million 
barrels. The Dai Hung field is expected to produce up to 35,000 
barrels a day when it goes into production next October.

  [Text] SYDNEY, May 16 (AFP) -- Three young East Timorese 
and an Indonesian are being detained and tortured by President 
Suharto's elite guard over the death of one of its commanders in 
Jakarta, East Timor resistance sources said Monday. 
  The CNRM (National Council of Maubere Resistance) released a 
statement to AFP in an attempt to draw attention to the plight 
of the detainees. 
  The East Timorese resistance group said a fifth youth who 
acknowledges responsibility for his part in what was described 
as the accidental death of an off-duty Presidential Guard 
officer is in hiding. But their statement, distributed by the 
the East Timor News Agency (ETNA), added that he was willing to 
surrender and face justice if promised a lawful trial. 
  The incident was said to have happened outside "a gambling 
location" at a brothel where the five had been forced to take 
jobs as bodyguards after going to Jakarta a year ago on the 
unfulfilled promise of jobs. 
  "East Timorese students in Jakarta appeal to Presidential 
Guard members to act in accordance with their professional oath 
and protect the people, punishing wrongdoers in accordance with 
the laws of Indonesia," the statement said. "Those who protect 
the President should excel at protecting people, not at 
torturing them." 
  The statement said the five young men were promised jobs in 
Jakarta by the Indonesian Department of Labour and President 
Suharto's daughter Tutut. 
  The Presidential Guard commander was said to have been 
"hired 
by someone" to expel the East Timorese men and went in civilian 
clothes to the centre where he assumed that "as is usual in 
Indonesia, the civilians would be frightened by his presence and 
follow his orders to leave." Instead, the bodyguards resisted 
and attempted to chase the commander away, "killing him in the 
ensuing scuffle." 
  Four, named as Hercules of Ainaro, Duarte of Lospalos, 
Domingo of Ermera and Salah from the Indonesian island of Flores 
had been captured and were being kept at a special closed prison 
at the Presidential Guard headquarters.

  [Excerpts] Australia has said it has no intention of 
replacing the United States in providing military assistance to 
Indonesia. 
  The Australian ambassador to Indonesia, Allan Taylor, said 
the recent visit to Australia by Indonesia's Army Chief General 
Wismoyo Arismunandar had nothing to do with the so-called effort 
on Australia's part to replace the U.S. as a military aid donor 
to Indonesia. 
  Last year, the U.S. cut its military aid program to 
Indonesia 
following allegations that Jakarta had committed violations of 
human rights in East Timor. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Taylor said that, as far as Australia was concerned, the 
U.S. military involvement in Asia was important mainly because 
it could help generate economic growth in the region.

  [Text] Rivals Telstra and Optus have teamed up with 
Indonesian carrier PT [Private Limited] Indosat to lay a 2,100 
km fibre-optic submarine cable linking Western Australia [WA] 
and Indonesia. 
  The $140 million project will provide a third fibre 
communications path out of Australia and reinforce WA's push to 
become a regional business hub. 
  Companies dealing with Asia would be able to set up leased 
services linking them with their trading partners and offshore 
offices in the region taking advantage of the wider bandwidth 
available on the new link, officials said. 
  The Australian cable will make land near Port Hedland and 
Jakarta at the Indonesian end, providing 60 times the capacity 
of the existing analogue link between Australia, Indonesia and 
Singapore which will gradually be withdrawn. 
  A joint statement from Telecom and Optus said tenders would 
be called in July for the cable which would be ready for service 
by the end of 1996.

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, has 
released a statement on his efforts to help an Australian 
citizen detained without charge by China. Senator Evans said 
Australia had been assiduous in its efforts on behalf of James 
Pang who has been held in Shenzhen detention center since 
October because of corruption allegations. 
  Senator Evans, who released the 33-point chronology listing 
Australia's actions on behalf of Mr. Pang since October, 
expressed surprise at Australia's commitment to the case has 
been criticized in a Melbourne newspaper report. 
  He also released a copy of the letter that he had written to 
Mr. Pang's wife in Hong Kong last Friday, saying that Australia 
was taking the case very seriously. He has raised the issue of 
the Australian citizen being detained without charge with 
China's foreign minister, Qian Qichen, with Guangdong vice 
governor, Lu Ruihua, and with the first vice chairman of China's 
National People's Congress, Tian Jiyun.

<F P=106> [From Paul Cleary, AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW correspondent </F>
in Hanoi and Geoffrey Forday] 
  [Text] Australian construction and engineering firms in 
Vietnam have failed to make an impression on initial 
international tenders for major infrastructure projects, despite 
the Government's policy of using aid money to help them enter 
Asia. 
  In the first international tender for major road building 
projects in Vietnam, not one Australian company has been 
successful in getting past the first round and being invited to 
submit a formal tender. 
  The World Bank and Asian Development Bank projects to 
rebuild 
Vietnam's Highway 1, worth $US355 million, mark the first 
instalment of an expected $US10 billion to be spent over the 
decade on major capital works. 
  Ministerial documents show that out of a field of 150 
companies, about 75 were asked to tender for both projects. 
They include companies from South Korea, Malaysia, China, 
Europe, Japan and the US. The results of the tender are yet to 
be made public. 
  Leighton Asia has confirmed that it failed to prequalify for 
the tender, although the company has established a presence in 
Vietnam only recently. 
  John Holland's application, made in conjunction with the 
Japanese firm Itochu, has also missed out. 
  Thiess decided not to enter because the tender was 
considered 
too competitive. A spokesman for Transfield declined to confirm 
whether the company had applied to tender, although one company 
source had earlier said it would take part. 
  To qualify, the companies were asked to submit detailed data 
about their financial position, the amount of current work they 
had on their books and the projects they had worked on in the 
past. 
  The results of this major international tender raise 
questions about federal government efforts to showcase 
Australian construction companies in Asia. The recently opened 
Friendship Bridge between Thailand and Laos, and a proposed $100 
million bridge over the Mekong in Vietnam, are in part aimed at 
putting Australian engineering on show in Asia. 
  Thiess Contractors' general manager for South-East Asia, Mr 
Robert Logan, denied the company had lodged an expression of 
interest in the Highway One project and pointed to the large 
number of applicants the project had attracted. 
  Describing the tender process as a "free-for-all", Mr Logan 
said that with 200 or more companies bidding for the project 
"the competition was too great and too intense". 
  The general manager of Transfield's international division, 
Mr John McGarry, said he was not aware of any unsuccessful 
tender made by the company in Vietnam. 
  Mr Ross Baldwin, director of John Holland's Asian 
operations, 
confirmed that an expression of interest had been lodged for 
some of Highway One's bridge work, and said that the company was 
still waiting on news of the outcome.

  [Text] Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, says it 
is wholly legitimate for the Cambodian Government to seek 
military assistance from the international community. He was 
commenting on a warning from Thailand's security chief for 
Australia not to give military aid, saying it would only 
escalate the conflict between the Cambodian Government and the 
Khmer Rouge. 
  In a statement issued in Canberra, Senator Evans said 
Australia is giving serious consideration to the Cambodian 
Government's request for military assistance. He said Australia 
would consult with and take into account the views of other 
countries, including Thailand. 
  The foreign minister said it is in line with the Paris peace 
accord for the elected Cambodian Government to seek aid from the 
international community in order to maintain the country's 
sovereignty and territorial integrity. But Senator Evans also 
made it clear that it would be helpful if countries which 
committed themselves to the Cambodian peace process were to help 
the Armed Forces of the legitimate government.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Gill] </F>
  [Text] The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] group 
should remain focused on economic issues and avoid the 
"complications" associated with political issues, Taiwan's 
Minister of State, Mr Vincent Siew, warned yesterday. And in an 
interview with THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW [AFR] Mr Siew 
also cautioned against forcing the pace of any APEC move towards 
an institutional framework. 
  Mr Siew, in Sydney last night to address the Asia Pacific 
Insight Briefing, appeared to indicate that APEC should steer 
clear of political disputes such as the U.S. pressure on China 
over human rights. "I think it will be better for APEC to focus 
on economic issues only, not to talk about any political issues. 
(If) it gets involved in political issues, it will become very 
complicated," Mr Siew told the AFR. While APEC had made "a lot 
of progress" in the past five years, Mr Siew said he would like 
to see the organization take on an "institutional framework". 
  But such a move should only occur when a consensus had 
emerged among the APEC membership for such a "community". 
Achieving such a community, however, required patience "because 
the members of APEC come from different cultural, political, and 
social backgrounds". 
  Mr Siew said APEC's goal should be "open regionalism instead 
of the closed regionalism exercised by the Europeans and 
others". A judgment on how consistent the North American Free 
Trade Agreement and the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] were with 
open regionalism could only be made in the future. "If they 
follow the GATT rules, they will become open regionalism. If 
they just emphasize their own interests then they will just veto 
the GATT rules and the spirit (of the GATT)," he said. 
  Asked whether an Australian-New Zealand link with AFTA -- as 
mooted by the prime minister, Mr Keating, last week -- could be 
detrimental to the interests of APEC, Mr Siew said the AFTA and 
NAFTA membership had given assurances that their regional 
groupings "will not be against the general objectives of APEC". 
  "So we hope that kind of assurance can be honored," he said.

  [Text] The Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, warned 
yesterday that Australia would be expected to make further trade 
concessions as the price of developing a possible formal trade 
link with South-East Asia. 
  He said it was inevitable that there would be an entry price 
if the Federal Government pursued a link between the Closer 
Economic Relations [CER] agreement and the ASEAN Free Trade Area 
[AFTA], even though Australia's general level of tariffs was 
much lower than the ASEAN average. 
  "If we are to get some sort of agreement about an open 
trading arrangement between ourselves, we can't expect that can 
take place without Australia having to make any changes." 
  He said Australia would come to the negotiating table in a 
strong position because of the tariff reductions and economic 
opening that had taken place in Australia in the past decade, 
but "we can't expect there would be no price". 
  Senator McMullan was launching a report by the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade [DFAT] East Asia Analytical Unit on 
AFTA where he also announced that Australia would be discussing 
a possible link with New Zealand officials next week. 
  The DFAT report, AFTA: Trading Bloc or Building 
Block suggests ASEAN countries "would be keen to tap" the 
politically sensitive textiles, clothing and footwear market. 
  A CER-AFTA link would provide the opportunity for ASEAN to 
"influence and secure (tariff) reductions in areas like 
textiles, clothing and footwear and motor vehicles." 
  The report notes that Australia's anti-dumping regime 
"irritates" ASEAN countries. 
  Yesterday, Senator McMullan warned against moving too fast 
towards a formal trade link and suggested that Australia and New 
Zealand could first establish a dialogue with the AFTA countries 
to exchange information. The ASEAN secretariat Economic 
Research Bureau director, Dr Suthat Setbunsang, also said there 
would be benefits in the AFTA countries learning more about CER 
because it could provide a model for resolving many AFTA trade 
issues. 
  The DFAT report also suggests CER "dialogue" with ASEAN as a 
first step and ongoing encouragement for further trade 
liberalisation within AFTA.

  [Text] The Australian subsidiary of Japanese company NEC 
will supply satellite earth stations for the Defence 
Department's Jindalee Operational Radar Network [JORN] as part 
of a $4 million contract. 
  The deal involves four new earth stations to be constructed 
at JORN transmitter-receiver sites in Queensland and Western 
Australia and the JORN Co-ordination Centre in Adelaide. 
  As well, NEC will help expand existing earth stations at 
other Defence Department facilities to improve communications. 
  The new stations will be used to carry signals between JORN 
sites, via a transponder leased by the Defence Department on one 
of the Optus B-series satellites. 
  NEC will be required to integrate the new facilities with 
the 
management system for the overall Defence Satellite Network 
under the terms of the contract. 
  Overall control of the network will rest with the Commander 
Defence Communications Group in Canberra through the Satellite 
Facilities Control Centre in Melbourne. 
  Known as the JORNSATCOM contract, the work carried out by 
NEC 
is essentially a turn-key project and will be carried out by a 
local team skilled in such work. 
  NEC Australia's managing director, Mr Ben Okamoto, 
commenting 
on the use of commercial communications equipment by the Defence 
Department, said the JORN project represented another step 
forward in this process. 
  The Director General Joint Project Management in Defence 
Material, Brigadier Neil Horn, said Defence had a strong 
commitment to the electronics industry in Australia. 
  "The contract with NEC exemplifies the positive benefits of 
having resident high-technology companies," he said.

  [Text] Two decades of plummeting oil prices have, at 
times, come close to scuttling the $12 billion North West Shelf 
[NWS] liquified natural gas project and have now forced the 
partners into a massive rearrangement of spending priorities. 
  Woodside Petroleum Ltd, project operator, recently shed 429 
staff in a bid to slash $100 million from its operating costs 
and is screwing back capital expenditure to lift revenue from 
the project. 
  When development of the North Rankin, Goodwyn and Angel gas 
fields began, oil prices were around $US20 and expected to reach 
at least $US40 over the next 20 to 30 years. 
  Steadily rising oil prices were expected to underpin the 
massive borrowings required to fund the $12 billion project and 
provide an adequate return on the total investment. 
  But oil prices defied the most pessimistic outlook and 
lifted 
the NWS project's payback period by at least a decade. 
  Now the project's revenue earnings must rise while operating 
costs are cut to generate the kind of profit level required to 
provide a decent return on the billions of dollars invested so 
far. 
  Dramatic growth forecasts for LNG demand in Japan and other 
Asian countries is underpinning future LNG sales with every 
current Japanese buyer understood to consider a fourth NWS LNG 
train a certain source of future supply. 
  The initial 20 year LNG export contracts signed between the 
NWS partners and eight Japanese customers now barely cover the 
project's cash operating costs, with the remainder used to repay 
interest on the investment capital and reward shareholders. 
  The LNG contracts were expected to quickly repay the capital 
and then generate large profits but the collapse in oil prices, 
and by extension the LNG price, has dramatically changed the 
North West Shelf partners' game plan. 
  Woodside has not yet repaid any of the principal of well 
over 
$1 billion it has borrowed to fund its share of the NWS project. 
  A radical rethink of future development options has seen 
plans for a third offshore production platform deferred for at 
least a decade and improved the prospects for the fourth LNG 
train. 
  Lifting cash returns by better utilising the existing 
off-shore and onshore assets more effectively means gas 
production by North Rankin A and Goodwyn platforms will be well 
above initial plans to feed possibly two new LNG production 
trains. 
  The third offshore platform, on the Angel gas field, will 
not 
be built this century as planned, but will be delayed possibly 
until as late as 2010, saving up to $2 billion. 
  To supply additional gas volumes, required for an extra one 
or two LNG trains reserves closer to the existing Goodwyn A and 
North Rankin A platforms are likely to be developed, either 
using sub-sea well completions or by directional drilling from 
either of the two platforms. 
  The North Rankin West field containing 0.45 trillion cu ft 
(TCF) proved and probable gas reserves is a prime candidate for 
development using directional drilling from the North Rankin A 
platform. 
  A recent big seismic program around the Goodwyn/North Rankin 
fields is likely to throw up more, adjacent, potential gas 
reserves, with the exciting West Dixon discovery a principal 
target. 
  Woodside managing director, Mr Charles Allen, said the staff 
cuts would save about $50 million, with another $50 million in 
savings expected to come from tight controls over operating 
costs in addition to $50 million in savings achieved in 1993. 
  Mr Allen said the NWS partners expected to get full value 
out 
of the NWS project assets only once full plateau production had 
been reached, due to occur in 1995.

<F P=106> [Article by Shigeru Komago from Washington: "Breakthrough </F>
in the Japan-U.S. Trade Talks: The Next Two Months Are Crucial"] 
  [Text] Rapid appreciation of the yen and depreciation of 
the dollar, and the volatility of the Japanese political 
situation have, ironically, opened up the possibility of 
resolving the deadlock over Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. The 
U.S. administration has come to feel strongly the importance of 
Japan-U.S. interdependence, and realizes that "excessive 
pressure on Japan will have the opposite effect, and will 
undermine U.S. interests as well." 
  The key to bringing about a breakthrough in bilateral trade 
talks is whether Japan will be able to correct its rigid stance 
over the next two months while the temporary U.S. "cease-fire," 
as evidenced in the suspension of sanctions against Japan over 
government procurement, takes effect. 
<H5>  Statement With the U.S. Congress in Mind </H5>
  After a meeting of the U.S. Government policy coordination 
body, the National Economic Council (NEC) last weekend, a senior 
White House official said: "This time, Japan will surely get 
our message." He was talking about the flexible approach of the 
United States to Japan--for instance, the "suspension for two 
months" of procedures to impose sanctions under the U.S. Omnibus 
Trade Act on the issue of Japanese Government procurement. 
Coordinated intervention in the foreign exchange market was 
also part of such efforts. 
  While the statement made by U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) 
Mickey Kantor indicating the new U.S. attitude also contained 
tough expressions, such as: "Japanese Government procurement of 
supercomputers continues to be subject to special monitoring," 
the fact that the statement was made late on a Saturday 
afternoon without an attendant news conference, as if it was 
being hidden from the public, clearly shows Kantor wanted to 
avoid irritating Congress by adopting a softer stance. 
  There had been heated debate in the NEC before this 
conclusion was reached. Against the USTR's strong wish to push 
through with sanctions, the NEC staff and officials of the 
Departments of the Treasury and Commerce took a more cautious 
attitude. The USTR, which had had a major say on the matter 
since the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
in mid-February, was held in check for once. 
<H5>  Apprehensions Over Rapid Yen Appreciation </H5>
  According to a Treasury official, the decisive argument was: 
"Japan and the United States are in the same boat in a 
relationship of interdependence." Any further pressure on 
Japan, it was argued, would cause further yen appreciation and 
dollar depreciation, a trend which had already been aggravated 
by the inauguration of the Hata administration, which is 
believed to have a very shaky hold on power. The result would 
not only delay economic recovery in Japan, it could also dampen 
U.S. economic conditions with a rise in long-term U.S. interest 
rates, which in turn could bring about chaos in the world market. 
  "Economic confrontation between Japan and the United States 
does more harm than good." Faced with the historic prospect of 
the exchange rate dipping below 100 yen to a dollar, the U.S. 
administration, at long last, began to take a realistic view. 
Kantor had also presented to Tsutomu Hata, (then) deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister, proposals on the pending issue of 
objective criteria in the framework talks which were more 
acceptable to Japan. The new suggestions linked the issue to 
the "objectives of the framework talks" to increase Japanese 
imports and expand foreign participation in the Japanese market. 
The United States has not taken a more considerate stance 
toward Japan since July last year. 
  Nevertheless, the position adopted by the United States has 
a 
deadline of "two months." Depending on the Japanese response, 
the United States may turn to a tougher USTR-inspired position 
just before the meeting of leaders of the advanced countries 
(the Naples summit) in July. 
  Japanese bureaucrats have been quick to voice the opinion 
that "the United States has no right to press Japan to respond 
by imposing a deadline." This attitude may offset all the 
efforts by U.S. officials to take a more moderate position. If 
Japan continues to talk and act as if under a spell which forces 
it to answer "no" to every suggestion, there can be no 
improvement in the situation. 
  On the other hand, former Under Secretary of State Robert 
Zoellick advises that "right now, if only Japan compromises a 
little, the situation may improve." For example, if Japan makes 
certain concessions on government procurement, where the United 
States has suspended the imposition of sanctions, there is the 
possibility that a solution in this area may be reached very 
quickly. 
<H5>  Speculation About a Final Solution in "September" </H5>
  As far as tax reform, one of the keys to a compromise 
between 
the two countries, is concerned, the belief is growing even in 
the United States that the Social Democratic Party of Japan's 
decision to leave the coalition government has made it 
impossible for any sort of tax reform policy to be decided upon 
before the end of June. Even if a conclusion on tax reform is 
delayed, however, Japan might still be able to get round this if 
something is done about the midterm prospects of the current 
account surplus. 
  Furthermore, the prevailing view in the White House is that 
final agreement on the framework talks will come in "September," 
rather than July. 
  Although at present the dominant view within the U.S. 
administration is that it would not be wise to corner a 
politically unstable Japan, it is high time Japan also came up 
with effective ideas.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 18 May 1994 Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Vice ministerial-level preliminary negotiations on 
the resumption of Japan-U.S. economic framework talks will begin 
on 19 May. The main purpose of the negotiations is to air views 
on the conditions for resuming talks set by the United 
States--these include the enforcement of macroeconomic measures 
such as tax reduction, and the setting of objective criteria to 
measure the degree of market liberalization. The negotiations 
are expected to deal with a range of issues, including a 
possible compromise agreement to set objective criteria only on 
government procurements. Efforts to converge views will be 
hastened at working-level negotiations so that the framework 
talks may resume before the Japan-U.S. summit in July. 
  The government will send Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy vice 
minister for foreign affairs, and Suzaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice 
minister for international trade and industry, to the 
preliminary negotiations in Washington, and they will begin 
informal meetings with U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey 
Kantor and Deputy USTR Charlene Barshefsky to find a 
breakthrough to the impasse in the framework talks. They will 
hear specific explanations of three U.S.-demanded conditions, 
including macroeconomic measures and clarification of the 
purpose of the framework talks, and will present Japan's 
responses to them. They will probe to uncover the real 
intention of the United States, whose position on macroeconomic 
measures can be interpreted as having softened somewhat. 
  The focus of the negotiations will be the search for a 
compromise on the question of setting objective criteria. Since 
U.S. President Clinton declared "we are not seeking numerical 
targets," Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa has proposed 
setting "some kind of quantum [ryoteki] criteria which would not 
lead to actual numerical targets." Negotiations will 
concentrate on this issue, though also discuss ways to expand 
imports of foreign commodities and services into Japan. 
  Of the three priority areas of government procurement, 
automobiles and auto parts, and insurance, Japan feels 
government procurements is one in which deregulation on access 
procedures has made progress, and see agreement near to 
realization. Japan is expected to propose the idea of setting 
criteria in the area of government procurement first. It will 
also try to steer the United States toward a compromise by 
presenting a "step-by-step approach" to deal with the question 
of setting criteria in the areas of insurance and automobiles 
and auto parts. 
  As far as macroeconomic measures are concerned, Japan will 
seek the understanding of the United States by announcing its 
intention to continue reducing income taxes into next year and 
beyond. The United States is concerned lest the current delay 
in finding a breakthrough in Japan-U.S. economic relations leads 
the dollar to lose value further and long-term interest rates to 
rise. 
  The U.S. attitude toward Japan appears to have softened on 
the surface at least, but Japan wants to know its "true 
intentions" under the surface. It also wants to exchange 
information to help determine whether demands are acceptable.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] Japan and the United States have begun to move 
toward the resumption of bilateral framework trade talks for the 
first time in three months. Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy vice 
minister of international trade and industry, and Sadayuki 
Hayashi, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs, will visit the 
United States on 19 May to begin unofficial talks with the U.S. 
Government. Behind this move lies the fact that the Clinton 
administration can no longer put pressure on Japan at a time 
when a sudden surge in long-term interest rates, caused by the 
dollar depreciation, might have a negative effect on the U.S. 
economy, and that the Hata government intends to strengthen its 
foundation by breaking the stalemate in the trade talks. 
Despite the Hata cabinet's intention, the trade talks will 
continue to be rough because it is still unclear whether the 
minority Hata coalition can implement multiyear tax cuts as a 
macroeconomic measure. 
  After the breakdown of the summit meeting in February, 
Japan-U.S. relations were put in "abnormal circumstances." U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor gave strict orders to U.S. 
negotiators not to meet Japanese bureaucrats and as a result, no 
contacts were made. However, following the inauguration of the 
Hata government, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and 
International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata met with 
U.S. Government officials. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also 
held a telephone conference with President Bill Clinton. As 
such, there are signs that bilateral relations are improving. 
  It is believed that Washington has changed its attitude 
toward Japan because it can no longer maintain its policy of 
putting pressure for the yen to further appreciate at a time 
when rapid appreciation of the yen might lead to a triple drop 
in U.S. bonds, stock prices, and the value of the dollar, and a 
sudden rise in long-term interest rates might have adverse 
effect on the U.S. economy. Also, alarmed by a letter 
complaining of Washington's Asia policy, which was sent by U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord to Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, the Clinton administration has shown a 
tendency of reviewing its economy-oriented diplomacy toward 
Japan. 
  Meanwhile, it is said that the Hata cabinet is eager to 
resume talks with Washington because it hopes to strengthen its 
foundation through the improvement of relations with the United 
States so that it can maintain its centripetal force even after 
the passage of the 1994 budget bill, enabling it to promote tax 
reform and deregulation. Because "it is not allowed to make a 
mistake again," the two sides have agreed to hold unofficial, 
subcabinet-level meetings first. 
  In Japan, some people argue that if Tokyo and Washington 
agree to resume trade talks, they should adopt a "two-step 
plan." They propose that negotiations on government procurement 
and insurance should virtually be concluded by early July, 
before the (G-7) Naples summit opens, and then talks on 
automobiles and auto parts, a sector in which there is conflict 
of opinions between the two countries, should be concluded by 
the end of September, which is the deadline for Washington to 
invoke the Super 301 provision of the U.S. Trade Act (which 
outlines steps for retaliation against trade partners' unfair 
practices). However, this plan is possible only when the ruling 
and opposition parties reach an agreement on tax cuts and 
sources to fund the cuts by the end of June. An official at the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said: "If 
this macroecnomic measure is scrapped, it will be impossible for 
the government to obtain concessions from Washington in 
negotiations on each trade sector." Nevertheless, it is 
uncertain whether the ruling and opposition parties will be able 
to reach an agreement. 
  Main topics in the negotiations on government procurement 
and 
insurance will be what method should be used to gauge the 
openness of markets and what measures should be taken to promote 
deregulation in each trade sector. A top MITI official said the 
Japanese Government hopes hopes to avoid the "theological 
argument" over the issue of whether to call it numerical target 
or objective criteria and to "start concrete discussions as soon 
as possible. However, whether Washington will change its policy 
toward Japan and make a compromise over numerical targets "will 
not be known until the trade talks resume" (according to a MITI 
official).

<F P=106> [Discussion from Tokyo Experts' Symposium organized by </F>
YOMIURI SHIMBUN attended by Sophia University Professor Shoichi 
Watanabe; Nomura Research Institute Director Yoshio Suzuki; 
Takeshi Noda, Liberal Democratic Party Diet member; Keio 
University Associate Professor Heizo Takenaka; and International 
Christian University Professor Roger Buckley; moderated by 
Broadcast Education Development Center Director Hidetoshi Kato; 
held at Aoyama Gakuin University Research Institute on 20 April: 
"What Should the United States and Japan Reform?"] 
  [Text] [Kato] Both the United States and Japan are 
approaching turning points in many different areas such as the 
economy, politics, government, and education reform. Domestic 
and bilateral issues for the United States and Japan will be the 
main subjects of our discussion here. But, the U.S.-Japan 
relationship will undoubtedly have an influence on other 
countries in the world. Keeping that point in mind, I would like 
to encourage our discussion. 
<H5>  Consideration Must Also Be Given to "Security" -- Roger </H5>
Buckley 
  [Buckley] From an outsider's point of view, I would like to 
make three short proposals, or policy suggestions: 
  First, to think from a historical perspective. Second, to 
have greater political insight. Third, to have vision on a 
global scale. 
  We must first consider everything from an historical 
perspective. As for the discussion on U.S.-Japan relations, a 
disproportionately large amount of interest is being paid to 
such issues as the latest trade statistics, economic news, 
finance, and so on. 
  I am afraid that a clear understanding of the origin and 
development of their relationship is totally missing in both 
countries. Even students at the International Christian 
University (ICU) and Tokyo University, where I teach, have very 
little understanding and recognition of the development of 
U.S.-Japanese relations. We should be worried and concerned 
about such a lack of knowledge. If people do not recognize how 
things evolve, we risk the danger that some specific interest 
groups could capture the heart of the masses. Needless to say, 
the responsibility of the mass media and educational systems in 
both countries is vitally important in this regard. 
  Second, I want to suggest that people think matters over 
with 
greater political emphasis. They should not just be concerned 
about trade friction but should think in terms of the larger 
framework, that is security. 
  It should be recognized, especially in the United States, 
that the U.S.-Japan relationship is basically the product of the 
Cold War, and beyond that, the pacific war. The security aspect 
has always been at the center of the alliance relationship. And 
today, when the international environment has drastically 
changed, leaders must be able to prove that it is still correct 
to continue this relationship. To do that, substantial thought 
and political will must be present in both countries. 
  Third, I propose that thinking be on a global scale. This 
alliance relationship casts a great influence over every country 
in the world. And, I am worried this is not fully recognized. 
The European Union (EU) is extremely apprehensive that, when 
bilateral negotiations between the United States and Japan take 
place, third parties may be shut out and not given equal 
treatment. In Northeast Asia, U.S.-Japan relations will have a 
great effect on the Korean peninsula. Recently, I heard from 
many Korean scholars that the Korean economy will be gravely 
affected unless the United States and Japan somehow manage 
issues which lie between them. The current U.S.-Japan 
relationship may be said to have been constructed after the war 
by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and Prime Minister Yoshida, 
but it was modeled on the Anglo-Japanese alliance concluded in 
1902. The Anglo-Japanese alliance collapsed a generation later. 
The United States and Japan must somehow transcend the past. 
  [Suzuki] What is the problem with the Japanese economic 
policy? A very high savings rate is characteristic of the 
Japanese economy. The personal savings rate is about 15 
percent. This is exceedingly high among developed countries. 
Five percent is spent on housing investment and the remaining 
10 percent is kept as excess savings. During the high-growth 
period, enterprises borrowed these excess savings for use in 
modernization investment. 
  When the high-growth period ended, business investment 
declined and savings went up. In the latter half of the 1970's, 
a large amount of deficit-offsetting national bonds were issued 
and absorbed these savings to prevent recession. 
  Then the fiscal imbalance worsened greatly, so that by the 
early 1980's, even the public sector no longer could absorb 
domestic savings. Then, the only remaining channel for excess 
personal savings, which is as much as 10 percent of the gross 
national product (GNP), became the overseas sector. That is the 
fundamental reason why Japan started steadily running up a 
current account surplus from the early 1980's. 
  The exchange rate which was Y [yen] 240 to $1 at the time of 
the Plaza Accord (1985) is now Y103 to $1. Even with the 
appreciation of the yen to such a degree, the surplus has not 
decreased. Based on surveys of savings motives, it is clear 
that people are saving for specific purposes such as "housing," 
"living expenses in old age," and "education and wedding funds 
for children." 
  They save because they feel uncertain about their future. 
The money saved is not spent within Japan, so the current 
account surplus accumulates. Because the surplus accumulates 
the yen keeps appreciating, and a recession which is caused by 
the high yen occurs. Uncertainty about unemployment and 
bankruptcy appears. The Japanese industries shift their 
production bases to overseas, and industry faces the danger of 
hollowing. The people save even more because they feel 
uncertain. An economic policy with the definite intention of 
pulling the Japanese economy out of this vicious circle was 
needed, but this realization came extremely slowly. 
  However, the Hiraiwa Report submitted by the "Economic 
Reform 
Research Council," a private advisory body to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, of which I was a member, finally focused on that 
point. Just what is wrong with the Japanese economic system? 
To the United States, it seems that policy is in fact 
determined in a closed room by close-knit politicians and 
bureaucrats. Or all sorts of regulations exist in the name of 
administrative guidance and that is why U.S. businesses cannot 
get into the Japanese market. This is the basis of their 
demands for deregulation and market opening in Japan. 
  When I calculate it, according to the current exchange rate, 
the Japanese gross domestic product (GDP) is 40 percent higher 
than the U.S. level. Why then, is our standard of living lower? 
  First, the purchasing power parity of Tokyo and New York is 
Y168 for $1, so our per capita GDP is 10 percent lower than that 
of the United States. Moreover, housing costs are several to 
ten times higher in Japan. The main purpose of saving is to 
purchase housing. That is why everybody tries so hard to save. 
Third, because regulations are stringent, the choices for the 
Japanese consumer are very limited. Finally, Japanese capital 
investment on infrastructure such as sewerage, parks, and roads 
is less than that in the United States. 
  To correct these four points, we must first achieve 
deregulation. We would promote competition and reduce the 
domestic and overseas price gap. Housing costs would also go 
down as the result of deregulation. Second, we would broaden 
"new business frontiers" such as information media. When these 
measures were taken, the domestic investment rate would go up. 
And finally, the government should issue more national 
construction bonds and make investment in infrastructure and new 
social capital. Consequently, the savings rate would go down. 
The private investment rate would go up, living standards would 
rise, and at the same time, the current account surplus would 
shrink. Also, the lack of transparency in the Japanese economic 
system and its strong regulation would be corrected. 
<H5>  Some Excessive Changes in the U.S. -- Heizo Takenaka </H5>
  [Kato] As for housing, what are the other key deregulations? 
  [Suzuki] One is the Land and House Rent Law. In the recent 
revision of the law, a fixed-term land-lease contract was added. 
As a result it became possible that, for example, a Y50 million 
apartment could be made available at Y30 million if it were 
accompanied by a fixed-term land lease. I wonder if, in the 
future, fixed-term house leases or fixed-term contracts for 
already existing contracts may be added. If such deregulation 
takes place, Japanese housing costs and land costs would change 
quite a bit. 
  [Takenaka] The February Clinton-Hosokawa meeting ended 
without agreement, but the United States advocated so-called 
managed trade and raised the demand that Japan should increase 
imports in a manner which would disrupt the market mechanism. 
That was clearly the wrong policy, and Japan was correct in 
having said "No." For the United States, the real issue is 
whether it can maintain its past standard of living today and in 
the future. Such an economic issue has surfaced as a social 
issue -- that is important. 
  One generation before the current baby boomers, people in 
their forties were, before they reached the age of 30-40, able 
to double their real income as the beneficiaries of economic 
development. But the baby boomers could only raise their income 
level at that by 35 percent. People in their twenties today, 
who are sometimes called the "busters," might have a lower 
standard of living than their parents. Such long-term economic 
decline has emerged as a concrete social issue. 
  The Clinton administration is seriously trying to reduce the 
fiscal deficit, unlike past administrations. But fiscal 
reconstruction means the reduction of government spending or a 
tax increase, so in the medium to long-term a deflationary 
effect will definitely be felt. At that point, the unemployment 
issue, stagnant income growth, and the standard of living issue 
will really become full blown. 
  The U.S. Government needed a policy to cancel out its 
deflation. For that, in fact, there was no other course than to 
pursue overseas demand -- exports. So the United States sought 
a "frontier" for the first time in 100 years. The target of 
this frontier had to be set in the Asia Pacific region, where 
the growth rate was the highest, and in Japan which was at its 
center. 
  The United States is now trying to make many changes, but 
there are facts they must really keep in mind as lessons of 
history. There was, in fact, a period which was called the "era 
of change," in U.S. history. It was roughly a 20-year period in 
the early 20th century. The Federal Reserve Board (FRB) was 
created in this period, too. Also measures to ensure 
competition with government intervention, such as the antitrust 
laws, were established for the first time. 
  But during the era of change, policies that were clearly 
excessive were also implemented. A typical example is the 
Prohibition Law. The Immigration Law, which banned immigration, 
is another example of excess. As a result, the U.S. population 
did not increase. When population does not increase, 
consumption does not go up, in particular, housing investment 
does not go up. The stagnation of housing investment led later 
to the Great Depression. There is a possibility that such 
excessive reforms could also be carried out today, reforms which 
would not be viable in the long run. I wonder if managed trade 
is a typical example. Initially, the argument of managed trade 
in order to protect domestic employment sounds good, but such 
managed trade would drive the economy to become smaller, size, 
albeit balanced, and would ultimately bring about unfortunate 
results, not only for the United States but also for the entire 
world. 
  What should Japan do under such circumstances? First, the 
United States needs a frontier in order to carry out its fiscal 
reconstruction. The frontier could have a great effect on the 
United States and Japan should become an attractive frontier. 
By continuing to be a vibrant, attractive market, Japan could 
have the power to prevent excessive U.S. change, particularly 
managed trade. Second, to become the frontier, Japan must 
elevate its standard of living through deregulation and by 
expanding social overhead capital. 
  Finally, if we consider savings to be a "claim for future 
consumption," then such accumulation is national wealth. We are 
making great efforts to accumulate such national wealth, but we 
have been making a terribly risky investment in the United 
States with an important portion of this national wealth -- 
moreover with dollar-based "paper money." The dollar has now 
dropped and national wealth is decreasing. Making such a poor 
choice is unthinkable. When a Commerce Department economist 
asked me what kind of strategy for national wealth Japan had, I 
could not answer. I think we should reexamine the strategy for 
national wealth. The concrete substance for it should be 
deregulation and accumulation of social overhead capital. 
  [Kato] By the way, when I was watching an American TV news 
show the day before yesterday, I noted that Vietnam was whited 
out, and the reporter was saying that here was a frontier. 
<H5>  Political Reform Has Not Been Completed -- Takeshi Noda </H5>
  [Noda] As one of those responsible for political reform, I 
would like to talk about this and also talk further about Asia 
and U.S.-Japan issues. It has been almost five years since 
political reform became the main subject of Japanese politics. 
Because the Recruit scandal broke out and we were in the midst 
of political mistrust, reform tended to be cast mainly in terms 
of preventing corruption. In addition, it was understood that 
reform could not be carried out unless the electoral system was 
changed. There were many faults in the medium sized electoral 
district system. But what led to selecting the single seat 
electoral system was, first of all, that an electoral system 
which would permit an immediate switch over of the government 
when scandals occurred, would also give a stronger sense of 
alertness to behavior for both government party and opposition 
parties. 
  Lead by Tsutomu Hata, Masaharu Goto, and others, we have 
been 
tackling the situation. But before the electoral system was 
changed, the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] government ended and 
a change of government took place. Therefore, the argument 
arose that, without changing the system, a change of government 
had been accomplished, and some people felt we received whiplash. 
  On the contrary, I feel thankful that a new meaning has 
emerged. Since the war, we have been living in a middle position 
where the pull from both East and West magnetic poles was 
strong. There was a difference of thinking, not only in the 
security aspect, but also regarding economic and political 
systems, and both East and West poles functioned as strong 
magnetic fields. 
  But when one pole disappeared, the other pole followed. The 
existence of strongholds for conservatism and reform--the LDP 
and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]--were no longer 
needed. In other words, we were thrown into a situation where 
there was no magnetic field. That is the political situation 
today. As I think this over, I have come to realize that 
historically, it is very rare for a strong magnetic field to 
come into effect which covers the world and even transcends 
religious differences. I think that what will be notable in the 
future is fragmented regional, religious, and national 
identities in international society. In Japan also, there are 
many divisions. It has become very difficult to keep people in 
the framework of a political party. If nothing is done, we will 
have the era of many small parties, similar to the Italy of the 
past. 
  I think that the single-seat electoral system adopted this 
time will achieve the function of preventing parties from being 
divided into too many small groups. Otherwise, without the 
single-seat system, the situation would develop into a state of 
drift: We would not know where the government was heading. My 
feeling is that for a while, a number of small parties in 
combination would form a government. 
  It was unfortunate that originally, political reform began 
as 
a result of the Recruit scandal. But, if the politicians 
themselves and the political system are not trusted by the 
people, no policy can gain support and there can be no will to 
make decisions promptly. In that sense, just four bills have 
passed, but political reform has not been completed. We must 
also ask the voters themselves to reform their consciousness. 
We must start changing the local election systems. Reform by 
the politicians themselves is also necessary. 
  Next, on the U.S.-Japan relationship. The Japanese people 
have been caught up by the economic relationship alone. It is 
as if a trade war were going on, so much emphasis has been 
placed on this issue. I am worried about whether it might 
foment a hate-the-U.S. consciousness. U.S.-Japan security is, 
as Professor Buckley stated, not only a bilateral issue. It is 
necessary to recognize how much positive influence the existence 
of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty system has on Asia. The 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is the great premise for Japanese 
foreign policy toward Asia. Therefore, we must give enough 
thought to how not to tie the economic issue to the security 
issue. The only saving grace is that there is no such movement 
to link trade and security right now in the United States. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, the Shinseito secretary general, is not a 
nationalist, but an enthusiastic internationalist. He is an 
internationalist who places great importance on the United 
States. Of course, the relationship with the United States is 
vitally important. But, at the same time, the one with Asia is 
also important. We must remember what happened in our past 
history, not only as a debt which we have to pay back, but also 
as a lesson which we must learn. We need to develop foreign 
policy from a position as an Asian nation. If we forget this, 
Japan may start drifting. Extreme caution is needed for setting 
our foreign policy. 
  Japan must behave with pride and modesty in its foreign 
relationships. 
  [Watanabe] Many definitions are given for the English word 
"people," such as "persons, masses, populace," etc. But I read 
a novel recently and felt that "people" in the United States had 
to be translated as "everybody," as that term is used in Japan's 
rural society. Among the "people" there is no one with a 
superior position. Among the people who first emigrated to the 
United States, clergymen, judges, prosecutors, and any other 
positions were selected by everybody. 
  The opinion of the "people" is absolute. For instance, in 
the United States, judges who are trial specialists do not have 
the right to give the verdict of guilty or not guilty. It 
belongs only to the people. If the jury of 12 people who are 
nearly randomly chosen say not guilty, the judge cannot render a 
guilty verdict. 
  As for the president too, when one is elected, the "people" 
will follow him. But there is the absolute certainty that 
ultimately the "people" are above him. What Japan should worry 
about is how the American "people" regard Japan. And we must 
devise a way to appeal correctly to the "people." 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa went to the United States and said 
that "we will not accept managed trade." That was a just 
argument. But just what percent of the American "people" 
understood "managed trade"? Prime Minister Hosokawa should have 
used language the "people" would have understood. 
  He should have said "managed trade means the Japanese 
Government is to order business enterprises to buy so much of 
such and such an item, and we cannot do that," and further "the 
Japanese per capita purchase from the United States is $417, and 
the American from Japan is $445, nearly parity" (based on MITI 
figures). The American "people" have come to believe that Japan 
was unfair, tricky. Then, U.S. politicians and bureaucrats who 
curry the "people's" favor make a move, and people such as U.S. 
Trade Representative Kantor make unreasonable demands on Japan 
in order to pacify the "people." The "people" understand 
fairness and unfairness. Specialists will easily be swayed by 
the "people." 
  At the time of World War II, we should have made public the 
Hull note, given to us at the end of November 1941, and we 
should have appealed to the American people saying "this is a de 
facto declaration of the breaking of a diplomatic relationship." 
  I think it is a dangerous situation that the United States 
feels it no longer has a frontier. When the frontier in the 
West was gone, it proposed we should jointly manage the South 
Manchurian Railroad which Japan captured right after the 
Russo-Japanese War. In the end, Japan turned this proposal down. 
After the refusal, the U.S. policy toward Japan changed 
completely because they felt "Japan has closed our frontier." 
  Therefore, the United States does not know how Japan could 
become the American frontier. Moreover, every American feels 
that the trade deficit with Japan is due to Japanese unfairness. 
There is no valid basis for such beliefs, but it will not do 
any good telling this to the American bureaucrats and the 
President. We must tell the "people." 
  I think it is necessary to send two ambassadors to 
"people's" 
countries such as the United States. One is the sort of 
ambassador who is currently in place. He will be exclusively an 
administrative ambassador. The other is an "ambassador to the 
people," to whom the American "people" will want to listen; it 
could be an attractive actress. Or we could have a poll 
conducted by a U.S. opinion survey organization to find out 
which Japanese the Americans want to meet today, and appoint 
that person as ambassador. 
  That person should appear constantly before the mass media 
and repeat: "U.S.-Japanese trade has already achieved parity, 
and the balance of trade that the President advocates means that 
a Japanese person should buy twice what an American is buying: 
We cannot accept such unfairness." Thus we could eliminate a 
dangerous element in U.S.-Japanese friction. 
  [Noda] By and large I agree with the deregulation Suzuki 
advocated. But how will deregulation lead to economic recovery? 
  Looking at it from the U.S. point of view, the Japanese 
distribution structure is certainly complicated. Once one 
becomes a part of this structure, sales go very smoothly because 
the end users do not have any choice. The problem is sales to 
enterprises. Let us say, for instance, one tries to sell some 
research equipment components. The seller receives a good 
response from the initial contact person in charge and thinks 
this will "fly." But at the last minute, the president of the 
bank that enterprise has dealings with complains. The existence 
of business groups known as keiretsu makes entry by a new comer 
into the field very difficult, even among Japanese. They form 
unions, associations, and other societies of their own in each 
field. 
  Such bodies are not necessarily officially sanctioned by the 
government; they exist de facto. How can we punch a hole into 
such a situation? We tend to think that once we achieve 
deregulation, everything will go well. But I wonder if what is 
really necessary is to put a knife into our society. 
  [Suzuki] Naturally, there are bright and dark sides to 
deregulation. Deregulation promotes competition. So, as the 
result of severe competition, enterprises which supply goods at 
fair prices to the consumers, the Japanese people, will grow. 
Enterprises which fail in such an effort will fall. It is a 
hard world where all responsibility rests on oneself. 
  Not every enterprise which existed before the implementation 
of deregulation has grown: Some went bankrupt. As Noda pointed 
out, deregulation also has some aspects which worsen business 
conditions, and we might see an increase in the number of 
enterprises that go bankrupt. But at the same time, a low-price 
revolution would occur, and real purchasing power would go up. 
This would result in stimulating business conditions. In some 
aspects, the Japanese distribution system is protected by 
regulations. We must change the system so that Japanese and 
foreign enterprises can compete and supply goods on a global 
scale at good prices for Japanese consumers -- this through some 
additional deregulation. 
  By abolishing unnecessary regulations and by making existing 
regulations transparent, foreign enterprises would know why and 
where the regulations exist. 
  But everything will not be solved. That is because there is 
a difference in thought patterns among Japanese, Northeast 
Asians, and Europeans and Americans. For instance, Americans 
try to maximize business profit during the President's tenure, 
by half-term or half year. They judge fairness by spot dealing. 
The Japanese think in longer terms, so network dealing such as 
in keiretsu becomes important. Such differences of thought and 
consciousness stem from cultural differences which cannot 
transcend deregulation. We have no other way than to try to 
understand each other. 
  [Kato] Do you have any opinions about Watanabe's idea of 
sending two ambassadors? 
  [Buckley] It is certainly a problem that knowledge of Japan 
is very shallow in the United States. I wonder if one out of a 
million Americans would know who the Japanese ambassador is. I 
think only the elite would know who he is. So I think it would 
be a monumental job to let the "people" know. 
  [Watanabe] Anyway, things are in a crisis stage now... if it 
comes to that, I even think we could ask the crown princess to 
be the "people's" ambassador. Because the "people" think Japan 
is unfair, unreasonable proposals such as the one on Motorola 
have been made. 
  [Takenaka] The Japanese economy has been driven to the point 
where we have no choice but to implement deregulation, even if 
it is accompanied by short-term pain. 
  There is a perfect double structure in Japan; one sector 
which boasts world scale productivity, represented by 
automobiles and consumer appliances, and another sector which is 
protected by strong regulation. For example, there are the 
Y100-to-a-dollar industries, in other words, industries which 
could manage even with the exchange rate of Y100 to a dollar, 
and industries which would not be internationally competitive 
even at Y200 to a dollar. 
  The Y100 industries have made great efforts to raise their 
productivity. Those very industries with high productivity are 
now in a truly difficult situation. Toyota and Nissan will push 
their overseas production bases in an all-out manner, so they 
can survive. But in Japan itself the employment issue will come 
to the surface, and in the end, only the Y200 industries might 
remain. 
  It is not only employment and unemployment issues. The yen 
will come down rapidly again. I think the high yen will go on 
for quite a while, but in the very long term, the yen will 
decline. 
  Japan has already imported all sorts of goods and is 
depending on foreign countries for supplies, so when the value 
of the yen goes down, inflation will begin. The scenario of a 
"hard landing," where unemployment and inflation occur 
concurrently, would be possible with the backdrop of the 
Japanese double structure. 
  Therefore, unless we carry out deregulation, even at the 
cost 
of substantial short-term pain, and make the Y200 industries 
competitive, we will not be able to escape the current vicious 
circle. 
  The amount of per capita imports Watanabe cited is an 
important point. But several years ago, economist Robert Reich 
wrote an interesting thesis, "Who Are We?" The United States 
has become so much more diversified, and it has become difficult 
to tell who the "people" are. Under such circumstances, 
economic friction is generated inside the Washington, D.C., 
Beltway. Unfortunately, the uncompromising theories of 
specialists have become stronger. 
  There is only one way Japan can counter such a situation. 
That is for the consumer to make a stronger effort. The 
consumer could start a boycott movement against enterprises such 
as Motorola, which entered the market through strong-arm 
tactics. They could stage demonstrations demanding 
liberalization against government offices which have 
regulations. Because there is no such movement in Japanese 
society, the U.S. and Japanese governments have collided. The 
final justification lies in consumer interest. 
<H5>  Society at a Turning Point -- Hidetoshi Kato </H5>
  [Kato] We live in an information society. But only 
exchanges between government offices in Kasumigaseki and 
Washington are reported. We think we know the United States, 
but in fact, I think we do not know the "people" Watanabe is 
talking about. The same thing can be said about American 
journalists. They gather information around Nagata-cho, 
Kasumigaseki, and Marunouchi, and report "they say such and such 
in Tokyo." From reading MAINICHI SHIMBUN's daily reports, I 
feel they tend to make judgments on the U.S.-Japan relationship 
based on every comment made by high-ranking U.S. Government 
officials. 
  We would now like to take questions from the floor. 
  [Unidentified attendee] As for deregulation, to what extent 
is deregulation necessary? 
  [Suzuki] As it is stated in the Hiraiwa Report, regulations 
are roughly classified as being economic or social regulations. 
As for economic regulation, in principle, we want to totally 
liberalize. Only if the economic structure would not function 
if total liberalization were carried out do we want to keep 
regulation as an exception. Those regulations should be set 
with clear reasoning and in a transparent manner. As for social 
regulations, we would continue to keep regulations in place 
through providing clear reasoning -- if we are not to neglect 
the maintenance of social order, for instance, medical and 
pharmaceutical goods, the environment, and others. It is hard 
to say which of the regulations numbering 20,000 would be 
liberalized. But we would classify and deal with each case by 
case. 
  [Unidentified attendee] Under the single constituency 
electoral system, do you not think that, in Japan, political 
ideology and policy would be concentrated in a single center? 
  [Noda] That is what the voters will determine. But the 
political parties have become more diversified. I expect that 
the concentration and breaking up of power will be repeated 
several times in the future. It could occur once or twice this 
year. I think the power structure will be settled for the most 
part after repeating such a process. 
  [Kato] Both Japan and the United States are in a transition 
stage in every area of society. A question was raised from the 
floor about the qualities demanded for future leaders in various 
fields. Including that point, I would like to ask the panel's 
opinion. 
  [Buckley] I feel the European view is being listened to 
less and less, both in Washington and Japan. The United States 
and Japan are forming a kind of "new club." The Europeans 
generally take the view that Japan and the United States 
together are unjustly dividing every field. I think this must 
be corrected. To make matters more difficult, Europe is not 
fully united. 
  I draw a somewhat pessimistic conclusion, but Japan and the 
United States seem to ignore what the European countries have to 
say. If they are not careful, Europe could end up gradually 
pushed to the outside internationally and be left there. 
  [Suzuki] Japanese economic policy and the economic system 
have now come to the stage where they must be reformed. The 
fundamental reason for reform is that we have been pursuing an 
economic system and policy of catch-up and pass Europe and the 
United States since the Meiji period. 
  When we did catch up, the high growth period ended and the 
excess savings in the country remained. So the criticism has 
arisen that a too stringently regulated system is not good. 
  There, the move to change began. There are three important 
qualities needed by our leaders concerning economic reform, as 
Buckley pointed out at the beginning: 1) They must have a 
historical perspective, in other words, understand the theory of 
Japanese historical stages. 2) They must able to place things 
in a global setting. 3) They must be economists who understand 
the political field. These are the qualities that are needed 
now. 
  [Takenaka] Japan is still in the most fortunate position in 
the world. In other words, both Russia and the United States 
are facing the situation where they must lower their standard of 
living for the present in order to improve the future situation. 
It is the opposite for Japan: To adopt various policies to 
elevate the Japanese people's standard of living will be 
ultimately beneficial for the world. 
  What we must keep in mind, rather than leadership qualities, 
are the following: 1) We must participate in world issues. 2) 
We must be open-minded to accept the "idea of fairness" by 
societies that are different from ours. 3) We must possess a 
caring mind toward people in different, less fortunate positions. 
  [Noda] Those three concepts can be applied also in the world 
of politics. Especially in the international environment where 
the magnet of East and West does not work, decisiveness and also 
insight would be necessary. 
  [Watanabe] If we could hold the personal income tax at 10 
percent and the business tax under 20 percent, the wealth held 
by the private sector would grow. Deregulation would not be an 
issue. I want to place my hopes in a person who could do such 
things. In the world of education, the quality of a non-local 
currency, in other words, people who can function at any 
university, even overseas, are desired. Also, fundamentally, 
unless we renounce the historical view of the Tokyo Tribunal for 
war crimes, in the long run, we will not have a proper Japanese 
education. 
  [Kato] As for the leader's quality, I just remembered the 
last chapter, the "Golden Person," in Mitchner's novel 
Hawaii. The person who is always open-minded and can 
get along with others from different circumstances is the 
"golden person."

  [Text] At a regular news conference on 16 May, Okinawa 
Governor Masahide Ota referred to his planned visit to the 
United States, which starts from 9 June. He said: "The 
prefectural government is currently trying to get appointments 
for meetings with chairmen of the Armed Services Committees of 
both houses in the U.S. Congress. These meetings will be the 
highlights of my visit to the United States." His remark 
indicates that although he presented petition for the solution 
of Okinawa's bases issue mainly to the U.S. Government during 
his past visits, he would change this. 
  Asked about the results of his past visits to the United 
States, Ota said: "The number of Americans who understand 
Okinawa's bases issue has increased after we put a notice about 
Okinawa in U.S. papers and after we invited influential 
congressmen to Okinawa. At home, the Foreign Ministry and the 
Defense Agency have made official comments on the issue." In 
this way, he noted that the situation surrounding the bases 
issue is improving. 
  Ota has decided to make direct petition to the Armed 
Services 
Committees because he values highly the influencing power of the 
two committees, which have the right to decide on U.S. defense 
budget. At the news conference, Ota stressed differences between 
the upcoming visit and the previous ones. He said: "I would 
like to meet the chairmen of the committees and gain their 
understanding." 
  Meanwhile, concerning a proposal made by Okinawa Development 
Agency Director General Moriyoshi Sato to construct an 
international airport on Okinawa, Ota expressed the hope the 
proposal would be carried out. He said: "There is a plan to 
expand Naha airport over the coast. So, his proposal is 
fantastic." 
  Ota welcomed Sato's proposal, saying: "The Transport 
Ministry is reluctant about expanding Naha airport, claiming the 
airport has enough room. But Mr. Sato is serious about his 
proposal and is raring to carry it out." Ota intends to study 
measures to construct an international airport from various 
angles, including expanding Naha airport over the coast.

  [Text] This year's annual "May 15 Peace Parade" (sponsored 
by the Okinawa Peace Movement Center) kicked off at 0930 (local 
time) on 13 May at three different locations in Okinawa, 
including the Peace Prayer Park in Itoman city and the Nago city 
office. The parade has traditionally been held to appeal for 
the establishment of peace in Okinawa through the removal of 
U.S. military bases. Participants in the parade will continue 
marching until they reach their destination, which is a 
beachside park in Kadena Township where a general rally is to be 
held on 15 May. The event has been held 16 times in the past. 
  A total of about 2,000 participants, including about 800 
from 
other prefectures, are expected to participate in the parade. 
About 5,000 participants are expected to gather at the general 
rally. A ceremony was held at the Peace Prayer Park to mark the 
beginning of the parade for the group of marchers who plan to 
take the southern route starting in Itoman city. There were 
about 400 participants at the ceremony. 
  In a speech greeting the participants, Zenshun Arakaki, 
chairman of the Peace Movement Center, said: "The existence of a 
`secret deal between the Japanese and U.S. Governments for 
bringing nuclear weapons to Okinawa' has been revealed. We have 
learned that the three nonnuclear principles were only a hoax. 
Moreover, the ruling coalition government is planning to enact 
emergency legislation by taking advantage of the issue of the 
DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear weapons development 
program. What we really need is a nuclear inspection of U.S. 
military bases on Okinawa." Arakaki encouraged the marchers by 
saying, "Let us complete our parade." 
  In their speeches, local representatives of various parties 
one after the other stressed the seriousness of the issue of the 
secret deal regarding bringing nuclear weapons to Okinawa. 
Representatives from other prefectures also said: "For Okinawa, 
the postwar period is not yet over. The reversion of Okinawa to 
Japan was a fraud."

  [Text] The government decided on 14 May its basic policy 
for the "ASEAN Regional Forum" scheduled in July. This forum 
will be the first ministerial-level meeting on the security 
issues of the Asia Pacific region. With the major aim of 
building confidence among nations in this region, Japanese 
Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, who will attend this meeting, 
will urge the participating countries to "enhance transparency 
of their military capability." Japan particularly intends to 
call on Southeast Asian countries and China, which are said not 
to be conscious of the importance of transparency, to compile 
"white papers" on national defense affairs. However, since this 
is the first security conference with China and Russia, Japan 
will not hastily seek a conclusion on how to deal with the 
Korean peninsula issue at this conference. 
  This forum will open in Bangkok on 25 July prior to the 
Enlarged ASEAN Foreign Ministers Conference. Apart from the six 
ASEAN nations, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, 
Singapore, and Brunei, Japan, the United States, Australia, 
China, and Russia are among the 18 participating nations in the 
conference. Foreign ministers from these countries will freely 
exchange their views on the security system in the Asia Pacific 
region. 
  Thailand, host country of this conference, proposes to 
discuss the "security situation in the Asia Pacific region." 
The Japanese Government will dispatch Deputy Vice Foreign 
Minister Hiroshi Fukuda to attend a senior working-level meeting 
of the Enlarged ASEAN Foreign Ministers Conference scheduled in 
Bangkok from 22 to 25 May to discuss details of the agenda, 
including Japan's proposal. 
  At the security forum, Kakizawa will make a speech to 
explain 
Japan's basic policy to the participating countries. Japan 
believes that "the Asia Pacific region needs to form a new 
security framework to deal with the situation after the end of 
the Cold War. As a prerequisite to this, it is important to 
build confidence among the countries in this region." Based on 
this idea, he will stress in his speech the need for improving 
transparency of military and defense capabilities of each 
country. Most participating countries, except Japan, the United 
States, and Australia, have not disclosed the actual state of 
their military capabilities. Therefore, Japan will request the 
countries concerned to work out "white papers" equivalent to 
Japan's Defense White Paper. 
  Behind Japan's proposal is the fact that moves to strengthen 
military capabilities are noted in China and Indonesia, and the 
ASEAN nations have also begun to engage in a military buildup. 
  Kakizawa further intends to suggest the following: 1) 
exchange of views on various issues, such as how to cooperate in 
disaster relief and UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO); 2) 
establishing a system to prevent arms proliferation, including 
nuclear weapons, within the region; 3) exchange of views of 
private-sector think tanks dealing with security issues. He 
also plans to discuss Japan's stance that the international 
community should unite in dealing with regional issues, such as 
the alleged nuclear arms development by the DPRK (North Korea).

  [Text] Japanese companies will launch this year many new 
development projects for oil and natural gas resources in China 
and Vietnam, which are shifting from the planned economy to the 
market economy, and also in Russia where the socialist system 
has collapsed. Most projects are handled by general trading 
firms or oil companies. If they succeed in striking such 
resources, Japan will not only be able to reduce its dependence 
on the Middle East for energy supply, but will also profit from 
these projects. Interests of Japanese companies coincide with 
those of the countries concerned, which aim to develop their 
economy by introducing foreign capital after the end of the Cold 
War. On the other hand, some people point out the danger of the 
enormous amount of investment involved and the possibility of 
projects being unprofitable. 
<H5>  Sakhalin </H5>
  Mitsui &amp; Co. Ltd. has been engaged in the development 
of oil 
and natural gas off the coast of northeastern Sakhalin. 
Executive Director Naomichi Suzuki said, "We may be able to 
sign the contract in May." He is now waiting for correspondence 
on the schedule for signing the contract. Mitsui, U.S. 
companies Marathon Oil and McDermott, multinational Royal 
Dutch/Shell, and Mitsubishi Co. Ltd. formed a consortium, and 
initialed the contract for the project "Sakhalin II" with Russia 
in March. About 100 million tons of crude oil deposits and 
about 400 billion cubic meters of natural gas deposits are 
potentially extractable. 
  The total budget for this big project is over 1 trillion 
yen. 
<H5>  Vietnam </H5>
  Last fall, Sumitomo Co. Ltd. was greatly excited at the news 
that "production of 6,640 barrels of oil per day has been 
confirmed." Many international consortia obtained concessions 
and are engaged in oil drilling off the coast of Vietnam. 
Sumitomo's Dai Hung (Big Bear) oil field was the first to 
produce oil. Sumitomo will launch a joint project with the 
Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company and the Malaysian 
Petronas Company to start production this fall. The total budget 
of this project is expected to be 200 billion yen. 
  Nissho Iwai Corporation signed a contract in mid-April for 
development of Thanh Long (Blue Dragon) oil field neighboring 
the Dai Hung oil field. It will begin drilling this summer in 
cooperation with the U.S. Mobile Corporation and other 
companies. Nissho Iwai President Tetsu Nishio expressed his 
pleasure, saying, "Removal of U.S. economic sanctions against 
Vietnam in February facilitated this project." 
  Profits of trading firms from crude oil dealings have 
dropped 
because of cheap crude oil prices. Trading firms now seek to 
survive through oil field development and other operations. 
The Dai Hung oil field alone off the coast of Vietnam is 
estimated to have 400 million to 1 billion barrels of oil 
deposits. Itochu Corporation, Idemitsu Kosan Corporation, 
Marubeni Corporation, Mitsubishi Oil Co., and Arabia Oil 
Corporation have also started their own drilling operations this 
year. 
<H5>  Tarim Basin </H5>
  The Tarim basin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is 
located about 4,500 km away from the Chinese coastal region. A 
consortium formed by Japanese companies obtained concessions for 
three oil fields in this desert area late last year or in 1994. 
  The Sumitomo group plans to prospect oil deposits and 
conduct 
experimental drilling possibly for as long as eight years. The 
Japan Energy group signed a contract in February, and the 
Mitsubishi Corporation group, in March. It is said that there 
are over 10 billion barrels of deposits here, and that the Tarim 
basin has the greatest undeveloped deposits in the world. 
China, which has become an oil importing country, also hopes to 
secure new energy sources indispensable for economic development 
in the future.

  [Text] It was learned on 13 May that the Ground 
Self-Defense Force [GSDF], which is in the process of studying 
the role of the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] in the post-postwar 
period, has formulated the "outline" of a new strategy which 
shifts from "emphasis on the north," in consideration of the 
Russian forces in the Far East, to one that also emphasizes the 
defense of western Japan and the metropolitan area. 
  As the "threat from the north" diminishes after the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the GSDF is being forced 
to reduce personnel, the Ground Staff Office has also focused on 
the significance of the "effects of the situation on the Korean 
peninsula," and the "political and economic center of the 
country" in its review of the strategic role of GSDF divisions 
stationed nationwide. It has also suggested steps to enhance 
mobility, including the creation of a new unit of helicopters 
for personnel transport. 
  Among the 13 divisions stationed all over Japan, the 
downgrading of the Fifth Division (headquartered in Obihiro 
City, Hokkaido) and three other divisions to brigades is also 
being proposed. The above plan is believed to represent the 
GSDF's position in preparation for the Defense Agency's formal 
decision to reorganize the SDF within fiscal 1994. 
  Consideration of plans to reorganize the GSDF gathered 
momentum after former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ordered a 
review of the 1976 "National Defense Program Outline" last 
February. The above "outline" worked out by the Ground Staff 
Office in late April is meant to be a preliminary draft on which 
to base further discussions. 
  The "outline" states that from the standpoint of national 
defense, Japan can be divided into "northern Japan," referring 
to the area north of Aomori Prefecture, "western Japan," 
consisting of northern Kyushu and the Chugoku region, and 
"central Japan," comprising the remaining territory. These 
three regions are then discussed individually in terms of the 
"territorial issue," "effects of the situation on the Korean 
peninsula," and the "location of the political and economic 
center," considering them equally important in terms of national 
defense. This indeed represents a shift from "emphasis on the 
north," which entailed giving priority to frontal deployment in 
Hokkaido, among other things. The "outline" is not premised on 
any specific threat, and in this sense, it is a return to the 
philosophy of the "National Defense Program Outline." 
  Partly owing to the difficulty in recruiting SDF members, 
the 
Defense Agency has already decided to reduce the size of the SDF 
from 180,000 to 150,000. As a concrete step to implement force 
reductions, the present "outline" proposes downgrading the 10th 
Division (based in Nagoya), the 12th Division (based in Shinto 
Village, Gunma Prefecture), and the 13th Division (based in 
Kaita Town, Hiroshima Prefecture), apart from the Fifth Division 
mentioned above, to brigades. It suggests reducing the size of 
these divisions from the present 7,000 to 4,000 or 5,000. 
Brigades have the same functions as divisions although they are 
smaller in size. At present, the GSDF does not have brigades. 
  In the process of determining which divisions to downgrade 
into brigades, the metropolitan area and the Kansai area, which 
are Japan's political and economic centers, and the northeastern 
region and Kyushu, where it is relatively easier to recruit SDF 
members, have been excluded. Likewise, four divisions in 
Hokkaido -- the Second Division (based in Asahikawa City) which 
defends the Soya Strait, the Seventh Division (based in Chitose 
City) which is the GSDF's only armored division, and the 11th 
Division in Sapporo City -- have also been excluded. Candidates 
for downgrading were said to have been selected from the 
remaining divisions according to their degree of importance. 
  Furthermore, the size of infantry members forming the core 
of 
all divisions and brigades will be reduced to a small commanding 
unit during peace time, forming the so-called "core units" 
without rank-and-file members, to implement force reductions. 
  The following steps to strengthen mobility are also proposed 
to realize a balanced national defense strategy: 1) deploying a 
considerable number of helicopters of the 12th Division in 
Gunma, reorganizing this into a "mobile air brigade," which can 
be dispatched to any place in Japan in an emergency; and 2) 
increasing the number of armored vehicles in all divisions and 
brigades. The plan also suggests an upgrading of the reserve 
SDF officers system to staff the core units. 
  In addition, the "outline" also proposes possible 
consolidation and retrenchment of operational bases which have 
become difficult to maintain and manage around bases where GSDF 
divisions or brigades are stationed. It estimates that, of the 
159 bases all over the country, around 40 need to be closed.

<F P=106> [Article by commentator Takashi Tachibana: "The New Cabinet </F>
Was Formed by Stabbing the People in the Back"] 
  [Text] Frankly, the new cabinet has been formed by 
stabbing the people in the back. 
  Had this situation [the formation of the Kaishin 
parliamentary group] been created before the election to 
nominate the prime minister took place, the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] would not have voted for Tsutomu Hata and, 
it follows, there would have been no Hata cabinet. It is 
nothing but a political betrayal to exclude the SDPJ in such a 
manner the moment the election to name a new prime minister was 
over. It is quite understandable that in such circumstances the 
SDPJ left the administration. 
  When Hata was elected prime minister, there was a flood of 
mass media reports describing Hata attractively as "sincere," 
"earnest," "an ordinary person," and "gentle." I wonder, 
however, if it is possible for us to find anything "attractive" 
in his unfaithful attitude. 
  I wonder if he will again make (Ichiro) Ozawa, who controls 
politics from behind the scenes, responsible for all the 
undesirable situations. 
  When asked about the "dual power structure" in which Ozawa 
takes the actual lead, Hata replied, "even an actor is allowed 
to select the scenario." This was an implicit admission that he 
was merely an actor. However, even if the scenario was written 
by Ozawa, Hata must be held responsible for choosing it. 
  I wonder to what extent Hata will perform the scenario 
written by Ozawa. There seems to be no end to Ozawa's program 
to reorganize the political world until all the existing 
political parties are dissolved, and the Taisei Yokusankai 
[Imperial Rule Assistance Association] is built up to carry out 
the Japan reform plan according to Ozawa's scenario. 
  If Hata is going to participate in such a forcible and 
unfaithful reorganization of the political world, and is going 
to take the responsibility for carrying out the Japan reform 
plan, he should immediately discard his image as "an ordinary 
person," and instead adopt an image as "a cunning person," or 
"the follower of a strong man." No matter what kind of a 
cabinet Hata forms, it is inevitable its life will be short. 
Though he may intend to prolong the life of his administration 
by undermining the solidarity of the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] and the SDPJ, I do not want him to cause further political 
confusion by so doing. What the people want is the Diet 
dissolved and a new general election as soon as possible. 
  Japanese politics is apparently facing a historical turning 
point. The wheel of the history should not be turned merely for 
the purpose of political disputes in the absence of the people. 
Now is the time to consult the will of the people. That is the 
only thing we expect the new cabinet to do.

  [Text] The Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] and Japan New 
Party [JNP] agreed on 16 May that in order to solicit the 
cooperation of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in 
Diet affairs, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata should suggest during 
his meeting with SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama on the 
afternoon of 17 May the disbanding of the "Kaishin" group in the 
House of Representatives, the formation of which triggered the 
SDPJ's secession from the coalition government. 
  DSP Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa informed the prime 
minister of this decision by phone. 
  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which forms "Kaishin" 
together with the DSP and JNP, is against the disbanding of the 
group. Depending on Hata's decision on this matter, discord 
among the ruling parties on the issue of whether or not to 
retain "Kaishin" may be aggravated. 
  Since the SDPJ left the coalition, there has been an 
increasing number of DSP and JNP members who support the opinion 
that "the Kaishin issue should be reconsidered with a clean 
slate to search for ways to bring the SDPJ back to the 
coalition." In view of such a mood in their parties, Yonezawa 
and JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka met at the Diet 
building on 16 May. They agreed to ask the prime minister to 
state that "he is willing to consider disbanding Kaishin" at his 
talks with Murayama on 17 May. 
  While the "Kaishin" group has been formally organized, it 
has 
not been functioning at all. Even if the prime minister 
expresses his willingness to dissolve "Kaishin," it is nearly 
impossible for the SDPJ to return to the coalition immediately. 
It is believed that in return for disbanding "Kaishin," the 
ruling parties would like to solicit the SDPJ's cooperation in 
the deliberation on the fiscal 1994 budget, the handling of the 
proposed resolution to dismiss the chairman of the House of 
Representatives Committee on Rules and Administration, the issue 
of summoning former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa (JNP head) 
and his former secretary to testify in Diet, and other matters 
of steering Diet affairs. 
  It has also been reported that during a telephone 
conversation with Matsuoka [on the Kaishin issue], Hosokawa told 
Matsuoka to "listen carefully to what the parties concerned 
think."

  [Text] It was disclosed on 17 May that Democratic Socialist 
Party Chairman Keigo Ouchi said at a meeting held with senior 
members of a religious group in Tokyo in the evening of 16 May 
that "we would like to form a nonpartisan caretaker government 
after approval of the fiscal 1994 budget and resignation of the 
cabinet en bloc." He made this remark as a countermeasure to 
deal with the situation if no-confidence motion is submitted 
against the Hata cabinet. According to a source concerned, 
Ouchi took into consideration the possibility of including the 
Liberal Democratic Party in forming the next coalition 
government. Ouchi reportedly said: "We need to immediately 
approve the bill for redrawing electoral districts for the House 
of Representatives. After that, we can dissolve the Diet and 
hold a general election in either November or December."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Strong Demands Both Domestically and </F>
From Abroad; Concern Lingers That Endorsing Promotional Gifts 
Will Affect the Price of Goods] 
  [Text] The Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is struggling to 
review the regulations for promotional gifts. With the strong 
demand from the United States that the upper limit on 
promotional gifts be sharply increased, the government has 
incorporated a regulatory review in the outline prospectus for 
economic reform of foreign trade that was completed at the end 
of March. There are also those domestically who are seeking to 
have the upper limit raised in response to the increased price 
of goods. Although the FTC is warning of its fear that a 
movement will emerge blaming the cost of promotional gifts for 
higher prices, review of the regulations is on track. If by June 
the government is to adopt a substantive policy in the 
prospectus for economic reform, it will be necessary for the FTC 
to show certainty of judgment. 
<H5>  Deferral for the Long Term </H5>
  "You should review both individual and overall ceilings on 
promotional gifts." Thus did the Keidanren petition for relaxing 
the regulations on promotional gifts in a letter issued on the 
19 April on deregulation in such areas as transportation and 
currency. For example, although credit card companies offer 
promotional gifts to card users based on a point system, because 
regulations governing the upper limit on promotional gifts have 
not been revised for many years, such a service cannot be used 
effectively to promote sales. 
  The FTC is determining the upper limit on promotional gifts 
based on the Promotional Gift Indicator Act. The subjects are 
prizes offered as promotional gifts, such as lottery tickets, 
drawings, and attached promotional gifts that are offered to 
everyone who buys the product. The upper limit for attached 
promotional gifts is 50,000 yen; 50,000 yen for general prizes 
when promotional gifts are awarded in drawings to purchasers of 
products; and 100,000 yen for open prizes offering promotional 
gifts when the entrant does not have to buy the product. 
  The United States has criticized Japan's promotional gift 
regulations as "a way to limit consumer choices" (assistant 
attorney general for antitrust matters in the U.S. Department of 
Justice). It hopes to sell U.S. products by developing sales 
promotion campaigns using promotional gifts when brand names are 
not as well known as those of Japanese goods. 
  The United States is not alone in making the criticism. 
Japanese firms have pointed out that, because many provisions of 
the promotional gift regulations have not been reviewed for over 
30 years, "They are not in step with economic conditions." 
<H5>  Given Current Concerns, Tacit Approval </H5>
  Last year Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways began 
offering free airline tickets for miles traveled on 
international routes as a trump card to halt the drop in 
passenger demand. U.S. and European airlines began this practice 
about 10 years ago, finding it necessary to pursue it in order 
to maintain competitiveness. Although it is feared that this 
service exceeds the 50,000 yen limit for promotional gifts, the 
FTC has adopted a wait-and-see attitude. This results from 
current concern about the fierce competition for passengers on 
international routes as an area of international competition, 
but there is potential in the future for qualitative differences 
in the competitive conditions for awarding promotional gifts. 
  Furthermore, a relatively large segment of the merchant 
community has transmitted to MITI the hope that, "We will see 
the upper limit raised on the offering of promotional gifts such 
as through drawings." The thinking is that because the 
atmosphere in the market place has soured due to the extended 
slump and the Large-Scale Retail Store Law (Large Store Law) 
they want the means to energize consumer interest through 
campaigns such as drawings. 
  Meanwhile, Shiseido has suspended the campaign of 
promotional 
gifts it has had for more than 60 years since the early days of 
the Showa period. The company said, "Consumers are not happy 
with sundry merchandise such as tissues and pouches and, 
therefore, their effectiveness in promoting sales has declined." 
It is difficult to produce promotional gifts that consumers find 
attractive because the upper limit for promotional gifts is 10 
percent of the price of a product in the case of low-priced 
items. 
<H5>  A Difficult Balance </H5>
  Regarding these foreign and domestic demands, the FTC 
counters by saying that, "If promotional gift competition 
becomes intense, the costs will be reflected in prices and the 
consumer will not benefit" (Trade Practices Department). In 
particular, the FTC shakes its head in response to U.S. 
criticism, saying, "U.S. firms will not be the sole 
beneficiaries of deregulation." 
  While Japan's promotional gift regulations do control 
excessive competition in promotional gifts, they leave room to 
be used to some degree as a method of marketing promotion. The 
balance is somewhere between the United States, which recognizes 
promotional gifts in principal, and Germany and France, which do 
not recognize them at all. Therefore, the question usually 
follows of what standard should be used to set the upper limit. 
With the variety of demands the FTC is burying its head in its 
hands, lamenting that "finding a middle ground is extremely 
difficult."

  [Text] Fuji Bank has decided to participate in multilateral 
netting (multilateral settlements) which involves simultaneous 
settlement between foreign banks of credit and debit balances 
that arise in foreign exchange transactions. In July, Fuji Bank 
will contribute capital to the netting agency and will initiate 
transactions beginning in the first part of 1995. Since netting 
reduces the credit risk in the event of a default by one of the 
counterparties to the agreement, some commercial banks have 
moved to sign agreements with U.S. banks, but this is the first 
time that a Japanese bank has involved itself in a multilateral 
agreement. 
  Fuji Bank will be participating in a multilateral netting 
agreement scheduled to begin business in July and include 13 
principal European banks such as Barclays Bank and Paris 
National Bank and the Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank. 
  The plan calls for the 14 banks to jointly capitalize Echo 
(headquartered in London), in the amount of several hundred 
pounds and to deposit 10-20 million pounds with the agency 
necessary for use as security to serve as the netting agency. 
  For example, if Fuji Bank in a transaction with Bank A has 
receivables of $2 million and payables of 500 million yen and 
effects transactions with Bank B for $2 million in payables and 
1 million pounds in receivables, Fuji Bank can use the netting 
system by paying the netting agency 500 million yen and 
receiving 1 million pounds. 
  Even if Bank A should fail, risks can be minimized by 
reducing Fuji Bank's credits as if it had received $2 million. 
  If a bank uses the netting system to offset credits and 
debits, it can reduce its assets. The Bank for International 
Settlements (BIS) is reviewing the possibility of recognizing 
increases in bank equity through such methods of reducing assets. 
  Netting agreements are established in three forms; i.e., 
agreements that cover only one specific branch of a banking 
system, agreements that cover all branches of a bank, and 
agreements that cover several banks. Among city banks, there is 
an agreement between the Bank of Tokyo and the Tokyo branch of 
U.S. Citibank and the agreement which covers all branches of 
Mitsubishi Bank and U.S. Chemical Bank.

<F P=106> [Interview with Toshio Morikawa, chairman of the Federation </F>
of Bankers' Association of Japan, by Jun Wada, editor in chief 
of NIKKEI KINYU SHIMBUN; place and date not given] 
  [Text] On 26 April, Sumitomo Bank President Toshio 
Morikawa became the first official of that bank to assume the 
chairmanship of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan. 
In reference to nonperforming loans of banks, Chairman Morikawa 
said, "We have passed the peak for the occurrence of bad loans." 
He suggested that Japan's financial systems are headed towards 
stabilization. Relative to the public disclosure of bonds whose 
interest payments have been reduced or forgiven, he assumed a 
cautious stance, saying, "They are different from the bad loans 
that are now being publicly disclosed." And, he stressed his 
position that he intends to ask the Ministry of Finance [MOF] to 
review in the spring of 1995 regulations applicable to the 
operation of securities subsidiaries of banks. 
  [Wada] For the time being, huge sums of nonperforming loans 
are the foremost problem of banks, but is there any possibility 
that they will lead to instability in financial systems? 
  [Morikawa] In addition to assuming a flexible posture on the 
use of write-off systems, the MOF's efforts to promote an 
environment favorable to the disposition of bad loans, including 
compilation of an "Administrative Guide for the Nonperforming 
Loan Issue" should have a major beneficial impact. I hear that 
prospects are good for the recognition of sole-bidder companies 
to dispose of collateralized real estate. Sole-bidder companies 
will be of major significance in the disposition of bad loans 
and will have an effect on the liquidity of collateralized real 
estate and on the prevention of further drops in collateralized 
values. 
  [Wada] What do you think of the pending question on home 
financing specialty companies? 
  [Morikawa] The issue will have to be handled in a manner 
which calls for financial institutions to deal with each of the 
home specialty situations. Home financing specialists will have 
to dispose of bad loans and reexamine their future operations. 
  [Wada] What are your views on the disclosure of bad loans? 
  [Morikawa] Disclosures of bad loans by banks were initiated 
in March 1993 based on the report issued by the Financial System 
Research Council's subcommittee in 1992. I am aware of the 
important role played by disclosures in that they enhance the 
transparency of bank operations and that they lead to confidence 
in banks and the stability of financial systems, but we must 
provide sufficient consideration of their effect on the 
maintenance of orderly credit systems. We should verify the 
effects and the regularity of current disclosure actions and 
effect an incremental expansion in the procedure in terms of 
disclosure content and applicable financial institutions. Loans 
on which interest payments have been exempted or reduced reflect 
the premise that the principal will be recovered and fall in a 
category which differs from bad loans which are the subject of 
disclosures at this time. 
  [Wada] Securities subsidiaries of city banks are expected to 
be established within the year, but how should we deal with 
reform of the financial system in the future? 
  [Morikawa] The joint operation of banking and securities 
businesses has just reached its threshold. Fundamentally, such 
joint operations are subject to review in two to three years 
relative to operational restrictions. At present, rigidly 
enforced barriers require a review of many aspects and their 
merits relative to international compatibility and fairness and 
client convenience that were the original goals of joint 
operations. In April 1995, it will be just two years since the 
system reform went into effect. We plan to study and advocate 
changes in the firewall that restricts personnel actions and 
limits services offered by securities susidiaries. 
  [Wada] What do you think of the situation in which loan 
operations which serve as a revenue source for banks have 
declined and attention is being focused on derivatives as a new 
source of revenues and profits? 
  [Morikawa] Growth in the issuance of loans has definitely 
slowed, but this does not reflect a "reluctance by banks" to 
issues loans as indicated by some sources. All banks are working 
to expand loans, but the recession has prevented desirable 
progress. The primary source of bank revenues and profits will 
continue to rest with efforts to expand deposits and loans. On 
the other hand, it is a fact that financial systems are being 
decontrolled and that the management and procurement of 
corporate capital is becoming sophisticated, but banks' foreign 
operations have been expanding as well. Banks' role is to assist 
overall corporate financing. If needs in the area of derivatives 
expand, banks must have the capability to respond to those needs. 
  [Wada] What do you think of the situation in which 
derivatives are traded without accountability on bank records, 
expose banks to the risk of undisclosed losses and could serve 
as a cause of market turbulence? 
  [Morikawa] The main purpose of derivatives is to provide a 
system for managing risk and one's evaluation of derivatives 
depends on his interpretation. However, although they involve 
huge sums and are not cash transactions, there is the one 
problem of being unable to measure the size of the risk. It is 
important to maintain risk control in terms of credit risks 
versus the other party to transactions. 
  [Wada] Can you give us your outlook for the economy? 
  [Morikawa] In addition to public works investments and 
housing construction, signs of improvement can be seen in 
certain segments of individual consumption. However, because we 
have undergone last spring's experience where a rising economy 
was frustrated, we cannot help but become cautious about 
economic assessments. Corporations are negative on capital 
investments and we cannot assume an optimistic outlook on 
individual consumption. It is too early to confirm that the 
recession has bottomed out, as long as the tempo of the recovery 
does not gain momentum. However, we may see somewhat more 
obvious signs of a recovery assuming tax reductions and 
comprehensive economic measures take effect. 
  [Wada] What do you think of the changing interest situation 
including rising long-term interest rates? 
  [Morikawa] Long-term interest rates can be affected by 
supply 
and demand factors for bonds, but in the present situation it is 
hard to think of the economy as having started on the path of 
recovery on a midterm basis. Prices are very stable. I believe 
that there is hardly any reason for rising interest rates. 
  [Wada] Will banks continue to be able to earn margins on 
interest rates? 
  [Morikawa] The reason why banks were able to expand their 
margins until recently is that during the period of declining 
interest, they increased the ratio of short-term funds procured 
on the open market. However, when interest rates are stable, an 
expansion of bank margins is not feasible. 
  [Wada] What do you think of the strong yen in the foreign 
exchange markets? 
  [Morikawa] I am concerned about the effect of the strong yen 
on the economy and trends in interest rates. I feel so because a 
strong yen-weak dollar scenario can lead to a rise in U.S. 
long-term interest rates, a drop in stock prices, and a ripple 
effect on the world economy as a whole. Cooperative intervention 
by Japan, Europe and the United States has resulted in the 
temporary stabilization of the yen, but I hope that we see a 
time when it reaches a point of genuine stability reflective of 
sound economic fundamentals. 
  [Wada] What do you think of the situation in which the yen 
is 
expensive in terms of corporate performance and poses 
difficulties for Japanese businesses? 
  [Morikawa] There will be a major impact not only on export 
industries, but on industry as a whole. Businesses must shift 
their production base to overseas locations and replace domestic 
materials with foreign-produced materials. I am concerned about 
the effects of such shifts on employment and incomes. 
  [Wada] What to you think of the agreement between the 
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications on the postal savings issue? 
  [Morikawa] I express my admiration over the fact that the 
two 
ministries reached an agreement on an issue plagued with a wide 
variance in positions. However, the recently reached agreement 
has problems. The agreement leaves much to be desired from the 
standpoint of the banking industry in ways such as the 1.1 
percent differential in interest rates between ordinary postal 
savings accounts and regular bank savings accounts. We consider 
it to be an interim agreement and believe that talks will be 
reopened at the end of the year to discuss the interest rate 
differential for postal savings. 
  Ordinary savings interest rates should conform to the 
average 
private industry rate and postal savings rates should not be 
significantly higher. Even the Provisional Council for the 
Promotion of Administrative Reform has produced a report stating 
that "government businesses augment private industry 
businesses," and I hope that early action will be taken on a 
modification of the postal savings interest rate. 
  [Wada] Interest rates for floating deposit and savings 
accounts will be decontrolled effective in October. How will 
interest rates be established? 
  [Morikawa] They will be established on the basis of 
individual decisions, but interest rates will be established 
under a competitive climate on the basis of factors such as 
interest levels prevailing in financial markets and the cost of 
procuring funds. Even in this situation, the existence of 
special treatment for postal savings poses a problem for 
private-sector banks in determining appropriate interest rates. 
  [Wada] The Japanese economy is entering a slow growth phase. 
What do you think of a movement to restructure the financial 
industry, once the disposition of bad loans is completed? 
  [Morikawa] Future economic growth will definitely be slower 
than in the past, and the operating environment will change 
because of deregulation, calling for actions responsive to the 
new age. Mergers are one option. Instead of limiting measures to 
the pursuit of advantages derived from operations of a larger 
scale and mergers to assist ailing operations, we'll probably 
see mergers that seek industry and geographical diversification. 
Actions will vary depending on bank territories and assets and 
manager decisions. A multitude of options such as mergers, joint 
ventures, and major reengineerings are possible.

<F P=106> [Article by Katsuto Uchihashi, critic: "Balance Sheet on </F>
Recession and `Hollowing Out'"] 
  [Text] Finished Product Imports Surpassing Exports 
  With the decline of the mining and manufacturing production 
index and the factory shipments index persisting, the recession 
has begun to look even more serious. 
  The recording of this greatest decline (relative to the 
previous month) since the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] began keeping statistics on trends in mining and 
manufacturing production occurred in October 1993. Since then 
neither production nor factory shipments have shown any signs of 
recovering. 
  The perception has collapsed of viewing this recession as a 
process of course correction back to that before the bubble 
inflated, and most industries are being hit directly by declines 
both in their production and in their shipment indices to levels 
far below any theoretical figures. 
  One might be able to see the Japanese economy reverting, in 
scale and strength, back nearly to the levels of 1984, ten years 
ago, and now being headed on its way to even further 
retrogression toward the levels prior to that--those of the 
early 1980's. 
  This year again, most Japanese companies, including the auto 
industry, issued bullish new-year forecasts of performance 
recovery, but one must seriously doubt about the extent to which 
the managers believed in achieving the scenarios they themselves 
had written. 
  Still, in contrast to such pitiful conditions domestically, 
there exists an area where plans are under way to augment 
production facilities across the board and should effectuate 
broad-scale projects for increasing production. 
  It is the Asia-Pacific region, and what is doing it is 
Japanese capital centered on electronics, communications, and 
home appliances. 
  In Malaysia by the end of 1994, electronic parts such as 
variable resistors, tuners, as well as floppy-disc drives will 
go up by 1.3 to five times. And in Thailand, parts for microwave 
ovens and for nonportable VTR's [video tape recorders] will go 
up by 1.5 to two times. Furthermore, in Singapore, projects are 
under way to double computer peripheral equipment, microshafts, 
and so on. Facilities investment to expand the scale of 
production is starting up across the board at local plants 
backed by Japanese capital. 
  From the fact that the number of imported color TV sets has 
for the first time surpassed the number exported (1993), one may 
see at what a rapid pace the transfer of the production base of 
our nation's manufacturing industries is proceeding. 
  It is not only in color TV sets that imports have 
quantitatively surpassed exports. 
  Many of the manufacturers of electronic parts established as 
local corporations are actively pushing the reimportation of 
locally made parts. Not to mention the parts for nonportable 
VTR's, but the scale of increase in finished goods imports also 
reached 50 percent (relative to 1992) in 1993. Compared to the 
30-percent reduction recorded for the exports of these, it is a 
great contrast. 
<H5>  "Technology Transfer" Becoming High Tech </H5>
  The many Japanese-owned local plants are already entering 
their third stage of development. 
  The initial expansion era of the first stage had a goal of 
using the cheap labor power available locally. It was a response 
to the continuing keynote of the high yen, and local plants were 
accorded the role of mere bases for supplying parts for Japan. 
  For electronic parts, however, such a primitive stage is 
long 
past. 
  From Japan's viewpoint, the parts-supply bases have evolved 
into bases for exporting parts to other regions, including 
Japan. The respective production bases were reorganized from an 
initial "development of points" to a "development of areas," and 
they entered into the second stage, that of producing the best 
suited parts in the best suited regions on the most suitable 
scale. 
  Now, in the third stage we are coming into an era in which 
they make the parts locally, Japanese assemblers everywhere 
assemble the products locally, and sell the products locally; 
and at the same time, they export the products to Japan and 
elsewhere. 
  Looking at durable consumer goods, local buying power is 
rising sharply, as seen in China. An age is approaching in which 
the advent of the so-called mass-consumption society can be 
foreseen. The strategy and evolution of assembling locally, 
selling locally or exporting finished products to other regions 
is being advanced by the local corporations themselves. 
  Along with such changes, "technology transfers" to these 
localities are beginning to take complex aspects. 
  Technology transfers from Japanese business can be 
classified 
broadly into five types. One can see the inevitability of having 
to proceed toward progressively higher levels of technology 
transfer. 
  Type 1. Transfer of skills: At local factories 
created by extending capital directly, the processes for making 
things are taught to employees and leaders. Guidance for each 
line is administered by on-the-job training, and when production 
of new parts is begun, knowledge of the broader scope needed for 
plant production is transferred to the local people. 
  Type 2. Sophistication of transferred technology: 
Cases in which transferred technology reaches the stage of 
giving birth to new lines are not rare. Even the same resistors 
as are used for radio-cassette players have become producible 
locally for high-quality hi-fi equipment. Other examples are 
such things as going higher level such as by taking one cylinder 
for a VTR cassette player and going from those for two-head 
machines to four-heads and then on to six-heads. As this 
proceeds, the technology level is approaching high tech. By 
seeking ever higher added value locally, it is starting to give 
rise to successive new lines. 
  Type 3. Local transfer of design and quality assurance 
sectors: Taking up the third stage already discussed, such 
things as the introduction of CAD (computer aided design) 
systems have come to be worked on locally. 
  Aiming for the optimal supply bases for the entire East 
Asian 
region, they need to go not only into product aftercare and so 
gain the ability to provide repair and replacement parts, but 
also to meet ISO (International Standardization Organization) 
levels. 
  By going through such processes, local plants will proceed 
toward higher orders of specific technology. The needed 
technology is brought in from Japan. 
  Type 4. Transfer of "manufacturing processes:" 
This is the formula by which Japanese firms handle the 
manufacturing process up to a certain stage and shift completely 
to local areas certain processes up through finishing the 
product. Japan becomes the supply base for semi-processed parts, 
and the local plants take these and do the finishing of the 
products. Needless to say, know-how for product inspection and 
local transfer of reliability-testing sensors goes with that. 
  Except for special high-level parts technology, the all-out 
transfer of production technologies must proceed in this way. 
  Type 5. Transfer of R&amp;D: At present, transfers of 
research and development sectors occur only in the early stages. 
However, what will come after a unified development of skills 
and technology will inevitably be the completion of a 
"once-through system of making things" which will mean 
localizing the capacity to improve and develop products and 
parts. 
  Japanese firms that assert they are aiming for the shortest 
possible way to reach that goal are growing in number. 
  In the past, if one asked who it was that bore the burden 
for 
types from one to five, it naturally was the midsized small and 
tiniest subcontracting plants for parts within Japan. It is 
already clear what the above described transfer of production 
bases and technology will bring next for them in Japan. 
  By avoiding the subject of industrial hollowing that has 
raised concerns lately, we become unable to discuss Japan's 
economy and business climate henceforth, and the future of 
subcontracted parts industries and, of course, employment. 
  The situation has not changed a bit, either, for any 
discussion of breaking out of "the 1990's slump." 
<H5>  Dilemmas of Technology Transfer and Employment </H5>
  Just as it was for restoring Japan's postwar economy, it is 
valid also for Asia's NIE's [newly industrializing economies] 
and ASEAN nations to accept technology transfer from the 
technologically advanced nations and follow the road to growth 
by using that as a nucleus and improving on it as a way to 
advance. 
  Based on the assumption that NIE's and ASEAN nations will in 
due course be able to overtake and pass the north's advanced 
nations, the thought that conditions for competition in trade 
globally will be equalized will lead to a way for preserving 
fairness and equity in international trade. Conversely, a 
hegemonic strategy such as rejects the principle of equalizing 
the terms of exchange--between the north's industrial goods and 
the south's resources--would eventually come to be boycotted 
strongly by the world. 
  In that sense, for the technologically advanced nations 
themselves, including Japan, working actively for technology 
transfer may be called their international duty. 
  The problem is how should that be advanced in equilibrium 
with the hollowing out of domestic industry? Realistically, it 
comes to the point that one cannot avoid tackling it with a 
broader point of view. 
  In dealing with the knotty issue of technology transfer and 
industrial hollowing, the strategic argument is often made for 
"transferring low tech while keeping the high tech." With that 
in mind, the ultra-optimistic argument is quite glibly put forth 
that "Japanese business can survive by commercializing the 
next-generation technology." 
  As for the first, just as a clash of views has arisen over 
the transfer of VTR technology to China, a strategy of 
distinguishing between low tech and high tech will be rejected 
by the industrial policies of the side accepting the transfers. 
  That the latter idea is too sanguine goes without saying. 
For 
instance, not even the buds of any commercialization of such 
next-generation technology as room-temperature nuclear fusion or 
biotechnology are to be seen. 
  Even if these did come into being as new industries, they 
would not likely be the labor-intensive type of industry; and 
expecting too much of them as a solution for employment problems 
that are anticipated is out of the question. 
  According to predictions by the Sanwa Research Institute, if 
direct overseas investment by Japanese business rises henceforth 
at a 10-percent pace year after year, employment opportunities 
within the nation amounting to 950,000 persons will be lost by 
the year 2000. And, if it rises at a 20 percent rate, employment 
opportunities for 1.26 million persons will disappear, it says. 
  These figures are huge ones surpassing the current number of 
unemployed within businesses in the manufacturing industry. 
Added to employment adjustments responding to the "1990's 
slump," having this much reduction in employment predicted for 
five or six years from now speaks to the peril of the 
unemployment rate in Japan shooting up to an acute level 
exceeding the levels of the United States and Europe. 
<H5>  Production Base for Key Devices </H5>
  What sorts of directions might the strategic decisions at 
the 
level of individual corporations be taking now? 
  It is a question of guarding against hollowing out at home 
as 
well as how to proceed with technology transfer with nations of 
the Asian region. How those choices are made may constitute a 
crossroads that will determine the future of Japanese business. 
  Certain businesses seek to gamble on making their parts even 
more advanced. 
  For the production technology of VTR decks, they have a 
strategy for advanced development of parts whereby a number of 
parts are linked together by integrated circuits, with 
production of the key devices being concentrated in Japan. 
  The advanced technology that puts the cylinder and pre-amp 
into one chip necessitates a general mobilization of high 
technology, such as semiconductor technology and miniaturizing 
and precision processing technology. 
  It is believed that in the regions and nations receiving the 
technology transfers they still have to go some distance to 
reach this advanced technology level. 
  In addition, the added value of this kind of key device 
makes 
up 60 to 70 percent of the VTR deck as a whole. It is said that 
it can be one of the few profitmaking domains within Japan's 
"building of things." 
  This is not to say that the technological fields to remain 
in 
Japan are to be the existing high-tech areas, but that we should 
trim back to such fields as are being newly developed and thus 
to make higher technology possible for more products. 
  It would mean positioning plants within Japan as production 
bases for such new key devices and endeavoring to maintain them 
as places of employment. 
  It can be called an option showing possibilities. In other 
words, Japan--the producer and exporter of finished goods--would 
change into a parts supply base. In this way we would be aiming 
to circumvent reductions in employment opportunities. 
  Still, the businesses involved think that, despite such 
efforts by companies, a shrinkage on the order of one third 
might be unavoidable for employment in the production stage. 
  A part of the stern reality is coming to the fore. 
<H5>  Can We Counter the Big Three? </H5>
  A hardship even worse than in electronics is facing the auto 
industry. 
  The cost advantage of Japanese cars is rapidly being lost in 
the "1990's recession." 
  In this industry the strategy pursued in the 1980's for 
boosting competitiveness faces the contradiction that in the 
1990's it is changing totally into a heavy burden. 
  The competitiveness created in the 1980's by the strategy of 
production of many models but small quantities, short cycles, 
and high value-added was transformed in the 1990's when it ran 
into the sharp drop in demand. That is because the strategy that 
gave birth to competitiveness had become the cause of totally 
adverse effects. 
  The Big Three of the United States, our international 
rivals, 
have begun moving to transfer their production strongholds to 
Mexico, and the European companies have gone into eastern Europe 
and Spain. Needless to say, it is a strategy of again recovering 
a powerful cost advantage by a shift of production bases. 
  To counter such global mobility of production strongpoints, 
Japanese makers also may have to move to shift into the 
Asia-Pacific region. But it is clear that this option is not 
something of a kind that is easily managed. 
  As distinct from electronics, the cultivation of parts 
industries for autos in the Asia-Pacific region will face many 
obstacles. 
  One is that the policies of the local governments toward the 
auto industry have still not settled on whether or not they 
should give priority to domestic production. Hence, the basic 
conditions differ from the expansion of the Big Three into 
Mexico. 
  On the other hand, bringing the technological level of local 
parts makers up to that of domestic keiretsu subcontractors 
would take far too much time. And yet, to advance capital aborad 
with domestic subcontractor firms, the production scales in the 
local areas are far too small. 
  The 1980's strategy of moving into an area by somehow 
building a beachhead centering on the knockdown (local assembly) 
formula is about to go against them here, too. 
  Yet, as mentioned before, domestic subcontractors' ability 
to 
cut costs further has already attained its limit. One symbolic 
example of this is the failure (last October) of Taiyo Kogyosho, 
which had been a primary subcontractor for Toyota Autos and 
supply source for Toyoda Steel Works (pressed parts). The 
company's order volume had fallen to one third of its peak time. 
  The number of failures in steel and metals located in the 
central region has become 2.4 times that of the same period last 
year. But, this, too, is but a phenomenon showing an example of 
the distress the auto industry is experiencing. 
  At the subcontracting stage--the base of the pyramid--the 
reality of hollowing out is now close at hand. 
  With all this going on, it is not conceivable that Japanese 
auto makers will easily have available the approach of 
recovering cost competitiveness vis a vis European and the U.S. 
cars by seeking to transfer such production bases in the way 
that the electronic parts industry and other assemblers have 
done. Here, too, a new peril has arisen for Japanese industry. 
The "1990's slump" has begun to show another of its new sobering 
aspects.

<F P=106> [Article by Tadahide Ikuta, journalist: "Record of `The Man </F>
Who Manipulated the Prime Minister' and Ambitions That Persist 
Despite the Abortive Attempt at Welfare Tax Legislation"] 
  [Text] Capabilities That Cause Minister To Be Termed 
Chief Clerk 
  The upheaval caused by the "national welfare tax" initially 
announced during Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's press 
conference at 0100 on 3 February 1994 brought sudden notoriety 
to Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito of the Ministry of 
Finance [MOF] who should normally function as a behind-the-scene 
staff adviser. His newsworthiness reached a level where 
television covered scenes such as his commute to work and 
leisurely walks. 
  Several days after the "national welfare tax" proposal was 
withdrawn, one of his friends remarked to Saito, "You've been 
made out to be the nation's consummate villain." In response, 
Saito, as if he were enjoying his notoriety, remarked, "They're 
using my name in vain and creating a ruckus." 
  That particular friend comments that Saito was ridiculing 
tendencies in Japanese political and government circles to blame 
Saito for the commotion over the "national welfare tax." 
  Saito is a capable bureaucrat labelled as "a Ministry of 
Finance vice minister of the decade." Once, when former Prime 
Minister Takeo Miki served as minister for MITI [Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry], Administrative Vice Minister 
Shigeru Sahashi exercised his influence and was sarcastically 
referred to as "Minister Sahashi assisted by Vice Minister 
Miki." However, conditions at the MOF are worse. Reference is 
now made to Minister Hirohisa Fujii through remarks such as, 
"Vice Minister Saito and Chief Clerk Fujii." In this connection, 
mention should be made of the fact that Saito is the one who 
asked Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa to appoint Fujii 
as minister of finance. Moreover, Saito has not limited himself 
to the MOF; he exercises his unlimited influence over other 
ministries and agencies as well. 
  The MOF is referred to as the "government agency among all 
government agencies" and has produced a number of powerful vice 
ministers over the years, but Saito is probably unprecedented in 
the extent of coverage he has won from the mass media and the 
attention he has enjoyed as a powerful bureaucrat. The question 
is, why is it that Saito creates such interest? What kind of 
person is he? First, let us examine the role played by Saito in 
connection with the recent "national welfare tax" which served 
as the reason for intimate pursuit of Saito by television 
cameras. Let us retrace the events of that particular episode. 
<H5>  A "Close Ally" Who Arranged Public Works Projects </H5>
  Saito was appointed as administrative vice minister of the 
Ministry of Finance in June 1993. Events subsequently taking 
place included the split in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
a general election which resulted in the loss of a majority by 
the LDP and its perennial control of government, and the birth 
of the coalition government. Appointment of Saito to the 
position of vice minister was coincidentally timed with the 
collapse of the "1955 structure" of the LDP government. 
  Just as the end of July approached and it became clear that 
a 
non-LDP coalition would be formed, Saito remarked, "When there 
is a lack of political leadership, bureaucrats should conduct 
themselves with confidence." In reality, various ministries and 
agencies that had endured the oppression of LDP zoku Diet 
members for an extended period, suddenly conducted themselves as 
if they were freed of all constraints. Comparatively speaking, 
the MOF made itself prominent in this respect over all other 
ministries and agencies. 
  Upon learning of the results of the general election, the 
MOF 
immediately approached Ozawa and Hosokawa. Ever since the 
implementation of the consumption tax, the MOF had referred to 
itself as "the Takeshita bureaucracy" or "God, Buddha, Mr. 
Takeshita," but it abandoned all such references and rallied 
around the new government once the latter was formed. Needless 
to say, Saito was the individual who took the initiative in this 
respect. 
  Initially, Saito had a long talk with Ozawa. He also spent 
many nights with Hosokawa in discussing government policy 
concerning financial and monetary matters, while partaking in 
highballs. 
  During those discussions, Saito emphasized the critical 
condition of Japan's financial situation. As of 1993, the 
accumulated national debt, including construction bonds and 
government deficit bonds, totaled about 184 trillion yen. 
Moreover, it is now certain that fiscal year 1993 deficits will 
be of record proportions for the first time in 11 years since 
recording a 2.5 trillion yen deficit in fiscal year 1981. 
  Ever since his appointment as vice minister, Saito has vowed 
repeatedly, "We shall under no circumstances issue government 
deficit bonds." That being the case, Saito devoted much time to 
deter Hosokawa's cherished view that, "A cut in income taxes is 
the foremost, orthodox measure to be taken in order to counter 
declining consumer sentiment." And, according to MOF officials, 
Saito stressed, "As a means of coping with the aging of society, 
we have no choice but to alter direct and indirect tax systems. 
Thus, we cannot avoid an increase in the consumption tax rates." 
  An increase in the consumption tax has been a long-cherished 
desire of Saito as well as other bureaucrats of the MOF. 
Fortunately, that desire also reflected the cherished view of 
Ozawa who exercises authority "equal to that of secretary 
general" of the coalition government. In other words, the view 
has been that "The current 3-percent consumption tax should be 
increased to 10 percent which would fall in the mid-range rates 
currently existing in Europe and the United States. 
Concurrently, we should reduce income and residence taxes by 
one-half." 
  Moreover, Saito and Ozawa are "dedicated allies" of sorts. 
The two have been friends ever since Saito served as a budget 
officer in charge of public works projects. It was the 
"international contribution tax" concept, created during the 
fiscal year 1992 budget compilation phase, which inspired the 
creation of firm ties between the two individuals. That concept 
was formulated by Saito who was then serving as director of the 
Budget Bureau and Ozawa who had just left the position of LDP 
secretary general and was serving as acting chairman of 
Keiseikai [Takeshita faction]. Eventually, the "international 
contribution tax" was abandoned because of opposition from 
within the LDP, but that defeat brought the two closer together. 
  Saito visited Ozawa immediately just before the 
establishment 
of the coalition government because he firmly believed that 
"Ozawa would certainly have a sympathetic ear for the MOF 
position concerning the critical financial situation." 
  Further, his intent was to push through a consumption tax 
rate increase before the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] 
and Komeito--which had opposed such an increase during their 
opposition party days--could block the move as members of the 
new coalition. In exchange, he offered Ozawa and Hosokawa the 
MOF's support for the coalition government. 
  Furthermore, Saito assumed leadership in establishing an 
unprecedented cooperative stance of the MOF in support of the 
coalition government. For example, although the ministry has 
embraced the "absolute rule" of compiling the budget before 
yearend, the ministry cooperated with the "Ichiro Ozawa-Yuichi 
Ichikawa position" of placing priority on "political reform." 
<H5>  Scenario Which Began To Fall Into Disarray </H5>
  However, postponement of the budget processing work to 1994 
met not only with resistance from Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura, but also with strong objections from 
Director Kyosuke Shinozawa and Budget Bureau officials of the 
MOF. But, according to MOF officials, "About that time, rumors 
were rife that Shinseito action would be initiated to relieve 
Shinozawa from his position and Saito pushed through the 
postponement." 
  On the other hand, from around 23 December 1993, Saito 
accompanied by MITI Administrative Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano, 
visited the four economic organizations, national newspapers, 
news correspondent firms, the Rengo labor organization, and 
influential politicians of the governing and opposition parties 
to explain the "economic plan" compiled jointly by the MOF and 
MITI. 
  The main features of the plan included: 1) implementation of 
a several trillion yen income tax cut effective January 1994, 2) 
implementation of an offsetting consumption tax increase from 
the current rate of 3 to 7 percent 15 months later effective 
April 1995, 3) cut in premium consumption tax for standard-size 
cars from 4.5 percent to 3 percent, and 4) cancellation of the 
special 2.5-percent special corporate tax established during the 
Gulf war. 
  It was unusual for top officials of the MOF and MITI to 
conduct themselves in such a manner reflective of anticipation 
for a "national welfare tax" even before an agreement had been 
reached within the coalition parties on tax reform, and, above 
all, even within the MOF, only a small group of officials had 
any knowledge of the "economic plan." 
  Reportedly, Hiroaki Taya, chief of the General Affairs 
Division of the Budget Bureau, was the author of the economic 
plan. Others participating in its preparation were limited to 
Shinozawa, director of the Budget Bureau, Takeshi Omura, 
secretary general, and Takashi Sugii, chief of the Secretarial 
Dividion, Minister's Secretariat of the MOF. Even Director 
Tadashi Ogawa of the Tax Bureau that exercises jurisdiction over 
tax systems had not been informed of the plan. It is rumored 
that Ogawa protested to Saito, "I am not aware of such plans," 
and that the confrontation between Saito and Ogawa became very 
ugly. 
  In any event, Saito was working assiduously toward his goal 
of "being absolutely against government deficit bonds and for 
raising consumption taxes." However, the scenario of attaining 
tax reform in January as conceptualized by Saito began to fall 
into disarray. The political reform-related draft bill passed 
the House of Representatives but was stalled in the House of 
Councilors for some time and finally rejected. An agreement at 
the top level between Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, president of the 
LDP, resulted in the approval of the draft bill on 29 January, 
but debate on tax system reform was completely shelved. That was 
only two weeks before the Japan-U.S. summit and deadline for 
processing the budget. 
  Moreover, sentiment among the coalition parties including 
Shinseito had changed to favor "separation of tax decrease and 
increase measures and an early income tax cut. The idea was to 
assume a leisurely pace in considering ways to offset the tax 
cuts. That position seemed to have been reinforced by Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's remarks of 29 January in which he said, "I 
have no intention of increasing the consumption tax," while on 
the next day on the 30th in Takamatsu City [Kagawa Prefecture], 
Takemura said, "We will offset tax cuts with government deficit 
bonds. For the time being, we will not insist on increasing the 
consumption tax." 
  Naturally, Saito reacted violently to such statements 
because 
after he had cooperated with the coalition government by 
suppressing opposition within the MOF for six months, the 
scenario which he had envisioned would fall into complete 
disarray if the outcome assumes a delay in the implementation of 
an increase in the consumption tax and the issuance of 
government deficit bonds. 
<H5>  Saito Effects a Massive Withdrawal of Cohorts </H5>
  Saito utilized a dedicated "hot line" with Ozawa to attempt 
a 
desperate recovery in his position. A secret conference took 
place between Ozawa and Saito in the evening of the 31st at a 
posh restaurant in the Akasaka district of Tokyo. At that point, 
Ozawa concluded that it would not be advisable to disregard 
Saito and make an enemy out of the MOF. Further, he figured 
that, although the SDJP was voicing opposition to the opening of 
rice market and the political reform draft bill, it would agree 
with the coalition party plan in the final analysis and remain a 
part of the coalition government even if it resists "concurrent 
tax decrease and increase measures," at which time he, Ozawa, 
would push through his position. 
  It was at that point that the two put their heads together 
and formulated the "national welfare tax" concept. Reportedly, 
Hosokawa is the one who made the "decision" on the title of the 
proposed tax system, but it would not be in error that the two 
were responsible for deciding on a "three-year implementation of 
the tax cuts" and a "rate of 7 percent for the newly proposed 
tax." Next, at 1000 hours, 1 February 1994, Saito accompanied by 
officials of the MOF visited Hosokawa at the Prime Minister's 
Residence. A final presentation and explanation was made before 
the prime minister. 
  In the afternoon of 2 February, Prime Minister Hosokawa made 
his first presentation of the "national welfare tax" concept at 
a coalition party representatives' conference held at the Prime 
Minister's Residence. Secretary General Wataru Kubo of the SDPJ 
voiced objection to the concept at the meeting, but others 
voiced approval. Prime Minister Hosokawa was entrusted with the 
authority to make a decision, thus leading to the predawn press 
conference of 3 February by Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
  This article will not cover the details of what ensued. The 
SDPJ opposed the concept while threatening to leave the 
coalition government and Takemura and his party Sakigake, Japan 
New Party, and the Japan Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] 
sympathizing with the SDJP position forced Prime Minister 
Hosokawa to "withdraw the national welfare tax concept." 
However, at that point, MOF forces led by Saito effected a mass 
exodus from the scene under the assumption that "residual 
aspects of the matter should be disposed of as political issues." 
  On 8 February, the issue was settled with a decision to 
"provide for implementation of a 6 trillion yen tax cut" and 
"provide for legislation by the end of the year under an 
agreement by the coalition parties to cover an offsetting tax 
package." However, although Saito came through in one piece, the 
final decisions reflected complete destruction of his position. 
  In essence, the reason for his complete defeat is reflected 
in the final outcome which calls for issuance of government 
deficit bonds, issuance of such bonds at a rate 22.1 percent 
above initially conceived targets for fiscal year 1994 in 
initial fiscal year plans and a gross government deficit bond 
balance exceeding 200 trillion yen. 
  Moreover, there was an outburst of criticism on the ruling 
and opposition parties regarding the strategy played out by 
Saito in the final stages of the negotiations. According to the 
25 February edition of the SHUKAN ASAHI, Hiroshi Kato, chairman 
of the government's Tax Commission, condemned Saito by saying, 
"Mr. Saito cuts costs relentlessly, saying he does so for the 
sake of the people. He conducts himself in a manner typical of a 
member of the Budget Bureau who exercises authority over the 
national budget. The recent incident is reflective of a 
situation where an official tries to carry the ball by himself. 
He had failed to build a consensus and assumed an overly 
optimistic outlook. One wonders about the quality of his 
performance as vice minister in handling the recent affairs." 
  This statement can probably be regarded as criticism of MOF 
Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito's "unbridled" actions. 
When one looks at his past performance, one will readily note 
the conspicuous presence of arbitrary actions and secrecy of 
Saito. 
  Former minister of the MOF and current LDP Policy Research 
Committee Chairman Ryutaro Hashimoto has said, "I think this is 
a case which the situation was created by the excessive actions 
of a bureaucrat, especially an administrative vice minister, 
because of a weak cabinet. However, those actions will probably 
become a source of future problems. For one thing, there is the 
issue of what disposition should be made of the disruption in 
relations between Vice Minister Saito and the Tax Bureau and the 
government's Tax Commission. Another issue concerns policy 
coordination within the ministry. 
  "In prior times, the vice minister never played an obvious 
role in handling tax system matters. This time around, 
coordination of policy among Budget, Financial, and Tax Bureaus 
was handled with the vice minister playing a very conspicuous 
role, leading to probable objections in this respect." 
  Although he is referred to as "a prominent vice minister of 
the decade," everyone agrees that Saito disgraced himself in his 
recent fiasco concerning the "national welfare tax." But MOF 
officials say, "Although Saito is surrounded by a prevailing 
atmosphere of trepidation, Saito himself displays even stronger 
determination to excel in his job." 
  The question is, how will he extricate himself from his 
current predicament? It is said that Saito is "unyielding," and 
"tough in the face of adversity," and one can easily understand 
his high-handed methods, if one examines Saito's upbringing. 
<H5>  Intellectual Family Including Siblings Who Are Academics </H5>
  Saito is 58, having been born in 1936 in former Manchuria 
(northeastern sector of China). 
  His father, Yoshito, served with the Research Division of 
the 
Manchurian Railways and had once served as a subordinate of 
Hozumi Ozaki, former ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter, who was arrested 
and executed in connection with the "Sorge incident" of that 
period. In this connection, we should note that Ozaki had 
transferred from the status of a contract employee of the 
Fumimaro Konoe cabinet to a contract employee of the Manchurian 
Railways' Research Division. 
  Saito has referred to his father as being a "member of the 
left wing in those days" and overheard his father say at the end 
of the Pacific War that it was "good that Japan had lost the 
war." 
  In 1948, when Saito was 12 years old, his family evacuated 
from the former Manchuria and returned to a Japan occupied by 
General Headquarters of the Allied Supreme Command. Yoshito 
established family life in a two-story house located in the 
Suginami ward of Tokyo. A classmate of Saito at the private 
Seijo Middle School recollects that his father was operating a 
small import-export firm. The classmate recalls that the family 
maintained a relatively affluent lifestyle and had an electric 
phonograph which was rare for those days, and that classical 
music such as that of Shubert could be heard from the family 
home. Saito's family had three siblings all considered 
intellectuals. His older brother Ichiro teaches French at the 
Tokyo College of the Arts, and his younger sister also teaches. 
<H5>  Referred to as "Homeless" in His Middle School Days </H5>
  However, although the family's lifestyle was comparatively 
affluent, Saito's clothes were always in terrible shape. A 
former classmate at Seijo Middle School remarks, "Saito was 
referred to as a `homeless child.'" It was a teacher who once 
said that his clothes are always in shambles and he walks in a 
very sluggish manner, just like a homeless child." 
  Saito advanced from the Seijo Middle School to the Tokyo 
metropolitan-operated Shinjuku High School. Before World War II, 
Shinjuku High School served as a prep school for many students 
who aspired to enter the Japanese Naval Academy and projected a 
chic, open, and free atmosphere, but Saito again projected an 
image that was far from "stylish." A former female high school 
classmate comments, "Saito would have looked better in a pair of 
hip boots. I still have recollections of his thick glasses." 
  Even today, old photographs do not project Saito as having 
been stylish. He was far from being urbane, but rather rough and 
uncouth. 
  However, in the world of MOF bureaucrats, especially those 
of 
the senior bureaucrat rankings, special emphasis is placed on 
scholastic records as a student. Among MOF bureaucrats, there 
are many talented individuals who "graduated with top standings 
from the Law Faculty of Tokyo University" and who achieved "top 
rankings in the government entrance examinations." Let us take a 
look at Saito's grades at Shinjuku High School. 
  According to a high school classmate, "Shinjuku High School 
is a prep school for many students entering well-known colleges 
such as Tokyo University. However, Saito was not of the 
valedictorian genre. Needless to say, he was a superior student, 
but ranked only 10th or 20th in his class. Only once, just 
before graduation, he ranked third on one of the tests. But that 
was probably a case where he put forth a special effort for his 
final exams." 
<H5>  "Densuke's" Mahjong Career of 40 Years </H5>
  He, then, took entrance examinations for Tokyo University, 
but failed. He attended Surugadai Prep School and passed in his 
second challenge at the entrance examinations, winning 
acceptance at the Category I Liberal Arts Faculty at Tokyo 
University. 
  It appears that Saito applied himself considerably after 
gaining entrance to Tokyo University. He chose civil law as a 
specialty and attended seminars conducted by Ichiro Kato (former 
chancellor of Tokyo University). Kato recollects impressions of 
Saito's student days, in stating, "Four or five members of my 
seminars who graduated in 1959 joined the MOF. Saito did well 
academically and spoke up in class frequently, but all of the 
students did well. My recollection is that he was one of the 
group." 
  Tokyo University professor Akira Yonekura who graduated from 
Tokyo University and entered the MOF together with Saito, but 
resigned from the ministry in his second year, recalls, "I was 
with the MOF for two years, but my social dealings with Saito 
were almost nonexistent and I do not have any definite 
recollections of any conversations with him." 
  It appears that Saito did not perform in a conspicuous 
manner 
as a student at Tokyo University. 
  Life at home was imbued with considerable freedom. At the 
MOF, Saito is known by the nickname of "Densuke," a monicker he 
acquired as a result of his love for mahjong and his habit of 
exclaiming "Den!" when concluding a game. His mahjong playing 
dates back to his student days at Seijo Middle School and there 
were times when he would invite his friends over to play the 
game overnight into the early morning hours. It is said that his 
father, Yoshito, would merely watch the games with a smile 
stretching from ear to ear. 
  According to a middle school friend, "Saito was an easy 
mahjong opponent. He was especially easy to kid when he began to 
lose and he would become upset making it easy to anticipate his 
next move because he would aim for the more valuable pieces. It 
was easy to win a game with him as long as you made him angry." 
  Saito, who was raised in a home with a liberal atmosphere, 
did not "dedicate himself to his studies" and exercised interest 
in whatever matter that caught his fancy at a particular moment. 
He once was deeply attracted to movies and he wrote an article 
titled "Mukden Record" about the situation in Manchuria before 
his family evacuated from that country and sent it to a literary 
coterie magazine for publication. He even joined the school 
chorus and sang as a first tenor. He also played a leading role 
in the theatrical department. During his high school days, he 
already held the second degree rank in the go game; he now holds 
the fifth degree rank. 
  Even today, no matter how busy his work becomes, Saito 
manages to find time for go or become engrossed in a mystery 
novel. 
<H5>  "Sketch of Married Life" During Honeymoon Days </H5>
  Saito exercises considerable flexibility in his lifestyle, 
but when it comes to relations with people, work methods, or 
thought process, he is a completely different person. He allows 
no flexibility whatsoever and is a model of integrity. Among his 
middle school and high school friends, there are more than just 
a few that refer to him as "hardheaded." 
  During his Shinjuku High School days, Saito was a member of 
the student council. It was during the time when the "Bloody May 
Day Incident" took place and there was a heightening leftist 
mood. However, Saito separated himself from such left wingers. 
One of his fellow council members recall Saito's activities, in 
saying, "I served with Saito on the student council, but if he 
joined a council meeting, it was impossible to hold a 
discussion. That was because he would dampen discussion on a 
variety of topics by saying, `I question whether this or that 
topic is an item which should be tabled at meetings of the 
student council!!' There were several council sessions which 
were terminated without any meaningful discussion because of his 
presence. Thus, others in the council meetings would whisper 
among themselves that `We'll accomplish nothing today,' whenever 
Saito appeared at the meetings. In his case, he would refuse to 
alter his positions." 
  Saito, in essence, could not remain contented unless he made 
a statement. However, in contrast to his days at Shinjuku High 
School, it was very difficult for him to play the role of a 
"controversialist" at Tokyo University. One classmate of Saito, 
who sat near Saito during lectures and who graduated in the same 
class, comments, "Mr. Saito would often speak up even during 
lectures. He wouldn't hesitate to express his opinions. However, 
the professor would cut him down to size. After the exchange he 
would have the habit of sitting down with an expression of agony 
and mumble, "Oh. If that were the case, I should have kept my 
mouth shut." Certainly, it was a case even from those days that 
he would charge ahead without considering the consequences." 
  We have examined Saito's student life by concentrating on 
his 
activities during his days at Shinjuku High School. In the final 
phase of this review, we will introduce replies to several 
questions Saito sent to a publication issued by the journalism 
club formed by fellow classmates at Shinjuku High School and 
published eight years after graduation targeted for fellow 
students of the same graduating class under the title of 
"Tsurezure Shimpo" (collection of essays on married life of 
former fellow classmates). In this connection, noteworthy is 
that his wife Keiko was a classmate at Shinjuku High School. She 
is a specialist in china-painting and has translated and 
published a specialty book on chinaware painting techniques 
which was originally written in German. 
  [Question] Where did you go on your 
honeymoon? 
  "Personal secret." 
  [Question] What were the events leading to 
matrimonial love? 
  "That is difficult to explain." 
  [Question] How does the wife evaluate the 
husband? 
  "Perfect. At times he is a fear-inspiring, 
strict husband, at times he is a gentle sweetheart unchanged 
from his younger days, and at times he acts like a young kid 
when he frolics around with his eldest daughter Yoshiko who is 
married to an MOF bureaucrat." 
  [Question] What is your evaluation of your 
wife? 
  "Perfect and faultless. (This is an untrue 
statement. He is always complaining about something. Signed 
Keiko.)" 
  [Question] Have you ever had a husband-wife 
argument? 
  "There's no reason for arguments." 
<H5>  Convictions Cultivated in Germany </H5>
  Saito graduated from the Law Faculty of Tokyo University and 
was employed by the MOF in 1959. He was initially assigned to 
the General Affairs Division of the Budget Bureau. In those 
days, the best of a newly hired group would be assigned to the 
Secretarial Division or Overall Coordination Division of 
Minister's Secretariat and the second-tier group would be 
assigned to the Coordination Division of the Budget Bureau. This 
means that Saito was handicapped in his initiation as a 
government employee in aiming for the position of administrative 
vice minister which is the highest position attainable by a 
career bureaucrat. The individual in the same group who was 
considered to be the prime candidate for achieving that career 
goal was former Director General Masaaki Tsuchida of National 
Tax Administration Agency who currently serves as president of 
the People's Finance Corporation. 
  Two years after joining the ministry, he was assigned to 
regional positions such as the Financial Division, Kinki 
Regional Taxation Bureau, and in 1962 he was assigned to the 
Financial Division, Kinki Local Finance Bureau. Even in 
connection with these mid-career assignments, the 
best-performing officials remain in assignments at ministry 
headquarters, meaning that Saito fell further behind in career 
advancement prospects. Later, in 1965, he was given his first 
overseas assignment with the International Tourists' Promotion 
Association in Frankfurt, Germany. 
  After completing a 40-month tour in Germany, he was assigned 
as assistant to the director, Legal Section, Budget Bureau. It 
was from that point that second-tiered Saito began to perform in 
a conspicuous manner. Hideyuki Aizawa (currently LDP Diet member 
and former administrative vice minister of the MOF) was then 
serving as deputy director of the Budget Bureau and whenever 
Aizawa would disagree with a draft document prepared by Saito in 
the Legal Section, the latter would remark, "Aizawa's comments 
are akin to saying that white is black," creating an episode 
which was reflective of his personality. 
  Then, in 1970 he was assigned as assistant budget officer of 
the Budget Bureau serving as a chief auditor of construction 
projects. Serving under Yoshihiko Yoshino, then functioning as 
program and budget officer (currently president of the Japan 
Development Bank and former administrative vice minister of the 
MOF), inspired the beginning of an intimate relationship between 
the two. Yoshino progressed through the positions of deputy 
director, Budget Bureau; director, Budget Bureau; and 
administrative vice minister, and is now powerful enough to be 
considered as "leader in MOF circles," but throughout that 
period he consistently gave recognition to Saito's abilities and 
developed him into a "budget expert." 
  Subsequently, Saito progressed over an elite course 
including 
assignments as assistant chief of the Coordination Division, 
Budget Bureau; and assistant to the chief First Funds Planning 
and Operation Division, Financial Bureau. In 1976 he was 
assigned as councilor in the Japanese Embassy, West Germany, 
where he served again for three-plus years. Takeshi Nakai, 
professor of Seijo University, who happened to be leading a life 
of academic research in Bonn about the same time and who was a 
former classmate of Saito at Shinjuku High School comments on 
Saito's lifestyle in Germany by saying, "Mr. Saito was very good 
with the German language. He had a good vocabulary and spoke the 
language fluently. However, he was serious and inflexible. After 
he learned that we were former fellow classmates, his mannerisms 
changed and relaxed a little, but only to the extent that he 
would remark, "We've really aged mutually," and finally left 
Germany without cracking a single joke. He was very 
business-like in his contacts and would limit them to bare 
essentials. It was as if he had built a fortress around himself." 
  And, in that assignment, Saito learned much from his 
exposure 
to work with the West German central bank known as the 
Bundesbank. The lesson learned here was that the Bundesbank was 
so "stubborn" that its conviction concerning restraints over 
inflation which threatened the livelihood of German citizens 
would not be altered under pressure exercised over the central 
bank by the German Government or members of the G7 nations. 
<H5>  Distrust Rising to Extremities </H5>
  Saito must have strengthened his conviction based on the 
experience gained at that time that all moves such as political 
and foreign pressure must be "obstinately" resisted and rejected 
in order for the MOF to avoid financial failure of a nationally 
destructive nature. 
  Saito returned to Japan in 1979 and was assigned as budget 
officer in charge of programming, a position which was once held 
by Yoshino whom he respect. The position was referred to as the 
"staff headquarters of the Budget Bureau." It was the time when 
the government was dedicated to implementation of administrative 
and financial reforms recommended by Toshio Doko's Provisional 
Research Council on Administrative Reform report, Saito quickly 
dedicated himself to work on spending cut plans. He first 
classified spending into the three categories of general 
expenditures, national debt servicing costs, and local tax 
allocations and established goals for cutting general 
expenditures. He introduced reduced ceilings for the first time 
relative to budget estimates submitted by the various ministries 
and agencies along with reduction goals for each budget officer. 
  MOF officials, who were subordinates of Saito, recall events 
of the time by commenting, "The decisions made were certainly 
unprecedented and questionable as to feasibility in view of past 
practice. The reason we subordinates of Saito were able to 
overcome the resistance of the various ministries and agencies 
was that Mr. Saito was so "obstinate" as to be unmovable." 
  Saito's performance as a budget officer in charge of 
programming earned him the title of "budget expert" and a high 
appraisal of his capabilities in and out of the MOF. 
  Subsequently, Saito successfully treaded a career path as 
budget officer in charge of construction and public works 
projects; chief, Coordination Division, Budget Bureau; and, in 
1986, deputy director of the Budget Bureau. 
  About that time, the rise in the value of the yen 
accelerated 
following the Plaza Accord of September 1985, the economy 
deteriorated sharply primarily in the export industry sector and 
the Japanese economy fell victim to a recession instigated by 
the rising value of the yen. The then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro 
Nakasone and cabinet members concerned with the economy such as 
Kiichi Miyazawa, minister of finance; and Hajime Tamura, 
minister of international trade and industry, strongly 
petitioned the MOF to implement a large-scale economic stimulus 
package. 
  In response to such moves, Saito beseeched Miyazawa not to 
take excessive economic stimulus action and visited concerned 
agencies to explain his position. However, in the final stages, 
a 4.3 trillion yen package envisioned by Saito was suddenly 
increased by 700 billion yen. At that point, Saito was summoned 
to the office of Yoshino who had become the ministry's 
administrative vice minister and asked angrily, "Are you folks a 
bunch of traitors?" 
  Saito was probably struck by an indelible impression of 
those 
angry words. However, he continued to play a key role in the 
Budget Bureau and subsequently as director general of the 
Economic Planning Agency, director general of the MOF, and 
director of the Budget Bureau, he espoused "sound financial 
management" and "stubbornly" resisted the politicians but was 
always overruled by politicians who were incapable of 
conceptualizing anything beyond winning elections. 
  The foregoing situation existed clearly as a result of 
"political" influence exceeding the authority of the MOF based 
on 38 years of long-term control by the LDP. Saito's distrust of 
politicians had reached extreme heights. Eventually, in June 
1993, he was appointed as administrative vice minister, but his 
distrust of politicians continued to grow. 
  Moreover, Saito' distrust toward insiders of MOF bureaucrats 
was increasing. He had taken an especially dim view of budgeting 
bureaucrats who were supposed to represent a pool of elite 
ministry officials. 
  Those individuals were supposed to be handpicked from among 
those who had excelled academically as well as professionally, 
were assumed to be smart and faultless, and widely known with 
broad personal connections with principal officials in political 
and government circles. Yet, Saito distrust them because there 
were only a few bureaucrats who would deal with financial crises 
at the risk of their personal careers. 
  From Saito's perspective, it appeared that such elitists 
were 
condoning the wanton requests of the various ministries and 
agencies at budget assessment time and taking a condescending 
attitude toward politicians. 
<H5>  Considered by Politicians as a "Sluggard" </H5>
  One former administrative vice minister of the MOF who 
exercises considerable influence over MOF personnel matters 
spoke with strong emotions when Saito was appointed to the 
position of vice minister, in saying, "Saito does not fit the 
mainstream type in the budget area and is a freak. I am amazed 
at his appointment as vice minister." 
  In reality, Saito was completely different from the typical 
elitist budget bureaucrat, when viewed from the way he handled 
his work or approached people from his younger days. Perhaps, it 
is a case where Saito's very existence could be labelled an 
antithesis to the typical budget bureaucrat. There's even the 
view that Saito took the initiative in conducting himself 
deliberately in such a manner. 
  Budget bureaucrats are frequently invited to banquets and 
golf by politicians, other ministries, agencies, and local 
government agencies. Budget bureaucrats who received such 
invitations would handle them with finesse. However, Saito 
avoids banquets and golf invitations. 
  Even if he couldn't avoid and attended one, he would 
suddenly 
announce, "I must attend a meeting. [Please execuse me] I am 
pushing for time," and leave only to return to his office to 
enjoy a session of go. 
  When once asked by a close bureaucratic associate about how 
one might turn down an invitation to a banquet, Saito 
nonchalantly replied, "Even if invited, the thing to do is fail 
to appear. Repeat that approach two or three times and the other 
party will cease to extend invitations." 
  His resolute attitude was also displayed in his work. When 
consulted by politicians and officials of the ministries and 
agencies, he would rarely make an attempt to avoid the issue by 
answering, "Let me consider the matter," as is often done by 
Budget Bureau elitists. He would take a clear-cut negative or 
positive stance by saying, "I'll take action," or "That's not 
feasible." 
  Politicians who have had dealings with Saito evaluate him as 
follows: Kozo Watanabe, acting secretary general of Shinseito, 
says, "MOF bureaucrats are considered politely insolent, but 
Saito ranks a step higher and is arrogant and insolent." 
Ryutaro Hashimoto says, "I have had dealings with `Densuke' 
ever since he served as a budget officer. He is stolid and a 
sluggard. In contrast to the knowledge retained on a mental 
basis, he lacks the power of expression. He assumes the attitude 
that "Knowledgeable people will comprehend," his position. 
However, he has an aspect which lacks maturity and proves 
himself to have a measure of appeal when he accidentally makes a 
mistake." Shizuka Kamei, LDP diet member and former chariman of 
the LDP Political Affairs Research Council, says, "He is lazy, 
clumsy, `nondescript as a steer in the dark,' and has no 
noteworthy aspects whatsoever. He makes no attempt to be 
selective with strategies when dealing with issues and 
approaches issues head-on, but when he is overruled by politics 
and loses a battle, he assumes a nonchalant attitude." Junichiro 
Koizumi, LDP diet member and former minister of post and 
telecommunications, says, "He is unaffable and blunt. However, 
he is an essential individual filling a "thankless role" in the 
MOF. 
<H5>  "Politics of Fear" Exercised Through Personnel Assignments </H5>
  Saito also differs from other elite MOF bureaucrats in the 
way he addresses subordinates. Once Saito explains his policies 
to his subordinates, he does not become involved with details. 
And he assumes complete responsibility. Once a subordinate 
submits a paper to him, he does not "nitpick" like many other 
superiors. Reportedly, he asks for a briefing on the main 
points, counts the number of pages and applies his personal seal 
of approval. Another aspect which appeals to his subordinates is 
that Saito takes the initiative in appearing at concerned 
offices to conduct personal negotiations. He does not utilize 
procedures in which he delegates such negotiations to 
subordinates or engage in consensus building among concerned 
agencies. 
  And, for the sake of "sound financial management," he did 
not 
hesitate to go out of his way to provide complete backing to 
subordinates who had to deal with politicians, other ministries, 
and agencies. That was the way he treated his subordinates. 
  At the present time, members of the "Saito clique" in the 
MOF 
who were evaluated and later rewarded through preferred 
assignments by Saito include only the following four 
individuals: Takeshi Komura, director general; Yoji Wakui, 
director general, Economic Planning Agency; Hiroaki Taya, chief, 
General Affairs Section, Budget Bureau; and Takashi Sugii, 
chief, Secretarial Division. 
  As is seen in the events surrounding development of the 
"national welfare tax," Saito uses only these four individuals 
on important issues. It is a "clique" that undisputably crosses 
seniority lines and represents "confidant politics." 
  With respect to the foregoing situation, LDP Diet member 
Hakuo Yanagizawa, who was two years junior to Saito in the MOF, 
expresses strong criticism, saying, "Saito has concentrated his 
important assignments to subordinates who just happened to 
handle public works projects at the Budget Bureau. It is unusual 
that an individual who took such an approach would be assigned 
to the position of vice minister. When viewed from the potential 
for the ministry as a whole to demonstrate its maximum 
capabilities in the future, Mr. Saito's personnel practices 
leave much in doubt." 
  Needless to say, considerably strong backlash and aversion 
exist not only among budget bureaucrats but other ministerial 
bureaucrats in reaction to that situation. However, it is very 
difficult to resist the "Saito clique" which exercises complete 
control over personnel authority through the positions of 
"administrative vice minister, director general, and chief of 
the Secretarial Division." Some MOF officials refer to the 
clique as representing "politics of fear." 
  In any event, Saito has established personal control over 
the 
MOF which was previously governed by traditional budget group 
bureaucrats. However, that Saito system is not only the target 
of intraministry criticism but a system with many weaknesses. 
  First, Saito's tenure as administrative vice minister will 
be 
limited to one or two years at the most. 
  Another weakness is that the initial ministry appointment 
years of the "Saito clique" are 1959 for Saito, 1963 for Komura, 
1964 for Wakui, 1968 for Taya, and 1969 for Sugii and cover a 
number of years. 
  Moreover, the four members of the "Saito clique" were 
organized into a group only because of the strong personality of 
a "clique leader" known as Saito. Relations among the four are 
delicate and once Saito leaves office, breakup of the "clique" 
is considered unavoidable. There is no way that a huge 
organization such as the MOF in charge of financial and monetary 
affairs can be managed with a small group of five individuals. 
<H5>  Similarity With Internal Turmoil in MITI </H5>
  Saito is well aware of the weak point concerning the Saito 
system. In the meantime, we witnessed the collapse of the "LDP 
structure established in 1955." Saito must have thought now that 
the LDP has surrendered control of the government and I am a 
vice minister, if I don't grasp this opportunity, another chance 
for tax reform will probably not arise for some time. 
  Then, as mentioned earlier, assuming the leadership, Vice 
Minister Saito himself mobilized the "Saito clique" and charged 
full speed ahead for the sake of "opposing issuance of 
government deficit bonds and supporting an increase in the 
consumption tax." 
  As a result, although he has survived in one piece, he faced 
complete defeat and the situation in which the mass media 
directed a barrage of criticism for his unbridled head-on 
charge. Even after the "national welfare tax" was withdrawn and 
a decision was made for a tax cut and issuance of government 
deficit bonds, Saito held a press conference in which he assumed 
a firm stand indicating that there was still room for a 
"simultaneous increase and decrease in taxes." However, since 
the whole issue gave birth to a deep split among the coalition 
parties, the future prospects of such a concept are completely 
obscure. 
  On the other hand, individuals such as Eiki Watanabe, 
director of Planning and Research Bureau, the SDJP Central 
Committee, takes a firm stand in questioning the status of the 
MOF itself, in saying, "Recent handling of the `national welfare 
tax' indicates that bureaucrats have encroached upon political 
territory. I believe that this issue will become a very critical 
policy matter within the coalition parties." 
  Saito will probably continue to maintain a firm position in 
handling future problems. But the question is what will happen 
otherwise within the Ministry of Finance. That skepticism is now 
being voiced within the ministry. 
  Certainly, "absolute opposition to the issuance of 
government 
deficit bonds and an increase in the consumption tax rates" were 
"long-cherished desires" of the MOF and no one within the 
ministry criticizes Saito who fearlessly fought for those 
positions. Among young bureaucrats, the overwhelming majority 
take the view that, "We are deeply impressed with the fact that 
Vice Minister Saito handled the issues fearlessly." 
  However, when it comes to the procedures and methods used by 
Saito in handling the recent issues, we see a different picture. 
We must take the view that Saito's arbitrary actions, secrecy, 
and coercive methods calling for a conspicuous role for the 
"Saito clique" in disregard of the traditional organizational 
structure have, as previously mentioned in a statement by 
Hashimoto, chairman of LDP Political Affairs Research Council, 
left deep scars within the MOF. 
  In this connection, we can point to a similarity with the 
incident leading to the removal of Masahisa Naito, director of 
the Industrial Policy Bureau of MITI that developed into a major 
event at the end of 1993. 
  The "Naito incident" was instigated in connection with the 
retirement of Administrative Vice Minister Tanahashi of MITI in 
reaction among MITI officials to his high-handed methods of 
managing the ministry. 
  Similar to the position taken by Saito, Tanahashi had 
harbored strong dissatisfaction with the elitists who had formed 
the mainstream element of MITI in the past. 
  And, as soon as he was appointed vice minister, just like 
Saito, Tanahashi assumed leadership and forged full-speed ahead 
in winning approval of 10 trillion yen in August 1992 and 13 
trillion yen in 1993 for emergency economic measures. 
  Once Tanahashi left office, however, criticism erupted 
against officials considered part of the Tanahashi regime such 
as Naito, director of Industry Policy Bureau, who had 
collaborated in high-handed management of the ministry. And the 
true facts of the "Naito incident" reveal the intervention of 
Minister Hiroshi Kumagai of MITI who was appointed to that 
position in connection with a change in government. 
<H5>  Undesirable Connections With an Unnamed Magazine </H5>
  During that time, mystery documents exposing Tanahashi's 
"scandal" were repeatedly circulated. Saito is widely regarded 
within the ministry for not having any "selfish motives." 
However, there is no lack of the viewpoint that his greatest 
point of vulnerability is the "RONSAI" incident. 
  The "RONSAI" incident originated with a round table 
discussion sponsored by Jiro Kamiba, publisher, of the RONSAI at 
his office between a large number of bureaucrats and top 
officials of industrial firms under their jurisdiction. Through 
that process, Kamiba used the influence of bureaucrats to extort 
huge sums of money from businesses. Reportedly, MITI assumed 
responsibility for the incident, leading to the resignation of 
Kosuke Yamamoto, director of the Industrial Policy Bureau. 
  However, it was the then-Budget Bureau Director Saito who 
gave a speech as the principal guest at Kamiba's wedding on 28 
July 1991. Saito has never been mentioned in the RONSAI 
magazine, but it is a well known fact among bureaucrats that he 
was an intimate friend of Kamiba. 
  Now, the question is, what will happen in the case of the 
Ministry of Finance? 
  Currently, the "Saito clique" exercises complete control 
over 
those who hold any personnel authority, and unlike MITI, the MOF 
operates an efficient personnel management program. As long as 
Saito remains as vice minister, intraministry discontent would 
not surface. However, when it comes to the time for Saito to be 
relieved of duties from the ministry, criticism over the "Saito 
clique" will probably surface just as it did in MITI. In fact, 
individuals marked as leading and second contenders as a 
replacement for Saito as vice minister include Budget Bureau 
Director Shinozawa and Tax Bureau Director Ogawa, respectively, 
who are both known as typical "conservatives." If Saito takes 
action that would cause any of these two individuals to be 
passed over, there would be an all-out rebellion by 
"conservatives" who represent the overwhelming majority. 
Further, if the LDP should regain control of the government, 
there is the possibility that conservatives will retaliate for 
the interim shift within the ministry to support Ozawa. 
  Saito has dedicated all of his energies to the realization 
of 
"sound financial management." However, it is questionable 
whether bureaucrats following in his path will appreciate the 
work which he did. Perhaps, just as they say that it will take 
at least 10 years for MITI to recover from the residual effects 
of the "Naito incident," Saito's actions may leave a long-term 
legacy of "complications." It appears that, contrary to Saito's 
wishes, the day is nearing when "conservative" elitist 
bureaucrats whom he dislikes so much will regain authority.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of remarks by Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok </F>
Tong at an interview with NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN President 
Takuhiko Tsuruta in Singapore on 16 May; by Yasufumi Watanabe 
from Singapore] 
  [Text] The Future of China's Economy 
  Economic development will continue in China. China needs 
basic social infrastructure, such as airports, power plants, 
communications facilities, ports, and roads. As development 
gets under way, the consumer market will also grow. 
<H5>  China's Military Threat </H5>
  I think it is but natural for Southeast Asia to feel that 
China is a threat. As economic development progresses, there is 
concern that economic power may be transformed into military 
power. Our strategy is to promote economic interdenpendence. 
That way, the neighboring countries will also come to 
understand China's actions. 
<H5>  Membership of Vietnam and Myanmar [Burma] in ASEAN </H5>
  First, nations wanting to become members of ASEAN will have 
to sign a treaty of peace and cooperation. If Vietnam becomes a 
member of ASEAN, it will also have to join the ASEAN Free Trade 
Area (AFTA), and be obliged to open up its market. The 
appropriate time for membership will have to be decided through 
discussions between the two sides. Right now, we do not have a 
specific target time in mind. 
<H5>  Relations With Taiwan </H5>
  I cannot comment on whether I have met with Taiwan President 
Li Teng-hui today (16 May). Singapore and Taiwan have good 
relations in trade, shipping, and aviation. We also have 
defense ties. 
<H5>  Confrontation Between Asia and Western Countries on Human </H5>
Rights 
  I am against linking this to economic issues. Of course, 
human rights issues are important. The advanced nations of the 
West tend to put emphasis on individual rights. We give more 
importance to the right of the people to live as a collective. 
This needs to be discussed at an appropriate venue, such as a 
human rights forum. Trade has to be tackled separately. 
<H5>  NAFTA </H5>
  There has not been any formal invitation for the ROK and 
Singapore to join the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA). However, we welcome the willingness to make NAFTA an 
organization embracing the whole Pacific region, including South 
Korea and Singapore. The important thing is that the United 
States will not only be concerned with Mexico and Chile, but 
will also take East Asia across the Pacific into consideration. 
Of course, it would be a problem if NAFTA only takes in 
Singapore and the ROK and then closes its doors. We will 
welcome NAFTA if it is an open organization aimed at reducing 
trade barriers. The important thing is to open its doors also 
to other Asian nations. 
<H5>  The Era of U.S. Disarmament and Asian Security </H5>
  We need to ask the United States to continue its military 
presence in Asia. Two great powers, Japan and China, exist in 
Asia. If the United States withdraws from this region, the two 
sumo wrestlers may start their fight in the Asian arena. We 
hope the United States, Japan, and China will continue to 
maintain a balanced coexistence with the other Asian states. 
<H5>  U.S. Policy Toward Asia </H5>
  The unofficial Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
conference summit in Seattle last year, by itself, shows the 
importance the United States attaches to Asia. I have no 
complaints about such a geopolitical strategy on the part of the 
United States. However, when it comes to how things are 
actually done, the United States does not completely support the 
policies of Asian countries. (From the letter of Assistant 
Secretary of State Winston Lord), we understand that, at least, 
a senior U.S. official thinks that something has to be done 
about problems between the United States and Asia. 
<H5>  Japan's Contribution to Asia </H5>
  The important thing is for Japan to continue its own 
economic 
growth. China and Vietnam, two economies which have been closed 
until recently, are now trying to join the world economic 
framework. Japan, together with ASEAN, can help these two 
countries by providing investment. This way, our region can 
achieve significant growth in the next 20 to 30 years. 
<H5>  UN Sanctions Against the DPRK </H5>
  Japan and China's persuasion can be very effective. North 
Korea derives substantial income from Japan, and China provides 
the DPRK with fuel and power plants. China has the veto right 
in the United Nations. It is necessary to first make China 
understand that the imposition of economic sanctions is the 
appropriate weapon.

  [Text] Ten active Opposition MPs and seven former MPs have 
been suspected by the United States of involvement in the 
narcotics trade and three have been denied entry visas to the 
US, Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri told the Cabinet yesterday. 
  A Cabinet source said Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong said 
the three MPs denied visas still sat in the House. He named one 
of them as Chat Phatthana Party MP for Chiang Rai Mongkhon 
Chongsuthamani. 
  Mr Mongkhon could not be reached yesterday for a statement. 
  The U.S. Embassy refused comment on the allegation against 
Mr 
Mongkhon. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong's revelations came as the Cabinet discussed 
at length the drug allegations against Chat Thai MP for Nakhon 
Phanom Thanong Siriprichaphong. 
  An Interior Ministry source said the U.S. suspicions that Mr 
Mongkhon was involved in the drugs trade and the refusal to 
grant him an entry visa was also mentioned in a letter sent from 
the Foreign Ministry to the Interior Ministry yesterday. 
  The Foreign Ministry said in the letter that the U.S. had 
asked Thailand to arrest Mr Thanong and send him to that country 
for trial. 
  The ministry said the U.S. had also informed it it had 
denied 
an entry visa to Mr Mongkhon on suspicions he had been involved 
in the narcotics trade in the U.S. under similar circumstances 
to Mr Thanong. 
  Mr Mongkhon's visa request was denied in March. 
  The U.S. said some people had sought information about Mr 
Mongkhon, but its only reply had been "no comment", the Foreign 
Ministry stated in its letter. 
  The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, when asked about this matter 
yesterday, declined comment. 
  Mr Mongkhon is known widely in his home province as "Sia 
Lek". 
  He is a former close aide to Narong Wongwan, former leader 
of 
the now-defunct Samakkhi Tham Party, who was also denied an 
entry visa by the United States for similar reasons. 
  An elder brother of Mr Mongkhon is now serving time in jail 
after being sentenced to death on drug charges in April 1992. 
  Mr Mongkhon, 48, was elected to represent Chiang Rai in 
1983, 
1986, 1988 and 1992. He served as secretary to the agriculture 
and cooperatives minister in 1990. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong also told the Cabinet he was ready to 
testify 
before the House Committee on Parliamentary Affairs concerning 
this matter tomorrow. 
  The Cabinet yesterday considered legal points to decide 
whether Mr Thanong could be sent to the United States for trial. 
  Four laws were taken into consideration -- the Extradition 
Act of 1929, the International Cooperation on Crime Act of 1992, 
the Thai- U.S. extradition treaty of 1990 and the Narcotics 
Suppression Act of 1979. 
  According to the U.S. indictment, Mr Thanong was involved in 
smuggling marijuana between 1977 and 1987. 
  This means Mr Thanong cannot be sent for trial in the US 
under the extradition treaty. 
  According to the Narcotics Suppression Act of 1979, crimes 
which took place abroad cannot be tried in Thailand. The 
Narcotics Suppression Act, which was amended in 1992, also 
cannot be enforced retroactively. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said after the Cabinet meeting 
it was still unclear whether Mr Thanong could be sent to the US. 
  He said the Juridical Council had been asked to make 
recommendations. The council will also study the possibility of 
having Mr Thanong undergo trial in Thailand. 
  The source said Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut told 
the Cabinet the evidence against Mr Thanong lacked weight if he 
was tried in Thailand. 
  He said consideration must be given to whether the U.S. 
indictment against Mr Thanong could be used as evidence. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong also admitted the local evidence against the 
MP was insubstantial. 
  The Interior Ministry has decided it cannot arrest Mr 
Thanong 
and send him to the U.S. because the alleged crimes were not 
committed in Thailand. 
  The decision follows a meeting yesterday between Permanent 
Secretary Ari Wong-araya and his deputies, Chaiwat Hutacharoen 
and Chaloem Promloet, said the source. 
  The source said Thailand had been asked to send Mr Thanong 
to 
the U.S. under an extradition treaty between the two countries 
signed in 1990. 
  An alternative was to send him to a third country which has 
an extradition treaty with the U.S. as Washington realizes the 
extradition of Mr Thanong is not possible under the Extradition 
Act of 1929. The Interior Ministry based its decision on this 
act. 
  The Foreign Ministry also informed the Interior Ministry in 
its letter that 10 Americans suspected of conspiracy with Mr 
Thanong had been sentenced to jail.

  [Text] Bangkok, May 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu remained optimistic Tuesday about North 
Korea's nuclear crisis despite news that Pyongyang already 
started unloading from its nuclear reactor, saying next North 
Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue could open early next month. 
  "If the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) judges 
that 
the situation is not serious, even if it was improper for North 
Korea to start the nuclear rod discharging process without IAEA 
presence, the next North Korea-U.S. high-level talks will open," 
Han told accompanying South Korean reporters after his midnight 
arrival here. 
  "The high-level dialogue, in that case, is likely early 
June, 
although there is still possibility that it may open late this 
month," he said as he arrived at the second stop of his 
Southeast Asian tour. 
  North Korea had said it had to start removing the fuel rods 
from its 5mw reactor in Yongbyon by itself out of technical 
necessity. 
  Han referred to "the line" that separates whether this 
removal process has gone far enough for South Korea, the United 
States and the IAEA to declare an end to diplomatic negotiation 
and take the matter to the U.N. Security Council. 
  This line, he said, remains uncrossed as long as North 
Korea's activities so far at the reactor have not destroyed 
chances of IAEA's random selection and safekeeping of the fuel 
rods for measurements sometime later. 
  "The entire mood of the international community will change 
if North Korea has crossed this line," Han told reporters. 
  "I believe that even China will react negatively if such 
event occurs," said the foreign minister. 
  The IAEA will ultimately decide whether Pyongyang has stayed 
within this boundary, he said. 
  The agency's inspection entered Pyongyang on Tuesday via 
Beijing for a week-long check of North Korea's controversial 
nuclear program. 
  The team will come out of North Korea mid-way through the 
inspection if it finds North Korea in violation of safeguards on 
the nuclear reactor, he said. 
  "This entire issue of fuel rod discharging is entirely 
different in nature of the problem. So far, North Korea was 
charged with not doing something it is supposed to do. But the 
changing of the rods is about North Korea doing something it is 
not supposed to do. It's that much more serious," said Han. 
  Asked about North Korea-U.S. Working-level contact on the 
nuclear problem, he said Seoul and Washington will be able to 
get a sense of where the situation stands on the fuel rods while 
the IAEA is inside North Korea. 
  "If the IAEA report is positive, North Korea and the United 
States could make contacts although they don't necessarily have 
to be working-level meetings," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Bangkok, May 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's direct 
involvement in Asia's first regional security dialogue is 
negligible, but the forum is nevertheless a matter of keen 
interest for Seoul officials including Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu. 
  The six members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Thailand, Singapore -- sit down with their seven "dialogue 
partners," including South Korea and five other neighbors, for 
the first time in July to address their common security concerns. 
  There is no telling where this dialogue, named "ASEAN 
Regional Forum (ARF)" will go, but it is certainly a 
symbol-laden beginning in a region where no such dialogue 
channel ever existed, mainly due to complex conflict of 
political interest, the vestige of the cold war and gap in 
historical and economic development history. 
  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, currently 
visiting Bangkok which hosts the first ARF July 25, called the 
forum more symbolic than substantive at this point. 
  But he sees this as an important impetus for sub-groupings, 
what he described as sub-ARF. 
  For instance, senior officials from Northeast Asian 
countries 
-- South Korea, Japan, the United States, China and Russia -- 
may decide to talk amongst themselves on their security issues 
before reporting to the ARF, Han said. 
  "By having something like the ARF, the region has a growing 
chance of engaging in multilateral regional security dialogue," 
he said. 
  Attesting to South Korea's interest in the forum, much of 
Han's meeting with Thai leaders here Wednesday focused on 
exchange of opinions on the future of the ARF, its relations 
with APEC. 
  The birth of ARF had more to do with competition with APEC 
Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) rather than consensus 
of needs. 
  ASEAN has long functioned as the leader organization in Asia 
until APEC came along in 1989 and took the spotlight in economic 
affairs of the region. 
  Unwilling to let go of the spotlight, ASEAN members braved a 
new initiative by tackling security agendas. 
  Last year, 18 nations including ASEAN members, their 
dialogue 
partners and five guests agreed in July to launch ARF. 
  South Korea had said that it welcomes such initiative and 
promised full participation in the discussion process. 
  Han had always said Northeast Asia needs security talks of 
its own, ideally in the form of mini-Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). 
  "Our participation in the ARF is more symbolic than anything 
else -- symbolic in that we are taking part in this region's 
initiative," explained Yu Pyong-u, director-general of Asian 
Affairs Bureau at the South Korean Foreign Ministry. 
  "But our true security interest lies with Northeast Asia," 
he 
said. 
  "The ARF would certainly be a good precedent, it would tell 
us how we can work in a separate channel in Northeast Asia, how 
we can complement it to ARF," said Yu.

  [Text] Bangkok, May 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu holds series of talks with Thai leaders 
Wednesday, discussing economic and security issues of the region 
and mustering support for Seoul's position on North Korean 
nuclear controversy and support on its bid for non-permanent 
seat on the U.N. Security Council. 
  Han, here on his second stop of Southeast Asian tour, meets 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and calls on King Adunyadet 
Phumiphon before centerpiece talks with Thai Foreign Minister 
Sunsiri Prasong in the evening. 
  On the economic front, Thai leaders are expected to ask 
active advancement by South Korean businesses and more 
investment. They are likely to point out the trade imbalance 
between the two countries. 
  Two-way trade totaled 2.3 billion U.S. dollars last year 
with 
Seoul taking 1.2 billion dollars in profits. 
  Han's aides said much of the meetings here will deal with 
regional rather than bilateral issues, especially with Thailand 
chairing this year's Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) post-ministerial conference. 
  Agendas include exchange of opinions on latest political 
developments, the future of ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) which 
opens for the first time this year, and the future of 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and its relationship 
with ASEAN, the aides said. 
  Han's key points will include briefings on North Korea's 
nuclear issue and getting Bangkok's support form Seoul's 
non-permanent membership in the U.N. security Council for 
1996-1997.

  [Text] Bangkok, May 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea sought 
Thailand's cooperation Wednesday in strengthening ties with 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in its bid to get 
actively engaged with the region. 
  Visiting South Korean foreign minister, here on the second 
stop of his Southeast Asian tour, met with Thai Prime Minister 
Chuan Leekpai for talks on regional issues covering ASEAN, its 
relations with Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the 
regional security dialogue that opened for the first time this 
year, Han's aides said. 
  Han expressed hopes of giving a boost to Seoul-Bangkok 
relations when Chuan visits South Korea next month, the aides 
said. He explained the latest developments on North Korea's 
nuclear problem with emphasis that the situation is not just a 
regional concern but an international one that threatens world 
stabiliity. 
  The foreign minister sought Thai's active role in mediating 
South Korea's involvement with ASEAN as Bangkok plays 
chairnation to this year's ASEAN post-ministerial conference 
July 26-28, the aides said. 
  Chuan explained Thailand's "constructive engagement policy" 
aimed at improving relations with the three Indochinese country 
-- Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia -- and its efforts to establish 
the "baht economy" that would also incorporate Myanmar [Burma]. 
  South Korean officials said they wish to connect to these 
countries as well economically through Thailand. 
  The two leaders touched on Seoul-Bangkok economic relations 
with Chuan noting the trade imbalance in South Korea's favor. 
  Bilateral trade tallied at 2.3 billion U.S. dollars last 
year 
with South Korea pocketing 1.2 billion dollar surplus. 
  Chuan urged South Korean businesses to more actively enter 
Thai market and to make more investments as part of efforts to 
balance these trade figures, the aides said.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said Thailand is 
entitled to make comments about Cambodia, and confirmed 
Thailand's policy of non-involvement. The prime minister said 
it is impossible to end the conflict in Cambodia through 
fighting, which would worsen the situation. He urges that 
diplomatic means be used to solve the problem. The prime 
minister also confirmed Thailand's policy of non-involvement. 
  [Begin Chuan recording] We have the right to make our 
opinion known, but we have no right to carry out actions in 
their country. We are entitled to make comments -- whether we 
support or do not support any options. We the Thai people, as 
we already had an experience, we realize that it is difficult to 
solve national problems by making war. The problem would worsen 
and great damage would be done to the nation, making it 
difficult to restore law and order in a short time. We 
therefore believe that any problem should be settled through 
political and diplomatic means, which is more appropriate. [end 
recording] 
  Concerning Cambodia's repeated accusations of Thailand, the 
prime minister said it is the responsibility of the Foreign 
Ministry and the Thai Government to clarify things to it.

<F P=106> [By Marisa Chimprapha] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh -- The Thai Ambassador to Phnom Penh, 
Sakthip Krairoek, yesterday called on Cambodia and the world at 
large to recognize the suffering Thailand has had to face as a 
result of conflicts inside Cambodia. 
  Sakthip said wide criticism had been leveled at Thailand for 
its alleged support of the Khmer Rouge, but critics seemed to 
ignore the fact that Thai people had been badly affected. 
  The envoy was referring to criticism by Cambodian prime 
minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. 
  The Cambodian government recently appealed for financial 
support to enable it to finally crush the Khmer Rouge, the 
Maoist group under whose reign of terror more than 1 million 
Cambodians died in the 1970s. 
  Thailand's responded to Cambodia's latest request for 
international support by saying it would be wrong for other 
countries to supply arms to either side in the long-running 
Cambodian civil war. 
  The U.S., Australia and France are considering Cambodia's 
request for assistance. However an informed source yesterday 
said no written request had been sent to the governments of the 
three countries. 
  Prince Ranariddh said Thailand's opposition to the request 
is 
tantamount to interference in Cambodia's internal affairs. 
  Sakthip said: "We are an immediate neighbor of Cambodia. The 
continued fighting in Cambodia has seriously affected Thai 
villagers along the border. Increasing the supply of weapons to 
Cambodian troops would certainly increase the suffering of Thais. 
  "Does the world community know about the deaths of innocent 
Thais and the damage caused to Thai property along the border 
when the Cambodians are fighting. Other countries only seem to 
be aware of the allegation that Thailand supports the Khmer 
Rouge," he said. 
  Sakthip said that Thailand has every right to express the 
opinion that the supply of more weapons to Phnom Penh would 
prolong the military confrontation. 
  High-ranking Thai officials, including the military, have 
voiced strong opposition to the request, saying the weapons 
would be sold across the Thai border by the ill-disciplined 
Cambodian government troops. 
  "Does Prince Ranariddh know about the Thai suffering. And if 
he knows, does he care?" said Sakthip. 
  Despite Thailand lodging numerous complaints with the 
Cambodian foreign ministry, Phnom Penh continued to ignore the 
plight of Thai villagers. 
  "That's why Thailand resisted the Cambodians' plea for 
arms," 
he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Kawit Chongkitthawon entitled: "Still Suspicion </F>
Over Thai Role in Cambodia"] 
  [Text] Thailand is shooting itself in the foot again over 
Cambodia's appeal for arms assistance from the West to combat 
the Khmer Rouge. 
  Comments made by Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and 
National Security Council Chief Gen Charan Kunlawanit were 
preposterous, not to mention the less than candor remarks by 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai. Chuan, who can make a difference 
in Thai-Cambodian relations, instead has chosen to sit on the 
fence with increasing antipathy. 
  In essence, the Thai leaders were saying all the same thing 
-- providing arms now for the Phnom Penh government would 
jeopardize the peace process in Cambodia. Thailand, they 
argued, would be affected by the ongoing fighting along the 
Thai-Cambodian border and the situation would worsen if more 
weapons are given to Phnom Penh. And these arms could be put up 
for sale along the Thai border. Finally, what Cambodia needs, 
they said, is humanitarian aid for its people. 
  What the Thais have not said are more interesting as in it 
are found expressions in the country's overall policy towards 
Cambodia. It is all boiled down to one thing -- Thailand has not 
yet done enough to dispel suspicious among the Cambodian and 
international community over the country's alleged existing 
links with the Khmer Rouge. 
  Therefore, the question of foreign aid in the form of arms 
to 
Cambodia has been brought into the picture to pressure Thailand 
to do more. 
  France, Australia and the United States, the three major 
countries which used to strongly support Thailand's policy 
toward Cambodia, have now all turned against Thailand. They are 
also fed- up with Thailand's halfhearted attitude towards the 
Phnom Penh government, which is the only legitimate group 
recognized worldwide. 
  Worse still, ASEAN is also turning its face away from 
Thailand. During the ASEAN senior officials' meeting in 
Phatthaya last month, Bangkok failed to garner support from the 
regional grouping in issuing a statement on the situation in 
Cambodia which stated that the crux of the current problem there 
was the infightings between the government and Khmer Rouge 
forces. Even Thailand's friends in ASEAN did not buy that kind 
of argument. 
  If the Cambodian controversy drags on into the future, 
Thailand's role in the ASEAN Regional Forum will be marred. 
Bangkok can never speak for the region's security and emerging 
strategic order as it would be considered a pariah if the Khmer 
Rouge issue persists. 
  Cambodia alone cannot change Thai behavior and for that 
reason more powerful countries have joined Phnom Penh's efforts. 
Clearly, the Western countries want to pressure Thailand to 
help with the peace process, Cambodia's rehabilitation and 
reconstruction, which have been beset with huge problems 
resulting from over two-decades of incessant civil war. 
  Without Thailand's cooperation, they realize, Cambodia's 
future stability will forever be in jeopardy. And the Thais 
know it fully well and are aware of their power and potential in 
Cambodia. As a bigger and richer country, Thailand has to be 
generous towards its neighbor. Bangkok cannot just adopt a 
tit-for-tat policy. But all blame must not fall on Thailand. 
Cambodia too has to share some of it. 
  From a historical perspective, Thai-Cambodian quarrels and 
conflicts, have more often than not stemmed from leadership 
idiosyncrasies among leaders in both countries. 
  On the Cambodian side, there is the mercurial King Norodom 
Sihanouk, who has spent literally all his life wading off 
Thailand, to ensure his country's neutrality and independence. 
He has outlasted and outmaneuvered many Thai leaders. In fact, 
King Sihanouk is the only world leader who knows Thailand 
(besides singing Thai songs) so well, including ways to draw 
Thai blood. And now, he is passing this art of survival through 
his clan, who are running the country. 
  As far as Thailand is concerned, Thai leaders just hate 
Cambodia. Behind the Thai smile lies a long sharp dragger. In 
the early Bangkok period, if the same conditions had prevailed 
as today, Thai troops would have stormed Cambodia several times 
over -- not to mention those lunatic Thai leaders in the 50's 
and 60's and what they might have done. 
  However, the present Thai leaders are not much better than 
their predecessors. They have shown ignorance and arrogance, 
the deep- rooted trait that does not support Thailand's growing 
clout in the regional economic and political arenas. They 
continue to view Cambodia through the same old prism, which had 
already caused numerous misunderstandings and tensions between 
the two countries for the past centuries. 
  How Thailand is dealing with -- Cambodia today is not 
dissimilar with the policy practiced in the 1950's-60's. Phnom 
Penh's outrageous reactions were equally predictable. 
Obviously, both sides have not learnt from their common history. 
  Unfortunately, even though there is a Cambodian 
ambassador-designate, Roland Eng, in Bangkok, he has yet to 
reconfirm and officially take up his job. Relations could 
improve if their diplomats on both sides met. Without proper 
consultation through diplomatic channels, the two countries 
could repeat the bitter past when they suspended bilateral 
relations twice under Sihanouk's reign. 
  Finally, the Khmer Rouge issue happens to be Thailand's 
current albatross in the long annals of Thai-Cambodian 
relations. The Thai leaders know that even without the Khmer 
Rouge problem, other hidden issues will quickly rear their ugly 
heads. In the end, there would always be the trouble-ridden 
Thai-Cambodian border with poor demarcations to quarrel about. 
  Absurd as it may sound, some of the Thai leaders still 
prefer 
to associate with the predictable and disciplined Khmer Rouge 
and are willing to sink with them, thinking that sooner or later 
they can get away with it as the world will have only Cambodia 
to be concerned about. 
  This is sheer folly that will bode ill for Thai-Cambodia 
ties.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday 
reaffirmed Thailand's policy of non-intervention in Cambodia's 
internal affairs, saying Thailand had no right to tell anyone 
what to do. 
  "Thailand never interferes in the internal affairs of 
another 
country," he said. 
  "The Cambodian request for arms assistance is a matter 
concerning only the donors and the recipients. Thailand cannot 
interfere or get involved." 
  Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh said on Monday 
that Bangkok's opposition to overseas military aid for his 
government was hypocritical and amounted to unacceptable 
interference. 
  Cambodian leaders have repeatedly accused Thailand of aiding 
the Khmer Rouge [KR] Through trade and by providing a safe haven 
on its soil. Thai authorities however, have denied helping the 
guerrillas. 
  "When they (government troops) lose (on the battlefield), 
they always find a scapegoat or someone to blame," the Foreign 
Minister said in response to the Cambodian government 
allegations against Thailand. 
  Foreign Ministry Director-General of East Asian Affairs 
Department, Don Pramutwinai, pointed out that Thailand did not 
object to the foreign supply of arms to the Phnom Penh 
government, as it had only expressed its opinion and goodwill to 
see lasting peace in Cambodia. 
  "We just expressed our feelings as a neighboring country 
which has always been affected by the fighting in Cambodia. The 
provision of arms by outsiders would prolong the conflict and 
would absolutely not bring peace to that country," Mr Don said. 
  Prince Ranariddh said Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivut had 
met the ambassadors of the United States, France, Britain and 
other countries to officially ask for military assistance to 
fight the Khmer Rouge. 
  Defense Minister Wichit Sukmak commented that arms 
assistance 
was "the least appropriate thing" for the Paris Peace agreement 
signatories to conduct. 
  His deputy minister Sombat Rotphothong said whoever wanted 
to 
assist Cambodia should consider whether that assistance would 
bring about peace in the country. 
  Maj-Gen Sombat noted that the solution to Cambodian problems 
would only be reached through political means, not military 
support, "otherwise the Cambodian people would be the ones who 
suffer most." 
  Gen Wichit reiterated Thailand's firm stand to see national 
reconciliation in Cambodia and the hope that the conflict would 
be settled through peaceful means. 
  "If the fighting continues, the repercussions on Thailand 
could not be avoided for we share a common border. We have no 
involvement but are burdened with such negative results," he 
said. 
  Asked if foreign military assistance would violate the 1991 
peace agreement, Gen Wichit said such was the case because the 
accord aimed at reducing and controlling arms in Cambodia. 
  "If there is still military support to one particular 
faction, the fighting will be prolonged and never end," Gen 
Wichit said. 
  Meanwhile, Cambodian ambassador-designate to Bangkok Roland 
Eng was yesterday invited by the Foreign Ministry to discuss the 
invitation extended to Cambodia to attend the ASEAN Regional 
Forum (ARF) scheduled for Bangkok in July. 
  Director-General Don quoted Mr Eng as expressing interest in 
participating in the meeting. However, Cambodia this year could 
not immediately join as they first need to have access to the 
Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of the Southeast Asian nations 
and hold observer status. 
  Mr Eng was also quoted as saying that he would take up his 
position in Bangkok soon. 
  He told reporters after a 30-minute discussion with Mr Don 
that he believed Thailand would want to see roundtable peace 
talks held as soon as possible and the Cambodian government was 
trying its best to organize such a meeting.

  [Text] The foreign minister says that, so long as there 
are weapons and fighting in Cambodia, it will be impossible to 
achieve peace there. Commenting about King Sihanouk's request 
for arms assistance from western countries and Australia to 
fight the Khmer Rouge, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri says Thailand will have nothing to do with that; it 
involves only the countries giving and receiving. However, he 
said, there will be no solution to the fighting if one resorts 
to the military option. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Has there been 
any request for sympathy from Australia? 
  [Prasong] Well, it is impossible for us to say: You should 
not give them the weapons. That would be an interference on our 
part. But we can tell them that we will have nothing to do with 
that; it's your business whether or not you are going to give 
them the weapons. Anyway, we believe that a settlement of the 
Cambodian problem should be achieved through political not 
military means. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said Thailand 
needs to be more cautious about looking after the Thai border if 
some countries decide to arm Cambodian government forces against 
the Khmer Rouge. 
  Speaking after his return from an official visit to the 
United Kingdom yesterday, Foreign Minister Prasong called for 
the solving of the Cambodian problem through negitiations 
instead of military means. 
  He said the military aid to Cambodia might escalate fighting 
along the Thai-Cambodian border thus affecting Thai villagers 
living in the area. The foreign minister said as long as 
fighting continues, genuine and lasting peace cannot be achieved 
in Cambodia. 
  He said the Cambodian issue was also raised for discussion 
with British leaders so that they clearly understood Thailand's 
stand on the issue. 
  He said Thailand has been providing assistance to Cambodia 
to 
help in the reconstruction of the country. The assistance is in 
the forms of military uniforms, road improvement, construction 
of schools and hospitals, and technical aid. The assistance is 
not aimed at encouraging fighting inside that country. This is 
because Thailand wishes to see peace in Cambodia.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Meeting on Paris Agreement"] </F>
  [Text] The world has tried hard to return peace to 
Cambodia, end the genocide among the Cambodian people 
themselves, and persuade them to help each other to restore 
their country. It appears, however, that the world is failing, 
as evidenced by the continued fighting between the Cambodian 
Government and the Khmer Rouge. Moreover, the trend will be 
towards prolonged fighting if foreign arms are poured into the 
country. 
  Thailand's view, which opposes arms being supplied from a 
dozen countries for the Cambodian Government to fight the Khmer 
Rouge, may carry little weight in light of repeated remarks by 
Cambodian Government officials accusing Thailand of aiding the 
Khmer Rouge. Though Thailand has not supported the Khmer Rouge 
as accused, if those countries believe those accusations they 
could provide funds and arms to the Cambodian Government as 
requested. 
  We wish to tell the world, especially the countries involved 
in the Paris agreement, that arms or financial support for any 
Cambodian side will make peace in Cambodia, which really is not 
that far away, completely impossible to achieve. The civil war 
will continue with more Cambodians becoming victims. 
  We sympathize with King Sihanouk being discouraged by 
disunity among the Cambodian people, which is causing peace to 
be unattainable. Couple this unity problem with foreign arms 
support -- so the Cambodians can kill each other, so that one 
faction will gain outright victory -- will fuel incessant 
fighting in Cambodia and endanger the region and the world. 
  We feel that if the superpowers really want peace to return 
to Cambodia, they should avoid arms support for any Cambodian 
faction. They should convene another meeting of the countries 
involved in the Paris agreement to find a solution to the civil 
war and forge national reconciliation for the Cambodian people 
and eventually for their survival. 
  We wish to warn the Cambodian Government that to completely 
subjugate the rival faction by war requires an overwhelming 
superiority. In the interest of the future of the Cambodian 
nation, national reconciliation must not be forged by continued 
violence.

  [Text] Before attending today's Cabinet meeting, Defense 
Minister General Wichit Sukmak talked to newsmen about the 
Cambodian first prime minister's accusation that the Thai army 
is supporting the Khmer Rouge. He said he had no knowledge 
about the charge, and that it may only be a remark made to a 
news agency. 
  Regarding Cambodia seeking arms aid from other countries to 
improve the capability of its armed forces, Thailand must 
consider this issue very carefully. 
  The defense minister said the worst thing United Nations 
member countries could do is to provide any Cambodian side with 
support that could worsen the conflict and fighting among the 
factions. Also, providing arms to the Cambodian Government is 
against the Paris peace accord that was signed, and which was 
jointly sponsored by France, the United States, and Indonesia. 
The agreement aimed to reduce the use of arms that had 
prolonged the fighting and delayed the establishment of peace. 
  The Thai Government wants to see national reconciliation 
work 
in Cambodia. Therefore, the Cambodian people should settle 
their conflict peacefully. The fighting in Cambodia has 
adversely affected the Thai people living in the areas bordering 
Cambodia for more than 13 or 14 years. Their property have been 
robbed and they have to live with the insecurity, concluded the 
Thai defense minister.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sihanouk Deserts Cambodia"] </F>
  [Text] King Norodom Sihanouk declared in Phnom Penh last 
Thursday that he felt hopeless about peace in his country and 
asserted that national reconciliation is dead. He said he was 
leaving for Beijing. 
  In his news conference, Sihanouk said the Khmer Rouge 
rejection of his peace initiatives led him to feel hopeless and 
to cancel the roundtable meeting on national reconciliation. 
  Late last month, King Sihanouk invited the Cambodian 
Government and Khmer Rouge leaders to a roundtable meeting at 
his palace to discuss national reconciliation. However, his 
invitation was rejected outright by Khieu Samphan, who claimed 
that there was no guarantee for his safety. 
  Sihanouk issued another invitation to the two Cambodian 
factions to attend a meeting in Pyongyang. He also let out his 
frustration by saying that he would ask for foreign troops to 
solve the problem in his country. 
  Last week, the Australian Foreign Ministry confirmed that it 
received a request for military assistance from Cambodian 
Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivut. The minister had made this 
request to the Australian, U.S., French, and ASEAN embassies in 
Phnom Penh. 
  Australia and certain countries are now considering arms or 
military training for Cambodia and consulting certain countries, 
particularly Thailand, on this issue. King Sihanouk, however, 
denies any knowledge of the matter. 
  A decision by any Western country or its allies to provide 
assistance to Cambodia, be it in the form of arms or military 
training, is tantamount to interference in the internal affairs 
of that country. 
  It can be said that by completely distancing himself from 
peace efforts in Cambodia, King Sihanouk has given the leaders 
of the two Cambodian factions the opportunity to seek foreign 
assistance to continue a war of genocide.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Cambodians Must Rebuild Their Disgraced Armed </F>
Forces"] 
  [Text] One of the defining images of U.S. involvement in 
the Vietnam war is a much celebrated picture of napalm-spattered 
girl, her mouth stretched wide in pain, fleeing down a 
paddy-lined road as plumes of smoke rise from her burning 
village in the background. 
  Another photo of the same era, while less known, serves a 
similar function of encapsulating Washington's role in Cambodia. 
It shows a young boy, not much older than the Vietnamese girl, 
swamped by his U.S.-supplied battle dress and M-16 getting ready 
to go to war. 
  Twenty years later, the photo still serves as a graphic 
reminder of the folly of providing massive military aid to the 
corruption-riddled regime of Lon Nol. In both Cambodia and 
Vietnam, foreign military assistance extended the suffering of 
the local populations. 
  Despite Phnom Penh's objections and cries of interference, 
Thai military leaders and politicians are right to criticize an 
appeal by Cambodia's leaders for international donations of arms. 
  The Royal Cambodian Army is poorly-equipped but it is not 
for 
lack of arms that it has suffered a string of stunning defeats 
at the hands of the better-armed Khmer Rouge over the last few 
months. The biggest problem, as Bangkok has noted, is corruption 
and poor leadership among its generals. 
  Sihanouk is well aware of the dangers of greed and 
incompetence among his officer corps, whom last week he called 
the "world's masters of corruption". After their defeats at the 
hands of the Khmer Rouge in Pailin and Anlung Veng, government 
soldiers complained their officers had been more interested in 
pillaging the area than taking proper precautions to defend the 
bases. 
  According to some reports, government officers requisitioned 
military trucks to transport their looted spoils back to Phnom 
Penh while wounded soldiers were left to walk out. 
  Irregularly paid, and poorly looked after, Cambodia's 
soldiers have little incentive to risk their lives. 
  Last week, Australia said it along with the United States 
and 
France were seriously considering the possibility of sending 
weapons to Cambodia. 
  Thailand has criticized the idea repeatedly, saying a 
renewed 
influx of arms would result in a prolonging of the conflict. 
Bangkok officials say they still hope to see a political 
settlement and national reconciliation but as Sihanouk, for long 
the leading proponent of cutting a deal with the Khmer Rouge, 
lamented last week, such a hope is looking increasingly vain. 
  At the height of its ugly diplomatic row with Phnom Penh 
over 
alleged assistance to the Khmer Rouge, Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri said Thailand was washing its hands of the Cambodia 
affair and he announced Thailand would play no part in hosting 
peace talks. 
  But the Cambodian problem won't go away. Shells continue to 
stray over the border and the unending upheaval across the 
border hurts Thai business interests and is a source of a wide 
range of criminal activity from banditry to gunrunning. 
  What would serve Thailand better would be to join an 
international effort to revamp the Cambodian armed forces. 
  An effectively trained and led army could do much to restore 
peace throughout much of Cambodia. A well-disciplined army 
would also eliminate one of the last sources of support for the 
Khmer Rouge -- the widespread resentment at official corruption 
and extortion by government soldiers. 
  Further more, aiding the government army may be the only way 
to dispel the widely-held impression that the Thai military 
continues to support the guerrilla group. 
  In the end, however, whatever military training the 
international community can offer, it will do little good unless 
the factionalized government in Phnom Penh also extends its 
support. The Cambodians must start the process of rebuilding 
their disgraced army and then perhaps the world will be in a 
position to help.

  [Text] Bangkok, May 16 (AFP) -- A local all-news FM radio 
station was off the air Monday in unexplained circumstances. 
  Reliable sources said transmissions were halted following 
harsh criticism of the military during a talk show on THE NATION 
radio at the weekend. Reached by telephone, the armed forces 
spokesman, Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, 
categorically denied the military had ordered the station to 
shut down. 
  Calls to the radio station went unanswered Monday, and staff 
members at The Nation daily, which provides programming to the 
station, said they did not want to discuss the issue. One 
employee described the situation as "sensitive." Another 
station said management of THE NATION radio had indicated the 
station was shut for three days for "maintenance." 
  Reliable sources said management of the radio station would 
meet Monday evening with officials of the Army's Territorial 
Defense department, which has the rights to the frequency on 
which the station broadcasts.

  [Text] THE NATION's FM-96 radio news station will resume 
broadcasting this morning after being suspended for three days 
by the army over a program considered to be critical of the 
armed forces. The Territorial Defense Department, which owns 
the station, blacked out the 24-hour broadcast on Sunday. 
  Supreme Command Spokesman Anuson Kritsanaserani said 
yesterday comments by well-known social critic Sulak Siwarak, 
who was a guest on THE NATION News Talk program last Saturday, 
were "biased" against the military. 
  "The army chief has laid down a policy that no army-owned 
radio stations must be allowed to air programs critical of the 
military," he said. FM-96 is leased to NPG Broadcasting Network 
an affiliate of THE NATION Publishing Group. 
  Suphap Klikachai, managing director of NPG Broadcasting, 
said 
the department had agreed to broadcasts resuming this morning.

  [Text] Bangkok, May 16 KYODO -- A Thai political activist 
vowed Monday [16 May] to go on a hunger strike to pressure the 
government to make further steps toward enacting true democracy 
in Thailand. 
  Chalat Worachat [spelling of name as received], 51, told 
KYODO NEWS SERVICE he was determined to start a hunger strike on 
May 25 and would not stop until the government starts the 
process of writing a new constitution stipulating direct 
elections for provincial governors and members of municipal 
councils, or resign or dissolve the House of Representatives. 
  Chalat went on a hunger strike two years ago which triggered 
a mass protest that led to a bloody political crackdown in May 
1992. The then military-dominated government was toppled after 
dozens of people were killed or went missing during the Army's 
suppression. 
  "I'll go on the fast to continue the cause of my struggle 
two 
years ago," Chalat said. He fasted for 47 days in 1992 and 
stopped on may 24 after the resignation of the then Premier Gen. 
Suchinda Kraphrayun. 
  Chalat, serving his second term as an elected member of 
Parliament, has gone on four hunger strikes during the past 10 
years and has been on a lone demonstration in front of 
Parliament since April 8. 
  Chalat made public his decision to go on a hunger strike 
last 
week, prompting a number of politicians and political activists 
to try to dissuade him. 
  A group of leading politicians and academics, led by 
Chamlong 
Simuang and two rectors of leading universities, met Monday and 
issued a resolution calling on Chalat to postpone his hunger 
strike. They said the four-point demands he is making need more 
time and that his hunger strike might trigger another political 
upheaval in the country. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai warned Sunday against 
unrealistic demands when he laid a wreath in remembrance of 
victims of the may 1992 uprising. He called on Thais to respect 
the principles of democracy and avoid repetition of the 1992 
unrest. 
  The present five-party coalition government, derived from an 
election after the upheaval, has been widely criticized by 
pro-democracy forces of inadequacy in moving the country forward 
on a democratic path. The government's attempt to amend the 
constitution was defeated in Parliament in March.

<F P=106> [Report by Mun Il-hyon from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China warned on 17 May that "North Korea would 
likely take extreme action [kuktanjok haengdong] if Western 
countries intend to isolate North Korea." 
  A Japanese Social Party delegate said that in a meeting with 
a delegation led by Kubo Wataru, secretary general of Japanese 
Social Party, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said on 
17 May that "it is possible for North Korea to take a very 
extreme method [kuktanjok pangbop]," and that "the Western 
countries should fully consider such a situation." 
  Regarding the replacement of fuel rods at a five-megawatt 
reactor, which has aroused strong protest from Western 
countries, including the United States, Vice Foreign Minister 
Tang said: "North Korea seems to show a hard-line attitude, but, 
actually, there is room for the settlement of the nuclear 
issue." Accordingly, he has strongly hinted that North Korea has 
not yet carried out the work of replacing fuel rods at its 
nuclear reactor. 
  The Japanese Social Party official said that Vice Foreign 
Minister Tang said China is now actively making efforts for the 
success of North Korean-U.S. talks. 
  This is the first time China has openly expressed that it 
has 
played a behind the scenes role in resolving the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  Also, the Japanese Social Party official said Vice Foreign 
Minister Tang expressed that while President Kim Il-song was in 
China he said to Chinese leaders on many occasions that North 
Korea has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, nor does 
it have the funds or technology necessary, or the need to 
produce them. 
  Regarding this, a Chinese high-level source said that 
"considering the special relationship between China and North 
Korea, breaking the promise made between the leaders of the two 
countries would not be easy," and that "the Chinese leadership 
believes that President Kim Il-song will keep his promise." He 
has also clearly expressed that China adheres to a negative 
position on North Korea's nuclear development.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Kang Yong-chin from Bangkok on the </F>
news conference by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu held in the VIP 
room at Bangkok's Don Muang airport on 17 May] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Is there any change in the situation of 
the North Korean nuclear problem? 
  [Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu] Although there were some 
hardline remarks, including those of U.S. congressional leaders 
and Defense Secretary Perry, there is no noticeable change in 
the situation. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection 
team, which entered North Korea on 17 May, will pay the greatest 
attention to examining the degree of progress in the replacing 
of fuel rods in the five-megawatt atomic reactor, which North 
Korea announced has already begun. In the event that the 
inspection team decides that the replacement of fuel rods has 
progressed, exceeding the dangerous level designated by the 
IAEA, it will suspend inspections and leave North Korea. It is 
the right of IAEA to decide this, and both the ROK and the 
United States will respect its decision. It is not an 
appropriate act for North Korea to have independently conducted 
the replacement of fuel rods without IAEA presence. However, if 
North Korea selected fuel rod samples of its own accord and is 
keeping them, and if there is a way for measuring them 
afterwards, a third round of U.S.-North Korea talks may be held. 
  The additional inspection of the radiochemical experimental 
power station in Yongbyon demanded by the UN Security Council 
should also be conducted. It seems difficult that the third 
round of U.S.-North Korea talks will be held late this month. 
The talks could be possibly held early next month. 
  [Reporter] There are reports that the United States will 
push for hardline measures against North Korea, including 
sanctions through the UN Security Council, prompted by remarks 
by U.S. congressional leaders. What is your opinion? 
  [Han] I understand that they did not mean immediate 
sanctions. Their intention is that sanctions should be imposed 
when the IAEA inspection team's report indicates the crossing of 
the dangerous level. Secretary Perry's remarks that North Korea 
came to possess used nuclear fuel that would enable it to 
produce four to five nuclear weapons means that this would be 
true when the replacement of fuel rods, which is ongoing 
presently, is totally completed. 
  [Reporter] Yun Ho-chin, councilor in the North Korean 
mission in Vienna, said that the replacement of fuel rods 
already began a month ago, and that North Korea is now taking 
out fuel rods. 
  [Han] The beginning of the replacement means that the 
replacement started from the moment of the suspension of 
operation. Therefore, whether fuel rods were actually taken out, 
and how many rods were taken out will be decided only after the 
IAEA inspection team submits the report. 
  [Reporter] More than half of all questions raised during 
the regular briefing by the U.S. State Department in the morning 
of 16 May were related to the North Korean nuclear problem. 
Therefore, it seems that this issue is now in an extremely 
important point. What is your opinion? 
  [Han] That is quite natural. The United States repeatedly 
warned in the past that if it decides that North Korea has 
advanced the replacement of fuel rods to a considerable extent, 
it will suspend efforts for solution through dialogue. Thus, 
the situation in which North Korea-U.S. dialogue was suspended, 
means the beginning of discussions of sanctions through the UN 
Security Council. 
  [Reporter] In the event that the UN Security Council begins 
discussion for sanctions, what is the future prospect of the 
situation? 
  [Han] The replacement of fuel rods is quite different from 
what was an issue in the past. The additional inspection should 
be conducted because North Korea "failed to do what it should 
do," and the replacement of fuel rods presents a serious problem 
because North Korea "is doing what it should not do." In the 
event that North Korea goes beyond the line, which it should not 
cross, the atmosphere in the United Nations will change. As a 
result, I believe, China will not show a negative attitude 
toward sanctions against North Korea. 
  [Reporter] What is the standard to decide the level which 
North Korea should not go beyond in replacing fuel rods? 
  [Han] The minimum work in the activities that the IAEA 
should perform is to carry to accomplishment the three 
principles of selecting, storing, and measuring the samples of 
fuel rods. This work is intended to find out past nuclear 
activities. However, the situation, in which one cannot decide 
what work North Korea carried out with the nuclear rods it took 
out, is indeed even more serious. 
  [Reporter] Is there any possibility of holding a 
working-level contact between North Korea and the United States 
in order to convey concerns of the international community to 
North Korea even before IAEA forwards the report on the result 
of its inspections? 
  [Han] If the inspection team leaves North Korea, for 
instance, tomorrow, a working-level contact will not likely be 
held. It is not likely that a contact will be held before the 
inspection team forwards the report on its inspection results.

    [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 17 May 
carry editorials commenting on the remarks of former opposition 
leader Kim Tae-chung, who is now chairman of the Asia-Pacific 
Peace Foundation, APPF, that North Korea's possession of two or 
three atomic bombs would not be much of a problem compared with 
the 20,000 nuclear warheads the United States has. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Mr. Kim Tae-chung's View on the North Korean 
Nuclear Issue." Referring to his remarks, the editorial says 
"it is not important how many nuclear bombs North Korea 
possesses but whether it actually has nuclear weapons." The 
editorial then says that it is "hard to understand" the APPF's 
excuse that Kim made the remarks in order to stress the futility 
of North Korea's possession of a few nuclear weapons because the 
number of nuclear warheads is not the focus of the nuclear issue. 
  Noting the ongoing international efforts to deter North 
Korea's nuclear development, the editorial holds that his 
remarks are "tantamount to throwing a wet blanket over such 
efforts," and calls on Kim to "clarify his view on the North 
Korean nuclear issue before or after he returns home from the 
United States." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "We Should Not Allow North Korea To Have a 
Nuclear Bomb, Not Even One Nuclear Bomb." Noting that his 
remarks regarding North Korea's nuclear issue has "caused 
ripples at home and abroad," the editorial maintains "regardless 
of the true intent behind his remarks, there is a high 
possibility that the remarks will confuse the government's North 
Korean policy." 
  Stressing the importance of deterring North Korea's nuclear 
development for the nation's interests, the editorial says, "In 
view of this, it is hard to read the true intent of Kim's remark 
that `the ROK and U.S. Governments have complicated the matter 
by not yielding a single point to North Korea.'" The editorial 
concludes that "While we are well aware of where Chairman Kim's 
true heart and aspiration for the improvement of the North-South 
relations lie, as one of the most respected personalities in ROK 
politics, he should refrain from making ambiguous remarks and 
should work towards a unified national view." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Does He Mean That the North's Nuclear Bomb 
Is Tolerable?" Referring to Kim Tae-chung's "shocking" remarks 
on the North's nuclear development the editorial says: "It is 
deplorable that he made such irresponsible remarks at a time 
when the entire nation is working hard to stop North Korea's 
nuclear development." 
  The editorial says Kim's remarks at the Washington's 
National 
Press Club proposing the invitation of Kim Il-song to the United 
States and the appointment of Former President Jimmy Carter as a 
special envoy to Pyongyang should have been "more discreet" 
  The editorial concludes that "he should restrain himself 
from 
making remarks creating uneasiness and confusion among the 
people who call for the transparency of North's nuclear issue 
and want to improve the relations between the North and South."

  [Text] Moscow, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Among the North Korean 
loggers having escaped from their logging camps in Siberia, 
those wishing to come to South Korea are known to number about 
90. 
  A source at the South Korean Embassy here said on Tuesday 
the 
number was obtained in a careful study of the records of those 
loggers who have thus far expressed wishes to resettle in South 
Korea. 
  The source said, however, there is no way to know how many 
loggers had escaped Siberian logging camps to date as both 
Russia and North Korea do not disclose their number. 
  Meanwhile, another source said North Korea had asked Russia 
to arrest and hand over about 40 of escaped loggers under the 
Russia- North Korea legal assistance agreement. 
  Besides, North Korean secret agents in Russia and other CIS 
(Commonwealth of Independent States) countries have stepped up 
activities to search and apprehend escaped loggers since Seoul 
announced a plan to allow them to resettle in South Korea, the 
source said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 18 (YONHAP) -- Five North Koreans who had 
escaped from North Korean logging camps in Siberia arrived at 
Kimpo International Airport on Wednesday afternoon via a third 
country. It is the first time for the Seoul government to allow 
North Korean loggers to resettle here through lawful means. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said, "the five North 
Korean loggers who had escaped to member countries of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) arrived in Seoul today 
after going through a lawful procedure. 
  "As they wanted to seek refuge in South Korea, the 
government 
decided to allow their resettlement here from a humanitarian 
point of view." The five were identified only by their names -- 
Choe Chong-nam, Kim Tong-un, Kim Sung-chol, Paek Ho-chol and Won 
Yu-chin. 
  Chang said he would not disclose no other detailed 
information about how the loggers could flee and reach Seoul, 
"in consideration of the position of concerned CIS countries and 
the personal safety of related people. Their arrival here 
reflects the government's strong will to put in practice a new 
diplomacy based on respects for freedom and human rights as a 
civilian government," he said. "The government will continue to 
maintain the position." 
  The loggers will get vocational training at a vocational 
education organization for a period so that they can adapt 
themselves to South Korean society, in addition to receiving 
some amount of money for resettlement here according to the law 
to protect North Koreans who defect to the South, a government 
official said.

  [Text] On 14 December 1959, a ship carrying 975 Koreans 
residing in Japan took off from Japan's Niigata port. It was the 
SS (Tovlsk) of the former Soviet Union, the first ship to 
repatriate Koreans residing in Japan to North Korea. North 
Korea rented the ship from the former Soviet Union. Since then, 
the SS (Tovlsk) carried Koreans from Japan to North Korea on 157 
occasions. On 20 August 1971, the Mangyongbong started its 
first voyage. The Mangyongbong was a 3,573-tonne passenger boat 
and served until the Mangyongbong-92 set sail in February 1992. 
  These ships were named after Mangyongbong, which is located 
at Mangyongdae, Kim Il-song's birthplace. This was reportedly 
intended to make Korean residents in Japan remember Kim Il-song 
and his birthplace. 
  The Mangyongbong-92 is 123.13 meters long and 20.40 meters 
wide. Its average speed is 20 knots (37 km) and its maximum is 
23 knots. It takes 27 hours to sail between the ports of Wonsan 
and Niigata, which are 1,000 kilometers apart. Even though it 
is a 9,339-tonne ship, it cannot sail in strong winds and high 
waves. 
  The ship has first class, second class, and third class. It 
can accommodate up to 220 passengers and a crew of 60 to 90 
people. 
  Every year, the Mangyongbong-92 carries 10,000 family 
members 
of Koreans who have already been repatriated to North Korea; 
goods to be sent to North Korean relatives of Korean residents 
in Japan; and businesses cargo controlled by the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan. It can carry up to 
1,000 tonnes of cargo, including 10 large buses and 30 passenger 
cars. 
  It was learned that each Korean resident in Japan must pay 
Y200,000, which covers the fare, accommodations, and 
transportation during their stay in North Korea.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chang Myong-su, secretary general of the </F>
Council for Studying Ways To Cope With the Return of Repatriates 
from the Republic (North Korea), by U Chong-chang; in Niigata, 
Japan, date not given--first two paragraphs are CHUGAN CHOSON 
introduction] 
  [Text] Mr. Chang Myong-su, 60, secretary general of "the 
Council for Studying Ways To Cope With the Return of Repatriates 
From the Republic," has been unable to set foot on his native 
land (North Kyongsang Province) for 50 years. This is because 
he once served as a Chongnyon [General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan] cadre. His parents and siblings have 
embarked on the repatriation ship, and he himself has also 
visited North Korea. Mr. Chang had been vice chairman of the 
Chongnyon headquarters in the Niigata region, famous for the 
base of repatriation ships. He left Chongnyon in 1989, and is 
now in the forefront of the anti-Chongnyon movement. 
  This is because he is conscience-stricken for having sent 
innocent compatriots to North Korea, a land of hell. His father 
and eldest brother died there after going through hardships. 
His second eldest brother has been missing since Mr. Chang 
began the anti-Chongnyon movement. I met with Mr. Chang at his 
apartment. He is waging an unaided struggle in Niigata. 
  [U Chong-chang] I hear that Chongnyon members are wavering. 
  [Chang Myong-su] In 1991, an event happened in Niigata. 
Cadres from North Korea called in the families of repatriates 
to the ship Mangyongbong-ho, threateningly, telling them to 
shell out donations. Then, giving 20 million yen, a businessman 
whose elder brother is in North Korea shouted "this money is not 
yours, but our family's." It had been unimaginable in the past 
for people of Chongnyon to stand against cadres from North 
Korea. This is a sign of wavering. 
  [U] Has your safety not been in danger while you have been 
engaged in the anti-Chongnyon movement? 
  [Chang] In October 1989, when I was about to contribute an 
article on the human rights abuse of repatriates to a Japanese 
monthly magazine for the first time, a Chongnyon cadre was 
dissuading me from writing such an article, saying that he would 
make arrangements for me to meet with Chairman Han Tok-su. I 
said that I would be willing to meet him if Chongnyon admitted 
that sending compatriots to North Korea is a national crime. 
After that, I had never heard from them. Since I founded the 
council in April 1990, I have been threatened and shadowed. 
They have even been spreading a rumor that I am a cat's paw of 
the ROK Government. 
  [U] In what direction have you decided to move your 
activities? 
  [Chang] A considerable number of the repatriates are 
missing. 
I understand that the Chongnyon Central Committee is in agony 
over this issue. Because Chongnyon has played a leading role in 
sending compatriots to North Korea, that organization should 
also resolve the issue of the return of the repatriates. I am 
determined to endlessly urge that Chongnyon resolve this issue. 
  [U] What is the response in Japan? 
  [Chang] Japanese broadcasting stations, which had been 
silent 
over Chongnyon's sending Korean residents to North Korea, dealt 
with the issue of repatriates in a series of three installments 
two years ago. I understand that Chongnyon's influence over 
Japanese journalism is enormous. But, the Japanese journalists 
are now paying attention to this issue.

  [Text] A Western diplomatic source in Beijing revealed on 
17 May that recently North Korea requested that all members of 
the liaison delegation of the Chinese side of the Military 
Armistice Commission [MAC] withdraw and return to China. North 
Korea is at odds with China, which opposed such a request. 
  This source said that before proposing to the United States 
to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement, North 
Korea officially requested in April that all five Chinese 
members of the liaison delegation, including a colonel-level 
senior delegate of the Chinese People's Volunteers liaison 
office of the DPRK-China side of the MAC, be withdrawn because 
"the historical duty of the Armistice Agreement has ended." 
  The Chinese side replied: "China would be making a big 
historical mistake if the Chinese side withdrew from the MAC 
when it has not been abolished." The Chinese side points out 
that it is trying to persuade North Korea, but it is being 
stubborn; therefore, China is in an awkward position. 
  While the Chinese side is hesitating to withdraw 
unilaterally 
from the MAC, North Korea proposed to the United States to 
replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement late last 
month and thus withdrew its MAC members to Pyongyang.

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- The Korea Maritime and 
Port Administration (KMPA) has decided against opening a direct 
regular sea route between South and North Korea for the time 
being, a KMPA official said Saturday. 
  The official said, "we do not have to hurry in establishing 
a 
regular sea route directly connecting South and North Korea, and 
we don't have any reasons either. Unless the North Korean 
authorities guarantee the safety of South Korean ships and crew, 
we won't allow the establishment (of the route)." 
  Seoul and Pyongyang agreed earlier that inter-Korean sea 
routes are not between two different nations but within one 
country, he said. 
  "It is a cabotage route. So we will prohibit foreign 
shipping companies from operating on the route," he said. 
  Under the decision, domestic shippers which operate joint 
ventures with foreign companies plying between South and North 
Korea should change the ventures to domestic corporations, 
according to the KMPA officials. 
  Companies which are pushing for new sea routes to and from 
North Korea will have to concentrate on non-regular routes 
transporting common cargo, not on regular routes carrying 
containers, the officials said. 
  "A regular inter-Korean route should be established after 
South and North Korean authorities agree to adopt systematic 
safety measures. That is the government's policy. If North 
Korea officially guarantees the safety of South Korean ships and 
crew, the establishment of a direct and regular sea route to 
North Korea will become possible anytime," an official said. 
  But South Korean ships can still depart for North Korea on 
non- regular direct routes authorized by the National 
Unification Board and the KMPA, according to the official. 
  "The government will actively support cargo transport to 
revitalize inter-Korean economic exchanges," he added.

  [Text] If emphasis on the principle of resolving the Korean 
peninsula's nuclear issue through direct negotiations with the 
United States is excluded, then foreign-affairs-related portions 
of Kim Il-song's New Year's address contain no new content this 
year either. 
  Kim Il-song repeated the general policy direction of past 
years: On the premise that it would consistently realize its 
foreign policy of autonomy, peace, and amity, North Korea, based 
on the principle of independence, would actively work for 
solidarity with socialist and nonaligned countries and would 
also develop good, friendly relations with capitalist countries 
that respect its sovereignty. 
  The call for the establishment of a new international 
political and economic order -- based on the destruction of the 
outmoded international political and economic order and on 
equality, justice, and impartiality, and for the elucidation of 
efforts at mutual cooperation and development, based on the 
principle of collective self-reliance -- was in no way new. 
  However, that the principle and method of resolving the 
Korean peninsula's nuclear issue was especially highlighted is 
worthy of note. It provides us with a useful clue as to where 
the focus of North Korea's foreign policy will be placed. 
  First let us examine related content. Kim Il-song stressed 
that because the so-called North Korea nuclear problem is a 
product of the U.S.' stubborn pursuit of its anti-socialist, 
anti-republican schemes and because it was the U.S. that brought 
up suspicions of their nuclear development and that brought 
nuclear weapons to the Korean peninsula, threatening them, the 
Korean peninsula's nuclear issue must be resolved completely 
through "North Korean-U.S. talks." He made the somewhat hopeful 
observation and expectation that the nuclear issue could be 
equitably resolved if the joint declaration adopted by the U.S. 
and North Korea were implemented. 
  Of course, this statement by Kim Il-song on the essence of 
the Korean peninsula's nuclear issue, the method and principles 
of resolving it, is only a repetition of what North Korea has 
continually argued since the North Korea nuclear problem became 
an international issue in the late 1980s. However, the 
background of this statement was the result last year of two 
rounds of direct North Korea-U.S. talks and compromise proposals 
between the two parties for resolving the North Korea nuclear 
problem, which subsequently became deadlocked. The fact that 
this statement was made in circumstances where the beginning of 
a solution to the North Korea nuclear problem was seen once 
again is judged to contain tremendous significance which 
absolutely cannot be overlooked. 
<H5>  New Year's Address a Repetition of Past Position </H5>
  By significance, we mean it suggests that North Korea will 
continue to use the nuclear issue as a most important lever for 
landmark improvement of its relationship with the United States, 
and, furthermore, that the direction of its foreign policy will 
be focused on improvements related to its policy toward the 
United States. 
  To predict North Korea's foreign-policy direction for this 
year too, having its relationship with the United States as its 
main direction of attack, North Korea will concentrate on 
improving, restoring and developing its relations with its 
surrounding superpowers: Japan, China, and Russia. Furthermore, 
it appears that it will also continue its Asia-oriented 
diplomacy. It is predicted that North Korea will strengthen 
multilateral diplomacy at the same time, such as conducting 
active economic and commercial diplomacy. It is possible to 
infer these predictions from internal and external conditions, 
and from the realities facing North Korea, even though nothing 
was mentioned in the New Year's address. 
  North Korea has no choice but to make improving relations 
with the United States its foremost policy objective because 
whether it is able to improve relations with the United States 
is the most decisive variable controlling the success of its 
overall diplomatic plan. 
  As is commonly known, this is because improved relations 
with 
the United States cannot only restore considerably setbacks in 
its diplomatic competition with the South resulting from 
ROK-USSR and ROK-PRC rapprochement, but also stimulate the 
restoration and development of relations with China and Russia. 
Moreover, it is because it is a very important issue linked 
directly with the creation of an environment favorable for the 
satisfactory execution of commercial and economic diplomacy, 
such as attracting foreign capital and technology. Thus, North 
Korea has made plentiful use of its nuclear card, the only one 
it actually has and its most powerful negotiation lever. There 
is a high probability, it is judged, that North Korea has 
established the realization this year of normalized relations 
with the United States through this, as far as possible, as its 
highest-priority, foreign-policy objective. 
  It appears that North Korea's U.S. strategy and tactics 
related to this will have as their underlying tone a package 
settlement of normalization with the United States, but will 
also show the flexibility of providing for a staged approach, 
depending on conditions and circumstances. 
<H5>  Policy of Giving Priority to Normalization With the United </H5>
States 
  As background for this, given the fact that the United 
States 
has presented as conditions for a landmark improvement of its 
relations with North Korea, including normalization, the 
resolution of the nuclear issue, improvement of human-rights 
conditions within North Korea, the discontinuance of the 
overseas transfer of weapons and technology of mass destruction, 
and the renunciation of terrorism, we can mention the fact that 
the only choice North Korea has capable of causing the United 
States to relax other conditions, ultimately agreeing to 
normalization, is the continued use of its nuclear card. 
  This is also because, as a result of its stubborn insistence 
on a "package settlement," which appeared reckless, it was 
finally accepted, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of this 
approach. 
  In the second round of North Korea-U.S. talks, a decision 
was 
made -- on the assumption that North Korea-IAEA and North 
Korea-ROK talks and negotiations would be held and progress made 
-- on a staged solution: a third round of high-level talks would 
be opened and discussions held on the problems of a resolution 
to the nuclear issue and an improvement of U.S.-North Korea 
relations. Afterward, with the North Korea nuclear issue at an 
impasse due to its failure to meet preconditions, North Korea 
proposed a "package settlement" on 11 November 1993 through Vice 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Sok-ju. Ultimately, it was able 
to solicit a new solution, called a "thorough and broad 
solution," from the ROK-U.S. summit talks on 23 November. 
  Afterward, the United States and North Korea, through many 
rounds of unofficial contact in New York, arrived at a 
compromise plan, announcing the reopening of North Korea-IAEA 
negotiations, the entrance into North Korea of the IAEA 
inspection team, and at the same time the suspension of Team 
Spirit exercises, and the opening of a third round of North 
Korea-U.S. talks. This demonstrates that the "package 
settlement" was in fact essential. 
  Based on this analysis and understanding, North Korea 
strictly distinguished between "continuity of safeguards" of the 
nuclear safeguard agreement and the issue of "full compliance" 
with the agreement, sticking to its existing position that the 
latter must be resolved in direct talks with the United States. 
It is clear that it will pursue a strategy of ultimately 
achieving normalized relations with the United States by 
concluding a package settlement of this issue and the so-called 
U.S. abandonment of its nuclear threat and hostile policy toward 
the North. 
<H5>  Predicted To Adopt a Staged-Normalization Policy </H5>
  However, in regard to going as far as normalization with the 
United States, because there are many obstructing factors, such 
as the problem of satisfying other preconditions presented by 
the United States, it appears that North Korea will have no 
choice but to adopt a staged method of approaching normalization. 
  After first obtaining a declaration of the suspension of 
Team 
Spirit exercises from the United States by allowing the IAEA 
inspection team to enter the North to ensure the continuity of 
safeguards of the nuclear safeguards agreement, North Korea will 
carry on negotiations in a third round of talks to see that the 
United States accepts, to the greatest extent possible, its 
demands concerning a package settlement. 
  At this stage, there is a high probability that North Korea 
will try a staged strategy. After first reaching an agreement to 
remove the embargo on exports to the North and on a U.S.-North 
Korea exchange of mutual liaison missions, it will show 
flexibility in accepting inspections of the two locations in 
question, the final resolution of full compliance of the nuclear 
safeguards agreement, and by responding to a certain extent to 
the various U.S. preconditions, it will achieve its ultimate 
goal, normalization. 
  If its strategy of improving relations with the United 
States 
gains considerable success, North Korea will put its interest in 
normalizing relations with Japan. Since unilaterally breaking 
off talks due to the "Yi Un-hye problem" in the Eighth 
Normalization Talks in November 1992, North Korea has 
consistently maintained a hard-line posture concerning the 
Japanese side's request that the talks be resumed, saying that 
it will never sit down to normalization talks as long as Japan 
has not abandoned its hostile policy toward the North. It has 
actually intensified its criticism of Japan. However, it is 
difficult to draw the hasty conclusion that North Korea will 
continue to stick to its hard-line posture of rejecting 
normalization negotiations this year too. This is because the 
mood for resuming negotiations is taking a turn for the better 
and because North Korea's own needs demand that it make progress 
as rapidly as possible in normalization discussions with Japan. 
<H5>  Normalizaton With Japan: A Means for an Economic </H5>
Breakthrough 
  Although North Korea broke off talks using the "Yi Un-hye 
problem" as a pretext, this was nothing more than a superficial 
reason. It is no exaggeration to say that the main reason was 
actually North Korea's dissatisfaction concerning Japan's taking 
a hard-line stance, such as adding more stringent demands 
concerning the North Korea nuclear problem as prerequisites for 
progress in normalization discussions. However, the nuclear 
issue is starting to be resolved and Japan too is showing a 
change in its posture, not insisting on linking the nuclear 
issue with normalization. Thus, one of the greatest obstructions 
is being cleared up. 
  Something else worthy of note is the fact that the new 
Japanese Government shows a greater intention to improve 
relations with the North than the Liberal Democratic Party 
government. The Japanese Socialist Party, which has strongly 
demanded early normalization of relations with North Korea, is 
the majority faction within the coalition cabinet, and Prime 
Minister Hosokawa himself, in his first speech in August of last 
year, was the first prime minister to characterize World War II 
as "aggressive behavior," and clearly expressed regret for the 
past, such as apologizing and expressing deep regret concerning 
past colonial rule. This too is helping in the creation of an 
environment favorable for the resumption of normalization talks. 
  Not only this, but Foreign Minister Hata showed a positive 
stance toward the resumption of normalization talks, such as 
demanding that the Socialist Party mission, which visited North 
Korea on 28 December 1993, convey to the North Korean side that 
the Japanese Government is always willing to talk with North 
Korea, that the prime minister's expression of apology 
concerning World War II also had North Korea in mind, and that 
it is willing to give economic aid to North Korea if the nuclear 
issue is resolved. 
  Moreover, with the approach of the 50th anniversary of the 
end of World War II, the Japanese Government is displaying 
considerable willingness to settle issues of the past with 
surrounding nations, saying Japan can no long be tied down by 
past history. 
  Furthermore, for North Korea too an early conclusion of 
normalization discussions with Japan is needed to meet the 
development costs of the free economic trade zones and for 
success in its policy of actively attracting the capital and 
technology of advanced countries. In the context of settling 
issues of the past, the Japanese Government is showing 
intentions to pay postwar reparations. Thus, the interests of 
both parties are drawing close. 
<H5>  Restoration of Relationship With China Due to National </H5>
Interests of Both Parties 
  The above change of circumstances was sufficient to 
stimulate 
a change in North Korea's attitude toward normalization talks. 
However, there is also the possibility that North Korea will 
watch a little longer the progress of its relationship with the 
United States and political developments within Japan, and that 
it will for the time being make good use of a waiting strategy 
to earn time for extracting large-scale concessions from Japan, 
rather than hastily agreeing to a resumption of normalization 
talks. North Korea will ultimately agree to resume normalization 
talks, however. The time for this will be the latter half of 
this year, at the latest. 
  It is predicted that North Korea will be more mercenary in 
its relationship with China. The relationship had become 
somewhat estranged after ROK-PRC normalization, but has been 
recovering since the second quarter of last year. Working to 
restore its relationship with Russia, which is as cold as ever, 
it will also be active in furthering relations with surrounding 
Asian countries, concerning which it made considerable efforts 
last year. 
  Concerning the need for North Korea to be more mercenary in 
its relationship with China, there is no room for further 
debate. Not only is this because it shares with China the 
highest joint objective of defending the socialist system, but 
it is also because in the nuclear issue, the greatest issue of 
the day, and in dealing with the issues of normalization with 
the United States and Japan, China is really its only strong 
backer. Moreover, China is North Korea's greatest trading 
partner and an important supplier of energy and foods, such as 
petroleum and grain. 
  Therefore, North Korea urgently needs the cooperation of 
China to resolve the nuclear issue and the issue of 
normalization with the United States and Japan, and to overcome 
its economic crisis. China also judges North Korea's diplomatic 
isolation and economic crisis not to be in its national 
interests. Because, facing a Pacific era, it also has designs to 
use North Korea as a bridgehead for making inroads into the 
Asian-Pacific region, it views restoring its relations with 
North Korea as rapidly as possible as being in its national 
interests. 
<H5>  Concentration on Commerical-Economic Diplomacy Predicted </H5>
  With the interest of both sides meeting, it is possible 
their 
relationship will develop further. The visit to China on January 
15th this year of Party Secretary and Supreme People's Assembly 
Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Hwang Chang-yop can be seen 
as a sign of this. 
  Interpretations of the purpose of Hwang's visit to China are 
diverse, but even the one fact that he is the highest-level 
official to visit China since ROK-PRC normalization is 
sufficient to read North Korea's intention to improve relations 
with China. This could develop into summit diplomacy of 
prime-minister-or-above level, depending on the results of his 
visit. Should this succeed, it is predicted that the 
relationship between the two will be restored, to a considerable 
extent, to the state it was in before ROK-PRC normalization. 
  Unlike China, North Korea's emotional resentment concerning 
ROK-USSR normalization continues as before. It is a fact that, 
because the CIS is already taking an understanding different 
from the former Soviet Union in all areas, diplomatic, economic, 
and military, North Korea is not showing any aggressiveness in 
improving relations with it, and Russia in particular. However, 
in the event there is progress in its relations with the United 
States and Japan, it appears that North Korea will gradually 
begin working to restore its relationship with Russia. It has 
continually neglected its cold relationship with Russia because, 
from an economic and military perspective, it is of no help. 
  For Russia too, there is a great probability it will judge a 
restoration of its relations with North Korea, from a purely 
economic and military standpoint, to be beneficial to its 
national interests. In a Russian Foreign Ministry report on 
trilateral trade recently obtained by the Korean Trade Promotion 
Corporation, the Russian Government explores the possibility of 
trilateral economic cooperation connecting the ROK and North 
Korea, and estimates that it will be able to play the role of 
mediator in trilateral cooperation. This supports the above 
conclusion. 
  Besides this, North Korea will continue Asia-oriented 
diplomacy, centered on Southeast Asian nations. Although 
obscured last year by diplomacy with the United States, the 
focus of its diplomacy has been the strengthening of its 
cooperative relationships with Southeast Asian countries. It was 
successful in securing bridgeheads for advancing into Southeast 
Asia in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia. With this as a 
springboard, North Korea will try to increase the pace of 
development in its relations with these countries in every area, 
political, economic, and military. 
  Meanwhile, together with improving relations with the United 
States, commercial and economic diplomacy are predicted to form 
the central axis of North Korean diplomacy. It is a well-known 
fact that North Korea has long given much weight to commercial 
and economic diplomacy. 
  The prediction that it will increase the pace of this is 
based on the fact that North Korean measures to attract foreign 
capital have now become full-scale. First of all, the 
introduction of foreign capital into the free economic trade 
zones at Najin and Sonbong is forecast to begin this year. 
Particularly in the 21st Session of the Sixth Party Congress, a 
policy putting trade first was selected as a new, revolutionary 
economic strategy. Since the announcement of the Foreign 
Investment Law in October 1992, great changes being carried out 
in North Korea's economic-development line, such as the 
continued enactment of foreign-investment-related laws, and the 
urgent need for a stable supply of food and energy are factors 
making a strengthening of commercial and economic diplomacy 
unavoidable. 
  Thus, it is thought that North Korea will concentrate on the 
multilateralization of its trade, introduction of foreign 
capital and technology, and sources for food and energy supply.

  [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- The Supreme Public 
Prosecutor's Office took over an American soldier convicted of 
homicide from U.S. military authorities at 11 a.m. Tuesday and 
sent him to Chonan city prison. The soldier, Pvt. Kenneth 
Markle III, filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme 
Court last Friday asking not to be handed over to Korean 
authorities, but Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist turned it 
down. Markle, 21, of Keyser, West Virginia, was convicted last 
year of murdering a Korean woman, Yun Kum-i, 26, in her boarding 
room in October 1992, but had been confined in a U.S. military 
prison at Pyongtaek under the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) 
between South Korea and the United States.

  [Text] A medic of the 20th Infantry Regiment of the Second 
U.S. Division, Private Kenneth Markle served in Tongduchon, 
Kyonggi Province. If he had not gone AWOL from his unit on 27 
October 1992, he would have returned home honorably as a U.S. 
serviceman who had completed his duty in a dangerous area. On 
that day, however, he committed a heinous crime which will not 
easily be erased from the memory of Koreans. He killed a Korean 
prostitute working for U.S. servicemen in Tongduchon by hitting 
her on the head four times with a coke bottle. 
  As the mass media reported the atrocity of this incident, 
which was referred to as the so-called "murder of Ms. Yun 
Kum-i," the public was stirred and denounced the crimes of U.S. 
servicemen. Some pointed their arrow of blame to the 
authorities of the U.S. Armed Forces, while others held the 
government responsible. Those with extraordinary interest in 
this incident have even formed a joint committee to cope with it 
in an effort to appeal for the revelation of details into the 
truth of the incident. Lamenting Ms. Yun's death, the U.S. 
Armed Forces authorities in the ROK have made clear that "if the 
accused is convicted in an ROK court, we will help send him to 
an ROK prison." On 29 April, Private Markle was finally 
sentenced with the severe punishment of 15 years of 
imprisonment by an ROK court, and he will soon be transferred to 
an ROK prison. 
  Thus, the murder case of Ms. Yun Kum-i has been settled. 
But, crimes by U.S. servicemen have not come to a complete end. 
While the stir surrounding the murder case has died down, 
however, such crimes which had been subdued for some time, are 
showing signs of raising their head again. This is 
substantiated by the number of cases involving crime by U.S. 
servicemen as disclosed by the Report Center for Damages 
Incurred From U.S. Servicemen's Crimes, the organization 
affiliated with the Headquarters of the Movement for Rooting Out 
Crimes by U.S. Servicemen in the ROK (co-chairman: Pastor Chon 
U-sop). 
<H5>  Writer Choe In-ho Is Also a Victim </H5>
  The Report Center opened to provide legal aid activities for 
victims of crimes by U.S. servicemen. With headquarters in 
Seoul, the center opened on 1 April and keeps watch over U.S. 
servicemen's crimes through its ten chapters in areas where U.S. 
servicemen are stationed. 
  In April alone, over 20 cases of various crimes involving 
U.S. servicemen were reported at the center. In one case, a man 
suffered a broken nose while trying to mediate in a quarrel 
involving bullying by a group of U.S. servicemen, and in 
another, a man was hit by a hit-and-run car of a U.S. 
serviceman. The common feature of these cases is that only the 
victims have suffered. 
  Such a tendency has become more apparent recently. Mr. Cho 
Chae-hak, a representative secretary of the Report Center, said: 
"Before the first trial on Private Markle was referred to an 
ROK court for sentencing, a bloodthirsty atmosphere prevailed, 
and U.S. servicemen dared not commit a crime. The U.S. Armed 
Forces authorities appeared to be trying to keep their 
servicemen under discipline in a bid not to unnecessarily incur 
the Korean people's displeasure. The situation has begun to 
change gradually, however, and it seems that U.S. servicemen 
have returned to their past attitude of callousness and 
arrogance." 
  In fact, as long as the present status continues, we can say 
that while U.S. servicemen's crimes become slightly subdued 
under certain circumstances, we cannot say that they have been 
reduced to the level of "extinction." This is because when a 
crime involving a U.S. serviceman takes place, most 
aspects--such as procedure and conditions of involvement by the 
ROK and US sides, the investigation process, the treatment of 
the accused, and retroactive compensation --are stipulated to 
the advantage of the U.S. servicemen. This is all the more 
convincing in light of the case of writer Choe In-ho who was 
practically forced into an early end to his writing career due 
to a car accident on the Yongdong Express Way on 21 March. 
  That accident occurred because the U.S. serviceman who was 
driving the military truck on the expressway was dozing. Mr. 
Choe In-ho's car could not avoid the charging vehicle as it 
abruptly crossed the median strip. Mr. Choe suffered severe 
injuries and was hospitalized for four weeks. Fortunately, Mr. 
Choe recuperated and was discharged from the hospital some time 
ago, but he has yet to be compensated for his completely damaged 
car, not to speak of the medical costs incurred, because when 
someone is involved in a car accident for which a U.S. 
serviceman is responsible, that person must wait at least six 
months for reparations such as medical fees. 
  While Mr. Choe is unlikely to suffer much unfairness 
because, 
as a leading ROK novelist, he has both the social stature and 
ability to readily find the legal means to settle the case on 
his own, what would happen to someone who didn't have the same 
social status or ability? The answer is "there would be no 
choice but to suffer." 
<H5>  This Means That We Have Given Up Jurisdiction Ourselves </H5>
  This is confirmed if we take a look at the status of U.S. 
servicemen's crimes that occurred recently in the Tongduchon 
area where six U.S. military camps such as Camp Casey and Camp 
Mobile are located. A typical case was that of Mr. Pak 
Kyong-nim, a standbar manager in Tongduchon. 
  Mr. Pak met with an accident last Christmas. After closing 
his business that night, Mr. Pak and his co-workers went to a 
U.S. servicemen's club in Posan-dong. He was severely injured 
by a U.S. serviceman who stabbed the left side of his chin, his 
right arm, and the his abdomen. He received 40 stitches. At 
that time, Pak and his group were engaged in a gang fight 
against the U.S. servicemen. The self-regulating civilian 
vigilantes in Posan-dong caught two black servicemen who were 
alleged offenders on the spot and referred them to the U.S. 
military police detachment. But, that was the end of it. The 
ROK prosecutor handed over jurisdiction to the U.S. military on 
grounds that the case was minor, and the U.S. military side 
released the suspects on grounds of insufficient charges. Far 
from getting any compensation, at this point, Mr. Pak does not 
even know the names of the offenders. 
  According to data submitted to the National Assembly by the 
Ministry of Justice as part of the former's inspection of the 
government administration in 1992, only 12 of a total 338 cases 
of U.S. servicemen breaking the law on various occasions such as 
in violence, car accidents, or thefts as compiled between 
January and August 1992 received severe punishment such as going 
to jail or a dishonorable discharge from the military. In view 
of this, it is clear-cut what result will be meted out to the 
Koreans who have suffered from U.S. servicemen's crimes. Mr. 
Chang Tae-won, chief of the self-regulating civil vigilantes in 
Posan-dong, Tongduchon, said: "We refer offenders that we 
apprehend to the U.S. military police first, but, we have never 
been notified by the U.S. Armed Forces of the outcome of such 
cases." 
  Crimes involving U.S. servicemen are handled according to 
the 
provisions in the Status of Forces Agreement [SOFA] between the 
ROK and the United States, which was revised in 1991. According 
to this agreement, the ROK side has primary jurisdiction except 
for in cases of "crimes committed against United States property 
or security" or "crimes committed during the execution of one's 
official duties." Therefore, in Mr. Pak's case, the ROK 
Government even gave up its natural duty to its citizens. 
According to experts, such contradictions originate from the 
existing SOFA in which agreed upon provisions such as minutes 
and items of understanding impair the legal effectiveness of the 
main agreement. 
  For example, the agreed minutes, which are an addendum to 
the 
main agreement, stipulate that even if there is no request from 
the United States, the ROK shall not ask for the primary 
jurisdiction from the U.S. side "for swift handling of the 
cases." This means that the clause for 'automatic 
relinquishment of jurisdiction,' which was written out in 1991's 
revision, has been revived. Furthermore, the agreed minutes 
stipulate that "in the event that a representative from the 
United States is not present, the statement made by a suspect or 
the accused shall not be adopted as evidence for conviction." 
  Professor of International Law Yi Chang-hui (Hankuk 
University of Foreign Studies) has firmly said that the 1991 
revision of the SOFA is insubstantial. He said that, excepting 
severe crimes such as murder or rape, the ROK Government is 
still unable to exercise its jurisdiction and its rights to 
direct investigation over U.S. servicemen's crimes because of 
the various "exceptions," such as the minutes that were agreed 
upon. While the stir surrounding the murder of Ms. Yun Kum-i 
abates, crimes by U.S. servicemen are raising their head once 
more as if to jeer the insubstantial SOFA provisions. Professor 
Yi is going to hold a large-scale public hearing this July with 
a view to attracting public attention to the revision of the 
SOFA.

  [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- A secretary to President 
Kim Yong-sam for political affairs, Yun Won-chung, left for 
London and Washington Monday to study the electoral systems of 
the two advanced democracies in support of Kim's election reform 
program. 
  Yun, an official at the office of the senior presidential 
secretary for political affairs, will tour the two countries for 
two weeks collecting data and meeting with officials about their 
electoral systems, especially their election management systems, 
before returning home around May 29. 
  The amendments to Korea's election laws recently passed by 
the National Assembly have provided the legal grounds for clean 
and inexpensive polls, a Chongwadae [presidential offices] 
official said. The question now is how to implement the new laws 
to achieve clean and cheap elections, he added. "Secretary Yun 
will visit the United Kingdom and the United States to research 
their election management systems and collect data which may 
help implement the new laws," he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Son Ke-yong] </F>
  [Text] As Seoul and Washington have been at loggerheads 
over imported American sausages for several months, the Foreign 
Ministry is seeking to defuse looming trade frictions between 
the two countries. 
  "The ministry is positively considering improving current 
regulations," said a ministry official, hinting that the 
government would move to partially accept U.S. demands. 
  The trade dispute was ignited March 22 when the 
Health-Social 
Affairs Ministry decided to reclassify U.S.-produced sausages, 
virtually banning their import. 
  The ministry said that Korean importers had brought into the 
country heat-treated chilled sausages after making a false 
declaration to authorities that they were importing non-heat 
treated frozen sausages in order to lengthen their shelf life. 
  The regulatory shelf life of non-heat treated frozen sausage 
is 90 days while that of heat-treated chilled sausage is 30 days. 
  Meanwhile, the United States raised the sausage issue at a 
recent GATT session, threatening to "review all options 
available and appropriate," a remark which has been used just 
before threatening to impose Super 301 trade sanctions. 
  The U.S. side claimed that the Seoul government slapped the 
import ban without any prior notice and any scientific evidence 
to determine that the sausages are hazardous to the public 
health. 
  An American sausage producers association has already asked 
the U.S. Government to designate Korea as a priority foreign 
country (PFC) in accordance with the Super 301 trade act. 
  So far, the Health-Social Affairs Ministry is showing no 
signs of yielding to the U.S. demand, asserting that it took due 
measures within legal boundaries. 
  "In consideration of public health, the ministry has no 
alternative but to ban the circulation of the sausage," said a 
health ministry official said. 
  The ministry has already taken punitive actions against 
officials in charge of the sausage import for neglecting their 
duties, which gives the ministry little maneuvering room in 
dealing with the issue. 
  In support of the ministry's decision, domestic consumers 
groups are preparing to launch a large-scale campaign against 
the import of American sausages, calling the U.S. threat 
"unacceptable." 
  The Citizens' Alliance for Consumer Protection of Korea 
already issued a statement last month, saying that it would 
boycott U.S. products if Washington doesn't drop its trade 
pressure. 
  In contrast with the health ministry's stand, the Foreign 
Ministry is considering adopting new measures to minimize trade 
frictions. 
  Currently, 37 container loads of U.S. sausage, worth $1.3 
million, have been sitting at the southern port of Pusan since 
mid- February. 
  The Foreign Ministry seems to think that there is no way to 
save the sausage in Pusan because its shelf life has almost 
expired. 
  It takes about one month to ship sausage from the United 
States to Korea and almost two months have passed since the ban 
was imposed. 
  "Even though the $1.3 million worth of sausage is relatively 
small in view of trade volume between the two countries, it 
could have a serious impact on the bilateral trade 
relationship," an official said. 
  The ministry is expected to hold another consultation 
session 
with the Health-Social Affairs Ministry to upgrade the current 
food regulation laws. 
  The domestic market share of U.S. sausages amounts to 15 
percent and large department stores and supermarkets have sold 
them to Korean consumers at relatively low prices compared with 
locally produced sausages, the health ministry said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- An opinion poll has found 
that nearly three-quarters of the respondents think the National 
Assembly should approve the Uruguay Round trade agreements and 
prepare the nation for the upcoming era of global trade 
competition. 
  According to the poll conducted by Media Research Co. on May 
11, 74.4 percent of the 700 adults questioned thought parliament 
should ratify the trade accords while 19 percent felt the 
agreements should be rejected. The telephone poll also showed 
that 55.3 percent reacted favorably to the Uruguay Round 
agreements with 37.5 percent expressing outright opposition, 
according to the results released Monday. Thirty-seven percent 
believe that President Kim Yong-sam has been doing a good job 
while 48.1 percent rated Kim's performance fair and 13.3 percent 
poor. 
  On the issue of the leaders of liberal opposition groups 
joining the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), 40.7 percent 
reacted favorably and 40.3 percent negatively. 
  The ruling DLP earned a 33.5-percent approval rating while 
the main opposition Democratic Party received 21.2 percent, the 
New Political Reform Party 8.6 percent, the New Korea Party 1.3 
percent and the Unification National Party 1 percent. But 34.4 
percent of the pollees said they supported no political party.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter O Yong-chin] </F>
  [Text] Korea is expected to give an ultimatum to China to 
withdraw its unacceptable demand or risk no agreement at all in 
their future aviation talks aimed at inaugurating regular 
flights between the two countries. 
  A senior official of the Transportation Ministry strongly 
hinted yesterday that it might have to stop the negotiations 
with China and open aviation talks with Taiwan, instead. 
  "Negotiations between Korea and China have been going 
nowhere 
over the past two years due to China's unacceptable demands. It 
is now time for Korea to consider another option, which is 
Taiwan," the official said. 
  Korea switched diplomatic ties to China from Taiwan two 
years 
ago. Since then, regular flights between Korea and Taiwan have 
been cut off, while Korea and China have initiated charter 
flights between Seoul and China's two cities, Shanghai and 
Tienjin. 
  For Korean Air alone, the loss from the closing of the 
Taiwan- Korea route is estimated to reach about 100 million U.S. 
dollars a year, according to an airline official. Hundreds of 
thousands of Taiwanese visited Korea annually before the 
diplomatic breakup. 
  "We can't accommodate China's demands, which are on the 
borderline with outrage," the official said. "Either they back 
off or else." 
  The two countries will make last-ditch efforts to conclude 
an 
aviation agreement in the next meeting, expected to take place 
later this month or early next month. 
  So far, there have been seven such meetings with the last 
one 
in February. 
  A major bone of contention is China's demand to unilaterally 
use a beyond point right from Seoul, possibly to Los Angeles, 
while Korea reserves its due right to link their flight from 
Beijing to Europe. 
  If that's not possible, China argued for its unilateral 
right 
to shuttle from a major Chinese city to Seoul, excluding the 
participation of a Korean airline. 
  None of China's demands is acceptable to Korea since they 
violate the basic spirit of "fair and equal opportunities" 
evident in all air agreements, according to the official. 
  He observed that China's demands are based on "fair and 
equal 
benefits," a typical socialist code but unacceptable in terms of 
market-oriented competition. 
  "At the moment, Korean carriers fly about 70 percent of 
passengers using Korea-China chartered flights, while the rest 
go to Air China," he said. "If regular flights open, the gap 
will be soaring." 
  He interpreted China's stubborn pursuit of the biased 
agreement as being aimed at rectifying the current imbalance of 
revenues and nipping in the bud the future runaway gap. 
  However, he said that some of the imbalance can be corrected 
through the negotiations between the two countries' airlines. 
  "The imbalance of revenues can be tackled through the 
consultations between the two countries' airlines, although the 
government can't dictate what policies they will take," he said. 
  Despite Korea's hint at using the Taiwan option, it remains 
to be seen whether it will actually use it if the future talks 
don't promise much since China is the only remaining upscale 
market Korea's airlines can exploit. 
  In addition, preventing Korea's strong hand is China's 
aviation policy that bans airlines flying to Taiwan, from 
serving Chinese routes.

  [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- The Communications 
Ministry sent a delegation to China Monday to discuss Korea's 
participation in projects for building a communications network 
in Hunan Province and laying a 3,600-kilometer fiber optic cable 
between Beijing and Guangzhou. 
  Bilateral cooperation in the two projects was agreed on at a 
summit between South Korea and China and at a communications 
ministers' meeting in late March. 
  Hunan Province is asking Seoul for a 40-million-dollar loan 
out of the Economic Development and Cooperation Fund. The 
Chinese Government plans to spend 100 million dollars on the 
fiber optic cable project between Beijing and Guangzhou. 
  The Korean delegation, comprising officials from the 
Communications and Finance Ministries, Korea Telecom and other 
research institutes, will return May 21.

  [Text] Pusan, May 16 (YONHAP) -- Twenty-two South Korean 
fishermen caught by Chinese patrol boats in the East China Sea 
late last month were set free in Shanghai, China Sunday and on 
their way home aboard one of their boats. 
  Eleven of the fishermen are those of Taehung-ho No. 27 and 
the remainder the crew of Songkwang-ho No. 2, both based in 
Pusan. 
  Officials of the National Fisheries Administration and the 
fishery companies they belong to said Monday the 22 fishermen 
are set to arrive in the Pusan harbor on Tuesday afternoon 
aboard Taehung-ho No. 27. 
  It was reported earlier in the day that Korea agreed with 
China to pay 13,728 U.S. dollars in return for their release. 
China earlier demanded 100,000 dollars. 
  Songkwang-ho No. 2 was cut loose after its crews were 
transferred to a Chinese patrol vessel when a nearby South 
Korean fishing boat followed the patrol ship towing Songkwang-ho 
No. 2 during the seizure on April 29.

  [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- Amid the global investment 
rush into China, Korea ranks seventh in the number of businesses 
penetrating the vast market. 
  According to Chinese data, l67,500 enterprises are operating 
in China on a joint-venture or merger basis or independently, 
including 2,321 businesses from Korea. 
  Hong Kong ranked first with l06,900 firms operating in 
China, 
followed by 20,600 from Taiwan, ll,500 from the United States, 
7,000 from Japan, 4,100 from Macao and 3,000 from Singapore. 
  Of the foreign business firms, 25,500 were merged and 34,000 
were 100-percent foreign invested, with the rest being joint 
ventures. 
  Guangdong Province had the most foreign companies with 
44,700, followed by Jiangsu Province with 18,000. The next 
provinces in order were Shandong, Fujian, Zhejiang and Shanghai 
City. 
  Foreign investment in China has been increasing rapidly in 
recent years. A total of 83,100 firms advanced into China in 
1993 compared with 11,800 in 1991 and 47,100 in 1992. 
  Of the 7,000 large-scale projects exceeding 10 million 
dollars, 4,000 cases occurred in 1993 alone, a 2.6 times 
increase over the previous year. 
  Business circles forecast that, reflecting China's high 
economic growth, foreign investment will continue to boom with 
money pouring in from the United States and European Countries, 
drawn by Chinese efforts to attract more foreign enterprises.

<F P=106> [Robert Guest report: "BAe Wins 39m pound Seoul Arms Deal"] </F>
  [Text] Seoul -- South Korea decided yesterday to award a 
39 million pound contract to equip its destroyers with command 
and firing control systems to a joint British-French company. 
  The Surface Ship Combat System Mark 7 (SSCS), made by 
BAe-Sema [British Aerospace-French Electronics Group] processes 
battle data, enabling a destroyer to detect, target and 
neutralise enemy vessels before they can retaliate. 
  South Korea's Defence Ministry said it chose BAe-Sema's 
system over a rival German model, Cosys-200 Kl, because the 
British product is better value, has superior logistical support 
and because the Royal Navy had decided to develop a compatible 
system. 
  The deal may be a sign that Seoul's arms procurement 
programme is being revived after a bribery scandal left it 
paralysed last year. 
  Seoul had been expected to opt for the SSCS Mk7 last summer 
but the Defence Ministry said the decision was delayed "due to 
problems arising from the credibility of the British 
manufacturer". 
  Military analysts believe the real reason for the delay was 
quite different. At the time the deal was being discussed, the 
reformist government of President Kim yong-sam was conducting a 
colossal purge of the remnants of the previous military-backed 
regime. 
  In the purge last year, 39 generals, two former defence 
ministers and a former naval chief of staff were sacked, 
reprimanded or jailed for "selling" promotions or taking 
kickbacks from arms manufacturers. 
  At such a time, no one wanted to be seen signing a 
multi-million-pound purchase order for fear that prosecutors 
might question their motives and subject their personal finances 
to an audit. 
  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the government spent a third 
of its budget on defence to deter any possible aggression from 
the hostile North. 
  The volume of money that was poured into the South Korean 
military was matched by the secrecy surrounding the way it was 
spent. Parliament had no right to scrutinise the military 
accounts, and corruption among senior officers was consequently 
rife. 
  Few high-ranking members of the old military government 
would 
emerge unscathed from a rigorous financial probe.

  [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- The air force took 
delivery of an undisclosed number of all-weather medium-sized 
CN-235m transport planes from Spain in a ceremony held at a base 
near Pusan Thursday afternoon, with Chief of Staff Gen. Kim 
Hong-nae and other ranking officers attending. 
  The aircraft, manufactured by Casa Co. of Spain according to 
U.S. Air Force technical and operational requirements, will 
replace C-54 and -123 [as received] planes to improve the 
country's military transport capability. 
  Gen. Kim, saying modern warfare hinges on military transport 
operations, exhorted the air force to train for early tactical 
deployment and operation of the new transport planes. 
  The CN-235m can conduct all airborne operations such as 
drops 
of paratroopers, military supplies and flares in inclement 
weather and at night, as it is equipped with an inertial 
navigational system, a satellite navigational data receiver, a 
weather radar system and an electronic countermeasure system. 
  It can carry 48 armed troops and 4,989 kg of supplies and 
fly 
for 10 hours at a cruising speed of 398 km per hour. Its 
maximum altitude is 9.14 km, cruising range 3,314 km and maximum 
takeoff load 16,465 kg. 
  Casa started developing the CN-235m in 1980, test-flew it in 
1983 and began commercial production in 1986. It has thus far 
sold 140 of this aircraft, including 41 for civilian use, to 16 
countries. 
  The air force, under a plan to improve its military 
transport 
capability begun in 1989, selected in April 1992 the CN-235m to 
replace the obsolete C-54 and -123 aircraft after a comparative 
examination of this model and Italy's G-222 model. 
  When deployed, the new transport aircraft will carry out 
normal military transport operations as well as such special 
missions as anti-irregular warfare, rescue and airlift 
operations to special areas.

  [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Russia wants to repay part 
of its overdue debt to South Korea by offering a building site 
for the Korea-Russia Trade Center, the Korea Trade Promotion 
Corp. (KOTRA) said Thursday. 
  The Russian Government has decided in principle to give 
Korea 
5 hectares (15,000 pyong) of land currently reserved for the use 
of Moscow University for the trade center in exchange for some 
of its outstanding liabilities, and is discussing details with 
the Moscow city hall. 
  City officials and university authorities are said to 
strongly oppose the plan, but the government favors the idea and 
is likely to look for other sites if it cannot get the land, 
KOTRA officials said. 
  If Seoul accepts Moscow's proposal at a joint economic 
committee meeting slated for May 19-23 here, repayment of some 
of Russia's liabilities with Korea will be resolved. 
  KOTRA, however, has its heart set on the land owned by the 
university campus and may seek to locate the trade center there 
without linking it with Korea's loans to Russia, officials said. 
  "We exchanged a memorandum of understanding with Moscow city 
and the university last month to set up a trade center within 
the university," an official said. 
  The memorandum was signed without any linkage to the loan so 
the Seoul Government can decide whether to attach the matter to 
the loan repayment, he said. 
  KOTRA, regardless of the outcome of the project's linkage to 
the loan, is sounding out local companies to determine their 
interest in the center. Such firms as Dongbu, Daelim and 
Byoksan have shown an affirmative response. 
  The center will be comprised of four sectors -- exhibition, 
department store, hotel and apartments -- and is expected to 
cost 300 million U.S. dollars. 
  Seoul had failed to settle some of the loan repayment with 
rent for the Korean industrial complex in Nakhodka due to 
opposition from Moscow. 
  Korea loaned 1.27 billion dollars in economic aid to the 
former Soviet Union and interest on the outstanding liabilites 
had reached 387 million dollars as of the end of last year.

  [Text] Kwangju, South Korea, May 18 (YONHAP) -- Some 20,000 
citizens and students marked the 14th anniversary of the civil 
uprising for democracy here in 1980 in a ceremony held in the 
provincial government plaza on Wednesday afternoon. 
  Kang Shin-sok, chairman of the 14th anniversary organizing 
committee, called for investigation into the truth of a bloody 
clash between pro-democracy demonstrators and Army martial law 
troops that killed and injured hundreds of citizens and 
students, saying the Kwangju problem would not be settled 
without shedding light on the truth and punishing those 
responsible for the killing. 
  The participants resolved to oppose the United States 
pressing for market opening and arms import and have all 
democratic forces united for national reunification. 
  Earlier in the day, over 5,000 people paid tribute to the 
victims of the uprising in a memorial service held in the 
Mangwol-tong Cemetery, while demanding punishiment of those 
responsible for the killing and investigating into the truth of 
the killing. 
  The late Park Kwan-hyon, who was killed while leading a 
student demonstration as president of the Chonnam National 
University student government 14 years ago, and Yun Chom-sun 
were given the Kwangju Citizens' Prize. Yun has been active in 
democratization movements over the past 14 years, while 
supporting her mother who suffered an eye wound and lost her 
sight during the uprising. 
  Memorial services were also held in Catholic and Protestant 
churches. 
  The police deployed some 8,000 riot policemen at major 
points 
of the city to prepare for an emergency.

<F P=106> [Report by Yi Sang-ki] </F>
  [Text] During the military regime period, most military 
personnel was from the Taegu and North Kyongsang Province [TK] 
area and Chungchong Province centering on the Hanahoe. Since 
the Kim Yong-sam government set sail, however, military generals 
from Pusan and South Kyongsang Provinces [PK], which is 
President Kim's hometown as well as his political base of 
operation, are increasingly apparent. 
  Moreover, generals from the PK region occupy key positions 
in 
the military where there is the possibility of exercising 
influence on those from these regions. Officers point out that 
this is greatly hindering military harmony and morale. 
  Military authorities state: "The government's military 
personnel reform is focused on excluding the members of Hanahoe. 
However, to choose generals from the Pusan and South Kyongsang 
Province region regardless of their capability and temperament 
is the same as when the Hanahoe monopolized the military in the 
past." They also express the worry that intervention in 
military personnel changes by Chongwadae [presidential offices] 
aides and authority figures is the same as when Chongwadae's 
Security Service intervened in the past. 
  Currently, Chongwadae and the Ministry of Defense is 
influencing the military. Those from the PK region occupy an 
absolute advantage over those from other regions in key posts in 
each military headquarters. Pak Kwan-yong, Chongwadae's chief 
secretary, graduated from Tongnae High School in Pusan; and 
Chong Chong-uk, assistant to the president for foreign and 
national security affairs, graduated from Pusan High School. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae graduated from Kyongnam High 
School, where President Kim also graduated. Regardless of a 
small number of military officers from this school, during 
personnel changes last spring military officers, including 
Brigadier General Pyon Ho-in, who graduated from the 24th class 
of the Military Academy, was promoted to major general and now 
occupies a position in the key division of the capital district. 
While appointing generals to take command of a division of the 
capital district, almost all of those who graduated from 
Kyongnam High School were promoted. Those who graduated from 
Kyongnam High School include Major General Chon Sang-pae from 
the 22d class of the Military Academy, who is the chief of staff 
of intelligence of the ROK Army Headquarters; Maj. Gen. An 
Song-yong from the 23d class of the Military Academy, who is the 
commander of a division in the capital district; and Pak No-suk 
from the 24th class of the Military Academy, who is the chief 
secretary of the Chief of Staff of the ROK Army. 
  In the past military government the main current of the 
military was the TK faction, as well as those who graduated from 
Pusan High School. Even in the Kim government, those who 
graduated from Pusan High School occupy key positions including 
the Chongwadae and the military. Gen. Yun Yong-nam from the 
19th class of the Military Academy, who is the commander of the 
three armed services; Yu Chong-kap, who was promoted to 
lieutenant general in April, is the director of intelligence 
headquarters under the Defense Military; Maj. Gen. Han Sung-ui 
from the 22d class of the Military Academy, who is the policy 
and planning officer of the Defense Ministry; and Yi Ui-se from 
the 22d class of the Military Academy, who is the commander of 
an intelligence command, are all from Pusan High School. 
  Military figures from Pusan and South Kyongsang Provinces 
are 
regarded as those who hold key positions under the current 
government through school and regional connections. Lieutenant 
Gen. Yi Yu-su from the 20th class of the Military Academy, who 
was promoted to head of the field Army; Maj. Gen. Cho Yong-nae 
from the 177th class of the class-A officers' candidate school; 
and Maj. Gen. Kim Hui-sang from the 24th class of the Military 
Academy, were promoted to divisional commander by the new 
government. Four to five high-ranking cadres, including 
Commander Yim Chae-mun from the third class of the Reserve 
Officers' Training Corps of the Defense Security Command, are 
from Pusan and South Kyongsang Provinces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam government is inclined to exclude almost 
all 
of the TK figures from military personnel changes. In October's 
regular personnel change, not one person out of the 20 from the 
TK region were promoted to lieutenant general and major general. 
In the April personnel change, only one person out of the 13 
was promoted from this region. A Defense Ministry colonel 
expressed dissatisfaction by saying: "Whenever the opportunity 
arises, the military supreme command states that military morale 
is higher than ever before. Nevertheless, mainly officers from 
the president's hometown are chosen for key posts and 
promotions. It seems that the military as a force for a 
possible coup d'etat is still recognized." 
  Another problem is that Chongwadae aides and the president's 
closest aides are interfering in military personnel changes. 
People who have a good knowledge of military personnel reveal 
that since the inauguration of the Kim regime, outside pressure 
for military personnel changes takes places with each passing 
day. An unidentified general said: "Since the last period of 
last year, the president's direct family members, who have no 
relation with the military, have been meeting with high-ranking 
military generals and interfering in military affairs, including 
personnel changes. A popular joke among the generals these days 
is that if you have not met any of the president's family 
members, you are an impostor."

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Pang-hui: "Defense Industry on a </F>
Ruinous Road and the Collapse of a Self-Reliant National 
Defense"] 
  [Text] "Turn cannonballs into coins." This is not a mere 
euphemism to describe an era when economic war has replaced the 
cold war; This describes the urgent situation in which ROK 
defense-industry companies have no choice but to make changes on 
their own. 
  Pungsan virtually led the ROK defense industry, and its main 
business was manufacturing. However, domestic demand for 
artillery shells plummeted, and as a result, the company faced a 
serious management crisis. Consequently, it is drastically 
curtailing its facilities for producing defense-industry 
materials. It is also cutting its work force for the defense 
industry by 800 a year. The company is making coins in the 
United States by using knowhow gained from manufacturing copper 
artillery shells. 
<H5>  Past Special Privileges Are Now a Form of Bondage </H5>
  Approximately 80 defense-industry companies, including 
Pungsan, are now facing difficulties in management primarily 
because domestic demand for conventional weapons has almost been 
met. The domestic defense-industry companies are now operated 
at close to 40 percent of capacity. 
  Similarities between defense-industry companies and ordinary 
companies end when it comes to their difficulties in management. 
Defense-industry companies cannot freely close their shops. 
This is due to the legacy of a special government policy for 
the defense-industry companies. 
  If a defense-industry company facing serious management 
difficulties wants to dismantle facilities used exclusively for 
the defense industry, it must obtain approval from the 
government under the Special Law for Fostering the Defense 
Industry. This law was promulgated in 1973 and has made it 
possible for the government to give various forms of assistance 
to defense-industry companies. This special treatment has turned 
into a form of bondage. 
  Of course, even if defense-industry companies freely 
dismantle defense-related facilities and relocate workers to 
other areas, the government has no effective means to punish 
those companies. In fact, since the mid-1980's many 
defense-industry companies have dismantled defense-related 
facilities in disregard of the law. 
  Companies that manufacture firearms, shells, mobile 
equipment, and other weapons and small and medium-size companies 
have a strong tendency to dismantle defense-related facilities. 
Even big companies that were over 20 percent defense 
industry-related have reduced defense activities to less than 10 
percent. The president of a defense-industry subsidiary of a 
big business group says: "General sentiment in this industry is 
that the defense industry is a shortcut to ruin." 
<H5>  "Almost All Defense-Industry Companies Will Disappear in </H5>
Three to Four Years" 
  Under these circumstances, Paek Yong-hun, chairman of the 
Defense Industry Association and director of the Korea 
Industrial Development Institute, says: "Almost all companies 
that manufacture basic military weapons will disappear in three 
to four years. Is it all right for defense-industry companies 
to disappear like this?" 
  It is not its share in the ROK economy that makes the 
defense 
industry important. Even though exact statistics are not 
available, the net sales of the defense industry were close to 
28 trillion won in 1990. The most serious problem of our 
defense industry is that even though various countries of the 
world are curtailing this "industry of death," we are not in a 
position to do so. 
  This is why the government cannot do anything about this 
industry. Representatives of the defense industry who attended 
the 15 April "high-level policy meeting to foster the defense 
industry" asked the government to make some sort of decision 
with regard to the defense industry. 
  What would happen if defense industrial companies that 
produce basic weapons were to disappear from our country? The 
government would lose not only the capability of supplying basic 
weapons in an emergency, but also not be able to procure the 
sources for the spare parts necessary in manufacturing basic 
weapons. This will then result in reducing the country's 
self-defense capability. The defense industry has an aspect 
which cannot be judged from a viewpoint of mere economic logic 
just like at the time when we began to develop this industry 25 
years ago. 
  Another aspect of the defense industry is that unlike other 
industries, this industry has no room to grow. In other words, 
today, when heavy and chemical industries, which were once 
deemed failures have returned to the stage of success, only the 
defense industry is in a state of decline. This is because 
there is not gateway out. In other words, the defense industry 
can not grow like other industries because it lacks export 
activities. 
<H5>  The United States Has Been Stingy in Transferring High </H5>
Technology to the ROK 
  Exports in the defense industry were actually blocked by 
restrictions imposed by the United States. The National Defense 
Ministry has not officially made public the balance of payments 
in the defense industry sector. However, it has been learned 
that the defense industry sector accumulated debts of over $2 
billion in the nineties. In the eighties, the deficit amounted 
only to $1 billion. 
  The defense industry's domestic demand has been met, and 
exports have been blocked. Such being the situation, the future 
of our defense industry is very dark and gloomy. The "Report on 
Military Cooperation and Competition Between the United States 
and Allied Countries For 1992" of the U.S. Congress' Military 
Technology Evaluation Committee which was conveyed to the 
National Defense Minitry via the American Embassy in Seoul, 
indicates the following in connection with the ROK defense 
industry: "The ROK's basic purpose is to maintain the present 
defense industry and to achieve complete self-reliance in weapon 
production capability. 
  "However, it will be difficult to achieve this by the next 
century." 
  While this report properly reveals the vulnerability of the 
ROK defense industry, it foresees that the ROK defense industry 
will be completely self-reliant in weapons production capability 
by the next century, and this is too optimistic a view of the 
future of the ROK defense industry. 
  Admittedly, the domestic defense industry has made equally 
rapid progress as the other industries. The ROK has become the 
only country which has become self-reliant in the production of 
basic weapons in the short period of less than 10 years. It is 
not too much to say that the ROK's success in the defense 
industry sector was realized from its "tactic of relying on" the 
United States. The ROK began to rapidly develop the defense 
industry by receiving grant-type military aid, loans from 
foreign military sales [FMS], and military technology materials 
[TDP] from the United States as early as in the fifties. 
  In particular, data on U.S. military technology provided by 
the United States since 1971 has been the main source for the 
ROK to attain U.S. military technology. Data for over 1,000 
such cases of U.S. military technology was transferred from the 
United States to the ROK thus far, and this can be evaluated as 
having greatly contributed to the development and production of 
as many as 200 different types of weapons in our country. This 
data has greatly contributed to developing Korean-type arms such 
as Korean-type armored vehicles and Korean-type tanks in 
particular. 
  Besides the technological aspect, the ROK defense 
industry's dependence on the United States is great. Among 
other things, over 70 percent of the weapons the ROK purchases 
from abroad are of U.S. origin. Moreover, the ROK defense 
industry has been producing the weapons of U.S. origin through 
technological licence agreement or has been producing them 
jointly with the United States since the seventies. Since it 
began producing M16 rifles through a licence agreement in 1971, 
the ROK defense industry has produced M60 light machine-guns and 
various kinds of communications equipment through licensing 
agreements. This led to our attainment of complete local 
production of this type of the weaponry. 
  In the 1980's, the ROK began the off-set program [as 
published] with the United States and has since then actively 
pushed ahead with joint production. The defense industry, which 
has jointly produced some basic weaponry, has been making 
considerable progress in the area of aircraft production. The 
defense industry has produced F-5E/F fighter-bombers and 500MD 
helicopters jointly with the United States, and is jointly 
producing F-16's at present. 
  The problem in our cooperation with the United States in 
defense industry is that our dependence on the United States has 
become too great. This problem has become even more burdensome 
since the 1980's when the U.S. Government and the U.S. defense 
industry began to regard the ROK defense industry as a 
competitor. There has been discord between the ROK and the 
United States over U.S. restriction of ROK weapons exports, 
transfer of advanced military technology, opening up of the 
defense industry market, and compromise trade [cholchung kyoyok]. 
  For instance, the United States, while providing the ROK 
with 
military technology data, has been stingy in providing data for 
relatively advanced technology, such as in aviation and marine 
and submarine guided weapons systems. Up to 1990, not more than 
10 technological transfers were made in these areas. Moreover, 
the ROK Government has requested that the United States conduct 
joint research and development or joint production for key 
technology transfer of defense industry, but little progress has 
been made so far. In the latter half of the 1980's, the ROK 
submitted a request for U.S. technology related to laser and 
guided weapons and detection of submarines and sound, which the 
United States rejected. 
  No doubt, it would be most desirable if the ROK could 
develop 
advanced weapons and technology on its own. However, reality is 
not that simple. For instance, key technologies designated by 
the Defense Institute [as published] as high precision weapons 
that need to be procured by the 2000's, were already being used 
in the United States in the latter half of the eighties. 
  In view of the level of ROK science and technology and its 
capability of acquiring funds for research and development, 
independent development is not easy. Hwang Tong-chun, policy 
development officer of the Defense Research Institute, said that 
in this respect, the ROK-U.S. defense industrial cooperation 
will be an important factor that will determine the fate of the 
local defense industry. 
  How much necessary technology the ROK can obtain with the 
present research and development system is another important 
factor connected with the future of the defense industry. 
Unlike other industries, the National Defense and Science 
Institute, a state policy research institute, has a monopoly on 
the defense industry's research and development. This 
institute's annual budget is estimated to be about 200 billion 
won, of which about 60 percent is allocated to defense industry 
businesses for development and production. 
  Whether this monopolistic system in research and 
development is appropriate in view of the trend of the defense 
industry which is attaching increasing importance to technology 
that can be used both for civilian and military purposes is 
subject to controversy. A considerable number of experts assert 
that a considerable number of the 800 projects which the 
institute is charged with should be transferred to civilian 
businesses, but the institute refused to comment on this 
assertion. 
<H5>  Judgment Based on Economic Theory Is Hardly Workable </H5>
  The perspective on the defense industry has changed 
drastically from the seventies to the eighties. During the 
former, the defense industry was seen from a perspective of 
national survival rather than economic theory. This was the 
logic former President Pak Chong-hui upheld in cultivating 
defense industry. Former President Chon Tu-hwan, however, 
asserted that economic logic be applied to the defense industry 
as well, following the advice of economic aides and ministers 
whom he favored. 
  Depending on the weight placed on either of the two 
assertions, the defense industrial experts can be divided into 
two groups--one favoring local development and production, and 
the other favoring overseas purchase. The former's assertion is 
that in order to cultivate the local defense industry, we should 
produce weapons locally through our own research and 
development. On the other hand, the latter's assertion is that 
we should not hesitate to purchase weapons from abroad if we are 
unable to have relative superiority in local development. 
  At one time, the two differing approaches were referred to 
as 
the "Taejon faction view" and the "Hongnung faction view" 
according to the organizations they belonged. Taejon was home 
to the National Defense and Science Institute (ADD) [as 
published], while Hongnung was home to the Korea Institute of 
Defense Administration (KIDA). The two organizations have been 
feuding since the early eighties when researchers of the 
National Defense and Science Institute were dismissed en masse 
according to former President Chon Tu-hwan's instructions. This 
difference in view is considered to persist today. 
  According to defense experts, whichever view assumes greater 
weight, a view for the nineties needs to be formed, as the lack 
of principle in the defense industry will result in the collapse 
of this important industy, which, in turn, could result in a 
fatal defect in the ROK's self-defense capabilities. 
  An even more difficult point is that conclusions regarding 
the defense industry should not come from the working level 
officials of the Defense Ministry. An Pyong-kil, second 
assistant defense minister, said, "The Defense Ministry's 
coordination ability regarding defense industry policy is 
limited," and added, "The problem of defense industry should be 
reviewed from an entirely different perspective starting from 
scratch."

  [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- The opposition Democratic 
Party (DP) has decided to exclude former and incumbent 
presidents as well as incumbent lawmakers and senior officials 
from the former No Tae-u government in selecting witnesses for 
the first stage of parliament's investigation into the Sangmudae 
scandal. 
  Members of the Party's Supreme Committee met Monday morning 
and agreed to make the compromise in an effort to get the 
investigation started as soon as possible. 
  The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) and the DP have 
held a series of consultations but failed to reach a compromise 
on who should testify in the parliamentary probe. 
  Chongwoo Construction Co. allegedly set up a slush fund 
while 
carrying out an Army project to relocate training facilities in 
Sangmudae, Kwangju. 
  The DP alleges that the fund was established to supply 
bribes 
to ranking officials of the previous administration and for 
political contributions to Kim Yong-sam during the 1992 
presidential election. 
  The opposition party plans to begin the parliamentary probe 
first by questioning 30 witnesses that it agreed with the DLP to 
question: It will demand that more people testify if it is 
disclosed that those who were excluded from selection were 
involved in the scandal. 
  Furthermore, the DP has decided to demand 20 more days for 
the probe, in addition to the 20 days already agreed with the 
DLP, considering that the period is too short for parliament to 
conduct a thorough investigation.

  [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- Eleven government 
officials have been arrested and sued on charges of taking 
bribes while they were assigned to the Taejon Expo organizing 
committee between 1991 and 1993, the public prosecution 
announced Monday. 
  Kim Ki-yop, currently working at the Ministry of Trade, 
Industry and Energy, received bribes totaling 41 million won 
(about 50,000 U.S. dollars) from nine business firms while 
serving as sponsor program chief of the Expo organizing 
committee, the announcement said. 
  The prosecution has also obtained arrest warrants for Chon 
So-myong, former landscaping section chief of the organizing 
committee, and Kim U-hyon, former utilities section chief of the 
committee, on the same charges and placed them on a wanted list 
as they have disappeared. 
  In addition, the prosecution found that 26 officials had 
taken bribes of up to 7 million won while they were serving on 
the organizing committee and referred them to the agencies 
currently employing them for disciplinary action. 
  The officials involved in the Expo bribery cases now work at 
10 government ministries and agencies -- the Education, 
Construction, Trade, Industry and Energy, Communications, 
Government Administration and Culture-sports ministries, the 
Economic Planning Board, the Office of Supply, the Korea 
Industrial Property Office and Taejon City Hall.

  [Text] Opposition parties yesterday criticized harshly Kim 
Chong-pil, chairman of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
(DLP), who made a remark justifying the May 16 military coup in 
1961. 
  The major opposition Democratic Party (DP) charged that Kim 
distorted history by calling the May 16 coup a "military 
revolution." 
  "It is absurd for the chairman of the DLP, which alleged it 
succeeded to the spirit of the April 19 Revolution, to say that 
it succeeded to the May 16 military coup, too," Pak Chi-won, DP 
spokesman, said. 
  He further said, "Kim's remark was a mockery against 
history, 
a deceit against the people and a challenge to President Kim 
Yong-sam, who concurrently heads the DLP." 
  Saying that the Pak Chong-hui regime self-disintegrated 
because of inner contradictions of dictatorship, Kim Su-il, 
spokesman of the splinter United People's Party, said, "Kim 
Chong-pil should retire from the political world." 
  In a lecture to students in a high school in Seoul Friday, 
Kim said what he terms the May 16 revolution was planned and 
carried out to develop the nation's economy above all else as a 
precondition for enhancing democracy. 
  The late President Pak, then an Army major general, and his 
military followers including Kim ousted the then democratic 
government led by Prime Minister John M. Chang through a coup on 
May 16, 1961, and took power. 
  The Chang government was founded based on the student 
revolution of April 19, 1660, which overthrew the Syngman Rhee 
dictatorship. 
  Last November, President Kim, who was inaugurated in 
February 
1993 after about 30 years of authoritarian rule by military 
general-turned-presidents, defined the May 16 incident as a 
military coup while the April 19 uprising was termed a 
revolution.

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- Labor-management wage 
negotiations have been settled an average of two weeks earlier 
than in 1993 and this year's pay hikes are higher, the Trade, 
Industry and Energy Ministry said Saturday. 
  As of May 11, out of the 5,483 workplaces with 100 or more 
employees around the country, wages had been agreed at 1,323 
workplaces for a settlement rate of 24.1 percent. On the same 
date last year, the ratio stood at 16.7 percent. 
  Among the workplaces which have settled wage negotiations, 
the average salary hike came to 5.9 percent, up 1.4 percentage 
point from 4.5 percent last year. Among the 30 major business 
groups, 57 of 392 workplaces have settled wage talks for a 
settlement rate of 24.1 percent, compared with 12.2 percent last 
year. 
  Labor unions are demanding different wage hikes according to 
the category of business. Automobile unions called for a 15-16 
percent rise and shipbuilding unions demanded an increase of 
12-13 percent, but these figures are 5-6 percentage points below 
those of last year. 
  Meanwhile, labor unions in the Hyundai and Daewoo business 
groups plan to withdraw from the Federation of Korean Trade 
Unions, and there is a movement toward forming a stronger 
federation of labor unions.

  [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- Korea is close to 
producing key semiconductor parts completely on its own, 
industry sources said Monday. 
  POSCO-huls, an affiliate of Pohang Iron and Steel Co., 
Lucky-Goldstar Group's Siltron and Poongsan Precision are 
gearing up to develop silicone wafers and semiconductor lead 
frames in preparation for mass production of 16 Megabyte Dynamic 
Random Access (DRAM) memory chips from the second half of the 
year. 
  POSCO-huls is poised to step up production of its eight-inch 
wafers to reach annual capacity of 35 million square inches by 
year-end and 60 million square inches by next year to meet the 
demand for 16 M-DRAM chips. 
  Predicting the mainstay of semiconductor production will 
shift to 16 M-DRAM next year from 4 M-DRAM, the company will 
change its wafer production ratio of 4 M-DRAM and 16 M-DRAM to 
4:6 from the current 6:4. 
  Siltron, which concentrates on six-inch wafers making up 4 
M-DRAM chips, will make 40 million square inches of eight-inch 
wafers by late this year so as to localize 90 percent of the 
material, which is currently more than 50-percent dependent on 
imports. 
  Poongsan Precision, which succeeded in developing a 
super-thin lead frame enveloping ASIC (Application-Specific 
Integrated Circuit), will install stamping facilities to mass 
produce lead frames for 16 M-DRAM chips by the end of this year. 
  Dongbu Steel is reportedly preparing to make polycrystalline 
silicone from next year since it is ready to begin manufacturing 
its main material, trichloro-silica.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate commentaries to the 14th anniversary of the heroic 
Kwangju popular uprising in May 1980. 
  It was a just anti-imperialist, anti-fascist resistance to 
thwart the criminal acts of the U.S. imperialists and their 
servants the Chon Tu-hwan-No Tae-u fascist group and achieve 
independence, democracy and reunification, and a mass armed 
uprising in which the people fought a death-defying struggle in 
the teeth of repression by huge armed forces. 
  NODONG SINMUN says the uprising left a precious lesson that 
if the South Korean people are to smash the armed crackdown of 
the oppressors and win a final victory, they must courageously 
wage an all-people anti-U.S. struggle for independence to 
terminate the colonial rule of the United States. 
  The news analyst says: 
  It was the lesson learned by the Kwangju resistance fighters 
and South Korean people at the cost of blood and the sum total 
of the struggle that as long as the United States occupies South 
Korea and the flunkeyist traitors and bellicose elements remain 
in power, independence, democracy and reunification cannot be 
expected nor can the scourge of nuclear war be averted. 
  The South Korean students and people of all walks of life 
must firmly unite under the banner of anti-imperialism and 
independence and more vigorously wage the anti-U.S., anti-war 
and anti-nuclear weapon struggle to overthrow the vicious 
colonial rule of the United States, establish the sovereignty of 
the nation, check and frustrate the nuclear war provocation 
moves of the United States and realise peace and security. 
  All parties, groupings and people of South Korea and 
overseas 
compatriots must courageously wage a nationwide struggle to 
reunify the country through a confederacy in accordance with the 
ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation put 
forward by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the lodestar 
of national reunification, actively support the patriotic 
proposal of the North for the convocation of a national 
conference and turn out as one in the efforts to realise it. 
  An analyst of MINJU CHOSON warns that if the Kim Yong-sam 
group fails to lend an ear to the voices of the people and 
thoroughly and correctly solve the Kwangju problem, it will 
encounter a greater resistance of the people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Chong-pil, "chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party" of South 
Korea, again claimed recently that the "May 16 military coup" 
was a "revolution". 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today brands 
this 
as a shameless and brazen nonsensical balderdash. 
  The analyst says: 
  The "May 16 military coup" was an anti-democratic crime 
which 
blocked democratic development in South Korea and brought a more 
brutal military fascist dictatorship. 
  The "May 16 military coup" staged under the manipulation of 
the United States and the military fascist dictatorship produced 
by it imposed formidable misfortunes and disasters upon the 
people and left incurable wounds of grievances in their hearts. 
This was why the traitor Kim Chong-pil invited angry rebuffs 
from the mass when he defended the "May 16 military coup" 
last year. 
  Nevertheless, he again praised the military coup. This is, 
indeed, an unpardonable challenge to the people's aspiration and 
demand for democracy. He makes such remarks in an effort to 
conceal the past crimes he committed against the people, but it 
is a foolish act. His face is the wolf's, whether he wears a 
mask, or not. He only reeks of blood. 
  The traitor Kim Chong-pil contended that the present 
"regime" 
has its roots in the soil of "May 16". But he only took the 
"civilian" veil off the South Korean "president", Kim Yong-sam, 
while defending the "May 16 military coup" in which he had 
played the key role. The Kim Yong-sam regime is, in fact, a 
fascist dictatorial regime disguised with the "civilian" veil. 
  Kim Yong-sam once said "May 16" was a "coup". But it has 
become all the clearer that his words were intended to conceal 
the reactionary nature of the "civilian" regime which has its 
roots in the military fascist dictatorship.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- Yi Yong-tok, puppet 
prime minister of South Korea, cried for a strict "security 
measure" against the struggle of students, branding it as 
"illegal violence", according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  This is a repressive order to strangulate the struggle of 
students by frantically wielding the fascist club. 
  The struggle of the South Korean people and students for 
independence, democracy and reunification, an inevitable result 
caused by the colonial fascist rule, cannot be "illegal 
violence" in any case but it is a just struggle worthy to be 
praised. 
  Yi Yong-tok's cry for ruthless crackdown on this struggle is 
an unpardonable criminal act becoming only to the fascist 
murderer. 
  It is all the more ludicrous that Yi blared "violent 
demonstration is unjustifiable after the establishment of the 
civilian `government'." It is a complete distortion of the 
reality. 
  The fascist repressive order of the puppet clique proceeds 
from a desperate attempt to bolster up at any cost the "civilian 
government" driven into an extreme crisis by the vigorous 
struggle of the South Korean people against the Kim Yong-sam 
group.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- Pyongyang workers held a 
meeting today supporting the South Korean workers' struggle for 
wage hike. 
  Yi Chu-hyon, chairman of the Pyongyang municipal committee 
of 
the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, said in his 
speech: 
  "The South Korean workers are overdriven for 13-16 hours a 
day to earn far less than the minimum living cost. It is only 
too natural that they rose up in a struggle against the 
authorities' anti-popular predatory and wage curbing policies. 
  "The South Korean rulers, however, let loose numerous riot 
police to disperse rallies and demonstrations by force and 
arrest workers, far from meeting their demand. Nothing has 
changed in the conditions of the South Korean workers after the 
Kim Yong-sam puppet clique came to power." 
  Noting that the South Korean workers are the immediate 
victims of the puppet clique's "strategy for economic recovery" 
and war preparations, the speaker voiced full support and 
solidarity for their struggle against "the civilian" regime's 
anti-popular labour policy and for wage hike and the improvement 
of living conditions. "If the South Korean workers and people 
are to win political freedom and vital rights, they must oust 
the traitor Kim Yong-sam from power and intensify the struggle 
to check the new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists 
and their lackeys and get the U.S. Forces and nuclear weapons 
out of South Korea," he declared. 
  Workers from different industrial establishments in the city 
also took floor at the meeting. 
  They called on the South Korean workers to expand the 
struggle for their vital rights into an anti-kim Yong-sam 
struggle and continue it until their demand was met. 
  Their speeches were frequently interrupted by slogans "Down 
with Kim Yong-sam the traitor to the nation!" "Full support to 
the South Korean workers' struggle for wage hike!" etc.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Japan Has Emerged as a Dangerous Force </F>
of War"] 
  [Text] It is the invariable ambition of Japanese 
reactionaries to realize reinvasion of Korea and their old dream 
of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. 
  Today the Japanese reactionaries, holding a wicked intent to 
become the chief [maengju] of Asia just as the Imperial Army of 
the past, are accelerating Japan's becoming a big military 
power, its armament, and overseas expansion. Thus, Japan has 
become a new hotbed of war. This is proven, first of all, by 
Japan's reorganizing its self-defense forces into leading 
aggressive forces of the world. 
  Japan has already adopted and put into effect the law on 
cooperation for UN peacekeeping activities. With this, Japan 
legalized dispatching of its self-defense forces overseas, and 
is now attempting to create legal conditions for executing a war 
of aggression while raving about amendment of the law on 
self-defense forces and about research and formulation of the 
law on emergency. 
  What one should not overlook in particular is that the 
Japanese Defense Agency is turning the core combat power of its 
ground self-defense forces into the stronghold deployment system 
[kochom paechi cheje] in order to effectively cope with an 
emergency on the Korean peninsula by reviewing the main points 
of the defense plan. 
  This clearly illustrates that the Japanese reactionaries, 
openly exposing their attempt to invade Korea again, are 
accelerating the preparations for reinvasion on a full scale. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' maneuvers of aggression against 
the Korean peninsula have been clearly seen in the fact that 
Japan is dashing to become a big military power and toward 
nuclear armament. 
  Japan is drastically increasing its military expenditure. 
The 
rate of increase in Japanese military expenditure cannot be 
compared to any nation in the West, marking the second highest 
rank in the world in terms of the amount of military expenses. 
  The Japan self-defense forces have grown into a top leading 
aggressive force of the world. The plan of adjusting defense 
power during the period from 1991 to 1995, pushed ahead by the 
Japanese Government, is designed to reinforce self-defense 
forces so that they can independently execute local wars by 
arming them with ultramodern military equipment. 
  Today the Japanese reactionaries claim that Japan is not a 
big military power by pointing to the number of active military 
personnel of the self-defense forces. However, more than 70 
percent of the troops of the self-defense forces consists of 
officers and noncommissioned officers. As the result, Japan's 
self-defense forces will be increased to several millions on a 
single morning in an emergency. 
  The Japanese reactionaries, attaching an importance not only 
to quantitative expansion of armament and equipment of 
self-defense forces but also to their qualitative reinforcement, 
are actively accelerating promotion of fire power, introduction 
of ultramodern technology and equipment, and increase in 
mobility and remote control capability. 
  The Japanese Defense Agency is trying to drastically 
increase the offensive ability of self-defense forces by arming 
them with ultramodern equipment, including war command 
airplanes, Patriot antimissile missiles, new-type tanks, 
large-size transport ships, and aircraft carriers. 
  The Japanese militarists, engrossed with the ambition for 
overseas invasion, have reorganized the defense structure of 
self-defense forces into offensive, and changed their military 
strategy from the total defense strategy to preemptive attack 
strategy. Besides, they expanded their operational zone into 
wide areas in Northeast Asia and the Pacific with the Korean 
peninsula as the center. 
  Furthermore, Japan is running amok with nuclear armament in 
a 
bid to realize the ambition for its overseas expansion by all 
means. As the result, Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers have 
reached a dangerous boundary. 
  As has been widely known to the world, Japan has stockpiled 
scores of tons of plutonium--a basic material for producing 
nuclear weapons--and completed construction of the plant with a 
view to producing a large quantity of plutonium at any time. 
  In addition, Japan has armed self-defense forces with 
various 
artillery guns capable of firing nuclear warheads and with F-15 
fighter-bombers that are capable of loading nuclear bombs. Japan 
has also completed domestic production of cruise missiles that 
are capable of loading both nuclear and conventional warheads. 
By staging test firing of a domestic-produced satellite rocket, 
Japan is creating daily-increasing danger on the Korean 
peninsula and in Northeast Asia. 
  Today the Japanese reactionaries' overseas aggression 
maneuvers have become even more grave. As has already been 
reported, the reactionary Japanese government is scheming to 
provide a legal basis for overseas aggression under a pretext of 
coping with an emergency on the Korean peninsula. 
  In a speech in Washington, Aiichi, former director-general 
of 
the Japanese Defense Agency, confessed that the Japanese 
Government is working measures to cope with an emergency on the 
Korean peninsula, and openly stated that Japan is going to 
establish a crisis management system. The Japanese 
reactionaries' maneuvers for formulating laws for the state of 
emergency and for establishing a crisis management system are 
aimed at invading our country and dispatching of unlimited 
troops overseas, thus arousing worries and concerns of the Asian 
countries. 
  All facts show that the Japanese reactionaries' maneuvers of 
aggression have an extremely haughty nature, and have reached a 
reckless stage. Today our people, the Asian people and the 
peaceloving people of the world, are closely watching with high 
vigilance the military moves of Japan which has emerged as the 
dangerous force of war. 
  The Japanese reactionaries should not forget the historic 
lesson of their disgraceful defeat in the past. They must look 
straight at the trend of the time and act with discretion.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 15 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- An 
emergency meeting on the human rights of the Koreans in Japan 
was held here on May 10. 
  At the meeting, Shigeru Tokoi, chairman of the executive 
committee of the Forum on Human Rights of Koreans in Japan, made 
a report on the recent crackdown on the Osaka Prefectural 
Headquarters of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and its branch offices by the Japanese police. 
  "The search of Chongnyon by the Osaka prefectural police 
took 
place against the background of the Japanese Government 
authorities' moves for effecting `economic sanctions,' 
`emergency legislative arrangements' and `right to collective 
self-defence' on the pretext of `North Korea's nuclear issue'," 
said the appeal which was adopted at the meeting. 
  Political suppression gives rise to new human rights 
violations and national discrimination, the appeal said, adding 
that the recent search and the ensuing violence and outcries 
against the Koreans in Japan are all violations of the human 
rights of the Koreans in Japan, which create a terror-ridden 
atmosphere every day. 
  "We declare with indignation that the national 
discrimination 
and human rights violations against the Koreans in Japan are a 
specially grave and serious problem in Japanese society," said 
the appeal.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 16 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The 
Japan committee for support to the independent and peaceful 
reunification of Korea issued a statement May 13 in protest 
against police search of the General Association of Korean 
Residents in Japan (Chongnyon). 
  The statement branded the recent search of the Osaka 
Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and its branch offices by 
1,000 police in Osaka as an ill-boding high-handed act which 
shows the legal status of the Koreans in Japan is not guaranteed 
at all in Japan. 
  "It is intolerable that unreasonable police repression was 
committed against the Koreans in Japan who should have enjoyed 
special protection by Japanese authorities for historical 
reasons," said the statement, urging the government to take 
measures to immediately revoke police search of Chongnyon. 
  "Since the prime minister of Japan declared at the Diet that 
he repented of Japan's past invasion and colonial rule over 
Korea, the cabinet is committed to carry the repentance into 
practice under the eyes of the people," the statement said. 
  "The Japanese Government must renounce the hostile policy 
toward the DPRK, stop inciting national chauvinism and remember 
that its task is not the military policy for imaginary 
`emergency in Korea' but normalisation of diplomatic relations 
between Japan and the DPRK." 
  The statement called for extending throughout the nation the 
protest campaign against Japanese authorities' repression of 
Chongnyon and the Koreans in Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- "The Korean people owe 
their remarkable progress in socialist construction to the wise 
guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and the immortal chuche idea," 
Choummali Sai-ngason, politburo member of the C.C. [Central 
Committee], the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and defence 
minister of Laos, told KCNA, giving his impressions of Korea. 
  "Korea, the stronghold of socialism, gives great courage to 
the world people," he said. "The Korean people are advancing 
along the road of socialism, not wavering in whatever storm 
because they are equipped with their leader's idea and are 
closely united behind him." 
  He said the U.S.-led imperialists cannot act arbitrarily 
because the Korean people have respected Comrade Kim Il-song as 
their leader, enjoy the wise guidance of the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il and are firmly united around them. 
  "The Laotian people and Army," he declared, "will actively 
support as ever the Korean people in the efforts to defend the 
sovereignty of the country and achieve the independent and 
peaceful Reunification of the country and always fight shoulder 
to shoulder with the Korean people."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- A mass meeting was held 
here Monday on the occasion of a "week of support to struggle of 
Palestinian people." 
  Addressing the meeting, Yi So-yong, vice-chairman of the 
Korean Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, said that the signing of 
an accord of the Palestine self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the 
West Bank's Jericho area between Palestine and Israel on May 4 
was a fruition of the patient efforts of the Palestinian people 
to retake the lost territory and restore their national rights. 
  He wished it would be a basis of building an independent 
state of Palestine and the first step for a fair and 
comprehensive solution to the Middle East issue. 
  Noting that if a durable peace in the Middle East is to be 
preserved, Israel should withdraw from all the occupied Arab 
land and the aggression and intervention of the imperialists in 
this area should be ended, he said: We are convinced that the 
day is sure to come when the Palestinian people will live a 
happy life in their motherland after finally settling the 
Palestinian issue, closely rallied around the PLO. 
  Palestinian ambassador to Korea Shahir Mohammed spoke next. 
  He said that the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il set an outstanding example in 
international support to the just struggle of the Palestinian 
people and they remain true to internationalism. 
  The U.S. imperialists are hatching up falsehood and slanders 
about Korea's development of nuclear weapons, but this is 
nothing but a demagogy to cover their disgusting purpose and 
scheme against Korea, he said, and pointed out: 
  The Palestinian people and the Arab people fully support the 
10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation advanced 
by the great leader for the reunification of Korea, considering 
it a most just and comprehensive one. 
  He supported the DPRK's position to solve the nuclear 
problem. 
  Saying that the Palestinian people will always remain 
faithful friends of the Korean people, he stressed that the 
revolution of the two countries and friendship between the 
peoples fostered by President Yasir 'Arafat and the great leader 
President Kim Il-song will continue to develop in conformity 
with mutual interests in the future, too. 
  A letter to the Palestinian president was adopted at the 
meeting.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- Nine political parties 
and organizations of Bangladesh including the Workers and 
Peasants Socialist Party and the Workers' Party issued a joint 
statement regarding the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  Noting that the U.S. imperialists have deliberately massed 
their Armed Forces and deployed nuclear weapons on the Korean 
peninsula, systematically violated provisions of the Korean 
Armistice Agreement and paralyzed even the armistice observation 
mechanism, the joint statement says: 
  We call upon all the peoples and peaceloving governments of 
all countries to firmly unite to defend world peace and denounce 
the U.S. imperialists' illegal acts of aggression. 
  We consider that the DPRK's proposal to replace the 
Armistice 
Agreement with a peace agreement is justifiable under the 
current situation and practical measures should be taken 
immediately to establish a peace arrangement on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  We will stand firm on the side of the DPRK Government and 
people who have struggled for peace and security on the Korean 
peninsula.

<F P=106> [MINJU CHOSON 22 April editorial: "Let Us Brilliantly </F>
Fulfill the Tasks of the Adjustment Period in Socialist Economic 
Construction"] 
  [Text] The seventh session of the Ninth DPRK Supreme 
People's Assembly [SPA] discussed the issue of successfully 
implementing the task for the adjustment period in socialist 
economic construction set forth by the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK] and adopted a relevant decision. This is a clear 
manifestation of the firm and invariable determination and will 
of the Government of the Republic and all the people to 
brilliantly realize the plans and intent of our party, which has 
established the upcoming three years as a period of adjustment 
in the historic turning point of entering a new high stage of 
socialist construction and set forth a revolutionary economic 
strategy. 
  As unanimously stressed again at the current SPA session, 
the 
task for the adjustment period in socialist economic 
construction set forth by our party is a most correct and 
revolutionary economic strategy that has proceeded from the 
prevailing situation, the changed international circumstances, 
the demands of our developing revolution, and our present 
economic situation. Reflected in the strategy are our party's 
lofty will and revolutionary intent to rapidly improve the 
standard of the people's living and to develop our economy into 
a chuche-oriented economy that is not shaken by any economic 
blockade of the imperialists. 
  Our party's establishment of the adjustment period in 
socialist economic construction and its decision of the 
rewarding tasks to be fulfilled in this period is another proud 
demonstration of the extraordinary leadership ability of our 
party, which has set forth the wise and expedient tactics by 
familiarizing itself with the demands of the developing 
revolution, the rapidly changing situation, and realistic 
possibilities with brilliant wisdom and scientific insight and 
which is constantly leading the revolution and construction 
along a single road of victory by turning adversity into 
prosperity and misfortune into fortune with matchless courage 
and iron-like will. 
  Successfully fulfilling the task of the adjustment period is 
of important significance in constantly advancing socialist 
construction, in firmly defending the popular mass-centered 
socialism of our own style, and in further enhancing its 
superiority and invincible vitality. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: "The 
revolutionary economic strategy established by our party is to 
thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy, the light 
industry-first policy, and the trade-first policy in the 
adjustment period; to firmly give priority to coal industry, 
power industry, and railway transportation, which are the 
leading sectors of the national economy; and to continuously 
develop the metal industry." 
  The task for the adjustment period in socialist economic 
construction set forth by our party is to thoroughly implement 
the agriculture-first policy, the light industry-first policy, 
and the trade-first policy; to firmly give priority to the coal 
industry, power industry, and railway transportation, which are 
the leading sectors of the national economy; and to continue 
developing the metal industry. The basic goal of this 
revolutionary economic strategy is to completely solve the 
problem of the people's living by concentrating all possible 
efforts on developing agriculture, light industry, and trade for 
two to three years to come; to normalize production in all 
sectors by giving priority to the leading sectors of the 
national economy; and, thus, to fully enhance the might of the 
existing economic foundation. 
  The economic task in the adjustment period is a brilliant 
milestone and an honorable revolutionary and rewarding struggle 
task, which promises a new advance in our people's struggle for 
socialist economic construction. 
  When the party's revolutionary economic strategy is 
materialized a new turn will be effected in agriculture, light 
industry, and foreign trade and, thus, our people's 
long-cherished desire to live in tile-roofed houses, eat rice 
and meat soup, and wear silk clothes, will be brilliantly 
realized in the near future, and the people's material and 
cultural life will be more affluent and prosperous in conformity 
with the inherent nature of socialist society. At the same time, 
along with the development in agriculture, light industry, and 
foreign trade, the leading sectors of the national economy will 
be firmly advanced, and metal industry will also vigorously 
develop. As a result of this, other economic sectors will also 
be further strengthened, and our self-reliant economy and its 
might will be extraordinarily strengthened. 
  In this way, our people will be able not only to live 
independently without being shaken by any economic blockade by 
the imperialists, relying on the firmly deepened self-reliant 
economic foundation and the chuche-oriented economic power, but 
also to brilliantly solve their food, clothing, and housing 
problems according to their ideal and desire and to further 
enhance the superiority and might of the popular mass-centered 
socialism of our own style. 
  The economic task for the adjustment period presented by 
the party firmly guarantees a great new upsurge in our country's 
socialist economic construction, as well as guarantees our 
people a worthwhile future. 
  As the brilliant milestone of the adjustment period was 
presented, our people came to have a powerful guarantee for 
actively coping with the prevailing situation and for firmly 
occupying a new attack position to reach higher uplands of 
socialism. 
  Our party's presentation of the task for the adjustment 
period in socialist economic construction is vigorously arousing 
all the people to launch into a new struggle and register heroic 
feats. It also serves as a great encouragement that gives hope 
and faith to the progressive people of the world who is 
advancing toward socialism while dealing a hard blow to 
imperialists and reactionaries who disparage and attack 
socialism. 
  All the working people should brilliantly implement the task 
for the adjustment period in socialist economic construction, 
with great faith and dignity in struggling with revolutionary 
economic strategies under the wise leadership of the great 
leader and the great party. 
  The WPK report on successfully implementing the task for the 
adjustment period in socialist economic construction, which was 
deliberated at the recent SPA meeting, and relevant decisions 
adopted at the meeting are generally reflecting the goals for 
each unit to achieve in implementing the task for the adjustment 
period, the direction to push ahead with the goals, and specific 
measures and means to achieve them. 
  The decisions on general measures to successfully implement 
the task for the adjustment period in socialist economic 
construction, which SPA made after due consideration, are 
obligations that our functionaries and all working people should 
regard as a law, a supreme order, and should completely 
implement. The decisions are also the SPA's task to implement 
through the sublime struggle to realize its aspiration and 
desire to achieve the growth, prosperity, and development of the 
country and to improve the people's welfare. 
  All functionaries and working people should have fresh 
resolution and determination to become vanguards of the rank 
carrying out the worthwhile struggle to implement the economic 
tasks for the adjustment period and to become creators of 
miracles and feats. 
  What is the most important here in struggling for this aim 
is 
to thoroughly understand the party's strategic intent behind the 
presentation of the task for the adjustment period in socialist 
economic construction and to have firm ideological resolution 
and determination to unconditionally implement the task. 
  Our party's strategic intent behind its presentation of the 
task for the adjustment period in socialist economic 
construction is to remarkably elevate the people's living 
standard in a few years, to firmly strengthen the country's 
economy into a chuche-oriented economy that enables us to live 
on our own strength, and to occupy a new attack position to 
reach higher uplands of socialism. Only when we deeply 
understand the party's revolutionary intent, consider it a firm 
faith of ours, and fill ourselves with extraordinary resolution 
and stern fighting spirit to implement it without fail, can we 
successfully implement the immense and worthwhile task for the 
adjustment period in socialist economic construction that we are 
faced with under the grave situation today. 
  With fervent loyalty to the party and the leader, all 
functionaries and working people should make active efforts to 
deeply understand the party's idea and intent and make it their 
flesh and blood, as well as their firm faith. In particular, 
they should sincerely study and learn the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song's teaching and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's remarks regarding the party's new revolutionary 
economic strategy, the great leader's New Year's Address, the 
decisions made at the 21st plenary session of the Sixth WPK 
Central Committee, recently announced party documents regarding 
the party's economic strategies, and the decisions made at the 
recent SPA meeting, so that they can master the basic ideology 
of the party's economic strategies, the strategic tasks, and the 
means to implement them. 
  Along with this, they must brilliantly fulfill without fail 
the tasks for the adjustment period for their sector and their 
unit to all the more firmly consolidate the determination and 
will of magnificently fulfilling the revolutionary intention of 
the party and the leader. In particular, the state economy 
leadership organ and responsible functionaries in the related 
sectors and units must fully entrust their fate to the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and have the firm determination to 
be able to die while on duty defending the revolutionary post. 
With this, they must be the standard bearer and hands and feet 
in upholding the party and the leader to honorably fulfill their 
responsible role as the commanding staff to fulfill the task for 
the adjustment period. 
  Organizing the economic organization work and economic 
management work are a firm guarantee in successfully carrying 
out the task for the adjustment period. 
  Functionaries of each class of the economy leadership organ 
must carefully organize the economic operation and organization 
work to implement a new economic strategy and party policy. 
They must also solve problems in the economic work at the 
appointed time and in a revolutionary way. 
  All sectors and all units including the committees, 
ministries, and administrative and economic committees of the 
provinces must establish strong rules and order that thoroughly 
execute the Administration Council's decisions and instructions 
to realize the party's unitary leadership in the economic work. 
Also, the creativity of each unit must be highly manifested by 
the functionaries under the state's unitary leadership to carry 
out reliably the task for the adjustment period in a 
revolutionary way. 
  From the principle of subordinating everything in 
implementing the party's new economic strategy, the economic 
guiding functionaries must establish the people's economy plan 
from a practical point of view, make it so that it can be 
carried out by the day, by the month, by the quarter, and by the 
indicators without fail, and always command the fight skillfully 
and with aspiration in front of the ranks and set practical 
examples. Along with this, in accordance with the demand of the 
party's economic strategy, the work to supply materials to the 
agricultural, light industry, and foreign trade sectors must be 
unconditionally carried out first, and the rest must be supplied 
to the other sectors. This must be carried out under the 
principle of thoroughly supplying necessary things to the 
leading sectors of the people's economy and the metal industry 
sector. 
  According to the demand of the Taean work system, all the 
economy leadership organs, plants, and enterprises must manage 
and operate the economy scientifically and rationally under the 
collective guidance of the party committee. Also, labor 
management, facility management, materials management, and 
financial management must be improved to all the more highly 
manifest the true superiority of the collective economic 
management operation method. 
  The production and conservation struggle must be vigorously 
carried out in all sectors and all units of the people's economy. 
  With the attitude of a master, the functionaries and workers 
must manage the nation's economic life tenaciously and 
methodically, protect and manage the state's social assets, and 
effectively use idle materials, waste materials, and byproducts. 
Also, the struggle to all the more produce and effectively use 
the existing labor, facilities, and materials must be carried 
out with energy. 
  The functionaries must bear in mind that an important 
reserve 
to produce more and conserve lies in the technological 
innovation. Therefore, they must go deeply into the producers to 
actively bring out their wisdom and creativity, motivate the 
patriotic enthusiasm and abilities of the scientists and 
technicians, and strengthen their creative cooperation with the 
producer masses so that many valuable scientific and technical 
inventions and technological innovations can be put forth. Such 
inventions and innovations must be made to be effectively used 
in production. 
  All sectors of the people's economy must regard the sectors 
of agriculture, light industry, and foreign trade as if it were 
their own work, actively help in these sectors, and vigorously 
carry out an all-people's support movement for these sectors. 
  The slogan of self-reliance and fortitude must be all the 
more highly upheld and thoroughly embodied in fulfilling the 
task for the adjustment period. 
  The party's new economic strategy is no other than the 
strategy of self-reliance and fortitude, and where we carry out 
the work of self-reliance and fortitude lies the road to 
successfully fulfill the task for the adjustment period. 
  All functionaries and working people in all sectors and 
units of the national economy should implement the economic task 
for the adjustment period while overcoming difficulties and 
obstacles, creating necessary things they do not have, and 
finding out what they lack, by displaying the same spirit and 
vigor as demonstrated during the period of anti-Japanese 
revolutionary struggle, the severe days of war, and the great 
Chollima upswing period, upholding the party's militant slogan, 
"Let us vigorously accelerate the general onward march of 
socialism with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
fortitude." 
  The single-hearted unity is the banner of our eternal 
victory 
in both the revolutionary struggle and economic construction. 
  To strengthen the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary 
ranks in every way is the basic guarantee for the successful 
implementation of the task for the adjustment period in 
socialist economic construction under the grave situation, in 
which the maneuver of imperialists and reactionaries to crush 
our Republic becomes all the more unscrupulous as days go by. 
  Our single-hearted unity means all people's unity around the 
party and the leader in ideological will and moral sense of 
duty. It is a firm, vital, and invincible unity that no force 
can break. Limitless is the might of our people, who are firmly 
united as a strong social and political living body with the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center, upholding the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. We can occupy any fortress 
and overcome any obstacle when we extremely strengthen the might 
of this unity. 
  All the people should arm themselves with the chuche-based 
revolutionary view of leader, firmly bear in mind the greatness 
of the party and the leader as an absolute faith, and thoroughly 
prepare themselves to become genuine, loyal, and filial sons and 
daughters who death-defyingly protect and defend the party and 
the leader politically and ideologically in any stormy 
circumstances and faithfully uphold the party's leadership. We 
should fully demonstrate our faithfulness to the leader 
[yongdoja] and more vigorously display the might of our 
revolutionary ranks' single-hearted unity in the course of the 
practice struggle to implement the task for the adjustment 
period in socialist economic construction, upholding the slogan 
of loyalty that we will do what the party decides. 
  The economic task for the adjustment period is heavy and 
immense, and we may be faced with stumbling blocks and trials in 
the course of implementing it. 
  All our people, however, bear deep in their hearts the 
strong 
will and faith that we are not afraid of any obstacle or any 
strong enemy as long as the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is 
with us. We also have the great potential coming from the 
powerful socialist independent economic ground with the 
chuche-oriented industry as the pivot. 
  There is no force in the world that can impair the might of 
our people who are stoutly advancing, filled with faith in 
certain victory and revolutionary optimism, upholding the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song and under the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's wise leadership. 
  Let us all keep on advancing and struggling in the spirit of 
Chollima, plus the speed of the nineties, firmly united around 
the party and the leader, upholding the banner of the three 
revolutions -- ideological, technological, and cultural -- and 
brilliantly implement the task for the adjustment period in 
socialist economic construction to occupy higher uplands of 
socialist construction.

  [Text] A children's food processing unit has newly been 
established at Sinyang Food Processing Plant under the great 
love and consideration of the great leader and our party, and is 
now producing various food for children. 
  All kinds of children's food produced by the plant -- 
including rice powder, vegetable powder, and tangle powder -- 
are good, and powdered bean milk is better than anything else. 
The plant has prepared excellent processing lines with its own 
strength and technology. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il noted: "By vigorously 
carrying out the technological revolution, the light industry 
sector should remodel production facilities after a modern 
style, modernize equipment, make them high-speed, and mechanize 
and automatize processing lines." 
  When the question on providing children with bean milk was 
raised, Sinyang County began to build a facility for producing 
bean milk at the county's food processing plant without 
hesitation. 
  With the desire to timely embody the great leader and the 
party's great love and consideration for children, functionaries 
at the plant tried to find a way to build a modern facility for 
producing bean milk. 
  The county's party committee intensified the party-oriented 
guidance to prepare a modern bean milk production base at the 
food processing plant in accordance with the party's intention, 
by mobilizing functionaries and technicians at the local 
industry sector of the county. 
  Food scientists engaged in light industrial scientific 
research came to the plant to render their active technological 
support in preparing the bean milk production facility. 
Scientists, functionaries of the county, functionaries and 
workers of the plant, technicians, and three revolutions team 
members cooperated together in studying and testing, and 
completed bean milk processing lines one by one, displaying all 
their strength and wisdom. 
  They finally succeeded in producing quality powdered bean 
milk after repeated research and tests. 
  This processing line can be easily introduced into any 
plant. 
The production process is not complicated, but simple. 
  The plant has excellently built these processing lines with 
its own strength with the scientists' active cooperation, and is 
now able to supply quality powdered bean milk to day nurseries 
and kindergartens, which give children powdered bean milk mixed 
with water. Nurseries and kindergartens say they can economize 
labor and traffic expenses since it is easy to transport and 
preserve powdered bean milk. Above all, this food is good for 
children's health since it is digestible, as well as tasty, 
because it is fermented by milk bacillus.

  [Text] Substitute fuel [taeyong yollyo] is being produced 
on a large scale and is being utilized at the Obong cooperative 
farm in Pongsan county. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: "An 
important task in consolidating and developing the results of 
the technical revolution in the rural areas is to complete land 
readjustment and solve the problem of fuel necessary in 
mechanizing the rural economy." 
  Previously, this farm has been using substitute fuel for 
trucks. The functionaries and technicians here who keep in mind 
the party's intention to use more substitute fuel, used 
substitute fuel for tractors as well and are enhancing the rate 
of operation. Therefore, fuel for trucks and tractors in this 
farm are all produced and supplied by substitute fuel, thus 
enhancing the rate of operation. 
  Experience from this cooperative farm shows that any kind of 
work can be done by tractors that use the substitute fuel, which 
will enhance the capability of the work. By operating the 
tractors with substitute fuel at this cooperative farm, large 
amounts of materials were transported every year. Every work 
team and subwork team are using tractors that use substitute 
fuel for harvesting and plowing. This cooperative farm is 
planning to use substitute fuel in plowing all the fields and 
harrowing this year, and is vigorously pushing ahead with this 
project. These days, the fighters for rural mechanization are 
producing more substitute fuel, are enhancing the rate of 
operation of the tractors, and are carrying out quality field 
plowing. 
  In the past, functionaries and technicians here used 
substitute fuel to operate water meter and threshing machines. 
They also used it in irrigating dry fields and in threshing. 
  By making effective use of this experience, functionaries 
here have set the goal this year to use substitute fuel in 
irrigating dry fields, threshing rice and corn, and are 
prudently organizing the work to fulfill such a goal.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The transplantation of 
humus-pot maize seedlings has been stepped up in the rural 
communities of Korea. 
  According to data available at the state agricultural 
commission, 64.2 percent of humus-pot maize seedlings were 
transplanted throughout the country as of May 13. 
  Humus-pot maize seedlings were transplanted in 90 percent of 
the fields in South Hwanghae Province, 87.4 percent in Nampo 
municipality and 86.6 percent in Kaesong municipality. 
  Cooperative farms in South Hwanghae Province are 
transplanting more humus-pot maize seedlings than the daily plan 
by giving precedence to ridging and other process precedent. 
  Cooperative farms in Nampo and Kaesong municipalities 
transplanted humus-pot maize seedlings 1.2 times that in the 
same period of last year, correctly ensuring the number of maize 
plants per phyong (one phyong equals 6 feet square) and a total 
number of maize plants. 
  Cooperative farms in mountainous areas of Chagang and 
Yanggang Provinces transplanted humus-pot maize seedlings in 
many fields in a few days.

  [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: 
We should properly build bases to produce substitute fuels, 
such as methane gas or metanthracite, throughout counties and 
other rural communities and, also, should strive to increase 
substitute fuel production so that tractors, automobiles, and 
agricultural machines can properly use it. 
  Some time ago, we visited a methane gas plant at a village 
located in Taesan-ri, Chongju County. The methane gas plant is 
operated by one person. 
  The plant has a round shape with a ferment room on the 
second 
floor and machine room, compressor room, and supply room on the 
first floor. First, we visited the ferment room. 
  A functionary of the cooperative farm said: "How nice it is 
to build, with our own might, such an outstanding tank to 
produce methane gas!" 
  After hearing from him, we went to the supply room through 
the compressor room. Many pipelines have been laid in the 
supply room to transport gases to automobiles and other 
agricultural machines. 
  Comrade Kim Hyo-song, secretary of the ri party, said that 
"We are widely using methane gas to operate machine facilities." 
According to his remarks, the cooperative farm has properly 
built the base to produce methane gas and, above all, formulated 
plans to use it for use by agricultural machines. Therefore, 
automobiles, rice transplanting machines, weeders, and 
small-sized harvest machines are being operated using the gases. 
  The methane gas production base built by the cooperative 
farm's own might has greatly improved the rural people's 
standard of living. Also, the cooperative farm uses methane gas 
to operate generators. 
  The gas pipelines between the supply room and the rural 
dwellings are connected like a spider's web. 
  We visited a family at No. 10 workshop village, where a 
housewife was preparing a lunch by using a gas stove. We use 
methane gas byproduct as a good quality fertilizer.

<F P=106> [By Associate Hwang Kum-chol, PhD] </F>
  [Text] The Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out the 
following: 
  "Today, our reality is filled with numerous renovations 
and miracles unknown in any other time in history" 
  Huichon is a place of deep significance, well known in the 
history of our nations machine industry and among our people. 
  Surrounded by the lofty peaks of Chogyu Pass, and the 
Myohyang and Pinandok mountain ranges -- 1,000 meters above sea 
level -- the Huichon Basin is the location of Huichon, the 
leader of our country's machine industry. 
  Although it is unknown when people started living here, 
historically, various names for this place have been recorded. 
It is said that during the Koryo period a wisong (a majestic 
castle for stopping the invasions of Japanese pirates) was built 
here, and that afterward it was maintained as a fortress, called 
Chongsaejin. The village there had been called Wiju, but later 
the name was changed to Huiju. It was given this name to signify 
that it was a village whose exploits in driving off the Japanese 
pirates were glorious. Later, during the Yi Dynasty period, it 
was called Huiju County, but this was later changed to Huichon 
County. From this historical data, we can know that Huichon has 
had a long history since ancient times. 
  The reason the history of this place is so long, and the 
reason our ancestors ended up living here, evidently, is that a 
large part of life here is generally related to the Chongchon 
River and the favorable conditions of the river basin. 
  Looking at the natural conditions of Huichon, we can say 
that 
generally it forms a large basin. 
  Therefore, there are many high mountains and passes 
surrounding it. Representative of these, the Chokyu Pass 
mountain range stretches out in the north; the Myohyang Mountain 
range, in the south; following the border with adjacent 
counties, in the north is Taebawui Mountain, Kwangtae Peak, 
Yonmok Mountain, Myongmun Ridge [Kogae], and Tuchop Mountain; in 
the east is Ubi Mountain, Taeam Mountain, Onmu Mountain, Somun 
Peak, and Mudong Peak; in the south is Piro Peak, which is the 
main peak of the Myohyang Mountain Range, Hyangno Peak, Popwang 
Peak, and Saskas Peak; and to the west is Paehwa Mountain and 
Cholsan Mountain. 
  In Huichon also flow large and small rivers and streams: the 
Chongchon River and its tributaries, the Huichon River, 
Chisin-chon, Myongmun-chon, and Pyongwon-chon. 
  The watercourses have clear, clean water. Here are many 
silver fish, carp, cornet fish, yare, and other fishes. Not only 
this, but the watercourses have a large volume and the 
conditions whereby a head can be obtained, making them favorable 
for water-power generation. They raise the scenic beauty of the 
city and are actively used for industry and irrigation. 
  Huichon also has famous mineral springs, including Kwandae, 
Myongdae, Chongnyang, and Chongsang Mineral Springs. 
  It belongs to the area with the warmest climate conditions 
in 
Chagang Province. 
  Given these natural, geographic conditions, it can be said 
that our home has conditions favorable for economic development. 
  However, in the past, Huichon was a backward, slash-and-burn 
agricultural zone, in which slash-and-burn fields were reclaimed 
and planted with millet, wheat, and potatoes. At that time, 
therefore, there were only a few blacksmith's shops and 
individual, manual breweries. 
  Thus, before liberation, would anyone have dreamt that our 
home would become a center of the machine-manufacturing 
industry, as it is today? Huichon was able to become a 
machine-manufacturing center, and the pride of the nation, as a 
result of the wise leadership of the Fatherly Leader and the 
Dear Leader. 
  Already foreseeing the victorious future amid the shellfire 
of the stern Fatherland Liberation War, the Great Leader 
revealed the shining path of chuche economic development for the 
long-term future of the fatherland. 
  Saying that if we are to build the nation's strong, chuche 
industry, we must first develop a machine-tool industry, which 
is central to the machine-manufacturing industry, the Great 
Leader personally chose the site of a machine-tool factory here 
in Huichon, with its close power-supply base and its convenient 
traffic situation, and solved all problems presented by factory 
construction. Thus, amid the flames of war a machine-tool 
factory suddenly stood strongly on Huichon land. 
  The great history of change began in Huichon at that time. 
  Thus, the glory of the "Mother Factory" shown in Huichon 
during the periods of postwar reconstruction and basic socialist 
construction, and the history of our nation's first machine-tool 
industry was created. In the early 1970s, lifting high the torch 
of the Three Technical Revolutions, the whole production process 
was reorganized into a great specialized system, capable of 
giving birth to the miracle of making 1,000 machine tools per 
month, or over 10,000 per year, if so desired by the Great 
Leader and the Dear Leader. 
  The Dear Leader took a hand, leading our city Huichon, so as 
to strengthen and develop it, making it our country's 
machine-industry city. 
  Visiting the factory on 26 February 1967, the Dear Leader 
showed workers his unlimited confidence and clearly revealed the 
road ahead for the factory. 
  The Dear Leader solved all our problems, great and small, so 
that Huichon will play an important part in the development of 
our nation's machine industry. 
  Huichon was able to change as it has today because of the 
wise leadership of the Great Leader and the Dear Leader. 
  This is so, even if we only look at a few of the facts. 
  Industry developed in Huichon. The machine industry makes up 
about 70 percent of its total industrial output. Of this, it 
makes up about 80 percent of central industries. 
  It is no accident, therefore, that our city is called a 
modern, machine-industry city. 
  Its site chosen personally by the Great Leader amid the 
flames of war and guided by him, Huichon Machine Tool Federated 
Industries [Huichon Kongjak Kigye Yonhap Kiopso] is widely known 
in our country as a base of machine-tool production. 
  Already lifting high the torch of the Three Technical 
Revolutions in the early 1970s leading the nation, this factory 
has brought truly spectacular development. 
  The corps of machines, linked, spread out along the 
automated 
line, is just like a machine sea. Regardless of whether one goes 
to the sites of the remotely controlled, cast-iron production 
process, the lathe-bead automated line, the apron-manufacturing 
automated line, the support [patchigae] assembly line, or the 
sites of casting, manufacturing, or assembly processes, all are 
modern. 
  Equipment, such as automated lines, programmed lathes, 
multipurpose milling machine, drill press, plaining machine, and 
so on, produced in the factory, and the newest machine tools are 
being sent to machine factories and the factories of various 
sectors of the people's economy all over the country. 
  Their quality high, products manufactured here are also 
meeting with foreign approval. Thus, they make up an important 
part in our country's machine-tool exports. 
  The factory is equipped with a research center and 
experimental laboratories fitted with the newest equipment in 
keeping with the demands of modern scientific and technological 
development. 
  Today, as the factory changes into a large-scale, 
machine-tool production base, it is developing into a more 
modern facility of a world-class scale. 
  No matter where one goes in Huichon, one hears the sonorous 
sounds of the working equipment of the machine corps, well known 
as our country's machine-industry city. 
  Together with industrial production, the appearance of the 
city has changed drastically. 
  Enter its streets, stores, or the homes of its workers and 
they are full of the sound of happy laughter. 
  The streets Namchon-kori and Chupyong-kori are formed 
following the banks of the Huichon River, with multi-floored 
houses lining up along it. Unable to even think of college 
during the Liberation War, the Huichon Industrial College, the 
Machine College, and technical schools have appeared in our city 
and are raising men talented in machine-industry technology. 
  Is that all? A modern cultural center, library, sports 
complex, department store, hospital, medical clinic, sanitarium, 
and recuperation center were created under the benevolent 
affection of the Dear Leader. 
  Also, what of the support facilities for the workers of 
Huichon? 
  There are vegetable gardens equipped with sprinkler 
irrigation equipment. There is a prairie-chicken factory 
producing several million chicken and quail eggs and large 
quantities of meat a year, a duck factory producing tens of 
thousands of duck eggs and over a thousand tons of meat, and 
even a deer ranch. 
  Although only wild pears were seen in the past, Huichon now 
has a fruit-production base, producing a great deal of all kinds 
of fruits, including pears, apples, peaches, and grapes. 
  It can truly be said that wherever one goes in today's 
Huichon, it is full of pride and overflowing with joy.

<F P=106> ["Article" by R.J. Strider and Pyone Cho] </F>
  [Text] The February issue of MYETKHIN THIT journal, 
published by the intelligence service of SLORC [State Law and 
Order Restoration Council], contains language detrimental to the 
prestige of Thai Crown Princess Mahachakri Sirinthon, and has 
caused embarrassment to the SLORC. 
  On page 135 of issue no. 46 is an article in the form of a 
dialogue between a Vietnamese national, Nguyen Nge and a Burmese 
national, Saw Indei. The dialogue contains terms insulting to 
Thai Princess Mahachakri Sirinthon, daughter of the Thai king. 
It makes references to Mahachakri Sirinthon being world-famous 
for being born as a daughter of the Thai king. It contains 
references saying that had she been born of a (?Burmese) 
peasant, Sirinthon may well have been a prostitute. 
  The same article says prostitution has become a traditional 
source of livelihood in Thailand and that Thailand is achieving 
a high standard of living through prostitution and that the 
revolutionary trait has disappeared. If such a rude reference 
had been made to the daughter of the Thai king in Thailand, 
there would certainly be charges of lese majeste and harsh 
punishment. 
  Such an article could not have been published without 
official authorization in Burma, where there are strict 
censorship rules and the Army strictly controls the publication 
of journals. MYETKHIN THIT has been published by the SLORC 
since 1990 and has been used to blatantly attack democratic 
forces inside and outside the country, political leaders, 
foreign countries, and Western diplomats. 
  Po Kan Kaung's article in the February issue of MYETKHIN 
THIT 
journal has surprised many Burmese observers because relations 
between Thailand and Burma have been good. Thailand, which has 
been enjoying special privileges in timber and fishery 
concessions, has been opposing international efforts to isolate 
the SLORC. Lately, the SLORC, which has been expanding economic 
relations with other countries, including Singapore, has accused 
Thai businessmen of illegal fishing and logging. 
  It is possible that the article, which contains crude 
language, may well reflect the SLORC government's displeasure 
with the Thais. The article also contains references that could 
damage the prestige of the Thai military. The article says that 
since the end of World War II, Thailand has been instrumental in 
spreading U.S. imperialism in Southeast Asia, and that the Thai 
Armed Forces have been under the patronage of the U.S. Army. 
While the Burmese and the Vietnamese Defense Services were 
discharging their national duty, the Thai Armed Forces lacked 
revolutionary characteristics. 
  Despite the allegations made by MYETKHIN THIT, there has 
been 
a surprising lack of reaction from the Thai Armed Forces and 
entrepreneurs. 
  According to one source, although Thai military intelligence 
obtained the article, they suppressed the report to prevent it 
from leaking to the Thai public. It can be seen that although 
the Burmese generals are insulting the prestige of Thailand, 
Thai military officials are remaining silent over the matter for 
their own self-interest.

  [Text] The Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting 
nations will this week consider whether to continue as an 
informal group or to establish a secretariat. 
  The group was set up in 1986 to lobby for farm trade 
liberalisation in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. 
  Cairns Group ministers agreed at the round's concluding 
meeting in Morocco last month that the group should remain in 
existence to monitor the implementation of the round's 
agreements on agriculture and to lobby for further 
liberalisation. 
  The discussions on the group's future structure will take 
place at the group's 14th ministerial meeting in Montevideo, 
Uruguay on May 19-20. 
  Thailand, which played a key role in setting up the group, 
still needs the group to push for more agricultural trade 
liberalisation under the new World Trade Organisation (WTO) 
scheduled to be established next year, Business Economics 
Department Director-General Kroekkrai Chiraphaet said on Friday. 
  He said the meeting would discuss its role and internal 
cooperation, especially on the task of monitoring whether 
signatories of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which 
would become members of the WTO, followed their commitment to 
open markets to farm products and reduce domestic and exports 
subsidies. 
  Thailand, as an active member of the Cairns Group, believed 
that even through the Uruguay Round included clauses on 
agricultural trade, more free trade was needed, he said. 
  Mr Kroekkrai said the group had to consider whether to opt 
for informal cooperation as existed or a formal office with a 
permanent secretariat. 
  The group also needed to talk about nominating a 
representative to chair the WTO's agriculture committee to be 
set up to supervise world farm trade. 
  In Marrakech last month, Australian Trade Minister Bob 
McMullan proposed that the group should try to have one of its 
members elected chairman of the agricultural committee. Thai 
Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said he thought 
Thailand could play that role. 
  Dr Suphachai will head the Thai delegation at this week's 
meeting in Uruguay. Mr Kroekkrai will be the leader at official 
level. 
  The Thai delegation will visit Washington before going to 
Uruguay. 
  Dr Suphachai will meet United States Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor to discuss Thailand's position on Washington's 
"Priority Watch List" of countries accused of failing to provide 
adequate protection for US intellectual property. 
  Dr Suphachai said even the US had recognised that Thailand 
had made progress in dealing with protection of intellectual 
property rights but Thailand wanted to explain to the US that 
the amendment of the Copyright Law depended on Parliament. 
  Both sides will discuss the agenda for their talks expected 
to be held in Washington next month. Thailand wants to talk 
about cooperation on economic issues, particularly joint 
investments in Thailand the third countries.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri informed reporters 
today that information provided by the United States regarding 
its case against MP Thanong Siriprichaphong to his ministry has 
been forwarded to the Interior Ministry. The relevant laws will 
have to be consulted on whether it is possible to extradite the 
MP for trial in the United States. 
  [Begin recording] [Prasong] There was a discussion this 
morning regarding the relevant laws. We will look into every 
angle. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What is the government's position? 
Will the MP be tried here or extradited to the United States? 
  [Prasong] If there is a law that allows an extradition, we 
will probably have to cooperate with the United States to 
preserve our country's reputation. If the law does not allow 
this, then we will not be able to extradite him. The legal 
specialists will consult the law in case the United States 
requests an extradition. 
  [Reporter] In most previous cases, the United States was 
able to bring major drug traffickers to trial in its courts. 
  [Prasong] Most of them were arrested in the United States or 
in third countries. 
  [Reporter] What if there are other officials involved in 
this case? 
  [Prasong] [Words indistinct]. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["REUTER/YONHAP report from Vienna"] </F>
  [Text] On 17 May one official at the North Korean Embassy 
in Vienna said that news reports that North Korea has already 
begun replacing fuel rods of the 5 megawatt nuclear reactor in 
Yongbyon are not true. 
  He said that news reports that used nuclear fuel rods have 
already been removed for installment of new ones are contrary to 
the truth. But, he hinted that preparatory work to replace 
nuclear fuel rods at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor may have begun 
by now. He added: "We do not know whether nuclear fuel rods are 
being replaced. But, it, if any, may be preparatory work. It 
takes two months to replace nuclear fuel rods." 
  In the meantime, the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] said that a team to inspect North Korea's nuclear 
facilities went to Yongbyon via Pyongyang on 18 May. 
  The inspection team will conduct inspections of the nuclear 
reprocessing facilities--whose inspections were held in check by 
the North Korean side last March--and will examine the 
surveillance camera installed at the nearby nuclear reactor. 
The IAEA side pointed out that such an examination alone can 
find out whether fuel rods at the nuclear reactor have been 
replaced or not.

  [Text] Washington, May 17 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
informed the United States that it will allow the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to check the fuel rods taken out of 
its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon later, an official at 
the North Korean mission to the United Nations said on Tuesday. 
  He said that although North Korea began to replace the fuel 
rods of the 5mw reactor in Yongbyon, it will seal the spent fuel 
and keep it under the IAEA's strict surveillance. 
  "We will then allow accurate measurement of the spent fuel 
when we and the United States comprehensively settle the nuclear 
problem in a package deal," he said. 
  The official reiterated the statement by a North Korean 
Foreign Ministry spokesman that Pyongyang had to begin replacing 
the fuel rods for reasons of technical safety. He also noted 
that the statement emphasized that the nuclear problem can still 
be solved through dialogue. 
  Thomas McLarty, chief of staff for U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, told a TV news program last weekend that Washington 
needs more information about North Korea's refueling and is 
waiting for reports from the IAEA team, which began its 
inspections on Tuesday. 
  The United States, however, may not have any alternative but 
to study ways at the U.N. Security Council to impose sanctions 
on North Korea if the IAEA inspection fails to come up with 
satisfactory results, diplomatic sources said.

  [Text] According to military sources, on 15 and 16 May the 
U.S. imperialists deployed for mobile operations long-range 
aircraft squadrons in South Korea, waging a provocative aerial 
war exercise aimed at a northward invasion. 
  On 15 May, deployed for mobile operations in the bases of 
the 
U.S. Air Force in South Korea were squadrons of nuclear-loaded 
F-16 and F-15 fighters-bombers, EA-20 observation aircraft flown 
in from U.S. Pacific bases. 
  On 16 May, in accordance with the operational plans of the 
U.S. Pacific Air Force Command, these military aircraft ran wild 
in staging an aerial war exercise--centered on the skies over 
Chungju, Yongwol, and (?Kunwi)--aimed at launching a surprise 
strike against the facilities of the strategic in-depth areas of 
the northern part of the Republic. 
  This war exercise was aimed at conducting a swift deployment 
of the overseas-based aircraft into the Korean Peninsula for 
mobile operations and at increasing the capabilities for an 
actual warfare between the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and the 
puppet air force for launching a joint strike for a northward 
invasion. 
  In the meanwhile, flown into the U.S. Air Force bases in 
South Korea on 15 May were a succession of squadrons of C-141 
and C-130 transport planes, including super-large C-5 transport 
aircraft, carrying numerous troops and lethal equipment from 
U.S. Pacific bases. 
  All facts show that the U.S. imperialists' maneuvers of 
preparing a war of aggression are reaching a grave stage.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- More than 50,000 members 
of dissident organisations and students held rallies and 
demonstrations demanding a probe into the truth behind the 
suppression of the Kwangju resistance and the punishment of 
those responsible for it in different parts of South Korea on 
May 17, one day before the 14th anniversary of the May 18 
Kwangju resistance, according to radio reports from Seoul. 
  The resistance was triggered off by the hysteric suppressive 
offensive launched by the U.S. imperialists and the "Yusin" 
remnants, their stooges, after expanding the scope of the 
"emergency martial law" to the whole area of South Korea in May 
1980. 
  In Seoul, the National Alliance for Democracy and 
Reunification held a people's rally in the Chongmyo Park and 
strongly demanded the clarification of the truth behind the 
Kwangju incident which is still kept behind a curtain and the 
punishment of those responsible for the suppression of the 
resistance. The rally was attended by over 2,000 people. 
  Many students of universities gathered in Yonsei University 
and held a rally before staging a demonstration, marching toward 
the houses of Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the principal criminals 
in the Kwangju massacre. 
  Upwards of 10,000 students of 44 universities and colleges 
turned out in the struggle in Seoul and other parts of South 
Korea. 
  Kwangju was wrapped in a memorial atmosphere. An evening 
memorial service for those who fell in the Kwangju resistance 
was held in Kwangju on the eve of the 14th anniversary of the 
May 18 resistance. 
  An estimated 10,000 citizens and students of Kwangju 
gathered 
in the plaza in front of the South Cholla "provincial 
government" and recalled the days of the resistance, singing the 
song of May. 
  A citizens' rally was held in Pusan for the clarification of 
the truth behind the repression of the Kwangju resistance with 
200 or more students and citizens in attendance.

  [Text] Foreign affairs officials have expressed concern 
over reports that police and naval officials from the People's 
Republic of China have been involved in half of nearly 100 cases 
of piracy in the South China Sea, an area where various states 
in the region, including the Philippines, have conflicting 
territorial claims. 
  Official reports reaching the Department of Foreign Affairs 
[DFA] disclosed information from the Hong Kong Government that 
47 out of 98 "attacks on shipping" during the past 18 months 
have been traced to Chinese officials. 
  The information was formally relayed by the Hong Kong Marine 
Department to Admiral Thimio Mitropoulos, chairman of the United 
Nations International Maritime Organization [IMO] Safety 
Committee. 
  The Hong Kong confidential papers pointing to China as being 
responsible for the attacks were compiled from distress messages 
picked up by Hong Kong's Rescue Coordination Center since 1992, 
the report to the DFA said. 
  "About 47 attacks have clearly pointed to Chinese officials' 
involvement, identifying police, customs, naval, and army 
officers, right down to serial numbers of patrol vessels," the 
report added. 
  Hong Kong had wanted to expose China's alleged involvement 
in 
piracy in the South China Sea to international attention during 
Mitropoulos' recent visit to the crown colony. 
  But the report noted that information on piracy cases 
involving China was deleted from an earlier report by Hong Kong 
to the Mitropoulos committee, with Hong Kong's foreign office 
and security branch intervening to ensure that the marine 
department did not mention any Chinese involvement. 
  Great Britain and its colony, Hong Kong, along with China, 
are members of the UN International Maritime Committee. 
  Foreign affairs officials, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said that countries with overlapping claims to the 
Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, have chosen "not to 
react" to the report, since this may be a source of instability 
in the region. 
  "The Philippine Government, on the other hand, would prefer 
to have more proof to determine whether the attacks were carried 
out by Chinese officials or by renegade Chinese," they said. 
  The sources noted that although the acts of piracy occurred 
outside the Philippines' sea-lanes in the South China Sea, 
China's illegal activities may "disturb the equilibrium" in the 
region. 
  They added, major shipping nations, such as Japan, Norway, 
Greece, and other countries in Europe, through big fleet owners, 
should take the initiative in asking the IMO to "take 
appropriate action" against China. 
  The Philippines, the sources admitted, lacks naval and air 
facilities to monitor piracy in its own waters, including the 
portion it is claiming in the South China Sea. 
  Besides triggering another wave of concern over regional 
stability, the piracy cases attributed by Hong Kong to China may 
further strain relations between them. 
  Hong Kong's governor, Christopher Patten, has proposed 
several constitutional revisions aimed at giving greater 
democracy to the crown colony it reverts to China in 1997. 
  Patten's proposals, which included giving voters the right 
to 
elect the majority of its legislators in 1995, have irked China. 
Hong Kong's expose on China's alleged piracy is the latest in 
the series of irritants between the colony and the mainland. 
  Earlier, China's insistence to push through with its joint 
oil exploration of a portion of the South China Sea with the 
cooperation of the U.S.-based Crestone Energy Corp. has renewed 
tensions in the region. 
  Vietnam had claimed that the area China wants to explore is 
part of its continental shelf. 
  Philippine officials have expressed concern over the brewing 
feud.

  The Kingdom of Cambodia and its unfortunate people are 
sinking deeper everyday into the abyss of national annihilation. 
In the face of so much misery befalling my motherland and to an

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
will probably defer a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton 
until he attends a summit of leaders of major industrialized 
nations in naples in early July, a government source said 
Wednesday. "Prime Minister Hata is unlikely to visit the United 
States prior to the summit meeting," the source said. 
  Tokyo and Washington are currently trying to arrange a 
meeting between the two leaders during the Group of Seven summit 
slated for July 8-10 in Naples, or at another location in 
Europe, the source said. 
  Japan, in bracing itself for the summit, has to work out 
specific proposals to alleviate the global unemployment problem, 
expand government investment, bolster the anemic economy, reform 
its taxation system and proceed with deregulation, he said. 
"Japan will make steadfast efforts to sketch out economic 
measures to bolster private consumption," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Tokyo will seek to find 
common ground with the United States, especially on the overall 
goal of the trade "framework" talks, during subcabinet-level 
negotiations to be held in Washington from Thursday, a senior 
Japanese Trade Ministry official said Tuesday. 
  Clarification of Japan's stance on the issue is one of three 
conditions presented by the U.S. in April for getting the 
stalled talks moving again. The other two are a pledge on 
macroeconomic policy measures and "objective criteria." 
  Washington has requested that Japan promise an increase in 
American access to Japan's markets on a sectoral basis, said the 
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
(MITI), who declined to be named. 
  The original framework accord signed after the July 1993 
summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton stated that the two countries would 
strive to enhance Japan's imports from the U.S. on an "overall 
basis." 
  Japan will carry an answer to the U.S. request for a 
statement on the overall goals of the framework talks during the 
coming Washington meeting, the MITI official said.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar TV Network in 
Japanese at 1100 GMT on 8 May, in its "Sunday Project" program, 
carries a 30-minute live roundtable discussion on Japan-U.S. 
ties and framework talks. The discussion is moderated by 
Soichiro Tahara. Guests include Kyoto University Professor 
Masaaki Kosaka; Hajime Takano, chief editor of INSIDER magazine; 
Kenichi Omae, head of Heisei Restoration Group (Heisei Ishin No 
Kai); Bill Totten, president of Assist Corporation; and 
Yoshihiro Tsurumi, New York City University professor. 
  The first 11 minutes of the discussion are devoted to former 
Justice Minister Nagano's remarks on the Nanjing massacre in 
China and Nagano's resignation. 
  At 1111 GMT, Tahara begins to review the series of events 
took place during the Hosokawa administration over the 
Japan-U.S. framework talks. Noting the recent report of the 
U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Tahara asks Omae if Japan-U.S. 
economic ties have reached the worst situation possible. Omae 
says that economic relations between the two countries are good, 
that most U.S. companies in Japan are doing well, and that the 
USTR, contrary to the true state of affairs, is creating a 
commotion. He continues to say that the USTR is a "tradesman" 
representing a very small number of U.S. companies having 
difficulties in Japan. He adds: "The policy of truly 
first-class companies is not to use the USTR." Tsurumi also 
says: "Japan-U.S. relations are not bad at all as far as the 
economy is concerned. It is true, however, that for political 
reasons, many people in Japan and the United States are stirring 
up the situation." Tsurumi then says that the Clinton 
administration is bashing Japan to avoid criticism by U.S. 
citizens directed at the U.S. Government and that "the $60 
billion trade deficit with Japan is a lie." Asked what he 
thinks of Omae's comments on the USTR, Totten says: "The USTR 
is accepting bribes in addition to using U.S. citizens' tax 
money. The money Motorola and other companies pay to the USTR 
is bribe money in terms of Japanese law. Americans calling it 
lobbying." Omae and Tsurumi urge Japanese politicians to 
realize the true intentions of the United States and not to 
respond to their unfair demands. 
  On resumption of Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
Tsurumi 
says: "There is no reason for Japan to resume the framework 
talks." He reiterates that Japan will gain nothing from 
resumption of the framework talks and states: "It is the 
Clinton administration which will be in trouble if the framework 
talks do not start again." 
  Citing the examples of U.S. discussions with China over 
human 
rights and Singapore's refusal of President Clinton's demand for 
Singapore not to cane an American youth, Omae says that the 
Japanese Government should resolutely refuse the USTR's recent 
three-point demand for resumption of the framework talks.

  [Excerpts] At the invitation of Comrade Lieutenant General 
Chi Haotian, PRC national defense minister, and Comrade Marshal 
O Chin-u, DPRK minister of the people's armed forces, a 
high-level military delegation of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic [LPDR] headed by Comrade Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason, 
paid visits to the two countries respectively beginning 5 May. 
  On 15 May, Comrade Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason and our 
high-level military delegation returned to Vientiane. [passage 
omitted] 
  During its 10-day official visits, the LPDR military 
delegation visited many production establishments and military 
garrisons. 
  During the visit to the PRC from 5 to 9 May, the comrade 
LPDR 
national defense minister and his entourage met with Comrade Lt. 
Gen. Chi Haotian, PRC national defense minister, and his party. 
They exchanged views and informed one another about certain 
issues of mutual interest. The two sides also discussed the 
further strengthening of solidarity, friendship, and relations 
between the Armed Forces of the two countries in the interests 
of the two peoples who have maintained traditional relations and 
solidarity since ancient times. The LPDR military delegation 
laid a wreath at the Mao Zedong mausoleum, visited the high 
technology development area of Chengdu in Sichuan Province -- 
PRC's fourth-ranked high technology development region. 
Everywhere the comrade LPDR national defense minister and the 
party went, they were warmly and respectably welcomed by 
officers and soldiers of the military installations concerned. 
The visit to the PRC by the high-ranking LPDR military 
delegation served to further strengthen the spirit of goodwill, 
friendship, and solidarity between the Lao and Chinese Armed 
Forces. 
  In the DPRK visit from 9 to 14 May, the high-level Lao 
military delegation headed by Comrade Lt. Gen. Choummali 
Sai-gnason met with the high-level DPRK military delegation 
headed by Vice Marshal (Che Kuang), chief of staff and acting 
minister of the people's armed forces of the DPRK. The two 
sides informed each other on issues of mutual interest on the 
basis of solidarity, friendship, and mutual understanding. The 
Lao military delegation also visited the Museum of Three 
Revolutionaries and the Museum of the National Liberation 
Struggle, laid a wreath at the Monument of Unknown Soldiers, a 
bouquet of flowers at the Monument of Victory, visited (Man 
Yongbo) village -- the birthplace of Comrade President Kim 
Il-song, great leader of the Korean people. They also attended 
an acrobatics show performed by the DPRK Armed Forces, visited 
the Pyongyang youth palace, toured the People's Great Library, 
and visited the chuche monument symbolizing the chuche policy 
outlined by President Kim Il-song, great leader of the Korean 
people, which has been applied by the Korean people in the 
building of the DPRK-style socialism. In addition, the 
delegation also visited a number of military installations. 
Everywhere Comrade Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason and the party 
visited, they were warmly and honorably welcomed by the hosts. 
  The first visit to the DPRK by the high-level Lao military 
delegation in the name of the Lao People's Army has enabled us 
to understand the reality of the all-around growth and strength 
of the DPRK built in accordance with the chuche policy outlined 
by the Korean people's Great Leader Comrade President Kim 
Il-song and Beloved Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. It also served 
to further strengthen the relations of friendship and solidarity 
between the Lao and Korean people's armed forces.

  [Excerpt] Vientiane, May 14 (KPL) -- [Passage omitted] Mr. 
Khamtai Siphandon's address at the inaugural session of the 
third congress of the LPRYU [Lao People's Revolutionary Youth 
Union] yesterday morning emphasized the youth organisation's new 
challenge in fulfilling the comprehensive policy of renovation 
of the party and state, in the safeguarding of the nation's 
independence and territorial integrity while improving the 
livelihood and the well-being of the people in the country. 
  The president of the LPRP CC [Lao People's Revolutionary 
Party Central Committee] said that the youth ought to have 
revolutionary ideals in life, and have the needs and energy to 
put into deeds their ideals for the benefits of the society. 
They ought to have knowledge, skills in addition to correct 
revolutionary moral and conducts in the execution of the public 
tasks in all sectors. The youths should be the leading task 
forces at all fronts including those involved in anticorruption, 
embezzlement, illegal transactions, tax collection, and other 
negative manifestations in the society. He said that the youth 
ought to translate their slogan "wherever there is difficulty, 
the youth will handle; wherever there is hardship, the youth 
will overcome; when the nation calls, the youth will be present" 
into deeds in their integrated endeavours for national 
construction from now till 2000. They must make optimal use of 
the natural resources of the country in a sustainable manner so 
that the people in the nation can benefit from the wealth of the 
nation, providing each and everyone clothes and food so that the 
people's living standard can be stabilised and improved. 
  Mr. Khamtai Siphandon said that the issue of expanding 
membership of the LPRYU was an important task that the Lao youth 
organisation needed to give special attention to and together 
with the party organisation this issue needed to be handled. On 
the one hand, the organisation of the youth needed to be 
streamlined for work efficiency, and along with this, there 
ought to be a programme for educating the organisation's members 
and non-members alike so that they would understand and 
appreciate the party and state's policies and the state's laws.

  [Text] Malacanang [presidential office] is open to the 
possibility of holding the second round of formal talks between 
the government and the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] in 
the Philippines, if Indonesia could no longer host the peace 
negotiations. However, Presidential Adviser on the Peace 
Process Manuel Yan said the Philippine Government will wait for 
Jakarta's advice on the date when it could be held. 
  The talks were scheduled to be held yesterday, however the 
Indonesian Government asked the Philippine Government panel to 
wait for further advice as to when the formal talks could be 
resumed in Jakarta. The Indonesian Government called off the 
second round of talks without giving any official excuse. 
Observers say however, Jakarta is angry because a Philippine 
nongovernment organization is hosting a conference on reported 
human rights violations in East Timor, a former Portuguese 
colony annexed by Indonesia in 1976.

  [Text] Felimon Lagman, chief of the Alex Boncayao Brigade, 
today challenged CPP-NPA-NDF [Communist Party of the 
Philippines- New People's Army-National Democratic Front] Chief 
Jose Maria Sison [Joma] to reveal the terms of the conflict if 
it does not want a peaceful breakup of their group. 
  In an interview with the Probe Team [GMA-7's weekly 
program], 
Lagman, alias Carlos Forte, said that the conditions of the 
conflict should be laid out. 
  [Begin Lagman recording] If he [Sison] truly rejects the 
peaceful disengagement, then we will be obliged to speak out. 
Let us define now the terms of engagement. If you [Sison] do 
not want a peaceful breakup, let us clarify the terms of 
engagement. 
  As what I have said, so that the military cannot sow bloody 
intrigues, let us clarify the target. If you want to target me, 
just say so publicly that it is Popoy [Lagman], and only Popoy. 
I will also declare openly that it is only him. So that if 
someone falls, it is the work of the military. [end recording] 
  In this regard, Lagman also said that the Ramos 
administration scored anew against Joma Sison through the 
government's release of Tiamzon. 
  [Begin Lagman recording] The Ramos regime really set up Joma 
for an intense wallop. The government will get the so-called 
high moral ground. If Joma continues his stubbornness, he will 
get an real intense wallop. 
  As we said, the movement has to pursue the peace discussion 
on substantial questions, not to argue on venue, and about 
whatever demands. The talks should be started. That is the 
solution. [end recording]

  [Text] President Fidel V. Ramos on Monday night invited 
communist party leader Wilma Austria-Tiamzon to help the 
government in its efforts to build lasting peace in the country 
by joining the peace process. The president personally conveyed 
this message to Tiamzon at the Philippine Heart Center in Quezon 
City, 11:30 PM. 
  Tiamzon who was captured by the Philippine National Police 
last 4 May was ordered transferred to the Heart Center by 
President Ramos last Thursday for humanitarian reasons. The 
Chief Executive went to the hospital to visit Environment and 
Natural Resources Secretary Angel Alcala who underwent a bypass 
operation last 10 May. He stayed at Secretary Alcala's room for 
15 minutes. 
  While in the hospital, President Ramos decided to drop by 
Tiamzon's room to inform her that he had earlier instructed 
Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon to order the provincial 
prosecutor in Quezon province to file the appropriate motion 
with the Regional Trial Court [RTC] there for her release. The 
president told Tiamzon and I quote, I have already instructed 
Secretary Drilon to order the provincial prosecutor in Quezon 
province to take the necessary steps so that you can be freed. 
Please, join the peace process, unquote. 
  Tiamzon is reportedly suffering from hypertension and 
asthma. 
Tiamzon is facing two cases of kidnapping and serious illegal 
detention before the RTC Lucena City. President Ramos explained 
to her that it will be the court that will order her release, 
adding that the government will not object to it, provided that 
she will be turned over to a responsible citizens' group. The 
president said Tiamzon and her lawyers will have to meet with 
Ambassador Howard Dee, chairman of the government panel for 
talks with the CPP-NPA-NDF [Communist Party of the 
Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front] to 
choose the organization that will take care of her. He also 
informed Tiamzon that the Catholic Bishops Conference of the 
Philippines and the National Council of Churches in the 
Philippines have expressed their willingness to take her into 
their custody. The president also clarified that since she is 
being released on recognizance, she will post no bail. Mr. Ramos 
pointed out and I quote, you can still stay here in the hospital 
after you are released to an institution that you have already 
been their responsibility, unquote. [sentence as heard] 
  On the appeal of Mrs. Tiamzon to dismiss all the charges 
against her, Secretary Drilon said the release on recognizance 
is only the first act. The dismissal of the case will have to 
be discussed. The president assured Tiamzon of due process in 
the disposition of her cases. The president talked with CPP 
leader for about five minutes.

  [Text] Mati, Davao Oriental -- President Ramos began his 
development blitz of southeastern Mindanao yesterday, putting in 
place an P870 million [Philippine pesos] network of 
infrastructure facilities to help propel the country's 
participation in the East ASEAN Growth Area or EAGA. 
  The president also urged the people of Mindanao to unite and 
work hard to help achieve the government's objective of 
transforming the country into a newly industrialized nation by 
year 2000. 
  "Let us do our jobs and create a momentum so that the 
younger 
Filipinos will have a better future and more prosperous life," 
the president said during a multi-sectoral meeting to launch 
projects and services for the region. 
  The infrastructure facilities include the P300 million 
Davao-Digos Road; the P400 million Digos-General Santos Road; 
the P11.7 million water impounding system for Digos; a P115 
million fund for the province for various development projects; 
and, a P44 million housing project for low-salaried government 
employees. 
  Ramos said the construction would be completed soonest, 
adding that funds had been made available so that builders could 
immediately start constructing the facilities. 
  Bidding for the projects will be finished in two months 
time, 
he said. 
  Ramos also released to the province P97 million representing 
its share of the internal revenue allotment for the first four 
months of the year. 
  He said the province's allotment for the rest of the year 
could be released on time by the budget department. 
  Aside from this, the president released P18.5 million 
representing funds for pet projects of lawmakers from the Davao 
provinces which are included in the budget law. 
  These projects include the construction of a tourism complex 
and the improvement of the police headquarters. 
  Other projects given funding commitments were: 
  -- Concreting of the Mati Coastal Road; 
  -- Rehabilitation of numerous farm-to-market roads; and, 
  -- Completion of the unfinished Tandag-Bislig Road in 
Surigao Del Sur. 
  The housing project, undertaken by the National Housing 
Authority will benefit some 116 homeless families. 
  The president said his administration was determined to 
improve the economy of southeastern Mindanao, seen as a major 
player in implementing the EAGA with provinces of Brunei, 
Indonesia, and Malaysia. 
  The general thrust is to make the country, through the 
economic development of sub-regions, more competitive in the 
global trade, tourism, and investment market, he said.

<F P=106> [By Maricris C. Carlos] </F>
  [Text] Despite present problems dogging the industry, the 
prospect of mining investments in the country remains the most 
lucrative in the world, contends Mining and Geosciences Bureau 
(MGB) Director Joel Muyco of the Department of Environment and 
Natural Resources (DENR). 
  Mr. Muyco cited as proof the country's overall per area 
mineral endowment, which places the Philippines second only to 
South Africa. The Philippines, he noted, has one of the highest 
mineral endowment ratio in the world. 
  The mineral endowment of a country serves as a measure of 
the 
extent of mineral distribution in a specific area. The ratio is 
computed by dividing the country's total land area with its 
confirmed mineral reserves. 
  According to DENR-MGB documents obtained by BUSINESS WORLD, 
in terms of gold deposits, South Africa has the richest reserves 
with a 15.80-ounce-per-square-kilometer mineral endowment ratio, 
while the Philippines is second with four ounces/square 
kilometer. 
  Papua New Guinea ranks third with 2.33 ounces/square 
kilometer. 
  Mr. Muyco told BUSINESS WORLD, if only these mineral 
reserves 
can be tapped, the mining industry will surely propel the 
Philippines to a newly industrialized status by the year 2000. 
  The reason the country has failed to truly industrialize is 
because government do not see the potential of the mining 
industry. 
  The mining sector is the key, he underscored. Unless 
government realizes this and put in place the needed programs 
and policies to relieve the pressure on the industry, the mining 
sector will remain an ailing industry. 
  At present, a bill reducing the excise tax on the industry 
is 
pending in Congress. 
  The existing 5 percent excise tax on the industry is 
considered as one of the biggest disincentives for investors. 
  The House of Representatives has already approved its 
version 
of the bill, which proposes to grant tax relief to the mining 
industry for an indefinite period or until the sector has 
recovered. 
  The Senate version of the bill, on the other hand, has just 
been recently approved on second reading. 
  According to the Senate bill, excise tax on metallic 
minerals 
should be slashed on the first three years from the present 5 
percent to just 2 percent for gold and 1 percent for copper; on 
the fourth and fifth years, gold will be taxed at 2-1/2 percent 
and copper at 1-1/2. On the sixth year, the 5 percent excise 
tax is restored for all metallic minerals. 
  The country's mining operations have been experiencing 
massive losses because of depressed metal prices and increasing 
production costs. 
  As a result, the sector's share of the country's export 
earnings had plunged, from 1973's 24.55 percent share to a 
dismal 6.38 percent in 1992. 
  The country's top mining companies include Atlas 
Consolidated 
Mining and Development Corp. (Cebu), Maricalum Mining Corp. 
(Negros Occidental), Marcopper Mining Corp. (Marinduque), Philex 
Mining Corp. (Benguet), Lepanto Consolidated Mining Corp. 
(Benguet), and Benguet Corp. (Dizon, Zambales).
