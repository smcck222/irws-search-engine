  [Text] Freed communist leader Wilma Tiamzon vowed 
yesterday to continue supporting the underground movement. 
Tiamzon was speaking during a news conference at the Philippine 
Heart Center where she is confined. Tiamzon was released to 
Bishop Alberto Ramento who represented the joint peace committee 
of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines and the 
National Council of Churches in the Philippines. Ramento said 
Tiamzon could go anywhere in the country and do whatever she 
wants to do. Ramento said that the custodianship is not 
physical but legal, adding that he could not ensure Tiamzon's 
security under his custody. He explained that it would not be 
his responsibility if Tiamzon decided to go underground again. 
At the news conference at the Philippine Heart Center, Tiamzon 
did not say if she would continue running the Communist Party of 
the Philippines.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 20 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The 
Malaysian Embassy in Phnom Penh was attacked early Thursday [19 
May] by unidentified persons who threw a grenade into the 
compound, an embassy official said. 
  The official said no one was hurt in the attack which 
occurred at about 1.30 am. 
  We don't know the identity of attackers or attacker nor the 
motive. But the police are investigating the incident, he told 
BERNAMA in a telephone interview. He said the explosion caused 
slight damage to the chancery building which is situated in the 
Cambodian capital's diplomatic quarter. 
  Security at the mission has been stepped up, he said. The 
mission has about 10 staffers, including the ambassador, but 
most are staying outside the embassy. 
  Such attacks were common during the UN-sponsored election 
period last year, but things has been quiet since in the city 
except for the normal criminal cases, a journalist for CAMBODIA 
TIMES Kim Seng said. 
  [Kuala Lumpur Voice of Malaysia in English at 0600 GMT on 20 
May in a similar report adds: "In Kuala Lumpur, Foreign Minister 
Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Malaysia was extremely 
disappointed over the attack. He expressed deep regret over the 
incident. He said [words indistinct]. However, he had directed 
that a report be compiled on the attack and hoped that it could 
be submitted to him soon."]

  [Text] The first joint army exercise between Singapore and 
the Philippines, a combined battalion live-firing exercise, 
ended yesterday with the successful capture of "enemy" 
objectives. 
  Singapore's Chief of Army, Brigadier-General [BG] Lim Neo 
Chian, and the Philippine Army's Commanding General, 
Major-General Romulo Yap, jointly officiated at the closing 
ceremony at the Safti [Singapore Armed Forces Training 
Institute] live-firing area, after witnessing the assault. 
  The live firing was the climax of the week-long combined 
land 
exercise involving the Singapore Armed Forces [SAF] and the 
Philippine Army, held under the Anoa-Singa series of exercises. 
  It was the first bilateral army exercise between the two 
countries to be held in Singapore. 
  Anoa-Singa 2/94 is conducted under a Memorandum of 
Understanding the two countries signed earlier this month. It 
provides for regular joint exercises between the two armed 
forces. 
  A 200-strong Philippine Army contingent took part in the 
exercise, with 600 SAF personnel from the 1st and 2nd 
Battalions, Singapore Guards. 
  Speaking at the closing ceremony, Maj. Gen. Yap said that 
the 
exercise had forged closer understanding and cooperation between 
the two armies. 
  He said that it had also provided the Philippine Army with 
its first opportunity to train with a "fellow Asian". 
  Its previous army exercises have been with only the United 
States. 
  Maj. Gen. Yap added that Singapore's Total Defence concept 
was useful to note at a time when the Philippine Army was itself 
strengthening its reserve force. 
  On the Singapore end, BG Lim said that the SAF troops found 
the lectures given by their Filipino counterparts on 
psychological operations beneficial. 
  Major James Lim, the Commanding Officer of 2nd Guards, said 
that the exercise gave the troops the chance to familiarise 
themselves with each other's doctrines and operating procedures. 
  He said the live-firing exercise was a display of mutual 
trust and respect for the skills of the soldiers of both armies. 
  The exercise, a battalion attack mission, went smoothly, 
although the soldiers carried it out with men whom they were not 
thoroughly familiar with, he added. 
  He said: "The element of trust comes in because live rounds 
are being used. The exercise requires the soldiers to depend on 
others who give support fire with artillery and tanks. 
  "Doing it with your own men requires trust, what more, doing 
it with soldiers from another army whom you don't know as well." 
  Maj. Lim said that the battalion live firing was also a show 
of respect by the soldiers for their counterparts' 
professionalism and skill. 
  Soldiers going into a live-firing exercise must have a high 
level of individual skill before they take part. 
  He said: "Obviously, the soldiers saw for themselves how 
proficient the Filipinos were. 
  "I think they felt the same way about our SAF soldiers too, 
after interacting with us." 
  The most important outcome, Maj. Lim said, was that after 
practising and going through the live firing together, the men 
have come out better friends. 
  The next bilateral exercise between the two armies is 
scheduled to be held next year in the Philippines, at the Fort 
Magsaysay training area.

  [Text] HANOI, May 20 (AFP) -- Vietnam is building a second 
lighthouse in the hotly-contested Spratlys archipelago in the 
South China Sea, the communist party's NHAN DAN newspaper said 
Friday. 
  The lighthouse going up on Da Tay island, 450 kilometers 
(280 
miles) from the Vietnam coast, will stand 20 meters (65 feet) 
high and cover an area of 25 kilometers (15 miles), the daily 
said. It illustrated its report with a photograph of Vietnamese 
workers at the site with incoming construction materials. 
  Vietnam built its first lighthouse in the Spratlys last 
October on Son Tu Tay island, in the northeast part of the 
far-flung archipelago, about 560 kilometers (350 miles) from the 
mainland naval base of Cam Ranh Bay. Standing 36 meters (120 
feet) high, it was fitted with radar. 
  Sovereignty over the Spratlys, which lie along strategic sea 
lanes and are supposedly rich in oil deposits, is disputed 
chiefly by China and Vietnam, with Brunei, Malaysia, the 
Philippines and Taiwan also making claims. 
  In charge of building the second lighthouse, requiring 6,500 
tonnes of material, is a company belonging to the Vietnamese 
government's civilian maritime affairs department. Work began 
last August, and is scheduled to be finished by the end of the 
year, an official of the department told AFP in Hanoi.

  [Text] During his current visit to Singapore, Vietnamese 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet addressed the Asia Society 
conference. The theme of the conference was Waves of the 
Future: ASEAN, Vietnam, China and Opportunities for World Trade. 
Following are excerpts of the prime minister's speech. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: If the waves of the past in 
the Pacific were in a hot-war-and-cold-war situation, today, 
waves were in calmer waters with a trend of cooperation having a 
chance to develop. ASEAN, China, and Vietnam were places where 
there are new opportunities for businesses. Now it was 
beneficial to turn the trend toward cooperation under a formal 
basis whose mainstay was mutual respect and cooperation of 
mutual benefit. 
  The Vietnamese prime minister said that when implementing 
its 
policy, Vietnam took into account the new trend. The danger was 
to lag behind in economic development compared to many countries 
in the world, including many countries in the region, if Vietnam 
was not fully well aware of this and did not strive harder. Mr. 
Vo Van Kiet said: By adopting the policy of comprehensive 
renovation in time, Vietnam had overcome its most crucial moment 
and could now work out for itself the way to step by step 
industrialize and modernize itself in the building of a 
prosperous and powerful Vietnam with an equal and civilized 
society. However, while the Vietnamese understood that domestic 
resources were the decisive factor, those resources would 
multiply if integrated into global development trends. Vietnam 
was an inseparable part of the world. It wished and must take 
part in the trend of international cooperation. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet stressed that the necessity for 
development in the region and the world was to enter into a new 
wave of peace and stability. He said the Asia-Pacific was a 
region of dynamic development. Trends for peace, stability, and 
cooperation were prevailing. However, he said, there might be 
some hidden factors which cause instability in the region. 
These were disputes over territory and territorial waters and 
tension in the Korean peninsula and in Cambodia, which were 
worrying to all. 
  He called for the settlement of existing disputes and 
differences between nations through peaceful negotiations on the 
basis of respect for international laws and in accordance with 
the common trend against the use of force in international 
relations and a recurrence of the cold war. 
  Once again, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet affirmed Vietnam's 
foreign policy to befriend all countries in the world and strive 
for peace, independence, and development. He said Vietnam 
attached great importance to friendship and cooperation with 
neighboring countries and the Asia-Pacific region. He once 
again welcomed the U.S. President's decision to lift the embargo 
on Vietnam, which opened up new possibilities for normalization 
of relations between the two countries. He said the Vietnamese 
Government and people welcomed and created favorable conditions 
for foreign investors to come to Vietnam.

  [Text] Implementing the Prime Minister's directive, the 
Ministry of Interior instructed police in localities to conduct 
a survey on the number of cars imported illegally into the 
country, including those imported without complying with the set 
procedures. 
  According to a recent survey, 28 provinces and 
municipalities 
have imported 1,512 cars of various types without meeting the 
set procedure requirements, mostly in Song Be, Tay Ninh, Dong 
Nai, Vinh Long, Dong Thap, Binh Thuan, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, 
Long An, Lam Dong, and Ninh Thuan Provinces. 
  Quang Ninh and Gia Lai Provinces reported that they did not 
register any new cars. A recent investigation found, however, 
that Quang Ninh Province registered four cars with fake customs 
clearance documents while the Pleiku City police of Gia Lai 
Province coordinated with the Quang Ngai provincial police to 
register 180 cars and motorcycles using fake customs documents.

exploit various new oil wells and develop old ones to increase 
crude oil production. As of 15 May, the enterprise had produced 
more than 2.5 million tonnes of crude oil. It has also 
exploited the acid substances produced at the bottom of oil 
wells and has signed contracts to improve conditions at various 
oil wells to increase the production output by 8,000 tonnes per 
day. While making great efforts to improve conditions at new

<F P=106> [By Robert Templer] </F>
  [Text] HANOI, May 20 (AFP) -- The leader of a dissident 
Vietnamese Buddhist church has appealed for his followers to 
step up their fight against what he termed Hanoi's repression of 
religion, according to a statement seen here Friday. 
  In a message to mark Buddha's birthday, the Venerable Thich 
Huyen Quang called on his followers to multiply "their efforts 
in the struggle for religious freedom and human rights," said a 
statement from the Paris-based International Buddhist 
Information Bureau. 
  The appeal, sent clandestinely from central Vietnam, where 
Quang is reportedly under house arrest, comes just days before 
the first anniversary of clashes between Buddhists and police in 
the central city of Hue after which three monks were sentenced 
to prison terms for "disturbing public order." 
  Quang has not been recognised as head of the Unified 
Buddhist 
Church of Vietnam (UBVC), and is under house arrest, according 
to Human Rights Watch/Asia. The government has denied the 
charge. 
  The Buddhist leader appealed for the stepped up campaign for 
the church's independence to be carried out "in the spirit of 
conciliation and non-violence." 
  He dismissed attempts by Hanoi to present a more tolerant 
face towards religion by allowing the restoration of pagodas and 
the opening of some Buddhist schools. 
  "This does not signify that we have religious freedom," 
Quang 
said. "A concrete proof of this is the fact that the authorities 
... continue to ban the UBCV and prohibit all its religious 
activities." 
  In the face of demands for greater religious freedom, "the 
authorities have stepped up their repression of the UBCV, 
harassing and imprisoning Buddhist dignitaries and followers," 
Quang said. 
  Hanoi denies oppressing Buddhism, pointing to the renovation 
of nearly all the country's more than 4,000 pagodas in the past 
three years and the increase in the number of monks and nuns 
from 17,000 to more than 20,000. 
  But to keep control over religion and a lid on potential 
dissent, Hanoi insists that all churches belong to the 
Fatherland Front, a communist party umbrella group for social 
organisations. 
  The UBCV has resisted attempts to force it to join the 
group, 
which it says attempts to control all religious activities, 
including the appointment of Buddhist leaders. 
  The church, which claims to be Vietnam's sole legitimate 
Buddhist church and traces its tradition back 2,000 years, has a 
history of resisting state control -- most famously during the 
rule of South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem. 
  Around 70 percent of Vietnam's 70 million people are 
Buddhists, with large numbers concentrated in the former 
imperial capital of Hue, where protests last year aroused 
intense anxiety in the government. 
  On May 24 last year, a group of Buddhist monks blocked 
traffic for hours in Hue with a sit-down protest after Tich Tri 
Tuu, the head of Linh Mu Pagoda, was taken away by municipal 
authorities to discuss the self-immolation of a man at the 
pagoda three days earlier. 
  Fearing Tich Tri Tuu was being taken to jail, protestors 
attacked, overturned and burned a police vehicle that 
authorities say was returning the monk to his pagoda after 
discussion of the incident. 
  Earlier this week, a Foreign Ministry spokesman denied a 
report from the Buddhist Information Bureau that the imprisoned 
monks were on hunger strike at the Ba Sao reeducation camp south 
of Hanoi. 
  But the government did not respond to an appeal by the group 
to allow representatives of the United Nations and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross to visit the monks.

  [Text] The government held its regular monthly meeting on 
18-19 May to discuss reports on its socioeconomic performance in 
the first six months, to outline measures to execute its work in 
the last six months to present to the fifth session of the Ninth 
National Assembly, and to decide on other important issues. 
Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai chaired the meeting. 
  Tran Xuan Ta, vice chairman of the State Planning Commission 
[SPC], on behalf of the SPC chairman, presented a report on the 
execution of socioeconomic planning in the first six months. 
Finance Minister Ho Te read a report on the implementation of 
the state budget in the first six months. Foreign Minister 
Nguyen Manh Cam reported on diplomatic activities in the recent 
months. 
  Cabinet members discussed and agreed on the government 
report, which is going to be presented to the National Assembly 
in the upcoming session. The minister in charge of the 
Government Organization and Personnel Commission [GOPC] also 
reported planning for training and restraining of management 
cadres and government officials. The cabinet agreed to charge 
the GOPC and other responsible organs to perfect further the 
planning before resubmitting it to the government in the coming 
period. The meeting also offered views and passed a regulation 
for the protection of consumers's rights and a regulation on 
authors' copyright protection, which are going to be submitted 
to the National Assembly Standing Committee in its upcoming 
meeting. 
  Speaking at the concluding session of the meeting, Deputy 
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai reminded cabinet members that 
despite the fact that our socioeconomic situation has improved 
continuously and has stabilized in all fields since the 
beginning of this year, many problems relating to the 
government's direct leadership and management have emerged. 
That requires government leadership and management which must 
be responsive and appropriate so national development can be 
further improved in the coming months. The deputy prime 
minister also stressed some measures to continue price 
stabilization, to control inflation, to increase budget revenue, 
to fight waste, to practice thrift, to ensure less spending from 
5 to 7 percent as outlined in the National Assembly Resolution, 
and to guarantee that the production development rate will reach 
the initial planning target in order to maintain the stable 
development rate for the entire year of 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Le Kha Phieu: "Develop the Dien Bien Phu Spirit </F>
in Carrying Out the Renovation Undertaking"] 
  [Text] The Dien Bien Phu victory is the resounding victory 
of the Vietnamese nation in its struggle against colonialism for 
national independence and freedom in the 20th century. Although 
40 years have elapsed, the significance of this historic victory 
is still fresh in the memory of all people. In the past, we 
have had ample time to review more profoundly and 
comprehensively the experiences and lessons drawn from the Dien 
Bien Phu battle so as to apply them to the national construction 
and defense tasks. Beyond the military aspect, the Dien Bien 
Phu victory also provides us with valuable lessons that can be 
applied not only to the military and national defense fields, 
but to the political, socioeconomic, cultural, and diplomatic 
domains. 
  It can be said that the Dien Bien Phu victory is not only of 
great significance to the Vietnamese people, but also plays an 
important role in encouraging the struggles of other nations. 
During the past 40 years, the mention of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, 
and Dien Bien Phu, as described by our friends,"has aroused the 
determination of billions of people struggling for national 
independence and freedom," and "has served as a martial song" 
for oppressed nations and other movements for national 
liberation. It also serves as "a reminding event" or "a great, 
significant truth that provides exalted hope for people 
struggling for their just cause." It can be said that although 
Dien Bien Phu is in a remote, rugged valley in the northwestern 
region of Vietnam, it has provided marvelous illumination for 
all. We, especially those who participated in the battle, have 
been astonished about its influence. Indeed, we are very proud 
to say that Dien Bien Phu is not only a valuable spiritual 
heritage of the Vietnamese people, but also the heritage of 
mankind. It is the duty of our generation to strive to protect 
this heritage while doing our best to bring the spirit of Dien 
Bien Phu into full play, especially in the national construction 
and defense tasks at present and in the days ahead. 
  Dien Bien Phu has symbolized our nation's earnest aspiration 
for national independence and freedom. The greatest truth of 
the Dien Bien Phu victory rests with the fact that a nation, 
although small and weak, can defeat whatever cruel imperialism 
and regain its independence and freedom if it knows how to unite 
its people to fight in true revolutionary spirit and in 
accordance with the correct orientation of the party and the 
proletariat. This has also proved as correct the brilliant 
truth that love and righteousness always wins over violence and 
tyranny. To realize this truth, several generations of our 
people have sacrificed untold blood and bone. President Ho Chi 
Minh condensed the definition of this truth into a phrase 
depicting our people's strong determination for their goal: 
"There is nothing more precious than national independence and 
freedom." From Dien Bien Phu to the protracted, heroic struggle 
against the U.S. imperialism, our people have fought in this 
spirit and impetus, and we have overcome all difficulties and 
ordeals to gain the final victory. During the more than 20 
years of carrying out our national liberation struggle since 
1954 and the subsequent period in the war for national 
salvation, we have never forgotten Dien Bien Phu. On the 
contrary, the spirit of Dien Bien Phu has been brought into full 
play, especially during the war of resistance for national 
salvation. At the most difficult conditions and decisive 
moments, the spirit of Dien Bien Phu has always served as an 
effective catalyst to encourage us to continue our struggle. 
Indeed, following the battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, we won a 
similar battle in the air in December 1972. The name of Dien 
Bien Phu has manifested the unyielding nature of the Vietnamese 
people. No force, regardless of how cruel it is and how much 
sophisticated equipment it is armed with, can conquer the united 
and well- organized people who rise up to defend their rights to 
live in independence and freedom. 
  Forty years after Dien Bien Phu, our nation has gained total 
independence and freedom. The nation has been unified and our 
people are living in peace. They are striving to build and 
defend the country while doing their best to attain the goal of 
making our people prosperous, our country powerful, and our 
society just and civilized. In the process of building and 
developing the country, the spirit of Dien Bien Phu has always 
stayed in the memory of the Vietnamese people because national 
independence is still the vital issue of the nation. Only when 
national independence is firmly protected and maintained can our 
nation develop and advance further toward socialism. Forty-five 
years ago, through the August Revolution, our people smashed the 
yoke of slavery and regained our independence and freedom. We 
are now determined to protect our rights to live and enjoy 
independence, freedom, and happiness. The fact that our nation 
has set two strategic tasks of building and defending the 
fatherland is aimed at leading our nation to stability and 
development, gradually overcoming the socioeconomic crisis, and 
making preparations to enter the new developmental stage to 
attain national industrialization and modernization. 
  What have we leant from the Dien Bien Phu Victory? That 
question is asked today and it will be asked again by our 
descendants in the future because the vitality of the Dien Bien 
Phu spirit started from our national tradition of thousands of 
years of fighting and that tradition has been impregnated in all 
our generations. Each generation will find its most valuable 
and suitable ways to transform the Dien Bien Phu spirit to 
revolutionary actions to solve its own practical problems. 
  The Dien Bien Phu Victory, first of all, is the strength of 
the determined-to-fight and determined-to-win spirit of our 
entire people for the noble goal of independence, freedom, and 
socialism. From December 1946, in response to President Ho Chi 
Minh's appeal, our entire army and people entered a long and 
arduous resistance war with the determination to "sacrifice 
everything and resolutely not to accept the loss of our country 
and become slaves" and to "gain independence even all Truong Son 
Range will be burnt out". They, with a iron belief in the last 
victory, accepted all hardship and sacrifice to resolutely fight 
and win in Dien Bien Phu. 
  In fighting as well as in peaceful construction, a 
determined 
willpower is a driving force of uttermost importance. It also 
is one of factors to decide victory. We do not believe in 
voluntarism. But we are easy to fail, even a small task, if we 
do not carry out a work with determination. At present, every 
Vietnamese and the entire people must carry a high determination 
to win over poverty and backwardness and to take our country 
forward. At the same time, we must also have a strong 
determination to resolutely and firmly protect our national 
independence and territorial integrity in any circumstances. We 
do not give in to slavery, starvation, and poverty. We have 
determination and belief -- the belief in the party's line and 
leadership, in the Vietnamese people's intelligence, and in the 
strength of the great national unity. Now, despite Vietnam is 
still a developing country, thanks to its insistence in the 
renovation and the great efforts from our party and people, we 
have overcome the socioeconomic crisis in one step. Our economy 
starts to accumulate some internal savings and people's life has 
been improved. Together with the socioeconomic progress, we 
have maintained political stability and strengthened security 
and national defense. Vietnam's position in the international 
arena has been heightened. Lessons drawn from the reality of 
the renovation are the new development of the former Dien Bien 
Phu lessons. These lessons are the lessons about the 
determination in the goal, the insistence in revolutionary 
principles and strategy, the resolution to overcome 
difficulties, and the active creativeness to discover and solve 
on-going problems. The difficulties in Dien Bien Phu 
battlefield were very grave. They affected the thinking of our 
cadres, soldiers, and people. But thanks to our high willpower 
and determination, we overcame all those difficulties and 
challenges to gain victory. The same thing has happened to our 
current undertaking of national construction and army building. 
At every stage, new requirements and difficulties do occur, but 
if we are firm, resolute in our goals, and determined to fight, 
we will overcome all difficulties to accomplish our duty. 
  Dien Bien Phu is a brilliant lesson on the spirit of 
self-reliance. In an unbalanced situation of armed forces, 
means, and technical equipment, our army and people developed 
their activism and creativeness to an highest level to 
satisfactorily prepare for the campaign, including political and 
ideological preparation and preparations for the Army, 
logistics, technology, fighting planning, fighting tactics,... 
to continuously impose sudden and unexpected things on our 
opponent. Before every new stage of the campaign and every wave 
of attacks, so many complicated issues emerged. But we 
developed the collective intelligence to find suitable measures 
for those problems. Therefore, despite of numerous difficulties 
in unbalanced strength and military equipment, our army and 
people heightened the spirits of determined-to-fight and 
determined-to-win, self-reliance, and courageous sacrifice to 
invent many unique, intelligent, and sufficient fighting tactics 
to take our enemy by surprise and frustrate their 
counterattacks. It is possible to say that in the Dien Bien Phu 
Victory, we knew how to develop the precious ethics and quality 
of the Vietnamese people to improve our internal strength to 
fight and to win. 
  Today, the lesson on the spirit of self-reliance is still 
carrying its full value. With our party and state's correct 
policy on foreign affairs, we have more and more friends in the 
world, thus creating new advantages for our national 
construction and development. But we have always confirmed that 
in national development, we would mainly rely on our internal 
force. 
  If we rely on foreign countries, we will have to depend on 
them. Let us uphold the spirit of independence and sovereignty, 
grasp all advantages and new opportunities to cooperate with the 
outside world and gain its support, and combine these factors 
with the abundant source of strength at home to create a new 
impetus for development. Along with upholding the spirit of 
self-sufficiency and self-help, let us practice thrift, promote 
a vigorous movement against corruption and waste, make the 
optimum use of capital and other resources, and concentrate 
efforts on boosting production and generating goods for society. 
The current army-building task must also be based on the spirit 
of self-sufficiency and self-help. Let us make the best use of 
all local and national potential and strive to practice thrift. 
No country can achieve its development goals without practicing 
thrift. If they want to enrich themselves and achieve their 
development goals, each country, each establishment, each 
family, and each person must save money. 
  Speaking of the Dien Bien Phu spirit, one must also deal 
with 
the most basic lesson about the leadership and direction of 
party organizations and party members and the need to constantly 
strengthen leadership skills. Based on their correct assessment 
of the situation, scientific analysis of real-life situations, 
and timely review of the experiences drawn from each phase of 
the campaign, each offensive, and each battle, our party and 
Uncle Ho -- the beloved father of our Armed Forces -- made 
correct decisions, thus reflecting their sensitivity, wisdom, 
and solid knowledge. Based on the actual situations and by 
weighing the pros and cons of whether one should launch swift 
attacks to annihilate the enemy or just attack small objectives 
to be sure of victory, we made an objective and scientific 
analysis and opted for the second solution, thus successfully 
overcoming the tendency to achieve our goals overnight and 
creating conditions for victory. Through the wars of resistance 
and then the process of postwar national construction, our party 
has drawn more leadership experiences to benefit the revolution. 
Faced with new problems arising from real life situations, one 
must always make a very objective, correct, and timely 
evaluation to rectify shortcomings and develop strong points. 
This will guarantee that whatever the circumstances, the people 
still believe in the leadership and direction of the party and 
state. Once they are motivated by high resolve and belief, the 
people will unanimously concur with major party and state 
policies and measures and will turn them into revolutionary 
determination and deeds. 
  Our party directed the Bien Bien Phu campaign not only 
through guidelines and decisions that were cautious yet bold and 
clear-sighted, but also through the good examples and vanguard 
role of each party member. There were instances when the 
situation developed complicatedly and gave rise to pessimism, 
vacillation, haste, or worse still, negativism and low combat 
morale. Primary party organizations launched a movement to 
conduct straightforward criticism and self-criticism among party 
cadres and party members and henceforth, generated strength and 
confidence in the masses. Party members set good examples 
through their words and deeds and faced difficulties, hardships, 
and sacrifices. The good examples of party members had great 
power of persuasion. This constituted a very desisive factor of 
command and leadership success and of willingness to make 
self-imposed sacrifices among cadres, combatants, and the entire 
people. This lesson is still valuable today. The party wants 
to make its leadership role felt in society and earn strength 
and credibility in the population. Therefore, each party member 
must set good examples for the masses to follow. No elaborate 
and empty terms can help the party earn strength and 
credibility. In the wars of resistance, party members were 
willing to make sacrifices. Therefore, in the postwar era, they 
should also be willing to endure hardships, make sacrifices, 
look after the people's well-being first, and see to it that 
their words and deeds help enhance the party's image among the 
people. 
  It also needs to recall another lesson about Dien Bien Phu, 
as this may help inspire new creative impressions among us in a 
way suitable to the current circumstances. That lesson is about 
mustering and gathering the strength and wisdom of all the 
people. One of the important reasons for the the Dien Bien Phu 
victory was that our party and state had effectively mustered 
and exploited the combined strength of the entire nation in the 
spirit: All for the Frontline, All for The Dien Bien Phu 
Campaign, The Entire Country Is To Be Oriented Toward Dien Bien 
Phu, and All Battlefields Are To Be Coordinated With Dien Bien 
Phu. At decisive points, we knew how to direct the manpower and 
property of the entire nation, of various localities, and of 
various battlefields at resolutely achieving our target of 
destroying the Dien Bien Phu stronghold. Today, in the 
renovation process, our course of action and goal are clear. We 
have determined our course of action suitable for each 
particular period of time. It is important that that we must 
develop to the fullest the latent potential in manpower and 
wisdom of the entire country, and of every locality, people, and 
household to unfailingly achieve the goal of building a 
prosperous people, a powerful country, and an equitable and 
civilized society. We have created conditions and premises to 
advance the country to a new stage of development, but whether 
we can translate our goal into reality will depend on efforts 
and energy of every locality, of every echelon, of every sector, 
and of everyone under the party leadership and the state 
management. 
  The mid-term national party conference held in January 1994 
analyzed the national situation, pointed out new opportunities 
and challenges our our country is encountering during the period 
of renovation. In this juncture, we must study various lessons 
of experience about Dien Bien Phu. These lessons are, in fact, 
about exploiting to the fullest all the advantages of the new 
situation so as to overcome difficulties and ordeals in 
achieving our final victory. As for ordeals, all shorts of 
seemingly unsurmountable ordeals and difficulties can be found 
from the Dien Bien Phu lesson. Having been able to overcome 
difficulties and exploit accurately and effectively all the 
opportunities in each stage and each battle as well as in the 
entire Dien Bien Phu campaign, the Vietnamese people have 
demonstrated their military arts, willpower, and talent. In the 
current renovation process, to overcome all challenges and to 
seize opportunities to move forward in national construction and 
defense, we must develop the willpower, talent, and efforts of 
the entire people. 
  The Dien Bien Phu event was just part of the tradition of 
national construction and defense built up by our forefathers 
since time immemorial. The Dien Bien Phu tradition is of 
unmeasurable spiritual value. It must be preserved and passed on 
from one generation to another. As this tradition is not a 
object to be kept in a museum, it must be developed into 
vitality and a determination to surge forward. In every stage 
of history, we must view the significance of the Dien Bien Phu 
victory with new thinking and new revelations. In whatever 
situation, be it advantageous or difficult, we can always find 
from the Dien Bien Phu victory the most beautiful spiritual 
value: The determination to fight and to win of our nation, and 
the desire of the entire Vietnamese people to gain independence, 
freedom, and happiness. With our intelligence and energy, with 
our talents and creativity, we are totally able to transform 
that desire into reality. 
  With such thinking, the memory of Dien Bien Phu will live 
forever and the Dien Bien Phu spirit will, at any moment and in 
any stage, be permeated with vitality. Dien Bien Phu will 
forever be a source of confidence and pride of our nation!

<F P=106> ["Full Text" of interview with Kim Il-song by the president </F>
of Cuba's PRENSA LATINA on 13 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has answered 
questions raised by the president of Cuba's PRENSA LATINA on 13 
April 1994. The full text of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song's answers were carried by the Cuban publication. The 
full text of his answers reads as follows: 
  [Kim Il-song] I appreciate your congratulations on my 
birthday and welcome your visit to our country. Hoping you will 
achieve a new success in your just communication and information 
business, I will answer your questions. 
  [PRENSA LATINA] The United States and the South Korean 
authorities are straining the situation by insisting that the 
DPRK has nuclear facilities to produce nuclear weapons. What is 
your country's position regarding this? 
  [Kim] We built nuclear facilities with our own strength and 
technology to further strengthen the country's energy base. Our 
nuclear activities are every inch peaceful. We have reiterated 
on many occasions that we have neither the will nor the ability 
to develop nuclear weapons. We do not need to develop nuclear 
weapons and, even if we make one or two nuclear weapons, they 
are of no use [solsa handugaeui haengmugirul mandundaeya kugosun 
amu soyongdo opsumnida]. The Government of our Republic has 
invariably made efforts to realize the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula originated from 
the 
United States' bringing of nuclear weapons into South Korea. 
The United States occupied South Korea, a strategic point, and 
brought large-scale nuclear weapons into South Korea to realize 
its aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy opposing our Republic. 
  Under the condition created in recent years, in which the 
Cold War ended internationally and North and South Korea adopted 
an agreement on nonaggression and the Joint Declaration on the 
Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the United States has 
lost the justification for retaining nuclear weapons and its 
aggression army in South Korea. Since then, the United States 
has tried to find a ruse to keep occupying South Korea and has 
deliberately strained the situation on the Korean peninsula by 
crying over the fictitious nuclear suspicion on us aimed at 
crushing [apsal] our Republic. 
  The South Korean authorities are also frenzied in the new 
war 
provocation maneuver, following the U.S. nuclear commotion. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved 
through dialogue between us and the United States since it 
originated in the hostile U.S. policy against Korea. The United 
States also recognized [injong] that the nuclear problem on the 
Korean peninsula should be settled by the DPRK and the United 
States, and acceded to DPRK-U.S. talks last year. 
  The joint statement that the DPRK and the United States 
announced at the talks after reaching an agreement clearly 
stipulates that the United States should not pose nuclear 
threats against us, that both countries should respect each 
other's sovereignty and should not interfere in domestic 
affairs, and that they support the peaceful reunification of 
Korea. The United States, however, is persistently adhering to 
the anti-Republic maneuver even after the announcement of the 
DPRK-U.S. joint statement. 
  The United States has driven the situation of our country to 
an extreme one [kuktanuro moragago issumyo] by overturning the 
agreement with us and rupturing DPRK-U.S. talks, and is 
maneuvering to pressure us by even mobilizing international 
organizations. Pressure cannot be a method to resolve the issue. 
  If one thinks that one can bring our people, who regard 
sovereignty as their life, to one's knee with pressure and 
strong-arm tactics, it is a miscalculation. 
  If the United States continues adhering to commotions of 
pressure against our Republic, we cannot but take due defensive 
steps in order to defend the nation's dignity and sovereignty. 
  It is our consistent position to resolve the nuclear problem 
on the Korean peninsula through dialogue. If the United States 
sincerely wants to resolve the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula, it should discard the international anti-Republic 
pressure commotions and come to DPRK-U.S. talks with a sincere 
attitude. 
  Whether the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula can be 
resolved peacefully or not totally depends on the U.S. attitude. 
Besides, international organizations should not follow the 
unjust demands of big nations but should do what is helpful to a 
solution of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula by 
keeping the principle of justice and fairness. 
  [PRENSA LATINA] What are the bases of the foreign policies 
of 
the DPRK and how are its relations with neighboring countries, 
including China, developing? 
  [Kim] The foreign policy of our Republic is based on the 
ideal of independence, peace, and friendship. The ideal of 
independence, peace, and friendship is a just ideal reflecting 
the common aspirations and desire of our people and the 
progressive people of the world to build a new, independent, 
peaceful, and friendly world against various dominations and 
subjugations. 
  Based on this ideal, the government of our Republic is 
actively making efforts to develop friendship and cooperative 
relations with socialist countries and nonaligned countries. It 
concluded good neighbor relations with capitalist countries that 
respect our nation's sovereignty, and is developing economic and 
cultural exchanges with these countries. 
  In particular, the government of our Republic pays deep 
attention to developing relations with our neighboring countries 
in a good manner. 
  The relations between nations cannot develop in a good 
manner 
with the effort of only one side. Among our neighboring 
countries, there are nations that have good relations with our 
country while others do not. 
  The relations between our country and China are good. The 
two countries of DPRK and China are neighbors with a river in 
between, and the Korean and Chinese people are close and 
friendly [chingunhan] comrades-in-arms and brothers who are 
struggling for a common cause. 
  The people of the DPRK and China have fought firmly 
hand-in-hand and by shedding blood against the imperialists. 
They supported and closely cooperated with each other in the 
struggle for socialism. 
  The traditional DPRK-PRC friendship is continually 
developing 
in all domains -- political, economic and cultural -- thanks to 
joint efforts of the parties, governments and peoples of the two 
countries. 
  Japan is also our neighboring country. However, normal 
relations have not been achieved between the DPRK and Japan. 
The Japanese Government implemented hostile policies against 
our country in the past. Recently it is disturbing a solution 
to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula by taking part in 
the United States' anti- Republic maneuvers, and is attempting 
to pursue its insidious political and military purposes. 
  If the situation on the Korean peninsula is aggravated and 
an unexpected state [puluiui satae] is formed, it will not be 
good for Japan, either. 
  The Japanese Government should look at the reality and act 
with discretion. 
  [PRENSA LATINA] As a socialist country, what policy is the 
DPRK adopting concerning foreign countries' investment in its 
territory? 
  [Kim] It is the consistent policy of our Republic's 
government to expand and develop economic and technological 
exchanges with various world countries on the basis of building 
a self-reliant national economy. In accordance with the further 
development of our self- reliant socialist economy on the basis 
of modern technology, our foreign economic relations, too, will 
expand and develop in various forms such as joint ventures and 
collaboration as well as trade. This is of help to our economic 
building, and is also compatible with the progressing tendency 
of international economic cooperation. 
  We have enacted and promulgated relevant laws, including the 
Foreigners Investment Law, with a view to encouraging foreign 
investors to make investments within the boundary [yongyok] of 
the Republic, protecting their investments, and to guaranteeing 
their legitimate rights and interests on the basis of complete 
equality and reciprocity. 
  As is already widely known, we have proclaimed the 
Najin-Sonbong District a free economic trade zone, and have been 
providing a more favorable environment and conditions for 
foreign investments in this zone. Because of its vast economic 
potential and favorable natural, geographical conditions, the 
Najin-Sonbong free economic trade zone, which is located on the 
border area of Korea, China, and Russia, is attracting great 
interest from foreign investors, and there are many countries 
hoping to invest in this zone. 
  If foreign investors make investments in the Najin-Sonbong 
Free Economic Trade Zone, this will greatly contribute to 
expanding and developing the regional economic cooperation and 
the economic and technological exchanges among various world 
countries. 
  The government of our Republic is always opening doors of 
investment to foreign investors. 
  [PRENSA LATINA] What do you think of the prospect for 
Korea's 
reunification? 
  [Kim] The division of our nation imposed by outside forces 
has been continuing for nearly half a century. It is the 
supreme task of the nation--which cannot be put off even for a 
moment--to end the tragedy of the national division and realize 
the reunification of the fatherland. 
  Our party and the government of the Republic are making all 
efforts to realize by all means [ottokehana] the historic cause 
of the reunification of the fatherland in the nineties. We put 
forth the 10-point program for the grand unity of the whole 
nation for the fatherland's reunification last year. The 
10-point program for the grand unity of the whole nation 
reflects the unanimous desire of all Korean compatriots in the 
North, the South, and abroad who wish to realize the nation's 
reunification and prosperity by firmly uniting as one while 
transcending the differences in ideologies, ideas, and systems. 
  We have hoped that the people in the South Korean authority 
come out on the path to reconciliation and cooperation by 
responding to our 10-point program for the grand unity of the 
whole nation. This notwithstanding, turning their face away 
from the whole nation's desire for reunification, they have been 
traversing the road to dependence on outside forces and to 
confrontation between the North and South. 
  The present regime in South Korea is a flunkeyist, 
nation-selling one which is following the outside forces in a 
thorough way. Due to the maneuvers of opposing reunification 
and provoking a new war by the people in authority in South 
Korea, there lay a grave obstacle and difficulties on the road 
before our people aspiring to the fatherland's reunification. 
But, we are optimistic about the prospect of the fatherland's 
reunification. 
  Our nation is a homogeneous one with a long history of 5,000 
years. No force can divide our nation into two forever. The 
fatherland's reunification is a unanimous wish and a vital 
demand of the whole nation. Those running counter to this are 
only a tiny fraction of the flunkyist, nation-selling force. 
  It is inevitable for a nation, which has artificially been 
divided by outside forces, to be reunified into one. The forces 
aspiring for reunification will surely overwhelm and be 
victorious over the splittist forces. 
  We have already put forth the most reasonable method for the 
fatherland's reunification, too. The method for the 
fatherland's reunification in the form of a confederal system 
based on one nation, one state, two systems, and two 
governments--we have put forth--is a just and realistic way for 
reunification which can help realize the country's reunification 
in an above-board manner, in an independent and peaceful way, 
and in the quickest fashion,--while one neither swallows up, nor 
is swallowed up [mokgona mokiujianko] by another--under the 
circumstances in which different ideologies and systems exist in 
the North and South of Korea. 
  The formula for fatherland reunification based on a 
confederal system foresees our country developing into a neutral 
state without becoming a satellite state of another country or 
joining in any political and military alliance or bloc after our 
fatherland is reunified. For this reason, this complies with 
the earnest desire of our neighboring countries and the 
peace-loving countries of the world. 
  As long as all fellow countrymen unanimously yearn for the 
reunification of the fatherland and as long as we have the most 
fair and aboveboard and realistic proposal for fatherland 
reunification, the historic cause of the fatherland's 
reunification will be achieved without fail. 
  At this opportunity, I express my deep appreciation to the 
Cuban party, government, and people for always positively 
supporting our people's cause of the fatherland's reunification. 
  [PRENSA LATINA] How do you assess the relations between your 
country and Cuba, and how do you recall your meeting with 
Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz. 
  [Kim] Though Korea and Cuba are far apart with an ocean and 
a 
continent in between, the friendly ties between the people of 
the two countries are close like neighbors. 
  The friendship between the people of our two countries is 
militant friendship between class brothers who oppose 
imperialism and struggle for victory in the socialist cause and 
a genuine and solid friendship based on revolutionary principle 
and comradely loyalty. 
  The friendly and cooperative relations between our two 
countries have been developing on a new high stage since we and 
Comrade Fidel Castro met. I still emotionally recall our 
meeting with Comrade Fidel Castro in 1986 in Pyongyang. At that 
time, we had our historic first meeting that we had looked 
forward to for a long time and talked and conversed in a 
comradely atmosphere. 
  The leaders of our two countries discussed the issue of 
further expanding and developing friendly and cooperative 
relations between Korea and Cuba and various other matters of 
mutual concern, reached a consensus of views on all issues under 
discussion, and further consolidated our intimate relations. 
  Comrade Fidel Castro's visit to our country left an 
unforgettable impression on our people. Comrade Fidel Castro's 
visit to our country was followed by unanticipated complicated 
events in the international arena. However, the friendly and 
cooperative relations between our two countries are continuously 
developing according to the spirit, which was agreed on during 
the meeting between the leaders of the two countries, without 
shaking even in the vortex of history which determines the 
destiny of socialism. 
  The Cuban people are heroic people who are solidly defending 
the socialist post in the Western Hemisphere under difficult 
circumstances in which the imperialists are continuously 
maneuvering to isolate and crush [korip apsal] them. 
  Our people highly assess the fraternal Cuban people for the 
fact that they are excellently carrying out strategic tasks in a 
special time in a peaceful period [pyonghwa sigiui tukpyol sigi] 
after strongly uniting around the Communist Party of Cuba led by 
Comrade Fidel Castro, the outstanding leader of the Cuban 
revolution, and extend full support for and firm solidarity with 
them. 
  Further expanding and developing friendly and cooperative 
relations between Korea and Cuba is the common desire of the 
people of the two countries, and marching under the uplifted 
banner of socialism in our two countries would greatly 
contribute to defending and maintaining the socialist cause and 
carrying out the cause of independence for mankind. 
  The Korean people will also in the future make every effort 
to develop the friendly and cooperative relations with the 
fraternal Cuban people. 
  I convey my friendly greetings to the fraternal Cuban people 
and sincerely wish that the Cuban people will bring about 
greater achievements in their struggle to defend the 
independence and sovereignty of the country and build socialism.

<F P=106> ["U.S., Mastermind of Nuclear Proliferation" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Board of 
Auditors reportedly submitted a report May 17 to the effect that 
the United States "exported more than 1,500 items of material 
and equipment useful for manufacturing nuclear weapons" to 
different countries including Israel from fiscal 1988 to 1992. 
  This is a very serious act turning the nonproliferation 
treaty into a mere sheet of paper and an unpardonable criminal 
act arousing a high vigilance of the international community. 
  This lays big hurdles in the way of building a nuclear-free 
world and poses a grave threat to the existence of mankind. 
  The United States, the mastermind of nuclear proliferation, 
is taking issue with the peaceful use of nuclear energy by the 
DPRK and urging it to "implement the nonproliferation treaty" as 
regards its "nuclear issue." This reminds people of a thief 
crying "stop thief." 
  It is ridiculous of the United States to try to brand the 
DPRK as a nuclear criminal with a fiction of "nuclear issue of 
North Korea" invented as part of its anti-socialist, anti-DPRK 
campaign. 
  It is the United States that must stand in the dock before 
the international community as a criminal state of nuclear 
proliferation because it hinders the denuclearisation of the 
world by exporting nuclear weapon-grade material and encouraging 
the emergence of potential nuclear-weapon states. 
  The United States, instead of vilifying the peaceloving 
DPRK, 
must apologize to the international community for its criminal 
encouragement of nuclear proliferation in violation of the 
nonproliferation treaty and no longer hinder the building of a 
nuclear-free world.

  [Text] A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman released the 
following statement [tamhwa] on 19 May concerning the exposure 
of an extra-large case -- the concealment of 70 kg of plutonium 
at the nuclear fuel-making factory in Japan. 
  The statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman: 
  Recently, the true color of Japan as a nuclear criminal was 
dragged into the light of day, causing quite a stir 
internationally. As was already reported, an extra-large case 
of the concealment of 70 kg of plutonium at the nuclear 
fuel-making factory in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, was 
disclosed. 
  Japan had so far boasted of its uprightness, claiming that 
it 
had opened to the public the amount of plutonium it had 
stockpiled and had accepted strict inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. It was disclosed 
recently, however, that the Japanese authorities had not 
declared the amount of plutonium needed for the manufacture of 
more than nine nuclear warheads in the total inventory of 
plutonium, keeping it secret. This clearly showed their kind of 
shamelessness. The concealment of plutonium is a violation of 
universally recognized international law, which should be taken 
seriously and denounced. 
  The case also clearly indicates that the so-called three 
non-nuclear principles advertised so often by Japan are nothing 
but a screen for concealing a large quantity of plutonium and 
pushing ahead with nuclear armament in real earnest. Japan's 
noisy row over our nonexistent nuclear issue, taking the van in 
the intrigues to stifle the Republic, is nothing but a petty 
guile to veil its nuclear armament and divert the public 
attention elsewhere. 
  The Japanese authorities, caught red-handed, are these days 
making excuses by talking about the so-called probe into the 
truth and removal of suspicion, but no one will believe that. 
  Judging from the fact that many nuclear facilities of Japan 
have been in operation for several tens of years, it is too 
self-evident that the recently discovered plutonium is nothing 
but an extremely tiny part of the amount concealed in Japan. 
  International circles are now demanding that the IAEA 
Secretariat treat Japan's production and concealment of 
plutonium as a grave case and take relevant measures. It says 
if the IAEA Secretariat never takes issue with the dangerous 
nuclear activities of Japan and continues to make the matters 
complicated only over our fledgling peaceful nuclear activities, 
throwing suspicion on nonexistent nuclear development, it cannot 
be construed otherwise than an application of a double standard. 
  The IAEA Secretariat must pay due attention to this issue in 
compliance with the principle of impartiality. 
  The United States, which has used our nuclear issue for a 
sinister political purpose, calling for a cooperation system to 
stifle our Republic, joining hands with Japan, the real nuclear 
criminal, cannot evade the responsibility for this case, either. 
  We do not feel any need to make further argument about the 
poor lot of the South Korean authorities [tangguk], who have 
recklessly made a fuss about our nuclear issue, currying favor 
with the United States and Japan, the two big powers. While 
the South Korean people in authority [tanggukjadul] ran about 
like mad, following Japan, the latter did what it wanted. What 
a ridiculous sight they are. 
  The Japanese authorities must declare to the international 
society the exact total amount of plutonium now concealed 
nationwide, and immediately stop nuclear armament. 
  We consider that under the circumstances it has been 
confirmed as a fact that Japan's nuclear armament is being 
promoted to the danger line and the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula has become practically meaningless. 
  We appeal to [hosohanda] the governments of all countries, 
international organizations, and antinuclear organizations to 
make unbiased efforts to remove the danger of nuclear 
development from our planet and, in particular, to launch a 
joint action to check the nuclear armament recklessly 
accelerated by Japan with the ambition of becoming a military 
and a nuclear power.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa expressed hopes Friday for the resumption of framework 
trade talks between Japan and the United States. 
  Speaking to reporters after Thursday's bilateral trade talks 
in Washington, Kakizawa said, "I hear the talks began in a 
friendly atmosphere. The U.S. negotiators are apparently going 
to consider the Japanese proposals and it seems they will also 
be taking a constructive attitude." 
  Tokyo has dispatched two senior officials -- Sozaburo 
Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs, and 
Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs 
-- to the closed-door meeting. 
  In comments made after Friday's cabinet meeting, Kakizawa 
said he has learned that the bilateral meeting is expected to 
continue Friday. Asked whether he would visit the U.S., Kakizawa 
said he would like to make a decision after receiving more 
reports on the talks.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 19 KYODO -- The United States 
sounded cautiously optimistic about mending troubled trade ties 
with Japan Thursday [19 May] as senior Japanese and U.S. 
officials opened a fresh round of exploratory talks on how to 
salvage a market-opening agreement between the two countries. 
  "We had a good start," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor told reporters after emerging from a 40-minute opening 
session with the Japanese delegation. 
  Officials from the two sides huddled for several hours 
behind 
closed doors at the office of the U.S. trade representative as 
they weighed terms and conditions for resuming stalled trade 
talks under the so-called "framework" agreement concluded last 
July. 
  Japanese and U.S. officials taking part in the talks, which 
are expected to stretch over into Friday, maintained a virtual 
news blackout on what transpired across the negotiating table. 
  Kantor said the two sides "had an exchange of detailed 
ideas," but declined to shed any light on what the Japanese 
officials are offering for resumption of the framework talks. 
  The trade talks, which are aimed at widening foreign access 
to the Japanese market and reducing Japan's vast trade surplus, 
broke down in February after Tokyo rejected U.S.-proposed 
yardsticks to measure Japanese imports. 
  Japan's Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, in talks with President 
Bill Clinton over the phone shortly after he took office in late 
April, has promised to work to get the talks back on track. 
  Tokyo dispatched two senior officials -- Sozaburo Okamatsu, 
vice trade minister for international affairs, and Sadayuki 
Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs -- for the 
exploratory talks after Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa held 
another round of telephone conversations with Kantor last week. 
  "The fact that the foreign minister and the prime minister 
directed these officials to come here ... for discussion is at 
least a potentially hopeful sign," Kantor told a congressional 
subcommittee Thursday. 
  While Kantor says the U.S. has set no "time limit" for a 
deal, one obvious deadline is June 30 when the U.S. Government 
is due to decide whether to cite Japan for discriminating 
against U.S. firms on government procurement of medical and 
telecommunications equipment. 
  Both industry sectors are among the priority areas covered 
under the framework negotiations. 
  Meanwhile, in an television interview Thursday, U.S. 
Commerce 
Secretary Ron Brown reiterated that Washington will insist on 
"measurable, monitorable results" in fashioning a trade 
agreement with Tokyo. 
  Brown, speaking after fresh trade data showed that the U.S. 
trade deficit with Japan jumped 25.4 percent to 5.80 billion 
dollars in March, warned that sanctions against Japan remain an 
option if there is no improvement in trade ties. 
  "You have vehicles such as (Super 301 trade sanctions) to 
use 
when necessary. That is not said in any kind of threatening 
way. We have not made any decisions as to whether use that but 
that is certainly an option available," Brown said in the 
interview.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The Budget Committee of the 
House of Councilors began discussions Friday [20 May] on 
supplementing the stalled stopgap budget after an agreement was 
reached over Diet testimony concerning a dispute involving 
Komeito. 
  The deliberations began after the ruling coalition and 
opposition parties agreed to accept Committee Chairman Kichio 
Inoue's compromise proposal to the Liberal Democratic Party's 
demand to summon a former lawyer for Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist 
sect that backs Komeito. 
  Both sides agreed to Inoue's proposal to start debate on the 
stopgap budget and then conclude the issue of Diet testimony by 
the time the upper house starts discussions on the full state 
budget for the current fiscal year, which began April 1. 
  The LDP is demanding that Masatomo Yamazaki, a former legal 
adviser to the Buddhist sect, testify before the committee over 
relations between Komeito and the politically active Buddhist 
organization. 
  The ruling coalition, which includes Komeito, is opposed to 
the demand. 
  In the committee session, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, in 
response to questions by an LDP lawmaker on a controversial news 
report, denied he brought a letter from Soka Gakkai head Daisaku 
Ikeda to the Pope during his recent European tour. 
  Hata said he believes that Komeito is independent of Soka 
Gakkai's religious teachings or activities. 
  Komeito is a key component of the minority coalition that 
backs the Hata administration. 
  Friday's agreement to discuss supplementation of the 
provisional budget came just before the stopgap budget was to 
expire Friday. 
  The Diet has yet to start debate on the full budget for the 
current fiscal year due to political turmoil over former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's shady financial dealings, which 
forced him to resign on April 8. 
  During the agenda-setting meeting for the committee, the LDP 
accused the coalition of "abnormal handling" of Diet business 
that caused the delay.

  [Text] Australia has expressed reservations about the size 
of the new United Nations mission for Rwanda. Foreign Minister 
Gareth Evans says Australia will not offer troops to the force 
until there is a proper mandate and enough soldiers to do the 
job. 
  Senator Evans said it was unclear whether the Rwanda 
operation could be done with the 5,500 troops proposed by the 
United Nations, and he said there was some distance to go before 
the Security Council decision could be translated into something 
that was workable in Rwanda. 
  The international medical aid organization Doctors Without 
Borders says the deployment of United Nations troops to Rwanda 
may come too late to help save thousands of Rwandan civilians. 
It urged the Security Council to speed up deployment, saying 
that there are hundreds of people facing systematic slaughter.

  [Text] MANILA, May 20 (AFP) -- President Fidel Ramos said 
Friday that foreign participants of a planned human rights 
conference on East Timor, opening in Manila later this month, 
would be banned from entering the Philippines. Their presence 
at the privately organized May 31-June 3 meeting would be 
"inimical to the national interest," a presidental palace 
statement said. 
  The regional conference had sparked a diplomatic row between 
Manila and Jakarta, with the latter threatening retaliation if 
it takes place. Ramos cited the planned participation of Jose 
Ramos-Horta, a special representative of the East Timor 
resistance. He ordered Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon to 
"take immediate steps to exclude such persons and other 
non-Filipino conferees." 
  On Thursday, Indonesia, angry at the East Timor seminar, had 
threatened to scrap a meeting it had organised between Manila 
and group of Filipino Moslem rebels. The meeting is due to take 
place next month.

<F P=106> [From the "Talk on International News and Current Events" </F>
program] 
  [Excerpts] The international media has lately expressed 
concern over exploration activities in Vietnam's Changshas 
[Spratlys] and near Thanh Long (Blue Dragon) reef by China and 
the U.S. Crestone Corporation. Following are excerpts of 
comments carried by the international press over this issue: 
  In an article in the 6 May issue of the INTERNATIONAL HERALD 
TRIBUNE, Philip Bowring said the international media was 
astonished when, two years ago, the U.S. Crestone Energy 
Corporation announced that China had awarded it an exploration 
block in an area 250 kilometers southeast of Vietnam and 500 
kilometers from Malaysia, but 1,300 kilometers from China's 
Hainan Island. [passage omitted on the TRIBUNE report] 
  According to an ASSOCIATED PRESS report, U.S. lawyers and 
oceanography experts stated on 12 May that, Vietnam's 
reiteration of its territorial and sovereignty claims over the 
Changshas seems rational and understandable. [passage omitted on 
the ASSOCIATED PRESS report] 
  Writing in the March issue of the NATIONAL DEFENSE MAGAZINE, 
Navy Officer (Henry Labrook) said a check against the archives 
of the French Foreign Ministry will show that the Changshas are 
Vietnamese territory. [passage omitted on NATIONAL DEFENSE

  [Text] Tokyo -- At a House of Councillors Budget Committee 
meeting on 20 May, Minoru Tanba, treaties bureau chief at the 
Foreign Ministry, commented on the allegation that during 
negotiations on Okinawa's reversion to Japanese control, Japan 
and the United States concluded a "secret agreement" that allows 
the United States to reintroduce nuclear weapons to Okinawa in 
case of an emergency. Tanba expressed a negative view about the 
binding power of the secret accord even if it actually exists. 
He said: "The Japan-U.S. Joint Communique signed by then Prime 
Minister Eisaku Sato and President Richard Nixon was a political 
document on Okinawa's reversion to Japan. It is unthinkable 
that they also issued agreed minutes to the communique. Even if 
such documents exist, they are not binding because they were not 
compiled by administrative organizations in accord with law." 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also stressed that the government's 
policy of "refusing reentry of nuclear weapons to Okinawa or 
other parts of Japan" would not change even if an emergency does 
take place. Both Tanba and Hata made these remarks in answering 
questions from Japan Communist Party members Koichiro Ueda and 
Yoshinori Yoshioka. 
  Referring to the allegation in a book authored by Kei 
Wakaizumi, Ueda asserted that it is now evident that the secret 
agreement was signed, saying: "Can't you still deny (the 
existence of the secret agreement)? I want the government to 
investigate the allegation because this is an issue that affects 
the fate of the nation." 
  In response, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said: 
"Negotiations on Okinawa's reversion were made through official 
diplomatic channels and as a result, the two governments agreed 
on the reversion. There were no private channels." He added: 
"Granting that there were private channels, I do not think they 
affected the final result of the negotiations." 
  In a question related to this issue, Yoshioka asked "whether 
the secret agreement, made in the form of agreed minutes, would 
be binding on Japanese cabinets." Treaties Bureau Chief Tanba 
and Foreign Minister Kakizawa answered his question on the 
assumption that the secret agreement exists. Tanabe said: "Its 
secret nature does not invalidate the agreement. At any rate, 
(the agreed minutes in question) were not made in accord with 
law." Kakizawa also stressed: "The agreement is invalid, so 
you do not have to worry." 
  In answering a question on the need to investigate the 
allegation and ascertain the facts about the secret agreement, 
Prime Minister Hata said: "Former Prime Minister Sato is 
already dead. So I have no idea about how we should 
investigate." Asked about the need to notify the United States 
of the invalidity of the agreement, Foreign Minister Kakizawa 
said: "It is unnecessary because the government does not admit 
its existence."

  [Text] "The whites' society is a hunting society; they 
would catch as much game as possible while it is there." That 
was an allegory Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General 
Secretary Ichiro Ozawa used in describing his view of diplomatic 
techniques used by European nations and the United States -- 
speaking at a lecture in Ofunato city on 21 May. 
  He reiterated his long-held view, saying: "Even if you asked 
them to understand you better, that would be no use," and 
insisted Japan should assert itself more. He talked tough, 
declaring: "They [Japanese negotiators] would say there is no 
way out for Japan, and then step back 50 steps or even 100 steps 
when they could have taken only 10 steps back. They ought to 
know that negotiations are deals."

  [Text] Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and 
industry, reported on the 1994 trade white paper to the cabinet 
on 1 May and the cabinet approved it. Calling "investment a 
source of growth," the white paper points out that "the 
government can no longer keep investment and technology in their 
closets" and expresses concern about the fact that "foreign 
direct investment in Japan is the lowest compared with that in 
major industrialized nations." The white paper stresses that to 
accelerate growth, the government should address price 
differentials between Japan and other nations, promote 
deregulation, and attract more foreign investment to Japan while 
encouraging domestic investment. The white paper applauds the 
Uruguay Round for hammering out a set of agreements on new 
international trade rules. The white paper emphasizes that Japan 
should vigorously support activities of the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), which is slated to be inaugurated next year. 
  Analyzing the world trade structure, the white paper 
indicates that it is going through drastic changes in the wake 
of growing foreign investments. It points out that growth in 
global direct foreign investment largely exceeded the growth in 
the global trade of goods and services during the second half of 
the eighties. The white paper notes that the increase in global 
direct foreign investment has served to spur technology and 
interbusiness trade, promote industrialization in nations where 
foreign direct investments were made, and expand the trade in 
manufactured goods. 
  The white paper notes that ASEAN members, China, and East 
Asian nations that have received foreign investments have 
greatly increased their manufactured goods exports and adds that 
the ratio of the trade undertaken by East Asian nations (with 
the exception of Japan) to the entire world trade swelled about 
2.6 times over the past 20 years since 1972. Describing 
Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, as a "center of growth," the 
white paper emphasizes that Japanese enterprises should use the 
region as their business base not only for exports, but for 
research and development and shape their respective strategies 
for market expansion in the region. 
  Pointing out that "investment will accelerate growth and 
create job opportunities in the long run," the white paper 
proposes that, to expand investment and create job 
opportunities, attempts should be made to efficiently distribute 
resources through trade liberalization and expanding the world's 
production and income. 
  Indicating that Japan's direct domestic investment balance 
in 
1991 was $15.2 billion, 1/27th of that made by the United States 
during the same year, the white paper says the rate between 
domestic and foreign direct investment balances made by Japan 
during the year was 1:17 compared with the 1:1.1 of the United 
States. Noting that "Japan's direct domestic investment can 
serve to vitalize its economy," the white paper stresses the 
need to turn Japan into a nation where business activities are 
attractive to both domestic and foreign enterprises. The white 
paper stresses the need for the government to: 1) upgrade the 
infrastructure and housing; 2) correct the price differentials 
between Japan and other nations; and, 3) relax business 
regulations. 
  The white paper points out that domestic savings need to be 
used for upgrading the infrastructure to prepare for a society 
of senior citizens, adding that the measure will serve to reduce 
Japan's current account surplus, which hit an all-time high in 
1993. 
  Commenting on a set of agreements hammered out in the 
Uruguay 
Round (of GATT) that was concluded late last year, the white 
paper applauds "the Uruguay Round for laying down trade rules on 
service and intellectual property." 
  The white paper stresses that, for the set of agreements to 
be put into effect, Japan should vigorously support activities 
of the WTO, which will become an international body mandated to 
handle international trade matters.

  [Text] The government has decided to announce--jointly 
with Indonesia and Australia--a proposal on setting up a "PKO 
[Peacekeeping Operations] Center" in the Asia-Pacific region at 
the "ASEAN region forum" to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, in 
late July. The PKO Center will enable the ASEAN forum 
participating nations to conduct joint exercises on UN-required 
PKO, and exchange information relating to them. 
  The government will present this concept first at the 
high-level working meeting for the ASEAN expanded foreign 
ministers' conference to be held in Bangkok 22 May. 
  Explaining the decision to propose the inauguration of the 
PKO Center, a Foreign Ministry source noted: "With the Cold War 
ended, the international community is now in quest of a new 
world order. Meanwhile, there are increasing conflicts and 
confrontations over territorial, ethnic, or religious issues, 
and there is a growing need for PKO." 
  What the PKO Center is hoped to achieve is: 1) to enable PKO 
personnel to improve mutual communications by conducting joint 
exercises, thus enabling them to have smooth relations with each 
other at the PKO sites; 2) to enable the Asian nations to have a 
better understanding on the Japanese Self-Defense Forces' 
participation in PKO; 3) and to enable the Japanese Government 
to gain information on the areas where PKO are ongoing or are 
expected to be undertaken, thus providing useful information to 
Japan--which has to meet five conditions to participate in PKO 
under law--in making decisions as to whether it should or should 
not take part in certain operations. 
  As far as the government is concerned, it also hopes to get 
public agreement domestically on the question of the country 
participating more actively in PKO, and thus hopes to use this 
opportunity as an stimulus in getting the current PKO Law 
revised next year. The law bans the country's participation in 
UN peacekeeping forces (PKF). 
  The forthcoming ASEAN forum will turn out to be the first 
security talks in the Asia-Pacific region, and member nations of 
the ASEAN extended foreign ministers' conference and other 
countries, such as China, Russia, and Vietnam, are expected to 
attend. The holding of the forum was agreed on at the last 
session of the ASEAN extended foreign ministers' conference. 
The most important purpose for the forum is for the 
participating nations to exchange views on security situations, 
and to gain mutual trust among these nations. As a specific way 
to build up trust among the nations, the Japanese Government 
wants to propose setting up the PKO Center, and also to discuss 
the topics of ensuring transparancy in defense policies by 
requiring the nations to issue defense white papers, and holding 
meetings of defense-related personnel and conducting mutual 
exchanges. Japan will be represented by Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa at the forum.

  [Text] It has been learned that a Japanese trading firm has 
rescinded a contract which it had concluded with Russia to 
export its decommissioned submarines through intermediary trade 
to North Korea for use as scrap. 
  The Japanese trading company took this action after the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] asked it to 
stop the intermediary trade. However, Russia has resumed the 
export of its decommissioned submarines to North Korea without 
giving it prior notice. As a result, the uproar over the export 
of Russia's decommissioned submarines to North Korea has now 
subsided, leaving unanswered the question of whether the Russian 
decommissioned submarines are militarily useful. 
  The Japanese trading firm in question is Toen Trading 
Company 
(based in Tokyo). It concluded the contract with Russia under 
which it was to buy 12 decommissioned submarines from the 
Russian Defense Ministry for export to North Korea for 
dismantling and reexport as metal scrap to China. 
  The Japanese trading firm exported last January one of the 
12 
decommissioned submarines to North Korea. MITI, however, 
intervened in this intermediary trade, claiming, "The trade may 
violate the Foreign Exchange Management Law that prohibits 
Japanese companies from engaging in any intermediary export of 
weapons" and asked Toen Trading Company to stop the intermediary 
trade. In response, the company exchanged a letter of 
confirmation with the Russian side that "Russia will keep the 
contracted submarines in place as they are until MITI approves 
the intermediary trade." 
  On 12 May, however, the NHK broadcast a video showing 
Russian 
submarines being shipped from Vladivostok to North Korea. Russia 
appeared to have embarked on direct deals with North Korea 
without giving prior notice to Toen Trading Company. The 
Japanese trading firm has decided to revoke the contract with 
Russia after receiving no answerers to its queries. 
  After examining photographs submitted by Toen Trading 
Company, MITI has concluded that "Russia's decommissioned 
submarines in question are so badly obsolete that they cannot be 
used as weapons." It, however, has been cautious about approving 
intermediary trade by asking Russia to allow on-the-spot checkup 
of the decommissioned submarines in view of the controversial 
issue of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. 
  Now that the Japanese trading firm has revoked the contract, 
MITI need not make a judgment on "the sticky issue" (says a 
senior MITI official). 
  Although MITI still says "we need to ask the Russian side to 
confirm if the contract has actually been revoked and that the 
issue has yet to be resolved completely," it appears to be 
feeling no anxiety about the knotty issue.

  [Text] On 16 May, the government decided it should not be 
too insistent in mentioning the pending Japan-Russia issue over 
the northern territories in a statement to be adopted at the 
Naples summit (seven industrialized nations talks) in July. 
This was disclosed by a Foreign Ministry source. 
  Giving a reason for this decision, the source noted the 
"Tokyo Declaration" issued by Japan and Russia last October 
confirms the validity of the 1956 Japan-Soviet Joint 
Declaration, which clearly states the return of two of the 
northern islands to Japan. The source said: "Basically, this 
is an issue that should be discussed bilaterally from now on." 
The government also appears to be thinking that separating the 
territorial issue from the Russian aid question would be more 
helpful in gaining understanding of the international community 
[on its policy over Russia]. 
  Words of support for a "settlement" of the northern 
territories issue have been included in political declarations 
and chairmen's statements three times since the Houston summit 
(in the United States) in 1990. But at the Tokyo summit held 
last year, direct reference to the dispute was avoided on the 
ground that "this was already a known fact among G-7 (seven 
industrialized) nations." Instead, a political statement issued 
by the summit expressed hope that Russia will "promote diplomacy 
based on the principle of law and justice." 
  The issue of how to handle the matter was raised again this 
time because Russia is now expected to take part in political 
discussions in the Naples summit. 
  However, the government apparently has arrived at the 
decision because "the course of negotiations has already been 
set" (according to the source) by the Tokyo Declaration issued 
when Russian President Boris Yeltisn visited Japan last fall. 
The government is also aware that the summit-participating 
nations want to keep declarations and statements issued simple 
this time, and appears to be giving consideration to Russia, 
which is expected to join political discussions at the summit.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] Japan, which not only ranks first in the world in 
providing official development assistance (ODA) but also is the 
second-largest financial contributor to major international 
organizations after the United States, is one of the most 
important financial contributors in the world. On the other 
hand, however, despite Japan's financial contribution, the 
number of Japanese working for international organizations is 
far less than that of foreigners. Staff members of 
international organizations are required to remain neutral as 
international servants. However, there is the expectation that 
they will serve as an important diplomatic channel for their 
respective countries. In view of this, there is concern that 
the lack of Japanese staffers in international organizations 
will affect Japan's efforts in forming its future international 
strategy. 
  Since 1991, the World Bank, which finances long-term 
development loans with low interest rates to developing nations, 
has sent a staff member to its Tokyo office as a manager of 
Japanese staff members. The reason the World Bank is seeking 
Japanese for staff members is that "since Japan's ODA has 
increased, it has increasingly become necessary for us to 
promote a dialogue through Japanese staff members with the 
Japanese Government on policies for helping developing nations" 
(according to the World Bank Tokyo office). 
  However, at present, the number of Japanese working for the 
World Bank headquarters is 100, 2.11 percent of the total staff 
members. Those Japanese staff members are all in senior posts, 
such as economic analysts. As far as a ratio of appropriation 
of funds to the World Bank is concerned, Japan comes second to 
the United States (17.4 percent). But when a percentage of 
staffers is considered, Japan is not only far behind the United 
States (25.62 percent) but also falls behind the UK (7.16 
percent), whose funds appropriation ratio is 4.6 percent, which 
is lower than Japan's. 
  Even in other international organizations, including the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the number of 
Japanese staff members is far less than other nations. Although 
Japan is the second-largest financial contributor to both the 
IMF and OECD following the United States among five 
industrialized nations (Japan, the United States, Germany, the 
UK, and France), the number of staff members working as expert 
or senior officials is the smallest. 
  Yasushi Takase, professor of Tokai University Law Department 
who worked for GATT for nearly 30 years and retired in March 
1992, said that underlying Japan's falling behind in providing 
human resources contribution is the fact that, "besides the lack 
of language proficiency, Japanese interest in working for 
international organizations is languishing due to a sharp 
increase in salaries in Japan." 
  However, it is strongly requested both at home and abroad 
that the Japanese Government increase its staff members so that 
Japan will be able to have more diplomatic channels to foreign 
nations and Asian nations' policies can be reflected in policies 
of the international organizations. It can be said that "it is 
time for Japan to send competent personnel from government 
organs and the private sector to international organizations 
that are strategically important to Japan" (as stated by 
Professor Takase).

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Diplomatic Bluebook Reflects Political </F>
Confusion"] 
  [Text] The Diplomatic Bluebook issued annually by the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] is a report to the people on 
the state of Japanese diplomacy. At the same time, it also 
outlines Japan's foreign policy for those both at home and 
abroad. In this respect, it is our impression that the 1993 
bluebook is rare for the character of its message. 
  Of course, several of the bluebook's descriptions of current 
affairs do take on the tone of a message, and the following is 
an example. 
  "An economic power second only to the United States, Japan 
has now come into being as a nation with considerable influence 
not only in the economic realm but also regarding fundamental 
problems in all fields of international society, including 
political aspects and problems of a global scale." 
  This was probably meant to ask people to focus on the way 
Japan is viewed by other nations. Of late, much use has been 
made of the expression "a small but shining nation" to describe 
Japan but, in the eyes of the world, Japan is not a small 
country at all. 
  "It is necessary for Japan to pursue a positive and an 
abundantly creative diplomacy to provide direction for a new 
international framework and to participate in its construction," 
according to the report. This could be an indication of Japan's 
diplomatic position in dealing with an international situation 
that "continues to be fluid and opaque." 
  However, the problem is that the annual report is abstract 
and does not set forth Japan's position on individual issues in 
concrete terms. 
  A representative example is the section on Japan's seeking 
permanent membership in the UN Security Council [UNSC]. 
  It is well known that for some time the MOFA has strongly 
hoped Japan would attain a permanent seat on the UNSC. However, 
the bluebook remains unnaturally vague on this score, making no 
direct reference to the question. It just quotes indirect 
references to reform of the United Nations from a speech former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa delivered at the UN General 
Assembly last September. 
  When the bluebook was written, the Hosokawa administration 
was still in power and, with the governing coalition parties 
having different basic policies, this may have affected the way 
the report was compiled. 
  In putting the latest bluebook together, a new procedure 
unknown during the era of Liberal Democratic Party rule was 
introduced. The report was submitted to teams from the ruling 
parties dealing with various ministries and agencies and to 
policy executive boards for discussion before being presented to 
a cabinet meeting for approval. Therefore, abstractions and 
indirect expressions were no doubt unavoidable in light of 
conflicting views within the coalition. 
  That was the background then and it is hardly surprising, 
therefore, that a gap became apparent between the bluebook's 
tone and Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's highly enthusiastic 
approach to the issue of a permanent UNSC seat after taking over 
from Hosokawa. 
  The aforementioned factors were no doubt reasons why the 
bluebook failed to concretely spell out how Japan should cope 
with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear arms and 
Japan-U.S. trade friction. 
  The bluebook said that "national consciousness has not 
necessarily caught up with the international community's 
increased expectations for Japan." This section can be taken to 
mean that the MOFA was exasperated by the political situation at 
home. 
  We believe that the recent political disarray, which 
affected 
even the bluebook's content, must be brought to an end as soon 
as possible.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Foreign Ministry Pushes Japan's Bid for </F>
Permanent Membership on the UN Security Council"] 
  [Text] At least one task has surfaced abruptly and 
noticeably within the Hata government--the issue of Japan 
joining the UN Security Council as a permanent member. 
  In his policy speech to the Diet and in statements made 
during his stay in foreign nations, Prime Minister Hata has 
frequently mentioned Japan's bid for permanent membership on the 
UN Security Council. At a Brussels news conference, he said: 
"Japan is being asked by the rest of the world to fulfill its 
duty as a permanent member of the UN Security Council." His 
rhetoric contrasts with that of the Hosokawa government, which 
mentioned Japan's bid for permanent membership of the UN 
Security Council in guarded and indirect terms. 
  There are reasons why Hata makes frequent mention of Japan's 
bid for permanent membership on the UN Security Council. 
  In contrast to the Foreign Ministry, which has been eager 
for 
Japan to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, 
neither the Hosokawa nor the Miyazawa governments were very 
keen. Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary in the 
Hosokawa government, and Yohei Kono, president of the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party, have also been negative about Japan 
becoming a permanent member. At a meeting of the task force 
mandated to reform the UN Security Council, Yoshio Hatamo, 
former Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, delivered a 
speech which made very clear Japan's eagerness to join the UN 
Security Council. In reaction, however, then Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Takemura quite openly expressed his discontent with 
the speech. 
  Nonetheless, the Foreign Ministry did not back down. 
Whenever leaders of other nations visit Japan, the ministry 
tries to include expressions of their support for Japan's 
permanent membership on the UN Security Council in joint 
statements and news releases. The Foreign Ministry has steadily 
created a climate in which Prime Minister Hata could justly 
state: "Japan is being asked by the rest of the world to 
fulfill its duty as a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council." 
  The way the Foreign Ministry has handled the issue of 
Japan's 
bid for permanent membership, though, appears to have toughened 
Mr. Takemura's attitude. 
  The foreign minister moved to the Prime Minister's Official 
Residence after a change of government. Ichiro Ozawa, secretary 
general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], who maneuvered 
behind the scenes for Mr. Hata's promotion to the premiership, 
is eager for Japan to expand its international contributions, 
including its military contribution. It can be said that, 
inspired by Mr. Ozawa's eagerness for Japan to make 
international contributions, the Foreign Ministry has moved to 
trumpet the need for Japan's permanent membership on the UN 
Security Council. 
  But why has the Foreign Ministry clung to Japanese 
affiliation with the UN Security Council? One reason we can 
cite is the statement made by Under Secretary General James 
Jonar [name as published] of the United Nations that "the UN 
Security Council is now being transformed into a board of 
directors." The General Assembly of the United Nations, with 
more than 180 members, has been too slow in taking action and 
that the UN Security Council is about to become a body mandate 
in the management of international issues. 
  Three years ago the UN Security Council held weekly 
sessions, 
now it holds them daily, with the exception of holidays. Most 
of the session is given over to informal discussion. Japan is 
the biggest financial contributor to the United Nations, 
following the United States, but Japan has to wait outside the 
door of the UN Security Council. It is not strange, then, that 
even Foreign Ministry officials say: "We want to see Japan 
attending sessions in the capacity of a full, permanent member." 
  However, the question remains, "what can Japan do after 
becoming a UN Security Council permanent member." 
  The U.S. Senate adopted in late January this year a 
supplementary resolution asserting that "Japan should not be 
allowed to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council 
unless it is prepared to participate in UN peacekeeping 
operations (PKO) including the use of force." 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who visited Japan in 
March this year, said: "The permanent member nations of the UN 
Security Council have both rights and obligations. They have an 
obligation to participate in PKO when it is decided by the UN 
Security Council." 
  Although Japan has to positively work to join the UN 
Security Council, the question of whether Japanese laws 
currently in force are compatible with Japanese affiliation with 
the UN Security Council as a permanent member still remains 
unanswered. Revamping those laws will have much to do with 
Japan's exercise of its collective right to self-defense, the 
topic of frequent debate at home. If Japan fails to make clear 
its attitude toward revamping those laws and exercising its 
collective self-defense right, it would cause misgivings among 
Japanese and misunderstanding among other nations. 
  It is already known that the United States supports both 
Japan and Germany becoming permanent members of the UN Security 
Council in the hope that they will increase their financial 
contributions to the United Nations. Other nations, too, hope 
to become permanent members of the UN Security Council and there 
are no rational criteria for deciding one rather than another. 
In addition, developing countries have demanded reform of the 
UN Security Council. 
  The bluebook on foreign policy released on 13 May points out 
the "slow pace" of the response by Japanese news media and the 
Japanese to international expectations of the country, saying: 
"Awareness in Japan has failed to keep pace with the 
international community's growing expectations of Japan." 
  We have the impression that the Foreign Ministry has been 
pushing the issue of Japan's bid for permanent membership of the 
UN Security Council unilaterally.

  [Text] On the evening of 19 May, a senior Foreign Ministry 
official spoke with regard to the question of Japan becoming a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council [UNSC], and, while 
noting it was his personal view, said: "Japan should have veto 
power if it wants to have its stand accepted [in the United 
Nations]." 
  This is the first time that a senior government official 
spoke in favor of having veto power equal to that of the five 
existing member countries--the United States, Russia, China, the 
UK, and France. Germany has also expressed hope that it would 
become a permanent UNSC member with veto power. 
  But the senior official added he would not be too insistent 
on having veto rights.

  [Text] In response to Fair Trade Commission [FTC] 
guidance, the three major automakers--Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan 
Motor Co., Ltd., and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.--have corrected 
their own conventional transaction system with affiliated auto 
dealers. With the new corrected system, the dealers will be able 
to deal in more foreign-made autos. The purpose behind the 
automakers' change in the dealership system is to promote auto 
dealers' sales of foreign-made autos by changing a system of 
rebates paid by automakers to dealers and by abandoning a system 
of allocating sales areas (territory system). As far as a 
dealership contract concluded in 1991 between automakers and 
dealers is concerned, the auto manufacturers allow the dealers 
to sell foreign-made automobiles. The recent change in the 
transaction system will further promote the dealers' sales of 
foreign-made autos. In this way, the dealers will be able to 
engage in sales activities more freely while consumers will have 
more choices in buying automobiles. Since the United States, in 
negotiations on easing the auto trade dispute with Japan, has 
pointed out the closed nature of Japan's auto dealership system, 
it is possible that the recent move by the three major 
automakers will have favorable impact on deadlocked Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. 
  In late April, the three automakers, including Toyota, 
submitted to the FTC a measure to correct the conventional 
transaction with affiliated dealers, and they recently adopted 
the new dealership system. The FTC formerly pointed out that 
the conventional agreement between automakers and dealers -- 
that the automakers will pay dealers a rebate commensurate with 
the degree of reaching their sales target which is set by the 
automakers but is very hard to achieve and that a rebate will 
not be applied to sales of autos which are sold outside the 
dealer's allocated territorial sales area -- is questionable, 
saying the agreement might run counter to the Antimonopoly Law, 
under which "an act of restricting affiliated dealers' sales of 
other makers' automobiles and of limiting sales areas" is 
prohibited. 
  In the past, setting up dealers' sales targets, Toyota 
conducted a "sales campaign" for almost a year and paid a rebate 
commensurate with the number of cars sold. But under the new 
system, Toyota has halved the campaign period and cut the amount 
of rebate to be paid per auto sold. In the past, Toyota paid a 
rebate based on its system of evaluating affiliated dealers. 
Toyota based its evaluation of the dealers on the volume of 
transaction and the sales share in their respective territorial 
sales areas. However, Toyota has decided not to emphasize the 
sales share in paying rebates. 
  Like Toyota, Nissan, in evaluating its affiliated dealers' 
sales performance, which is a base for a rebate system, has 
decided to place more emphasis on the autos actually sold not 
only within the dealers' allocated sales territory but also 
outside the territory. Meanwhile, Mitsubishi has decided to 
apply a rebate to autos sold outside dealers' sales territories. 
  The dealership contract between an automaker and a dealer 
allows the dealer to freely sell automobiles outside their 
allocated sales areas. In fact, however, major auto 
manufacturers have so far adopted a system of "one dealer, one 
prefecture," for certain types of autos, and the dealer received 
from the automaker a rebate calculated on the total number of 
cars sold. But it was pointed out that such a practice limits 
sales areas. 
  On the contrary, in the United States and Europe, a rebate 
system is generally adopted for each type of auto, not for the 
total number of autos sold. In the United States, automakers 
get involved in setting up dealers, but they do not limit sales 
areas. As far as the rebate system is concerned, it can be said 
that the recent change in the dealership system has paved the 
way for dealers to deal in as many foreign-made cars as 
Japanese-made ones.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has come up with a procedure for controlling textile 
imports. MITI will set up an investigation committee within the 
ministry, and at the request of the domestic textile industry, 
the committee will investigate textile trade to judge whether 
the domestic textile industry is seriously damaged and hold 
bilateral negotiations with a trade partner. After the 
negotiations, it will decide on whether it will restrict textile 
imports. European nations and the United States have safeguard 
measures under which they can unilaterally restrict imports of 
textile products if it exceeds certain volume. In contrast, 
MITI's procedure places more emphasis on bilateral negotiations 
rather than automatically and unilaterally taking safeguard 
measures. Underlying this policy is that Japan hopes to 
maintain good political relations with Asian nations, which are 
major textile exporters to Japan. 
  The committee, which will be jointly led by chiefs of MITI's 
International Trade Policy Bureau and Consumer Goods Industries 
Bureau, will conduct investigations to determine if it is 
necessary to invoke its import control procedures. The 
committee will release its investigation results after hearing 
opinions from the Export-Import Transaction Council as well as 
from consumers and the distribution industry. After the 
investigation report's release, the committee will launch 
negotiations with a trade partner. 
  Such a procedure will be Japan's own safeguard based on the 
GATT Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA). Although Japan's procedure 
meets international rules, it is unprecedented for Japan, who 
has become the world's second-largest economic superpower owing 
to the free trade system, to establish a protectionist procedure. 
  However, since the import restriction does not suit Japan's 
principle of maintaining the free trade system, MITI plans to 
give priority to taking other measures such as antidumping 
measures if applicable.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Calm Reaction Needed To Foreign Apple Imports"] </F>
  [Text] Foreign apples -- on which an import ban had long 
been placed because of quarantine problems -- have been put on 
the Japanese market for the first time. It is expected that 
following New Zealand-grown apples, which had been banned for a 
long time, the government will also lift a ban on American 
apples. Although there is strong opposition by domestic apple 
growers, there will be no reason for the Japanese Government to 
reject foreign nations' requests to import when the quarantine 
problems are settled technically. 
  Although Japan's apple market was liberalized in 1971, 
almost 
no foreign apples have been imported to Japan so far. In fact, 
import of foreign apples was prohibited by the Pest Control Law 
based on the International Pest Control Treaty. 
  To clear the problem hampering export of its apples, the New 
Zealand Government has made great efforts to establish a 
pest-control system. After inspecting New Zealand apples, the 
Japanese Government judged that New Zealand-grown apples are 
safe to eat, thus lifting the ban last year on New Zealand-grown 
apples. This year, the first shipment of New Zealand apples 
arrived in Japan. At the same time, it has also become possible 
for Japanese apple growers to export their apples to New 
Zealand, and a small amount of apples was exported last autumn. 
  The United States for its part, since 1986, has been calling 
on Japan to import American apples. In response, the Japanese 
has repeatedly rejected the U.S. demand on the grounds that 
quarantine requirements were not met. The United States then 
said that Japan is intentionally delaying its granting of 
quarantine approval to American apples, repeatedly saying that 
the apple trade has become a political problem as one of unfair 
trade areas. 
  Every time the United States applies pressure on Japan, we 
have stressed that the quarantine issue should be settled 
technically and criticized the U.S. attitude. At the same time, 
we have called on the Japanese Government to take fair action. 
Last April, the Japanese inspection team made an on-site 
inspection of U.S. pest-control methods and systems. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] 
recently announced its decision to lift the ban as early as this 
autumn on imports of American apples, saying American apples now 
meet quarantine requirements. It is a matter of course for MAFF 
to decide on imports because the quarantine problems were solved. 
  Imports of foreign apples give consumers a variety of 
options. However, we are concerned about how it will affect 
domestic apple growers. Since production costs for American 
apples, which are harvested during Japan's off-season, are lower 
than Japan's, domestic growers are concerned that imports of 
American apples will have a great impact on their jobs. 
Meanwhile, some say it is questionable whether American apples 
suit Japanese consumers' tastes because American apples are 
smaller than Japanese ones and most of them, in general, belong 
to the "delicious" type. Production of this type of apple has 
sharply decreased in Japan. 
  Past liberalization of other fruit markets, such as 
grapefruit, cherries, and oranges, had less impact on domestic 
ones than expected. As for apples, there is no guarantee that 
domestic apples will not be affected by foreign apples. But 
domestic apples have the advantage of being produced to suit the 
Japanese people's tastes. In addition, they are fresher than 
foreign apples. 
  Domestic apple growers should not become unnecessarily 
confused. We hope that they will make further efforts to cut 
production costs and improve the quality of their apples so that 
their competitive power will increase. Producing a higher grade 
of apple is one way to attract consumers. In addition, 
consumers will probably welcome cheaper and more uncontaminated 
apples even if they are not well-shaped or well-colored. 
  Furthermore, we suggest the domestic apple growers, taking 
advantage of this opportunity, seriously consider exporting 
their apples. It is said that people in Taiwan and Hong Kong 
prefer Japanese apples as gifts. Although the United States 
also bans the import of Japanese apples for quarantine reasons, 
it is expected to allow Japanese apples to come into the U.S. 
market when the Japanese Government lifts the ban on American 
apples. We think that Japanese apples are favorably compared 
with those grown in other nations. We hope that the domestic 
growers will demonstrate the quality of their apples in the U.S. 
market.

  [Text] The government will hold a trade conference (to be 
chaired by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata) on 15 June to discuss 
import-increasing measures at both the government and 
private-sector levels in an effort to reduce Japan's trade 
surplus. It will invite financial representatives from foreign 
countries to Japan for the first time to hear their opinions on 
such issues as deregulation measures in connection with foreign 
firms' access to the Japanese market. The Japanese industrial 
circle will also brief on its efforts to expand imports and will 
make requests to the government. In response, the government 
plans to reflect their opinions and requests in concrete 
measures in an outline of reforming external economic relations 
to be worked out at the end of June. 
  The government has decided to invite foreign representatives 
to Japan because it has concluded that it is necessary to hear 
opinions directly from foreign businessmen in order to increase 
imports.

  [Text] It was learned on 2 May that the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] mapped out a package 
of reform programs for the current food control system three 
years ago to overhaul the current food control system which puts 
the production, distribution, and sales of rice under the 
government's direct control, switching them to the "government's 
indirect control" and limiting the government's role to the 
stockpiling and quarantine of rice. The Agricultural 
Administration Council is expected to hold full-fledged debates 
on the food control system on the eve of Japan's partial opening 
of its rice market. Although Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries Minister Mutsuki Kato has said "The government still 
intends to keep the current food control system in place," the 
package of reform programs for the food control system is likely 
to greatly affect the debates. 
  The package of reform programs mapped out by MAFF is 
comprised of a "reform program for rice management policy" and a 
"reform program for the tariff system on imported rice." 
According to an informed source, MAFF mapped out the package in 
late 1991 when pressure was building on Japan to open its rice 
market at agricultural negotiations under the Uruguay Round of 
GATT. The final draft agreement put forth by then GATT Director 
General Dunkel included the principle of "tariffication without 
exception" which aimed to replace all import restrictions with 
tariffication. 
  The package of reform programs that SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained 
on 2 May gives a "very dire picture" of the current rice 
production in Japan and points out that "the people ask the 
government to provide a smooth supply of rice in response to 
changes in the demands of consumers for rice and to deal 
properly with the growing trade of rice in black markets." The 
package stresses that its primary objective is to "take 
advantage of rice tariffication to overhaul the current food 
control system and build a new rice control system under which 
Japanese rice growers enthusiastically work in paddy fields and 
the needs of consumers are met." 
  Specifically, the package calls for a full relaxation of the 
current paddy-field reduction system (production adjustment) and 
stresses the need to transfer the body responsible for enforcing 
the system from the government to such producer organizations as 
the National Federation of Agricultural Cooperative 
Associations. The package also calls for the creation of a 
system under which rice growers themselves decide whether to 
reduce their paddy fields, and under which there is a "price 
guarantee," with the area of paddy field and the variety of rice 
established to get rice growers to resume production. The 
package calls for the creation of another system under which the 
difference between the "standard sale price" and actual sale 
price by rice growers is paid to rice growers. 
  The package of reform programs points out the need to 
replace 
the current license system with a simple application system for 
collectors and wholesalers in the distribution system and to 
liberalize the distribution of rice by abolishing various 
restrictions. The package calls for introducing futures 
transactions in rice wholesale markets that open under the 
government's licenses, but makes it mandatory for wholesalers to 
obtain licenses from the government to participate in the rice 
wholesale markets. 
  The package of reform programs aims to largely acknowledge 
the freedom to produce rice, the freedom to sell it, and the 
freedom to buy it on the principle of market and competition by 
overhauling the current food control system which makes it a 
principle for the government to control the rice. 
  Under a new rice management policy, the government will only 
work out the basic plan for production and distribution of rice, 
and its stockpiling and quarantine. The package of reform 
programs, however, acknowledges the government's management of 
rice in case of an emergency situation like the recent rice 
crisis following the poor 1993 rice crop.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Cut Corners of Deregulation Package"] </F>
  [Text] Although the government is scheduled to work out 
deregulation measures by the end of June, it's stand of carrying 
out deregulation is still questionable. This is because certain 
ministries and agencies seem to have turned to be negative about 
deregulations following the inauguration of the minority 
government. We cannot allow them to take such negative 
attitudes. On 13 May, the Federation of Economic Organizations 
of Japan [Keidanren] handed over to Prime Minister Hata a 
request calling for carrying out drastic deregulations for 196 
items in seven areas of business such as land and housing, 
information and communications, goods distribution, and 
agriculture. We believe Keidanren must have perceived such a 
negative atmosphere within ministries and agencies. 
  The government sets deregulation measures as a main pillar 
of 
its market-opening package -- aimed at stimulating the sluggish 
Japanese economy and its appetite for imports -- scheduled to be 
worked out in June. Deregulatory steps are preconditions for 
rectifying trade imbalance; creating more transparent, open 
markets; and maintaining domestic demand-led economic growth. 
The prime minister, after a meeting with Keidanren on 13 May, 
in which he was strongly urged to take deregulatory steps, 
called a first meeting with his select ministers including 
foreign and finance ministers and confirmed with them a stand of 
positively coming to grips with the issue. As reflected in this 
issue, politicians are required to take leadership also in the 
area of deregulations. It is expected that deregulation can 
help create new business chances, thus leading to stimulating 
the nation's economy. On the other hand, it is painful for 
certain business circles which have long enjoyed their vested 
right and for authoritative ministries and agencies to promote 
deregulation. It is statesmen's role to promote deregulation 
while breaking down the resistance of bureaucrats. 
  Foreign nations are taking increasing interest in Japan's 
deregulatory steps. At the meeting of select cabinet members, 
Foreign Minister Kakizawa said European nations and the United 
States are calling for various deregulation measures including 
the easing of the Building Standards Act and the Large-Scale 
Retail Stores Law and the expediting of customs services at 
airports. At an Office of Trade Investment Ombudsmen meeting 
held on the same day, a deregulation proposal was presented 
calling for easing 21 regulations, including one that limits 
driving licenses for large motorcycles -- which is very 
difficult to obtain -- to help foreign-made products get access 
the Japanese market. The proposal also says the time required 
for obtaining import permission for cosmetics and perfumes 
should be shortened. 
  If the government fails to come up with full deregulatory 
steps in spite of growing calls for deregulation, Japan will be 
exposed to foreign nations' harsh criticism. 
  Of course, deregulation is not meant only to meet requests 
of 
foreign nations. In fact, more emphasis should be placed on 
boosting Japan's economy. Deregulation is a prerequisite to 
boosting the domestic demand in Japan, which is required to 
reform its economic structure. It is unavoidable for Japan to 
carry out deregulation no matter what the political situation is. 
  When handing over its written deregulation request to the 
prime minister, Keidanren asked the government to adopt three 
principles: 1) "zero-base principle" -- that requires the review 
of all existing regulations; 2) "sunset principle" -- that 
requires the abolishment or review of newly introduced 
regulations at least five years after introduction; and 3) 
"openness principle" -- that requires the holding of open 
hearings when new regulations are introduced. 
  We believe these are very important. It is hoped that the 
government will come up with a deregulation package in light of 
Keidanren's requests. 
  For example, the demand for mobile phones has drastically 
increased recently, thus leading to a short supply of products. 
In addition, there is a plan afoot by some local towns to brew 
their own beer. It is apparent deregulation on mobile phones 
and brewing businesses are contributing to boosting the demand 
for mobile phones and local towns' brewing plans. 
  There is a lot of business chances in the Japanese market. 
The government should not nip such business chances in the bud. 
Carrying out deregulation is also urgently required in view of 
encouraging the private sector to stand by itself.

  [Text] On 17 May, the Administration Reform Promotion 
Headquarters (chaired by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata) disclosed 
a rough draft of an advisory report on deregulation proposals 
for real estate policies. The report is expected to be 
finalized by the headquarters' Housing and Real Estate Policies 
Subcommittee before the end of this month. 
  The advisory report calls for relaxation of industrial 
standards so that the Japanese construction market can accept 
building materials approved by foreign standards. Regarding 
real estate development, the advisory panel takes a prudent 
stance toward a sweeping relaxation of regulations on building 
volumes. On the other hand, the report advocates a review of 
local government authorities for controlling land development 
projects, noting local government bodies are excessively strict 
to developers. 
  The Housing and Real Estate Policies Subcommittee has 
already 
submitted the draft report to the headquarters. Hereafter, the 
draft will be finalized by cabinet ministers composing the 
Administration Reform Promotion Headquarters, and the final 
draft will be incorporated in the outline of external economic 
measures which will be released in the end of June. 
  The subcommittee's draft report is calling for "deregulation 
measures focused on urban areas," and, in tangible measures, 
deregulation requests are made in 39 fields. 
  With respect to housing construction policies, the report 
proposes the following deregulation measures: 1) international 
standards and inspection data from foreign countries should be 
broadly approved for accepting foreign-made building materials; 
2) Japanese standards, such as the Japan Industrial Standards 
(JIS) and Japan Agricultural Standards (JAS), should be relaxed; 
and 3) water service departments and energy supply companies 
should review their contractor systems to break certain local 
contractors' monopoly for service work. 
  The advisory report is likely to arouse controversy on its 
note that local government bodies' development guidance policies 
have "some excessive restrictions." On that ground, the report 
says local governments "must stop" allotting sewerage work 
charges to developers. Local governments are likely to react 
strongly to the proposal considered "lenient to developers."

  [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries [MAFF] has decided on an early compilation of a 
package of reform plans for the food control system, which 
stipulates the government's control over the entire rice market. 
MAFF intends to work out the reform package in July, a year 
earlier than its initial plan. The reform package includes the 
following measures: 1) The compulsive allotment of rice 
production cuts should be discontinued so that farmers can 
choose between free business and farm subsidies; 2) "black 
market rice" should be legalized by allowing direct deals from 
farmers to wholesalers; and 3) an additional rice reserve quota 
should be provided to prepare for serious rice shortages. In 
view of public criticism of the food control policy, the 
government is going to "relax' its control over the rice market 
for the first time in the last half century. 
  A MAFF source said the reform package includes an 
"alternative rice-paddy reduction policy." Under the policy, 
MAFF intends to discontinue its rice production cut policy 
imposed on all rice farmers at the wholesale level, and to allow 
the farmers' own discretion on whether or not they cut their 
production. 
  The government will keep offering subsidies and guarantee 
the 
minimum price of products to those who agree on rice production 
cuts. However, those who pick free production will have to deal 
with the free market at their own risk. The government hopes 
most farmers follow its rice production cut policy. 
  When the new policy is implemented, free-production farmers 
will have no duty to sell their products to the government. 
This means free production comes with free distribution. Upon 
the abolition of governmental control over the entire rice 
market, the free rice market would not be called a black market 
anymore. 
  Regarding the rice reserve policy, MAFF will provide a new 
rice reserve quota called the special reserve, which amounts to 
several hundred thousand tons, in addition to the ordinary rice 
stock of over a million tons. The special rice reserve is 
intended for emergencies, livestock feed, and food aid to 
developing countries. Funds for the special rice reserve is 
expected to be raised with profits from the distribution of 
foreign-grown rice imported according to the minimum access 
accord. 
  The government will continue to compile annual rice supply 
plans even after the food control policy's revision, aiming at 
stabilization of the Japanese rice market's demand-supply 
balance. However, MAFF intends to characterize the rice supply 
plans just as guidelines for farmers and distributors, and let 
them submit detailed production and sales plans annually to 
maintain indirect control over the market. 
  MAFF plans to announce such directions of the rice policy 
reform in July. The reform measures will be finalized in view 
of deliberations of the (prime minister's advisory) Agricultural 
Policy Commission now in session, and, within the summer, MAFF 
will start compiling a revision of the Food Control Law. Some 
of the reform measures are expected to take effect in fiscal 
1995. 
  In the initial plan, MAFF defined reform of the food control 
policy as a long-term subject. However, its rigid rice policies 
are being criticized from various quarters. MAFF decided to 
work out the reform plan this coming summer since "we have to 
swiftly prepare tangible reform measures and implement it as 
soon as possible" (as noted by a senior MAFF official).

  [Text] The Ministry of Construction [MOC] mapped out final 
measures designed to impose strict penalties against 
construction companies whose directors or employees were 
involved in bid-rigging or bribery for public works project. 
The MOC already approved a decision that it can order 
construction companies to suspend business for one year at most 
if they are found guilty of bribery and other crimes in regards 
to public works project. However, the MOC firmed up its 
decision this time to: 1) consider bid-rigging in violation of 
the Antimonopoly Law as subject to business suspension; and 2) 
impose more than one month of business suspension in case of 
bribery and more than 15 days in case of bid-rigging that 
violate the Antimonopoly Law. At the same time, the MOC will 
also introduce a minimum period of business suspension. The MOC 
wants to publicly announce criteria for the measures by next 
week and to start their application as early as August after 
about three months notification. The ministry will also inform 
local governments, which are in a position to supervise local 
contractors, of the measures and to ask them to adopt similar 
criteria. 
  A decision to determine whether a process of selecting a 
contract winner is bid-rigging can be made on the basis of 
either criminal law or the Antimonopoly Act. Evidence that can 
prove a contract winner was selected through discussions is 
sufficient to prosecute a suspect on the basis of the 
Antimonopoly Act. In a case of prosecution based on criminal 
laws, however, it is necessary to prove, among other things, 
that companies involved in such a process actually gave or 
accepted money. Therefore, very few companies were arrested for 
violation of criminal laws. So far, the MOC has only given 
written warnings to construction companies who were involved in 
bid-rigging in violation of the Antimonopoly Act. However, they 
will be ordered to suspend business if the new criteria are 
applied. Business suspension will be imposed after a suspected 
company accepts the Fair Trade Commission's warning against 
bid-rigging or when the same commission determines that 
bid-rigging actually took place. 
  Regarding the issue of introducing a minimum period of 
business suspension, the MOC will set a period almost equal to a 
period for which a construction company is taken out of a list 
of nominated contractors when it's executives or employees are 
arrested or indicted for bid-rigging. As for criminal 
prosecution regarding bribery and bid-rigging in violation of 
criminal laws or the Antimonopoly Law, a construction company 
will be ordered, in principle, to suspend business for three 
months at least if its executive, who has the right to represent 
the company, is found guilty. It will be two months if an 
ordinary employee or a branch manager of a company is involved 
in bid-rigging. Less than one month of business suspension will 
be ordered if an employee of lower rank is involved. A 15-day 
business suspension will be ordered regardless of rank if the 
Antimonopoly Law is violated. A construction company will be 
ordered to suspend business for a maximum of one year if it 
fails to take adequate measures to prevent the recurrence of 
bid-rigging. 
  If it is ordered to suspend business, a construction company 
branch office will be banned from all activities to win 
contracts. In the past, there was no distinction between 
privately funded projects and public works as far as the 
application of penal measures were concerned. Therefore, only a 
maximum of 15 days of business suspension was imposed against 
bid-rigging for fear that "a long-term business suspension may 
drive companies to bankruptcy."

<F P=106> [First installment of four-part article by Shinobu Takeda of </F>
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's Industrial News Department: "Centennial 
Change in the Construction Industry"] 
  [Text] In response to the recent bribery scandals involving 
the central and local political worlds, as well as every major 
general contractor, it has been decided to introduce a general 
competitive bidding system for public works to replace the 
designated bidding system which had been in practice since the 
Meiji era. "Dango" [bid-rigging], a practice of coordinating 
the selection of contractors among construction companies, is 
going to be abolished. The construction industry, which has 
530,000 firms and approximately 6 million directly employed 
workers in the country and shares more than 10 percent of 
Japan's Gross National Product (GNP), is now entering an 
unprecedented turning point in its history: a change in the 
100th year. 
<H5>  No Longer Involved in Coordinating Contract Winners </H5>
  "While we have no intention of stealing a march on other 
companies in the dango group, our main office directed us not to 
take part in coordinating the winner of a contract." The 
remarks of a person who is in charge of public works sales at 
Shimizu Corporation this year threw general contractors, who had 
been discussing the selection of a contractor for a dam 
construction project in the Hokuriku district, into an uproar. 
Three leading general contractors, Shimizu Corporation, Taisei 
Corporation, and Kajima Corporation, have already said that they 
will part with the bid-rigging system. Those companies retired 
from the frontline as agents for bid-rigging in the central 
construction industry, and the bid-rigging organization there 
has dissolved. In spite of all these changes, other contractors 
had assumed optimistically that the trend to eliminate 
bid-rigging was yet to affect the local construction industries, 
and that is why they are shocked. 
  A medium general contractor which has been selected to be 
the 
winner for the dam construction project from among the firms in 
the dango group says, "We desperately tried to find out 
Shimizu's bid price." If Shimizu's bid price, decided 
independently by itself, is lower, the company selected in the 
bid-rigging will not be able to win the contract. The major 
premise of dango is that all the companies that are going to 
place a bid participate in it. Besides, the level of bid price 
can be very low if Shimizu, the top in the industry in terms of 
sales, is going to place a bid by its own criteria. 
  This medium general contractor bid at the lowest possible 
price according to its financial strength and managed to win the 
contract. Shimizu's bid price was higher than previously 
expected. Although the person in charge of the project at the 
company complained, "We could have gained about 100 million yen 
more in profit," this is the result of the price competition 
between "bid-riggers" and "Shimizu." 
  In face of the Fair Trade Commission, the construction 
industry has kept the practice of bid-rigging by going 
underground deeply. A person (deceased) in charge of 
bid-rigging at a major general contractor, who was once the 
secretary of the central bid-rigging organization, left the job 
of finding a place for the dango meetings to his son so as not 
to leave any trace. The chairman of the bid-rigging group at 
that time was Sukemasa Uera, former adviser of Tobishima 
Corporation, and the adviser of the organization was a prominent 
figure of a major trading company. Since a room at a hotel or a 
Japanese restaurant is not safe enough, a condominium was 
purchased under an individual's name, and remodeled so that a 
meeting could be held. [The secretary] even sent cooks from his 
home to prepare meals for the meeting in order to avoid the use 
of delivery services. 
<H5>  Other Companies Will Follow Sooner or Later </H5>
  But all these efforts may end in vain. Shimizu is certain to 
go its own way in bidding on other public works projects, too. 
Some companies will follow Shimizu in the future. Bid-rigging, 
which was famous for its firm unity, has now begun to rust, even 
before the Fair Trade Commission begins to exercise its power. 
  When the chairman of the central bid rigging organization 
changed from Uera to Kajima's Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama, 
the construction industry voiced concern if he "is all right." 
While bid-rigging had a function to control the selection of 
contractors so that contracts will not be monopolized by the 
major contractors, the people in the industry suspected that 
"Kiyoyama will always choose Kajima to be the winner for a 
contract." Leaving the discussion of whether bid-rigging is 
socially fair or not, the mechanism of bid-rigging to assure 
fairness within the industry was already collapsing during 
Kiyoyama's era. 
  However, bid-rigging is not unique to the construction 
industry. The same kind of system exists among architecture 
companies. A major designing firm reveals that the "post office 
is the point." In bid-rigging, the dango chairman selects a 
company for a contract in a way that the awarding of contracts 
does not concentrate on a single firm by referring to past 
records. Nevertheless, there is even a better trump than the 
past records. A company which finds an unpublished project 
first has the priority in bid-rigging. 
  In order to prove the date of discovery, "a post office is 
used." The location of the project is marked on a map, then the 
map is put in an envelope and sealed. After that, one rushes to 
a post office and simply has the envelope postmarked. At a 
bid-rigging meeting, the envelope is opened to claim the 
company's priority. The designing companies require much more 
time to change their consciousness. 
  Favorable Argument Unjustifiable 
  The head of a construction company of a South Korean 
financial cartel once said, "I envy Japan because bid-rigging is 
possible there. Since there is a company to steal a march on 
other companies, this practice is difficult in South Korea." 
This executive is in favor of bid-rigging for the following 
reason. While Western countries urge that "bid-rigging should be 
eliminated," their social structure is well prepared. On the 
other hand, in the developing Asian countries, the construction 
industry, which is responsible for improving infrastructure, 
will be impoverished by price competition and will not be able 
to accomplish its tasks unless the selection of contractors for 
public works projects is controlled by bid-rigging. 
  Argument for bid-rigging does not hold water in today's 
Japan 
which has developed economically. But, the thought that 
"bid-rigging was necessary during the period when Japan was 
developing" still lingers at the hearts of the executives of 
Japan's construction industry. At a general meeting of the 
construction industry held at the beginning of this year, an 
owner-president of a semi-major general contractor blurted out, 
"Still, bid-rigging is necessary or we are in trouble." 
However, he retracted his words after he was severely scolded 
by other participants who said, "what if the Fair Trade 
Commission happens to learn your remarks?" The psychology of 
people in the industry has not changed since the days Japan was 
developing.

<F P=106> [Second installment of four-part article by Shinobu Takeda </F>
of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's Industrial News Department: 
"Centennial Change in Construction Industry"] 
  [Text] "If the budget is approved by the Diet, there are 
approximately 150 government-related public works projects 
alone, worth more than 700 million yen, to be contracted under 
the open competitive bidding system," Motoyuki Kidokoro, chief 
of Ministry of Construction's Technical Research Office, says. 
However, there are doubts in the construction industry about 
"how many of the public works could actually be carried out even 
if the Diet passes the budget." Under the current situation, 
the execution of public works cannot be carried out without the 
cooperation of general contractors. The construction industry 
fears that the open competitive bidding system, which distances 
itself from general contractors, could be an obstacle to the 
execution of public works. 
<H5>  Getting Contracts Not Guaranteed </H5>
  On 25 February, 1,200 people assembled at the main hall of 
the first floor of Pacifico Yokohama, an international 
conference hall at Minato Mirai in Yokohama. They were 
construction contractors who had come to learn about the reform 
of the bidding system for Yokohama City's public works projects. 
Regarding that the designated bidding system, in which 
contractors selected by a government office based on their past 
business records and confidence compete to win a contract, 
became the hotbed of bid rigging, the Construction Ministry 
[MOC] and local autonomous bodies decided to introduce the open 
competitive bidding system. Separation from the familiar system 
raised uneasiness among the construction contractors, and made 
them come to the Pacifico Yokohama. 
  General contractors were able to increase the possibility of 
being designated by the government offices, and hold an 
advantageous position at a bid rigging meeting by cooperating 
with government and municipal offices from the public works 
project's designing stage, which imposes a heavy burden. 
However, under the open competitive bidding system, winning a 
contract for a project that one supported by spending time and 
effort is not guaranteed. Such an uneasiness was not eased even 
after participation in the explanatory meeting at the Pacifico 
Yokohama. 
  Until 40 years ago or so, government and municipal offices' 
own technicians had mainly designed and carried out Japan's 
public works projects. But, since the government offices were 
not able to cope with the sharp increase in the work load of 
public works during the days of high economic growth, they 
entrusted private construction firms with the job of executing 
public works projects, while leaving the job of designing to 
themselves. 
  However, everybody in the industry knows that general 
contractors now "help" the government offices even in the 
designing stage of large-scale public works constructions. 
Acknowledging the situation, the MOC says, "Mapping out a plan 
is becoming no longer the work of clients as the significance of 
environmental assessment and measures to obtain understanding of 
a project from the people in the district prior to execution of 
the project increases." 
<H5>  Possibility of Unsuccessful Bidding </H5>
  The MOC has its own technical research institute, and 60 
percent of its 24,000 workers are engineers. While the MOC is 
still all right in terms of technical experts, the local 
autonomous bodies are much weaker. For example, Ibaraki 
Prefecture's Sanwa-cho, whose mayor was arrested in the general 
contractors' bribery scandal, "does not particularly have an 
expert for designing," according to the town's General Affairs 
Division, and this is not an isolated case. 
  General contractors have sent their valuable architects to 
the government offices to help in a project because the 
construction companies could expect to get a contract for the 
construction of the project later. Besides, earnings for 
designing are much smaller than those for building. If general 
contractors are not guaranteed to receive a contract after their 
cooperation due to the introduction of open competitive bidding 
system, they will become reluctant. 
  The system of placing an order with outside architects and 
paying for it is stipulated in the present reform of bidding 
system. While this is a chance for architecture companies and 
consultants, only Nippon Koei Co., Ltd., the largest company in 
the designing business, can make a plan for a dam. The structure 
in which a designing for a public works project is dependent on 
general contractors is still the same. If general contractors 
withdraw from drawing designs, public works cannot be carried 
out. 
  Also, there is the possibility of unsuccessful case of 
bidding under the open competitive bidding system. In a public 
works project, expenses for machinery and materials and 
personnel are estimated and called the estimated price. Partly 
due to the decline in clients' technology, however, there is a 
case in which a project is estimated at 80 while it actually 
costs 100. Although contractors avoid to take such a contract 
because they make no profit, "usually a company is selected at a 
bid rigging meeting to take the non-profit-making contract 
because reestimating the costs of project by redesigning it will 
loose government's face," an executive of a semi-major general 
contractor reveals. Such a trick [to avoid a situation in which 
no one places a bid for a contract in which no profit is made] 
will not be able to be used from now on. 
  Scale of Public Works Becomes Smaller 
  In addition, the fact that general contractors were excluded 
from public works projects by being suspended from bidding after 
they were investigated in connection with the bribery scandal 
has beclouded the situation. According to the MOC's Statistics 
on Public Works Construction Starts, the appraised value for the 
constructions started from April 1993 to February 1994 is the 
record high of 17.449 trillion yen, which is a 2.9 percent 
increase from the year-ago level. The details, however, show 
exactly two opposite trends: the amount for the national 
government's projects declined 0.7 percent while the figure for 
local governments increased 4.0 percent. Large-scale projects 
by the national government have declined, and small projects 
have increased, such as local municipalities' road constructions 
and sewage maintenance which can be carried out by small and 
medium contractors. 
  "The scale of construction to become small prevents the 
procurement of materials and machinery, such as steel, cement, 
and construction machines, to increase, and as a result, the 
demand usually created by public works becomes small," Hiroshi 
Fujimura, deputy manager of Research Office, Management and 
Planning Department of Taisei Cooperation, says. This is one of 
the reasons why the economy is not recovering while Japan's 
public works have been increased by the government's economic 
stimulus package. 
  While "steady execution of public works," "fulfillment of 
social capital," and "expanding domestic demand" are the 
government's international commitments, other promises such as 
"introduction of open competitive bidding system," and "strict 
employment of Antimonopoly Law" obstruct the realization of the 
former objectives, creating a paradox.

<F P=106> [Third installment of four-part article by Shinobu Takeda of </F>
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's Industrial News Department: "Centennial 
Change in Construction Industry"] 
  [Text] Leading general contractors were all banned from 
bidding for public works projects in relation to a series of 
bribery scandals, and as a result, excluded from public works. 
Also, controls within bid-rigging groups are weakening. 
Unexpected changes at the construction sites of public works 
are emerging nationwide. For example, companies from different 
types of businesses or from other prefectures are winning 
contracts, something inconceivable in the past. Because the 
change is so sudden, local gpvernments and the construction 
industry are not able to cope with it. 
<H5>  General Contractors as Subcontractors </H5>
  Takao Mikoshiba, managing director of Ishikawajima-Harima 
Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. [Ishihari], said in bewilderment, "We 
do not have the experience of using general contractors as 
subcontractors...." His concern results from the fact that his 
company has been awarded a lump-sum contract for not only the 
machinery part but also the civil engineering part of the 
construction of a basement parking lot in Fukui City which is 
worth approximately 51 million yen in total. But, the 
management of engineering works for a machinery manufacturer is 
impossible. Although there is a need to subcontract general 
contractors, they are usually Ishihari's large clients from whom 
it takes up orders for such construction machinery as shield 
drilling machines and cranes. Until the completion of the 
construction due in March 1996, the person in charge of the 
project at Ishihari will not feel relaxed. 
  Many local governments are in trouble because the bribery 
scandals involving general contractors have widened and too many 
companies are disqualified from bidding for public works 
projects. A construction company in Niigata says, "The 
prefectural government mainly awarded contracts to Takenaka 
Komuten Co., Ltd., which was not involved in the scandals. 
However, Takenaka was not able to cope with the task since its 
know-how was limited." 
  Although Obayashi Corporation was suspended from bidding 
because its vice president and executives were arrested on 
suspicion of bribing former mayor of Sendai, it was not excluded 
from the construction of Sendai's Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) 
base. Also, Nagano City has unofficially contracted with a 
joint venture (JV) that includes Kajima Corporation, which was 
barred from bidding in March, for the construction of the main 
structure of speed skate rink for the [1998 Nagano] Winter 
Olympics. 
  Because so many companies were involved in bribery scandals, 
the Sendai City government had to reselect the contractors for 
the LNG base construction project twice before it finally 
contracted with Obayashi and JDC Corporation. Under the 
pressing conditions in which no more delay was allowed because 
the time limit for a change from town gas to natural gas was 
approaching, the Sendai City government had no choice but to 
ignore the fact that Obayashi had been banned from bidding for 
public works projects. 
  The case of Nagano City is the same. Plenty of larch is used 
in building a speed skate rink that has an elaborate wooden 
structure with a suspended roof. Changing the members of the JV 
was impossible because the time left for the construction to be 
completed before the opening of the Nagano Olympics was barely 
enough. Shigeru Ban, Structure Design manager at Kajima which 
designed the rink, said in high spirits, "We will build a unique 
facility that cannot be found anywhere else." 
<H5>  "80 Percent of Estimated Price" </H5>
  Under a conditional open competitive bidding system 
introduced experimentally by the Hiroshima prefectural 
government, Daioh Corporation (Kochi City, President Kusuo 
Yasuoka), a Shikoku-based construction firm, won the contracts 
for the construction of administration building of Hiroshima 
Prefectural Junior College of Health and Welfare at Mihara, and 
tunnel construction for a prefectural road in Fukuyama City. 
The fact that a construction company from a different 
prefecture at the other side of the Inland Sea won a contract in 
Hiroshima has attracted attention as well as the fact that its 
bid price was "80 percent of the prefectural government's 
estimated price," (according to a medium general contractor). 
  "In the construction industry, the overall profit margin for 
completed construction projects is approximately 10 percent. 
When the difference between the estimated price and the bid 
price is larger than that, there is no profit," Kenji Maeda, 
chairman of Japan Federation of Construction Contractors, Inc., 
says. In Hiroshima, the managing director responsible for the 
Hiroshima branch office of a major general contractor is said to 
be still active as the coordinator for a bid-rigging group. He 
has not tolerated a company to place a bid at a low price that 
deviates from the concerted actions of other bid-riggers. But, 
it seems that he was not able to control companies outside the 
prefecture. Things are changing from their roots at the 
forefront of bidding for public works projects in the local 
areas. 
<H5>  Restricting Entry of Companies </H5>
  At the second floor of a building in front of JR [Japan 
Railways] Kannai Station in Yokohama is Purchasing Section, 
Property Custody Division, Planning and Finance Bureau of the 
Yokohama City government. A paper which reads "Businessmen, No 
Entry Please" has been posted next to the reception desk since 
last January. There is also a notice next to it saying, 
"Consultation is offered at the section next to the reception." 
Although some construction companies protested, "Are you going 
not to let us do business?" Terumasa Ikeda, chief of Purchasing 
Section, refuted, "What kind of business activity is possible by 
coming inside our office?" 
  As a matter of fact, whether one can go beyond the reception 
desk and enter the office is a big problem for small and medium 
construction firms. Almost lacking the ability to determine a 
bid price by making estimates on their own, they have used 
former officials of the autonomous bodies and have them talk 
with the person responsible for a public works project to find 
out the estimated price of the project, and used the price as a 
reference up to now. This practice will be no longer possible. 
  "Making an estimate for a project before bidding will cost 
you about 0.5 percent of the amount of a contract, if you do it 
seriously," Tetsu Goto, president of Tokyu Construction Co., 
Ltd., says. Under the open competitive bidding system, a 
construction company might suffer a total loss after failing to 
win a number of contracts. There is a possibility that, "a firm 
that earns about 10 billion yen a year can go bankrupt for the 
estimation costs after placing 10 unsuccessful bids." Prior to 
the introduction of open competitive bidding system, Yokohama 
City held hearings on the new system with the local construction 
companies, and the firms requested one after another to "reduce 
the number of projects to be contracted under the open bidding 
system as much as possible." 
  Many local autonomous bodies have started to consider the 
introduction of entry restriction similar to that of Yokohama. 
It is becoming more difficult for construction companies to 
walk around the lobbies of the government offices and collect 
information. Also in the United States, gathering information 
through former government officials is difficult. Because of 
this, there has been a scandal in which a congressman was used 
to collect information for a bidding from the section in charge. 
"In Japan also, local assembly members might be used," says the 
person in charge at a major general contractor, frowning at the 
next possible cause of corruption.

<F P=106> [Fourth installment of four-part article by Shinobu Takeda </F>
of NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN's Industrial News Department: 
"Centennial Change in Construction Industry"] 
  [Text] The electric power industry invests 5 trillion yen, 
which corresponds to 10 percent of the private sector's demand 
for construction, in plant and equipment every year. In 
particular, major general contractors (comprehensive 
construction firms) stand unrivaled at the construction of 
nuclear power plants. Any construction site is lined with the 
company flags of Kajima, Taisei, and Shimizu. Large-scale civil 
engineering technology and mechanized engineering procedures, 
which have been developed through building the nuclear power 
plants, are the driving force for those companies to lead far 
ahead of other smaller companies, and they have enjoyed the 
name, "super general contractors." 
<H5>  Leading the Construction of Nuclear Reactors </H5>
  Facing the Sea of Japan is the construction site of No. 6 
and 7 reactors of the Tokyo Electric Power Co., Ltd.'s 
Kashiwazaki Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Niigata. At the site 
of No. 7 reactor handled by a joint venture [JV] led by Shimizu 
Corporation, world's largest wheel crane lifts reinforcing rods 
pre-assembled as a rectangular structure of several tens of 
meters, and carries it to the construction site of reactor's 
containment vessel. 
  Next to the No. 7 reactor is the construction site of No. 6 
reactor, which is handled by a Kajima-led JV. All-weather 
construction method is employed in which the entire construction 
field is covered with a temporary roof and walls. Kashiwazaki 
is a prominent area of heavy snowfall in Japan. In order to 
overcome the delay in construction during wintertime, general 
contractors invented an efficient method using large steel 
assembled framework and all-weather construction method. These 
methods are unique to Japan which cannot be found even in the 
Western nations that are advanced in the nuclear power 
technology. 
  The "Atomic Energy Office" was set up in Kajima Corporation 
under the supervision of the fourth president (the late) 
Morinosuke Kajima in 1956, one year after the Tokyo Electric 
Power Co., Ltd. established the "President's Office Atomic Power 
Plant Section", the first organization to bear the name of 
"atomic power." Kajima's former Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama, 
who was arrested in the general contractors' bribery scandal, 
was the young hope of the company then. He was sent to the 
United Kingdom to learn the technology of Calder-Hall Type No. 
1, the world's first commercial nuclear power plant. That 
"[he] studied so hard by visiting various places that his shoe 
got a hole" is still talked about as a legend in the company. 
Morinosuke Kajima did not allow to close the Atomic Power 
Office even when its management accumulated a deficit, saying 
[the investment in the office] was "prior investment." 
  The accumulation of knowledge at that time is now useful. 
Tokyo Electric has started on the reform of bidding system from 
4 April, and it has paved the way for domestic and foreign 
entrants to bid for its projects. However, the construction of 
a reactor's core is handled by the three super general 
contractors. Obayashi Corporation is still the main force in 
the construction projects of the Kansai Electric Power Co., Ltd. 
and Kyushu Electric Power Co., Ltd. 
  Semi-major class contractors tried to absorb the 
construction 
technology through the JVs. Hitoshi Tobishima, adviser of 
Tobishima Corporation says, "All the nine electric companies are 
our clients," but, his company cannot attain the level of the 
four leading companies. In expectation of the demand for 
dismantling reactors after the year 2000, Maeda Construction 
Co., Ltd. has developed its own technology to dismantle a 
nuclear reactor by applying an electric current to the 
reinforcing rods of the reactor's containment vessel. But a 
case like Maeda is rare. 
<H5>  Contractor's Own Research Laboratories </H5>
  Hiroshi Kitamura, vice president of Taisei Corporation, 
proudly says, "Japan's general contractors are the only ones 
among other construction companies in the world which have their 
own research institutes." Each leading company has a laboratory 
that is capable of developing and designing antiseismic 
structures, skyscrapers, and underground cities. However, even 
the research and development expense of Kajima, which is the 
largest, is 22 billion yen. The amount corresponds only to 1.3 
percent of its sales. Taisei's R&amp;D cost is 15 billion yen, 
which is 0.8 percent of its sales. These ratios are merely 
1/10th of the level of Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corporation, 
whose R&amp;D expenses amount to 8 to 10 percent of their sales. 
  Each company has a state-of-the-art supercomputer, and uses 
it for structure analysis and various sorts of simulations. But 
the reality is that "those computers were purchased in return 
for contracts for the construction of semiconductor factories 
and main office buildings," according to a major general 
contractor. The purchase of supercomputers was for more of a 
reciprocal trade than a genuine research and development. 
  The research and development ability of smaller general 
contractors is poor. Japan's first JV was formed only by major 
contractors in order to share the risks involved in the 
construction of a U.S. base after the war. "The JV was so 
powerful that it even asked the Fair Trade Commission whether it 
violated the Antimonopoly Law," according to Kajima. But, 
without one's knowing it, the nature of JV has changed to a 
"convoy" in which small general contractors follow the big ones. 
An executive of a major general contractor says, "The 
productivity of construction industry is 80 percent of that of 
general manufacturing industry," because the number of companies 
with bad efficiency are not reduced while there are 530,000 
construction companies in the nation. In order to catch up with 
the super general contractors, major and semi-major general 
contractors, such as Kumagai Gumi Co., Ltd., Tobishima, Hazama, 
and Aoki Corporation, invested in real estate at home and 
abroad, constructed golf courses, or acquired a hotel chain, but 
it all ended in failure, and they are struggling to rebuild 
their management. There is a persistent rumor that "Maeda 
Construction, a company separated from Tobishima, will help 
Tobishima's reconstruction." However, Maeda's head flatly 
denied, "It is impossible for a child to swallow its parent." 
<H5>  Sense of Crisis in the Ministry of Construction </H5>
  Likewise, the super general contractors have diversified 
their business, and took contracts worth more than 2 trillion 
yen at the peak. Although the amount of contracts declined to 
1.3 - 1.4 trillion yen due to the collapse of the economy, 
Kazuhiko Kondo, managing director of Shimizu, is not 
pessimistic. "Eighty percent of our contracts are taken from 
the private sector, and 70 percent of the private-sector 
contracts are special orders which are not possible for other 
companies to handle." The situation is different from those 
local construction firms which are fully dependent on public 
works projects, and directly hit by the introduction of open 
competitive bidding system. 
  At the beginning of this year, the head of a super general 
contractor expressed a view in a magazine that, "Major 
contractors will survive while small and medium ones will go out 
of business," and was scolded by the Construction Ministry. 
While his remark was certainly inappropriate, the view prevails 
in the construction industry now that "the ministry's reaction 
to the remark was the reflection of the Construction Ministry's 
sense of crisis against the reorganization of the industry."

  [Text] It has been disclosed that Ichiro Ozawa, secretary 
general of Shinseito, in his meeting with Kazuyoshi Toyoda, 
chairman of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives (JA 
Zenchu), criticized "the food, agriculture, and farming village 
policy (new agricultural policy)." A plan to nurture 
large-scale farming is one of its pillars. At the same time, 
Ozawa explained his view that self-sufficiency in the rice 
supply should be maintained even if the people have to bear the 
consequences of the disparity between Japanese and overseas 
prices. Reportedly, Chairman Toyoda agreed with Ozawa and 
"promised to have close cooperation with Shinseito in the 
future." Since he is an influential figure in the ruling 
coalition, it seems that Ozawa's criticism of the agricultural 
policy will impact on management of future agricultural policies. 
  The meeting was held on 5 April [as published] under the 
auspices of JA Zenchu in Iwate Prefecture, where Ozawa's 
hometown is. 
  In the meeting, Ozawa touched on and criticized the new 
agricultural policy that the Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries Ministry mapped out in 1992 to nurture large-scale 
farmers. He said: "The policy will create a large landowner 
system. Large-scale farming is impossible in Japan." 
  On liberalization of Japan's rice market, Ozawa said that: 
"I was against the partial liberalization (of rice imports) 
from the beginning." In this way, he insisted that we should 
keep foreign rice out of the Japanese market by choosing 
tariffication of rice rather than accepting minimum access." 
Moreover, he explained his pet theme, saying that "rice supply 
self-sufficiency should be maintained even if the people have to 
pay five times more than (the international price) for rice." 
  In the past, the Zenchu mobilized agricultural cooperatives 
and farmers across the nation to support the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP]. It was the LDP's largest supporting body. 
Following the collapse of the 1955 regime of Japanese politics, 
however, the Zenchu reviewed its stance of supporting only the 
LDP. Prior to the Ozawa-Toyoda meeting, the Zenchu held social 
gatherings by inviting senior executives of the ruling 
coalition. The Zenchu was apparently "moving away from the 
LDP." Takami Eto, Sadanori Nakayama, and other members of the 
LDP's Agricultural and Forestry Department protested against the 
Zenchu's move. There was trouble stirring between the LDP and 
the Zenchu. 
  Contents of the meeting were scheduled to be published in 
JAPANESE AGRICULTURAL NEWSPAPER, which is the Zenchu organ. 
However, it was not realized because senior Zenchu officials had 
decided that "our ties with the LDP will definitely become worse 
if we excite the LDP more than it is now." 
  Ozawa's office printed the contents of the discussions at 
the 
meeting in newsletters and began on the seventh to distribute 
them among Ozawa's supporters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ryuzaburo Kaku, chairman of Canon Inc., by </F>
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN staffer; place and date not given; first 
paragraph is NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] The shifting of production bases overseas is 
progressing rapidly due to the appreciation of the yen, and the 
industrial circles in Japan face "the problem of hollowing out" 
of technology and employment. In the midst of this, the Keizai 
Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives] put forth a 
proposal that Japan should rethink the industrial centering on 
exports and should aim at the establishment of Japan on the 
basis of the creation of technology--a country that can 
contribute to the growth of the world through the creation of 
new technology. A NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN staffer asked Canon 
Chairman Ryuzaburo Kaku, who is also vice secretary general of 
Keizai Doyukai, about the technological policy issues and the 
management of enterprises in the future. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is the problem behind the 
proposal? 
  [Kaku] In the economy and various social aspects, Japan has 
already attained the goal set up in the Meiji era -- "Catch up 
and pass the advanced European countries and the United States." 
The export industry, which has been Japan's strong point, will 
increasingly find it difficult to maintain itself not only 
because of industrialization in Asian countries where labor 
costs are low, but also because of trade friction. In order for 
Japan to become a country acceptable to the international 
community in the future, it must contribute to it through 
science and technology. However, a glance at Japan's technology 
shows that it has nothing worth mentioning except for the 
technology of mass production. It should discontinue free 
riding in the use of basic technology of countries in Europe and 
the United States, and must immediately establish a system 
whereby it can develop new technology on its own initiative. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Have you ever felt the necessity of 
requesting the government to rethink its technological policy 
through your experience in managing Canon Inc.? 
  [Kaku] Yes, I have felt that necessity through the supply of 
our office machines to the U.S. Hewlett Packard Co. and Apple 
Computer, Inc. through OEM [original equipment manufacturing]. 
Because of the strong yen during the past year or two, the cost 
of procurement has become lower if those companies manufacture 
products by themselves within the United States or import them 
from Asian or Southeast Asian countries than if they resort to 
supply through OEM. I have strongly felt that unless Japan 
seriously undertakes the development of creative technology, it 
will have no products that can be supplied through OEM. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The proposal claims that the amount 
of 
reesearch and development investment, which is currently 0.5 
percent of the gross national product, should be increased to 2 
percent at the lowest in the next few years. Is Japan's 
investment in research and development smaller than those of the 
United States and advanced countries in Europe? 
  [Kaku] The U.S. Government's investment in research and 
development accounts for 1.1 percent of the gross national 
product and 1.0 percent each in France and Germany respectively. 
The Japanese Government has strived for the promotion of 
domestic industries through protection and various regulations, 
but it has been negligent of its technological policy. It is 
true that in the case of the United States and France, national 
defense research expenditure forms a larger proportion of the 
government expenditure, but compared with Japan, the difference 
is great nevertheless. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The total research expenditure of 
Japan, including the research expenditure of private 
enterprises, accounts for 3 percent of gross national product, 
which is higher than 2.6 percent for the United States and 2.7 
percent for Germany. It seems that Japan's private enterprises 
are active in research and development. 
  [Kaku] Japan is prominent in private research 
expenditure, but private enterprises do not conduct creative 
research. They are just following the technology for 
manufacturing epoch-making products developed by rival makers 
inside and outside Japan and are striving for research and 
development to fight successfully through the war against their 
competitors. Since each company makes an investment in the same 
technological field in a group, the efficiency of research 
investment is poor from a macro point of view, incurring a 
decline of profit rates. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is the problem of public 
administration? 
  [Kaku] Since sectarian ministries and agencies just imitate 
each other in the distribution of research budgets, concentrated 
investment in priority sectors becomes almost impossible. 
Although the cabinet has the Council for Science and Technology 
which examines comprehensive technological policies, the council 
has no authority over research budgets. It is necessary for the 
council to have research budgets, to increase its members from 
the business community, and to become the central organization 
of technological policies. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The export ratio of Canon Inc. is 
very high, amounting to 79 percent. However, Canon has also a 
pressing need to overhaul itself, does it not? 
  [Kaku] Canon has been conducting its business with "creation 
of technology" in mind for more than 10 years. It has not been 
dependent solely upon the technology of other companies, but has 
been pursuing new technology. Typical examples in recent years 
are laser beam printers and strong current liquid crystals with 
memory function. As a result, it has strengthened its 
international competitiveness and has increased its export ratio. 
  Due to the increased appreciation of the yen these days, it 
has become increasingly important for Canon to shift its base of 
operation overseas as much as possible and to manufacture high 
value-added products at home through creative technology. Canon 
has not only to protect itself from being imitated by other 
companies, but also prevent itself from being caught up in 
excessive competition. For this purpose, each company should 
supplement each other with technology each is good at and should 
strive for "symbiosis" free from excessive competition.

<F P=106> [Discussion by Yoshihiko Morozumi, former vice minister for </F>
international trade and industry and currently adviser to 
Electric Power Development Co., and Kaoru Moroi, author; place, 
date not given: "Bureaucrat-Bashing Is the Very Path to National 
Ruin!"] 
  [Text] If told to mind their own business, 
bureaucrats will lose the will to carry on. Then, who in the 
world will sustain Japan? 
  [Moroi] It seems to me that criticism of bureaucrats began 
suddenly to grow stronger after the change of government last 
summer [1993]. You are a veteran of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI], but for example, at 
MITI there was a rare incident of a minister for international 
trade and industry intervening in a vice ministerial appointment 
because of promotion of an official who was going to run for 
election. To be sure, the minister does have the power of 
appointment and dismissal, but I wonder if it would not leave a 
source of calamity for posterity if a precedent in which a 
minister actually exercised that power at will were recognized; 
but when one scans opinion in the media, it is not necessarily 
that kind of atmosphere. Behind this there probably lies the 
justifications of deregulation and administrative reform, and it 
looks to me as though there exists, by common agreement, a view 
of bureaucrats as villains, which holds that bureaucrats are the 
ones who are riding on the trend of the times. 
  I think that, basically, Japan's bureaucratic organization 
became too large. As might be expected, we probably must attempt 
to make it leaner. But at the same time, I still want to make a 
distinction between that recognition and today's trend of 
bureaucrat-bashing. 
  [Morozumi] Today there is certainly a great deal of 
criticism 
of bureaucrats. But one thing that can be said is that there is 
within that no debate on how an administrative organization or 
bureaucratic organization should function within today's 
government structure and political system. From the outset, 
there is not even a clear consensus. Some people say that 
bureaucrats should be weak, and government should be small, or, 
conversely, they say that bureaucrats need not be so 
deferential.... 
  The other day I read comments by a certain British 
industrialist in a newapaper, and he says that Japanese are 
criticizing their own political and administrative system 
because they take it for granted that U.S.-style organization 
and use of staff are good, but that each country has its own 
history and national character; therefore, it is to be expected 
that each will have a system corresponding to that, and it is 
not satisfactory to just go along with the current of the times 
and attack one's own system without any fixed principle. It does 
not mean that I go along with that argument, but it appears very 
much as though the current criticism of the bureaucracy lacks a 
philosophy or vision in that sense. 
  [Moroi] In the United States, bureaucrats are certainly 
replaced every time there is a change of administration. But 
that system works because in the United States, state 
governments exist securely, and local autonomy is firmly 
established. If in Japan we were to change top bureaucrats every 
time that ministers changed, the bureaucratic system would end 
up breaking down completely. 
<H5>  The Bureaucracy Is Japan's Line of Resistance </H5>
  [Morozumi] Of course, speaking from the constitutional setup 
of a parliament-cabinet system, ministers--and there is no 
requirement that they be Diet members--formally hold the power 
to hire and fire personnel. But in employing that power, to 
respect the spirit of personnel-neutrality, which guarantees 
neutrality of administration, up till now there has been no 
conspicuous intervention though there were informal 
consultations. That had been a tradition. 
  I am not saying that there were no former examples at all. 
But in those cases a scar was sure to remain. As a former member 
of MITI, I think the recent incident was truly deplorable and 
inexcusable. But, not in the sense of permitting politics to 
intervene in personnel matters, in the sense that an undesirable 
situation within administration was the cause of the trouble. 
  [Moroi] This is a layman's view, but I wonder if it is not a 
matter of Japan's parliament-cabinet system itself, in which 
Diet member-legislators are the chiefs of administration, are 
not functioning skillfully today. In other words, the division 
between administration and legislation has become very blurred. 
  [Morozumi] I think it has. I have been saying for some time 
that Japanese politics has become administration. The politics 
is not taking up what are by nature political matters, and 
conversely, those very detailed technical questions have become 
political matters. For example, as a question of the nation's 
basic posture, let us assume a defense problem; if the 
authorized number of Self-Defense officials changes suddenly 
because the cabinet changes, it will influence morale. To what 
extent has politics debated such things which really should be 
debated as security questions, the question of becoming a 
permanent member of the UN Security Council, and development of 
Japan-U.S. relations? I feel that a situation which can only be 
called a domestic Diet and domestic administration has continued 
for a long time. 
  [Moroi] The commentary by the Englishman mentioned earlier 
was aptly put; I suppose that the bill has come due for Japan 
having come along under the U.S. umbrella, not making any 
politically independent decisions while calling itself an 
independent nation. Now that it suddenly becomes independent 
leaving the U.S. umbrella and building a relationship of 
equality by its own ideas, Japan is literally forced to bear the 
brunt of internationalization. Both politicians and bureaucrats 
resemble inexperienced maidens. Naturally, politicians ought to 
be the ones who should take the lead at this kind of time, but 
political leadership itself has become weaker, and with that 
weak leadership, they are trying to intervene in administration. 
An outsider sees best, and the recent political situation looks 
like that to me. 
  [Morozumi] Looking at it internationally, one wonders just 
how much one can really depend on the level of Japanese 
politics, the direction of which is set by new politicians who 
made their entrance with great fanfare by riding the crest of 
some boom or other. The performance up till now has necessarily 
been satisfactory. In the final analysis it may be the fault of 
Japanese people. If that is so, who, in what manner, should 
support Japanese action that will be sufficient to make 
independent statements and independent achievements in the 
international community? To give no thought to that, and just 
bash bureaucrats because they stand out, will not solve a single 
problem. 
  For example, arguments which as if to tell bureaucrats in a 
rude manner to mind their own business are lined up in a certain 
general magazine as a special issue on the bureaucrat question. 
That is probably the trend of the times today. I think that 
bureaucrats will be happy to mind their own business if they are 
convinced that there is a reason they should do so and a 
responsibility for them to do so. However, even if the kind of 
malice or envy mentioned earlier and lots of arguments are lined 
up against bureaucrats as though turning that malice or envy 
into logic, bureaucrats will not easily accept it. 
  [Moroi] You called it the trend of the times, but rather 
than 
the true opinion of average Japanese citizen, I think that is 
something which the mass media and journalism often create. 
Journalism reported the public's distrust of politics on the 
single point of monetary influence and corruption, but in fact, 
there was annoyance over the fact that there were many 
incompetent politicians and their level kept going down with 
time. What the public now thinks about bureaucrats, in an 
unsophisticated way, is probably that there are too many of them 
and they cost too much in taxes. They do not think that 
bureaucrats are too meddlesome; rather, they feel that 
bureaucrats should stand firm. I feel that in the kind of 
climate of which you speak, it would be a national loss for 
bureaucrats to back down. 
  [Morozumi] It amounts to citing a self-serving example, but 
I, too, am worried about that. In the course of Japan-U.S. 
negotiations in all sorts of fields, including the economic 
framework talks, the U.S. side has begun criticizing Japanese 
bureaucrats severely. It is because Japanese bureaucrats do not 
obey what the U.S. side says. The resistance line which rebuffs 
the United States, even if it tries to overwhelm opposition in a 
domineering manner by unreasonable arguments, is found in 
bureaucrats. And the ones who understood that fact well were, 
for example, the former trade representative, Carla Hill. The 
United States would probably be overjoyed if the persons it 
negotiates with are replaced by politicians. 
  [Moroi] Bureaucrats resist, but after all, Japanese 
politicians back down quickly if you bluff a bit. 
  [Morozumi] How ironic it would be for officials now to mind 
their own business and for Japanese to join with the United 
States in rejoicing. 
<H5>  The Danger of "Confusion Between the Imperial Family and the </H5>
Shogunate" 
  [Moroi] But what is it like? I mean the relationship between 
politics and that kind of think-tank type official, so to speak, 
not officials who conduct business at the point of contact 
between the public and administration. Are they being used by 
politics or are they using politics? That is another area that 
I cannot see clearly. 
  [Morozumi] That is the point. It is a somewhat disconnected 
simile, but Japan is a country in which the duality of power of 
the imperial court and the Shogunate has functioned in a fairly 
skillful manner. Conversely, there is no example of a 
single-power style having operated smoothly. There are such 
examples as the military before World War II and of The General 
Council of Trade Unions of Japan after the war; however, if 
political power were to flaunt making decisions on its own 
authority as "the supreme authority of state power," Japanese 
society would indeed become a politically omnipotent social 
system as though the imperial court and the Shogunate had 
merged. But would Japanese have been able to use that kind of 
system in a skillful manner? Would it have been possible to 
elevate Japan's level as a nation by that means? 
  I think that the role of politics is bear the responsibility 
for choices. And as for administration, I think that officials 
are entities which should first, provide the options for choices 
and second, execute in a fair and neutral manner the laws which 
are decided on. But the transformation of politics into 
administration began by politicians saying that they would do 
both of those things by themselves. I do not know for sure 
whether that is Ozawa's idea, but I would like to venture to ask 
whether one can govern the country efficiently that way, and 
what its quality level would be. 
  [Moroi] Ultimately, I always end up returning to the 
post-war 
argument; under the U.S. occupation, Japan did not consider 
independently the political and administrative principles and 
philosophy set forth in the preamble of the Constitution. Japan 
has only come along until now by incorporating into the existing 
system what it was told by the occupation authorities. 
  [Morozumi] If people say that in future Japan's 
administrative functions should be taken over by politicians, 
how about Japan, too, copying the United States and making 
everyone up to police chiefs and prosecutors subject to 
election? That is probably fine for a country where an ethos by 
which even the fact that a sheriff can carry a pistol on his hip 
is because he was chosen in an election has permeated to the 
farthest reaches of the society. But that is not true of Japan. 
I cannot help but say that to bring in that kind of idea and 
suggest putting it into practice is an unrealistic argument for 
marital union between the Shogunate and the Imperial Family. 
  [Moroi] Therefore, what I would also like to ask you is that 
in the trend which is like Edo and Kyoto uniting, Diet members 
who are former bureaucrats have begun to increase greatly. One 
of the embers that ignited the incident of interference in 
promotions by the minister for international trade and industry 
was also the problem of promoting an official who was standing 
as a candidate. What will happen to the question of independence 
and neutrality of administration if the number of politicians 
who were former bureaucrats increases? Will not the distinction 
between politics and administration become more and more blurred? 
  [Morozumi] It will. Particularly if one is speaking of zoku 
[interest group] Diet members, this is without doubt an evil of 
the long reign of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], and its 
origin lies in bureaucrats having cozied up to politicians or 
political parties. That is, at the beginning they cozied up to 
politicians and curried favor with them, thinking it would be 
good for developing their own work. Then they went beyond 
currying favor, and this time came to strongly aspire to become 
politicians themselves. But in a certain sense, this can be seen 
as a counteraction in which the result of politicians' position 
having become stronger is that bureaucrats, and especially the 
younger generation, fell into losing confidence in the relative 
significance of the position of bureaucrats. In order to 
compensate for losing confidence, they themselves aspire to be 
politicians, and one cannot deny that it is charged with danger 
of confusion between the Shogunate and the Imperial Family. 
  But if we change the way we look at it, this problem 
probably 
becomes one which relates to the foundation of Japanese 
government. 
  [Moroi] Politicians who are former bureaucrats are not the 
only problem. 
  [Morozumi] You are right. One cannot say that the rapid 
increase in second-generation Diet members is without problems, 
and Diet members who are former members of labor unions and 
former members of prefectural assemblies also have their 
problems. That is, Diet members come only from such places is 
the basic problem of Japanese society, and that indeed is a 
large factor which determines the level of Japanese politics. 
  [Moroi] Therefore, it is no use to argue about unimportant 
details of the problem of bureaucrats and administration without 
debating that part in a rigorous manner. Similarly, we have 
dealt for a long time with the debate on revision of the 
election law and a law to prevent corruption, but if we are to 
carry on a substantial debate, since democracy politics does not 
operate by the power of a monarch or military power or by the 
power of a party in a Communist Party dictatorship, it is bound 
to cost money. Actually, I think it is necessary for us to pin 
down first the difficult question of to what extent it is 
acceptable to spend money. It may be that the question of Diet 
members who are former bureaucrats will also, in the end, become 
that kind of delicate debate. 
  [Morozumi] I agree. Let me say in passing, and this is also 
true of the minister in the current personnel incident, that no 
one has a side which is as cold toward bureaucrats as a Diet 
member--and it may not be limited to Diet members--who was once 
a bureaucrat. It is probably because in a certain sense they can 
be independent of bureaucrats. Diet members who are not former 
bureaucrats need help from bureaucrats; so, they cannot be cold 
toward them. 
  [Moroi] It is not unlike stories that if a committee 
chairman 
of a labor union, and a militant type at that, leaves the union 
and becomes an entrepreneur, he will carry out coercive labor 
measures in such a way as not to recognize unions, and to crush 
them if formed. 
<H5>  Can One Expect Fairness From the "Invisible Hand"? </H5>
  [Moroi] Incidentally, I also mentioned this at the 
beginning, 
but the one thing I must agree with in the chorus of criticism 
of bureaucrats is the poor efficiency, the red tape, of Japan's 
bureaucratic system. One might call it elaborate, but why did it 
become like this? 
  [Morozumi] Let me give a technical explanation. If we search 
for its roots it is probably something like this. There are many 
laws, there are many items for authorization, and there are many 
bureaucrats. That was because postwar democratic politics 
decided that every matter related to the rights and duties of 
the people must be set by law. But in practice it takes too much 
time and trouble to explain each and every item to Diet members 
and make a law. Therefore, on the economic-policy side we 
thought we would do it by persuasion and dialogue, that is, by 
point-of-contact guidance. There existed in this, to whatever 
degree, a sense that laws are a nuisance. However, if it turns 
out that, from the viewpoint of human rights, entrusting it to 
the arbitrary decisions of officials, which is termed 
point-of-contact guidance, does not guarantee rights, there is 
no choice but to return to laws. That is, it becomes 
authorization and regulation. The above is strictly a technical 
explanation. 
  I am very much in favor of reducing the items for 
authorization and criticizing red tape. But my opinion differs 
fundamentally from that of the members of today's financial 
circles in regard to the kind of criteria by which it should be 
done. They call in unison for operating by free competition and 
entrusting things to market principles. This, too, can probably 
be called the dominant trend today. Adam Smith is fine. But what 
are market principles? Its reverse side are profit principles. 
Will social fairness and national welfare really be guaranteed 
by profit principles? At least in the past, we could not trust 
the "invisible hand." It was, rather, expansion of the gap 
between rich and poor. 
  Do the Japanese public think that cheap government is better 
and that a political philosophy like that of the U.S. Republican 
Party is better? Speaking from the standpoint of working under 
the principle of a certain kind of fairness and neutrality, not 
just whether taxes are low, and judging from the inevitability 
of a time when we are moving toward a nation of aged, a welfare 
state, it is difficult to accept, even if free competition and 
market principles are presented to us as though they are symbols 
of supreme authority and we are told to mind our own business. 
  [Moroi] I agree with you on that point. Market principles in 
themselves have neither philosophy nor morality. One need only 
make a profit. Enterprises and business have, by nature, no 
such thing as ethics. That is precisely why morality is required 
in it, and administration and legislation are sought. It would 
be terrible if we really entrusted everything to market 
principles and such. If one asks what were the various kinds of 
regulations, they were not the spirit of the new constitution, 
but I suspect it was a matter of how to go on making an equal 
society, and that in order to do that, regulations which control 
market-principle-type tyranny by the strong gradually became 
necessary. It is simply incomprehensible to me that even the 
mass media, which once professed to be the guardian diety of 
equality and fairness, now forgets that and suddenly joins in 
the chorus calling for abolition of the tax system. The 
regulations and items for authorization become out-of-date over 
the course of time, and at the same time new items become 
necessary. Notwithstanding that we must abandon what is old and 
make something new, we pile new things on top of previous items; 
so, it ends up becoming red tape. Does it mean that politics 
was lazy? 
  [Morozumi] No, one cannot necessarily say that. 
Administration can scrap and build on its own, and it probably 
should. It is good to scrap regulations which should be scrapped 
by bureaucrats themselves. I am not opposed to keeping 
regulations to a minimum; I am opposing the simple philosophy 
which says that the fewer regulations there are, the better it 
is. 
  [Moroi] You remember there was a Provisional Council for the 
Promotion of Administrative Reform. It has been widely reported 
that it could not produce an ideal report because of opposition 
by bureaucrats. The problem of regulations and items to be 
authorized is one thing; if it became a matter such as 
consolidation and integration of the bureaucratic system, could 
it be done by the power of bureaucrats themselves? 
  [Morozumi] One could also be stated this way, for example. 
If 
one were to assemble several bureaucrats now and tell them to 
debate and come up with the long-term outlook for Japan's 
administrative reform according to their individual 
qualifications, a definite plan would emerge within one or two 
months. But if you told them to debate it together with one as 
representative of the Ministry of Finance, one as representative 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and one as 
representative of the Ministry of Home Affairs, it would 
absolutely not emerge. Therefore, it is not a matter of them not 
having ideas. Why can they not do it? I often wonder this 
question. To tell the truth, I do not understand what it really 
is, but I think, for one thing, the organization law of each 
ministry is causing problem. 
  The work conducted by each agency is listed in the 
organization law of each ministry. Such being the case, when a 
new problem arises, an argument is bound to develop as to which 
agencie's work it falls under. One can probably say that turf 
wars derive from the very fact that it is listed in laws. In 
short, if, for example, the content of books published by 
private-sector publishers were determined in advance by law so 
that company A published works on literature and company B 
published works related to law, there would be bound to be a 
fight over the publication of books whose content fell between 
law and literature. When all is said and done, it is the same 
thing as that. When you get to that point, it is a question of 
choice; so, probably the only way is for politics to decide. 
  When the issue of administrative organization comes up for 
discussion, questions of international cooperation, for example, 
are within the province of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
MITI, and the Ministry of Finance; therefore, there sometimes 
emerge lateral-organization views that cut across existing 
agency boundaries, such as that it would be better to make a 
Ministry of International Cooperation. I am not impressed with 
this kind of idea. The people of the country would be troubled 
before bureaucrats were troubled. If a Ministry of International 
Cooperation is acceptable, a Ministry of Social Welfare should 
also be acceptable. And, if we divided each administrative unit 
by function, it would end up becoming unclear what was what. 
Vertical division by agency is not without problems, but if we 
create a ministry for international cooperation, it is certain 
that there would develop within it departments and bureaus in 
charge of foreign affairs, trade and industry, and so on. It 
means that this kind of lateral organization would retransform 
into vertical organization. 
  [Moroi] But when I look at the Uruguay Round and so on, I 
cannot help feeling that neither the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
nor the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 
functioned in a satisfactory manner. Both were timid, and I 
cannot deny a kind of vexation just like when a fly ball falls 
between fielders who are deferring to each other. 
  [Morozumi] Concerning current diplomatic problems, there is 
a 
very strict rule called centralization of diplomacy, and because 
it cannot be removed by any means, every ministry must operate 
within its framework. 
  [Moroi] Therefore, we entrust to the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs even matters which need not be entrusted to it. It will 
not do for the trade representative to negotiate with full 
authority and have what is left be only the talk with the White 
House. 
  [Morozumi] Well, this problem has a long history that, 
before 
the war, when they created that Ministry of Greater East Asian 
Affairs, the chiefs of every bureau in the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs did their best to oppose it by submitting letters of 
resignation. There could probably be a debate over whether that 
logic is appropriate in this era of internationalization, but.... 
  [Moroi] Certainly, vertically organized administration 
probably has merits. If that is the case, I hope that 
administrators will cooperate with each other firmly by the 
leadership of politics. 
  [Morozumi] Yes. The present cabinet system also has the 
Councilors' Office on Internal Affairs and the Councilors' 
Office on External Affairs, and as organizational theory, it is 
arranged that this place is in charge of the coordination 
function. But since the power of each ministry is strong, 
coordination does not turn out satisfactorily. 
  [Moroi] Particularly when politics is weak, decisionmaking 
will end up being timid. Putting aside Kakuei Tanaka's merits 
and demerits, the biggest problem today is probably that 
politicians lack Kakuei-Tanaka type resolve. 
<H5>  Not a Public Servant, "One Who Serves the Common Good" </H5>
  [Morozumi] Certainly there exist limitations on bureaucratic 
thinking. I say this with the sense of a tribute to former Prime 
Minister Tanaka, who I served as vice minister for international 
trade and industry; his thinking was totally opposite to the 
thinking of we bureaucrats. Our thinking is bound to be 
deductive; first there is an idea, and in the development of 
that idea, we pick up individual items and fit them in. But 
former Prime Minister Tanaka's thinking was inductive. He would 
collect practical questions and create a picture before one knew 
it. It was like making a garden by bringing rocks from river 
banks here and there at random. In our case, first we draw a 
plan of the garden. We go so far as to determine the size and 
shape of the rocks and bring only those rocks that fit it. That 
is what was great about Mr. Tanaka; conversely, that is also the 
reason we bureaucrats, who have not spent our lives gaining 
practical experience, are criticized as lacking conceptual 
ability which is rooted in reality. 
  [Moroi] We are told that Kakuei Tanaka once called for 
raising teachers' salaries by 50 percent. What I would like to 
ask you about is the question of bureaucrats'compensation and 
the satisfaction in their lives. Also, according to the tone of 
the media, retiring from the bureaucracy to a good position in 
the private sector is absolutely bad. If that is so, elite 
bureaucrats retire from office too early, and it is odd why the 
media does not discuss the nature of bureaucrats' compensation 
up to the time of their retirement at the same time. The 
government agencies of Kasumigaseki usually have their lights 
burning until past midnight. In fact, a MITI bureaucrat whom I 
know told me that he rarely returns home before 0200 hours. If 
one continues that kind of life, one will surely becomes 
frustrated. After all that, if bureaucrats are told that they 
must not retire to a good position in the private sector, I am 
sure they get discouraged and no longer want to serve as 
bureaucrats. 
  [Morozumi] There are all sorts of arguments concerning 
retirement by bureaucrats to good positions in the private 
sector. I do understand, for example, the argument, developed by 
the All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, opposing 
retirement to public corporations and government enterprises 
because, looking at it from the perspective of career staff, 
someone who has just entered the organization is putting on 
airs. A large corporation has hundreds or thousands of 
subsidiaries, and therefore there is no difficulty finding other 
employment; however, there are no such opportunities in 
government agencies. If one compares things in relation to that 
one point, if bureaucrats' compensation is poor while on active 
government service, staff will not gather. 
  When I entered the Ministry of Commerce and Industry before 
the war, the minister was Nobuskuke Kishi, who was 42 years old; 
the administrative vice minister, Etsuro Shiina, was younger. 
Chiefs of all the bureaus, from the General Affairs Bureau down, 
there were even ones in their 30's. The early retirement is 
partly a hangover from that time. But today the number of years 
which an official serves has greatly increased, and for all 
practical purposes it has become lifetime work. Young staff will 
not gather unless we devise some sort of system to give them 
appropriate salaries. 
  [Moroi] I think that what is at the root of media criticism 
of bureaucrats is a "public servant" thesis. They do not come 
right out and say "you are only public servants," but I feel 
that they have a premise of looking down on bureaucrats as 
"servants." 
  [Morozumi] The translation of "public servant" [Japanese 
transliteration of the English phrase] is clumsy. If you consult 
a dictionary, it may be listed as "koboku," but the meaning is 
"one who serves the common good" because the main idea is found 
in the point that the work of bureaucrats deals not with a 
private enterprise, but with total capital, that it deals not 
with some private individuals but with the entire society. What 
is stressed is the "public," not the "serve." 
  [Moroi] What do they mean by "servant"! As in all men are 
created equal, democratic societies do not have relationships of 
superior and inferior, right? 
  [Morozumi] Bureaucrats probably do not dare to dispute being 
classified as "servants" in a democratic society. 
  [Moroi] When I think about that kind of problem, I always 
think of bureaucratic structures during the Tokugawa central 
government which included elders and junior elders. The amount 
of their stipend was, at most, 40,000 or 50,000 koku [1 
koku=5.119 bushels] of rice. They were small daimyo [feudal 
lord]. But they also had authority, and I think they had their 
own pride and high ideals. I think that the true worth of 
Japanese government offices is that bureaucrat ability and pride 
which continues uninterrupted. All sorts of things are said 
about them, but Japan's bureaucrats are excellent. 
  [Morozumi] Well, I do not say they work for the sake of the 
country, but people with old-fashioned sensibility, so to speak, 
who dislike the kind of work where one takes money into 
consideration, join up. Persons with such hidden intentions as 
using the position as a stepping stone to political circles also 
do come. But as things stand now, such excellent staff also 
gradually disperse to the private sector or other places. 
  [Moroi] Bureaucrats are not ordinary salaried staff. I think 
they have similar to such journalists as newspaper reporters, an 
aspect of being able to go on working because they have that 
kind of consciousness. 
  [Morozumi] What I said to Eiji Suzuki of the Provisional 
Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform was that I 
hope the council would please not destroy officials' will to 
work. I said that if they say there need not be a will to work, 
they should create the most efficient kind of salaried worker 
organization. But the trade-off will be that staff will not 
gather. If that happens, the level of Japan's public relations 
will probably decline. The level of Japan's administration and 
politics will probably lose international competitiveness. It 
was in that sense that I said that the problem will not be 
solved by telling bureaucrats to mind their own business. 
Since I was a bureaucrat of the prewar school, I joined the 
ministry with pride in service. And I think that the image of 
an official, image of a bureaucrat, that we inherited has been 
inherited, even after the era of the Public Service Workers' Law 
arrived after World War II, by a generation which is 
conceptually close to us. However, it has probably grown weaker. 
A generation has been born which scoffs at service without a 
fixed amount, and which returns home when the time arrives. I do 
sense a gap there. One can probably say that in that transition 
period that today's problems have arisen. 
  [Moroi] No, speaking from my own observation, leaving aside 
the question of working hours, rather in the generation of the 
bureau-chief class of many government agencies today, I sense a 
"public servant" type of timid posture. Conversely, it is in 
those one level lower, in the division-chief class, that I think 
the kind of prewar-type pride or confidence that you spoke of 
now seem to exist. That can also be sensed in MITI's recent 
trouble; if that is so, it will be another new generation gap. 
  [Morozumi] Well now, that is a very encouraging observation, 
but I am sure the times will also be critical of it.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata touched on the outlook 
for economic recovery at a 20 May House of Councilors Budget 
Committee session and said: "We would like to watch the 
economic situation carefully while hoping to see a certain, 
clear sign of recovery this fall or after." Prime Minister Hata 
indicated that the economy would be on the track for 
full-fledged recovery as early as fall. In reply to Diet 
interpellations, government officials have so far reiterated 
that "the economy is expected to be on track for full-fledged 
recovery by the end of fiscal 1994" (as stated by Yoshio 
Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning Agency). 
Prime Minister Hata's remark was the first government view that 
this fall is the goal of full-fledged economic recovery. 
  Touching on concrete measures to stimulate the sluggish 
economy, Prime Minister Hata also stated that "it is important 
to deal with" the execution of the budget "while studying the 
possibility of front-loading spending" after the Diet passes the 
budget. Moreover, he stressed the need for promotion of 
deregulation and the stability in the yen's exchange rate to the 
dollar.

<F P=106> [Article by Hajime Wada, Japan Development Bank: "New Demand </F>
for Products Through Innovation; The Need for Greater Efficacy 
in Organization and Distribution"] 
  [Text] 1. The adjustments in long-term capital 
investment are basically a reaction to the excessive expansion 
during the Heisei boom. Japan needs to establish a forward 
looking investment strategy and not wallow in needless pessimism. 
  2. We are at the point where as a whole we can finally 
forecast a bottoming out in fiscal 1994 with capital investment 
in electrical equipment leading the way cyclically and with a 
partial spilling over into other investment categories. 
  3. It will be necessary to address structural reform in 
order to sustain a recovery. To that end, it would be effective 
to create new demand for products by restructuring capital and 
businesses, by converting import categories, and by innovation. 
<H5>  The Extended Slump Is in Reaction to Rapid Expansion </H5>
  After private sector capital investment started downward in 
fiscal 1992, the decrease accelerated sharply in fiscal 1993 and 
is forecast to remain negative during fiscal 1994 as well. 
Should the decreases continue for three successive years, this 
would be the first time since the end of World War II. There are 
some who view this long-term slump in capital investment as a 
structural decrease caused by the bursting of the bubble and 
connect it to a still longer-term bottoming out; however, such a 
view is overly pessimistic. 
  Capital investment depends on forecasting business results 
and expected earnings which affect the future of private sector 
companies. If such a future is unclear, the willingness to 
invest atrophies and economic vitality is lost. In order to 
avoid excessive decreases, it will be necessary to analyze the 
reasons for the current slump in capital investment, decide on a 
recovery scenario, and then examine the conditions necessary for 
a sustained recovery. 
  The reason for the extended drop in capital spending is that 
basically there has been an unusually sharp response to the 
Heisei boom. During the Heisei boom there initially was a policy 
of low interest rates together with a growth in demand for all 
business categories: 1) the construction of office buildings 
which accompanied the centralization of finance in Tokyo; 2) an 
increase in consumer demand reflecting the advantages of the 
high yen and the efficacy of capital; 3) increased investment in 
housing accompanying the low interest rates; 4) deregulation 
(information, communications, finance, insurance, retailing, 
etc.); 5) technological innovations in microelectronics, new 
materials, and biotechnology; and 6) major construction projects. 
  However, there is a point of fundamental difference between 
the Heisei boom and preceding periods of high growth. During 
preceding periods, while industrialization in heavy chemicals 
moved forward through technological leadership, population 
shifting from the agricultural to the urban sector promoted 
investment in the urban infrastructure and created a demand for 
durable consumer goods such as symbolized by the "three sacred 
appliances [television, refrigerator, and washmachine]." The 
growth in domestic demand on a large scale was, in a manner of 
speaking, structural. 
  This kind of growth in structural domestic demand was not a 
significant element in the Heisei boom. Aside from the 
technological innovation and deregulation, such growth was 
transient. Moreover, with the focus for a time on demand growth 
in the form of full employee participation, companies confronted 
restrictions on supply and demand. In particular, in looking at 
the trends in supply and demand within the construction 
industry, we find these pressures continuing from about 1988 
through 1990, exceeding those of the construction boom which 
started in the Japanese archipelago during the 1970's. This was 
absolutely unprecedented. As evident typically in office 
buildings, we find that because construction starts lagged, 
construction already started continued even when demand 
softened, with an enormous reaction. 
  That the current slump which has dragged on this far is 
basically a reaction to the reckless expansion that took place 
during the Heisei boom. Or, to phrase it in different terms, it 
is unnecessary to be excessively pessimistic about the future. 
<H5>  There Are Signs That Electrical Equipment Will Lead the </H5>
Recovery 
  According to a survey of major company capital investment 
done by the Japan Development Bank (February 1994), signs 
pointing to a recovery were already showing up in the second 
half of fiscal 1993. Investments which will generate fresh 
demand are being made in semiconductors, liquid crystals, new 
pharmaceuticals, laser disks, and medical equipment. Among 
these, the largest capital investments are being made in 
semiconductors. 
  When we measure the differences in capital investment by 
business category over the past 10 years, one can point to 
electrical equipment, which includes semiconductors, as leading 
all other business categories in making changes. The category 
leads general machinery and chemicals by six months. The reasons 
appears to be the short three-to-four-year silicon cycle, the 
fierce domestic and foreign competition, and that the industry 
is able to make subtle changes in response to shifts in domestic 
demand. 
  We can ascertain through statistical testing (the Granger 
Test) that there is a definite correlation between investment in 
electronics equipment and investment in chemicals, general 
machinery, and precision machinery. We see this in steppers and 
inspection equipment in the general and precision machinery 
categories as well as in the gases used during the diffusion 
process to manufacture semiconductors and the epoxies supplied 
by the chemical industry. Although we could hypothesize that the 
recent trend is like past patterns, this time we also have 
liquid crystal displays, which makes the electronic equipment 
lead all the more striking. 
  In addition to these trends among major companies, a similar 
survey of leading companies done by the Japan Development Bank 
and a short-term economic survey of small and mid-sized 
companies throughout Japan done by the Bank of Japan, which 
looked at various correction patterns of the past, trends in 
land investments (a deductible category), and the movement of 
the leading indicators, estimate growth in GDP base capital 
investment fiscal year 1994. The surveys suggest that growth 
will remain negative this fiscal year but that bottom will be 
hit in the October-December quarter of calendar 1994 with an 
upturn coming in the January-March quarter of calendar 1995. 
  Looking at this fiscal year cyclically, we see a bottoming 
out of capital investment centered in part on manufacturing. 
  There is also an aspect to take note of. According to 
industry correlated tables from 1980 to 1992, electrical 
equipment had both high production superiority and high export 
competitiveness. As already discussed above, we can see the 
ripple effect of its lead on other industries, but the effect is 
not as great as it has been in the past with home electronics 
and appliances. Furthermore, in nonmanufacturing areas, which 
lagged about a year behind the manufacturing ones in reflecting 
negative earnings, there are areas that will need time to 
recover. 
  Given this, with the expected recovery limping along, the 
potential is there for it to emerge as something small in scale. 
Consequently, whether or not the recovery becomes something 
sustained will have much to do with somehow creating fresh 
demand in a variety of areas. 
  The recovery in semiconductors and liquid crystals has 
provided the United States an opportunity for a booming 
expansion by allowing it to take the lead in capital investment 
in machinery, including that revolving around Asia. With our 
domestic demand focused on multimedia, increasing development of 
innovations in information technology is definitely taking 
place. However, there is the concern that to the extent the 
recovery can provide the opportunity for exports, it will be 
tied to the high yen and the continued growth in the balance of 
payments. Therefore, even if new products are developed as in 
the past, it is clear in terms of economic scale that including 
the export market will be more effective than to restrict 
investment to the domestic market. 
  In order to extricate ourselves from the current impasse, we 
must solve the dilemma of exports. 
<H5>  The Investment Strategy Used in the Past Will Not Work </H5>
  If we analyze the balance between domestic savings and 
investment while paying heed to long-term shifts in the ratio of 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the balance of payments, we can 
see that the factor determining that shift is largely capital 
investment by private sector companies. On the other hand, if we 
look at this in terms imports versus exports, the shift in the 
balance is due to imports, not exports. 
  Consequently, if it is important to reduce the surplus in 
the 
balance of payments, then the macroeconomic strategy necessary 
to maintain Japan's corporate vitality becomes something as 
follows. To wit, it will be important to shift the balance of 
payments downward by promoting aggressive overseas development, 
production, and importation in traditional areas where we have 
lost international competitiveness. We will need to create an 
environment in which we can fully realize those areas of 
research and development, capital investment, and export, where 
we are internationally competitive. 
  Furthermore, capital investment over the mid-term will 
emerge 
through important and decisive resolution of corporate 
strategies. The business environment is transforming toward 
this. Until 1980's, networks among Japanese companies as well as 
internal company systems made possible extensive capital 
investment with minimal risk. On the other hand, with the 
macroeconomic prescription of a shift toward imports, the 
existence of this rigid system becomes an obstacle. 
  Coming into the 1990's, U.S. companies that studied Japan's 
system have pushed forward with networking among companies in 
terms of the "design in" approach (cooperation among companies 
from the design stage) and innovative manufacturing processes 
which are bearing fruit in their recent capital investment boom. 
This indicates that Japanese companies have completely lost the 
relative superiority they held in the past. 
  Given this situation, future corporate strategies in 
traditional areas will be something as follows: First, to effect 
innovations in organizational change in order to effect capital 
investment in intensive restructuring, more favorable 
distribution, and innovations of organization in order to deal 
with latent consumer and customer needs. Next, place emphasis on 
product development in order to create fresh demand, that is, to 
push forward with product innovation.

<F P=106> [By Takashi Kawada] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, 19 May -- Kim Tae-ho (age 35), former staff 
member of a DPRK (North Korean) uranium refinery plant who 
defected to the ROK on 7 May, gave an interview to YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN on 19 May. In the interview, Kim testified that North 
Korea's nuclear weapon development is "under way with active 
financial support from the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] second 
economic committee, which is under the direct control of Kim 
Il-song and Kim Chong-il, and, in 1988, North Korea succeeded in 
extracting 12 kg of plutonium." 
  Kim also disclosed that WPK Secretary Chon Pyong-ho (in 
charge of economic affairs, concurrently member of the WPK 
Politburo) is the top official in charge of the nuclear 
development project. North Korea's nuclear development has been 
hidden by a veil of mystery, and this is the first time that the 
organizational structure of the project is revealed. 
  In North Korea, Kim Tae-ho used to work at the Nuclear 
Energy 
Ministry's Namchon Chemical Plant in Pyongsan, North Hwanghae 
Province. The uranium refined at the plant is sent to a 
reprocessing plant in Yongbyon, and becomes fuel for nuclear 
reactors. In the plant, Kim worked as the leader of a working 
group, but he is quite well informed of various stories because 
he used to meet frequently with trade houses officials who 
supply foreign currencies to the plant. 
  While North Korea's nuclear development project is believed 
to be managed by the Nuclear Energy Ministry, it is actually 
under direct control of the WPK second economic committee, Kim 
said. The committee is reportedly serving as the supreme 
supervising organization of military and nuclear industries of 
the nation, and the committee's Fifth General Machinery Industry 
Bureau is in charge of the nuclear development project. All 
nuclear-related facilities in Yongbyon are administrated by the 
bureau, which is commanded by WPK Secretary Chon Pyong-ho under 
direct instructions from Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. 
  When asked about achievements of the nuclear development 
project, Kim Tae-ho said several of his friends working as 
nuclear researchers told him that "North Korea first succeeded 
in producing plutonium from spent fuel in the 5-megawatt nuclear 
reactor at Yongbyon in the summer of 1988." At that time, Kim 
Il-song and his son were reportedly so happy that they went down 
to the Yongbyon plant to give color television sets to all 
researchers and engineers. Kim added: "They extracted 12 kg of 
plutonium, and this amount was sufficient to produce two nuclear 
bombs. Taking into account North Korea's technology level, they 
may not yet have the bombs, but I believe the bombs are very 
near completion." 
  Moreover, Kim revealed a military coup was attempted early 
last year to overthrow Kim Il-song and his son. The coup 
attempt was reportedly led by Vice Marshal Kim Pong-yul and 
several generals who studied in the former Soviet Union. Dozens 
of military officials involved were all captured after their 
coup plan was blocked by Army General Political Bureau Director 
Yi Pong-won. Kim said he had heard the story from one of his 
friends -- a nephew of Yi Pong-won. 
  Kim noted: "North Korea declared a war preparation condition 
in March 1993. This was not only to cope with international 
pressures on the nation's nuclear development project, but also 
to respond to the shocking coup attempt."

<F P=106> [By Yukihiko Machida; from MAINICHI SHIMBUN 21 May Evening </F>
Edition] 
  [Text] Vienna, 20 May -- On 20 May, a councilor at the DPRK 
(North Korean) Embassy in Vienna commented on a 19 May proposal 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to send a 
delegation to North Korea in connection with the issue of 
inspecting fuel rods at a nuclear reactor in Yongbyon. The 
councilor said: "We have not yet received a reply from 
Pyongyang. However, I expect that a positive answer to the IAEA 
proposal will come." He thus disclosed North Korea's intention 
to accept the IAEA proposal. In reply to MAINICHI SHIMBUN 
questions, the councilor stressed North Korea's positive 
attitude toward accepting the IAEA delegation, and clearly said: 
"The scale of the delegation is an issue that should be decided 
by the IAEA. We have no intention of making any requests on 
that." 
  Moreover, in discussing an IAEA request for the picking of 
sample fuel rods, the councilor said: "It is clear that we are 
ready to provide basic materials to the IAEA to comply with 
safeguard obligations by accepting nuclear inspections." Thus, 
he hinted at an intention to take a flexible stance on picking 
of the samples. 
  However, regarding a 19 May IAEA request that the exchange 
of 
fuel rods be postponed, the councilor said: "I do not think 
(North Korea) will accept it." North Korea is expected to 
submit an official reply to the IAEA in a day or two.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- "The Korean people are 
not afraid of anyone's military action, but are prepared to 
counter even the U.S.-orchestrated multinational military 
action," declares a spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a statement today. 
  Pointing to the scheduled start of the Rimpac manoeuvres, he 
says: 
  "The Naval forces of the United States, Japan and the South 
Korean puppets plan to form the first unified fleet ever in 
history and stage a joint operation against fleets of other 
countries. 
  "This is a military action which must not go unnoticed in 
view of the arms buildup the United States is forcing in South 
Korea while seeking 'sanctions' against the DPRK over its 
fictitious 'nuclear issue.' 
  "The joint operation is going to be staged by a unified 
fleet 
this time while the military bosses of the United States, Japan 
and South Korea are holding aggressive confabs repeatedly 
against the DPRK, visiting each other frequently. This is a 
vivid proof that the three-way military alliance with the United 
States as the axis, which was formed long ago for stifling the 
DPRK and other Asian socialist countries, is stepping into the 
stage of practical action. 
  "We cannot but be alerted against the United States bringing 
into the open through such joint operation its intention to 
force the military action against the DPRK, come what may. 
  "The Korean people are not afraid of anyone's military 
action 
but are prepared to counter the U.S.-orchestrated multinational 
military action. 
  "The dangerous military situation created in and around the 
Korean peninsula today proves the validity and opportuneness of 
the overture of the DPRK for negotiations to establish a durable 
peace arrangement that will replace the military armistice 
machine in Korea and urgently demands its early realisation. 
  "The United States must know that it is a reasonable act 
either in view of the interests of the United States itself or 
in view of the guarantee of regional peace to respond to the 
peaceful overture of the DPRK, instead of taking adventurous 
military actions against it with the mobilisation of its 
satellites. 
  "Otherwise, the DPRK will no longer be able to discharge its 
duties under the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the United 
States must know this."

  Meanwhile, on the 19th the South Korean puppets deployed 
armed forces and large-calibre artillery groups in Inje, Paju 
and Yonchon counties adjacent to the demilitarized zone of the 
military demarcation line, and dropped commandos by formations 
of transport planes and helicopters. And they fired hundreds of 
shells and large-calibre machinegun bullets.

<F P=106> ["No Solution by Pressure" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- U.S. hardline 
conservatives are now intentionally rendering the situation 
strained with a threat of "sanctions" against the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea, while spreading the rumor that the 
replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt experimental reactor 
of the DPRK is aimed at extracting plutonium enough for the 
manufacture of four or five nuclear bombs. 
  NODONG SINMUN today views their reckless act as a mean trick 
to block a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula, lead the situation to an extreme phase, and 
find a justification of "sanctions" against the DPRK. 
  The analyst says: 
  Some forces are now charging the DPRK with "nuclear arms 
development" and "challenge to the international community" as 
regards the just refueling of a reactor in the DPRK. This is 
nothing but a sinister political plot to pursue another purpose 
by breaking up dialogue and increasing tension. 
  To solve the nuclear issue in a fair way through dialogue is 
the principled stand and consistent policy of the DPRK. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has not yet been 
resolved because the United States has put pressure on the DPRK, 
pursuing a hostile policy for stifling it. 
  If the United States had renounced such a policy and the 
third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks had been held for a package 
solution, the DPRK would have been freed from its special status 
and routine and ad hoc inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] made. And such outstanding matters as the 
preservation of selected fuel rods and sampling by the IAEA 
would have been solved automatically. 
  The U.S. hardline conservatives, however, are persistently 
intensifying pressure on the DPRK, far from seeking a fair 
solution. After all, they have only laid big obstacles to the 
solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, increased 
tension and helped munitions monopolies gain fabulous profits 
through arms sale. 
  If those speaking for the interests of the U.S. munitions 
industry create obstacles to a fair solution to the nuclear 
issue, giving precedence to short-sighted interests, it will 
bring nothing good to the United States itself. 
  The United States should ponder over the grave consequences 
to be entailed by its obstruction of a negotiated solution to 
the nuclear issue.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- An anti-U.S. joint 
meeting of youth and students in the North and South of Korea 
and abroad took place here today. 
  The meeting was addressed by Ho Chang-cho, chairman of the 
North side headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and 
Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghaknyon), and 
representatives of students and working youths. 
  Noting that the South side headquarters of Pomchonghaknyon 
proposed to the North side headquarters to hold an anti-U.S. 
joint meeting of youth and students in the North and South of 
Korea and abroad to denounce the U.S. imperialists, the chief 
culprit in the brutal Kwangju massacre, on the occasion of the 
14th anniversary of the heroic Kwangju popular uprising, the 
speakers said if the Chon Tu-hwan-No Tae-u group was the 
blood-stained blade of the sword that murdered more than 5,000 
citizens and wounded some 14,000 others in Kwangju, its hilt was 
the United States. 
  Denouncing the U.S. imperialists' persistent moves to 
isolate 
and stifle the DPRK over its fictitious "nuclear issue", they 
stressed the need for an unremitting struggle to check the U.S. 
imperialists' nuclear racket, remove the danger of nuclear war 
hanging over the nation and get the U.S. Forces and nuclear 
weapons withdrawn from South Korea. 
  They also emphasized that the South Korean youth and 
students 
should daringly wage mass struggles to overthrow the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet regime, a group of despicable 
flunkeyist-traitors, and establish a genuinely independent 
democratic government in firm solidarity with the workers, 
peasants and other sections of people. 
  They warned that the U.S. imperialists should look squarely 
at the fighting will of the South Korean youth and students and 
immediately withdraw from South Korea and that the traitor Kim 
Yong- sam should step down without delay before facing a stern 
punishment by the people. 
  A joint declaration of youth and students in the North and 
South of Korea and abroad for defending the sovereignty of the 
nation was read out at the meeting. 
  The joint declaration says the United States should stop at 
an early date its nuclear racket against the North and rice 
market and arms market opening pressure on the South and no 
longer create difficulties in the Korean people's way for 
national reunification. 
  It stresses that the South side's authorities must honestly 
repent before the whole nation of their policy of dependence on 
outside forces and flunkeyist treacheries, cancel at once their 
measure for "tough countermove" against the North and the move 
to establish an "international cooperation system" with the 
United States, Japan and other countries, and unconditionally 
stop suppressing the struggle of youth and students and other 
people in the South for independence, democracy and national 
reunification. 
  The 70 million fellow countrymen should make strenuous 
efforts for the convocation of a national conference, an arena 
for the great unity of the whole nation, transcending the 
differences in political view, religious belief, property status 
and residence, says the declaration.

  [Text] This is the just-in news. According to broadcast 
reports from Seoul, some 1,500 students belonging to the South 
Korean Federation of General Student Councils convened at Seoul 
Municipal University on 21 May and held a rally for the 
resolution of inheriting the spirit of the 18 May Kwangju 
popular resistance and opposing the United States. 
  In the meeting, the students called on the United States to 
withdraw its nuclear inspection suppression on the North. 
Denouncing the United States for imposing unreasonable pressure 
on the North for its own interests, the participants strongly 
called for the pullout of the nuclear weapons of the U.S. troops 
occupying South Korea and the suspension of the commotions of 
nuclear inspection suppression against the North. 
  After the rally, the students, in a high spirit, staged a 
street demonstration and marched toward Chongno Street in 
groups. As the students finally advanced into Chongno Street at 
around 1730, the police ran amok to stop them. However, the 
students continued a violent struggle without yielding to them. 
This has been the just-in news.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
Democratic Party repeatedly urged a thorough probe into the 
truth behind the May 18 Kwangju movement for democracy, a 
Seoul-based radio report said. 
  At the time of the Kwangju popular uprising in May, 1980, 
the 
U.S. imperialists transferred more than 70,000 puppet Army 
troops, some 150 tanks and armored vehicles and other equipment 
under their command to the military fascists to suppress the 
participants in the uprising. And the South Korean military 
fascist clique massacred over 5,000 people and wounded some 
14,000 others in ten odd days. 
  Addressing a memorial service on the 14th anniversary of the 
May 18 Kwangju democratic resistance held in Kwangju on May 18, 
the chairman of the Democratic Party urged the puppet government 
to probe the truth behind the Kwangju resistance, punish chief 
culprits in the massacre and pay adequate compensations for it.

<F P=106> ["Surveillance Violating Human Rights" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppets' intelligence and surveillance against the dissidents 
come under fire in NODONG SINMUN today. 
  It was exposed in Pusan a few days ago that the puppet 
police 
had blacklisted and kept under surveillance several dozen 
persons of dissident origin who were detained by the puppet 
authorities on "charges" of involvement in the Kwangju popular 
uprising and other movements for democracy under the former 
military dictatorial regimes and are hired at work sites after 
their release. 
  This proves that the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique continues 
resorting to the vicious intelligence and surveillance which 
were employed by the preceding military dictators as a means of 
maintaining their military fascist regimes, abandoning the 
"commitments" to "respect of human rights" and "stop to 
intelligence and surveillance", which he made when he was taking 
office. 
  This also shows that although the traitor Kim Yong-sam 
declared he reassessed the Kwangju popular uprising as "a 
movement for democracy", he still brands participants in the 
uprising as "mobs" and continuously suppresses them overtly and 
covertly. 
  The analyst points out: 
  The South Korean students and people are now calling for the 
overthrow of the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique and an immediate 
dismantling of the "Security Planning Board", "secret affairs 
command", and the puppet police, legacies of the military 
dictatorial regimes, and other fascist repressive machines. 
  Human rights violation by the "civilian regime" must be 
discontinued at once and all the repressive tools be dismantled 
unconditionally as demanded by the South Korean people. If the 
Kim Yong-sam clique persists in treacheries, ignoring the 
demands of the popular masses, it will precipitate its own 
destruction.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
[CPRF] sent an emergency telephone message to the South Korean 
puppet board of unification today denouncing the South Korean 
puppets for kidnapping lumbermen of the North working in the Far 
East of Russia. 
  The message was conveyed through the North-South Liaison 
Office at Panmunjom. 
  Recalling that the North side had warned against the 
kidnapping of North's lumbermen by the South side in the far 
east of Russia, the message said: 
  Your side kidnapped again our six citizens engaged in normal 
tree-felling in the Far East of Russia on May 18 and 20 and took 
them to Seoul. 
  Such a shameless, inhuman and barbaric act committed by your 
side against fellow countrymen even in an alien land is a 
heinous crime destroying harmonious families and increasing the 
number of families living separated on this land and a 
deliberate challenge aimed at extremely deteriorating the 
relations between the North and the South which have alreay 
reached an impasse. This has aroused irrepressible indignation 
among the entire fellow countrymen. 
  Your side's shocking crime can never be covered up with 
anything nor can it be tolerated. 
  Though your side is claiming that our lumbermen defected to 
the South, its maladroit trick is nothing but a drama the 
deceptive nature of which has already been fully revealed. 
  The authorities of your side must unconditionally and 
promptly send all the kidnapped lumbermen back to the North and 
apologize to the nation and the world for the inhuman crimes it 
perpetrated, undermining the dignity of the nation in an alien 
land. 
  If your side refuse to send them back to the North and 
continue kidnapping our lumbermen, it would entail grave 
consequences in the North-South relations as a whole and the 
South side would have to pay dearly for it. 
  Your side will be held wholly responsible for all the 
consequences to be entailed in the North-South relations and 
history and the nation will never tolerate your side's inhuman 
and anti-national crimes.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "Improper Behavior Against </F>
Reason"] 
  [Text] The president of South Korean Red Cross talks like 
a thief shouting "stop thief" by picking a quarrel with us. In 
a commemorative speech delivered on the occasion of World Red 
Cross Day, he said that the North's call for the repatriation of 
old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan -- unconverted long-term 
prisoners -- as well as the seriously ill Kim Chi-hyon to the 
northern half of the Republic is foolish, and that the North is 
responsible for preventing the exchange of visits by old parents 
between the North and South from being held, and for the lack of 
progress in the settlement of the issue of separated families. 
He also maintained that talks between the North and South Red 
Coss Societies should be resumed, insisting that the North send 
the so-called detainees, including crews of Tongjin No. 27, to 
the South. 
  Such remarks by the South Korean Red Cross president are 
inappropriate for a man of the Red Cross who should regard 
humanity as sacred and saving mankind from misfortune, as a 
basic mission. Therefore, we cannot but regard his remarks as 
unreasonable and preposterous. He even opened himself up to 
criticism with public opinion at home and abroad by making 
absurd remarks in his 22 April telephone message sent to our 
side. 
  Nevertheless, he made such remarks this time again. 
Regarding the exchange of visits by old parents and the issue 
of settling separated families, he talked as though we had 
broken a North-South agreement. This is not true. His remarks 
distorting the truth can never be understood in today's bright 
world. 
  Since an agreement was reached between the North and South 
Red Cross Societies regarding the establishment of a Panmunjom 
meeting place for separated family members and the exchange of 
visits by old parents between the North and South, the South 
Korean authorities have early on forged cunning strategies with 
the backing of gangsters of the Agency for the National Security 
Planning and have aggravated tension extremely [kuktoro] on the 
Korean peninsula by conducting powder-reeking, [hwayangnae 
nanun] large-scale war exercises against us. It is already 
well-known that they are responsible for preventing the 
above-mentioned works from being carried out. We, therefore, 
are not responsible for its failure, but instead South Korea is 
totally responsible for it. 
  Regarding our proposal for the repatriation of old men Kim 
In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who refused to convert from communism, 
and the seriously ill Kim Chi-hyon to the northern half of the 
Republic, he said that the North interprets the humanity of the 
Red Cross Society and international humanitarian law in its own 
way. However, it is the South Korean authorities who interpret 
it in their own way, running counter to the regulation on war 
and international law. 
  Article 118 of the Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 
regarding the treatment for the prisoners of war defines that 
the prisoners of war should be released and repatriated 
immediately after a hostile action ends. Therefore, old men Kim 
In-so and Ham Se-hwan should have been repatriated to the 
northern half of the Republic after the conclusion of an 
Armistice Agreement. This is an obligation of international 
law, as well as moral responsibility which South Korea should 
assume responsibility for. 
  That the South is stubbornly insisting that they are not 
prisoners is merely an unreasonable obstinacy aimed to avoid the 
criminal responsibility of unfairly detaining and suppressing 
them and to keep them in South Korea to the last. 
  So is the issue of nationality obtained by old men Kim In-so 
and Ham Se-hwan. Under the condition that South Korean 
authorities did not return them but kept them under detention, 
they had to do so to live on. If they had wished to live in 
South Korea, why would they ask the International Committee of 
the Red Cross to help them be repatriated to the North? 
  The South Korean Red Cross is charging old men Kim In-so and 
Ham Se-hwan with violating the National Security Law, which is 
being strongly denounced and refuted by the international 
community, and pin unreasonable crimes on them by labeling them 
with so-called activities and operations to trample the 
government. This is indeed an unfair treatment ignoring the 
international law on war and postwar measures and interpreting 
it at its convenience. 
  The demand regarding the crew of the Tongjin No. 27 is also 
unreasonable babblings. The Tongjin No. 27, which had 
infiltrated deep into our side's territorial water in the West 
Sea, was thoroughly a spy boat. The head fisherman and captain 
on board confessed that it was a spy boat. The crew on board 
cursed the South Korean authorities who used them for espionage 
and said they would never return to South Korea. 
  We never promised anyone that we would return the boat and 
that could never have happened. The president of the South 
Korean Red Cross said the detainees should be returned but there 
are none in our Republic. What we have are defectors who chose 
our social system according to their own faith and who came with 
their longing for the northern half of the Republic. 
  It is the meanest act without any human moral or conscience 
to keep finding fault with us reversing black and white despite 
the facts. 
  Today, the acting chairman of the Central Committee of the 
DPRK Red Cross Society, in a telephone message sent to the South 
Korean Red Cross, once again strongly urged the South side's Red 
Cross to immediately return old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, 
and Kim Chi-yon in conformity with international law. 
  The South Korean Red Cross should stop trying to keep old 
men 
Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, and Kim Chi-yon, daughter of 
unconverted prisoner Kim Pyong-chu, under detention while 
playing servant to the South Korean authorities, but take steps 
to immediately return them to the northern half of the Republic 
according to their own demand and fair public opinion. This is 
the duty of the Red Cross. 
  If the South Korean Red Cross continues to refuse to return 
them and use them for insidious political purposes, it will be 
more condemned by the international community.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The delegation of the 
American Committee on Korea led by its Executive Director John 
M. Swomley left here today after concluding its 12-day visit to 
Korea. 
  During its stay in Korea, the delegation visited 
Mangyongdae, 
the Tower of the Chuche Idea, the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital, 
the monument to the victorious fatherland liberation war, 
Panmunjom and other places. 
  After visiting Mangyongdae, the head of the delegation said 
he thought a lot, noting that President Kim Il-song who was born 
into a poor family is a people's leader. 
  Witnessing the concrete wall built by the U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets in the area south of the Military 
Demarcation Line, he stressed that the United States must pull 
its forces and nuclear weapons out of South Korea.

<F P=106> ["South Korean People's Cause of Independence, Democracy and </F>
National Reunification Is Invincible" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The people's struggle 
for independence, democracy and national reunification is going 
on unremittingly in South Korea in spite of brutal suppression 
and despicable intrigues by the fascist clique, and their desire 
will surely be realized, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined 
article today. 
  The article charges that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique 
under 
the patronage of the U.S. imperialists are intensifying fascist 
suppression of the South Korean students and other sections of 
people who rose in struggle, while resorting to wicked intrigues 
to disorganize their movement from within through its 
reformation. 
  The article reads in part: 
  The puppet clique are, above all, trying to decompose the 
fundamental nature of the South Korean people's movement as one 
for independence, democracy and national reunification. 
  They let their stooges, venal scholars and pseudo activists 
argue that there is no need to put up the slogan of 
independence, democracy and national reunification in the South 
Korean people's movement vociferating about the "change of the 
times", and even contend that there cannot and should not be a 
fight under the "civilian" regime. 
  Their argument that the slogan of independence, democracy 
and 
national reunification should not be put up in the South Korean 
people's movement is, in essence, an extremely wicked and 
cunning trick to deny and decompose the fundamental character of 
the movement as one for anti-U.S. independence, anti-fascist 
democracy and national reunification and to cut off the lifeline 
of the movement boasting of scores of years of their unremitting 
struggle. 
  The South Korean puppet clique also preach compromise with 
the "civilian" regime, not head-on confrontation with it or a 
fight for its overthrow. 
  Their talk that the Kim Yong-sam regime should not be 
overthrown, but a compromise should be made with it, is, in the 
final analysis, as good as saying the people should continue to 
meekly obey the U.S. imperialists' colonial domination, not 
complain about dictatorship and fascism and keep mum about 
whatever they do against national reunification. 
  They preach "petition" and "nonviolence", encouraging 
"dialogue" and "compromise", but it is a nonsensical talk under 
such fascist system as that of South Korea where suppression is 
going unhindered. 
  Their preach is an artifice to lull the anti-Kim Yong-sam 
sentiments of the South Korean people, keep them from rising in 
fierce struggles and, furthermore, to totally disarm their 
movement and make them submit to the principle of non-resistance 
and capitulationism. 
  The article stresses: 
  The South Korean people's desire cannot be realized so long 
as such sycophant traitors, fascist dictators as Kim Yong-sam 
are left alone. 
  The South Korean people, therefore, should kindle fiercer 
flames of struggle to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime 
and establish a genuinely independent democratic regime.

<F P=106> ["Hypocrite Unmasked" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The recently exposed 
concealment of 70 kilograms of undeclared pure-powder plutonium 
in Japan has brought into a glaring light the true color of 
Japan as a hypocrite trying to deliberately fool the world, 
while producing and stockpiling a large quantity of plutonium, 
says MINJU CHOSON today. 
  The analyst continues: 
  The Japanese reactionaries, captive to the desire to convert 
Japan into a nuclear power, have promoted the introduction, 
deployment and stockpile of nuclear weapons behind the spurious 
curtain of "three non-nuclear principles." They are now stepping 
up nuclear armament, raising a hue and cry over "the nuclear 
suspicion" against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and 
its "nuclear issue." 
  It was the first time that undeclared plutonium was 
discovered in Japan. But nobody can tell how much plutonium is 
concealed in Japan. 
  The recently exposed concealment of plutonium makes us cast 
doubt on the impartiality of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency in its inspections. 
  The IAEA arbitrarily branded the fledgling peaceful nuclear 
activities of such small countries as ours as "nuclear 
development", while conniving at the dangerous nuclear 
activities of Japan. This is obviously an undisguised 
application of a double standard. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must stop the despicable nuclear 
gamble, open to the public the quantity of the concealed 
plutonium and behave themselves. 
  The United States and the IAEA would be well advised to pay 
due attention to Japan's nuclear armament, adhering to the 
principle of impartiality.

<F P=106> ["Japan in the Dock as Nuclear Criminal" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- The recent discovery of 
a large quantity of nuclear material in Japan evidently shows 
once again that her design for nuclear armament has gone to 
extremes, notes NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The Japanese reactionaries invented a "nuclear suspicion" 
about the DPRK and have acted as if they were a "nuclear judge". 
Expressing dissatisfaction at the adequate inspections of the 
DPRK, they have resorted to pressure demanding a "special 
inspection", an "additional inspection" and kicked up a row in 
an effort to make the United Nations impose "sanctions" on the 
DPRK. 
  They even prepared an "emergency legislative arrangement" 
for 
a dispatch of their "self-defence forces" to the Korean 
peninsula, talking about "response" in case the UN should adopt 
a resolution on "sanctions". 
  The recent discovery of plutonium kept in hiding made it all 
the clearer why Japan has been so hell bent on false propaganda 
about "nuclear suspicion" on the DPRK. 
  It is, indeed, a mean intrigue that Japan has engaged in 
hostile acts against the DPRK, spreading a groundless lie to 
brand it as a nuclear criminal, while keeping a large quantity 
of nuclear weapons- grade material in hiding. 
  Japan, a nuclear criminal, has tried desperately to place 
others in the dock as a nuclear criminal, but she herself has to 
sit in it. 
  Japan must stop at once her intrigues to do harm to the DPRK 
over the "nuclear issue", clearly declare to the international 
community the total amount of plutonium concealed nationwide and 
give up her nuclear armament.

<F P=106> ["`Important Lesson From Struggle for the Cause of </F>
Socialism'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- Papers here Friday 
carried "Important Lesson From Struggle for the Cause of 
Socialism", an article by Mikhail Zemskov, chief editor of the 
Russian paper PATRIOT. 
  In the article the author wrote that the reality in which 
socialism has suffered a setback and capitalism revived in some 
countries in recent years gave the serious lesson that of 
paramount importance in smashing challenges of the imperialist 
allied forces and steadily advancing the cause of socialism is 
to correctly solve the question of succeeding to the 
revolutionary cause, the question of succeeding to leadership. 
  Stating that he has read many famous works of Comrade Kim 
Chong- il including "The Historical Lesson in Building Socialism 
and the General Line of Our Party", "On the Fundamentals of 
Revolutionary Party Building" and "Abuses of Socialism Are 
Intolerable" and visited Korea on several occasions and made a 
deep analysis of the reality, he said he deeply realized in this 
course that the question of succeeding to leadership is not only 
the basic factor of the advance of the socialist cause in Korea 
but the main point decisive of the rise or fall of the 
international communist movement. 
  The socialist cause, the revolutionary cause of chuche which 
was started and has been developed by Comrade Kim Il-song is 
being successfully carried forward by the heir to him, Comrade 
Kim Chong-il, to accomplishment, the author wrote, and went on: 
  Characteristic of the leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il for 
carrying forward the cause of socialism to accomplishment is 
that he is accelerating the cause of socialism at faster pace 
not only by defending and succeeding to the outstanding 
ideological and theoretical activities and immortal exploits of 
Comrade Kim Il-song but also by developing and enriching them in 
conformity with the requirements of the development of the times 
and with the aspirations of the people. 
  In carrying forward the cause of socialism, the 
revolutionary 
cause of chuche, to accomplishment Comrade Kim Chong-il has 
effected new innovations in the revolution and construction as a 
whole, always set bold goals and attained them successfully. As 
a result, fundamental changes have taken place in all fields 
including the party and state affairs, economic and cultural 
construction and the building of revolutionary Armed Forces. 
  The expansion in scope and development of the cause of 
socialism, the revolutionary cause of chuche pioneered by 
Comrade Kim Il-song in the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, fully show the great personality of Comrade Kim Chong-il 
as an outstanding and tested leader. 
  What I must stress in particular among the victories and 
successes made by Comrade Kim Chong-il in carrying forward and 
developing the cause of socialism is the singlehearted unity of 
the leader, the party and the masses. 
  In Korea today the whole party, the entire Army and all the 
people are unfailingly loyal to their leader, devotedly 
upholding his cause and firmly united ideologically and 
purposefully and In- moral obligations. 
  All the people regard Comrade Kim Chong-il, an illustrious 
leader, as their father and are united behind him in one mind. 
Herein lie the source of the invincibility and durability of the 
Korean-style socialism. 
  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is 
shattering to pieces the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves of the 
imperialists, defending the security of the country and the 
dignity of the nation and safeguarding and developing the 
socialist system with its invincible revolutionary Armed Forces 
and with the might of singlehearted unity. 
  Conclusions drawn from the present realities of the DPRK, 
now 
a socialist bastion, and of the international communist movement 
which is undergoing ordeals in face of all challenges bespeak 
that the cause of socialism will be firmly defended and 
accomplished if leadership over the revolution and construction 
is carried forward by an outstanding leader, but, otherwise it 
will play into the hands of the renegades of socialism and end 
in failure. 
  The DPRK where the question of succeeding to leadership has 
been solved successfully by Comrade Kim Chong-il, a genuine 
people's leader, serves as a model of world socialism, as a 
beacon of hope for the people who are fighting for socialism and 
communism. 
  Political and public figures and progressive people of many 
countries in the world look up to and revere Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, the dear leader of the Korean people, as the 
outstanding leader of the present times and are rising in the 
struggle to defend and develop the cause of socialism. 
  Socialism, the ideal and aspiration of mankind, is sure to 
be 
crowned with victory.

<F P=106> ["United States, Violator of Korean Armistice Agreement" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- Foreign public and press 
circles denounced the criminal act of the U.S. imperialists who 
have turned the Korean peninsula into a dangerous area of a 
nuclear war. 
  The Libyan paper AL JAHAF AL AHDAR in a commentary said that 
the United States deployed its military bases in South Korea 
under the pretext of "protecting" South Korea from "communist 
threat" right after World War II. 
  The United States has divided Korea into the North and the 
South recording another stained chapter in its history, it said. 
  The Vietnamese paper NHAN DAN in an article entitled "South 
Korea, Largest U.S. Nuclear Base in Far East" exposed that the 
United States built more than 200 military establishments and 40 
big military bases in South Korea and deployed there nuclear 
weapons amounting to 55 percent of those in the Asia-Pacific. 
  The Cuban news agency PRENSA LATINA reported that Washington 
has kept some 40,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and 
deployed over 1,000 nuclear weapons including Lance, Hawk and 
Honest John missiles. The agency noted the recent deployment of 
formations of new-type tactical helicopters and "Patriot" 
missiles is a new strategy of the United States of arms buildup 
in South Korea. 
  The Indian paper DELHI SAMACHAR said that the U.S. 
imperialists shipped nuclear weapons into South Korea, regarding 
it as a bridgehead and a nuclear forward base for aggression on 
Asia and domination over the world. 
  Govind Narain Srivastava, secretary general of the Asian 
Regional Institute of the Chuche Idea, said that despite of the 
unanimous denunciation of the Korean people and the world 
public, the United States introduced "Patriot" new-type missiles 
into South Korea and planned to resume the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises, a nuclear war gamble. 
  The United States has systematically violated articles of 
the 
Korean Armistice Agreement for 40 years in the past contrary to 
its duty as a signatory to the agreement, he noted.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The Workers' Party of 
Korea publishing house brought out the volume 10 of "Kim Il-song 
Selected Works", an encyclopedia of the chuche idea which 
carries famous works of the great leader President Kim Il-song 
in chronological order. 
  The volume contains 33 famous works of those published by 
the 
great leader from January 1987 to December 1992. 
  It comprehensively consummates the outstanding ideas, 
theories and policies of the great leader on further 
accelerating the building of socialism and communism and 
successfully achieving the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country and the cause of global 
independence, under the uplifted revolutionary banner of the 
chuche idea to meet the requirements of the developing reality 
in which the cause of modelling the whole society on the chuche 
idea has been propelled, and the precious achievements and 
experiences gained in the struggle for their realisation. 
  Consummated there are the unique ideas, theories and 
policies 
giving answers to the theoretical and practical questions

including the question of effecting a new turn in science, 
education, public health and socialist culture and the question 
of further strengthening and developing the People's Army.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il recently bestowed again a benevolent solicitude 
upon the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital. 
  He sent large quantities of baby's clothes of various styles 
for boys and girls, precious pharmaceuticals needed for the 
manufacture of medicines and articles to be used in ensuring 
medical services on a higher level.

Maternity Hospital, he had sent more than seven tons of wild 
honey and over ten tons of unshelled pine nuts on three 
occasions this year alone. 
  The hospital completed in March, 1980, is a comprehensive 
medical service base appointed with latest equipment, which was 
built for women and children on the initiative and according to 
a plan of Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The total floor space of the hospital is over 60,000 square 
metres. 
  The hospital has a total of 1,500 beds, of which 600 beds

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Noble Traits of Korean People Sharing </F>
Same Destiny With the Party" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- In Korea today the 
leader and the people form an integrated whole, and the Korean 
revolution is advancing triumphantly under whatever storm and 
stress because the entire people uphold the party and the leader 
with loyalty and share the same destiny with the party, says 
NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The daily comes out with a by-lined article entitled 
"Sharing 
the Same Destiny With the Party Is Noble Traits of Our People" 
on the lapse of 30 years since the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il assumed leadership over the party affairs. 
  It quotes Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: 
  "The dignified life and honour of a revolutionary lie in 
sharing the same destiny with the party and dying at his post of 
duty while fighting it out for the sake of the revolution." 
  Noting that the imperialists have left no stone unturned in 
a 
bid to isolate and stifle the Korean-style socialism, the life 
and soul of the Korean people, the article says: 
  Under such circumstances our people repose unquestioned 
trust 
in Comrade Kim Chong-il and are defending him and firmly 
resolved to fight with fortitude along the road indicated by the 
party, entrusting their destinies to the party and the leader, 
no matter what the others say. 
  The noble ideological and spiritual world of the Korean 
people determined to share the same destiny with the party finds 
clear manifestation in the fact that they firmly believe in and 
follow their illustrious leader as the defender of their 
destinies, as their mental support and are vigorously struggling 
with an unshakable determination to defend him politically and 
ideologically and with their lives. 
  In Korea today all the people firmly believe in and follow 
Comrade Kim Chong-il as the defender of their destinies. 
  It is because the unshakable will to firmly believe in and 
follow our general had settled in their hearts that corporal Kim 
Chol-chin and Private 1st Class Kim Kyong-chol of the Korean 
People's Security Forces could fight in defence of their honour 
as revolutionary soldiers under the difficult circumstances in 
which they happened to be drifted overboard to the 
enemy-controlled area. 
  The Korean people's unquestioned worship of the dear leader 
is so strong and invariable as they cherish through their life 
experience the greatness of his ideas, leadership ability and 
personality. 
  A countless number of revolutionary soldiers becoming a fort 
and shield to firmly defend Comrade Kim Chong-il in any storm 
and stress and unhesitatingly laying down even their youth and 
lives on this road have been witnessed among the Korean people. 
Among them are revolutionary soldiers who plunged themselves 
without hesitation into a raging fire to carry away portraits of 
their leaders to a safe place, and heroic soldiers who laid down 
their precious youthful lives by covering handgrenades on the 
point of explosion with their bodies. 
  The noble ideological and spiritual world of the Korean 
people determined to share the same destiny with the party also 
is clearly expressed in that they are doing their utmost to 
repay the deep benevolence of their leader who has brought their 
own destinies into full bloom. 
  Noble traits are being displayed highly among our people; 
they volunteer into grand socialist construction sites, coal and 
ore mines and rural villages in groups, not seeking any fame or 
reward, in order to carry the intentions and plans of the party 
into effect; they faithfully perform their duties at their posts 
till the last moments of their lives. 
  This clearly shows the noble spiritual world of the Korean 
people determined to silently devote their whole lives to the 
struggle for implementing the ideas and policies of their leader 
with one mind.

<F P=106> ["Reactionary Nature of Bourgeois Humanitarianism" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries an article contributed by Dr. Choe Chol-ung exposing the 
reactionary nature of bourgeois humanitarianism loudly 
advertised by the imperialists and the reactionaries of history. 
  Noting that humanitarianism assumes the class nature in 
every 
respect, the article says: 
  Bourgeois humanitarianism is the world outlook reflecting 
the 
demand and interests of the capitalist class. The unscientific 
and reactionary nature of the bourgeois humanitarianism lies in 
that it is based on a wrong viewpoint that regards social human 
beings as individual biological beings that exist, dominated by 
nature, adapting themselves to the circumstances according to 
the instinct of animals, by bringing the social human beings 
down to the level of wild animals. 
  The reactionary nature of bourgeois humanitarianism is 
clearly manifested, first of all, in its deceptive preaching of 
"philanthropy" and "humanity." 
  It is the universal law governing the capitalist society 
that 
the stronger swallows up the weaker. Humanity and philanthropy 
are unthinkable in the capitalist society where exploitation and 
oppression prevail. 
  Love and sympathy cannot be expected between the present-day 
wage slave-owners who abandon themselves to pleasure by 
overdriving the workers and the wage slave workers who have 
everything trampled down under harsh oppression and exploitation. 
  The reactionary nature is also concentrically revealed in 
hypocritical preaching of "human rights" and "freedom." 
  In the capitalist society based on selfishness, the 
principle 
"human beings are wolves toward human beings" prevails in human 
relations. Therefore, the society is replete with falsity, 
hypocrisy, swindle, fraud, antagonism, jealousy, plot and enmity 
which are fundamentally contrary to humanity. 
  The popular masses cannot enjoy genuine freedom and rights 
in 
that society where it is the universal phenomenon to antagonize 
each other and sacrifice others for one's own ease and pleasure. 
  Genuine humanitarianism can never be actualized in the 
capitalist society where human conscience, justice and all other 
human things are ruthlessly violated by money. 
  The falsity of "humanitarianism" advertized by the 
imperialists and the reactionaries is proved by the reality of 
capitalism. 
  In the capitalist society where a handful of capitalist 
class 
monopolizes everything including the state power and means of 
production, the working people are excluded from the rights to 
the exercise of sovereignty and the socio-political activities. 
Worse still, they are denied the rights to working, food, 
clothing, housing, medical treatment and learning. 
  The situation is pretty much the same in those countries 
where socialism has collapsed and capitalism revived. The 
collapse of socialism has brought to the people an 
inhumanitarian society, capitalism where exploitation, 
oppression and social inequalities prevail and the human nature 
is trampled underfoot, not a "humanitarian and democratic 
society." 
  The humanitarian idea can never be realised in the 
capitalist 
society where class oppression and confrontation constitute the 
mainstay of social relations.

  [Text] Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army [KPA] 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, the dear leader of our party and people,

supreme commander to the officers and men of the KPA unit to 
which Comrade Pak Yong-ho belongs for making a contribution to 
building, preserving, and managing the revolutionary site. He 
has also extended thanks to the men of merits in Hoeryong city. 
  Taking the work of building, preserving, and managing the 
revolutionary site associated with the glorious and brilliant 
revolutionary history and the immortal revolutionary feats of 
the party and the leader as their due responsibility as the 
leader's army and the party's army, the officers and men of the 
KPA unit to which Comrade Pak Yong-ho belongs participated in 
this work as a group. They have intensified the indoctrination 
work on the revolutionary tradition through their visit to the 
site. In addition, using their leisure time between trainings, 
they made a great contribution to preserving the revolutionary 
site to its original state handing it down for ages to come. 
  Taking the pride and dignity in living in a place with a 
historic background, some 80 men of merits, including Yu 
Tae-kyu, in Hoeryong city resolved to take part in managing the 
revolutionary site in the city in February 1991. Since then, 
they have carried out the management befitting masters. The

set up new audio system around the site, but also prepared 
numerous materials and equipment necessary for the construction 
of the site and took part in the work of introducing the 
revolutionary site. 
  Meetings to deliver KPA Supreme Commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's thanks were held at relevant sectors. Functionaries 
concerned, the soldiers of the People's Army, and the men of 
merits were present in the meetings. 
  In the meetings, the comrade supreme commander's thanks were 
delivered amid the participants' fervent applause. Discussions 
for resolution were held at the meetings. 
  A letter of pledge and a resolution to KPA Supreme Commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il were adopted in the meetings.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- Many calcium silicate 
brick houses are under construction in Korea. 
  In recent years alone, more than 400 rural villages of 
calcium silicate brick houses have made their appearance in some 
120 cities, counties and ri. Dwelling houses for more than 
35,000 families have been built in these villages. 
  Houses of this type are very convenient for rural life. Each 
flat has a floor space of 90 to 120 square metres. 
  Cooking and heating are done by methane gas at the dwelling 
houses in many rural villages including Yongjin-ri, Kaechon City. 
  The construction of calcium silicate brick houses in Korea 
began at the end of the 1980s. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, always paying deep 
attention to the betterment of the people's living, saw to it 
that calcium silicate brick production bases were built in Anju, 
Pihyon and Hamhung to more satisfactorily meet the increasing 
needs for dwelling houses, and wisely led their construction. 
Thus, the construction of calcium silicate brick factories with 
a total production capacity of 1,000 million bricks was 
completed successfully in two years. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il saw designs of calcium silicate brick 
houses in May, 1986. Saying it was the wish of the great leader 
President Kim Il-song and his own determination to enable all 
the people to live in such good houses, he stressed that such 
houses should be built on an extensive basis in Pyongyang and 
local cities and rural villages. 
  As a result, peculiar dwelling houses have appeared in 
Pyongyang and provincial, city and county seats and rural 
villages.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 20 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S. 
officials met for the second straight day Friday [20 May] but 
still came up short of a deal to jump-start stalled trade talks 
on ways to increase foreign access to key Japanese markets. 
  The two sides agreed to make another try Saturday. 
  "There has been progress in mutual understanding," said a 
Japanese official involved in the negotiations. 
  The negotiations, which lasted five hours Friday, were aimed 
at breaking a three-month deadlock in the so-called "framework" 
talks that has badly strained bilateral trade ties. 
  While officials declined to comment on what transpired 
across 
the negotiating table, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
underscored the importance of the meeting by personally 
attending part of the "exploratory talks" between subcabinet 
officials. 
  Representing the Japanese team were Vice Minister of 
International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu and Deputy 
Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi. 
  The U.S. delegation consisted of two principal Japan trade 
negotiators, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene 
Barshefsky and Presidential National Economic Council Deputy 
Director Bowman Cutter. 
  Like their Japanese counterparts, U.S. officials involved in 
the talks were equally tight-lipped. 
  "You know I can't talk," said a U.S. official when asked for 
comment. 
  Cutter, however, sought to project an air of conviviality 
after emerging from the morning session. 
  "We had a good and cordial conversation, and we will meet 
again," Cutter told reporters. 
  The trade talks, which are closely watched on financial 
markets as a barometer in the state of relationship between the 
world's two largest economies, ruptured in February at a meeting 
in Washington between President Bill Clinton and then Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who succeeded Hosokawa in late 
April, and Clinton agreed last week to work out a common "basis" 
for restarting the framework talks before they meet at the group 
seven summit in Naples in early July. 
  One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the 
primary cause for the rupture of the negotiations at the Feb. 11 
U.S.-Japan summit -- is the idea of setting "objective criteria" 
to measure imports to Japan. 
  In what is known as a "results-oriented" approach, the U.S. 
has insisted on using "numerical indicators" to ensure that a 
trade agreement with Japan translates into increased foreign 
sales in the Japanese market. 
  Tokyo has vehemently objected to the idea, saying it amounts 
to government-managed trade. 
  Among the industry sectors covered under the "framework" 
accord are Japanese Government procurement for medical and 
telecommunications products, trade in autos and auto parts and 
the Japanese insurance market. 
  The U.S. wants Japan to open its market wider to foreign 
goods and stimulate domestic demand in order to reduce its vast, 
and growing, trade surplus. 
  The U.S.-Japan trade imbalance was underscored by fresh U.S. 
Government data Thursday that showed the U.S. trade deficit with 
Japan jumped 25 percent in March to 5.80 billion dollars. 
  The U.S. trade gap with Japan came to 15.04 billion dollars 
in the first three months of this year, well ahead of the 
comparable period last year which stood at 13.3 billion dollars.

  [Text] Washington, May 21 KYODO -- Japan and the United 
States held a third day of trade talks Saturday [21 May] as 
officials raced to find a mutually acceptable formula to 
increase market penetration in Japan for several U.S.-interested 
industry sectors. 
  "Both sides felt that it would be important to meet this 
afternoon to further clarify and address the issues on the 
table," said a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor. 
  At stake is the prospect of the so-called "framework" trade 
talks, which ruptured in February and have since badly soured 
bilateral trade relations. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton have said they are eager to find a common "basis" for 
resuming the framework talks when they meet at the Group of 
Seven summit in Naples in early July. 
  But the prospects of an early agreement remained elusive 
after three days of on-and-off negotiations. 
  When the officials emerged from another hourlong 
face-to-face 
encounter Saturday afternoon, they refused to say whether there 
was progress in their latest round of talks. 
  "I can only say the talks are ongoing," said Japan's Deputy 
Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi. 
  Japanese officials said the two sides will meet again 
Monday. 
  Saturday's session was a surprise. 
  Both the Japanese embassy and Kantor's office told reporters 
earlier Saturday that the two sides have called off the day's 
session. 
  "The Americans later called us up and told us they need 
certain clarifications," a Japanese official said later in 
explaining why the two sides decided to hold a meeting Saturday. 
  While both Japanese and U.S. officials have declined to 
comment on what transpired across the negotiating table, Kantor 
underscored the importance Washington attaches to this week's 
talks by personally participating in part of the negotiations 
between sub- cabinet officials. 
  The trade talks, which are closely watched on financial 
markets as a barometer in the state of relationship between the 
world's two largest economies, broke down at the Feb. 11 meeting 
in Washington between Clinton and then Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. 
  One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the 
primary cause for the three-month deadlock in the negotiations 
-- is the idea of setting "objective criteria" to measure 
imports to Japan. 
  In what is known as a "results-oriented" approach, the U.S. 
has insisted on using "numerical indicators" to ensure that a 
trade agreement with Japan translates into increased foreign 
sales in the Japanese market. 
  Tokyo has vehemently objected to the idea, saying it amounts 
to government-managed trade. 
  Among the industry sectors covered under the framework 
accord 
concluded last July are Japanese Government procurement for 
medical and telecommunications products, trade in autos and auto 
parts, and Japanese insurance market. 
  The U.S. wants Japan to open its market wider in these 
"priority" market areas and stimulate domestic demands in order 
to reduce its vast and growing trade surplus. 
  The U.S.-Japan trade imbalance was underscored by fresh U.S. 
Government data Thursday that showed the U.S. trade deficit with 
Japan jumped 25 percent in March to 5.8 billion dollars. 
  The U.S. trade gap with Japan came to 15 billion dollars in 
the first three months this year, well ahead of the comparable 
period last year which stood at 13.3 billion dollars.

  [Text] Tokyo, may 23 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
are "at a delicate stage" in their bid to reopen stalemated 
"framework" trade talks, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai 
said Monday [23 May]. 
  "We are vigorously trying to break an impasse in the 
negotiations," the top government spokesman told a news 
conference after Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata met with senior 
government officials Monday morning on the protracted trade 
talks. 
  Kumagai, trade minister in the last government, refused to 
comment further on the ongoing efforts to resume the talks for 
setting up a new framework for bilateral trade. 
  Japan and the U.S. have held three rounds of exploratory 
talks to weigh terms and conditions for resuming the 
negotiations under the framework agreement concluded last July. 
  The trade talks, which are aimed at widening foreign access 
to the Japanese market and paring down Japan's vast trade 
surplus, broke down in February after Tokyo rejected 
Washington-proposed yardsticks to gauge progress in Japanese 
imports. 
  Among the industry sectors covered under the framework 
accord 
are Japanese Government procurement of medical and 
telecommunications equipment, trade in autos and auto parts, and 
the Japanese insurance market. 
  The U.S. wants Japan to open its market wider in these 
"priority" areas and stimulate domestic demand to reduce its 
trade surplus. 
  The trade imbalance was underscored by fresh U.S. Government 
data released last week showing the U.S. trade deficit with 
Japan leaped 25 percent in March to 5.8 billion dollars. 
  The trade gap came to 15 billion dollars in the first three 
months of this year, well ahead of the same period last year, 
when the figure stood at 13.3 billion dollars. 
  Meanwhile, Finance Ministry officials said the ministry has 
dispatched Eisuke Sakakibara, vice chief of its international 
finance bureau, to washington to help with talks aimed at 
resuming the framework dialogue. He is in charge of 
negotiations on the insurance market. 
  Unofficial vice ministerial-level talks to unblock the trade 
stalemate are under way in Washington, but no senior 
high-ranking officials from the Finance Ministry have attended 
the talks so far.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
both want to agree during ongoing informal talks in Washington 
to resume the stalled bilateral trade framework talks, Vice 
Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito said Monday [23 May]. 
  Saito told a news conference it is clear the two sides want 
to reach agreement on the resumption during the unofficial vice- 
ministerial talks to be held again Monday and that he hopes 
Tokyo and Washington would make efforts to achieve that. 
  Japan and the U.S. have held three rounds of exploratory 
talks since last week to weigh terms and conditions for resuming 
the negotiations under the so-called "framework" agreement 
concluded last July. 
  The trade talks, which are aimed at widening foreign access 
to the Japanese market and paring down Japan's vast trade 
surplus, broke down in February after Tokyo rejected 
Washington-proposed yardsticks to gauge progress in Japanese 
imports. 
  Saito also said a visit to the U.S. by Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa is a possibility depending on the outcome of Monday's 
unofficial talks. 
  Kakizawa has repeatedly expressed his intention to visit the 
U.S. 
  Saito said the government will consider what steps should be 
taken after the ongoing talks end.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 22 KYODO -- Japan on Sunday [22 May] 
became a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of 
the Child. 
  The Foreign Ministry sent ratification documents to the 
world 
body last month and Japan's participation in the convention came 
into force on Sunday. 
  The convention, which came into force in September 1990, 
addresses the individual rights of children and sets universally 
accepted standards for their protection. 
  Japan is the 158th country to join the child protection 
treaty. 
  Some Japanese have criticized the government for defending a 
part of the country's civil code which they say violates the 
convention by discriminating against and stigmatizing 
illegitimate children. 
  Under the code an illegitimate child's inheritance is set at 
half that of a legitimate child. 
  Also, legitimate children in the family registration system 
are listed in such manner as "eldest son" or "youngest 
daughter," while illegitimate children are listed only as "male" 
or "female."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 21 KYODO -- Key coalition strategist 
Ichiro Ozawa said Saturday [21 May] that North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons development program may turn the situation on 
the Korean peninsula into a serious crisis. 
  In a speech in the northeastern Japan port city of Ofunato, 
Iwate Prefecture, Ozawa said he is "concerned that Japan may be 
isolated in the international community if it cannot do anything 
(about the crisis)." 
  "Many say remittances from Japan (to North Korea) are 
equivalent to North Korea's state budget and that (North Korean) 
high-tech military machines were made in Japan," said Ozawa, the 
secretary general of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party].

  [Text] Tokyo, May 21 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea will 
discuss in Tokyo next Thursday [26 May] ways to promote 
bilateral industrial cooperation for small South Korean 
companies, Japanese Trade Ministry officials said Saturday. 
  Japanese International Trade and Industry Minister [MITI] 
Eijiro Hata and his South Korean counterpart, Kim Chul-su, will

  The program is expected to call for dispatch of Japanese 
experts to South Korea, Japanese companies' acceptance of South 
Korean trainees and promotion of Japanese investment in South 
Korea. 
  During the one-day meeting, both parties will also select 
South Korean companies to serve as models under the industrial 
cooperation program, the officials said. 
  An investment delegation representing 80 blue-chip companies 
in South Korea will accompany Kim. 
  The delegation will seek stepped-up Japanese investment in 
its country in Tokyo, Osaka and Kitakyushu, the MITI officials 
said.

  [Text] Nemuro, Hokkaido, May 22 KYODO -- State Minister 
Moriyoshi Sato on Sunday [22 May] opposed a Russian proposal 
that Japanese fishing ships be allowed to operate in waters off 
four Russian-occupied islands claimed by Japan provided they pay 
fishing charges. 
  "As the Northern Territories are Japan's inherent territory 
(Japan) should not authorize any Russian intervention, including 
joint fishing ventures," said Sato, who is director general of 
the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agencies. 
  Nikolai Pokidin, head of the South Kurils Administration, 
earlier this year proposed that both sides strike a commercial 
deal on fishing in the area. 
  But Tokyo has rejected the proposal out of concern that such 
a step could be taken as an indirect recognition of Russian 
sovereignty over the territory. 
  Sato visited the city of Nemuro on the eastern tip of 
Hokkaido to view the Russian-held islands from Nosappu Point. 
  Japan has long demanded the return of Kunashiri, Etorofu, 
Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets, known in Japan as the 
Northern Territories, which were seized by the Soviet Union at 
the end of World War II. 
  Russia has voiced protest over hundreds of border violations 
by Japanese fishing boats in the area over the last year.

  [Text] Sapporo, May 21 KYODO -- A group of 61 Russians 
from the disputed "northern territories" arrived in Nemuro, 
Hokkaido, on Saturday [21 May] under a visa-free exchange 
program with Japan. 
  Japanese officials said the Russians will go to Yokohama in 
Kanagawa Prefecture where they will visit Chinatown and other 
locations during their Japan stay until Wednesday. 
  The visiting group will also exchange views with the 
Japanese 
sponsors of their trip regarding the Russo-Japanese row over the 
sovereignty of Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai 
group of Islets, the officials said. 
  The group is the second Russian group to come to Japan this 
year under the three-year-old visa-free exchange program. 
  Two Japanese groups recently visited what the Japanese call 
the "northern territories." 
  Soviet troops seized the islands at the end of World War II.

  Five patrol boats are keeping watch on the 500-ton vessel, 
identified as the Montana, which was spotted in waters some 35 
kilometers off Tanegashima Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, Tokyo 
Broadcasting System said. The vessel is sailing slowly 
west-northwest, it said. 
  Maritime Safety Agency officials suspect the passengers may

  On Wednesday, a group of 138 Chinese were apprehended while 
hiding in a warehouse at Hakata port in Fukuoka. They were 
arrested for allegedly entering the country illegally.

Masayoshi Takemura left Tokyo on Sunday [22 May] on a weeklong 
visit to the United States for talks with government and 
congressional leaders on economic and trade issues, and North 
Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program. 
  Sakigake officials said Takemura, 59, will also talk with 
U.S. officials about Japan's bid to become a permanent member of 
the U.N. Security Council. 
  He will address the Asia-Pacific Center in San Francisco on 
Thursday before returning home Saturday, they said. 
  Sakigake, set up by a splinter group of 15 Liberal 
Democratic 
Party (LDP) legislators, quit the ruling coalition in April 
along with the Social Democratic Party (SDP), leaving the 
cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata a minority government.

  [Text] Fukui, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's prototype fast 
breeder reactor "Monju" is now fully loaded with fuel and ready 
for going "critical" throughout the entire core, the 
governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. 
said Friday [20 May]. The last of the 198 fuel assemblies was 
installed in the core the same day, and the reactor is now set 
for full chain reactions of nuclear fission. Monju, located in 
Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, is expected to reach critical state 
early Sunday. 
  The controversial fast breeder reactor reached criticality 
for the first time on April 5, with 168 fuel assemblies 
installed. The reactor, which is fueled by a mixture of 
plutonium oxide and uranium oxide, is believed to have the 
potential to use fuel 60 times more efficiently than 
conventional uranium reactors. 
  Criticality is the point at which the neutrons produced in 
the fission process are sufficient to sustain a chain reaction 
without outside stimulus. 
  Since the reactor reached criticality, the governmental 
agency has been gradually installing the remaining fuel 
assemblies, while experimenting with the critical conditions by 
inserting and removing some of the 19 neutron-absorbing control 
rods. The 280,000-kilowatt prototype reactor will undergo 
further tests in this chain reaction stage before turbines are 
connected in April next year for generating electricity. Full 
operation is scheduled to start in December 1995.

  [Text] Fukui, May 22 KYODO -- Japan's new plutonium-fueled 
fast breeder reactor "Monju" on the Sea of Japan coast went 
"critical" through its entire core at 12:43 a.m. Sunday [22 
May], the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corp. said. Criticality is the point at which the 
neutrons produced in the fission process are sufficient to 
sustain a chain reaction without outside stimulus. The loading 
of Monju with fuel was completed Friday, when the last of the 
198 fuel assemblies was installed in the core. Since then, the 
government agency has been gradually removing the 
neutron-absorbing control rods allowing the reactor to reach 
full criticality. 
  The fast breeder reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, 
reached criticality for the first time April 5, with 168 fuel 
assemblies installed. The reactor, which is fueled by a mixture 
of plutonium oxide and uranium oxide, is believed to have the 
potential to use fuel 60 times more efficiently than 
conventional uranium reactors. 
  The 280,000-kilowatt prototype reactor will undergo further 
tests in this chain reaction stage before its output will 
gradually be increased in February next year. The 600 billion 
yen plant is scheduled to go on line generating electricity from 
April 1995 and become a commercially operating supplier by 
December the same year.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) will urge Japanese 
electric power and major city gas suppliers to avoid raising 
their rates after October, ministry officials said Friday [20 
May]. The power and gas utilities in November 1993 implemented 
a temporary cut in their rates, valid until September, to pass 
on the benefits of the yen's appreciation against the dollar to 
consumers. The stronger yen has reduced crude oil import costs 
for the utilities. 
  The rate cut has lowered the monthly electric power bill for 
the standard household by 100 yen and the city gas cost by 138 
yen. 
  The government said Wednesday it will freeze until the end 
of 
the year proposed hikes in public service charges, including 
power and gas rates, public transportation fares and telephone 
rates. But Hiroshi Watanabe, chairman of the Japan Gas 
Association, told reporters Thursday that member companies plan 
to end the rate cut after October.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- An influential business 
leader welcomed a government decision to freeze public service 
charges until the year-end and expressed hope Friday [20 May] 
that the decision will remain in force for more than two years. 
  Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of 
Corporate 
Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said the decision by the government 
Wednesday to freeze public fee hikes was a welcome move and that 
it should remain in force for at least two years. He said it 
would be unnatural to raise government-controlled fees at a time 
when private enterprises are going all out to restructure 
operations and cut costs.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- The government's move to 
freeze a planned hike in various public services charges will 
give a psychological boost to consumers made cautious by the 
recession, a senior government official said Monday [23 May]. 
  Tsutomu Tanaka, vice minister of the Economic Planning 
Agency, told a press conference that the freeze also will bring 
about other favorable effects on the economy, by prompting 
public utility companies which had planned to raise their 
charges to undergo further restructuring measures. 
  The government announced last Wednesday that public fees 
would not be increased this year, including those for telephone 
services, taxis and national highway tolls. 
  Tanaka said he had been informed of the announcement the 
night before. 
  Asked why Jiro Saito, vice finance minister, was not 
informed 
of the announcement until the next day, as he later complained, 
Tanaka said that he himself was only informed apparently because 
he was due to leave Japan on Wednesday for an Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development meeting in Paris.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The Food Agency said Friday 
[20 May] it made a profit of 53 billion yen in the five-month 
period ended March 31 through emergency imports of rice to deal 
with the poor rice crop last year. The agency said 48 billion 
yen or 90 percent of the profit, which excludes transport and 
other expenses, was transferred to a special account to cover a 
decrease in income by farming households. The agency said it 
made total rice imports of 410,000 tons in the period at an 
average price of 68,000 yen per ton and sold the rice at 218,000 
yen per ton. The agency expects to make a total profit of 300 
billion yen from rice imports in the current grain year ending 
Oct. 30, when it plans to import 2.08 to 2.48 million tons of 
rice, officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 22 KYODO -- Price differences between 
domestic and foreign rice and wheat should be reduced by 20 
percent by the year 2000 to protect Japanese growers from 
foreign rivals with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade talks, a government calculation indicated 
Sunday [22 May]. 
  According to the calculation, the producer rice price 
averaged 17,700 yen per 60 kilograms from 1986 to 1988, more 
than 10 times higher than the price of Thai rice, the cheapest 
on the international rice markets. 
  Under the agreement signed in mid-April by a ministerial 
meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 
Marrakech, Morocco, Japan will open 4 percent of its long-closed 
rice market to imports under a "minimum access" formula with the 
rate increasing each year until it reaches 8 percent. 
  After a six-year grace period, Japan will have to convert 
all 
rice import restrictions into tariffs. 
  Under such conditions, the government should slash its 
purchase price of domestic rice by 18 percent and that of wheat 
by 16 percent from current levels by the year 2000 to make 
domestic production competitive on the international markets, 
according to the government calculation. 
  Base on the calculation, the government plans to gradually 
reduce producer prices of rice and wheat from this year. 
  Under the staple food system, the government buys much of 
the 
rice crop at a set price and resells it at lower prices to 
consumers by subsidizing the price gap.

  [Text] Dalian, China, May 21 KYODO -- The No. 2 man of 
Japan's second largest opposition party on Saturday [21 May] 
urged the minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to 
resign immediately after the state budget passes the Diet. 
  Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Secretary 
General Wataru Kubo said that the Hata cabinet should resign en 
masse soon after the fiscal 1994 budget bills are approved by 
the Diet, and before the opposition camp submits a no-confidence 
motion. 
  Kubo, talking with Japanese reporters traveling with him 
during his current eight-day trip to China since Sunday, said 
the SDPJ is likely to seek a no-confidence vote if Hata refuses 
to step down. 
  The possibility of an SDPJ no-confidence motion would be 
"very high" if the Hata cabinet does not resign en masse, he 
said. 
  The largest opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), has already said it will seek a no-confidence vote after 
the long-delayed budget for fiscal 1994, which began in April, 
clears the Diet. 
  Kubo also hinted the SDPJ, which holds the swing vote in the 
Diet, may move to make a rapprochement with its former coalition 
partners if Hata bows out. 
  If Hata opts for resignation, he said, the SDPJ will 
consider 
that "the score is settled" with the former allies. 
  He was referring to the feud over a new Diet bloc created by 
the coalition partners led by Shinseito, which infuriated the 
SDPJ and resulted in their break from the coalition the day Hata 
was named to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister. 
  The SDPJ's defection from the ruling coalition left Hata 
with 
the first minority government in four decades. 
  The three-week-old Hata administration has been under 
constant pressure from the opposition over what they call an 
insufficient mandate by the public. 
  The opposition's call for Hata to give up the helm began 
moments after he took it. 
  SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made a call last week for 
early general elections for the House of Representatives to 
restore stability in the government. 
  Kubo's remarks Saturday that the SDPJ will likely seek a no- 
confidence vote against Hata unless he voluntarily resigns will 
put the premier in a tight corner since the LDP is almost 
certain to vote against Hata. 
  Defeat by a no-confidence vote would leave Hata with a harsh 
choice of either resigning or calling a snap poll. 
  On the issue of the SDPJ's participation in a successor 
government, Kubo said, "there is no chance that we would return 
to the current ruling coalition." 
  "It should not be a reshuffle of the Hata cabinet. We would 
discuss the issue from a completely new standpoint." 
  Kubo ruled out, however, the possibility of the SDPJ allying 
with the LDP. 
  "A grand LDP-SDPJ coalition, which could lead to a 
resurrection of LDP politics, is not in the cards," he said. 
  The LDP holds 206 seats in the 511-member House of 
Representatives, while the SDPJ has 74, against the ruling 
coalition's 178. 
  Kubo also swiped at the government's increasing pressure on 
a government panel to hurriedly redraw an electoral map for the 
new election system of combined single-seat constituencies and 
proportional representation. 
  Hata and his coalition's top strategist Ichiro Ozawa of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] are dead set against holding 
elections under the old multiseat system, which will be replaced 
with the new system once the electoral map is redrawn in line 
with the Political Reform Law passed in January. 
  Kubo suggested he is opposed to extending the term of the 
current Diet session to pass the bills for the constituency 
changes. The 150-day parliamentary session is due to end June 29. 
  "If the people's voices (calling for general elections) 
emerge before the committee task is finished, we will have no 
choice but to hold elections under the current system," he said. 
  Kubo's call for Hata's early resignation pits him starkly 
against party chief Murayama in jockeying for leadership in the 
party as it tries to build up a new strategy for political 
realignment, political analysts said. 
  Murayama is tilting toward the holding of early elections 
under the old multiseat constituency system to recover the 
SDPJ's loss of seats in the lower house before making its next 
political move. 
  Behind Kubo's gambit is his more sober assessment that the 
SDPJ's victory in the elections is far from secured, party 
sources said. 
  Kubo, therefore, moved toward what he believes is a more 
plausible path of going back to the ruling party, one analyst 
said. 
  It is, however, by no means clear what kind of political 
realignment he has in mind for his strategic moves, since many 
SDPJ lawmakers are adverse to joining hands with Ozawa's 
Shinseito, they said.

  [Text] Fukushima, May 22 KYODO -- The leader of the 
country's second largest opposition party renewed its call for 
the minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to resign 
immediately after the state budget passes the Diet. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], said there is no difference of opinion 
between him and the party's No. 2 man, Wataru Kubo, the SDPJ 
secretary general. 
  On Saturday in China, Kubo said that the Hata cabinet should 
resign en masse soon after the Diet approves the fiscal 1994 
budget bills and before the opposition camp submits a 
no-confidence motion. 
  Murayama, delivering a speech in the city of Fukushima, some 
270 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, said talks can be launched 
among various political parties to restructure the coalition 
government. 
  The present coalition is mainly formed by Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party], Komeito, and the Japan New Party. The SDPJ, 
which was the No. 1 component of the previous cabinet led by 
Morihiro Hosokawa, quit the coalition late last month in protest 
against the abrupt formation of a large parliamentary group 
excluding the SDPJ. 
  Meanwhile, the SDPJ chairman also said a dissolution of the 
House of Representatives for a snap general election might be 
inevitable in the event of political turmoil. "There may be no 
other way but to seek the judgment of voters," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
on Monday [23 May] spurned an opposition demand to disband his 
minority cabinet upon parliamentary passage of the fiscal 1994 
state budget. 
  "There should not be a standoff between the ruling coalition 
and the opposition camp," Hata told the House of Representatives 
Budget Committee. He added that his administration, "is 
sincerely seeking to implement the common policy agreement." 
  The premier was responding to a query by Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) legislator Shun Oide. 
  The SDP, which was the No. 1 component of the previous 
cabinet led by Morihiro Hosokawa, stormed out of the coalition 
late last month in protest against the abrupt formation of a 
large parliamentary group excluding the SDP. The SDP's move 
forced Hata to form Japan's first minority government in 39 
years. 
  SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo demanded Saturday that the 
Hata Cabinet should resign en masse after the fiscal 1994 budget 
bills are approved by the Diet, and before the opposition camp 
submits a motion of no-confidence. 
  Kubo also hinted that the SDP, which holds the deciding vote 
in the Diet, may move to make a reconciliation with its former 
coalition partners if Hata bows out. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Sunday there is no 
difference of opinion between him and Kubo. Murayama said a 
dissolution of the lower house for a snap general election might 
be inevitable in the event of political turmoil. 
  Yohei Kono, president of the largest opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party, said Monday he agrees with the SDP on the 
issue. 
  Oide urged Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa to withdraw his 
recently published comments that Japan needs to apply a more 
flexible interpretation to the Constitution in order to defend 
itself in the face of a "possible threat from North Korea's 
missiles and the buildup of China's naval forces." 
  Oide took issue with a statement of Kakizawa's published in 
a 
book that carried proposals from 200 intellectuals and 
politicians. 
  Kakizawa rejected Oide's demand to renege his conviction 
about Japan's defense policy, while promising to live up to the 
Hata administration's vow not to amend interpretation of the 
Constitution. 
  Hata rejected Oide's demand that Kakizawa be dismissed as 
foreign minister to take account for his remark. 
  Hata renewed a pledge Monday to seek the passage of the 
overdue fiscal 1994 state budget by the end of the current Diet 
session as discussions on the budget finally started. 
  Hata said,"I really hope the budget passes in the current 
Diet session by any means. I will make most sincere efforts for 
that." The Diet session is scheduled to end June 29. 
  "I feel great responsibility. I regret the delay," Hata 
said. Nearly 80 days have passed since the government submitted 
the budget to the Diet for deliberations. 
  He was responding to questions by an LDP legislator Takashi 
Fukaya. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai denied he is seeking 
an extension of the term of the current Diet session to ensure 
the passage of the budget. 
  Hata declined to talk about an extension of the Diet 
session, 
saying it is a matter that should be decided by the Diet. 
  Kumagai also promised a formal report on the recent "sexist" 
remarks by Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito and top 
policy strategist in the ruling coalition. 
  Kumagai said he will directly ask Ozawa what he really meant 
by the remarks and will brief the committee session. 
  He was referring to Ozawa's remarks last month which 
defended 
the move among some coalition partners to create a new Diet bloc 
without the SDP. 
  Comparing the convergence of various political parties to an 
extramarital affair, Ozawa reportedly told reporters, "it 
doesn't matter which women you may sleep with." 
  Kumagai said the remarks are "not appropriate if they were 
really made."

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F>
program] 
  [Text] In the upper house Budget Committee session today, 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata explained the coalition's uniform 
definition of the expression Fuhenteki Anzen Hosho [Universal 
Security] -- the expression used in describing Japan's concept 
of security in the coalition parties' policy agreements. Hata 
said the coalition's uniform view is that this expression refers 
only to the general framework of peace and security provided by 
the United Nations. 
  The collective security in the UN Charter means a 
cooperative 
act by the international community to restore peace if peace is 
threatened or an act of aggression takes place. The charter 
also talks about possible specific actions, including military 
operations. But Prime Minister Hata said the concept of 
universal security refers to the general framework accepted by 
the international community on maintaining peace and security 
under the United Nations. He said this term is different from 
collective security, but did not clarify whether this term has a 
military connotation. 
  The coalition partners have been said to have different 
views 
on the question of whether the term [universal security] 
included the possibility of military action. Prime Minister 
Hata had earlier told the lower house Budget Committee that the 
words -- universal security and collective security -- have 
roughly the same meaning. 
  Today's announcement that the two terms do have different 
meanings amounts to an amendment to Hata's earlier statement. 
Observers said this is an attempt by the coalition partners to 
avoid giving the impression that since the two terms are said to 
be the same thing, the Japanese Government may be willing to 
take part in UN military operations.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 23 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
renewed a pledge Monday [23 May] to seek the passage of the 
overdue fiscal 1994 state budget by the end of the current Diet 
session as discussions on the budget finally started. 
  Hata told the House of Representatives budget committee, "I 
really hope the budget passes in the current Diet session by any 
means. I will make most sincere efforts for that." The Diet 
session is scheduled to end June 29. 
  He apologized for the delay in the budget debate due mainly 
to the political turmoil over former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's shady personal finances, which forced his resignation 
last month. 
  "I feel great responsibility. I regret the delay," Hata 
said. Nearly 80 days have passed since the government submitted 
the budget to the Diet for deliberations. 
  He was responding to questions by an opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party legislator Takashi Fukaya. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai denied he is seeking 
an extension of the term of the current Diet session to ensure 
the passage of the budget. 
  Hata declined to talk about an extension of the Diet 
session, 
saying it is a matter that should be decided by the Diet. 
  Kumagai also promised a formal report on the recent "sexist" 
remarks by Ichiro Ozawa, top policy strategist in the ruling 
coalition. 
  Kumagai said he will directly ask Ozawa what he really meant 
by the remarks and will brief the committee session. 
  He was referring to Ozawa's remarks last month which 
defended 
the move among some coalition partners to create a new Diet bloc 
without the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which led to 
defection by the angry SDP, the largest coalition component. 
  Comparing the convergence of various political parties to an 
extramarital affair, Ozawa reportedly told reporters, "it 
doesn't matter which women you may sleep with." 
  Kumagai said the remarks are "not appropriate if they were 
really made." 
  LDP's Fukaya also questioned Hata over what he calls a 
"vague" concept in the government's defense policy. 
  He blasted the coalition's policy platform, which says 
Japan's constitution adopts "universal security," saying such a 
concept does not exist in international law or the UN Charter. 
  Hata said universal security is a wide concept that roughly 
corresponds to the constitution's idea about the nation's 
security. 
  It is a bit wider concept than the collective security as 
defined in the UN Charter, but not quite far from it, he added. 
  Concerning the possibility of Japan's military involvements 
in international crises, Hata reiterated that the government 
will handle the situation within the framework of the 
constitution. 
  Fukaya, unsatisfied with the answers, sought a unified view 
by the government over the security issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- The government's Tax 
Commission has begun crafting several "alternatives" for a 
comprehensive overhaul of Japan's tax system, commission chief 
Kan Kato said Friday [20 May]. But these alternatives, to be 
presented at public hearings across the nation starting June 7, 
will not indicate any certain direction of the commission's tax 
reform policy, Kato told a press conference. 
  After carefully studying the pros and cons of each 
alternative, the commission will devise a tax reform plan in 
line with the three principles put forward by former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in April, Kato said after emerging 
from a tax panel session. The three principles include tilting 
toward indirect taxation such as a consumption tax to ease the 
people's heavy income tax burden, establishing how to cover the 
increasing welfare-related expenses of a rapidly aging society, 
and the reorganization of Japan's fiscal status. 
  Kato voiced his personal hope that the "final option" for 
tax 
reform will be one which seeks a net tax increase in view of the 
spirit of these principles. Kato said some commission members 
have requested the final reform proposal be shown in 
quantitative terms, such as specifying the rate of a proposed 
consumption tax hike. But on this point, accord has yet to be 
reached with others who insist that rate fixing is "a highly 
political decision," he said. 
  One of the "alternatives" to be suggested by the Tax 
Commission for overhauling Japan's taxation system is a hike in 
the consumption tax from the current 3 percent, commission 
sources said. 
  The commission will recommend several possible hikes in the 
rate, centering around 7 percent, based on different economic 
outlooks, growth rates and business climates, as well as the 
duration of income tax cuts before a consumption tax hike takes 
effect, the sources said. The commission is also poised to 
recommend that the government maintain the new income tax rates, 
which are to be slashed this year, the sources said. 
  "It would be reasonable for the hike in consumption tax to 
come about three years after the income tax cuts," Kato told 
reporters. 
  Japan has sought overall reforms of its taxation system, 
partly to stimulate its economy through a reduction in income 
tax and to prepare for increasing welfare expenses in a rapidly 
aging society. 
  In order to secure funds to cover such policies, the 
government is considering the higher consumption tax or 
introduction of a new kind of tax. 
  In February, Morihiro Hosokawa, then prime minister, 
suggested the establishment of a 7-percent "national welfare 
tax." The new tax plan was shelved due to strong opposition 
among politicians who claimed the plan was proposed abruptly and 
lacked a clear vision.

  [Text] Utsunomiya, May 21 KYODO -- The leader of new party 
Sakigake [Harbinger], a 15-member opposition group in the House 
of Representatives, criticized chief coalition strategist Ichiro 
Ozawa on Saturday [21 May] of trying to turn the country into a 
major military power. 
  In a speech in Utsunomiya, some 110 kilometers north of 
Tokyo, Masayoshi Takemura said he was opposed to Ozawa's 
argument for turning Japan into what Ozawa calls an "ordinary 
country." 
  When Ozawa says "ordinary country," he means one which owns 
a 
military commensurate with its economic capability and assumes 
responsibility jointly with the United States for troubles in 
the world, Takemura said. 
  Takemura, who served as chief cabinet secretary until late 
last month in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, said his party will never follow the path toward such 
a military power. 
  Takemura said Japan should make international contributions 
in such nonmilitary fields as environmental protection, 
north-south issues, aids and narcotics. 
  Ozawa is regarded as the de facto leader of the ruling 
coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], which is 
nominally headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  While Ozawa calls for changing Japan into an "ordinary 
country," Takemura has proposed the nation be a "small but 
twinkling country." 
  Many political analysts say differences between Ozawa and 
Takemura represented the underlying cause for the breakup of the 
Hosokawa cabinet. 
  Takemura's Sakigake did not send any member to the Hata 
cabinet, but has vowed to back it up from the outside of the 
cabinet until the fiscal 1994 budget passes through the Diet.

  [Text] Mizusawa, Iwate Pref., May 20 KYODO -- The ruling 
coalition's political kingpin predicted Friday [20 May] that a 
gulf among Japanese political parties over security and tax 
policies will force a further reconfiguration of their alliance. 
  Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], a core party in the coalition, told a lecture meeting 
here, "the political community will inevitably undergo another 
restructuring due to policy issues." He said this 
reconfiguration will be necessitated by sharply conflicting 
policies of political parties concerning Japan's tax system 
reform and defense policy. 
  Ozawa was apparently referring to profound gaps among the 
parties over a proposed raising of indirect taxes to bolster 
state revenues, and Japan's response to the suspected North 
Korean nuclear arms program. 
  Ozawa dismissed the seriousness of the April 26 withdrawal 
of 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) from the coalition, which has 
left the Hata administration as a fragile, minority government. 
  "We do not have to get upset" by the pullout, he said. The 
rift was triggered by the abrupt formation of a unified 
parliamentary bloc in the House of Representatives, excluding 
the SDP. He branded as "irrational" ongoing talks between the 
Liberal Democratic Party and the SDP toward forming their own 
alliance. 
  "I do not worry about such moves, as I believe that those 
who 
can think and act reasonably will take a rational course of 
action," he said. "Because Japan needs to restore political 
stability as quickly as possible, we have to alleviate the 
current turmoil and transform the administration into a stable 
government by expediting the restructuring of the political 
community," Ozawa said. 
  Ozawa predicted that the next election for the House of 
Representatives will be contested under the new single-seat 
constituency system which was pushed through the Diet in January. 
  He made the statement as the administration faces the 
possibility that the opposition camp's tabling of a 
no-confidence motion against it in the Diet could force Prime 
Minister Hata to call the election under the current multiseat 
constituency system. 
  Japan must legislate an electoral redistricting bill that 
would split the current multiseat constituencies into 300 
single-seat constituencies, if it is to hold the next election 
lawfully under the single-seat system. The January legislation, 
combined with the redistricting bill, will replace the existing 
511 seat multiseat system of elections for the lower chamber 
with a mix of 300 single-seat constituencies and proportional 
representation, under which the remaining 200 seats would be 
allocated.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 22 KYODO -- The tiny United Social 
Democratic Party (USDP), which helped last August to oust the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after almost four decades in 
power, formally dissolved Sunday [22 May], closing the book on 
16 years of political activity. 
  The move, long anticipated as USDP Secretary General Shogo 
Abe last December announced that the party's "historical 
mission" has been fulfilled with the government change, was made 
at a national party convention in Tokyo. 
  Abe and party chief Satsuki Eda, who served as science and 
technology agency chief in the non-LDP coalition government 
under Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, has already joined 
Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP). 
  The party's third Diet legislator, Yanosuke Narazaki, will 
retain his House of Representatives seat as an independent but 
is closely affiliated with the Social Democratic Party [of 
Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ]. 
  Many of the USDP's estimated 10,000 members in some 22 local 
party organizations, some of which have voiced ardent opposition 
to the dissolution of their party originally scheduled for 
January this year, are expected to enter the JNP. 
  The USDP, founded in March 1978, evolved from the Socialist 
Citizens' League, which was formed in 1977 by a group of 
right-wing members of the then Japan Socialist Party (JSP), in 
conformity with the wishes of Eda's deceased father, JSP 
defector Saburo Eda. 
  The party saw itself as bridging the gap between the JSP and 
its right-wing splinter, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). 
  Since the 1985 party congress, Eda and Abe have been leading 
the party. Though a small party, the USDP wielded a certain 
influence through cooperation in supraparty bodies and 
parliamentary alliances with the SDPJ and the DSP. 
  During its 16-year history, the USDP, struggling to find a 
raison d'etre between two other socialist parties and disrupted 
by intraparty differences, was more than once close to 
disintegration. 
  In an effort to reinvigorate the party in 1992, Eda founded 
the political study group "Sirius" together with reformers in 
the SDPJ, but the body collapsed after the USDP suffered major 
losses in the general election in July last year.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The Radio Regulatory Council, an advisory body to 
the post and telecommunications minister, has submitted a report 
on the future use of high-definition television [HDTV]. The 
report proposes that licenses for HDTV broadcasting should be 
granted to different stations for each day of the week beginning 
this autumn, when test-broadcasting is scheduled to begin, and 
that one of the satellite television channels should be 
tentatively allocated for HDTV broadcasting after 1997, when 
fully-fledged broadcasting is scheduled to begin. 
  The Post and Telecommunications Ministry plans to start 
test- 
broadcasting HDTV programs after the current round of 
test-broadcasting ends this autumn. It also plans to start full 
HDTV broadcasting after 1997 using a new satellite to replace 
the current BS-3 satellite. 
  Licenses for HDTV broadcasting are currently granted only to 
the Hi-Definition Television Promotion Association. Today's 
report recommends that this should be revised so that all 
television stations will be able to produce programs 
independently. According to the report, licenses for 
test-broadcasting will be granted to different stations for each 
day of the week, and each station will be allocated more than 
five hours of broadcasting time. NHK will also have more than 
five hours of broadcasting everyday, providing a combined total 
of more than 10 hours of HDTV broadcasting a day by NHK and 
commercial stations. Commercial stations will be allowed to air 
advertising. 
  The report says three of the eight channels on the new 
broadcasting satellite will be allocated for current satellite 
broadcasting channels. However, these channels will be used for 
HDTV broadcasting when HDTV sets become more common. The other 
five channels will be allocated for both HDTV and conventional 
broadcasts -- one will be tentatively reserved for HDTV 
broadcasts. The report says commercial stations can specialize 
in sports, news or other areas of their choice, and they will be 
allowed to air advertising and charge fees for their programs. 
  NHK and commercial stations will soon apply to the ministry 
for licenses for HDTV test-broadcasting.

<F P=106> [By Keiji Urakami] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, May 21 KYODO -- The recent attempt by a 
Japanese rice retailer to offer discount gasoline may accelerate 
a drive to eliminate a complicated web of rules and regulations 
in this country. 
  Earlier this week, Nagoya suburbs-based Kanare Beikoku 
created a stir in Japan's consumer front by opening without a 
license a gas station that sells gasoline at 10-15 yen less per 
liter than at other stations. 
  "The move was in protest against the government's licensing 
policy," said an official at Kanare Beikoku. 
  Analysts say the rice retailer challenged conventional 
gasoline distribution networks firmly protected under 
administrative guidance of the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry (MITI). 
  MITI's local unit did not issue a business license to Kanare 
Beikoku, claiming it could not confirm the routes by which the 
retailer plans to obtain gasoline supplies. 
  MITI says the rule, stipulated under the Gasoline Sales and 
Distribution Business Law, is intended to secure a stable supply 
of gasoline. 
  Kanare Beikoku cuts middlemen and buys cheaper gasoline 
directly from trading houses, defying a usual practice among 
Japanese gas stations of securing product sources by belonging 
to one of the major oil wholesalers. 
  It is widely believed that Kanare Beikoku did not clarify 
the 
supply routes, expecting a licensing application without forming 
an affiliation with major wholesalers would be rejected by MITI. 
  "MITI's administrative rule effectively blocks new business 
entry by gasoline discounters," said Katsutoshi Kano, president 
of Kanare Beikoku. 
  MITI has appeared baffled by an unexpectedly large media 
coverage of the case that said the rule in question keeps 
Japanese motorists paying four times what their American 
counterparts pay for gasoline. 
  One editorial at a major newspaper has cast doubt even over 
the necessity of securing "stable" sources of gasoline. 
  "Any gas stations having trouble in securing gasoline go 
under," the editorial said. That's a market mechanism. 
Consumers would not be affected." 
  In an apparent softening of the ministry's previous stance, 
Vice MITI Minister Hideaki Kumano told a press conference that 
there is room to review the rule. 
  A senior official at the Natural Resources and Energy Agency 
admitted the regulation was originally crafted as a way to 
prevent excessive price-cutting competition among gas stations. 
  "But it may be timely to discuss the validity of maintaining 
the regulation," he said, apparently having in his mind the 
recent "price revolution" in all consumer fronts in Japan. 
  The latest incident over gasoline sale may have embarrassed 
MITI because it took place just one day after the ministry 
announced a set of bills aimed at scrapping or easing government 
control on rules and regulations. 
  MITI submitted nine bills to the current Diet sitting Friday 
[20 May] along with 31 other bills written by other ministries, 
in line with the government's deregulation policy. 
  Among the nine bills, one calls for abolition of a rule that 
requires antidecay treatment of lumber for use in telegraph 
poles and railroad ties. 
  "Nobody uses lumber for such purposes now," MITI explained. 
  Earlier this week, MITI placed "letter boxes" at its local 
offices across the nation to receive complaints, requests and 
opinions from general consumers on its deregulation policy. 
  In view of the recent national trend toward deregulation, 
Kanare Beikoku may have a fairly good chance of winning a fight 
against MITI, often labeled abroad as a faithful guardian of 
rigid administrative rules. 
  The government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata recently vowed 
to come up with powerful deregulative measures by the end of 
June as part of efforts to bolster domestic demand and hence the 
nation's appetite for imports. 
  Relaxing economically restrictive government regulations is 
a 
mission of his administration, Hata said. 
  During the previous administration of Prime Minister 
Morihiro 
Hosokawa, the Office of Trade and Industry Ombudsman of the 
Economic Planning Agency was upgraded to ministerial level. 
  Earlier this month, the Ombudsman proposed a set of 
deregulative measures in response to complaints from consumers. 
  The proposal covers many aspects of people's livelihood, 
ranging from a simpler auto inspection system designed to cut 
inspection costs running over 100,000 yen to a reduction in a 
layer of procedures for obtaining import permission for 
cosmetics and perfume. 
  The social trend appears difficult for MITI to reverse. 
  Under the law, Kanare Beikoku faces fines of up to 300,000 
yen. But the senior official at the Natural Resources and Energy 
Agency, a MITI unit, said MITI does not plan to enforce the law 
immediately. 
  "We will patiently ask the retailer to take a due 
procedure," 
the official said, hinting that the ministry wants to look the 
other way in order not to draw public attention on the issue. 
  Imposing penalties against the gas station would only 
aggravate public sentiment against MITI. 
  Kanare Beikoku's President Kano may be encouraged by strong 
support of consumers. 
  The gas station proved an instant hit with motorists, with 
their cars lining up early in the morning to buy gasoline at 100 
yen per liter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Transport Minister Nobuaki Futami by NHK </F>
announcer Yoshiaki Kawabata -- via live relay from the Ministry 
of Transportation in Tokyo; from the "NHK News 7" program] 
  [Text] [Kawabata] Mr. Futami, the China Airlines [CAL] 
crash took place just before you took office. I believe the 
crash was a very tragic accident. First of all, I would like to 
ask you what kind of take safety measures are you going to take 
for the airline industry? 
  [Futami] I toured the crash site on 6 May. I landed at Chubu 
Airport aboard a YS-11 airplane that flew the same route as the 
China Airlines plane. The crash was a very tragic accident. I 
am resolved to do everything in my power to prevent the 
recurrence of such a crash in our nation. I have asked an 
investigative committee to speedily determine the cause of the 
crash for the sake of future safety. At the same time, I have 
asked the committee to make public information obtained as a 
result of the investigation to prevent a recurrence of such a 
crash. The voice recorder has been analyzed and the result of 
the analysis came to light on 30 April. The Transport Ministry 
is now taking various necessary safety measures while 
instructing or guiding concerned aviation organizations. 
  [Kawabata] This question concerns compensation negotiations 
between the bereaved families of victims and China Airlines. Mr. 
Futami, you have said the Transport Ministry would provide the 
bereaved families with maximum assistance. Would you spell out 
maximum assistance? 
  [Futami] I think that the negotiations will begin between 
the 
bereaved families and the China Airlines. As you know, there are 
no diplomatic relations between Japan and Taiwan. I think the 
bereaved families are at a loss over how to proceed with the 
negotiations. The Transport Ministry intends to provide the 
bereaved families with all possible support while consulting 
with the Foreign Ministry. For the moment, I cannot specifically 
explain how our ministry plans to help the bereaved families 
since the negotiations have yet to begin. The Transport Ministry 
intends to provide the bereaved families maximum support while 
watching the progress of the negotiations. 
  [Kawabata] Mr. Minister, I would like to ask you about 
deregulation. As I reported at the outset of this evening news 
program, Keidanren [the Federation of Economic Organizations of 
Japan] today presented Prime Minister Hata with a report calling 
for the deregulation of 196 items. Upon receiving the report, 
Prime Minister Hata promised to take the leadership. Mr. 
Futami, how do you plan to exercise your leadership in 
deregulation in the transport area? 
  [Futami] I intend to aggressively work on deregulation on 
the 
basis of free enterprise. I have seen the report presented by 
Keidanren. I think it is a good one, compiled after months of 
hard study. I am thinking of asking my ministry officials to 
study it without haste. 
  [Kawabata] I would like to ask you about deregulation of the 
airline industry. The Aviation Council is expected to compile a 
report in June, at the earliest. I believe that the report will 
call for deregulation of the airline industry in order to 
bolster the industry's competitiveness. How are you going to 
deregulate domestic airfares, which are higher than fiercely 
competitive international airfares? 
  [Futami] Japanese airlines spend too much on personnel 
compared with foreign airlines. For their sound management, we 
have to study how to cut personnel expenses. I believe that it 
is desirable for the Japanese airlines to hire more foreigners. 
I believe that the Japanese airlines need to examine the 
possibility of selling tickets at a certain discount rate for 
domestic flights. It is said that domestic air fare is cheap in 
Europe. They are offering discount tickets. I think it is a 
good idea. 
  [Kawabata] The Hata government was formed by political 
parties holding a minority in the Diet. How do you think the 
Hata government should resolve issues in the future? 
  [Futami] Generally speaking, the present political situation 
is a tough trial for the ruling coalition parties. I believe 
that Japanese politics itself is now going through a major 
trial. At present, no single political party in Japan can hold 
the majority in the Diet unless the Liberal Democratic Party and 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan forge a coalition. Under 
this political situation, if each party pursues its own 
interests, nothing can be done, leaving Japan in a state of 
anarchy. The government, therefore, needs to put forth clear 
policies to the people while asking both ruling and opposition 
parties to debate those policies in the Diet. I believe that if 
the ruling and opposition parties debate those policies in the 
Diet, it would pave the way for dispelling public distrust in 
politics. I think it is important that the ruling and opposition 
parties show the people that they are vigorously engaged in 
policy debates in the Diet without pursuing their own interests. 
  The work of the Transport Ministry is related closely to our 
lives. I therefore am confident that not only the ruling 
coalition parties, but the opposition parties will gladly 
cooperate with the Transport Ministry. I am also confident that 
as far as the Transport Ministry is concerned, all opposition 
parties will fully cooperate with any proposals made by the 
ruling coalition parties, even if they hold a minority in the 
Diet. 
  [Kawabata] Mr. Futami, thank for being with me.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 21 KYODO -- A sense of concern is 
growing in the Bank of Japan (BOJ) over a narrowing gap between 
short-term interest rates and the official discount rate, 
financial sources said Saturday [21 May]. 
  The central bank is pursuing a policy of encouraging a fall 
in short-term interest rates to help promote Japan's economic 
recovery and to support the flagging U.S. dollar. 
  The policy caused the unsecured, overnight interbank call 
money rate to fall to a record low of 2.06 percent on May 11. 
  The rate has remained little changed since then and is now 
only 0.3 percentage point higher than the official discount 
rate, now 1.75 percent, which the BOJ charges on its loans to 
commercial banks. 
  That means that the BOJ, whose loans are becoming less 
attractive to commercial banks, is losing some of its power to 
adjust commercial interest rates, the sources said. 
  Some money market watchers are already speculating that a 
further cut in the discount rate is imminent. 
  For the record, BOJ officials are unconcerned about the fall 
in the overnight call money rate, saying a temporary fall in the 
rate below the discount rate would do little harm.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 21 KYODO -- In Japan, often described as 
one of the safest countries in the world, the private security 
industry is doing a thriving business, with the number of 
private guards exceeding police by 1.4 times, the National 
Police Agency said Saturday [21 May]. 
  As of the end of 1993, some 320,000 private security staff 
were guarding companies and private homes in Japan, reflecting a 
rising awareness of security and a soaring demand for 
surveillance, the agency said, while the number of police 
totaled about 223,000. 
  The agency said the private security boom has been fueled by 
the spread of the five-day work week, with facilities remaining 
closed during the weekend, and an increasing number of the 
elderly feeling uneasy about safety. 
  The number of private security staff first outstripped that 
of police officers in 1990, when it reached 230,000 guards. 
  Since 1972, the year when a law on private security 
companies 
was enacted, the number of firms has increased ninefold to 
7,062, with a corresponding jump in staff by 7.8 times to an 
overall 321,721. 
  The 1993 figures represent a year-on-year increase of 7.4 
percent for the number of companies and a 10.4 percent rise in 
staff. 
  Women made a slight inroad into the male-dominated security 
business in 1993, boosting their share to 5.9 percent, or 18,880 
guards, from 5.2 percent. 
  In 1993, the security business registered a record 1.56 
trillion yen in annual turnover, a slight increase over the 
previous year. 
  The business has also profited from a diversification trend. 
Private guards nowadays work as bodyguards for politicians and 
prominent people, direct traffic, monitor festivals and other 
events or accompany cash deliveries and the transport of 
hazardous goods. 
  Private guards were involved in more than 200 on-the-spot 
arrests and joined police investigations into some 170 cases 
last year, the agency said.

  [Text] It has been learned that in a meeting of the U.S. 
National Security Council held early this morning at the White 
House, the United States has decided to hold a third round of 
high- level talks with North Korea as soon as possible. In 
today's meeting, the United States has reportedly discussed the 
resumption of the third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level 
talks in Geneva next month, at the earliest, as a result of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency's report that North Korea is 
cooperating on the nuclear inspections.

  [Text] The ROK Government reportedly came to the 
conclusion on 22 May not to object to the exclusion of the issue 
of resuming North-South dialogue from the official agenda of the 
third-round North Korea-U.S. talks. 
  The government also established a policy that the government 
will propose a delegates' contact for high-level North-South 
talks and seek ways to improve North-South relations in general 
by holding various joint commission meetings, including the 
Joint Nuclear Control Commission, if North Korea agrees to 
returning to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and inspections 
of undeclared facilities in the third round of the North 
Korea-U.S. talks. 
  The government policy is a step forward compared to when it 
withdrew the precondition of the special envoy exchange for the 
third-round of North Korea-U.S. talks announced on 15 April. 
The policy is based on the analysis that, in the current 
situation, assurance of North Korea's nuclear transparency can 
be hastened by momentarily separating the resumption of 
North-South dialogue from the nuclear issue to prevent it from 
being a point of dispute. 
  A high-ranking government official said: "The government 
position is that it would not object to not discussing the 
resumption of North-South dialogue, including the implementation 
of mutual nuclear inspections between the North and the South, 
during the North Korea- U.S. talks." 
  The official continued: "Although North Korea disapproves of 
the resumption of North-South dialogue, it will be inevitable 
after the settlement of North Korea-U.S. talks, for instance, 
during the process of supporting the replacement of North 
Korea's graphite moderated reactors with light water reactors." 
  Linkage of the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise, which 
had been discussed in connection with nuclear inspections of 
North Korea, with the future development of North-South 
relations, is reportedly undergoing careful consideration by the 
government.

  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the United 
States are expected to have working-level talks in Washington 
very shortly to discuss matters related to third-round

  Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku said at a National Assembly 
Foreign Affairs and Unification Committee session Monday that 
the third-round U.S.-North Korea meeting could be agreed on 
before long at the U.S.-North working-level contacts. 
  A South Korea-U.S. working-level meeting is set to be held 
in 
Washington soon in connection with the U.S.-North Korea 
high-level talks likely to take place shortly in pace with a

  [Text] Seoul, May 21 (YONHAP) -- Ambassador for Nuclear 
Affairs Kim Sam-hun on Friday left for Washington to discuss the 
North Korean nuclear impasse. 
  During his stay in Washington for four to five days, Kim is 
scheduled to meet with U.S. Government officials including 
Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci to evaluate the 
present state of the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  They will focus on joint Korea-U.S countermeasures in view 
of 
the inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  South Korea and the United States will reportedly agree on 
opening a third round of talks between Washington and Pyongyang 
next month if Pyongyang accepts the IAEA's proposal to stop 
refueling the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon and if the spent 
fuel rods that have already been removed are stored in good 
shape. 
  In addition, Seoul and Washington will determine their 
position on subjects to be discussed at the Washington-Pyongyang 
meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by Beijing-based correspondent Yi Tong-sik] </F>
  [Text] Chu Chang-chun, North Korean ambassador to China, 
in a news conference today, said that North Korea showed the 
nuclear fuel rods being replaced at the nuclear reactor in 
Yongbyon to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspection team. 
  In a news conference for foreign reporters held at the North 
Korean Embassy in Beijing this afternoon, Ambassador Chu 
stressed that although North Korea showed the IAEA inspectors 
the nuclear fuel rods, North Korea does not have the obligation 
to permit any inspection, thus hinting that an actual nuclear 
inspection was not made. 
  Ambassador Chu also said that if a package solution is 
agreed 
upon on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula at the third 
round of talks between North Korea and the United States, the 
IAEA could supervise [kamsi] the replacement of the fuel rods at 
any time, thus making it clear that North Korea will link the 
nuclear inspection with its third round of talks with the United 
States.

  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Hong- ku said on Monday the exchange of fuel rods at a 
5-megawatt atomic reactor at Yongbyon, North Korea is believed 
to have been 10 to 15 percent complete so far. Yi's remarks mean 
that of the total 8,100 fuel rods at the reactor, about 1,000 
have been replaced. 
  Speaking at a National Assembly Foreign Affairs and 
Unification Committee meeting, Yi said the initial report from 
an IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspection team 
indicated that there is no significant problem with respect to 
the storage and future gauging of selected fuel bars from the 
reactor. "The IAEA will have full-fledged negotiations with 
North Korea over this matter beginning Tuesday," Yi said. 
  Earlier in the day at a breakfast meeting hosted by the 
Korean Newspaper Editors Association, Yi said his recent remarks 
that "the South-North denuclearization declaration will be made 
void and null if North Korea were found to have even a half 
nuclear weapon" was the expression of his view directed 
indirectly toward the United States. 
  Yi made the remarks when asked by Democratic Party Rep. 
Namkung Chin what was his view of a recent statement of U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry, in which Perry spoke as if 
his country would connive at one or two nuclear weapons in the 
possession of North Korea.

<F P=106> [Report by Correspondent Yi Tong-sik from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] While additional inspections of North Korea are 
smoothly coming to an end, a working-level negotiation team of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] arrived in Beijing 
this morning. The two-man negotiation team led by Inspections 
Bureau chief (Perry Corse), will leave for Pyongyang at 1520 
tomorrow afternoon [0620 GMT 24 May] via Koryo Airlines after 
staying in Beijing today. While there, the team will conduct 
negotiations with relevant North Korean officials over the 
replacement of nuclear fuel rods. 
  The three inspectors, including chief of Inspections Section 
(Heinonen), who have been watching the replacement of nuclear 
fuel rods while conducting additional inspections in Yongbyon 
after entering North Korea on 19 May, will conclude its 
additional inspections today and leave Pyongyang tomorrow. 
However, the possibility remains that the three-man inspection 
team will present to the working-level negotiation team a report 
on the comprehensive status surrounding the replacement of 
nuclear fuel rods and join the negotiation team. 
  It is expected that the working-level negotiations will 
proceed for at least four to five days this time. There is 
concern, however, that if both sides should stand up to each 
other tensely by sticking only to their previous positions, the 
negotiations will directly stalemate like last August's nuclear 
negotiations.

negotiation team will enter North Korea tomorrow and have 
consultations over details of how it will go about witnessing 
the replacement of nuclear fuel rods at the Yongbyon atomic 
reactor. Correspondent Yi Tong-sik provides us with this report 
from Beijing: 
  [Begin recording] Two IAEA inspectors led by Inspections 
Bureau chief (Perry Corse) arrived in Beijing via Scandinavian 
Airways this morning. At the airport, he said only that he 
would enter Pyongyang via Koryo Airlines tomorrow afternoon and 
have discussions over technical matters in North Korea. 
  He added that he would soon meet the team conducting 
additional inspections in North Korea, including Inspections 
Section Chief (Heinonen). Therefore, he is expected to be 
presented with a comprehensive report in North Korea, from 
Inspections Section Chief (Heinonen) on the status of witnessing 
and observing the replacement of nuclear fuel rods at the 5-MW 
atomic reactor in Yongbyon and the sample-taking at the 
radiochemical laboratory. 
  Although the IAEA negotiation team says that it will only 
have discussions over technical matters, the main goal of the 
negotiations of this time is reportedly to ask the North Korean 
side to take necessary measures for confirming, and continuing 
to confirm in the future, too, whether nuclear material has not 
been diverted since the atomic reactor began operations in 
(?1986) until now. 
  Those in diplomatic circles in Beijing predict, however, 
that 
these negotiations will not proceed smoothly, because although 
the IAEA teams are being allowed to visit North Korea to witness 
inspections, they will only be allowed to witness the sealing of 
the removed nuclear fuel under the pretext of North Korea being 
in a unique situation in which it has suspended the withdrawal 
from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "`Peace Agreement' Should Not Be Concluded Only </F>
Between the United States and North Korea"] 
  [Text] In a special briefing concerning North Korea's 
replacement of its nuclear fuel rods, Robert Gallucci, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state, suggested that discussions will be 
held for a third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks once 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are 
completed smoothly. 
  It is highly likely that when the third round of high-level 
talks are held, North Korea will propose more concrete steps in 
improving military, economic, and political relations with the 
United States which it has consistently called for in the past. 
On the other hand, the United States will demand inspections of 
both declared and undeclared nuclear facilities in North Korea 
until the international community is satisfied with their 
transparency. 
  What we must pay special attention to among the anticipated 
agenda items at the third round of U.S.-North Korea talks, is 
the issue North Korea will raise pertaining to concluding a 
peace agreement on the pretext of improving military relations 
with the United States. 
  Last month, North Korea claimed that this issue should be 
dealt with from the viewpoint of overall disarmament on the 
Korean peninsula because its undeclared nuclear sites are 
military facilities. Thus, North Korea stressed that a peace 
agreement should be concluded with the United States. 
  The proposal for concluding a peace agreement with the 
United 
States raised by North Korea in an attempt to counter special 
inspection of its undeclared nuclear facilities has been 
repeatedly put forward since the 1970's. The purpose of this 
proposal is to replace the armistice system on the Korean 
peninsula by concluding a peace agreement with the United States 
and not the ROK. This proposal is also based on the logic that 
North Korea will push for establishing the peace system on the 
Korean peninsula through disarmament between the North and the 
South and through withdrawal of U.S. Forces from South Korea on 
the basis of a North-South nonaggression declaration and the 
peace agreement with the United States. 
  This allegation of North Korea is misleading [hoguda]. The 
real parties concerned with consolidating peace on the Korean 
peninsula are none other than the North and the South. Only 
when hostile relations between the North and the South are 
turned into relations of coexistence guaranteeing the 
North-South nonaggression declaration for building legal trust 
[pobchok silloe kuchuk], when political and military trust is 
built, and disarmament between the North and the South realized, 
can a practical peace system be established on the Korean 
peninsula and can discussion of a peace agreement between the 
North and the South be held. However, the North Korean 
allegation ignores this clear, precise reality. 
  Therefore, in the wake of a third round of U.S.-North Korea 
high- level talks, our government, should closely cooperate and 
call upon the United States to clearly convey its position to 
North Korea that the peace agreement on the Korean peninsula 
should be discussed with the ROK, the party concerned, instead 
of the United States. At the same time, the United States 
should emphasize the fact that a peace agreement with the United 
States designed to force the U.S. Forces to withdraw from South 
Korea, will not result in gaining genuine peace on the Korean 
peninsula. Peace will only be gained when North Korea sincerely 
implements the building of genuine, political, legal, and 
military trust by amending its existing policies toward the 
South, and only when North Korea strives to establish peace on 
the Korean peninsula through a peace agreement between North and 
South Korea. 
  We would like to urge the government to firmly maintain the 
position that the peace agreement issue is different from the 
issue of exchanging special envoys and that the ROK people will 
never tolerate a situation in which the issue of peace on the 
Korean peninsula is discussed without participation of the ROK. 
While maintaining this position, our government should assume 
an even more positive attitude toward the ROK-U.S. mutual 
cooperative system.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Choe Won-ki: "Forecast of Third Round </F>
of U.S.-North Korea Talks -- U.S. Will Likely Accept All North 
Korean Demands If North Korean Nuclear Transparency Is Insured 
100 Percent"] 
  [Text] The North Korean nuclear train, which was dashing 
toward the edge of a cliff, is turning around in the direction 
of a safety zone with 21 May as the climax. 
  Since U.S. President Clinton stated that day that "North 
Korea's replacing of fuel rods is merely a technical violation," 
the possibility of a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks, 
which has been suspended since July last year, being held sooner 
or later, has increased. Thus, it is highly likely that 
according to this policy of Washington's, the North Korean 
nuclear problem henceforth will again go through a script for 
the "dissolution of discord" that forecasts negotiations between 
North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
based on a third round of North Korea-U.S. talks, and 
improvement in North-South relations. 
  Besides, in the event that the North Korean nuclear problem 
is resolved smoothly, relations between North Korea and the 
United States will even develop into such a level as to 
establish a liaison office in Washington and Pyongyang 
respectively during the later half of this year. Experts who 
have been watching the recent nuclear issue observed that the 
North Korean nuclear problem will proceed on the following three 
stages in accordance with a simultaneous or separate timetable. 
  The event to take place in the first stage is negotiation 
between North Korea and IAEA. 
  The IAEA will soon begin negotiations with Pyongyang over 
the 
issue of replacement, storage, and measurement of fuel rods. 
  Second is the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level 
talks. 
  In the event that additional inspection of the radiochemical 
experimental power station is carried out as a separate work 
from replacing fuel rods and sample-taking, the United States 
will view that the conditions for a third round of talks have 
been met. Taking into account the fact that additional 
inspection is being carried out satisfactorily, the possibility 
of North Korea-U.S. talks being held in early June is very great. 
  It is also likely that the third round of North Korea-U.S. 
talks will be held in Geneva between Kang Sok-chu, North Korean 
first vice foreign minister, and Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant 
secretary of state. The United States and North Korea have 
already worked out detailed political and economic issues to be 
discussed and exchanged with each other. North Korea has 
established a long-range goal of establishing diplomatic 
relations with the United States by taking advantage of recent 
developments of the situation. Under this long- range goal, 
North Korea will put forward various short-range demands for the 
improvement in mutual relations, including suspension of the 
Team Spirit joint military exercise; recognition of the North 
Korean political system; improvement in North Korea-U.S. 
relations; a promise not to launch a preemptive attack on North 
Korea; elimination of North Korea from the list of terrorist 
states, and support for a light-water reactor. 
  There is a possibility that North Korea will demand that 
these pledges be specified in a document, and will propose 
holding a Kim Il-song-Clinton summit. On other other hand, the 
United States will likely demand a guarantee for special 
inspections by the IAEA; prohibition of nuclear reprocessing; 
the resumption of North-South dialogue for the joint 
denuclearization declaration; and a complete return of North 
Korea to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. 
  It appears that the United States has finalized its position 
in conformity with the agreement with the ROK that there will be 
no serious problems in accepting North Korean demands if North 
Korea's nuclear transparency is insured 100 percent. 
  This signifies that if North Korea resolves its nuclear 
problem, the United States will implement an epoch-making policy 
on North Korea, including a long-range plan to recognize North 
Korea diplomatically . 
  This position has been expressed on many occasions by 
President Kim Yong-sam and U.S. President Clinton. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu also believes that in a 
long-range view, improvement in North Korea-U.S. relations will 
be helpful for bringing North Korea out to the international 
community. 
  The third stage is North-South relations. Experts observe 
that if the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks proceed 
smoothly, positive impact will be exerted on North-South 
relations which have been in deadlock for a long time. 
  In other words, in the event that the third round of North 
Korea- U.S. talks proceed satisfactorily, the government, which 
has been maintaining the "nuclear solution-first and economic 
cooperation-next policy" for the past two years, will highly 
likely take an appeasement gesture toward North Korea according 
to the changes in the situation, including granting permission 
to ROK businessmen to visit North Korea during the later half of 
the year. How much weight and what degree of importance North 
Korea will attach to dialogue with South Korea and to improving 
its relations with South Korea in the course of carrying out 
dialogue with the United States will decide on the speed of 
improving North Korea-U.S. relations. 
  This is because both the ROK and the United States maintain 
the position that the United States' improving its relations 
with North Korea should be carried out in parallel with 
improvement of North-South relations. 
  Professor Yi Pom-chun (Songsin Womens University) said: We 
must clearly express our strong will to North Korea and the 
United States that without implementation of ordinary and 
special inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities and 
mutual inspections between North and South of Korea in a bid to 
check North Korea's nuclear weapons development, the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and 
the United States should not be realized, nor should the United 
States' economic cooperation with North Korea be pushed for. 
  Both the ROK and the United States are attempting to make an 
appeasement approach to North Korea, stating "Let us solve the 
problem through dialogue," despite North Korea's intentional 
foul play, such as the unilateral act of replacing nuclear fuel 
rods. However, there certainly is a possibility that a solution 
to the North Korean nuclear issue may get fouled up into a more 
difficult status according to the North Korean attitude 
henceforth.

<F P=106> [By reporter An Chae-sung: "Friction Over Sausages--U.S. </F>
Plans To Notify the ROK of Super 301 Application"] 
  [Text] It has been learned that with a view to resolving 
the problem on U.S.-made sausages, whose customs clearance have 
been withheld by our government for reasons of safety, the U.S. 
Government is working out hardline measures, including the 
application of Super 301. It was also noted that the U.S. 
government, not remaining in its measures to merely solve the 
sausage issue, will raise an issue with our government's safety 
regulations on foodstuffs and quarantine system. This is 
reportedly aimed at satisfactorily exporting U.S. agricultural 
products and foodstuffs to the ROK. 
  This fact was confirmed by on 20 May a U.S. Government 
document obtained by HANGYORE SINMUN. This document is a 
summary of the contents discussed during a conference held on 26 
April by officials from the relevant U.S. Government offices and 
agencies in a bid to resolve the sausage problem. This 
conference was arranged by (Peter Collins), deputy 
representative for Asian-Pacific affairs in the Office of U.S. 
Trade Representative, and attended by relevant officials from 
the budget management bureau of the U.S. Department of State and 
Department of Agriculture. 
  According to this document, the participants in the 
conference put forward the opinion that because there was no 
progress in negotiations with the ROK Government for a solution 
to the sausage problem, the U.S. Government should notify the 
ROK Government of its plan to apply Super 301. 
  In particular, contrary to the opinion put forward by other 
participants who maintained that the ROK Government should be 
notified of the application of Super 301 this Autumn after 
watching the trend of negotiations, the relevant officials from 
the U.S. Trade Representative and U.S. Department of Agriculture 
expressed the hardline position that Super 301, their "best 
card," must be mobilized immediately. 
  Thus, this document confirms that U.S. Government officials 
are using Super 301 as a means for threatening [wihyop sudan] 
the ROK. 
  The document also revealed that a participant in the 
conference said that "the ROK is indeed afraid of Super 301. 
Therefore, Super 301 is our very weapon." 
  The document showed that the U.S. Government is handling the 
sausage problem not only as an issue related to sausage itself, 
but also as an overall issue concerning the export of U.S. 
agricultural products and foodstuffs to the ROK.

  [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government has changed a policy and now decided to allow the 
imports of codfish heads as a food, Yi Ui-su, administrator of 
the Fisheries Administration said on Friday. Yi told reporters 
that there no longer is any ground to ban the imports of codfish 
heads. 
  Noting that the United States has consistently been asking 
for their imports, the administrator said, "We have decided to 
permit codfish head imports especially because the United States 
threatens to take a trade retaliation based on Super Article 
301." 
  Yi said that early last March three food hygienic experts 
were sent to the United States to inspect codfish head 
processing. "We have determined there is no problem so far as 
hygienic matters are concerned," he said. 
  Imports of codfish heads, he said, could be made beginning 
some time in the first half of next year at the earliest because 
of the time needed in fixing domestic regulations in both 
countries to facilitate the exports and imports of the item. 
  Thirteen tons and 1,013 tons of American codfish heads were 
imported in 1983 and 1984 before their introduction was halted 
altogether in the face of public uproars that the imports of 
discarded American codfish heads as a food were prone to hurt 
people's health and national prestige.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Yu Tong-hui from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] A Western source in Beijing well versed in North 
Korean affairs said on 22 May: Kim Chong-il, North Korea's 
successor, has been completely excluded from the decisionmaking 
process in North Korea because he has been suffering from 
serious illnesses like heart disease, ever since his excessive 
pursuit of a hard-line policy toward China last year, which 
drove North Korea into a wall, and which caused him to 
eventually lose Kim Il-song's trust. 
  This source added: As a result, the inner circle of the 
North Korean leadership has been seriously discussing the issue 
of having Kim Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il's half brother, become the 
successor. 
  This source also said: During last December's party and 
government reshuffle, many of Kim Chong-il's confidants were 
relieved from their posts, and Kim Yong-chu, Kim Il-song's 
younger brother, who had disappeared from the North Korean power 
circle in the mid-seventies, reappeared. Rumors abounded at 
that time that something had happened to Kim Chong-il. However, 
the rumors abated in early March, when Kim Chong-il met with a 
General Association of Korean Residents in Japan delegation. 
However, the Kim Chong-il who appeared at that time may have 
been a "stand-in" [taeyok]. 
  This source went on to say: North Korea sent Kim Pyong-il to 
Finland as ambassador last December to soothe Kim Chong-il's 
opposition to the expulsion of his confidants from the 
leadership but called him in later. Kim Pyong-il again visited 
Pyongyang recently. This was possible because Kim Chong-il's 
power has waned significantly in a few months.

  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Pyongyang prefers Najin in 
the northeastern special economic zone to nearby Chongjin City 
for the proposed direct inter-Korean shipping route to minimize 
North Koreans' exposure to southerners, according to the Korea 
Maritime and Port Administration (KMPA). 
  "Despite the fact that several ships leased by South Korean 
shipping companies have entered Chongjin port, the North Koreans 
insist that South Korean ships use Najin port," KMPA officials 
said Monday. "We think that's a step to prevent the shock of 
opening from spreading to other places by separating the special 
economic area from other regions." 
  Chongjin has an advantage over Najin in terms of railroad 
facilities but suffers a freight vehicle shortage, while Najin 
offers better land transportation with good road conditions, the 
officials quoted ethnic Koreans living in China as saying. 
  Pyongyang seems to have designated Najin as the South-North 
direct trading center in the East Sea, the officials said. 
  Negotiations on the direct shipping route are stalled, 
however, because the North wants the Seoul government not to 
interfere in direct investment by South Korean businesses in the 
development of unloading and transportation facilities at Najin 
port, according to the officials.

<F P=106> [By reporter Kim Chung-kun from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] North Korea has begun to open the Najin-Sonbong 
special zone ahead of schedule. The opening was initially 
planned for after the nuclear problem was solved. However, 
business firms from seven Western countries, including England, 
Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, not to 
mention China, have concluded investment contracts with North 
Korea. This was confirmed on 20 May. 
  North Korea expressly stipulated in the relevant laws and 
regulations concerning the opening of the special zone that it 
would guarantee the free passage of ROK nationals and ROK cargo. 
  Besides, North Korea asked China to include 10 
representatives, from different spheres of ROK business firms 
that advanced into China, in a 50-member Chinese economic 
delegation that will visit North Korea late this month. Thus, 
North Korea was positive in inducing investment of ROK capital 
and technology. 
  According to this, the ROK Embassy in China on 20 May 
advised 
each ROK firm that advanced into China to actively prepare for 
their advance into North Korea by taking advantage of business 
collaboration with Chinese enterprises. 
  Kim Chong-u, vice chairman of the North Korean External 
Economy Commission in charge of the external opening policy, 
visited China last month. He conveyed the master plan on the 
opening of Najin- Sonbong zone to the Chinese Government, and 
asked for China's cooperation. Following this, representatives 
of the Najin-Sonbong zone exchanged a protocol with 
representatives of Hunchun City, Jilin Province, China, on 6 
April on concrete agreements between the two sides on the 
opening of the zone. 
  According to the protocol of agreement obtained by TONG-A 
ILBO, North Korea and Chinese authorities agreed to jointly 
develop the Najin-Sonbong special zone and the Hunchun-(Jiaohe) 
District in China, which is adjacent to Najin-Sonbong zone, into 
visa-free entry and tariff-free international free trade zones, 
and to conduct joint-ventures in essential facilities, including 
ports and roads. The two sides also agreed that the Chinese 
capital invested in the zones will be compensated with the 
interest earned by the operation of the zones and with marine 
products. 
  This protocol noted an additional article on the passage of 
ROK nationals and ROK cargoes into the Najin-Sonbong zone, 
stating that "South Korea is included." According to a North 
Korean source in Beijing, after the exchange of the protocol, 
the North Korean side dispatched to China Sok Hui-hyon, director 
of a department in charge of external opening, and conveyed a 
concrete plan stating that "in the event that ROK personnel from 
a China-ROK joint-venture firm wants to visit the zone, an 
invitation will be extended to him if a request is forwarded 15 
days prior to his visit so that he can travel freely to the 
zone." 
  The North Korean side has already discriminated between the 
residents who are permitted to live permanently in the 746.2 
square km special zone from those who will be sent to other 
places. North Korea moved from Pyongyang 600 new households of 
residents with a strong party spirit into this zone. Meanwhile, 
North Korea informed the Chinese side that it will allow the 
establishment of field liaison offices from seven countries, 
including China, in the Najin- Sonbong zone, and will open on a 
full scale the passage of foreigners and foreign cargoes in 
Najin and Sonbong ports starting in June, when construction of 
buildings in the wharfside is completed.

  [Text] "These days Pyongyang residents of the middle school 
age or older each carry an empty explosives satchel strapped 
around their waist, in a show of their horrifying determination 
to throw their bodies with the satchels filled with shells when 
there is a call from the leader. In addition, copies of a war 
map of South Korea with marked targets of initial attack in the 
event of war have been distributed." So said a Chinese source 
who recently visited North Korea. 
  Meanwhile, a Japanese source said, "These days a nightly 
blackout from 2100 hours is in force in Pyongyang, even in 
hotels for foreigners, turning the city into pitch darkness." 
  A Korean paper in the United States carries a similar 
report: 
"The foremost subject among taxi passengers in Seoul is, `What 
would happen if war breaks out?' There is a growing tendency 
among Korean residents in the United States to restrain their 
trips to the homeland. That is why an increasing number of them 
telephone their relatives in Korea more frequently." 
  Those are examples of the reports pouring in about the war 
atmosphere in the North and South since North Korea issued a 
threat to "turn South Korea into a sea of blood." The situation 
as described by these reports is really dreadful. However, 
interestingly enough, contrary to this reported atmosphere, 
arguments that "the war atmosphere has been concocted by tacit 
agreement between North Korea and the United States to pursue 
their own interests" have mushroomed with some credibility. 
According to this theory, the North Korean statement that it 
will "not hesitate to go to war" is hollow, and the U.S. 
"strategy of punishment" is closely linked to U.S. interests. 
  In a word, according to this theory, war cannot break out 
now. 
  The formula tacitly agreed to by North Korea and the United 
States is a win-and-win strategy. By this formula, both sides 
will win. To be more specific, by creating tension on the 
Korean Peninsula the United States seeks to sell Patriot 
missiles and other follow-up weapons, and North Korea seeks to 
settle the issue of establishing diplomatic relations with the 
United States. 
  North Korea has obstructed nuclear inspections, aborted the 
proposed exchange of special envoys between North and South, 
and used "the sea of blood" threat as a trump card at the 
formal negotiating table--all this was part of a prearranged 
strategy aimed at establishing diplomatic relations with the 
United States and even extracting U.S. economic aid. 
  If North Korea really wanted war, it would not have openly 
stated that it would "not hesitate to go to war." But it is a 
fact that Kim Chong- il, who commands nuclear diplomacy at the 
top, gained something from that threat. First, he has succeeded 
in controlling the military by placing North Korea on a quasi 
war-footing, thereby consolidating his power. Next, he has 
given the North Korean people the impression that "Kim 
Chong-il's outstanding judgment of the situation is producing 
diplomatic benefits." In addition, by causing uneasiness among 
the South Korean people, Kim Chong-il has gained the upper hand 
in diplomatic-psychological warfare. 
  Said a Korean journalist in the United States atuned to the 
North Korean situation: "North-South relations will get worse 
in late April and early May, but I think that North-South 
dialogue will be resumed in August or thereabouts as North 
Korea is expected to show an unexpected foreign policy trump 
card and make a sudden policy about-face." 
  That is the speculation about the possibility of 
"establishing diplomatic relations and exchanging ambassadors 
between North Korea and the United States in August." Various 
indications supporting this speculation are actually surfacing. 
Some of the Korean residents in the United States who recently 
visited North Korea are establishing a "prearranged channel of 
contact" with Kim Chong-il. A Korean newspaper in the United 
States has come out with a "slogan in praise of Kim Chong-il" 
on the basis of the judgment that "North Korea and the United 
States will soon establish diplomatic relations in one way or 
another." 
  As if substantiating speculation about the early 
establishment of diplomatic relations, a high-ranking U.S. 
official on 26 March hinted at the possibility of resuming 
talks between the United States and North Korea. At a press 
conference held in the United States, the senior U.S. official 
who took part in the first and second rounds of U.S.-North 
Korea talks made this point: "I cannot specify the date, but 
the United States will soon resume talks with North Korea. U.N. 
sanctions against North Korea are not a policy goal of the 
United States at all. North Korea should accept the win-and-win 
formula. North Korea has obstructed inspections in order to 
squeeze more out of the bargain. But it was a failure." 
  The creation of mutually beneficial tension by the United 
States and North Korea has something to do with Clinton's and 
Kim Chong-il's current position. Currently, Clinton is beset by 
Whitewater, which is no less troublesome than Nixon's Watergate. 
Moreover, the only way to rescue the Patriot missile maker from 
the verge of bankruptcy is to sell the missiles in the world 
market. Some point out that the party pressuring the 
manufacturer and Clinton is the Kennedy family, which has close 
ties with Clinton. 
  On the other hand, Kim Chong-il wants to be in the 
international limelight as "an able diplomat" by wresting 
diplomatic recognition from the United States and arrogate the 
credit to himself. North Korea has quietly moved to turn over 
the remains of American soldiers to the U.S. side since last 
year. In an unexpected show of generosity toward the United 
States in humanitarian matters, North Korea has already returned 
a considerable number of bodies. 
  Since the latter half of 1993, North Korea has exerted 
efforts to open up to the outside world and promote economic 
cooperation. It is worthy of note that North Korea recently 
revised the joint venture law for the first time in 10 years 
and that a move is afoot to enact a law related to foreign 
investment.

  [Excerpts] There is a plan code-named "Peace Plan." It has 
been worked out the ministries dealing with unification. A 
similar plan prepared by the Ministry of National Defense is 
called "00 Plan." 
  The "Peace Plan" spells out the government measures to cope 
with a drastic political change or an emergency situation in 
North Korea. It provides a scenario covering all possible 
contingencies, such as the sudden death of Kim Il-song, the 
outbreak of war, a military coup, food riots, mass exodus of 
North Koreans, a change in the system patterned after the 
Chinese style policy of opening up to the outside world. 
[passage omitted] 
  Because the plan was amended and supplemented for nearly 30 
years, its volume is staggering. An official said, "It takes 2 
days to skim through it." [passage omitted] 
  The "measures to cope with radical change in North Korea" 
prepared by all the ministries concerned pass as "Peace Plans." 
But the one prepared by the Defense Ministry carries a 
different name. Those prepared by the Defense Ministry are 
divided into two. The first one, "the War Plan," already 
existed. After the civilian government was installed, the 
Defense Ministry worked out the second. The Defense Ministry 
plan combining these two measures is code-named "00 Plan." 
  The scenario in the "Peace Plan" begins with changes in 
North 
Korea. There are three types of contingencies in North Korea 
foreseen by our government. They are: "the provocation of war," 
"the fall from within," and "a voluntary reform of the regime." 
  Of these contingencies, the possibility of North Korea 
invading the South is the one our government constantly keeps 
in mind. North Korea is constantly sending signals through 
various channels indicating that it will not hesitate to go to 
war. However, in our government's view, "that possibility is 
very slim." 
  In terms of combat capability, including troop strength, the 
number of combat divisions, equipment, and training, North 
Korea is slightly ahead of South Korea. In terms of "combat 
strength index" used to measure fighting capability in war 
(combat strength equivalent to one armored division is rated as 
one ED), North Korea leads South Korea by a slight margin. 
  However, according to military experts, under these 
circumstances it would be difficult for any commander with the 
power of reasonable judgment to think of launching an all-out 
war. Still, the possibility exists, although a slight one, just 
in case a special situation of political and economic confusion 
should develop in the South, undermining our government's 
ability to command war efforts, or in case North Korea should 
fall into self- abandonment. 
  Experts on unification share a similar view. According to 
them, several scenarios anticipating war have this common 
feature: "After succeeding to power, Kim Chong- il touches off 
war in an attempt to find a way out of internal difficulties, 
but he is defeated." According to these scenarios, with just one 
day for us to detect the telltale signs of a surprise attack, 
North Korean troops advance 60 to 70 kilometers in three weeks 
to occupy Seoul, but they are forced to retreat in the face of 
ROK and American counterattacks. Most experts say that as time 
goes by, the possibility of war will diminish. 
  Our intelligence authorities think that Kim Chong-il is not 
yet in complete control of the North Korean military. Proof of 
it is his constant expression of thanks to the troops in 
frontier areas. Recently, Kim appointed his trusted lieutenants 
as aides-de- camp to division commanders in the frontier areas 
north of Pyongyang, such as Wonsan, Chongjin, Kanggye, and 
Sinuiju. Reportedly, these aides, each carrying a pistol and a 
lunch box called "kwakbap" on the waist, accompany their 
division commanders for 24 hours. The Chinese government has 
already received information that North Korean division 
commanders are strongly complaining about their "kwakbap" 
aides-de-camp. It is our government's assessment that the 
possibility of war is slim at this time when Kim Chong-il is 
not in full control of the military and when it is difficult to 
look forward to Chinese and Russian support. 
  The second contingency, namely, a North Korean internal 
collapse, is subdivided into "invasion of the North by the 
South," "the collapse of the regime under a popular uprising," 
and "an anti-Kim Il-song coup." But there is no possibility 
whatsoever of the South invading the North. 
  Experts are generally negative about the possibility of "the 
collapse of the regime under a popular uprising." They give 
these reasons: North Korea is an almost completely closed 
society; the people have been brainwashed through a 
man-remaking campaign; and the regime has maintained strict 
social controls. Said Ko Yong-han, former North Korean Foreign 
Ministry official who defected to the South: "As long as the 
regime can supply only rice and red pepper to people, it will be 
able to hold on to power for the next several decades." Thus he 
ruled out a popular uprising. Our government is also skeptical 
about it. 
  However, recently the situation has changed rapidly. The 
number escaping into Russia or China is sharply increasing. 
Some point out that this phenomenon resembles what happened at 
the beginning of the fall of the East European bloc. Concerned 
ROK officials even maintain that "recent escapees should be 
regarded as refugees, not defectors." 
  Some observers predict that "if North Korea fails to tide 
over the spring famine season, riots may break out because of 
the food shortage." It is nothing new that North Korea is 
distributing for human consumption the corn or soybeans it 
imported from China as animal feed. Our government recently 
confirmed this through field reports. North Korean officials who 
contact our officials or businessmen abroad openly request food 
aid from the South. Judging from all this, there is quite 
strong speculation that the food shortage has reached its worst; 
it may touch off a popular riot. That is why quite a few 
experts predict the possibility of the regime's collapse under a 
riot. 
  The third possibility, an "anti-Kim Il-song coup," is 
thought to be high. Our government speculates that a palace coup 
by loyal followers, is a greater possibility than a military 
coup. In this connection, it is worthy of note that recently, 
there are some ominous signs of change in the situation 
surrounding Kim Chong-il. [passage omitted] 
  The scenario of the palace coup is roughly as follows: "The 
moment Kim Chong-il takes power, Kim Il-song's younger brother 
Kim Yong-chu, Kim Chong-il's stepbrother Kim Pyong-il, and Kim 
Pyong-il's mother Kim Song-ae stage a coup with military 
support and build a collective leadership hand in hand with 
Young Turks in the party and economic bureaucrats." 
  This possibility is high, but the question is whether or not 
the new regime created would be friendly to us. Speculation by 
experts on unification is that "even if a coup is successful, 
they won't present the new North Korean regime to the ROK as a 
gift." However, our government has drawn up a plan to help 
North Korea should the new forces that replaced Kim Il-song ask 
for an economic aid. 
  What worries our government most about a palace coup is a 
civil war in North Korea in case the coup should fail, and the 
resulting confusion under the reign of anarchy. It is estimated 
that in that event millions of North Koreans would escape to 
flee the civil war. Internal government data estimate the 
number of North Korean refugees at 5 million. It is expected 
that refugees would exit through these areas: the armistice 
line, the east and west coastlines, and the Chinese and Russian 
borders. According to foreign press dispatches, the Japanese 
government has drawn up a plan to block North Korean refugees 
on the high seas before they can enter Japan by boat. 
  If refugees cross the armistice line, how would our 
government handle them? Would it take them in? If North Korean 
troops massacre fleeing North Koreans, would our government sit 
back and do nothing? These are the agonizing questions. 
  In this regard, the government has drawn up special measures 
to cope with specific types of contingencies. These are the 
core of the "Peace Plan." The plan is said to have been drawn 
up on the basis of humanitarianism. This is to say it calls for 
the admittance of refugees if there are refugees. 
  The third contingency, "voluntary reform," has nothing to do 
with convulsive changes in North Korea. But voluntary reform is 
the common wish shared by our government and experts on 
unification because it is the best alternative that can 
minimize sacrifices attendant to the process of unification. 
Its shortcoming, however, is that it will take a long time to 
reach the goal of unification. This point is touched on in the 
"Peace Plan." 
  Currently, the North Korean economy is believed to be on the 
verge of ruin. North Korea will have to change course by 
necessity, not by Kim Il-song's choice. The anticipated change 
of the system will be a Chinese-style reform: establishing 
special economic zones [SEZ's] in isolated areas and reviving 
the economy, with pollution from capitalism shut out. If North 
Korea shifts to this course, the timing for the transition 
would be Kim Il-song's birthday (15 April) or shortly before. 
  Experts speculate that North Korea has completed 
preparations 
for reform. But it is trying hard to exact economic assistance 
from the United States and Japan beforehand. According to 
experts, it is out of this calculation that North Korea is 
engaged in protracted negotiations with the Clinton 
Administration over the head of the ROK Government. 
  North Korea is said to have organized a special team to 
coddle the United States. The government speculates that the 
team includes Hwang Chang-yop, who visited the SEZ's in China 
this past January, and Kim Yong-sun, former secretary in charge 
of South Korean affairs. According to a government official 
concerned, of the two Hwang is the front man and Kim has real 
power. The speculation that there will be a major change in 
North Korea has been sparked by reports about this team. 
  On the possibility of war, a senior official familiar with 
the details of the "Peace Plan" said: "It is a difficult 
question to which nobody has a ready answer, but in my personal 
opinion, the chances are minimal." He argued: "The stronger 
our stand not to hesitate to go to war, the slimmer the chances 
of the North invading the South." He speculated: "In the 
future the North-South relationship will gradually change as 
North Korea reforms on its own."

  [Text] Seoul, May 21 (YONHAP) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin sent a message to President Kim Yong-sam on Saturday to 
express his regret over the indefinite postponement of the first 
Korea-Russia joint economic committee meeting. 
  The meeting was put off after Russia abruptly cancelled the 
visit to Seoul by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin who 
was to represent Russia at the meeting slated for May 20-21. 
  In the message, Yeltsin said he was very sorry for the 
cancellation of Shokhin's visit to Seoul due to Russia's 
domestic situation. 
  Russian Ambssador to Korea Georgiy Kunadze called on Vice 
Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong to hand him the message for 
delivery to President Kim. 
  Asking for President Kim's understanding of the "unexpected 
sitaution" that kept the Russian delegation from visiting Seoul, 
Yeltsin said he was suggesting that the meeting be held in 
Moscow at an appropriate time before President Kim's planned 
visit to Moscow. 
  The Russian president also said in the message his country 
was looking forward to President Kim's visit to Moscow, which he 
said would be very useful to bilateral relations in many aspects.

  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry on 
Monday denied as "not factual" the recent claim by a British 
military expert that the discarded submarines bought by North 
Korea may be used for military purposes. 
  An article written by a British international naval forces 
expert and that appeared in the recently published "Jane's 
Warships, '94- '95," alleged that North Korea has purchased 40 
submarines from Russia and that there is the danger of the 
submarines being used for military purposes in North Korea. 
  "We have asked Russia about the claim through our consulate 
general in Vladivostok and Russian authorities said there is no 
such danger at all," a ministry official said. 
  Russia, he said, explained they had sold 12 discarded 
submarines, instead of 40 as claimed by Jane's, to North Korea, 
and only one of them has actually been delivered to Pyongyang. 
  Even this one submarine has no way but to be used as scrap 
because the Russian military had removed from the submarine all 
those parts that could be used militarily, the official said.

  [Text] Inchon, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Two South Korean fishing 
boats were seized by Chinese patrol boats with their fishermen 
aboard last month for violating the Chinese territorial waters. 
  One of the two has been set free on the condition of 
arranging the payment of a fine. A source at the Inchon Maritime 
Police said on Monday Tongwon-ho No. 61 and Tongwon-ho No. 62, 
both dragnet fishing boats based in Inchon, were seized by the 
Chinese around 3 PM April 16 while they were catching fish 
beyond the Korea-China fishery self-restraint line. 
  The Chinese, while keeping Tongwon-ho. No. 62 as hostage, 
released Tongwon-ho No. 61 on the following day, April 17, with 
the order to arrange the payment of 80,000 U.S. dollars in a 
fine. 
  The owner of the freed ship refused to pay the fine and 
Tongwon-ho No. 62 is still held in captivity in China, the 
source said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
discussed ways to reinvigorate the nation's economy with six 
former prime ministers, deputy premiers and business leader. 
  Meeting them over luncheon, President Kim said he would 
execute "clean politics" where industries will be able to manage 
their businesses without bothering to read the faces of the 
government and politicians. 
  The six elders present at the Chongwadae [presidential 
offices] working luncheon were ex-Prime Ministers Sin Hyon-hwak, 
Yu Chang-sun and Yi Hyon-chae, ex-Deputy Premiers Kim Chun-sung 
and Yi Han-bin, and Chong Su-chang, former head of the Korea 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
  The attendees called for resolute improvement of the 
economic 
structure with a view to enhancing the nation's international 
competitiveness, steady pursuit of deregulation, and preparation 
against the sudden collapse of North Korea. 
  "We should not sit idly by simply because the economy goes 
well. We must resolutely improve our economic structure through 
technology development and expanded investment," Sin Hyon-hwak 
said. 
  Former Prime Minister Nam Tok-u and ex-Deputy Premiers Sin 
Pyong-hyon and Cho Sun were also invited, but they failed to 
attend due to their overseas trips and other personal reasons.

<F P=106> [By reporter Mun Chong-u] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Actually, the relationship 
between the Kim Yong-sam Administration and the press has been 
very amicable thus far. The press occasionally voiced objection 
to appointments of certain Cabinet ministers or presidential 
secretaries, but has seldom criticized the government's 
mistakes head-on. 
  However, the government has been very high-handed toward the 
press. Around last year's Newspaper Day on 7 April President 
Kim Yong-sam and Information Minister O In-hwan urged newspaper 
companies to disclose properties owned by journalists as well 
as each paper's circulation, stressing the need for the press to 
join in the reform movement. When the slot machine scandal 
broke out last May, government sources floated the rumor that 
the government "plans to conduct a full-fledged investigation 
of those journalists who have close ties with the slot machine 
operators." In June, a CHUNGANG ILBO reporter was taken into 
custody in connection with his report concerning then Defense 
Minister Kwon Yong-hae. In July, the Office of the Prime 
Minister issued a directive calling for each ministry to 
collect information on cases of erroneous press reports and 
take active countermeasures. The press put up with this kind of 
government "interference in its internal affairs" in the past. 
But recently, some "wrinkles" have begun to be noticed in the 
relationship between the press and the government. The press 
has launched a carpet-bombing of the government in connection 
with a series of outstanding issues, such as the diversion of 
operating funds of the Sangmudae project, the cases of 
premature electioneering, the issue of North Korea's nuclear 
facilities, and the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. 
In addition, the press has heaped rebukes on President Kim 
Yong-sam's close aides by using all kinds of figures of speech 
such as "scandalous," "ignominious," and "unsightly." [passage 
omitted] 
  The government and the ruling party have nervously reacted 
to 
these rebukes. During his press conference on 31 March DLP 
Secretary General Mun Chong-su complained, "The only sectors 
that have not been reformed yet are the press and the religious 
community." Said General Secretary Mun: "Inchon Mayor Choe 
Ki-son and South Chungchong Provincial Governor Pak Tae-kwon 
are trying their best in their own ways, but the press seems to 
be mounting a political offensive against them. The press 
should show its inclination to reform by receiving normal tax 
inspections, for one thing." 
  In his congratulatory address to the 7 April Newspaper Day 
ceremony at which prizes were awarded to outstanding weekly 
papers, Vice Information Minister Yi Kyong-chae said: 
"Recently, press abuses have been the talk of the town. The 
press is dishonest in some respects, particularly in its 
operations as well as in reportage. It is self-contradictory 
for the press to call for justice while being corrupt itself." 
As concrete proof of its dishonesty, the vice minister cited 
these instances: refusal to disclose circulation; high-pressure 
advertising sales, tax evasion, and search for assets-based 
profits associated with news coverage. 
  During the 1 April meeting with a group of newspaper chief 
executives invited to the Blue House, President Kim Yong-sam 
briefed them on the results of his visit to Japan and China. 
Reportedly, the president took that opportunity to express his 
strong criticism of the press. 
  It is natural for the press to expose and criticize mistakes 
made by the government. The question, however, is whether the 
motives for criticism are pure or not. Some recent measures 
taken by the government against the press are indicative of the 
heightening tension between the government and the press. 
  The National Tax Administration on 15 March undertook a tax 
investigation of KYONGHYANG SINMUN, CHUNGANG ILBO, SEOUL 
SINMUN, HANGUK ILBO, and the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS). 
The National Tax Administration plans to conduct tax 
investigations of these four daily newspapers and the KBS for 
40 days by dispatching eight tax auditors to each of these 
companies. This is the first tax investigation of 
national-level news media in 15 years. According to reports, 
the auditors will conduct an extensive tax audit on 120 
categories, during which they will not receive even a single 
free meal from the newspaper companies being audited. The 
auditors made comments such as: "We did not know that newspaper 
companies have been managed like a hole-in- the-wall store"; or 
"Unexpectedly, there are so many questionable practices." 
Newspaper companies seem to find themselves in a very 
embarrassing position. 
  The investigations are scheduled to be finished by August. 
The press is extremely nervous about whether or not the 
National Tax Administration will make public the results. If 
they do, the press, which has remained a potential object of 
reform, is bound to experience a major impact. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, on 14 March the Board of Audit and Inspection 
uncovered the expedient assistance given to reporters in 
foreign travel by some local education offices and ordered 
corrective measures. Thus the board called a halt to the 
practice of government agencies providing assistance to 
reporters in their trips. Naturally, newspaper companies are 
unhappy about all these measures. 
  All these examples indicate that the government might have 
some ulterior motive. So far the press has been on the 
defensive over the media policy pursued by the Administration. 
The press remained silent in a show of displeasure at the 
demand for disclosing journalists' properties. However, it 
partially accepted the requests for disclosing the circulation 
figures and taking holidays off. The press has tried hard in 
its own way to show its "posture of being a participant in the 
reform drive." [passage omitted] 
  No one is more seriously aware than the authorities that 
there is something ominous in the counteroffensive of the press 
against the government. By an odd coincidence, DLP Secretary 
General Mun and Vice Information Minister Yi simultaneously 
made their remarks about conducting investigations and stopping 
tax evasion. They made these remarks because they knew by 
intuition why the press was mounting a counteroffensive against 
the government. 
  LDP Secretary General Mun said that the press and the 
religious community are the only sectors in our society that 
have not been reformed. With the turmoil of the Chogyejong 
Buddhist sector as momentum, the wind of reform is blowing over 
the religious community, and this leaves the press as the only 
institution yet to be reformed. If it is the judgment of the 
authorities that the press is mounting organized resistance 
against the government's determination to carry out reform, 
they should resolutely deal with it. 
  However, in reality, the government position is simply 
noncommittal. Concluding that a paucity of public information 
on government measures that caused a lot of unfavorable reports 
about the reform movement, the DLP has organized a public 
information committee of former journalists. This could be 
taken as a gesture of reconciliation toward the press. In fact, 
while conducting tax investigations of newspaper companies, the 
government has left some room for compromise. For one thing, 
CHOSON ILBO and TONG-A ILBO--both recorded the largest profit 
margins of all newspapers--are not included in the list of 
companies subject to the first phase of investigation. 
  In private, a certain newspaper executive candidly said: "We 
are afraid that we might become a scapegoat in the power 
struggle between newspaper owners and the government." In 
other words, as soon as the government and the press compromise 
after their sharp confrontation, only the companies' middle 
management who led the criticism of the government would 
undeservedly suffer the consequences. 
  In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that government 
measures so far against the press have been nothing but 
rhetoric. Neither the assets disclosure nor the circulation 
disclosure figures has been successful. Only the owners of some 
local newspaper companies and phoney journalists have been 
taken into custody. The present government's press policy is not 
much different from the past authoritarian regimes. 
  If the authorities are correct in their judgment that the 
press is putting up an organized resistance against it, one 
should conclude that the press sees right through government 
motives in trying to reform the press. In other words, the real 
purpose of the press policy is not reform it, but to tame it. 
This is to say that if the press stands its ground, the 
government is bound to yield to some degree. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Kim Chong-pil, chairman of 
the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, warned Monday of social 
unrest next month, citing such issues as labor-management 
disputes, the outlawed teachers' union and the parliamentary 
probe into the Sangmudae scandal. 
  Speaking at a senior party members' meeting, Kim said, 
"social unrest is expected in June whether we want it or not.... 
labor unions and campuses are restless and the matter of the 
national teachers' union, which vows to rearm itself once it is 
organized, also is uneasy." 
  Moreover, the North Korean nuclear problem poses many 
unanswered questions, although a breakthrough seems to have been 
reached, Kim said. 
  The ruling party chairman demanded that the parliamentary 
investigation into the Sangmudae scandal be concluded in a firm 
and rational way with the party floor leader playing a central 
role, expressing concern that the probe will create an uproar. 
  Kim's remarks were considered a call for the party to 
address 
domestic political issues next month when President Kim 
Young-sam pays a state visit to Russia. 
  The comments, however, also reflected ruling party 
lawmakers' 
view of the current political uneasiness arising from radical 
campus activities and labor unions striving to form a new 
national alliance, experts say.

  [Text] Okpo, May 21 (YONHAP) -- The nation's fourth 
submarine, the Pakui, was placed in commission in a launching 
ceremony held Saturday at Okpo shipyard on Koje Island with 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Adm. Kim Hong-yol, chief of naval 
operations, and Chairman Kim U-chung of the Daewoo Business 
Group attending. 
  Mrs. Kim Song-ki, wife of Minister Kim [as received], cut 
the 
ribbon for the launching of the 1,200-ton vessel in accordance 
with naval tradition. The submarine, capable of a maximum speed 
of 22 knots per hour, is twice as fast as North Korea's 
W(Whisky)- and R (Romeo)-class craft. 
  The newly built submarine, the navy said, can conduct 
independent operations for two months with 30 crew and torpedoes 
and mines aboard. The other three submarines that have already 
been launched are the Changbogo, Yichon and Choemuson. 
  With the four submarines, the South Korean Navy will be able 
to effectively protect the country's sea routes through 
utilization of a three-dimensional strategy involving the air, 
sea and submarines. 
  The Navy said the submarine's launching will serve as 
momentum to secure South Korea's marine power in the 21st 
century while providing a counterbalance against North Korean 
underseas operations. 
  The new submarine was named after Pak Ui, a Choson Dynasty 
military officer who attacked Tsushima Island where Japanese 
pirates were rampant. The Daewoo shipyard began constructing 
the diesel- propelled vessel in June 1991 with design and 
technology offered by Germany's HDW.

  [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's trade 
imbalance continued in April, recording a monthly deficit of 379 
million U.S. dollars on a customs clearance basis, the Ministry 
of Trade, Industry and Energy announced Friday. 
  The ministry said in a report that the nation's exports in 
April totaled 7,692 million U.S. dollars, a 14-percent increase 
over the same period last year, while imports reached 8,071 
million dollars, up 17.8 percent compared with April 1993. The 
deficit represents an increase of 277 million dollars over the 
same month of 1993. 
  Accordingly, trade in the first four months ran a deficit of 
3,010 million U.S. dollars on a customs clearance basis with 
27,597 million dollars in exports and 30,606 million dollars in 
imports. The trade deficit during the first four months is 1,122 
million dollars higher than in 1993. 
  April's sharp increase in imports resulted from growing 
demand for imports amid business recovery and from more raw 
materials being shipped in. In particular, imports of crude oil 
and oil-related products, which had witnessed declining demand, 
are on the rise while such capital goods as machinery, chemicals 
and textiles are showing an increase of around 20 percent. 
  Meanwhile, exports showed a sound recovery with a 
double-digit increase in products from the heavy-chemical and 
primary industries together with an 8.7-percent rise in 
light-industry goods. 
  The strong Japanese yen prompted Korea's export to increase 
in electronics and electrical goods (21.2 percent) and chemical 
products and precision machines (12 to 13 percent). 
  Korean exports to developing countries surged 17 percent 
compared with 11.2 percent to advanced countries. In contrast, 
exports to China decreased 2.3 percent due to a decline in 
Chinese demand for Korean automobiles.

  [Text] Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut yesterday 
issued a stern warning to the mass media, threatening tighter 
controls if they continue to publish or broadcast reports which 
affect innocent people. 
  The warning came amid much coverage in the press and other 
media on allegations of drug trafficking involving politicians. 
  The controversial reports were fuelled by a broadcast on 
Thursday by the radio Independent Network News (INN), which gave 
the initials of a number of politicians, government officials 
and police who were allegedly involved in the drug trade. 
  "Take it as my last request," Chawalit said. "I will not 
stand it if their reports affect innocent people again. Don't 
blame me if I take drastic action. I may ask to see the 
information before publication or broadcast." 
  Chawalit said if his warning was not heeded, his tough 
actions might start with reporters being prohibited from 
entering the Interior Ministry's compound for three days. 
  "From now on we must get tough with the mass media on their 
news presentation," Chawalit said. "If it is not true as 
reported, innocent people will be affected. This will also 
affect the credibility of the radio announcers if their reports 
are not true." 
  Chawalit said he would ensure that the affected party 
receives fair treatment in news coverage and presentation. 
  "We must deal with this problem seriously to bring about 
fair 
treatment. The mass media are not free to write anything and 
broadcast it the way they like. We must control the mass media 
to be up to standard to protect innocent people from being 
affected." 
  INN, quoting unnamed anti-narcotics officials, reported on 
Thursday that three government MPs were involved in narcotics 
trafficking. It identified them by their initials and 
positions, and said they belonged to a political party whose 
leader is the prime minister. 
  Later the agency said three opposition MPs were also 
involved 
in narcotics trafficking. Although it identified them only by 
their initials, it provided other details such as constituencies 
and party affiliations which made identification easy. 
  Senior anti-drug officials on Thursday denied INN's claim 
that staff of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) 
passed evidence of drug trafficking to the agency. 
  Speaking at a press conference at the Interior Ministry, 
Chawalit said he summoned the INN editor to question him about 
the sources of the news. 
  "He still insisted that he had received the correct 
information and had verified the information. But he refused to 
identify his sources," Chawalit said. Chawalit said he would 
like INN to apologize formally to the mentioned people to 
prevent more problems. 
  "I think the mentioned people are ready to forgive so that 
there would be no more trouble," the minister said. But, 
Chawalit said, he expected more trouble because the news agency 
insisted it had done nothing wrong. 
  Three Democrat MPs have vowed to sue INN while opposition 
members were also reported to be considering similar action. 
  A senior police official accused by the agency also 
threatened to seek damages of Bt20 million. The minister said 
he would not revive the annulled Decree 42, which once allowed 
police to shut down newspapers without seeking court orders. 
  Chawalit said many complaints had been made against the mass 
media recently. He cited a headline by SIAM POST newspaper, 
partly saying "the Parliament of duo lions on the globe" -- a 
reference to a brand of heroin -- as an example of a news report 
which affected innocent people. 
  "All parliamentarians were angry at being accused this way," 
Chawalit said. The minister said he would like the mass media 
to act with honor and credibility by not publishing untrue 
reports. 
  "I would like them to identify their sources more clearly," 
the minister said. 
  Late Thursday night, INN radio news identified more 
businessmen and politicians it alleged were involved in drug 
trafficking. INN quoted sources again quoted from the ONCB. 
This time, though, INN gave full names and surnames of the 
alleged drug traffickers.

  [Excerpt] Chat Thai Party has approved the resignation of 
Thanong Siriprichaphong, member of the House of Representatives 
from Nakhon Phanom, who is accused by the United States of being 
involved in the narcotics trade. Thanong's resignation from the 
party thus automatically terminated his membership in the House. 
  Speaking to reporters at Chat Thai Party's head office at 
noon today, Banhan Sinlapa-acha, leader of Chat Thai Party, said 
that the approval of Thanong Siriprichaphong's resignation was 
made on the recommendation of the fact-finding committee set up 
earlier by the party. However, as yet, Thanong Siriprichaphong 
is still considered innocent because the court has not yet ruled 
that he is guilty. Banhan said the drug charge against Thanong 
has caused severe damage to the country and its political 
institutions as well as to the Chat Thai Party. [passage

  [Text] Chat Phatthana MP for Chiang Rai Mongkhon 
Chongsuthamani yesterday threatened to file defamation lawsuits 
against the American Embassy and the Foreign Ministry or 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri for allegedly linking him with the 
narcotics trade. 
  Mr Mongkhon said before leaving for his home province in the 
morning that he would study what legal aspects could be used 
against those who damaged his reputation. 
  He and other Opposition MPs have been angered by reports 
that 
Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong told last week's Cabinet 
meeting that 17 Opposition MPs were suspected by the U.S. of 
involvement in illicit drug businesses and that three of them 
were denied entry visas to the US. 
  A Cabinet source quoted Sqn Ldr Prasong as naming Mr 
Mongkhon 
as one of the three MPs whose visa applications were rejected. 
  The foreign minister, however, denied that at the Cabinet 
meeting he had identified any drug suspects or those whose U.S. 
visas were refused. 
  Mr Mongkhon tearfully told the House on Thursday that he had 
never been involved in drug trafficking and had never been told 
by the United States Embassy that a visa which was issued to him 
in 1991 could not be used now. 
  The United States Information Services on Friday issued a 
statement saying there was "reason to believe" that Mr Mongkhon 
was involved in the drugs trade, therefore his visa was denied 
under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
  According to the statement, the Chiang Rai MP had been told 
in writing why he was ineligible for a visa. 
  Mr Mongkhon, however, repeatedly denied yesterday that he or 
anyone at his house had ever received such a letter from the 
embassy. There was no evidence to prove the letter had been 
sent to his house. 
  "I was surprised why that letter never reached me although I 
have my address here." 
  He asked the news media to help trace that letter for him. 
  "The news media should ask for proof (that the letter was 
sent to Mr Mongkhon) from the embassy." 
  According to Mr Mongkhon, the embassy told him the visa 
could 
not be issued because it needed a few more documents but did not 
say anything about suspected drug involvement. 
  Mr Mongkhon said he could not say whether the embassy was 
giving false evidence but wondered why the news had just been 
revealed during a time of rising conflict between the Government 
and the Opposition. 
  He said he believed the drug allegations against him were 
politically motivated, accusing the Government of trying to get 
the upper hand on the Opposition after senators and Opposition 
parties turned down its draft constitution amendment bills last 
month. 
  "The embassy should have informed me in February or March 
when the visa application was rejected. I do not understand why 
everything has just happened now," Mr Mongkhon said. 
  The Chiang Rai MP said he would hold a press conference 
after 
meeting party leader Chatchai Chunhawan today. He would also 
ask the U.S. embassy why it did not send a letter to him to 
advise that his entry visa was denied. 
  Mr Mongkhon said the fact that he used to be the secretary 
of 
former agriculture and cooperatives minister Narong Wongwan, who 
was alleged to be on the U.S. blacklist of drug suspects should 
not be relevant to the drug allegations against him. He 
challenged the Government to take legal action against him so he 
could prove he was innocent. 
  The MP, who happened to take the same flight to the northern 
province with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, said he might ask 
the premier for just treatment. 
  The Chat Phatthana Party issued a statement saying it would 
certainly take tough action against Mr Mongkhon if any criminal 
charge filed against him was proven. 
  The party said that at this stage Mr Mongkhon had not been 
charged in the U.S. or Thailand. The visa was denied on 
suspicion only.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Don't Blame the Media for MP's Alleged Drug </F>
Dealing"] 
  [Text] There were fireworks in Parliament on Thursday over 
drug allegations against MPs. 
  Several lawmakers have been suspected of involvement in drug 
trafficking. Thanong Siriprichaphong, an opposition Chat Thai 
MP, has been charged by US authorities with smuggling more than 
45 tones of marijuana into the United States between 1977 and 
1987. 
  On Tuesday, it was reported that Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri told the Cabinet that a further 17 Thai politicians had 
been blacklisted by the United States for suspected involvement 
in drugs. Of the 17 accused, he reportedly said 10 were present 
opposition lawmakers and seven former MPs. 
  Fuelling speculation further were fresh allegations made by 
the Independent Network News [INN] radio that apart from 
opposition MPs, three government lawmakers were also suspected 
of involvement in the drug trade. INN, quoting unnamed 
anti-narcotics officials, identified them only by their initials 
and positions, and said they belonged to a political party whose 
leader is the prime minister, an obvious reference to the 
Democrat Party. 
  While the government was caught offguard, INN also turned 
the 
heat on the opposition by identifying three leading opposition 
MPs alleged to be involved with illegal drugs, through their 
initials, constituencies and party affiliations. 
  Rather than initiate serious action in response to these 
allegations. Lawmakers -- both government and opposition -- 
have tended to blame the media for the controversy that only 
appears to be getting messier. 
  After angry opposition parties on Wednesday threatened to 
seek his expulsion if he failed to name the 17 suspected MPs, 
Foreign Minister Prasong apparently got cold feet and denied 
ever telling the Cabinet about the 17. Prasong said he had only 
told the Cabinet meeting that Thai people from various fields 
including the military, the police, business and politics are 
involved in drug smuggling, without naming any individuals. 
  "If anybody here wants to talk about the 17 MPs, then go and 
ask the media which publicized the issue, he said. 
  When cornered, it is easy to past the buck and blame the 
messenger for whatever consequences might arise in the pursuit 
to accurately report events to the public. 
  The fact of the matter is that the individuals implicated 
are 
not ordinary Thais. They are the people's representatives in 
Parliament -- which is supposed to be the bulwark of democracy. 
  The role of the media in Thailand, unlike in several 
neighboring countries, is to act as the public's watchdog. If 
politicians with backgrounds that indicate they have made 
fortunes illicitly have been elected as MPs, then the public has 
every right to know about it. 
  After the bloody May events in 1992, all politicians have to 
realize that democracy in the country is of the people, by the 
people and for the people, with the media playing the very 
important role safeguarding the people's interests. 
  Recent remarks made by opposition MPs that Foreign Minister 
Prasong as well as the three Democrat lawmakers should sue 
newspapers and radio stations for reporting "lies" are uncalled 
for and show the narrow-mindedness typical of many members of 
parliament. 
  When members of Parliament are implicated in 
drug-trafficking, they cannot just be viewed as isolated 
incidents because the image of the whole country is adversely 
affected. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told Parliament he would not 
hesitate to get rid of MPs if they were involved in drug 
trafficking. "It's the duty of my government to suppress all 
vice and I believe no party wants to have bad MPs," he added. 
  But these are mere words and mean nothing unless concrete 
action is taken. 
  Money laundering legislation must be introduced without 
delay 
giving authorities the right to investigate the financial status 
of drug suspects. In the world today, hard drugs like heroin 
and cocaine are killing thousands of people every year. 
Unfortunately, in Thailand it appears there are many people 
occupying positions of power who have no compunction whatsoever 
about supplying illegal drugs to foreign markets. Amassing 
wealth through such illegal means does not even prick their 
conscience. 
  For democracy to work, even on the most basic level, the 
public must be kept informed. It is the duty of the media to 
provide the information necessary to help people vote in good 
MPs to the House of Representatives. 
  The media is only trying its best to preserve the dignity of 
the House by reporting what is actually happening. In the 
broader interests of the country and salvaging Thailand's 
international reputation the media must not be prevented from 
doing so.

  [Text] Thailand and the United States are to hold a second 
round of aviation talks in Bangkok next month following the 
success of their first meeting in Washington last April, 
according to a source at the Ministry of Transport and 
Communications. 
  The meeting, which will be held at the Transport and 
Communications Ministry in the fourth week of June, is a 
positive sign, and the two countries may be able to reach a new 
aviation agreement soon, the source said. 
  "The meeting shows that this time we're getting closer to 
key 
points of the agreement, especially on seat and cargo 
capacities, but Thailand will maintain its position on the equal 
capacity principle," the source said. 
  Thailand and the U.S. aviation industry have been deadlocked 
for three years because they differ on the allocation of cabin 
and load factors. The United States supports an "open skies" 
policy while Thailand holds to the principle of "capacity 
pre-determination." 
  The Thai delegation will be led by Transport Permanent 
Secretary Mahidon Chantharangkun while the U.S. team will be 
headed by Carl Candiff the State Department's head of special 
negotiations for transport affairs. 
  The source said the United States wants to increase flights 
to Bangkok after the lifting of the embargo on Vietnam. 
Washington envisages more US tourists and businessmen 
travelling to Vietnam via Bangkok. 
  Thai Airways International [THAI] has no plans to increase 
flights to the United States in the short term. THAI flies to 
the United States four times a week on the Bangkok-Los Angeles 
route. U.S. airlines Delta, Northwest, and United Airlines 
operate a total of 21 flights a week to Bangkok. 
  Last week Thailand and Vietnam signed an aviation agreement 
to increase their seat capacities. According to the 
Director-General of the Civil Aviation Department, Dr. Sisuk 
Chantharangsu, the agreement will create a new destination for 
THAI at Danang besides Hanoi, and Ho Chi Minh, which the airline 
currently services. 
  The agreement increases the seating capacity for both 
countries from 2,350 seats per week by an additional 620 seats, 
Mr Sisuk said. 
  THAI flies to Ho Chi Minh City seven times a week and to 
Hanoi three times a week. Vietnam operates seven flights a week 
on the Hanoi-Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh-Bangkok routes.

  [Text] Thailand and Vietnam have reached a new aviation 
agreement which allows more destinations and higher seating 
capacities, according to Civil Aviation Department 
director-general Sisuk Chantharangsu. 
  Mr Sisuk led a Thai delegation to negotiate the agreement 
with the Vietnamese Civil Aviation Department in Hanoi from 
Monday to Wednesday. 
  The agreement signed on Wednesday would allow Thai Airways 
International's [THAI] aircraft to land in Danang apart from 
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh as now, he said. With an old airport 
built by the U.S. and lots of new hotels, the seaside town of 
Danang was a potential spot for tourism as it was only 100 
kilometers from the ancient town of Hue, Mr Sisuk said. THAI 
would be asked to study feasibility of traffic to Danang. 
  The route between Bangkok and Danang should be realized as 
Bangkok International Airport was the hub for as many as 72 
airlines and tourists would take only about an hour and a 
quarter to continue to Danang, he said. 
  It would take about six months for THAI and Vietnam Airline 
to study the air traffic demand between Bangkok and Danang so 
direct flights for the route could begin next year, he said. 
  The new aviation agreement also increased seating capacity 
for both countries from 2,350 seats per week by 620. 
  The increase was prompted by "high yield" traffic demand 
between Thailand and Vietnam, he said, citing as many as 200,000 
passengers travelling between Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh last year 
12.3 per cent more than the previous year. 
  Of the 620-seat increase, national airlines of the two 
countries could have an immediate increase of 120, he said. 
  THAI flew seven times a week to Ho Chi Minh and three times 
a 
week to Hanoi, he said. Vietnam operated sever flights each on 
the Hanoi-Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh-Bangkok routes.

  [Text] The South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will 
visit Vietnam this week. Our radio editor reviews Vietnam-South 
Korea relations. 
  The visit to Vietnam by South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu will further promote cooperative ties between Vietnam 
and the Republic of Korea. The event takes place nearly a year 
after the official visit to Seoul by Vietnamese Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet. It further proves that since the establishment of 
diplomatic relations in December 1992, ties between the two 
countries have significantly developed. Last year, the two-way 
trade turnover between Vietnam and South Korea was $800 million, 
an increase of 60 percent over 1992. 
  Vietnam has exported to South Korea coal, farm produce, 
textile, and sea foods; and imported from Korea electronic 
products, transport equipment and machinery. The two countries 
last year signed important agreements on investment 
encouragement and protection and trade, and aviation 
cooperation. They also initialed an agreement on avoidance of 
double taxation. 
  South Korea's investment in Vietnam has reached $530 million 
with 53 projects, an increase of 200 percent over 1992. Many 
large South Korean corporations such as Daewoo, Samsung, and 
Lucky Goldstar are undertaking major projects in Vietnam. South 
Korean investment in Vietnam diversified in area and territorial 
locations and in forms. South Korea has also granted Vietnam $50 
million in development aid to help build infrastructures. It 
has also given grant of two million U.S. dollars to Vietnam. 
  South Korea is considered the country with dynamic economic 
development in Asia and the Pacific and Vietnam is also quickly 
developing. Therefore, both countries are becoming important 
partners in the Asia-Pacific era. 
  The coming visit by the South Korean foreign minister will 
contribute to taking the bilateral relations to a higher level.

  [Text] Hanoi, May 21 (YONHAP) -- Vietnamese Foreign 
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam vowed Friday to remove obstacles to 
foreign investment including that from South Korea. 
  "It's important that we realized Vietnam has many faults in 
its investment laws," Cam said in a press conference with 
visiting South Korean reporters. "It's important that we decided 
to overcome these obstacles and provide the right conditions to 
foreign investors." 
  Cam said Hanoi, in this connection, is prepared to simplify 
entry procedures for foreign visitors. 
  The foreign minister said Vietamese-South Korean economic 
cooperation reflects what is happening all over the world -- the 
creation of one giant market in which all countries are 
interdependent. 
  "Moreover, we are located in the same region and share much 
in common in culture and history. We have very favorable 
conditions for mutually beneficial cooperation," said Cam. 
  Hanoi can learn from Seoul's experience in economic 
development and adapt the lessons to suit Vietnam's own style. 
The Vietnamese, in return, will guarantee a solid return for 
South Korean businesses in the process, he said. 
  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu concluded his 
visit to this Southeast Asian capital Friday, meeting Cam and 
President Le Duc Ahn. The two countries reaffirmed Seoul's 
promise to provide financial aid to Vietnam that will go into 
youth job training programs and many infrastructure projects. 
  On the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program, Cam 
advised patience. 
  "Our principle is that the entire world should be 
denuclearized," he said. "No matter how complicated the 
situation, one can surely find the right solution through 
patience and respect." 
  Cam declared Hanoi's unflinching commitment to socialism 
with 
a market economy. 
  "We made a grave mistake, the mistake of believing that a 
market economy can be applied only to capitalist societies. It 
was not a mistake that only we made. Other socialist nations 
made the same kind of error," he told South Korean reporters. 
  Macroeconomically, the Vietnamese Government will intervene 
to ensure balanced growth, he said. In addition, the government 
will guarantee free competition, a market based on the principle 
of supply and demand, he said. 
  He confirmed that Hanoi and Washington will soon exchange 
liaison offices, a development that is "an essential aspect in 
normalizing bilateral relations." 
  "There are so many things to be done before complete 
normalization. Just how fast they can be completed depends on 
efforts by both countries," he said.

  [Text] Vietnam, an active participant in the world trend 
for peace and cooperation, has attached great importance to 
friendship and cooperation with neighboring countries and 
nations in the Asia Pacific. This was stated by Vietnamese 
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at the international conference held 
in Singapore on opportunities for business in China, Vietnam, 
and ASEAN. Here is a review of relations between Vietnam and 
ASEAN. 
  As reported earlier, at the invitation of Singapore Prime 
Minister Goh Chok Tong, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
visited Singapore and a trade forum. Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
affirmed that Vietnam was actively preparing to become a member 
of ASEAN soon. Cooperation between Vietnam and ASEAN member 
countries has been developing in all fields especially trade. 
Two-way trade between Vietnam and ASEAN countries has increased 
annually. At the end of 1993, ASEAN invested in about 100 
projects in Vietnam with the capital of hundreds of million of 
U.S. dollar, 10 times bigger than that of 1990, and accounted 
for 10 percent of the total capital invested in Vietnam. 
  So far, nearly 30 agreements on cooperation in economy, 
trade, auditing, credit, aviation, and navigation have been 
signed between the two sides. Vietnam has also signed a large 
contract with (Primo) Company of Brunei. Many joint ventures 
are operating positively. Political ties between Vietnam and

  [Text] The ambassador of the European Union to Vietnam Mr. 
(Will Morgan) has said that the Union and Vietnam have 
potentials for development and cooperation. Here is our review 
of this relationship. 
  Last year, the 12 countries of the European Union expressed 
interest in the development of cooperation with Vietnam. The 
European community has committed 40 million U.S. dollar 
technical aid to help Vietnam develop afforestation. Last 
month, the European Union Parliament approved the signing of a 
treaty of cooperation between the EU and Vietnam. EU member 
countries then advanced the draft frame agreement for the 
discussion of cooperation and investment in Vietnam. According 
to the EU Ambassador to Vietnam, in June, EU will continue the 
discussion of the draft agreement and it might be signed in 
October this year. 
  These developments are positive signals for the development 
of economic relations between Vietnam and the EU member 
countries. 
  At present, Vietnam has a big contingent of scientists, but 
is in short of capital. Once the agreement is signed, it will 
enable the operation of the European bank in Vietnam. That 
means Vietnam can obtain loans for economic development, and at 
the same time, Vietnamese and foreign scientists have 
opportunities for cooperation. 
  Speaking with newsmen in Vietnam last week, Mr. (Will 
Morgan) 
said that the EU is expecting a long-term cooperation with 
Vietnam. The two sides will also establish an official committee 
between the EU parliament and the National Assembly of Vietnam. 
There are enough conditions for strong cooperation between 
Vietnam and the EU.

  [Text] Sengchun Salween, spokesman of the Shan State SLORC 
[State Law and Order Restoration Council], revealed that the Tai 
Yai's national liberation army under the leadership of Khun Sa 
earlier launched attacks on the strongholds of Burmese 
Government troops in all parts of the Shan State and seized from 
the government side several towns such as Mong Hsat, Kengtung, 
Mong Hsai, Doi Laem, Doi Namchang, and Mong Chot. The fighting 
between three battalions and seven companies of government 
troops and Khun Sa's army and a combined force comprising Tai 
Yai, Red Wa, Haw, and Karen ethnic groups resulted in the deaths 
of 300 of Khun Sa's soldiers and injuries to 600 others. 
Casualties on the government side were 500 killed and over 
1,000 wounded. The government sent six jet fighters to bomb 
Mong Pan, now under Khun Sa's control, but the bombing mission 
had to be canceled due to poor visibility. Moreover, Khun Sa 
has reportedly installed 10 SAM-7 missiles around Muang Jod to 
deter any attempted offensives by the government side. 
  According to the latest battle report, several government 
battalions attacked Khun Sa's strongholds and recaptured all the 
towns except the major strategic township of Mong Chot. Some 
7,000 government troops together with 1,200 porters are now 
rallying in an area north of Mong Chot on the western bank of 
the Salween River. 
  Phairot Thomat, a senior district clerk of Wiang Haeng 
District in Chiang Mai Province, disclosed that the battle 
between the Burmese Government troops and Khun Sa's army took 
place some 18 kilometers from the Thai border and the sound of 
gunfire could be heard in the district for the whole day 
yesterday. The report received by the district office confirmed 
the recapture of several towns from Khun Sa's army by the 
government side. Meanwhile, Narong Kon-athit, chief of Wiang 
Haeng District, is now inspecting and closely monitoring the 
situation along the Thai-Burmese border. 
  According to a correspondent dispatch, trade activities at 
Piang Luang market comprising 150 shops and the black market at 
Lak Taeng village in Wiang Haeng District were rather sluggish. 
Some shops reported that their daily sales were less than 300 
baht. Earlier, the amount of money circulating at the markets 
each month was formerly recorded at 30 to 40 million baht. 
  Tat Thon, chief of the Information Office of the Shan State 
SLORC, said during an interview that he had not received any 
reports on the United States planning to join the suppression 
operation against Khun Sa's army. However, he reaffirmed that 
Khun Sa's army is still capable of putting up resistance to the 
government's offensives. 
  According to a report from Government House, the issue of 
drug kingpin Khun Sa or Chang Sifu, was raised up for discussion 
during the 20 May meeting of the National Security Council, as 
it has been reported that the United States will join hands with 
the Burmese Government to launch a massive suppression operation 
against Khun Sa in the near future. The United States believes 
that the success of operation will greatly reduce the amount of 
narcotics smuggled to that country while the operation itself 
helps the Burmese Government eliminate its ethnic enemy. 
Burmese soldiers will be used during the operation while the 
U.S. side provides logistics support. 
  The meeting reportedly agreed that Thai authorities must be 
alert and impose stricter security measures along the border 
with Burma to prevent any intrusion and ensure security for Thai 
villagers in the border areas.

cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to the minister, the 
statement made by Britain indicates that the country will not do 
anything to bring about peace in Bosnia.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said there has been an improvement 
in the British media reports on Malaysia after the Malaysian 
Government banned new government contracts to British companies 
following adverse reports on the country. 
  We notice an improvement, particularly after the person 
(Andrew Neil, editor of THE SUNDAY TIMES) who started such 
reports, had been transferred, he said Sunday. 
  We will see whether his transfer will bring about a drastic 
difference in the (British media) reports, he told reporters at 
the airport after welcoming back Malaysia's badminton team which 
participated in the Thomas Cup tournament in Jakarta. Malaysia 
lost 0-3 to Indonesia. 
  Neil, 44, has been seconded to New York from next month to 
launch a current affairs programme of the Fox Television 
Network. He will be the executive editor of the new programme 
for seven months. 
  Replying to a question, Dr. Mahathir said the government 
would wait a while before deciding whether to offer contracts 
again to British firms because it wanted to ensure that the 
British media truly stopped its allegations against Malaysia.

  [Text] Singapore, May 20 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia's ban 
on British firms from bidding for government contracts cannot be 
compared with American trade policy in Asia, Deputy Prime 
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Friday. He said the Malaysian ban 
was not an attempt to impose its standards and values on the 
British. 
  Malaysia had no choice but to impose the ban because the 
country was made a victim and falsely accused of wrongdoings in 
Anglo-Malaysian trade by the British media, he said. 
  We suffer in every single decision that we made... Every 
contract awarded to the British will create problems for the 
government, for the leaders and the people, he told reporters at 
the airport here before returning to Kuala Lumpur. 
  Anwar was asked whether Malaysia's action against British 
companies could be compared to the United States' policy to link 
trade with human rights issues such as towards China.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The week-long Iranian trade exhibition in Kuala 
Lumpur is evidence that Iran is keen to establish direct trading 
links with Malaysia. This coincides with Malaysia's emphasis on 
boosting trade with South-South as well as fellow Islamic 
nations. Although Iran is an important trading partner for 
Malaysia, the trade figures have been relatively insignificant. 
In 1993, bilateral trade stood at only 310 million ringgit. 
  It is encouraging to note that the figure, though small, had 
in fact increased by 75 percent over 1992. The potential for 
increased trade is there in view that there are now more 
bilateral visits. With over 80 Iranian companies taking part in 
the expo, there is bound to be business tie-ups, possibly on a 
long-term basis. The reason for the unsatisfactory level of 
trade and investment is mainly due to the lack of information. 
This has led to trade being conducted by middlemen and other 
third parties which, inevitably, results in more expensive 
products. Through direct trade, products will be more 
competitive. The Malaysian and Iranian private sectors should 
also take stock of the economic opportunities available. There 
also needs to be more promotions like the expo. Such a trade 
display would go a long way in promoting greater awareness of 
the opportunities for importing from Iran. Another problem is 
the negative Western media coverage of Iran. As such, it is 
important Malaysian entrepreneurs find out for themselves the 
opportunities available in Iran rather than listening to third 
parties. 
  Iranian businessmen should look to invest in Malaysia in 
areas such as resource-based industries, ancillary and 
supporting industries, and the agro-based sector. It could also 
make Malaysia the gateway to the ASEAN and the larger 
Asia-Pacific market. This is where Malaysia's marketing 
experience and network of contacts can come in. 
  The two governments have put in place the necessary 
agreements to facilitate commercial relations. Malaysian 
companies have the expertise in mining, downstream processing of 
agricultural products, and mineral resource sectors. Besides 
this, Malaysians can offer their know-how in the services sector 
such as telecommunications, finance, engineering consultancy, 
construction, and infrastructure development. This ties in 
neatly with Iran's five-year development plan. 
  Malaysian investors should also take note of the immense 
opportunities in the free trade zones of the (?Kish) and Qeshum 
Islands in the southern regions of Iran. With Iran looking to 
privatize its companies and Malaysia's success in the area, 
there is much room for mutual benefit. 
  Closer Malaysian-Iranian ties are crucial in opening new 
market opportunities, especially with the emergence of powerful 
trade blocs. Iran borders seven Asian Muslim countries and six 
Arab countries on the side of the Persian Gulf, so there is a 
lot of export potential. 
  With Malaysia and Iran subscribing to free trade, a new 
chapter in greater trade and investment could very well be 
opening up between the two countries.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 20 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry (MITI) approved 240 projects 
involving an investment of RM [Ringgit Malaysia] 5,838.8 million 
(US$1: RM2.70) in the first four months of this year. 
  Minister Rafidah Aziz said Friday that the figure was an 
improvement on the 231 projects involving RM2,930.3 million for 
the same period last year. 
  Speaking at the launching of Teac's one millionth floppy 
disc 
in Batu Berendam, Melaka, 140 km to the south of here, she said, 
11 projects had investments in excess of RM100 million while 229 
had less than the amount. 
  She said 62 companies were owned by foreigners, 66 by locals 
and 109 were owned jointly, adding that by sector, electronics 
had the largest number of investors both local and foreign with 
63 projects involving RM690.08 million. 
  Rafidah also said that there were five companies nationwide 
producing floppy discs with a total annual output of 19 million 
units. 
  From this figure, 80 per cent was exported to the United 
States, Japan and Korea while the remainder was for local use.

  [Text] To His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of 
the Kingdom of Cambodia: 
  Your Majesty, we have received your message dated 22 May 
1994 
concerning the roundtable to be held next week in your 
Chhanghsu-on Palace. 
  Concerning the second and third points in your message, we 
would like to beg permission to inform Your Majesty as follows: 
  A. Concerning the second point, we would like to voice our 
support for your lofty idea on an unconditional, immediate, 
complete, lasting, and irreversible cease-fire over all 
Cambodia. We also support your lofty idea on the monitoring of 
this cease-fire by an inter-Cambodian commission to be made up 
of general and high- ranking military officers from the Khmer 
Royal Armed Forces and the Khmer Rouge group and led by two 
neutral generals representing His Majesty the King of Cambodia. 
  Moreover, we are of the opinion that as a more concrete and 
realistic move, we propose that 13 June 1994 be observed as the 
beginning of the cease-fire. 
  B. Concerning the third point, we would like to voice 
support for your lofty initiative in solemnly declaring our 
eternal allegiance to and support for a unified Cambodia without 
territorial secession [words indistinct] for national peace, 
unity, harmony, and prosperity within the framework of a joint 
endeavor to build the Cambodian nation. 
  We would like also to energetically support your noble idea 
on continuing to make enormous efforts to (?achieve a solution 
to the Cambodian problem). We will arrive in Beijing on 25 May 
to accompany Your Majesty to Chhanghsu-on Palace on 26 May. We 
would like to beg Your Majesty to grant us an audience at your 
residence in Beijing any time at your convenience. 
  May Your Majesty and the Queen enjoy Lord Buddha's blessings 
for longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and 
enlightenment. Please forgive any inappropriateness. 
  [Dated] Phnom Penh, 22 May 1994

National Assembly; Norodom Ranariddh, first prime

<F P=106> [Statement by unidentified spokesman of the party of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea issued on 20 May; place not given -- read 
by announcer] 
  [Text] I. A grenade was reportedly thrown into the 
Malaysian embassy in Phnom Penh on the night of 18 May 1994. 
The report said the grenade attack is related to the issue of 
foreign military aid to the two-headed government. 
  II. The two-headed government has accused the Khmer Rouge of 
throwing the grenade. 
  III. The spokesman of the party of Democratic Kampuchea 
[PDK] vehemently and utterly rejects the above-mentioned 
abominable and despicable accusation by the two-headed 
government, which is the out-and-out puppet and tool of the 
communist Vietnamese and the alliance of the mischievous 
superpowers with the U.S., France, and Australia as the 
ringleaders. 
  IV. The public opinion inside and outside the country, the 
Cambodian people, and people in the region have all known, 
heard, and seen clearly that the two-headed elements -- puppets 
of the communist Vietnamese and the United States -- are the 
traitors who have sold out the nation and unhesitatingly killed 
the Cambodian people. These two-headed elements are the cause 
of terror in society and of insecurity throughout Phnom Penh, 
including theft, robbery, murder, vice, the path of ruin and 
immorality, corruption, prostitution, AIDS, and so forth. 
  All these have emanated from systematic preparations, plans, 
and activities of the communist Vietnamese, communist Vietnamese 
puppets, and remnants of the evil allies. 
  V. The Cambodian people want national reconciliation and 
peace. The two-headed elements only act in contrast to what the 
people want. King Norodom Sihanouk has warned if the war dies, 
peace will survive. The answer from the two-headed elements is 
war, war, and war! After suffering serious and bitter defeats 
at Anlung Veng and Pailin with all strategic forces and all 
kinds of weapons smashed and arms, tanks, and artillery left 
behind on the battlefield, they have loudly called on their 
partners to provide arms aid to the two- headed government for 
carrying on the war to further kill the Cambodian nation and 
people. 
  The Cambodian people have gone through many tests and 
trials. 
They will definitely not allow the traitors, foreign lackeys, 
arch corrupt elements, and evil allies to suck their blood and 
rule the roost at will. The current of people's desire for 
national reconciliation and peace is enormous and mighty. By 
going against this current, all of you will definitely perish 
like salt dissolved by water and candle burned away by fire. 
  [Signed] The PDK spokesman

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Communist Vietnamese Are </F>
Again Showing Their Black Fangs To Threaten Cambodia"] 
  [Text] In a recent statement issued by their Foreign 
Ministry, the communist Vietnamese have again bared their fangs 
to threaten Cambodia and show that they are in charge as before. 
  In a statement issued by their Foreign Ministry in Hanoi, 
the 
communist Vietnamese expressed regret that the Cambodian masses 
held demonstrations in Phnom Penh to demand the expulsion of the 
nearly four million Vietnamese from Cambodia. In the same 
statement, the communist Vietnamese criticized the Cambodian 
king for saying in an interview that Vietnam has moved the 
border markers deeper into Cambodian territory. 
  Through this statement of their Foreign Ministry spokesman, 
the communist Vietnamese are baring their black fangs to coerce 
anyone in fear of them into remembering that they are the boss. 
As a result, they are able to send huge numbers of Vietnamese 
nationals into Cambodia and annex Cambodian territory, both sea 
and land, at will without any hindrance -- whether it be 
demonstrations against them or the Cambodian king [words 
indistinct]. 
  This statement also asks the Vietnamese lackeys in Phnom 
Penh 
why they have allowed the Cambodian people to hold 
demonstrations to demand the expulsion of the Vitnamese men and 
women from Cambodia and permitted the Cambodian king to give an 
interview, in which they are accused of nibbling Cambodian 
territory. It also warns them to suppress the demonstrators and 
to silence the Cambodian king. 
  You communist Vietnamese can never cow the Cambodian people. 
The Cambodian people both in the countryside and in Phnom Penh 
are rising up to deal heavy blows to your puppets and those 
puppets of the western alliance who have joined hands with you 
in killing the Cambodian nation and people. The Cambodian 
people will not stand still to let you kill them at will. For 
more than 15 years now, you black-teeth communists have invaded 
and occupied Cambodia and sowed untold destruction for the 
Cambodian nation and people. Now you are colluding with the 
western alliance in continuing to kindle the war through your 
two categories of puppets so that you can send Vietnamese men 
and women to plunder the Cambodian nation and people at will, 
thus causing untold misery to the Cambodian people. 
  The Cambodian people can no longer tolerate you. 
Accordingly, 
they will definitely not allow you to continue kindling the war 
to destroy the Cambodian nation and people. The Cambodian 
people will continue to hit you and your puppets and struggle on 
until national reconciliation and peace is achieved and every 
Cambodian can live and earn his living peacefully. 
  You call only for war, war, war; and fight, fight, fight! 
  The Cambodian people therefore have the right to hold 
demonstrations to call for peace, peace, peace and an end to 
war; and to reject the warmongers.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 22 (ANTARA) -- Visiting South Korean 
Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu here Sunday confirmed that Seoul 
is expecting Indonesia's support for its plan to apply for a UN 
Security Council [UNSC] non-permanent membership for 1996-1997. 
  "We are expecting that South Korea and Indonesia will be 
able 
to get seats at the UNSC. And we are expecting that Indonesia 
will fully support our plan," said Han on arrival at Cengkareng 
International Airport. 
  Indonesia is also planning to apply for a seat at UNSC for 
the same period. 
  The visiting minister said that his country's expectation to 
have full support from Indonesia is on the grounds that 
Indonesia as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement plays 
important roles in world affairs. 
  "Indonesia plays important roles not only in United Nations 
affairs but also in maintaining peace in the eastern Asia 
region," he stressed. He termed Indonesia's role in maintaining 
peace in the eastern Asia region crucial and helpful. Han said 
that he had also conveyed his country's expectation to other 
countries such as Thailand and Vietnam. 
  Asked about issues he would discuss with President Suharto, 
he revealed that one of the topics would be the problem of 
nuclear weapon in the Korean peninsula. 
  On the occasion, the minister also confirmed that South 
Korea's President Kim Yong-sam will attend the forthcoming Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders meeting in November 
this year in Jakarta. 
  Han is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Alatas on 
Monday and President Suharto the following day. He said that 
the two sides would discuss ways to deepen, strengthen and 
expand ties between Indonesia and South Korea. 
  Han's visit to Indonesia is the first made by a South Korean 
minister since the establishment of a civilian government in the 
northeastern Asian country in 1992.

explained that Cairo will be in charge of drafting the final 
document that is to include the first clause on the nuclear 
dispute. 
  Alatas said Indonesia, as chairman of NAM, will try to 
reflect a balanced position on the matter that is unbiased 
toward both North and South Korea and the international 
community, Yu Pyong-u, director-general of the Asian Affairs 
Bureau at the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said after the 
two-hour talks. 
  Alatas said his government will "have sympathy" for South 
Korea's bid to gain a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security 
Council, noting that Jakarta is aware of Seoul's position. South 
Korea is expected to compete with Sri Lanka for the council slot 
for 1996-97. 
  Indonesia has been the object of heavy diplomatic lobbying 
by 
North Korea, which keeps its third largest mission here with a 
staff of 25 as a base camp for Southeast Asia. 
  NAM foreign ministers meet May 31 in Cairo and the row over 
Pyongyang's nuclear program is on the agenda for the first time, 
with the final document at the end of the meeting June 3 to 
address the issue. 
  Alatas commented on the need for overall revisions to the 
makeup of the permanent membership of the Security Council, 
pointing out that all current members except China are advanced 
nations. He emphasized that developing countries should be duly 
represented as well, Yu said. 
  The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on the 
upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in 
November, to be hosted by Indonesia. 
  Alatas notified Han that the summit is slated for Nov. 15, 
preceded by a ministerial conference Nov. 11-12. Despite the 
expected changes from last year when the United States and other 
advanced nations stole the spotlight, Alatas explained his 
country plans to follow the format of last year's summit. 
  In addition, the two foreign ministers discussed prospects 
for the Malaysia-led East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), a 
sub-group within APEC that raised U.S. officials' eyebrows when 
advanced countries were excluded. 
  Alatas said the matter will be discussed fully with South 
Korea, Japan and China as well as Australia, Canada and the 
United States.

  [Text] Indonesia has welcomed the Philippine Government's 
decision to deny entry to all foreign delegates to a seminar on 
East Timor to be held in Manila. Commenting on the decision of 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos on the conference, Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas said in a press statement in Jakarta today 
that he is awaiting a formal report from the Indonesian Embassy 
in Manila on the matter. He said the conference engineered by 
Ramos Horta [leader of the Revolutionary Front for an 
Independent East Timor or Fretilin] will in fact not be an 
academic seminar on human rights but will clearly be part of 
Ramos Horta's political campaign to discredit the Indonesian 
Government. Accordingly, Alatas hoped the Philippine Government 
will cancel the planned conference as well, because this will 
reflect the common views of the two countries on the matter.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 20 (ANTARA) -- The Dutch Embassy stated 
here on Friday that its exporters had shipped containers of 
waste to Indonesia, some of them hazardous. It said its 
exporters had shipped 48 out of the 70 waste checked containers 
through the port in Rotterdam. Six of the 48 containers were 
found containing dangerous and toxic wastes while the others 
solid plastic wastes probably from households and industries. 
It denied that its exporters had shipped 14 containers to 
Indonesia through several ports in the Netherlands. 
  Based on an existing Dutch act some of the wastes manifested 
no signs of danger and therefore checks had only been made upon 
samples taken from the outer part of the containers. It also 
said the wastes had been solidified into bales so that their 
recycling process would depend much on importers' technical 
expertise. 
  An expert team from the Netherlands had been in Indonesia 
from May 2 to 19 to meet the importers and check plastic 
recycling methods in the country. This team would report the 
results of their examination to the Dutch Ministry of 
Environment for legal scrutiny to avoid any posible recurrance 
in the future.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 19 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- Research and 
Technology Minister B.J. Habibie said Thursday ASEAN amity could 
be significantly fostered by cooperation in technology and human 
resources development. He said ASEAN member countries had a 
political commitment to undertake the improvement of the quality 
of their human resources in ways compatible with "the ASEAN 
spirit." 
  The minister was speaking at a ceremony marking the signing 
of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on cooperation in various 
fields between Indonesia and Malaysia. 
  Habibie signed the document for Indonesia, while Malaysian 
Defence Minister Datuk Sri Mohamed Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak did 
the same for Malaysia. 
  Several other Indonesia-Malaysia accords were also inked at 
the ceremony. One was between the state-owned aircraft-making 
company IPTN and the Malaysian Defence Department and another 
between the Indonesian Air Force and Malaysia's Airod [company 
speciliazing in aircraft repairs and overhaul]. 
  ASEAN unity or solidarity has lately become a topic of 
public 
discussion following the emergence of a difference of views 
between Jakarta and Manila about the scheduled holding of a 
seminar on East Timor in Manila. 
  According to spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Affairs 
Ministry Irawan Abidin, the Philippine Government could not meet 
Indonesia's demand that the meeting be called off but had 
promised it would try to have the topics to be discussed at the 
proposed seminar limited. 
  Malaysia was among several countries which disagreed with 
the 
plan and said such a seminar was an effort to damage ASEAN 
friendship. 
  In response to President Suharto's statement on the 
possibility of marketing Malaysia's Proton Saga cars at 
relatively low price in Indonesia, Habibie said that it was a 
breakthrough which was expected to bring this archipelagic 
country to the technology of the future. 
  President Suharto had reportedly told Razak at a meeting 
Thursday the Malaysian cars can be sold in Indonesia, especially 
if the cars use components made in Indonesia.

  [Text] The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) 
has adopted a resolution calling for the creation of the 
next-generation cellular telephone system that makes it possible 
to use cellular telephones anywhere in the world. On 16 May, 
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Ministry [MOPT] 
decided to press the United States into putting the resolution 
into effect. The United States has adopted a policy ignoring 
the resolution, which has prompted the MOPT to make that 
decision. The MOPT plans to formally notify the U.S. side of 
its decision at the trilateral conference on cellular 
telecommunications research slated to be held in Tokyo beginning 
24 May. The conference will be attended by Japan, the United 
States, and European nations. The European Union (EU) is 
expected to cooperate with the MOPT in pressing the United 
States to put the resolution into force. 
  While present car and cellular telephones use ground 
stations 
to transmit radio waves, the next-generation mobile telephone 
system has the feature of using satellites to transmit radio 
waves. The next-generation cellular telephone system, if 
adopted worldwide, will standardize the current diverse radio 
waves used by cellular telephones. Internationally standardized 
radio waves would make it possible to use cellular telephones 
either in Japan or in other nations. 
  The resolution adopted by the ITU in 1992 also calls for 
standardizing radio waves. The ITU has urged its member nations 
to use a total of 230 mHz including 1885-2025 mHz and 2100-2200 
mHz as their exclusive radio waves for the next-generation 
cellular telephone system. President Clinton, however, has 
decided to shift part of the exclusive radio waves to the 
current cellular telephone system, incurring a backlash from 
Japan and European nations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Government Cannot Feel Relieved With the FRB's </F>
Raising of Official Discount Rate"] 
  [Text] As currency exchange markets have anticipated, the 
Federal Reserve Board [FRB], in a brief announcement on 17 May, 
said it will raise the official discount rate by 0.5 percentage 
point for the first time in five years and three months. We 
would like to applaud the raising of the key interest rate as an 
expression of the FRB's effort to fend off any inflation spiral 
and keep the dollar from further falling in value. 
  In response, dollars were supposed to be bought on the Tokyo 
Foreign Exchange Market, but they were sold instead, sending the 
dollar further down in its value against the yen. The market, 
which already anticipated a rise in the key U.S. interest rate, 
responded calmly to it. This phenomenon shows the existence of 
a long-held view that no change will occur in the trend of the 
strong yen and the weak dollar as long as Japan's huge current 
account surplus, which hit an all-time high of $130 billion in 
1993, is not reduced drastically. 
  The government cannot feel relieved because the United 
States 
has moved to halt a slide in the international value of the 
dollar by intervening in foreign exchange markets and raising 
the official discount rate. It is important for the government 
to speedily recover the economy by making further efforts to 
expand domestic demand and open the Japanese market. The Bank 
of Japan should urge banks to further lower their interest rates 
on loans by taking measures to drive down interest rates on 
financial markets. 
  The FRB decided to raise the official discount rate in line 
with the policy coordination agreed upon at the meeting of the 
G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors. 
  The currency authorities of Japan, the United States, and 
European nations intervened in foreign exchange markets to buy 
dollars in a an effort to halt a further slide in the 
international value of the dollar when the dollar fell early 
this month. With Germany and other European nations lowering 
their interest rates and the United States raising the official 
discount rate, the G-7 industrialized nations have now made it 
clear that they will intervene in currency markets to "prevent 
the dollar from further falling in value." 
  The U.S. Government, which has so far adopted the policy of 
reducing its trade deficit with Japan by promoting further 
appreciation of the yen, recently adopted a new policy of 
keeping the dollar from falling in its value against other major 
foreign currencies because of its domestic financial situation. 
  In the United States, long-term interest rates sharply rose 
for fear that the heated economy might trigger inflation, 
throwing cold water on the economy and causing a fall in the 
international value of the dollar. The weak dollar raises 
concerns over inflation and keeps the long-term interest rates 
high. If this spiral of the weak dollar and inflation continues 
unchecked, it would undermine the U.S. economy. 
  The recent raising of the official interest rate, aimed to 
shift the U.S. heated economy to a moderate one, will keep the 
recession from making a comeback although it may somewhat impede 
the economy's expansion. The U.S. economy cannot keep growing at 
a rate of 7 percent that was registered last fall as long as the 
heavy pressure from the federal budget deficit is not removed. 
  The foundation of the Clinton administration, which was 
inaugurated on a platform of giving priority to cutting the 
federal budget deficit, appears to be shaking and this concerns 
us. President Clinton's leadership is waning in the wake of the 
"Whitewater scandal" and at stake is his plan to get Congress to 
pass a bill on medical reform that holds the key to reducing the 
federal budget deficit in the long term. 
  If the U.S. Government raises the official discount rate and 
rebuilds the current fiscal structure to cut the federal budget 
deficit, this would keep the long-term interest rates at a 
stable level and help the economy grow for a long period. 
  Japan must not forget the role it must play. Japan should 
seriously work on reducing its current account surplus 
regardless of what the United States thinks. Japan will 
consistently repel pressure from the United States for 
appreciating the yen. If Japan seeks to take advantage of the 
U.S. economy's recovery to boost exports to that country for 
growth, this would backfire and only result in a further 
appreciation of the yen. 
  The Hata government was formed by political parties that 
held 
a minority in the Diet, but many opposition parties are not 
supposed to oppose promoting the deregulation. We hope that the 
Hata government will work on mapping out a set of measures to 
turn the Japanese market into a new market by opening it up to 
foreign goods and services after brushing aside resistance from 
bureaucrats and interest groups. The reform of the tax system 
aimed at perpetuating tax cuts is losing momentum. The 
discussion of how to reform the tax system should be resumed at 
the earliest date. 
  Japan is being asked to expand domestic demand speedily and 
turn the Japanese market into a world market at a time when the 
U.S. economy is decelerating and European nations are showing a 
slow economic recovery. That is the way for Japan to shore up 
the world economy and keep the yen's exchange rate stable.

  [Text] As a draft proposal for raising the consumption tax 
rate, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] has firmed up its plan to 
submit to the government's Tax System Research Council (an 
advisory organ to the prime minister) several choices centered 
on the idea of setting the tax rate at 7 percent. Since the 
council had decided to hold hearings in local cities in early 
June to explain the several choices in tax system reform, the 
MOF, which serves as the council's executive office [jimukyoku], 
mapped out the draft to be used as a base of discussion. It is 
expected that opposition parties and other organizations will 
oppose the proposal because a 7-percent tax increase is 
incorporated, as did the national welfare tax proposed by former 
Prime Minister Hosokawa. It seems that lively debate will also 
be held in the council regarding efforts to trim expenditures, 
on the assumption of increasing taxes later through 
administrative reform and as to how much a tax increase will 
improve the government's welfare services. 
  According to parties concerned, the proposal will call 
mainly 
for an increase in the consumption tax to either 1) 7 percent 
in two years; 2) 7 percent in three years; or 3) 8 percent in 
two years. These choices will be offered on the assumption that 
the government will continue to have a 5.5 trillion yen tax 
reduction even after this fiscal year by uniformly reducing 
income and resident taxes by 20 percent. Either way, the 
proposal is designed for an actual tax increase that exceeds the 
scale of tax reduction. 
  Of the choices, it seems that the one to increase the 
consumption tax to "7 percent in three years," which was a tax 
increase rate of the national welfare tax concept, will serve as 
a base of discussion at the council. However, the MOF--in 
addition to proposing the idea of increasing the consumption tax 
to 8 percent as a case for significantly increasing a source of 
revenue on the assumption that expenditures are related to 
welfare services -- is studying the possibility of submitting a 
proposal designed to increase the consumption tax rate to some 
10 percent as an example of further increasing financial 
resources. It seems that among other things, the ministry will 
explain, for each choice, how much revenue will be generated, 
how to secure a source of revenue to make up for a shortfall 
that will be created as a result of the planned tax reduction, 
and what the future financial situation will be like. 
  Under the national welfare tax concept, which was proposed 
out of the blue, only about 800 billion yen, even if inflation 
is taken into consideration, would have been allocated for 
welfare expenditures although it would have made some 3.5 
trillion yen in tax revenues after tax reduction. Because of 
this, some people criticized the concept, saying it is an idea 
far from improving the welfare system. 
  Regarding the fact that the MOF worked out these choices, a 
senior MOF official said: "A consumption tax rate of less than 
7 percent is not enough to secure financial resources to cover a 
shortfall from the tax reduction." However, it is expected that 
opposition parties and other organizations, which oppose 
increasing taxes above the 7-percent rate of the national 
welfare tax, will demand the government keep down the tax rate. 
It seems that the proposal to set the tax rate at 7 percent 
will become an actual base of discussion. 
  After explaining the proposal, the Tax System Research 
Council plans to listen to people's opinions at the local 
sessions, slated to be held on 7 and 10 June. The TSRC plans to 
reflect opinions of the people in its recommendation, which will 
be prepared by the end of June.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 21 May commentary: "No One Can Challenge Our </F>
Work To Replace the Fuel Rods"] 
  [Text] Recently, the United States and the forces that 
follow it have once again strengthened the antirepublic 
oppressive commotion by finding fault with the issue of 
replacing the fuel rods at our five-megawatt experimental 
nuclear power plant. 
  They are trying to drive the situation to an extreme 
circumstance [kuktanui sanghwang] by saying that the nuclear 
issue has entered a grave stage, that the replacement of our 
fuel rods is a grave violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] and the safeguards accord, that our issue must be 
brought to the UN Security Council and sanctions implemented, 
and so on-- because we started to replace the fuel rods. This 
is a violent distortion of the facts, and tells us that the 
United States and the forces that follow it are persistently 
maneuvering to crush our Republic. 
  The issue of replacing the fuel rods at our five-megawatt 
experimental nuclear power plant is a natural consequence 
resulting from the rupture of the DPRK-U.S. talks by the United 
States. 
  In reality, up until now the United States had used the 
DPRK-U.S. talks as a lever to realize its selfish goal by 
strengthening its pressure on us. The United States created a 
nuclear crisis and increased pressure on us inside and outside 
the talks. Also, under the cloak of modernizing the U.S. forces 
stationed in South Korea, it shoved in numerous military 
equipment into South Korea, including the Patriot missiles and 
Apache helicopters, for offensive use, obtained enormous 
economic interests, and strengthened its military presence in 
South Korea, which is a strategic point of Asia. On the other 
hand, we are receiving a grave military threat from the United 
States. 
  The third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks was ruptured, and the 
DPRK-U.S. agreement on changing the graphite-moderated reactor 
system to a light-water moderated reactor system has a long way 
to go due to the betraying act of the United States. Under this 
circumstance, we could no longer indefinitely freeze the 
operation of the graphite-moderated reactor system even by 
suffering an enormous economic loss. Therefore, it was 
inevitable for us to move toward the road of normalizing our 
peaceful nuclear activities. 
  No one can pick a quarrel with the issue of replacing the 
fuel rods at our five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant, 
even from the technology safety point of view. The fuel rods in 
the five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant were 
(?placed) in 1986. Since then we have delayed replacing the 
fuel rods until now to provide a favorable environment for the 
DPRK-U.S. talks. Today a considerable number of fuel rods have 
been damaged. In particular, due to the damage of the 
ventilator, a situation was created in which we had to stop the 
operation of the experimental atomic reactor [sihom wonjaro]. 
  As a result, a serious safety issue was presented in the 
operation of the experimental atomic reactor, and thus it became 
inevitable to take out the fuel rods immediately. 
  Out of such urgency, we sent as many as five telex messages 
to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] regarding the 
replacement of fuel rods. In the telex messages, we called on 
the IAEA to take necessary measures regarding this--such as 
being present at the scene to seal and dismantle [haechae] 
them--while informing in advance our plan on replacing the fuel 
rods. 
  In addition, we explicitly clarified that in the event the 
IAEA Secretariat did not take appropriate measures at the right 
time, we would be compelled to recognize this as an action 
showing that the IAEA has empowered us with the authority to 
break the seals at appropriate (?spots) [kuromyonso kigusogigugi 
haedanghan taechaegul chaettae chwihaji annungyongu haedang 
(?kaesoaeso) ponginul ttel kwonhanul uriege puyohangosuro 
injonghalsubakke optanungosul myongbaekhihayotta]. What is 
more, we agreed to all the IAEA's demands on the witnessing 
activities, except selective measurement of fuel rods because it 
is against our unique stance, and immediately issued visas upon 
request. However, the IAEA Secretariat unreasonably came out 
with demands tantamount to irregular inspections [pijonggi 
sacharae manmongnun yogurul murihagae tulgonawatsumyo] by 
babbling about selective preservation of fuel rods and, thus, 
rejected the witnessing, openly ignoring our unique status 
following the temporary suspension of the effectuation of the 
withdrawal from the NPT. 
  Under such circumstances, we, as a means of last concession, 
sent an emergency letter to the U.S. side writing that if our 
unique stance was settled [haesodoemyon] now by bringing the 
package deal between the DPRK and the United States to success, 
we could allow all regular and irregular [chonggimitpijonggi] 
inspections--including selective preservation of some fuel--even 
during the course of replacing the fuel rods. Nonetheless, the 
United States also rejected this proposal and did not respond to 
the talks with the DPRK. 
  Under such conditions, we could no longer delay the changing 
of fuel rods due to technical safety reasons [kisul anjongsang 
iyuro]. In view of this, the beginning of our work on replacing 
fuel rods without the presence of the IAEA Secretariat's 
inspectors was an unavoidable step entirely stemming from the 
IAEA's unreasonable acts. Such being the case, there is no 
grounds for the United States and the IAEA Secretariat to say so 
and so about our replacement of fuel rods. 
  Before picking on us, the IAEA Secretariat should reflect on 
its acts in avoiding its obligation to guarantee the normal 
nuclear activities of a member nation. It is an unbreakable 
mission of the IAEA to go to the spot for confirmation and to 
take necessary measures when an abnormal situation crops up in a 
member nation. 
  Although we requested the agency to immediately take 
appropriate measures, including a quick removal of the seals 
under unavoidable circumstances, the IAEA Secretariat avoided to 
be present during the replacement of the fuel rods for the 
reason that we refused to meet their unilateral demand of being 
allowed to choose and keep some of the replaced fuel rods. And 
it is now raising quite a row, informing the member nations of 
the agency's Board of Governors and the UN Security Council that 
we unsealed the facilities and violated the NPT. This is 
obviously a mean, conscienceless act unbecoming to an 
international organization. 
  The U.S. action is also the same. If the United States had 
responded to the DPRK-U.S. talks and brought a package deal to a 
success as demanded by us, such complicated problems existing 
now would have not even been raised from the beginning. 
  Nevertheless, the United States avoided the third round of 
the DPRK-U.S. talks, ignoring problems put forth by us and 
continuously persisting in unreasonable preconditions. 
Therefore, for the United States to make an issue of the 
replacement of our fuel rods now is the same as a thief turning 
on the master with a club. 
  In particular, some officials in the United States are 
currently stirring up the public opinion as if we were replacing 
the fuel rods to extract plutonium to produce four to five 
nuclear bombs. This is truly preposterous. 
  Unavoidably, we started the replacement of the fuel rods 
without the presence of the IAEA, but we are doing our best to 
verify that the nuclear materials are not being diverted for 
other non-peaceful purposes in the process of replacing the fuel 
rods because of the consistent will to prove the innocence of 
the peaceful nuclear activities. 
  The IAEA can never be allowed to choose and keep the fuel 
rods before our special status is brought to an end. However, 
this does not mean that the continuity of the safeguards would 
be broken. The work of replacing our fuel rods is now going on 
under the strict observation of the inspection cameras installed 
by the IAEA and as soon as the fuel rods are taken out, they are 
kept under the restriction and surveillance of the IAEA. 
  We are carrying out the work on replacing fuel rods in such 
a 
manner as to fully preserve the possibilities of measuring all 
the replaced fuel rods when the nuclear issue is resolved in a 
package deal and the partiality of the agency removed [urinun 
appro haengmunjeui ilgwaltagyoli silhyondoego kiguui 
pulgongjongsongi haesodoenun sichomegaso kyochedoen 
modunyollyobongduladaehan chukchong kanungsongul chungbunuhui 
pojonhanun panghyangeso nosimyollyojagobul chinhaenghagoitta]. 
This matter can be solved through negotiations between the DPRK 
and the IAEA. 
  Nonetheless, some forces inside the United States are trying 
to forcibly [okchiro] link our fuel rod replacement work with 
nuclear development. This can only be seen as a childish plot 
[yuchihan sulchaek] designed to find a justification to impose 
sanctions on us by deliberately aggravating the situation. At 
present, the attempt to justify its unreasonable argument with 
any wild guess or assumption can never get through. The nuclear 
issue should also seek a fair solution on the basis of the 
reality, squarely seeing the reality. 
  The United States and the IAEA Secretariat must no longer 
make mistakes in the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula but take a proper position for honestly solving the 
issue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The United States Should Respond to </F>
Peace Negotiations With Us"] 
  [Text] We recently proposed to the United States that 
negotiations be held to establish a new peace guarantee system 
to prevent arms buildup and recurrence of war, to stabilize the 
situation, and to ensure durable peace and security in a 
practical and dependable manner on the Korean peninsula. Our 
initiative toward negotiations is generating great international 
reaction, which proves that our proposal is right. 
  A state of acute military confrontation remains on the 
Korean 
peninsula. This resulted from the wrongful U.S. act of wantonly 
violating the Korean Armistice Agreement and paralyzing the 
armistice mechanism and from the U.S. policy of crushing the 
DPRK. 
  The United States has been trampling [chitpalpko] upon the 
agreements of the Armistice Agreement even more wantonly and 
following the road of reckless military confrontation and 
adventurism. Raving about countermeasures to check someone's 
nuclear development and surprise attack, hardline conservative 
forces of the United States have massively brought and deployed 
various types of equipment, including new Patriot missiles, in 
South Korea, and assembled a large-scale mobile strike armed 
forces around South Korea. The United States also says they will 
enforce the Team Spirit joint military exercise this November. 
  By this, the United States itself reveals that it has 
completely destroyed the armistice agreement it signed with us 
in the name of the United Nations with the world as witness. 
  The Korean peninsula is presently in a state of armistice. 
In order for this state to continue, the signatories of the 
armistice agreement should fulfill their obligations stipulated 
in the agreement. However, the United States is not doing so. 
The United States, in breach of its obligations stipulated in 
the Korean Armistice Agreement, has violated and trampled upon 
[pagihago yurinhaessumyo] the agreements unilaterally and 
systematically for the past 40 years, and their trampling upon 
the agreements has become more grave recently. In fact, they do 
not admit to the validity of the agreement and ignore the value 
of its existence. This is proven by the U.S. deployment of 
numerous items of combat equipment, including new-type missiles, 
into South Korea openly and in broad daylight, and its open 
actions against us, the other signatory party to the agreement. 
  Because of this wrongful act of the United States, the 
armistice Agreement has become a blank sheet of paper, and the 
situation on the Korean peninsula is becoming more grave. In 
fact, the armistice agreement has now lost its role as a 
systematic device to prevent aggravation of tension and danger 
of war. 
  Because of the U.S. maneuvers, the armistice supervisory 
mechanism has also been paralyzed. The United States 
unilaterally forced a surveillance team--which watches over the 
observance of the armistice agreement and investigates and 
clarifies violations of the agreement--out of its area in order 
to hide its violations of the armistice agreement. 
  The United States has also disabled the armistice mechanism 
from carrying out its function. The United States unilaterally 
replaced the senior member of the Military Armistice Commission 
[MAC] with a puppet army general of South Korea who is neither a 
practical party to the signing of the armistice agreement nor 
has any real power, qualification, or legal legitimacy. This 
improper act of the United States, depriving the MAC of its 
masters, turned the MAC into a nominal [yumyong musirhan] organ 
that could no longer carry out its proper role. 
  We can no longer hold out any expectations for the armistice 
agreement and the armistice mechanism--which are in name only 
and are used as a camouflage for the U.S. policy of crushing the 
DPRK. As long as the present armistice system--which stipulates 
us and the United States as the two parties to 
hostilities--continues to exist, the acute issues, including the 
nuclear issue, cannot be settled on the Korean peninsula. 
  Facts show that only when the armistice agreement is 
replaced 
by a peace agreement and a new peace guarantee system is 
established replacing the present armistice mechanism can the 
hostile relations between the DPRK and the United States be 
ended, reconciliation be achieved, and peace and security 
ensured on the Korean peninsula. 
  How the United States treats our new proposal for peace 
negotiations will be a touchstone determining whether they want 
peace or war. The United States should squarely see the nature 
and reality of the situation and respond to peace negotiations 
with us as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 20 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S. 
officials met for the second day Friday [20 May] to thrash out a 
possible deal to jump-start stalled trade talks on ways to 
increase foreign access to key Japanese markets. While 
officials put a tight lid on what went on at the meeting behind 
closed doors, there were at least indications that neither side 
has given up hope of trying to fashion an agreement. 
  "The talks are ongoing," said a Japanese official after 
emerging from three hours of talks held Friday morning at the 
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). 
  Both U.S. and Japanese officials refused to comment on 
substantive issues raised after the two sides broke off the 
morning session. The talks resumed in late afternoon, and 
another session is tentatively set for Saturday. The 
negotiations to revive the so-called "framework" trade talks 
have been closely watched on financial markets as a barometer in 
the state of the relationship between the world's two largest 
economies. 
  Reflecting the sensitivity of the negotiations, two Japanese 
principals involved in the negotiations -- Vice Minister of 
International Trade and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu and Deputy 
Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi -- slipped off after the 
morning session without being noticed by a group of reporters 
staking out the main entrance of the USTR office. 
  Like their Japanese counterparts, U.S. officials involved in 
the talks were equally tight-lipped. 
  "You know I can't talk," said a U. S. official when asked 
for 
comment. 
  One senior U.S. negotiator involved in the talks, however, 
sought to project an air of conviviality. 
  "We had a good and cordial conversation, and we will meet 
again," said Bowman Cutter, deputy director of the Presidential 
National Economic Council. 
  The trade talks, based on a "framework" accord the two 
countries concluded in July last year, ruptured in February at a 
meeting in Washington between President Bill Clinton and then 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
who succeeded Hosokawa in late April, and Clinton agreed last 
week to work out a common "basis" for restarting the framework 
talks before they meet at the group seven summit in Naples in 
early July. 
  One major sticking point in the framework talks -- and the 
primary cause for the rupture of the negotiations at the Feb. 11 
U.S.-Japan summit -- is the idea of setting "objective criteria" 
to measure imports to Japan. In what is known as a 
"results-oriented" approach, the U.S. has insisted using 
"numerical indicators" to ensure that a trade agreement with 
Japan translates into increased foreign sales in the Japanese 
market. 
  Tokyo has strongly objected to the idea, saying it amounts 
to 
government-managed trade. 
  Among the industry sectors covered under the "framework" 
accord are Japanese Government procurement for medical and 
telecommunications products, trade in autos and auto parts and 
the Japanese insurance market. 
  The U.S. wants Japan to open its market wider to foreign 
goods and stimulate domestic demand in order to reduce its vast, 
and growing, trade surplus. The U.S.-Japan trade imbalance was 
underscored by fresh U.S. Government data Thursday that showed 
the U.S. trade deficit with Japan jumped 25 percent in March to 
5.80 billion dollars. The U.S. trade gap with Japan came to 
15.04 billion dollars in the first three months of this year, 
well ahead of the comparable period last year which stood at 
13.3 billion dollars.

  [Text] The government released a statement today, through a 
National Unification Board spokesman, pertaining to the demand 
made by North Korea for the repatriation of the loggers who 
defected. The government statement stressed that their defection 
was done legally from the humanitarian standpoint, and urged 
North Korea to immediately stop carrying out acts that heighten 
tension on the Korean peninsula by raising a row on this 
defection. 
  The government pointed out that the loggers, who defected 
recently, came to our side voluntarily, seeking their freedom 
and welfare. However, North Korea claimed that they had been 
abducted and so forth. This is totally groundless. Thus, the 
government called on North Korea to stop committing 
irresponsible acts. 
  Earlier today, North Korea sent a telephone message in the 
name of Yi Song-tok, head of the North Korean side's office of 
the North- South Liaison Office, claiming that the ROK forcibly 
abducted and kidnapped the loggers. North Korea urged the South 
to unconditionally repatriate them to North Korea. 
  Threatening that if the ROK fails to repatriate the loggers, 
grave consequences would be brought about to the overall 
North-South relations, North Korea claimed that the ROK would be 
held responsible for all consequences arising therefrom.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told Parliament 
yesterday some MPs were suspected of involvement in drug deals 
and he vowed to get rid of them. He said he had a list of 
suspected drug dealing politicians, including MPs and provincial 
and local politicians, but declined to reveal who or how many 
there were. 
  Mr Chuan said the list was not updated and those who had 
been 
in previous governments for the past several years would know as 
much as he did. But the list of suspected drug dealing 
politicians was not provided by Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri, according to the Premier. 
  The Premier pledged to take action against all drug dealers 
no matter if they were MPs or other politicians. 
  "Don't ask who they are or how many. That's useless. We 
don't have any evidence to pin them down. We only have 
suspicions." 
  Mr Chuan said he did not have any evidence which could lead 
to the arrests of any MPs and disclosure of their names would 
not be of any help. 
  "It's the duty of my Government to suppress all vice and I 
believe no party wants to have bad MPs." 
  But the Premier did not confirm or deny news reports that 
Sqn 
Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong had claimed in a Cabinet meeting 
on Tuesday that 17 MPs were allegedly drug dealers. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong dismissed the reports during his testimony 
before the House Committee for Parliamentary Affairs as well as 
during the full House meeting yesterday. The minister said he 
was doing the right thing for the prestige of Parliament and the 
country. 
  "It's a shame on us all. If you wore a bucket to hide your 
face, I would wear a bucket to hide my face, too," he said 
referring to drug claims against MPs. Mr Chuan said Cabinet 
meetings were supposed to be secret but admitted it was his 
Government's fault some information was leaked to the press. 
  Chat Phatthana MP Sophon Phetsawang and a few other MPs 
insisted the Premier tell the House whether or not Sqn Ldr 
Prasong had made such a claim during the weekly Cabinet meeting. 
  The Premier said the foreign minister had shown documents 
provided by United States authorities through the US Embassy in 
Bangkok on allegations that Chat Thai MP Thanong Siriprichaphong 
and Chat Phatthana MP Mongkhon Chongsuthamani had been involved 
in drug deals. 
  The US authorities seized Mr Thanong's home and car in 
California, lodged criminal charges against the Chat Thai MP for 
his alleged marijuana smuggling and revoked in March a visa for 
Mr Mongkhon, also suspected of having dealt in drugs. The 
foreign minister reported this to the Cabinet, Mr Chuan said. 
  Mr Thanong was suspected to be a marijuana smuggler between 
1977 and 1987, the period during which he was not a Chat Thai 
MP, but the information pertaining to the claims was only 
recently exposed to the press, according to Mr Chuan. He did 
not think there was any conspiracy outside Parliament which 
might want to sabotage the House; only some MPs who might want 
to discredit other MPs or tarnish the entire House. 
  "I don't think there is any conspiracy. It's only among us. 
Don't blame anybody else." 
  His comment followed several MPs' claim that drug dealing 
charges against the 17 MPs might have been made as part of a 
conspiracy outside Parliament aimed at destroying the entire 
House. 
  Mr Chuan dismissed criticism that drugs claims surrounding 
the Opposition MPs were designed to pre-empt a no-confidence 
motion the Opposition had planned to launch against his 
Government.

  [Text] Hanoi, May 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu, confirming that the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has proposed negotiations to North Korea on 
inspecting the refueling process at the 5-megawatt reactor in 
Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, said Friday that the next round of 
North Korea-U.S. high-level talks may be held next month. 
  "The immediate task right now is to stop North Korea from 
further discharging fuel rods from its reactor and to 
successfully conclude negotiations with the IAEA," said Han here 
in the middle of his Asian tour. 
  "The North Korea-U.S. high-level dialogue remains a 
possibility, assuming that these two conditions are met," Han 
said. 
  "The situation is neither optimistic nor pessimistic," said 
Han cautiously. 
  But other officials predicted that North Korea-U.S. dialogue 
will likely open next month if Pyongyang agrees to stop changing 
the rods until an inspection accord is reached with the IAEA. 
In a long-awaited breakthrough that could well crack the 
nuclear impasse, the IAEA proposed sending a team to North Korea 
to negotiate the agency's presence and safeguards activities 
related to the rod discharge operation. 
  "North Korea had proposed earlier that it and the IAEA 
discuss the matter. The IAEA has, in a sense, accepted this 
proposal after judging that safeguards at the 5-megawatt reactor 
have not been broken yet," Han told reporters. 
  An IAEA monitoring team arrived in North Korea May 17 for a 
week- long inspection. The inspectors' main task was to 
determine whether North Korea had indeed started removing fuel 
rods from the 5- megawatt reactor and, if so, how many. 
  The agency's press release stated that "core discharge has 
indeed started." 
  The inspection team reported on the extent of the discharge, 
"and as of today, it still seems possible to implement the 
required safeguards measures," the IAEA said. 
  "In view of the above, the agency proposed sending a team of 
officials immediately to (North Korea)" to discuss necessary 
safeguards measures.

  [Text] Today, in a commentary in the name of Chang Ki-ho, 
a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the government 
expressed regret and worry over the fact that it has been 
confirmed that North Korea has begun replacing fuels at the 5-mw 
atomic reactor. 
  The government also urged North Korea to fulfill its duty of 
implementing safety measures in connection with the replacement 
of fuels at the 5-megawatt atomic reactor through immediate 
negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
which says that there remains the possibility of the 
implementation of safety measures if North Korea no longer 
pushes ahead with replacing fuels. 
  The government also made it clear that it will work out 
further countermeasures through close consultations with 
friendly countries, while watching the results of negotiations 
between the IAEA and North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- The government decided 
Friday to consider asking the United National Security Council 
to take additional action should North Korea reject the IAEA's 
[International Atomic Energy Agency] proposal to suspend the 
changing of fuel rods at a 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon and 
permit complete inspections. 
  The government held a unification and security policy 
coordination meeting attended by Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime 
minister and National Unification Board [NUB] minister, and 
other related ministers to discuss North Korea's replacement of 
fuel rods. 
  At the meeting held at the South-North dialogue office, the 
ministers also decided to strengthen cooperation with related 
countries, including the United States, in trying to solve the 
nuclear problem. 
  The government determined that North Korea's removal of 
spent 
fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor is a serious violation of 
IAEA nuclear safeguards. 
  The United Nations' nuclear watchdog Thursday warned 
Pyongyang that if it continued to replace spent fuel rods at the 
5-megawatt reactor, the case would be reported to the United 
Nations Security Council and the IAEA Board of Governors. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency also proposed to send 
a team to Pyongyang soon to negotiate inspection of the 
refueling process at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor. But the 
ministers agreed to draw up detailed countermeasures after 
determining North Korea's attitude, considering that settlement 
of the nuclear problem through negotiation is still possible. 
Deputy Prime Minister Yi was quoted as saying, "we still cannot 
say that the prospect for settlement of the North Korean nuclear 
problem is totally pessimistic. The IAEA expressed its position 
to Pyongyang, and now what is important is North Korea's choice." 
  NUB spokesman Kim Hyong-ki said, "we expect that North Korea 
will respond to the IAEA proposal soon. And we will decide ways 
to cope with the problem as soon as North Korea announces its 
answer." 
  A senior government official expected that if North Korea 
reacts negatively to the IAEA proposal, the government will have 
to consult the United States on asking the UN Security Council 
to take additional action against North Korea.

  [Text] Mr. Kim Tae-ho, a worker at a North Korean uranium 
processing plant, who defected to the ROK on 7 May, revealed 
that the Workers Party's second economic committee under the 
direct control of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, had been 
carrying out nuclear development with massive capital 
investment, and that North Korea had extracted 12 kg of 
plutonium in 1988. Mr. Kim gave an interview to YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
today in Seoul. 
  He also said: While the Atomic Energy Ministry [wonjaryok 
kongoppu] appears to be in charge of North Korea's nuclear 
development, in reality, Secretary Chon Pyong-ho of the Workers 
Party's second economic committee, is in charge of nuclear 
development at the instruction of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. 
  Mr. Kim Tae-ho also said that many researcher friends had 
told him that North Korea extracted 12 kg of plutonium for the 
first time in the summer of 1988 by using the spent fuel at the 
5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and that the amount is 
enough to produce two nuclear bombs. 
  Mr. Kim also said that there was a coup attempt in the 
military last year, and that all involved, were arrested.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 (YONHAP) -- The 2nd economic committee 
of the Worker's (Nodong) Party, which is directly controlled by 
North Korean leader Kim Il-song and his son, Chong-il, is 
managing Pyongyang's nuclear development through enormous 
expenditures, a former North Korean worker at a uranium 
refinery, who defected to the South early this month, told a 
Japanese vernacular newspaper Friday. 
  "North Korea succeeded in extracting 12 kilograms of 
plutonium in 1988," 35-year-old Kim Tae-ho said in Seoul in an 
interview with the YOMIURI SHIMBUN. 
  On the surface, North Korea's nuclear program is seemingly 
under the control of the Atomic Energy Industry Ministry, but in 
fact it is managed by party Secretary Chon Pyong-ho, chief of 
the 2nd Economic Committee, Kim said. 
  The 2nd Economic Committee commands the logistics and atomic 
energy industries and the nuclear program is managed by its 
subordinate agency, called the 5th General Machinery Industry 
Bureau, he said. 
  All facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear complex are 
administered by the 5th Machinery Industry General Bureau and 
Economic Committee Chief Chon are operating them under direct 
instructions from Kim Il- song and his son. 
  Saying he had heard stories from several of his friends 
working as nuclear researchers, Kim told the YOMIURI that North 
Korea first succeeded in withdrawing plutonium from spent fuel 
in the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in the summer of 
1988. 
  "Kim Il-song and his son were so happy that they went down 
to 
the reactor and gave each of the researchers and engineers a 
color television receiver," he said. 
  The extracted plutonium was estimated to weigh 12 kilograms, 
sufficient to produce two nuclear bombs, Kim pointed out. "In 
light of North Korea's technology, they (North Koreans) have yet 
to produce nuclear bombs, but I think they are near completion, 
he said. 
  He said a military coup was attempted in a bid to overthrow 
the Kim Il-song regime early last year. It was led by Vice 
Marshal Kim Pong-yul and several generals who studied in the 
former Soviet Union. They were all captured after their coup 
plan was blocked by Army General Political Bureau Director Yi 
Pong-won, Kim said. 
  Before fleeing to South Korea, Kim worked at a uranium 
refinery in Pyongsan, North Hwanghae Province, which sends ore 
to a processing factory in Yongbyon. The ore is known to be 
processed into fuel rods for use at nuclear reactors.

  [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- Chairman Kim Tae-chung of 
the Peace Foundation for the Asia-Pacific Region has dismissed 
as "totally groundless" domestic reports that, in an interview 
with THE WASHINGTON TIMES, he said North Korea's possession of 
two or three nuclear weapons would pose no problem. 
  In a statement released through the foundation here Thursday 
[19 May], Kim expressed regret at the incorrect reporting on his 
interview with the U.S. newspaper and asked South Koreans not to 
misunderstand him. 
  "I have persistently said North Korea's nuclear ambitions 
must be completely done away with in tens of lectures, meetings 
and interviews that I have had since my arrival in the United 
States, " he said. 
  THE WASHINGTON TIMES' story contained none of his remarks' 
true meaning, he stressed. 
  On his comments regarding a visit to the United States by 
North Korean President Kim Il-song, he said he had never 
proposed that President Bill Clinton invite Kim to visit 
Washington. "But I have said that I strongly believe Kim's 
participation in a U.N. General Assembly session as the head of 
state of a member nation would have the positive effect of 
solving the North Korean nuclear issue, promoting inter-Korean 
cooperation and easing tension on the Korean peninsula," he 
added. 
  Free discussion of various topics related to national 
unification will help the government forge a unification policy 
on the basis of a national consensus, he said, noting that all 
programs derived from such a policy must be carried out solely 
by the government.

  [Text] Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae this morning held a 
telephone conversation with U.S. Defense Secretary William 
Perry, and discussed pending military issues between the two 
countries. 
  The telephone conversation between defense ministers of the 
ROK and the United States this morning was held in accordance 
with the mutual agreement on establishing a hotline, reached 
when Secretary Perry visited the ROK last month so that various 
pending military issues between the ROK and the United States 
can be discussed at all times. The conversation this time is 
the first occasion. 
  In a 20-minute conversation with Secretary Perry this 
morning, Minister Yi discussed the North Korean nuclear 
situation, inspections of which are underway. The two ministers 
agreed to continue close cooperation in dealing with North 
Korean nuclear issue. 
  The two ministers also exchanged views on matters of common 
interest between the two countries concerning security, 
including the North Korean side's recent withdrawal of its 
members from the Armistice Commission in Panmunjom, and its 
proposal for concluding a peace agreement. 
  The two ministers agreed to exchange views on important 
defense issues at all times in the future through a hotline, and 
thus to consolidate the military cooperation between the two 
countries.

in Korea (USFK) Thursday [19 May] launched a three-day defense 
readiness drill involving USFK dependents and American civilians 
residing in the country, a spokesman for the Korea-U.S. Combined 
Forces Command (CFC) said. 
  The semi-annual drill called Non-combatant Evacuation 
Operation (NEO) will include the checking of manpower, paperwork 
and the operation to evacuate non-combatants in the event of war 
on the Korean peninsula, the spokesman said. 
  The spokesman added, "the drill is just part of the routine 
semiannual program having nothing to do with the current 
situation in which tension has escalated due to the standoff 
involving Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program."

<F P=106> [Second of two-part article by staff reporter Sim Chae-yun] </F>
  [Text] Another controversial point with regard to the SOFA 
[Status of Forces Agreement] is the allegation that the 
bilateral pact has provided the USFK servicemen and their 
dependent relatives in Korea with too much preferential 
treatment especially in connection with customs duties and use 
of military facilities. 
  So far, the SOFA problems have been neglected to some 
extent, 
over-shadowed by the pressing need to deal with the "biased" 
pact concerning the U.S. criminal suspects. 
  The agreement virtually enables civilian components and the 
their dependents to enter and depart the country with no limit 
if they carry appropriate documents issued by the U.S. 
authorities without undergoing formalities in accordance with 
the (Korean) Immigration Control Law, said Prof. Yi Chang-hui of 
the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. 
  This is in sharp contrast with a pact between the U.S. and 
NATO treaty countries, requiring the families of military 
personnel to adhere to the relevant domestic laws without any 
preferential treatment, Yi said. 
  What is more problematic is that the U.S. military 
servicemen 
and their families' entry of materials, supplies and equipment 
are free from custom duties and other such charges. They only 
have to bring appropriate certifications issued by the USFK 
according to a provision of Article 9. 
  In NATO nations, they need to take necessary procedures as 
demanded on civilians through airports in general. 
  "In part, it is understandable to offer privileges to the 
USFK personnel and their dependents taking into account the 
specific security situation and the urgent need for joint 
defense," said Yi. 
  "But what matters is that the SOFA acknowledges too many 
favors and exceptions," he added. 
  Some military personnel and their families are suspected of 
engaging in smuggling, thus disturbing local market order in 
Korea, taking advantage of loopholes in our tax system, an 
official of the National Campaign for Eradication of Crime by 
U.S. Troops in Korea alleged yesterday. "Some USFK personnel 
carry in goods like electric appliances from Japan and Hong Kong 
for commercial purposes after spending holidays there," he 
alleged. 
  Prof. Yi also claims the U.S. military and convenience 
facilities located outside military camps should controlled 
under the relevant regulations and laws of Korea. 
  Some radical activists even go so far as to argue that the 
United States should pay for the USFK's use of facilities in 
Korea. 
  The Defense Ministry maintains a cautious attitude on their 
demand, saying, "The matter should be considered seriously." 
  "We need pay heed of the specific security situation," a 
ministry official in charge of U.S. relations said. 
  But he emphasized the need to revise the SOFA as far as the 
matter of dealing with the U.S. criminal suspects is concerned. 
"The agreement should be developed in a desirable direction," he 
said. 
  The Foreign Ministry also recognizes the necessity to 
rewrite 
the SOFA in relation with judiciary rights. "What needs review 
in the SOFA is the one related to jurisdiction," he said. 
  "But it does not necessarily mean that we will start 
negotiation right now," he added.

  [Text] It has been learned on 18 May that the government 
has decided to allow U.S. motor companies to establish joint 
ventures for financing installments sales in the ROK within this 
year. Accordingly, U.S. motor companies, including Ford, will be 
able to sell cars in installments through their own financing 
companies from 1995. 
  The government policy is a partial acceptance of U.S. 
pressure to allow U.S. companies to establish installments 
financing companies on the grounds that not allowing the 
participation of U.S. companies in the establishment of domestic 
installments financing companies is discriminatory and a 
violation of the provision requiring foreign companies to be 
given equal treatment as domestic companies. The government 
previously decided to allow ROK companies to establish 
installments financing companies in the first half of this year. 
  A relevant government official revealed that as the U.S. 
demand has emerged as a core subject of the trade dispute 
between the two countries, the government has decided to 
partially accept the U.S. position by allowing the establishment 
of installments financing companies by ROK companies first and 
later by U.S. companies after a certain period. The ROK 
Government notified the U.S. Government of the policy towards 
the end of April in trade talks. 
  The official said, however, that the government policy would 
not allow for 100-percent ownership by U.S. companies, but only 
investment amounting to 49 percent in a joint venture with ROK 
companies. 
  Ford Motors has reportedly led the demand for the 
establishment of installments financing companies in the ROK by 
U.S. companies.

  [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The Fair Trade Commission 
is investigating a Korean sales agency's complaint of unfair 
business practices against the U.S.-based multinational rubber 
and tire firm, Goodyear. 
  The government agency under the Economic Planning Board, 
whose ruling carries binding force, will announce a decision by 
the end of this month. 
  Pusan-based Daeyang Corp. filed a complaint against Goodyear 
Korea last February, charging the American company with ceasing 
to supply goods after the former refused to pay a large 
honorarium and unilaterally breaking off their contract. 
  According to Daeyang's statement, Goodyear Korea demanded 50 
million won for letting the provincial company open sales 
outlets in Pusan and South Kyongsan Province. 
  When it refused, Goodyear stopped supplying products and 
terminated its contract with Daeyang. 
  Goodyear Korea flatly denied Daeyang's charges, saying the 
demand for an honorarium concerned just one of its salesmen who 
has already been sacked over the matter. 
  It explained that Daeyang had failed to submit orders and 
present a business blueprint, a requirement under the contract, 
as reasons for breaking ties. 
  The rights and wrongs will be determined by the Fair Trade 
Commission later in the month, but industry observers say the 
case sends a warning to Korean businesses vying to sell foreign 
brands.

<F P=106> [Article by Pak Chong-mun] </F>
  [Text] On the afternoon of 18 May, five North Korean 
loggers arrived in the ROK for the first time since the 
government decided to accept North Korean loggers escaping from 
North Korean logging camps in Siberia from a humanitarian 
standpoint. 
  We cannot deny the fact that our government's diplomatic 
efforts and public opinion calling for quick action for our 
fellow countrymen were important factors in their arrival in the 
ROK. 
  All facts surrounding the defection of the five North 
Koreans, including Mr. Choe Chong-nam, have been kept secret. 
Therefore, it has been pointed out that intelligence agencies 
may have been involved in this case to an excessive degree. 
  The government stated they defected to the ROK through 
legitimate procedures. Still, it has kept everything secret 
merely at the requests of countries involved. The 
reasonableness of this secrecy has been questioned. 
  The government stated it would arrange a news conference 
with 
the five defectors when a proper method is agreed upon. 
  It has been learned that the five loggers have not received 
the right of residence or Russian citizenship, which Russia 
gives to loggers who flee their camps. Therefore, it is 
believed that, as a result of our government's diplomatic 
efforts, they received travel permits from Russia, Kazakhstan, 
or any other country where they had stayed and came to the ROK 
through a third country. 
  This method is completely different from the way the ROK 
proposed to Russia: We proposed that the loggers be repatriated 
to the ROK through the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 
Russia's proposal that Russia and the ROK independently resolve 
this issue through bilateral negotiations has been implemented. 
It is very burdensome to the ROK and Russia to have bilateral 
negotiations to settle this issue. 
  North Korea has shown great resistance several times to the 
South's Government alleged policy of accepting the loggers as 
defectors, saying: "If they take loggers to the South, we will 
regard it as kidnapping." It has been learned that North Korea 
has also called on Russia, on the basis of the treaty on 
cooperation in judiciary matters, to apprehend some 40 escaped 
loggers. The fact that the government has accepted five loggers 
immediately after it has made a decision gives the impression it 
has been excessively hasty to show off its achievements. There 
are some circles calling for self-examination as to whether the 
government paid a cost that we would not have had to pay if the 
matter was handled in a reasonable way. 
  In fact, the government has not mapped out any practical 
measures for procedures to smoothly accept and settle North 
Korean loggers in our country. Discussions have been made on 
whether to provide them with 40 million to 50 million won per 
person for resettlement by applying the `Law on Protecting North 
Korean Compatriots Who Have Defected to the South'; whether to 
enact a new law; or how to give them vocational training. No 
decision has yet been made. So far, about 600 people have 
defected from North Korea for resettlement in the South. It has 
been learned that in some cases, they have not received 
resettlement funds due to lack of money, or in many cases, they 
have become `aliens' because they have failed to readjust. 
  In view of this situation, some circles point out that 
instead of accepting North Korean loggers without prior 
arrangements, it is necessary to make swift preparations for 
them to help them adjust to a new free world and to live a life 
worthy of a human being.

  [Text] The ROK Government has mapped a plan to build a 
North-South expressway network linking Seoul and Pyongyang and 
Seoul and Wonsan in preparations for the North-South 
reunification. The plan calls for building an East-West express 
railway linking Seoul and Chongjin via Chongnyang-ri, Chunchon, 
Mt. Sorak, and Mt. Kumgang. The government reported this plan to 
the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] on 19 May. 
  The "three-stage plan on building traffic networks in 
preparations for reunification" the government reported to the 
party that day calls for linking the severed roads and railways 
between Seoul and the DMZ in the first stage; building roads and 
railways in preparation for the North-South exchange of 
materials in the second stage; and building high-speed roads and 
railways after reunification in the third stage. 
  The government and the DLP plan to hold joint meetings soon 
and discuss how to raise funds and other matters for building 
roads and railways linking the North and South. 
  The first stage of this plan calls for renovating the 
National Road No. 1 linking Seoul and Panmunjom via Munsan as a 
preliminary step toward linking Seoul and Pyongyang. It also 
calls for expanding National Road No. 39 linking Seoul and 
Panmunjom via Pyokche, as a detour to Panmunjom. 
  As a preliminary step toward building a Seoul-Wonsan line, 
it 
calls for expanding National Road No. 3 linking Seoul and 
Chorwon via Tongduchon and Yonchon and National Road No. 43 
linking Seoul and Kimhwa via Pochon and Chorwon from two-lane 
roads to four-lane roads. 
  As for the railway system, the plan calls for restoring the 
Munsan-Panmunjom line to link Seoul and Sinuiju. 
  The second stage of the plan on building Seoul-Pyongyang 
links calls for expanding the Seoul-Kaesong road to a six-lane 
expressway and link this road to Seoul's outer beltway. It also 
calls for extending the Freedom Road to link Seoul and Pyongyang 
via Koyang, Munsan, and Kaesong. 
  As for the Seoul-Wonsan road line, the plan calls for 
linking 
Seoul and Wonsan via Tongduchon, Yonchon, Chorwon, and 
Pyonggang. It also calls for extending National Road No. 43 to 
link Seoul and Pyonggang via Pochon, Chorwon, and Kimhwa. 
  As for the railway system for the second stage, the plan 
calls for expanding the Seoul-Sinuiju Line to a double-track 
line or a quadruple-track line. The first two-track line for an 
electric train will link Seoul and Panmunjom via Munsan, and the 
second two-track line for an ordinary train will link Seoul and 
Pyongyang via Munsan, Panmunjom, and Kaesong. 
  The plan also calls for expanding the Seoul-Wonsan railway 
line to a double-track line or a quadruple-track line. The 
first two-track line for an electric train will link Seoul and 
Chorwon via Uijongbu, and the second two-track line for an 
ordinary train will link Seoul and Pyonggang via Uijongbu and 
Panmunjom. 
  The plan also calls for building an East-West electric 
railway line for tourists. This line will link Seoul and Mt. 
Kumgang via Chunchon and Mt. Sorak. 
  The third stage of the plan calls for building a six-lane 
expressway linking Seoul and Nampo via Kimpo, Kanghwa, and 
Haeju. It also calls for expanding the four-lane National Road 
No. 3 to a six-lane expressway to link Seoul and Chongjin via 
Tongduchon, Yonchon, Chorwon, and Wonsan. 
  As for the railway system, the plan calls for renovating the 
Seoul-Sinuiju railway line into a high-speed railway line and 
connect it to the Seoul-Pusan high-speed rail system. Then, 
Pusan and Sinuiju will be linked via Taegu, Taejon, Seoul, 
Pulgwang, Munsan, Kaesong, and Pyongyang. 
  The Seoul-Wonsan railway line will link Seoul and Wonsan via 
Uijongbu, Panmunjom, and Pyonggang. And the East-West 
high-speed railway line will link Seoul and Chongjin via 
Chongnyang-ri, Chunchon, Mt. Sorak, Mt. Paektu, and Wonsan.

<F P=106> [Article by North Korean affairs desk reporter Kim Hyon-ho, </F>
entitled "`You Are Indeed Ignorant'" from the Reporter's 
Memobook] 
  [Text] "You reporters are indeed ignorant." This is a 
rebuke often made by the wife of Mr. Yo Man-chol [former North 
Korean worker who recently defected to the ROK with his family] 
to reporters. We met with Mrs. Yi Ok-kum, Mr. Yo Man-chol's 
wife, for a total of 15 hours over four times in order to cover 
the story about her life in North Korea. Mrs. Yi, who merely 
answered reporters' questions at first, gradually took a more 
positive attitude. This was partly because we became intimate 
with each other as time passed. However, it is more likely that 
she was impatient at reporters "ignorance" on the North Korean 
situation. 
  Her story was that she eked out a living only with boiled 
bean and gruel, and that no other clothes but uniforms were 
supplied to children only once every three years. Moreover, 
they wear the same trousers during summer and winter. They must 
continue wearing socks even after holes are made and by darning 
the holes. She noted that the price of a pair of nylon socks is 
as much as the amount of her husband's monthly salary. Toilets 
even in a large city were made by burying a drum can 
underground, and women dig up night soil from it and carry it to 
farms on a handcart. 
  She made this remarks with a sigh one time and in an angry 
voice the other. Thus, the life of ordinary North Korean people 
is hard to believe for ordinary South Korean people. 
  Not only one or two pieces of "material evidence" proved her 
statement true. This evidence includes her fingernails that are 
growing again after being taken out due to malnutrition; traces 
of pellagra (a disease known to be caused by malnutrition which 
is often seen among the native Mexican people who live on corn) 
that was still left in her arm; and her monologue that the 
mothers of Pok-hwa and Kum-sil, who were her children's 
classmates, showed the same symptoms. 
  What makes it an issue is how the "compatriots" in the South 
accept this enormous "tragic drama" that the North Korean 
residents are suffering. Some people even think that providing 
information on the real miserable situation in North Korea 
itself is an outdated anticommunist education program, or that 
"North Korea is poor. We all know this. How come this is worthy 
of news?" However, in most cases, those who make such remarks 
have less concrete knowledge on the real situation in North 
Korea. Their true intention is indifference. What is even more 
fearful is that some people feel "concealed pleasure" by looking 
at the pains of North Korean residents. In other words, there 
certainly are some people who feel strange pleasure, stating 
that "look at what the communists and Kim Il-song have done! 
This is exactly an outcome of what they did." The extreme 
situation that the North Korean residents are suffering today 
should not be subject to ignorance, indifference, and personal 
pleasure. This problem will come to us as our own problem one 
day, and this cannot be resolved without the will to share their 
pains.

  [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- North Korea seems to have 
stopped sending teams to international athletic events this year 
due to severe food and foreign currency shortages, a government 
official here observed Thursday. 
  The official disclosed that Pyongyang has not taken part in 
any international athletic meetings this year. "Almost 10 
international sports events have been held this year and it 
should have participated in at least seven, but it did not send 
any team," he said. 
  He went on to say that North Korea did not send a team to 
the 
Winter Olympics held last February in Lillehammer, Norway. 
"North Korea applied for entry to the 11th Asia-Pacific Junior 
Ice Hockey Tournament held in Beijing last March, but it gave 
notification that it would not attend at the last minute, he 
said. 
  "The deepening food and foreign currency shortages in North 
Korea are believed to be major reasons not to send its 
representative teams to athletic events overseas," he said. 
  Last year, North Korea dispatched teams to more than 30 
international events including the 16th Winter Universiad held 
in Poland, he added.

    [Editorial Report] ROK vernacular newspapers publish 
editorials and articles on 20 May in reaction to recent reports 
on North Korea's food shortage and economic difficulties. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "North Korea is Hungry." The editorial 
writes North Korea's economic crisis is becoming more apparent 
citing the defection of the Yo Man-chol family and North Korean 
loggers from Russia, Kim Il-song's request to an Indian 
provincial governor for emergency food aid, and the news that 
North Korea is not participating in the Hiroshima Asian Games. 
  The editorial comments that "although South Koreans 
undoubtedly want to help compatriots when they even send aid to 
Somalia, some people are concerned that the aid may only help 
the Kim Il-song regime." Therefore, the editorial asserts that 
"North Korea should convince the South that economic support 
will benefit the people, not the party or the Army, by resolving 
the nuclear issue as soon as possible." 
  Stressing that chaos in North Korea is not desired either by 
the South, the editorial urges the North to withdraw the 
confrontation policy and reconstruct the economy. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,000-word 
article by reporter Yu Sung-u analyzing the background of Kim 
Il-song's request of food aid to India. Recapitulating North 
Korea's decreased crops since the eighties, the article stresses 
that the question is whether North Korea's system can endure the 
food shortage. 
  The article cites an intelligence report stating that "North 
Korea began to release reserve grain" and a contrasting analysis 
that "North Korea is trying to secure enough food to prepare for 
international and UN economic sanctions." The analysis notes 
the fact that North Korea recently purchased low-quality rice 
from Thailand but resold it to European countries and thus, the 
food shortage is not so serious as to bring about a collapse of 
North Korea's establishment. 
  Noting that the critical period will be before the corn 
harvest in July and August this year, the article concludes that 
we still have to wait and see if the slogan "Rice is communism" 
will be paradoxically proven by the collapse of the system due 
to food shortage. 
  HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 3 an 800-word editorial 
entitled "Grievous Situation of North Korea." Listing the 
series of recent incidents proving the economic difficulties, 
the editorial deplores that Kim Il-song and his son are still 
playing the nuclear game. 
  The editorial warns that if the diversion of nuclear 
material 
is proven by the International Atomic Energy Agency's ongoing 
inspection, the UN Security Council will impose economic 
sanctions worsening the situation. The editorial ends by urging 
Kim Il-song to provide nuclear transparency as soon as possible 
to save his establishment as well as his people. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "The North Korean Nuclear Issue and 
its Food Crisis." Referring to North Korea's food shortage as a 
result of North Korea's own style socialists economic system 
and to North Korean defectors' remarks on the food crisis there, 
the editorial says, "North Korean President Kim Il-song's 
request for food aid and medicine from India shows that the 
North Korean food situation has reached a serious point." 
  Referring to North Korea's decreased crops since the 
nineties 
and to South Korea's data on its worse crop production last 
year, the editorial says, "North Korea says its food shortage is 
due to cold weather and harmful insects, but the major factor is 
its collective farming method. It is certain that if North Korea 
continues to maintain the collective system, its agricultural 
production will not be increased any more in the future." 
  Noting the North Korean Government's commitment that it will 
make its people eat rice with meat soup, the editorial says that 
if North Korea really wants to resolve the issue, it must remove 
a wall of closure and join the international community to seek a 
way for coexistence with others. 
  Referring to North Korea's decision not to participate in 
the 
Hiroshima Asian Games, the editorial says that "this clearly 
shows that North Korea faces serious food shortage problems." 
Also, the editorial says, "if North Korea abandons its nuclear 
program and accepts the denuclerization on the Korean peninsula, 
it can receive food and economic aid from South Korea and other 
Western countries. North Korea should no longer adhere to the 
nuclear development program, but return to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. Also it should solve the people's 
clothing, food, and house problems first." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word 
entitled "North Korea's Increasing Food Shortage Problems Show 
an Ominous Sign." Referring to North Korea's serious current 
situation caused by its food shortage and lack of foreign 
currency, the editorial says, "South Korea must be prudent in 
dealing with North Korea's situation, while making efforts to 
resolve the North Korean nuclear issue." 
  Referring to the major background of North Korea's failure 
in 
its agricultural policy and to its lack of foreign currency, the 
editorial says that South Korea can provide grain aid to North 
Korea if the nuclear issue is resolved as was done in 1991. 
Predicting the bleak prospect of North Korea's grain production 
for next year and noting the need for the ROK Government to 
consider providing food aid to North Korea in the future when 
North Korea abandons its nuclear development program, the 
editorial then added, "the food shortage situation is not only 
serious to the North Korean Government, but also to us. It is 
highly possible that whether we want or not, North Korea may 
collapse suddenly. Therefore, we must be thoroughly alert to 
North Korea's possible provocation to plunder rice and oil from 
Seoul.

  [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- Some last-minute wavering 
by Moscow in its decision to send a delegation to the first 
meeting of the South Korea-Russian joint economic committee has 
thrown Seoul officials into utter confusion. The meeting was to 
open in Seoul Friday but less than 24 hours before the delegates 
planned to get started, the Russian Government told Seoul it 
could not send a delegation because of unspecified domestic 
reasons. 
  Moscow then revised its decision and told Seoul it would 
send 
a delegation under a different leader. It changed its mind 
again a short while later, however, saying it wouldn't send a 
delegation after all. 
  Senior Korean Government officials were reportedly stunned 
after receiving the first notice, because the meeting was 
scheduled to be held as they were preparing for President Kim 
Yong-sam's state visit to Russia. The Korean officials heaved a 
collective sigh of relief when they received the second message, 
only to be thrown into confusion again a few hours later. 
  After receiving the first message from Moscow, which said it 
could not send a delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister 
Aleksandr Shokhin, the Foreign Ministry even made an official 
announcement to that effect. But the Russian Embassy in Seoul 
asked the ministry to describe it not as "a cancellation" but as 
"a suspension," saying it would provide further information two 
to three hours later. 
  At 8 P.M. Thursday, the Russian side informed the ministry 
that it would send a delegation led not by Shokhin but by 
another deputy prime minister. Then three hours later at 11 
P.M., the Russian Embassy told the ministry that no delegation 
would be coming to Seoul after all. 
  Shortly afterward, the Russian Government phoned the Korean 
Embassy in Moscow and proposed to hold an unofficial committee 
meeting for two days in the Russian capital from May 30. But the 
Korean side has decided that it would be meaningless to hold 
such a meeting only a day before President Kim is scheduled to 
start his visit to Russia. 
  On Friday, Korean Government officials were unable to find 
out what those "domestic conditions" were. The most plausible 
reason put forward by Korean officials appears to be "the 
political realignment which is taking place in Moscow right 
now," according to sources.

  [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government will propose joint research to industrialize Russia's 
advanced technology in the machinery, materials and aircraft 
fields as well as making better use of scientific brainpower 
over the long term. 
  While demanding overdue payment of 7 million U.S. dollars 
for 
Korean exports, Seoul is considering letting Moscow pay in 
resources to make up for its lack of cash. 
  The government wants to construct an exclusive port for 
Korean vessels in Vostochnyy near Vladivostok and is also 
seeking to use a harbor in the nearby Tuman (Tumen) River. 
  It will present its wish list at the first Korea-Russia 
Economic Cooperation Committee meeting, slated to run two days 
beginning Friday in Seoul. 
  Korea will negotiate to set up a research base in Russia and 
study the former Soviet republic's latest technologies as well 
as pursue joint research. 
  It will mull joining hands with foreign companies to explore 
Russia's vast resources while encouraging local firms to form 
consortiums to take part in resource development. The 
government will offer support by putting up funds. 
  Korea will seek Russia's cooperation on the resumption of 
fishing in the Okhotsk sea with a catch quota of 300,000 tons of 
pollack in the upcoming talks. 
  They will also discuss laying optical submarine cables 
linking Korea, Russia and Japan, and possibly inviting North 
Korea to take part in the project.

  [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- The vice economic planning 
ministers of Korea and China met for a second round Thursday [19 
May] to press for bilateral economic cooperation. 
  In the meeting held at the government building in Kwachon, 
Han Yi-hon and his Chinese counterpart Ye Qing discussed early 
implementation of follow-ups to economic cooperation projects 
agreed on during President Kim Yong-sam's state visit to China 
earlier this year. 
  In addition, they agreed to expand information exchanges on 
pending economic issues and policy management in order to 
improve bilateral economic cooperation in a forward-looking 
manner. They also decided on early implementation of industrial 
cooperation accords in such fields as automobiles, time division 
exchange (TDX) and airplanes. The vice ministers plan to meet 
for a third round in Beijing in the near future. 
  The visiting Chinese official and his party are scheduled to

  [Text] Almost half a million acres of military installation 
protection areas will be decontrolled to the maximum allowable 
extent from next month in a significant move to make way for 
regional development. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae announced in a press 
conference 
yesterday that 433,335 acres (535 million pyong), amounting to 
20 percent of the total privately-owned land in direct use or 
under control of the armed forces, will either be decontrolled 
or deregulated to a large extent. He said the measure, due to 
take effect June 1, is being initiated after a full year of 
consultations with related government agencies and political 
parties. The total area is far in excess of the 283,500 acres 
of protected regions which have been decontrolled since 1973. 
  "The decision to decontrol the protected area is in line 
with 
a directive from President Kim Yong-sam to provide greater 
convenience to residents in affected areas and to contribute to 
national economic development," he said. 
  The areas to be decontrolled are concentrated in the 
northern 
parts of Kyonggi-to and Kangwon-to and include regions located 
close to the metropolitan area and Inchon, the minister 
explained. The affected areas include land in Pochon, Ilsan and 
Koyang, all in Kyonggi-to, and Hwachon, Kangwon-to. 
  In addition, he said, areas near the Civilian Access Control 
Line which have been opened to group tours by civilians and 
recreational activities will be reclassified and downgraded from 
"controlled" to "limited." 
  Minister Yi noted that the measure effectively means that 
regulations pertaining to construction and rehabilitation of 
existing facilities will be eased to open the way for brisk 
development. 
  "Certain military facilities along the coastal areas will 
also be transferred to the Navy, making it simpler for 
construction projects to be approved," he added. 
  Yi went on to say that the draft revision to the Military 
Installation Protection Law has been put on public notice and 
will go into effect June 1. 
  Once the revision is in place, owners, who have for long 
been 
virtually prohibited from exercising their right on their real 
estate holdings, will be able to utilize their land for urban 
development and agricultural activities. However, he said, 
strict measures will also be implemented to ensure that the 
decontrolling of the area will not lend its hand to encouraging 
real estate speculation. 
  "The Construction Ministry is prepared to deliberate 
carefully on each of the applications and only those who are 
judged to be sincerely interested in developing the areas will 
be given approvals," he said. He elaborated that all those 
found to be violating related regulations and filing false 
applications will face criminal charges and be prosecuted to the 
maximum limit. 
  Autonomous groups such as city and provincial 
administrations 
will also establish special task forces to crack down on people 
suspected of engaging in real estate speculation and subject 
them to tax audits, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- Street demonstrations 
during the first four months of this year nearly doubled 
compared with the same period last year due to political issues 
such as the opening of the country's rice market and the 
Sangmudae scandal, according to the prosecution. 
  Reports released by the Prosecutor General's Office Thursday 
said that 2,774 street demonstrations were staged from January 
to April this year compared with 1,578 during the same period 
last year. 
  The number of people taking to the streets in the four-month 
period this year reached 814,900 while 537,100 Koreans 
participated in street demonstrations during the same period 
last year, according to the reports. 
  Student demonstrations topped the list this year with 1,590 
cases involving 432,200 students, followed by 772 protests by 
249,300 people calling for settlement of such grievances as 
establishment of a garbage dump in their region, the reports 
said. 
  More than 130,000 people took part in various peace marches 
on 393 occasions during the first four months of this year while 
labor-management disputes triggered 19 street demonstrations by 
25,000 workers in the same period, according to the reports. 
  The number of violent demonstrations involving wooden sticks 
and steel pipes increased to 41 this year compared with last 
year's eight. The number involving stone-hurling also climbed 
to 39 this year from eight a year ago, the prosecution reports 
said. 
  The only exceptions to the increase in violent 
demonstrations 
were those involving firebombs. Students hurled only 40 
firebombs on three occasions this year, a drastic reduction from 
last year's 900 firebombs thrown during five demonstrations, 
according to the prosecution, which attributed the decrease to 
the public's unfavorable view toward use of firebombs by student 
activists. 
  On 21 occasions this year, demonstrators seized railways and 
roads while 14 demonstrations involved attacks on public 
buildings and facilities. The numbers contrast sharply with 
those of last year, eight and two, respectively, according to 
the prosecution. 
  Political issues including the Uruguay Round trade 
negotiations and the Sangmudae scandal contributed to the sharp 
increase in demonstrations this year compared with last year, 
when people found few political issues to protest amid the Kim 
Yong-sam administration's reform drive involving far-reaching 
probes of wrongdoings and irregularities under past 
administrations, said a prosecution spokesman.

  [Text] Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong said yesterday that 
the government will revise a law governing foreign direct 
investment (FDI) this year to modernize and internationalize 
rules for FDI system. He said the revision of the Foreign 
Capital Inducement Act (FCIA) will be made in this autumn's 
National Assembly session. 
  Through the FCIA revision, the government hopes to eliminate 
or ease rules that hindered the FDI inflow. 
  Many expatriate businessmen have criticized the act for 
being 
too restrictive toward foreign investors. 
  The act, which was passed in 1966, was revised eight times 
in 
the past but has been criticized as being revised piecemeal and 
mostly under foreign pressure. This time, the government seeks 
to rewrite the act "voluntarily" to be more friendly to foreign 
businessmen, a Ministry of Finance official said. 
  The minister acknowledged that despite efforts, Korea could 
not make drastic improvements for foreign businessmen due to 
"domestic- oriented factors." But Korea can no longer delay its 
plan to improve the FDI climate. 
  Minister Hong said Korea should improve its foreign direct 
investment system to levels prevailing in Western OECD 
(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) 
countries.

  [Text] Seoul, May 20 (YONHAP) -- A South Korean university 
science team has developed the country's first satellite 
transponder and the world's seventh after such nations as the 
United States, Japan and France. 
  After nearly four years of research and financial aid of 500 
million won from the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry, an 
electronic engineering department team at Kwangun University led 
by Prof. Na Kuk-hwan said Friday it has developed a satellite 
transponder for broadcasting on the tricky Ku frequency band. 
  Industry sources say a Ku-band transponder is designed to 
operate in space for more than 10 years and can be installed in 
a satellite anytime for satellite broadcasting as well as 
communications. 
  "We will be able to install Korean-made transponders in 
satellites and save some 800 million won for every unit in doing 
so," Na said. He said the transponder can be widely applied in 
satellite receivers, ground stations and cellular facilities for 
satellite broadcasting. Na's development will be awarded the top 
prize in the government-sponsored industry-academy-research 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [First installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F>
appearing in the 5 March issue on page 3: By reporter Kim 
Tong-chol] 
  [Text] With the completion of political-reform 
legislation, Korean politics have reached a great turning point. 
In this article, we examine the question of whether the 
integrated election law, the Local Autonomy Law, and the 
Political Funding Law, created aiming for a new political 
climate of "clean politics" and "elections that do not take 
money," can actually recreate Korean political culture, the 
blueprint presented by political-reform legislation, and 
concrete problems associated with putting the legislation into 
action. 
  Will "elections that do not take money" and "clean politics" 
actually be realized? 
  The three pieces of legislation (Public Election and 
Election-Irregularities Prevention Law, Political Funding Law, 
and Local Autonomy Law) passed in the Assembly plenary session 
have various institutional mechanisms for the realization of 
clean politics. 
  An integrated election law, the Public Election and 
Election-Irregularities Prevention Law, in particular has many 
more new provisions regulating money-corrupted elections than 
any of the succession of election laws before it. When viewed 
only as a legal statute, it provides for the realization of 
elections that do not take money, the foundation of clean 
politics. 
  First of all, it limits to a great extent various kinds of 
election expenses. In the case of a National Assembly election, 
it set a limit of an average of 65 million won [W]. It in fact 
abolished the salaried-election-campaign-worker system, pointed 
out as the main culprit behind overheated, corrupt elections, 
and changed election campaigns to make them volunteer-service 
oriented. 
  Also, it prohibited party-unity rallies and the street 
distribution of small-sized, leaflet-type printed material 
during the campaign period, both of which have caused trouble 
every election. Instead, the Central Election Management 
Committee [CEMC] reduced the burden of personnel expenses 
resulting from distribution by forwarding to each household the 
small-sized printed material of each candidate. 
  To this was added the strengthening of institutional 
regulation so that such mechanisms for the minimization of 
election expenses could be effective. 
  In the past, each candidate reported election expenses to 
the 
CEMC as a total amount after an election. In the future, 
however, receipt and payment of money must be done only through 
a deposit account and expenses must be recorded in detail as 
follows and presented to the CEMC: 
  --date and time, 
  --location, 
  --person receiving money, 
  --address, and 
  --resident registration number. 
  It also authorized the publication of election-expense 
details and the viewing of these by opposing candidates and 
voters. It made it possible for the CEMC, when there are 
suspicions of misconduct, to request materials from the 
appropriate financial institution, despite the financial 
real-name system emergency order. 
  Additionally, it strengthened penal regulations. For cases 
in 
which a fine of W1 million and above or a suspended prison 
sentence and five years and above is given for election-law 
violations, a ten-year restriction is placed on the violator's 
right to hold a public-service leadership position. Also, the 
range of joint responsibility resulting in election annulment 
was expanded to include election officials, persons in charge of 
accounts, spouses, and even direct descendants. Therefore, if 
exposed in connection with illegal, corrupt election 
campaigning, not only will a person be driven from public 
office, but it is as plain as day that he or she will end up 
ruining his or her self and family. 
  "It is a law strong enough to have the effect of a 
guillotine 
on candidates," explains one person associated with the Special 
Political Committee. 
  The problem, however, is dependent on how reality supports 
the ideals of this law. The fact is, few people believe past 
election practices, described as unjust, corrupt, and excessive, 
will disappear with just a revision of the law. As always, 
illicit exchanges of gifts and money will not disappear from the 
election process. Some even foresee that the tricks used will 
become more sophisticated. 
  Even the lawmakers who passed the politics-related laws 
confess that it leans too much toward the "idealistic," hinting 
at the difficulties which lie ahead until the purpose of the 
legislation is actually fulfilled. There are actually many 
among lawmakers of the opinion that "It is a fantasy law, made 
by those bewitched by ideals." 
  That is, it is pointed out, as voter awareness and the mood 
of society are not changing, it is excessively ambitious to try 
to realize clean politics by creating laws based on the election 
laws of the United Kingdom, a politically advanced country. 
  On the premise, "The three main elements of an election are 
organization, funding, and personality," one ruling-party 
lawmaker asserted, "It is too much to expect us to carry out an 
election with organization and funding cut off." 
  In short, for the forces with vested interests, the disposal 
of this politics-related legislation was definitely unwelcome. 
However, despite the negative perspective of some, there are 
many more of the opinion that the "will for clean politics" 
contained in these election laws should be rated highly and 
definitely must be realized. It is as plain as day that, if for 
nothing else than to clear up the public's deep distrust and 
cynicism toward the political world, politics must be cleaned up 
and that the first step must be election reform. 
  In this sense, assessing this disposal of politics-related 
legislation as "the greatest result of the civilian government's 
reform, a new milestone for the advancement of politics," the 
ruling party core is praising the integrated election law in the 
extreme, even using the term "revolution." That is, in spite of 
the fact that there were also mechanisms for clean elections in 
the previous succession of election laws, these were not 
supported by the will of the ruler to put them into action; thus 
they became dead letters. In consideration for this fact, the 
election laws passed this time were meant to suggest that the 
ruler's will and a strong enforcement of the laws will follow. 
  Together with the passage of the election laws, the fact 
that 
the local-autonomy elections to take place in the spring of next 
year are forecast by those in the periphery of politics to be 
the "slaughterhouse of violators" can be understood as a reading 
of the inner thoughts of the ruling-party leadership. 
<H5>  * Effects of Political Reform Law </H5>
<F P=106> [Second installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F>
appearing in the 6 March issue on page 3: By reporter Yi Chae-ho] 
  [Text] In response to a question on 5 March asking about 
the future influence of the new politics-related legislation on 
the political domain, Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] Secretary 
General Mun Chong-su said this instead of answering. 
  "Now we have no choice but to run with our feet. There's 
nothing else we can do. Even so, at least we are a little better 
off..." 
  His words, "We are a little better off," seemed to be 
permeated with the confidence of the old Democratic Party [DP] 
faction within the ruling party of having long carried out 
elections from a position of financial and organizational 
inferiority. Does this then mean that the Democratic Justice 
Party [DJP] faction has been put at a relative disadvantage? 
  The new politics-related laws have content which will bring 
change to politics worthy to be called a revolution. They 
severely restrict money and organizations, and free up speech. 
With money and organizations restricted, the form of elections 
cannot help but change. As a result, this can lead to a change 
of the political class and structure. 
  With the establishment of the new election laws, Mr. Y (41), 
who has been an aid to members of the National Assembly for over 
ten years, made up his mind to run for office in the 15th 
General Election. His constituency is K-ku [as published], with 
a population of over 80,000. According to the new laws, he must 
prepare about W600,000 in campaign funds. Money having been his 
greatest worry, there is now no longer a reason for him to 
hesitate. An "election that does not take money" offers him an 
unparalleled opportunity. This is because, first of all, the 
entrance fee into the political arena for newcomers has dropped. 
  "It is a fact that political newcomers are now in a 
favorable 
position for challenging the establishment," said DLP lawmaker 
Choe Pyong-ryol. Will not the young, conscientious people of 
local society, who had avoided running because of fear of money 
and the established organization of the ruling party, think of 
trying at least once, he asks. If only the laws are enforced, 
the merit of money and financial power will disappear, he said. 
  DP lawmaker Yi Chol made a similar prediction. "Although, 
due 
to the continued existence of government organizations, it 
cannot be said that the organizational advantages which the 
ruling party has enjoyed in successive elections have completely 
disappeared, there will at least be a change in the aspects of 
elections which had been decided by money," he said. 
  If opportunities are broadened for political newcomers, it 
could become that much more difficult for those with vested 
political power to defend their positions. If the utility of 
money and organization disappears, character, achievements, name 
recognition, novelty, and morality will become more important 
variables. The prediction that a change of personnel will be 
brought about in the political arena due to the new laws is 
based on this. 
  In its recent selection of chief organizers for 14 problem 
local party chapters, the DLP excluded "financial power" from 
its list of qualifications examined for each candidate. Thus, an 
item has been dropped which until now has been considered 
important, in examinations for party nomination of parliamentary 
candidates, by Korea's conservative political parties, 
regardless of whether they were ruling or opposition parties. 
Secretary General Mun said, "In the future, there will have to 
be a revolutionary change in the selection standards of 
candidates for public office." 
  The DLP plans to first begin putting things in order with 30 
weak local chapters and increase this as the election draws near. 
  Since the time they came out last year, some lawmakers 
within 
the DLP have taken the new election laws as a sign that 
personnel changes were going to take place. 
  Change is unavoidable in the opposition parties as well. It 
is still difficult to determine what changes will come to 
districts with deep-rooted, "incumbants-first" traditions. 
However, if "elections that do not take money" are brought about 
properly, at least the opposition parties will have no 
justification for selling nominations for candidacy to run for 
the nationwide constituencies in order to provide for campaign 
funds. Until now, one of the most important justifications 
opposition parties have had for selling ahead of time 
national-constituency seats has been "for the party to provide 
campaign funds for candidates with no money." 
  "Elections that do not take money" may also bring change to 
the traditional, factional politics of opposition parties. This 
is because if a candidate does not receive funding support from 
a faction boss, the need to form and maintain a servile 
relationship with the boss will become that much diminished. 
  The probability of a change of personnel through party 
nominations is predicted to be relatively lower for the 
opposition parties. "Despite the new laws, a hacking-style 
change of personnel is unlikely for our party due to involved 
human relationships unique to an opposition party," said a DP 
official. However, there are no opposition figures confident the 
opposition parties can continue to survive merely by maintaining 
these traditions. 
  Changing people through party nominations is a "top-down 
change of personnel." Traditionally, the range of these 
personnel changes has been broad for the ruling party and narrow 
for the opposition parties. Apparently, the political-reform 
legislation will be somewhat of a shock to this tradition. 
However, what is drawing more attention is the "bottom-up 
change of personnel." If the political-reform legislation brings 
change even to the political awareness of voters, the "bottom-up 
change of personnel" will be even more conspicuous. 
  If a political culture is established in which policy and 
vision have power instead of money and agitation, and voters 
respond to this or instigate it, as is the aim of the 
political-reform legislation, then personnel changes in the 
political arena will come about more rapidly and broadly than is 
generally anticipated. 
  In an interview with a reporter asking for one thing most 
needed for political reform, a high-level figure of the ruling 
party said bluntly, "changing people." It was a pointed 
reference to the urgent need for a change of personnel. This 
time, this will of the political world even got the support of 
institutional reform. The results cannot help but be closely 
watched. 
<H5>  * Parties Face Major Changes </H5>
<F P=106> [Third installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F>
appearing in the 8 March issue on page 2: By reporter Chang 
Pyong-su] 
  [Text] The organization and structure of our country's 
political parties are huge compared to their normal operations. 
They have long suffered "chronic obesity." 
  In United States and other politically advanced nations, 
there are many cases in which local-party-chapter organization 
is practically non-existent. The few full-time workers of even 
party headquarters cannot be compared with those in Korea. 
  Why does this strange phenomenon continue to exist in years 
without elections, with its hundreds of paid party members 
watching the enormous central party building, even though they 
have little to do? 
  The Korean thinking that "a political party must have party 
influence, and for party influence it must have a very strong 
organization and a large number of personnel," has been pointed 
out as the main reason for this. Also, because of the climate in 
which one has to make one's face known around the party to have 
an advantage in party nominations, political hopefuls have 
crowded into the periphery of the party. Some even understand 
the inclusion of these people, not based on any general 
principle, to have resulted only in the growth of the 
organization. 
  It is inevitable that the political-reform legislation 
passed 
this time operate on this serious illness of our political arena. 
  First of all, in the case of the ruling party, with 
political 
funding having been greatly reduced, it has no choice but to 
greatly cut back personnel costs. With the creation of political 
funds more difficult due to the implementation of the financial 
real-name system, apart from organizational downsizing there is 
no other method available for doing this, it is explained. 
  Last year, the DLP brought in about W36.7 billion: a 
government subsidy of W8.48 billion, a designated trust fund of 
W19.9 billion, and party fees and support funding from the Party 
Supporters Association of W8.2 billion. However, party finances 
are left in the red when total expenditures are at W40.4 
billion: 

  -  operational expenses, including personnel 
expenses, W23.5 billion; 
  -  organizational-activity expenses, W8.6 
billion; 
  -  policy expenses, W7.5 billion; and 
  -  publicity 
expenses, W700 million. 

  Fortunately, the DLP last year sold the plot of its 
Karak-tong training institute, bringing in over W70 billion. 
With the interest it was able to make up its deficit. The DLP 
has about 780 salaried officials: over 300 clerical personnel at 
the central party headquarters and municipal and provincial 
branch offices; and 474 secretariat directors and organizational 
department directors at 237 local party chapters. A 
characteristic of the party is that, due to the aftereffects of 
the three-party merger, people from the three factions are 
"evenly" dispatched to be full-time personnel; hiring is not 
centered on ability or work. 
  Even apart from causes such as financial pressures, public 
opinion is growing for the entire political culture to be 
reformed. The DLP is considering "getting rid of the flab" in 
party operations from various angles. 
  In the central party, a proposal is being actively 
considered 
to leave a few committees, such as organization, policy, and 
public relations, but reduce the number full-time personnel as 
much as possible. There are also some who observe that local 
party chapters will move centered around an operations 
committee, with one full-time employee, and that the number 
chief organizers at the tong, t'ong, and pan [t'ong and pan are 
administrative subdivisions of a tong] level will be cut back on 
a large scale. 
  In the DP, persons are working who have long stood in the 
front lines of the struggle against dictatorship, in the 
"democracy-versus-anti-democracy" political framework of the 
past, making artificial reduction of the organization unlikely. 
Because of this, in the Supreme Representatives Council held on 
7 March, all that was decided upon was the principle that in the 
next meeting of the Executive Committee the issue of forming a 
special committee for organizational strengthening would be 
discussed and party-organizational-reform proposals would be 
reviewed. 
  However, a large-scale reorganization of the system is 
unavoidable in order to cope with the new political environment, 
according to the analysis of the Party Policy Committee given 
through this day's policy report. "An improvement of the 
presently lax party operational structure and a reordering of 
the central party and local party chapters in keeping with the 
new law is urgently needed," the Policy Committee pointed out. 
  With 191 full-time personnel at its central-party office, 
the 
DP's expenditures totaled over W7.68 billion last year. It 
brought in a total of over W8.72 billion: a government subsidy 
of W6.72 billion and party fees of W1.63 billion [as published]. 
Its settlement of accounts ended in the black purely because of 
"stingy management," it insists. 
  The DP's policy-promotion expenses for last year were W83.2 
million, less than 1 percent of its total expenses. In keeping 
with the mood that now opposition parties too must seriously 
pursue policy development, policy-related expenses this year are 
predicted to increase tremendously so finance management will be 
as tight as always, says a party source. 
  Saying he thinks policy development to be the only way for 
the opposition party to survive in keeping with an era demanding 
new politics, DP Secretary General Kim Tok-kyu stressed that now 
the opposition party too would make considerable investment in 
the policy field. 
  There are many voices stating that a new party management is 
unavoidable for both ruling and opposition parties, and there 
many of the opinion that ultimately a climate will have to be 
created in which at election time party representatives directly 
select candidates for public office, as is the example of 
advanced countries. It is clear that only this bottom-up 
political reform is capable of uprooting the wrong practices of 
central politics. 
  Together with political-reform legislation, ruling and 
opposition parties are preparing for various future elections 
and promising to put things in order internally. This beginning 
will become a yardstick for measuring ahead of time "clean 
politics" in the 1995 local-government elections and in the 1996 
general election. 
<H5>  * Reform Law's Flaws Outlined </H5>
<F P=106> [Fourth installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F>
appearing in the 9 March issue on page 2: By reporter Hong 
Un-taek] 
  [Text] Passed unanimously in the National Assembly on 4 
March by both ruling- and opposition-party lawmakers, the three 
politics-related laws are in the spotlight for having prepared a 
framework for political reform. However, there are also shadows 
concealed by that light. 
  These shadows are cast by the inability of each of the 
negotiating parties, the ruling party, the opposition, and the 
Ministry of Home Affairs, to shake off their own interests. This 
is also something to watch carefully in the succeeding process 
of revision by the president, National Assembly regulations, and 
regional ordinances. In this integrated election law, the ruling 
and opposition parties charged the Electoral District 
Demarcation Committee [EDDC] with debating the issue of 
adjusting electoral districts, which had long been done 
arbitrarily. This is a step forward. 
  As a result of this, however, the right to adjust the 
electoral districts of local assemblymen is exercised as always 
by the National Assembly. This is self-contradictory. This makes 
possible the observation that, even while it is being claimed 
that local autonomy is being greatly expanded, the conception 
remains that local assemblies are agencies subordinate to the 
National Assembly. 
  The question of how to compose the National Assembly EDDC is 
not simple either. There is a great probability of conflict 
arising between the ruling and opposition parties. This is 
because the local-district-adjustment issue is directly related 
to the political survival of individual lawmakers. Therefore, 
both ruling- and opposition-party lawmakers hope the EDDC will 
be composed in a way maximally beneficial to them. There is 
plenty of room for conflicting interests. 
  The EDDC may present a proposal to reduce local-district 
representatives to within the quota of 299 members for the 
National Assembly and increase the ratio of 
national-constituency representatives. That is how great its 
power will be. 
  The political trust-fund system continues to exist in the 
Revised Political Funding Law. This is a product of compromise. 
Even so, it was decided that the revised law would not make 
public the list of designated depositors, as is the case with 
the present law. 
  Although limited to less than W500 million, a designated 
trust fund is still a large amount of money. Not making the 
depositors public is inconsistent with the revision's purpose of 
raising the transparency of political funds. 
  In the Revised Local Autonomy Law, it was decided to give 
local assemblymen a monthly parliamentary-activities fee. Even 
so, it did not reduce the number of local assemblymen, which had 
been greatly increased on the assumption that they would be 
unpaid, honorary positions. This will put a great burden on 
local finances. 
  Local assemblymen number some 5,170 persons: wide-area, 866; 
basic, 4,304. As for monthly pay, in the future its upper limit 
will be fixed by presidential decree and concrete amounts will 
be fixed by local councils in ordinances. There will be cases in 
which assemblymen from local councils with insufficient finances 
will stubbornly demand salaries as large as those of assemblymen 
belonging to "rich" local councils. 
  In several places in the political-reform-related 
legislation 
is included the proviso, "limited to the first election after 
this law is put into effect." 
  First is the Public Election Law. If members of the National 
Assembly or of local assemblies would run for local council 
chief, they must resign from their present position 90 days 
before the election. However, there is a proviso that, limited 
to next year's 27 June election, all they have to do is resign 
from their present position before the candidate-registration 
application day. 
  This is the result of pressure by lawmakers desiring to 
become the local council chiefs, insisting that they must start 
their campaigns retaining their identities as lawmakers. 
Therefore, the time of resignation was put off "to give them 
sufficient time to carefully consider whether they will run for 
office." 
  Also, the Revised Local Autonomy Law set the status of 
deputy 
mayors, county deputy chiefs, and district office deputy 
directors as local government officials. Even so, it 
characterizes them as national government officials, but this is 
limited to the term of the mayors and county chiefs selected 
next year. This difference in status brings a difference in the 
one with the power to appoint them. If the deputy chief of a 
local council is a local government official, then the chief of 
the local council is the one with the power to appoint him. If 
he is a national government official, then he is appointed by 
the central government. 
  Limited to those selected next year, the central government 
is supposed to appoint deputy mayors, etc. There is a reason for 
this. It was done out of consideration for Home Affairs 
bureaucrats who will loose their positions with city-county 
unification. 
  The local council deputy chief was characterized as a local 
government official in both the pre-revision law and in the 
revised law. It was the Ministry of Home Affairs which 
stubbornly insisted that, limited solely to persons selected 
next year, this should be made a national government position. 
Given this attitude of the Ministry of Home Affairs, there is 
even the possibility the class of the position of local council 
deputy chief will be adjusted upward to become a 
national-government position in the future. The classification 
of national-government positions is supposed to be set by 
presidential decree. Upward adjustment does not require the 
deliberation of the National Assembly. 
  That the law allows for there to be two local council deputy 
chiefs in 15 cities and provinces has potential to be a problem. 
Which cities and provinces can have two local council deputy 
chiefs is supposed to be set by presidential decree. The problem 
is the criterion. 
  For example, if having a population of 2 million is made the 
standard, will Taejon, Kwangju, and Cheju Province, which are 
excluded from this, do nothing? Does this then mean it would be 
okay to have two local council deputy chiefs in each city and 
province? 
<H5>  * Reform Said To Benefit Opposition </H5>
<F P=106> [Fifth installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F>
appearing in the 10 March issue on page 2: By reporter Kim 
Chang-hyok] 
  [Text] On 4 March, the day the "Public Election and 
Election-Irregularities Prevention Bill" passed the National 
Assembly, ruling-party lawmakers complained about articles 60, 
62, and 141 of the bill, which was distributed to their seats, 
"Now we're completely naked." 
  --Article 60 (Persons Who May Participate in Election 
Campaigns). As public-campaign organizations established by 
special laws, full-time workers, temporary workers, and the 
central chairmen of organizations receiving contributions or aid 
from the national government or local councils (Living Right 
Campaign Council, Sae Maul Campaign Council, Korea Freedom 
Alliance [Hanguk Chayu Chongyonmaeng]) may not participate in 
election campaigns. 
  --Article 62 (Assignment of Election-Campaign Office 
Personnel). The number of campaign office workers who may 
receive compensation and allowances, for the election of members 
of the National Assembly with local constituencies and for the 
election of municipal and provincial local council chiefs, is 
limited to within 1.5 times the number of up, myon, and tong in 
the counties or municipalities of districts with a campaign 
office or campaign liaison office. 
  --Article 141 (Limits on Party-Unity Rallies). 
Beginning 30 days before the day of the commencement of the 
election-campaign period through election day, political parties 
may not hold party-unity rallies or party-member workshops in 
electoral districts in which an election is scheduled or in 
progress aimed at party members who are district residents, 
regardless of whether for party-member training, unity, or other 
purpose. Lawmakers complained because these articles choke the 
life out of organization and funding, which in the past have 
been called the "premium" of the ruling party. 
  From the exact opposite standpoint, opposition-party 
lawmakers shouted with delight. In an informal gathering of DP 
lawmakers quickly convened on the night of the 4th when the 
election bill was passed, floor leader Kim Tae-sik declared, 
"The ruling party, which has depended on funding and 
organization, in now a Ben Johnson out of drugs." As though many 
were reminded of the scene of Carl Lewis running past Ben 
Johnson, all the lawmakers applauded. Bringing up the bill's 
Article 79, which allows the use of vehicles and loudspeakers, 
campaigning on roadsides, vacant lots, markets, etc., DP 
lawmakers exchanged "serious talk in jest," saying that it was 
now the "Era of the Opposition-Party Premium." 
  Has the ruling-party premium, the hotbed of past illegal and 
law-evasive elections, actually disappeared to the extent that 
people would be using the words "opposition-party premium"? Has, 
therefore, truly equitable competition between ruling and 
opposition parties been achieved, so that the will of the people 
is reflected in elections without distortion? The majority of 
both ruling and opposition parties answer, "Yes, for now." 
Actually, during the early and middle portions of past 
election-campaign periods, and at the very last, with on two or 
three days left before election day, ruling-party lawmakers gave 
funds to even pan [a subdistrict of a tong] organizers. The pan 
organizers would then hold guest symposiums, actually 
party-unity rallies, passing out money to voters. Thus, this was 
only regulated in a superficial way. The new election laws, 
however, stop this in a fundamental way. The covert support of 
government-sponsored organizations can no longer be hoped for 
either. 
  In the past, even though illegal campaign activities or 
those 
evasive of the law were exposed, a candidate could be "safe" by 
avoiding directly "having blood on his hands." Now, however, 
with a guilt-by-association system, election-law violations by 
head election officials, spouses, direct descendants, or persons 
responsible for campaign-office accounts result in the annulment 
of a candidate's election. Not only this, but candidates can now 
object to a prosecutor's wrongful disposal of an action as an 
election offense and even apply for adjudication. Thus, it is 
the DP's analysis of the election laws that it is now possible 
to exclude the arbitrary application of prosecution authority 
and hold fair elections. 
  The attitudes of ruling-party lawmakers are also changing 
naturally. "I don't know about other people, but in the 14th 
General Election, I myself tried very hard to keep the law," 
said DLP lawmaker Rep. K, confessing, "But at least in political 
funding, you can't keep the law. I finally ended up using 
several billion won." Rep. (DLP) Hwang Yun-ki too, who had been 
a politics-related legislation negotiator, said, "Without the 
understanding that the party in power, depending on the 
situation, may become the opposition party, we can now no longer 
carry out an election." In some corners of the ruling party 
there is tension, and it is even said, "The real reason 
President Kim Yong-sam mentions English-style clean elections at 
every opportunity is to signify that he will arrest and 
invalidate the election of election-law violators, even if they 
belong to the ruling party and regardless of their number, as 
the United Kingdom did during the early period of its election 
reform." According to the evaluation (Situation Report) of the 
DP, "The unfair election practices of the past, which saw the 
ruling party's organization and funding square off against the 
opposition's wind operations [as published], have for now been 
changed into a climate in which it is possible for the ruling 
party and opposition to carry out elections from positions of 
equality." 
  However, as far as election campaigning goes, it is still 
too 
early to state that the ruling party and opposition have 
achieved a "relationship of complete balance" with the new 
election laws. For now, it is predicted that we will see 
pre-election activities by private organizations, such as family 
associations, hometown-friendship associations, and factional 
gatherings. If private organizations end up having a decisive 
influence on elections, it will no doubt be due to the 
advantageous position of ruling-party candidates, who have 
strong funding-raising capabilities. "The moment I looked at the 
election laws, the first thought that came to my mind was that 
I'm going to have to pay a little more attention to factional 
gatherings composed of market merchants and to family 
associations, which have only had a few personnel changes for 
appearance sake," responded ruling-party lawmaker Han Chae-son. 
  Despite the concerns of some, it is the general consensus 
that a large framework for equal competition between the ruling 
and opposition parties was created with the new election laws. 
Now all that remains is to create a strong will to enforce the 
law at the government level as well as an intention to keep it 
in the candidate, and to change the public's perspective so that 
it views as a "natural spectacle" the "unfamiliar environment" 
in which a ruling-party candidate does not use money. 
<H5>  * Fair Election Culture To Develop </H5>
<F P=106> [Sixth installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F>
appearing in the 11 March issue on page 2: By reporter Hong 
Un-taek] 
  [Text] With the integrated election laws enacted recently, 
the tradition of drawing lots to select the order in which 
speeches are to be given at joint election-speech rallies has 
become more important. 
  At joint election-speech rallies, the person speaking first 
is generally at a disadvantage. This is because afterward, one 
does not have a chance to defend oneself against an attacking 
opponent. One of the reasons unknown candidate Choe Uk-chol (DP) 
was able to upset national political giant candidate Kim 
Myong-yun (DLP) was Choe's luck in drawing lots. 
  Being a compound electoral district, in every one of the 
four 
rounds of joint election-speech rallies he got a good draw. 
Taking the stage after Kim, he monopolized opportunities to 
criticized Kim's parachute nominations of parliamentary 
candidates and to refute in detail Kim's campaign promises. 
  Compared to present law, the recently passed Public Election 
Law reduced the number of joint campaign-speech rallies, in the 
case of candidates for the National Assembly, from three to two. 
The hands of candidates drawing lots have come to tremble even 
more. 
  Over 80 percent of the audiences going to the joint 
campaign-speech grounds have been people mobilized by candidates 
to show off their power. These were loudly-cheering units of 
applauders. They would continuously called out their candidate's 
name while another candidate was giving a speech and then 
applauded when their candidate spoke regardless of what was said. 
  However, it is only naturally that these scenes will 
disappear beginning in the next election because candidates 
cannot use money, the most effective means for mobilizing people. 
  Now they will have to go around to places where people 
gather, not gather people together. The new election laws 
authorized the street campaign speeches of individual candidates 
without a limit on the number given. Concerned candidate's 
throats may get sore, the laws put a loudspeaker in their hands. 
  Accordingly, this means that whether or not one is elected 
may be decided by how one makes use of a loudspeaker. 
  Basic loudspeaker-usage rules (based on a general election) 
are as follows. First, only one authorized loudspeaker with a 
CEMC seal of approval may be used. Second, one loudspeaker may 
be used taking turns with one's spouse. One can now gain an 
advantage because of one's husband or wife. Third, one may not 
turn on a loudspeaker while moving in a vehicle. A loudspeaker 
may only be used in a fixed state. Lastly, there are also 
usage-time limitations: usage is authorized until 2300. 
  Apart from these usage rules, accountability follows the 
words going out through the loudspeaker. In a position of 
attack, the opposition-party candidate is wrong if he thinks he 
has obtained a weapon by which he can attack the ruling party to 
his heart's content. Laws against libeling a candidate have 
been strengthened. If a person uselessly brings up a fact, 
slandering a candidate or his or her spouse, direct descendants, 
brothers or sisters, that person is subject to up to three years 
imprisonment or up to a W5 million fine. 
  Even apart from these matters demanding special attention, 
thought must be given for cases in which street 
campaign-speeches degenerate into noise pollution. Even if 
saying what is right, if everyone chatters away with a 
loudspeaker, this of itself can stir up antipathy. 
  Although authorized until 2300, care must be taken not to 
cause "sleep disturbance" in the vicinity of residential areas 
late at night. Finding people to work for free is one of the 
keys to the next election. This is because the new election laws 
reduced the number of salaried election-campaign workers, 
calling instead for the use of volunteers. Because of this, 
people who in the past worked in social movements are even 
predicted to have somewhat of an advantage. 
  This is also the cause of the recent increase in trips by 
members of the National Assembly to their districts. 
  It is also the answer at which they finally arrived after 
anguishing over how to gain the hearts of voters, if not with 
money, organization, or wind tactics. 
  This is because, although it is commonly said that, in the 
future, victories will have to be had with fresh policies, they 
think that there is nothing like making one's face known in 
one's district and scratching where voters itch to gain points. 
  One representative who participated in political-reform 
negotiations confessed that even while carrying on daily, 
night-long negotiations, the thought kept occurring to him, "I 
shouldn't be here doing this." Rather than rewards and 
recognition for his efforts concerning his participation in an 
historical work, he is more concerned about reactions that 
question why he is staying in Seoul and not coming down to his 
district. 
  There is even concern over adverse effects of the 
recently-passed Public Election Law: difficulty distinguishing 
between who is a local assemblyman and who is a member of the 
National Assembly. 
<H5>  * Changes Seen for Voters </H5>
<F P=106> [Seventh and last installment of the "Winds of Political </F>
Reform" appearing in the 13 March issue on page 2: By reporter 
Han Ki-hung] 
  [Text] "Seoul may be a little better. But the narrowly 
confined country is different. Most voters are closely connected 
by school, blood, all kinds of personal ties. When meeting them 
after a long time, it is not easy to then just go our separate 
ways. There are many times when they come out expecting food and 
alcohol. Even if it costs a lot, you have to greet them without 
disappointing them. If you just leave without doing anything 
special for them, they'll say you are a rotten person. Apart 
from the question of success or failure in an election, what 
politician wants to be called that?" 
  Mr. K is a DP lawmaker originally from a rural area who has 
been elected three times. Whether at election time or during 
ordinary times, money is always a concern, but an "election that 
does not take money" will not be so easy either, he says. So, as 
he looked at the integrated election law passed in the National 
Assembly on 4 March, he was actually worried more than anything 
else, he admitted. 
  With their words, voters condemn corrupt elections. They 
change, however, when they are the ones concerned. If someone 
else takes something, it is "corruption"; if I take something, 
it is "gratitude." They seem to have a duplicitous way of 
thinking. 
  "Could it be that they're accustomed to the long years of 
illegal elections? Voters feel no sense of guilt when they are 
treated to dinners or are even given money envelopes by 
candidates." 
  Voters' sense of guilt is dull or atrophying, according to 
the diagnosis of Kap Nak-kyun, president of the Alliance of 
Korean Women Voters [Hanguk Yosong Yugwonja Yonmaeng]. Thus, to 
make "elections that do not take money" successful, the work of 
restoring this atrophied awareness is needed, Kap points out. 
  What do voters have to say? The results of a poll of voters' 
opinions by the CEMC show a significant trend. 
  An opinion poll was taken immediately after the March 1992 
14th General Election. It asked voters who said they had taken 
money, gifts, or been entertained their reasons for doing so. 36 
percent responded that they accepted it, "Because I could not 
refuse." However, 27.5 percent answered, "Because it is a common 
occurrence during elections"; 15.2 percent, "I don't really 
know"; and 9.6 percent, "Because I directly or indirectly 
demanded it." 
  There are not many instances of voters themselves demanding 
and receiving money or gifts. However, one thing was clear from 
this survey: many voters think nothing of accepting money, 
gifts, or entertainment. 
  A voter-opinion poll was taken in several districts before 
the April 1993 National Assembly Special Election. The greatest 
number, 37.8 percent, responded that for clean elections, voters 
should not vote for candidates committing unlawful acts. 
However, 87.1 percent of voters said they did not know which 
candidate better obeyed the election laws. The thought that one 
should not vote for a candidate who breaks the law easily 
becomes hollow. Furthermore, 88.9 percent responded that they do 
not report it even though they witness the illegal election acts 
of a candidate. 
  The election laws contain statutes punishing voters 
accepting 
money and gifts as well as the candidate giving them. However, 
the CEMC and public prosecutors have concentrated on monitoring 
the law violations and evasions of political parties and 
candidates. They were lenient toward voters. 
  Now, however, people are beginning to point out that voters 
too must work jointly for clean elections, prepared to submit to 
punishment if they commit illegal acts. The mood of society is 
gradually increasing that, casting off the passive attitude of 
merely not accepting money, gifts, or entertainment, voters must 
display an active, citizen's spirit, monitoring and reporting 
violations committed by candidates and voters. 
  CEMC Public Relations Management Officer Chong Il-hwan said, 
"Although reporting by voters is increasing, it needs to become 
more active." Son Pong-suk, director of the Korean Women's 
Political Research Center, pledged that citizens organizations, 
including the Women's Political Research Center, will lead the 
way in monitoring to ensure the success of "elections that do 
not take money," the aim of the newly created integrated 
election law. 
  That voters must demonstrate a spirit of citizenship is not 
merely for clean elections alone. It is also for putting 
politics in its rightful place. Members of the National Assembly 
and local assemblymen must be liberated from having to 
participate in events for congratulations and condolences -- 
generally, weddings and funerals -- and local functions in order 
to be faithful to their work in the legislature. The resolution 
by the DP's Political Reform Group [Chongchi Kaehyok Moim] 
(chief executive Im Chae-chong) not to send out money envelopes 
or floral wreaths is one attempt to move in this direction. This 
kind of movement must also arise among voters, or at least this 
kind of determination.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] made 
an urgent proposal to North Korea today that it will immediately 
send its negotiators [hyopsangtim] to Pyongyang to discuss 
necessary steps [pilryohan chochi] regarding the replacement of 
fuel rods at a nuclear reactor. We have news from Vienna-based 
reporter Cha Man- sun: 
  [Begin Cha recording] A few minutes ago, the IAEA issued a 
special statement regarding North Korea's replacing fuel rods at 
the nuclear reactor. After assessing that it can take all 
necessary steps to implement the nuclear agreement in the 
initial stage of replacing fuel rods at the North Korean nuclear 
reactor, the IAEA has made an urgent proposal that it will 
immediately send a working- level delegation [silmu taepyodan] 
to North Korea to discuss the issue. 
  The IAEA has issued the statement because it believes that 
it 
cannot verify the conversion of nuclear materials by North Korea 
if North Korea continues changing fuel rods without taking any 
necessary steps -- such as taking samples from the spent fuel 
rods -- for the inspection team. 
  In particular, the IAEA warned that it has no alternative 
but 
to report to the IAEA Board of Governors, as well as to the UN 
Security Council, because North Korea's changing of fuel rods 
without taking any steps according to the nuclear agreement 
required by the IAEA is a grave violation of the agreement. 
  The IAEA has asked North Korea to immediately cooperate on 
necessary steps according to the nuclear agreement 
[haekhyopchongsang pilryohan chochie chukkak hyopcho] and, at 
the same time, urged it to delay changing the fuel rods. 
  Finally, the IAEA warned that it cannot but make a 
conclusion 
that it cannot verify the previous conversion of nuclear 
materials by North Korea [kwago pukhanui haekmulchil chonyongul] 
if North Korea continues changing fuel rods in the future. [end

  [Text] Washington, May 19 (YONHAP) -- International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors are continuing their activities 
at the North Korean nuclear complex in Yongbyon and nuclear fuel 
rods removed from the 5-megawatt reactor are being kept in the 
area, it was reported Thursday [19 May]. 
  Press reports that North Korea was not attempting to 
separate 
the spent nuclear fuel rods and preserve them for later 
inspection have not been confirmed, sources said. 
  The information received from Yongbyon thus far is that the 
inspection team has not encountered any problems, they added. 
  The inspectors would surely have raised this issue had North 
Korea moved the fuel rods elsewhere or handled them in any other 
way, they said. 
  "It appears that the spent fuel rods removed from the 
reactor 
are being kept in the area for later preservation and checks," 
one source said. 
  Since they are only part of the roughly 8,000 rods, it is 
difficult to say what can be done about the situation, they 
said, indicating that follow-up measures by the United States 
and South Korea depend largely on the North's attitude. 
  Even though Pyongyang has removed some fuel rods from the 
reactor, the issue will not be referred to the UN Security 
Council if it cooperates with the IAEA inspectors, they added.

    [Editorial Report] The Seoul weekly SISA JOURNAL, in its 
28 April edition on page 6 reported that the KILLIM SINMUN, a 
Korean-language newspaper published in Jilin, PRC, will become a 
message center for separated Korean families worldwide including 
both Koreas. The center could be operating as early as late May. 
  This three-times-a-week, eight page newspaper's main 
audience 
is the Jilin-area Korean-Chinese. However, it is read 
throughout China and reaches North and South Korea, Russia, 
Japan, the United States, and Canada. 
  This will be the third phase of the "Search for Separated 
Family Members" movement. The first was sponsored by the Korea 
Broadcasting System in the early 1980's, mainly for families in 
South Korea. The second was carried out by a private citizen 
dedicated to finding family members in South Korea and China. 
This effort, started in 1984, resolved nearly 2,700 cases. 
Although the KILLIM SINMUN-sponsored third phase will search 
worldwide, its main target is helping the thousands of separated 
North and South Koreans to find each other and exchange letters 
with families. 
  This movement was initiated by the chief of the RENMIN 
RIBAO's Seoul Bureau, Pyon Yong-u, who is also KILLIM SINMUN's 
special correspondent in Seoul. Pyon had hoped an opening 
before May, but that wasn't possible because of the frozen 
relationship between the two Koreas. 
  According to the SISA article, North Korea's reaction over 
Seoul's open criticism of North Korea's human rights stance and 
the Siberian loggers issue could delay things, but Pyon is 
optimistic. He is counting on Pyongyang's inability to stop 
KILLIM SINMUN from reaching North Koreans because of North 
Korea's relationship with China. Pyon plans to work closely 
with Cho Yong-sik, chairman of the Separated Families Reunion 
Promotion Committee in Seoul. 
  Notices for missing family members will be published as 
classified advertisements and costs will be paid by the 
sponsors. However, the names of sponsoring companies or 
individuals and the adresses of the families seeking missing 
members will not be printed as a precaution against possible 
harm to North Korean families by the Pyongyang government. Pyon 
told SISA that he hoped this effort would speed reunification.

  [Text] Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong last night called on 
industrial countries to ride on the growth of Asia and respond 
to it not as a threat, but as an opportunity to advance their 
own economic well-being. 
  This was a challenge which the Western nations must respond 
to positively, he said. "If they do not, and instead try to stem 
the flood tide, the challenge would turn into economic conflict 
and fragment the world into economic blocs -- the European 
Union, NAFTA and, perhaps, a new Asian bloc." 
  In a keynote speech to open The Asia Society's international 
business conference at the Shangri-La Hotel last night, he said 
Asia's time had come. ASEAN, China, India, Vietnam, even 
Myanmar [Burma] were opening up their economies. As China 
pushed through its economic reforms while India and Vietnam 
revamped their hitherto closed state-run economies, their impact 
on the global market would change the pattern of world trade and 
investment. 
  "As they grow, the pattern will change further. We will all 
have to adjust to their in creasing economic presence," he 
added. "Integrating these new giant producers into the world 
market is a major challenge." 
  Unfortunately, the West was ambivalent about Asia, and some 
Western leaders, politicians, trade unionists and opinion-makers 
saw Asia's emergence as a threat rather than an opportunity. 
  He said: "Attempts to check imports from low-wage countries, 
like the recent efforts to introduce social clauses on workers' 
rights and minimum wages into the GATT agenda, betray the West's 
fear of competition from Asia and its growing sense of economic 
insecurity. 
  "These thinly-veiled protectionist measures are 
short-sighted. They show a misguided preoccupation with 
preserving low-value jobs when the West should be concentrating 
on creating high-value jobs." 
  Mr. Goh said Western governments should resist changing the 
rules to curb Asia's growth. 
  "There is no alternative but to compete if Western countries 
want to maintain their edge in living standards over Asia and 
other developing countries." 
  Cheap imports from developing states did not cause the high 
unemployment problem in the West, he said, pointing out that 
Asia's economic emergence coincided with the prolonged recession 
in the industrialised countries. 
  "The relentless shift to wards new technologies is the major 
reason why those with out skills are losing their jobs. This 
will continue even if borders are sealed. It explains why the 
West is experiencing economic growth without corresponding job 
creation." 
  Mr. Goh said Western leaders must have the political will to 
overcome some "basic self-inflicted problems". 
  Europe was burdened with costly welfare systems, he said. 
The labour markets in Europe had become too rigid, and laws 
inhibited rather than promoted growth. 
  The bottom segment of workers in the United States and 
Europe 
were also under educated and under-trained. 
  He said: "The West needs to solve its structural problems 
now, while it still has the trump card on technology and 
know-how. 
  "If it does not strive to stay ahead, it will find that in 
another generation, even this competitive advantage may be lost. 
Asia will catch up fast with the West in levels of education and 
skills." 
  He noted that Asia, with its growing affluence, was becoming 
a huge market for consumer goods, travel and other economic 
services. Asia had already overtaken Europe as the leading 
export market for the US, accounting for over a quarter of US 
exports by 1992, he said. 
  By the end of the decade there would be some 400 million 
Asians with purchasing power equal to the average Westerner 
today. 
  If, despite these benefits the West continued to see Asia as 
a threat and tried to slow its growth, both Asia and the West 
would lose. 
  "If the West blocks the emerging Asian countries, especially 
China from world markets, it will force them to turn inward. 
They will be less open and be less co-operative internationally. 
  "Their weaker economic growth would translate into a more 
aggressive and destabilising military posture because they would 
distrust the West. 
  "The West will be threatened not merely by the loss of 
exports and slower domestic growth, but with global insecurity, 
including the risks of losing the assets it already has in Asia." 
  There would be similar negative effects if the European 
Union 
looked only inward and the North American Free Trade Area 
(NAFTA) only southward, he warned. 
  "If they do, Asians will have to organise themselves and 
trade increasingly among themselves. The region's diversity in 
natural resources, wage levels, skills and technology will allow 
for continued expansion of intra-regional trade and investment. 
  "Asia has the capital. It saves more than the rest of the 
world. Its growth will be slowed, but it will not be stopped. 
An Asian trade bloc is not an option of choice. But it is a 
viable option. And sometime in the next century, Asia, by its 
sheer size, would shift the weight of global economic power from 
the West to the East." 
  Whichever the scenario, he said, the West would have much to 
lose by not being a partner in Asia's growth. 
  "An economically-powerful Asia which is not integrated with 
the rest of the world will be sullen and ready to challenge the 
West. 
  "An Asia made prosperous with the help of the West will want 
that beneficial relationship to continue." 
  Citing Germany and Japan as examples, Mr. Goh said the 
wisdom 
of America's policy to help its World War II adversaries after 
the war was obvious. 
  They were now America's allies. "Likewise, the US can help 
China, India, Vietnam and the rest of Asia integrate with the 
West by investing in them, selling to them and buying from 
them," he said. 
  "This will lead to an interdependent world economically and 
politically. When the West and Asia reinforce each other's 
strengths and take a stake in each other's stability, prosperity 
and future, it is a much better world."

  [Text] Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim 
yesterday told the West to stop lecturing and hectoring 
developing countries. 
  "Give us a break," he said. "To allow ourselves to be 
lectured and hectored on freedom and human rights after 100 
years of struggle to regain our own liberty and human dignity, 
by those who participated in or benefited from our subjugation, 
is to willingly suffer impudence." 
  Datuk Sri Anwar was speaking at The Asia Society's business 
conference at Shangri-La Hotel. He said that the debate between 
the developed and developing world had not achieved anything 
because of the "cultural arrogance" of the West. "There are 
those who consider they still have a civilising mission in Asia, 
namely to sermonise Asians about freedom and human rights." 
  Datuk Sri Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, acknowledged 
that Asia had to catch up in many areas. Countries like China 
and Vietnam had adjusted to join the world community. But 
Europe and North America had to contend with a host of economic, 
social and political problems in recent years, he said. 
  "While Asian countries have made the necessary adjustments, 
the West too need the will and vision to steer their societies 
out of the present morass."

  [Text] Malaysia's deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, 
says there is a need for greater rapport and dialogue between 
East and West on equal terms, and he thinks there are enough 
elements in the West which are beginning to accept this. Datuk 
Sri Anwar, who was in Singapore to attend an international 
conference here, was speaking at a news conference before 
returning to Malaysia. He said Asian countries should not just 
talk about moral decadence of the West. Instead, they also need 
to address their own excesses and to recognize growing demand 
for greater openness and accountability. Datuk Anwar said he 
was worried people would think that progress can be measured 
purely by economic indices. He said the Asian renaissance he 
has spoken of would also have a cultural and moral dimension. 
  Datuk Anwar also spoke informally with Prime Minister Goh 
Chok Tong at a dinner last night. Referring to Mr. Goh's 
comments that he would welcome the North American Free Trade 
Agreement being extended to Asian countries, Datuk Anwar said he 
would bring this up with Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed. 
  Turning to a suggestion for a link between the ASEAN Free 
Trade Agreement [AFTA] and Australia and New Zealand, Datuk 
Anwar said ASEAN needs to get AFTA set up first. Then only can 
arrangements or synergy with others in the subregion be 
considered. 
  Datuk Anwar also said Malaysia is supportive of the peace 
process in the Middle East. Assuming the process continues and 
there is a final settlement between Israel and the PLO, Malaysia 
is open to an early recognition of Israel and normalization of 
relations.

Do Quoc Sam said Vietnam needs about $50 billion in the next six 
years in order to develop its economy. This sum is expected 
from foreign aid and loans, with half used in services and 
building infrastructure. Only 12 percent will be allocated for 
agriculture and 38 percent for industrial development.

  [Text] The approach and pace in dealing with regional 
security issues topped the agenda yesterday as senior officials 
began a special preparatory meeting for the ASEAN Regional Forum 
(ARF) being launched in Thailand in July. Much time was spent 
sorting out two schools of thought put forward by Western 
countries which advocate development of the ARF as a 
results-oriented forum, and Asian countries which advocate a 
slower and more general approach to dealing with security. 
  Specific security concerns in the region, proliferation of 
nuclear and biological/chemical weapons in the Korean peninsula, 
the dispute over the Spratly Islands, Cambodia and Burma were 
mentioned but not discussed at length yesterday. 
  Deputy permanent secretary for foreign affairs Sarot 
Chawanawirat told reporters the four hot topics were raised with 
the aim to work out a regional strategy to resolve them without 
blaming any party involved. The senior officials were in 
Bangkok to prepare for the ARF in July and not to try to resolve 
the four issues, sources stressed. 
  Foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) announced the advent of the ARF at their annual 
meeting last year. ARF participants will include the six ASEAN 
member states -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, 
Singapore and Thailand, their seven dialogue partners, plus 
observers and consultative partners. The United States, Canada, 
Australia, New Zealand, the European Community, Japan and South 
Korea are ASEAN's dialogue partners. China and Russia are 
consultative partners, while Laos, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea 
are observers. 
  ASEAN sources stressed that the ARF is meant to be an 
informal, consultative forum for discussing regional political 
and security cooperation in Asia and the Pacific. It is not 
meant to replace existing international or regional mechanisms 
dealing with security issues. ASEAN's position is that the 
ARF's development as a forum should be "slow but sure," Thai 
permanent secretary for foreign affairs Pracha Khunakasem told 
reporters. All participating countries should feel comfortable 
with it. 
  Security was complex and had to be dealt with step by step 
as 
a certain issue developed, Mr Pracha said. 
  "ARF is a new constructive experiment; it's like a newborn 
baby, we have to nurture it," he said. "Foreign affairs is 
difficult to quantify. We have no control because the events 
happen outside our country and the only thing we can do is to 
have an open dialogue (with the countries concerned)," he said. 
  A U.S. official said ARF could develop step by step but 
there 
must be movement and results. A senior Russian official 
expressed optimism that all 18 countries will be able to reach a 
consensus on the issue by the time three days of preparatory 
talks end tomorrow. 
  "I believe a melange (a mix) will be reached between East 
and 
West on the approach and speed at the end of the meeting, 
because without consensus, we cannot deal with security issues," 
he said. 
  A Canadian delegate said Canada would like to see the forum 
play an important role in strengthening peace and security in 
the region. The forum should be institutionalized to allow 
participants "to meet each year to be able to discuss issues in 
order to prevent situations from further deteriorating," the 
official said. 
  South Korea supported a forum to meet once a year and it 
should be a supplement for existing dialogues between Seoul and 
its partners, a senior South Korean official said. "We are 
going to have some more supplements which might be conducive to 
further stabilizing peace and security in the future," the 
official said. 
  Mr Pracha said the participating countries had already 
agreed 
that ARF at foreign minister level would meet annually with the 
six ASEAN members taking turns in hosting the meeting. He said 
the meeting in Bangkok would last three hours on July 25 with a 
working dinner. 
  A so-called chairman's statement by Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri will be released at the end of the meeting. Sqd Ldr 
[Squadron Leader] Prasong will set the parameters of the 
three-hour talks around Asia-Pacific security issues, preventive 
diplomacy and confidence building.

  [Text] South Korea yesterday proposed a "multilateral 
framework" for security in Northeast Asia as senior officials 
convened for the first multilateral discussion on security in 
Southeast Asia. 
  "We have in mind the establishment of a Northeast Asia 
security dialogue which will go in tandem with the ASEAN 
Regional Forum," South Korea's Assistant Minister for Foreign 
Affairs Yi Chang-chun told reporters. "Our idea, however, is in 
the formative stage. We have yet to develop it," he added. 
  Mr Yi made the remarks before South Korea's paper on 
security 
cooperation was to be discussed yesterday afternoon by officials 
convened at the special preparatory meeting for the ASEAN 
Regional Forum being held in July. Citing historical realities, 
difference in political systems and economic development, the 
paper advocated a "gradual approach" to multilateral security 
cooperation in Northeast Asia. The paper stressed the need for 
respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-aggression 
and restraint. It also emphasized the need to remove mutual 
distrust and build mutual confidence. The paper argued for 
regional cooperation to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  "While making continued efforts to resolve North Korea's 
nuclear issue within the existing framework and on the basis of 
international consensus, cooperation among the countries in the 
region is needed to strengthen the global regimes for the 
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction," the paper 
said. "Regional cooperation is also needed in other fields of 
arms control, including the regulation of missile technology," 
the paper added. But preventive diplomacy, particularly 
conflict prevention, is crucial to security cooperation in 
Northeast Asia, it went on. 
  For the benefit of "enhancing transparency," the South 
Korean 
paper called for exchange and discussion of defense white 
papers, provision of data to the United Nations Register of 
Conventional Arms, regular meetings of defense officials, and 
exchange visits of military personnel and of naval vessels. The 
paper also suggested cooperation in non-combat activities, joint 
training programs and participation in UN peacekeeping 
operations.

  [Text] Australia has proposed a limited exchange of 
military information as part of "trust-building" measures among 
countries in the Asia-Pacific region. According to the first 
draft of a paper presented to a meeting yesterday, Australia 
proposed exchange of data on military strategy, doctrine and 
defense budgets, as well as "information on current and planned 
force acquisitions, and military orders-of-battle". 
  The Australian paper was presented and discussed yesterday 
at 
the special meeting toward the ASEAN Regional Forum being 
launched in Bangkok in July. The paper was commissioned by 
senior officials of ASEAN and their dialogue partners who met in 
Singapore last year. 
  Australia also proposed the setting up of a regional 
security 
studies center, a maritime information database, strategic 
planning exchanges and the posting of observers at military 
exercises as part of the "trust-building measures". 
  The studies center could serve as the repository for 
information supplied by regional governments which could then be 
disseminated on a non-official basis to other institutes and 
governments, said the draft obtained by the BANGKOK POST. The 
maritime data base could be attached to the studies center and 
offer information on maritime traffic, environmental issues, 
piracy and smuggling, the draft said. 
  Regular planning exchanges "could provide an opportunity to 
exchange perceptions on strategic and military developments, to 
discuss issues of common concern, and to consider opportunities 
for practical co-operation," the draft said. The draft argues 
for "observers from other regional powers" to be present at 
military exercises which have so far been primarily bilateral or 
trilateral. Australia in fact was commissioned to produce a 
paper on confidence building measures applicable to the region, 
an official said. But Australia decided to use the word trust 
instead because confidence-building is seen as a Cold War term. 
  "We want to have a clean start," an Australian official 
said.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
prefers the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to 
remain an informal grouping but it will have no choice but to go 
along if other member countries want it to be otherwise, Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Monday. He said if the other 
APEC member countries wanted the grouping to have a permanent 
secretariat and have their leaders meet every year, then 
Malaysia would have to allow itself to be dragged along. 
  Dr. Mahathir was replying to a question during the 
question-and-answer session after delivering a keynote address 
at the 27th International General Meeting of the Pacific Basin 
Economic Council (PBEC) here. He maintained, however, that APEC 
meetings should not be institutionalised. 
  I feel, at this point of time, APEC should be a loose 
organisation so that we can get to know each other better and 
even if the leaders (of APEC countries) want to meet once a 
while, then I think it's o.k., he said. For the time being, the 
leaders should not meet so often (but should instead) leave it 
to the bureaucrats and the ministers to take care of the 
problems; Dr. Mahathir said when the idea of APEC was mooted, 
Malaysia was very concerned that the powerful member countries 
would impose their will on the weak members. APEC, the world's 
biggest regional grouping, links 18 Pacific rim countries 
including North America, Australia and New Zealand. 
  Later, speaking to reporters, Dr. Mahathir said he will 
attend the APEC informal summit in Jakarta in November.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 24 -- Prime Minister [P.M.] Vo Van 
Kiet is attending the 27th International General Meeting of the 
Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) which opened in Kuala 
Lumpur on May 23. 
  Addressing the three-day meeting, P.M. Kiet said that the 
dynamic development of the Pacific economies has not only 
brought about well-being for the regional people, but also 
created favourable opportunities for the business circle all 
over the world, with a population of billions, East Asia and 
Southeast Asia is a large market, a big source of labour. 
Especially, the people in the region have a tradition of 
hard-working, education and skillfulness. 
  The Vietnamese prime minister noted that `the social and 
political stability in each country, the trend for peace and 
cooperation in the region have created a reliable environment 
for business. 
  He said that the trend for regionalization in combination 
with that for globalization is developing including Malaysia's 
initiative on the East Asia Economic Cooperation forum. This 
has further strengthened the business opportunities in the 
Pacific, he added. 
  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet expressed the hope that this 
trend 
would not lead to confrontation between the economic blocks and 
closed trade, but step up the broadening of regionalization. 
  The Vietnamese leader went on: 
  `Realizing new opportunities and challenges for the 
developing countries including Vietnam, in recent years we have 
maintained our reform policy developed the market-oriented 
economy and broadened its cooperation with foreign countries. 
  `The achievements recorded in our renovation process have 
helped us gradually stabilize the country's economic development 
process, and at the same time create a new opportunities for 
foreign and Vietnamese businessmen. Nowadays, Vietnam's economy 
keeps on growing, inflation has been driven back, and export 
value and foreign investment increased rapidly. Political and 
social stability has been improved, thus creating a favourable 
environment for foreign and Vietnamese investors. 
  `At present, we are trying to take our country into a new 
stage of development, step by step implementing 
industrialization and modernisation. We have great demands for 
capital, technology, experience in managements and business. 
These are new opportunities for foreign businessmen and 
investors. 
  Mr. Kiet continued `great efforts have been made to improve 
Vietnam's infrastructure. Most of foreign aid has been used for 
upgrading and building roads, sea ports, airports, water and 
electricity supply systems, and so on, many opportunities have 
appeared for foreign businessmen to take part in Vietnam's 
development process in various forms of bidding, investment 
capital contribution, and build-operate-transfer (BOT)'. 
  `A great favourable condition for us and foreign 
businessmen' 
he noted, `is Vietnam's external relations which are broadened 
rapidly. At present, Vietnam has fine relations with all 
neighbours. It is actively preparing to join ASEAN as full 
member and take part in the Pacific institutions. Vietnam has 
established its normal relations of cooperation with 
international organizations,and strengthened its relations with 
most countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and 
America'. 
  `The new dynamic of Vietnam's economy which is promoted by 
the dynamics in the Pacific region, and the country's foreign 
policy of openness, diversification and multilaterization of 
relationship is creating new opportunities of business', he 
concluded.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 23 (CNA) -- Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet said here Monday [23 May] he hopes to visit 
Taiwan. 
  "I look forward to visiting Taiwan to see for myself the 
general situation there, but so far I have not received any 
invitation from Taiwan," Vo said after attending the opening 
session of the 27th annual meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic 
Council (PBEC). 
  Many Taiwan officials and business leaders, including 
Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang and Chairman Ting Shan-li 
of the Kuomintang-owned Central Trade and Investment Co., have 
met with Vo in Vietnam during the past year. A number of 
Vietnamese officials, including the head of its Prime Minister's 
Office, have also visited Taiwan in recent years. 
  Despite the absence of diplomatic ties, substantive 
relations 
between Taiwan and Vietnam have grown steadily since the late 
1980s. Taiwan is now Vietnam's largest source of foreign 
capital, with an aggregate direct investment of about U.S.$1.6 
billion. 
  Vo said he hopes Taipei-Hanoi economic cooperation can be 
further strengthened. 
  Vo arrived in Kuala Lumpur Sunday to attend the opening 
ceremony of the May 21-25 annual meeting of the PBEC, a 
non-governmental forum for bankers and business leaders from 
Pacific Basin countries to exchange views and forge cooperative 
ties.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Ali Alatas stressed that Indonesia 
is not a mediator in the Korean peninsula's nuclear issue, but 
can only hear the issues from the involved parties through 
diplomatic methods. Speaking at a news conference with his 
South Korean counterpart, Han Sung-chu, Minister Ali Alatas said 
Indonesia, as a neighboring nation and in its capacity as the 
leader of the Nonaligned Movement, can only make an effort to 
hold a dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
IAEA, North and South Korea, and other parties such as the 
United States, Japan, and China. Indonesia hopes that through 
such dialogue the Korean peninsula's crisis can be fully settled 
without aggression. 
  Meanwhile, the South Korean foreign minister also hoped that 
the conflict, which has become a concern in the international 
community, can be fully solved.

North Korean nuclear problem at the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) 
foreign ministers' meeting next week in Cairo. 
  Receiving South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu at the

  [Text] President Suharto appreciated the decision of 
Philippine President Fidel Ramos to bar foreigners from 
attending the so-called Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor. 
President Ramos' move showed that the Philippine Government put 
friendly relations with Indonesia above a conference which 
obviously is intended to attack Indonesia. Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas said this after accompanying his South Korean 
counterpart, Han Sung-chu, during a courtesy call on President 
Suharto at Merdeka Palace this afternoon. 
  Meanwhile, Minister and State Secretary Murdiono separately 
disclosed the Indonesian Government's appreciation of President 
Ramos' stand. 
  [Begin Murdiono recording] The government appreciates the 
move taken by President Ramos as this reflects the Philippines' 
profound understanding of our stand on the East Timor issue. 
For us, the East Timor issue is over and East Timor is part of 
the Republic of Indonesia. As proof, the people of East Timor 
have taken part several times in general elections as Indonesian 
citizens. [end recording] 
  The Philippine president announced several days ago the 
decision to bar foreigners from attending the conference 
organized by several Philippine non-government organizations to 
discuss the East Timor issue.

<F P=106> [From the prees review] </F>
  [Text] SUARA KARYA says the decision of Philippine 
President Fidel Ramos to bar foreigners from attending a 
conference on East Timor, which is scheduled to be held at the 
end of this month, has greatly appeased the Indonesian people. 
The daily, however, adds that the decision has not completely 
resolved the matter. If the conference does take place even 
without foreign participants, this will create an impression 
that the University of the Philippines as an academic 
institution has allowed itself to be reduced to a forum to 
conduct political campaigns, which may in turn trigger an 
international problem. Not a few of the Indonesian alumni of 
the University of the Philippines have contributed to efforts to 
enhance the bonds of friendship between the two nations and 
peoples. 
  KOMPAS says the decision showed the courageous leadership of 
President Ramos because the Philippine president has put his 
popularity at risk. Ramos is convinced that national interests 
supersede the interests of a few of his fellow countrymen. 
According to the daily, Ramos is well aware that the decision 
was something unusual under the Philippines' democratic 
political culture which accords wide freedom to such 
institutions like campuses to discuss anything, including one 
critical of the government. Nevertheless, President Ramos as a 
leader wisely anticipated a greater controversy if he had done 
nothing to downplay the planned conference on East Timor. 
  The daily BERITA BUANA says the Philippine Government should 
be aware of Indonesia's stand on East Timor. Even if the 
conference on East Timor does take place in the Philippines, the 
Philippine Government will have to actively offer a clear and 
detailed explanation on Indonesia's stand, the essence of which 
is that East Timor has become the 27th province of the Republic 
of Indonesia. The Philippines should at least dismiss the 
results of the conference on East Timor and prevent them from 
misleading public opinion.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 22 (ANTARA) -- The Czech Government 
will help promote Indonesian export products to the East 
European country with a view to correct the imbalance of trade 
between the two countries which last year was in Indonesia's 
disfavour involving four million US dollars. 
  The promotion through a trade fair was expected to be one 
way 
of exploiting the potentials of the Czech market, said Czech 
Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy upon arrival in 
Jakarta Sunday. 
  Through the exhibition in that country, the public and 
businessmen there will have the opportunity to know more about 
Indonesian manufactured and plantation products, Dlouhy said at 
the Sukarno-Hatta International Airport where he was greeted by 
Director General of Foreign Trade Joko Mulyono. 
  Last year, Indonesia's exports to the East European country 
reached a value of 10.5 million US dollars and the imports from 
that country were estimated at 14.5 million dollars. 
  Another way which would be tried, according to the first 
Czech high government official who visited Indonesia, would be 
to increase the meetings between the businessmen of the two 
countries to enable them to know their respective market 
potentials. 
  He said his mission to Indonesia included 25 businessmen of 
major companies engaged in the automotive, aviation, steel, road 
construction, textile, funding, rubber, chemicals, cement and 
engineering industries. 
  They were expected to explore possibilities of trade and 
investment between the two countries, he added. 
  Indonesia's export commodities to the East European country 
included textile, tin and natural rubber, while the commodities 
imported from that country included machinery and chemicals. 
  On the occasion, Dlouhy said during his stay in Indonesia he 
was also scheduled to sign a new trade agreement between the two 
countries after Czechoslovakia split into two. 
  The Czech officials will also discuss matters relating to 
investment guarantee and the prevention of double taxation with 
Indonesian Government authorities. 
  While in Indonesia from May 22 through 25, Dlouhy will meet 
Coordinating Minister for Industry and Trade Hartarto, Trade 
Minister Judono, State Minister for National Development 
Planning/Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency 
(Bappenas) Ginanjar Kartasasmita, Finance Minister Mar'ie 
Mohammad, Bank Indonesia Governor Sudrajad Jiwandono, head of 
the National Agency for Export Promotion (BPEN) and the board of 
the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN). 
  In the meantime, third secretary of the Czech Embassy in 
Jakarta Zdenek Darebnik [name as received] said trade between 
the two countries can now be conducted by l/c [letter of credit] 
and payment with the US dollar as hard currency. 
  He said the dispatch of goods from Indonesia to his country 
no longer posed a problem to the trade between the two countries 
because the Czech airline company also made a stopover at 
Singapore. 
  The shipment of goods by sea can also be carried out via the 
ports in Germany and Poland, he said.

  [Text] Batam, Riau, May 23 (ANTARA) -- Indonesian [RI] and 
PNG (Papua New Guinea) officials Monday began a two-day meeting 
here Monday to discuss security in their common border regions. 
  The chief Indonesian delegate, Brig. Gen. Cholid Ghozali, in 
remarks at the meeting's opening, said the gathering was an 
opportunity to formulate better ways of maintaining security and 
stability along the border shared by the two countries. 
  He said talks at the meeting would also touch on the 
implementation of certain portions of a memorandum of 
understanding between the two countries on the establishment of 
their sub-committee on border security. 
  Formation of the sub-committee on border security was 
decided 
at a meeting of the Indonesia-PNG Joint Border Committee held in 
Rabaul last year, he noted. 
  The leader of the PNG delegation, Colonel Andrew Trongat, 
meanwhile said the meeting would try to find ways of improving 
security in the border region where a number of small incidents 
had taken place. 
  Overall security in the border region, however, was "good", 
he said. 
  What the present meeting had to try to accomplish was better 
coordination between security agencies on both sides of the 
border to minimize the occurrence of incidents, Trongat said. 
  Security in RI-PNG border regions was in the past sometimes 
stirred by Indonesians crossing the border into PNG territory 
instigated by the security disturbing movement, GPK. 
  Irian Jaya Governor Jacob Pattipi said recently these people 
had been deceived by hollow promises of a better life. 
  Most of the border-crossers had now returned to their home 
villages in Irian Jaya with the assistance of the PNG 
government, he said.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 23 (ANTARA) -- Foreign Minister Ali 
Alatas stated here on Monday that the uncertainty of schedule 
for the Moro talks should not be understood as implying that 
Indonesia wished to stop the talks as this had happened merely 
because each side had been held back with its own business. 
  "I have never stated that the talks would be stopped. What 
causes a delay is the search for a suitable time for all sides," 
he said. 
  The planned talks between the Moro National Liberation Front 
(MNLF) and the Philippine Government involving Indonesia as the 
facilitator which has been scheduled on May 17 have been 
postponed indefinitely. 
  Analysts said this must have to do with the planned holding 
of a conference on "Asia Pacific Conference on East Timor" in 
the Philippines on May 31-June 3. 
  "We are still seeking the right time. Besides preparations 
at technical level also have not yet finished. That's why it is 
postponed," he said. 
  Alatas however assured that the talks would be held this 
year. Alatas would not give much comment regarding a 
Muhammadiyah leader's idea to conduct a seminar on Moro similar 
to that of the planned East Timor conference in the Philippines. 
"That was Lukman Harun's idea," he said. 
  Alatas stated that it was not necessary for Indonesia to 
send 
people to the East Timor conference adding that no officials of 
the Indonesian embassy in Manila were invited. He appreciated 
President Ramos' decision to ban foreign participants and 
speakers to take part in the conference. 
  "Now the conference is internal in nature, attended only by 
the Philippine people. Now this is their own business and we 
have no right to give our own judgement," he said. 
  Alatas reiterated that the conference was not merely a 
conference in the Philippines, held with the Philippines but a 
conference fully planned and engineered by Ramon Horta and his 
associates. "I have the evidence," he added. 
  He said this conference would not talk in general about 
human 
rights but would be political, aimed at tarnishing the 
Indonesian name leading to disrupting Indonesia's territorial 
integrity. 
  Asked about a report, carried by Portugal daily LNSA, that 
Indonesia plans to deport Fretilin leader Xanana Gusmao abroad. 
Alatas said that "This is a clear disinformation to lead us into 
a [word indistinct]." 
  "Our enemy is getting wilder, they see there have been the 
Indonesia-Portugal Friendship Association, the Europe-Indonesia 
Parliamentary Association. Room for maneuver for Ramon Horta 
and his fellows is getting narrower and so they are getting 
wilder," Alatas said.

  [Text] Jakarta, May 18 (OANA-ANTARA) -- The Central 
Jakarta District Court on Wednesday sentenced 21 students each 
to six months minus detention time after they were proven guilty 
of insulting the head of state. 
  Although they would only have to stay in jail for a month, 
the students immediately made it known they would appeal the 
verdict. 
  In passing the sentences, the presiding judge of each group 
trial said the students together had been guilty of deliberately 
damaging the dignity, honor, and the good reputation of the 
president in a demonstration at the Parliament building on 
December 14. 
  During the demonstration the students had put up banners, 
posters, shouted yells, and sung songs containing insults to the 
president, the judges said. 
  The court, however, acquitted them from the prosecutor's 
accusation that they had also insulted the authorities and 
official bodies. 
  Scores of students attending the trial shouted everytime the 
judges read out the verdicts. 
  Nine students were held by the police for putting up posters 
Wednesday morning before the trial session began. 
  During the session, some students held a "mock" trial 
accentuated by yells and patriotic songs. The action was joined 
by hundreds of students and proceeded peacefully and orderly. 
  According to one of the students' lawyers, Frans Hendra 
Winata, the verdict was the lightest ever handed down in 
political cases of the category during the new order era. 
  "Bonar Tigor and Nuku Suleiman were sentenced to years of 
imprisonment," Winata said referring to political cases settled 
in court just weeks before the students'.

<F P=106> ["The U.S., Chieftain of Terrorism, Should Mind Its Own </F>
Business, FM Spokesman" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the 
Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
released a statement today denouncing the annual report on 
terrorism recently published by the U.S. State Department, which 
brands the DPRK as "a terrorist state", citing totally distorted 
and faked materials. 
  He says: 
  The U.S. Administration publishes an annual report on 
terrorism every year, putting the label of "terrorism" on other 
nations which do not meekly obey it. This is a customary 
practice for veiling its ill fame as the biggest breeding ground 
of state and individual terrorism. 
  Today the DPRK is the main target of U.S. terrorism. The 
United States has persistently hatched every conceivable plot 
against it. 
  The U.S. State Department abused the DPRK again over "the 
terrorist issue". It is an anachronistic act based on the U.S. 
hostile policy for impairing the image of the DPRK and stifling 
it, as it has done over "the nuclear issue." 
  The DPRK rejects all manner of terrorism, proceeding from 
the 
fundamental principle of the chuche idea that sets greatest 
store by human dignity and value. It also opposes any act 
encouraging and supporting terrorism. The world community well 
knows of this. 
  The United States, known as the chieftain of terrorism, 
should mind its own business, instead of impudently trying to 
brand other nations as "terrorist states." This would be better 
for the United States itself.

<F P=106> ["Press Statement" by the Foreign Ministry spokesman -- </F>
announcer-read] 
  [Text] A spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry released 
today the following press statement on the situation concerning 
the Korean peninsula recently turning in an unusual direction 
with each passing day [choson pandoui chubyon chongsega narul 
ttara simsangchi anun panghyanguro umjigigo innungotkkwa 
kwallyonhaeso]: 
  The situation around the Korean peninsula has recently been 
turning in an unusual direction with each passing day. 
According to reports, Rimpac -- a Pacific-rim exercise in which 
the U.S., Japanese, and South Korean Armed Forces will join -- 
is going to be held in the West Pacific Ocean near our country 
for about 50 days, from late May to mid-July. Reports say 
large-scale Armed Forces -- including two U.S. aircraft carriers 
in addition to some 60 Navy vessels, some 200 airplanes, and 
some 25,000 troops from the three countries, with the U.S. Naval 
forces as the base -- will be mobilized for this exercise. 
  The Naval forces of the United States, Japan and the South 
Korean puppets plan to form the first unified fleet ever in 
history and stage a joint operation against fleets of other 
countries. 
  This is a military action which must not go unnoticed in 
view 
of the arms buildup the United States is forcing in South Korea 
while seeking sanctions against the DPRK over its fictitious 
nuclear issue. 
  The joint operation is going to be staged by a unified fleet 
this time while the military bosses of the United States, Japan, 
and South Korea are holding aggressive confabs repeatedly 
against the DPRK, visiting each other frequently. This is vivid 
proof that the three-way military alliance with the United 
States as the axis, which was formed long ago for stifling the 
DPRK and other Asian socialist countries, is stepping into the 
stage of practical action. 
  We cannot but be alerted against the United States bringing 
into the open through such joint operation its intention to 
force the military action against the DPRK, come what may. 
  The Korean people are not afraid of anyone's military action 
but are prepared to counter the U.S.-orchestrated multinational 
military action [migugi chudohanun tagukchogin kunsahaendongedo 
teachohalsu innun]. 
  The dangerous military situation created in and around the 
Korean peninsula today proves the validity and opportuneness 
[chongdanghago sigijokcholhadanun] of the overture of the DPRK 
for negotiations to establish a durable peace arrangement that 
will replace the military armistice machine in Korea and 
urgently demands its early realization. 
  The United States must know that it is a reasonable act 
either in view of the interests of the United States itself or 
in view of the guarantee of regional peace to respond to the 
peaceful overture of the DPRK, instead of taking adventurous 
military actions against it with the mobilization of its 
satellites. 
  Otherwise, the DPRK will no longer be able to discharge its 
duties under the Korean Armistice Agreement, and the United 
States must know this.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Talk: "Intolerable Maneuvers of Puppets' </F>
Nuclear Weapons Development"] 
  [Text] At the moment, the South Korean puppets are pushing 
ahead, in earnest, with nuclear weapons development and 
ruthlessly conducting more anti-Republic maneuvers than ever 
before, while finding fault with our Republic's so-called 
nuclear issue. 
  As has been revealed to the world, the South Korean ruling 
bunch has been developing nuclear weapons ever since it 
manufactured atomic reactors for military purposes a long time 
ago under the guise of commercial use and use in research. 
Today, the rascals are going so far as to talk openly about 
nuclear sovereignty. 
  South Koreans involved in nuclear development have also 
confessed that the heavy-water reactor in Wolsong and the 
multipurpose research reactor in Taedok were introduced for 
purposes of nuclear weapons development. And, publications in 
South Korea have also revealed that plans to produce nuclear 
weapons have been pushed ahead endlessly by South Korea. 
  As is known, the South Korean ruling bunch made it a policy 
to develop nuclear weapons by the early 1970's. They imported a 
heavy-water reactor from Canada with a view to securing 
fissionables and installed it in Wolsong. 
  The South Korean puppet clique publicized that the Wolsong 
heavy-water reactor was for power generation purposes. But, a 
publication in South Korea revealed the truth by saying that the 
Wolsong heavy-water reactor that was imported from Canada was 
for manufacturing nuclear weapons and for producing plutonium. 
  The South Korean ruling bunch has also been introducing in a 
legal way, enriched uranium from a foreign country after having 
designed and manufactured the Taedok multipurpose research 
reactor suitable for using enriched uranium. By installing a 
new test laboratory for irridation materials, they established a 
semi-reprocessing facility where they can produce plutonium 
directly from used nuclear fuel. 
  In South Korea, the development of nuclear weapons has been 
carried out in a more earnest way since the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
regime was inaugurated. Already a year ago, the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique called on the National Assembly to raise its voice 
against the possession of nuclear weapons as it nullified the 
principle of the South-North Joint Declaration on 
Denuclearization. Some time ago, traitor Kim Yong-sam himself 
even concluded an agreemeent aimed at pushing ahead with nuclear 
development hand in hand with Japan. 
  This fully shows how enthusiastic the South Korean puppets 
are in their maneuvers to develop nuclear weapons. South 
Korea's nuclear weapons development, which has actually reached 
a dangerous stage, was possible because of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]'s double standard of not publicizing 
and overlooking the results of nuclear inspections there, while 
finding fault with our peaceful nuclear facilities. 
  It is by no chance that THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, a 
U.S. publication, revealed that South Korea is implementing its 
ambitious nuclear plans with the connivance of the IAEA. 
  Not satisfied with having made South Korea the Far East's 
largest nuclear powder magazine by introducing some 1,000 U.S. 
nuclear weapons, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is maneuvering 
to frantically accelerate its own nuclear weapons development. 
Such an act is a downright breach of faith nullifying the joint 
declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and 
an implacable, serious crime aimed at annihilating the nation. 
  As is known to the whole world, in the second round 
Korea-U.S. talks, we put forth an epoch-making proposal of 
replacing the graphite-moderated atomic reactor with a 
light-water reactor. Thus, we showed the transparency of 
peaceful nuclear activities and have made all sincere efforts to 
find a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  Therefore, if the South Korean ruling bunch has a sincere 
intention to make the Korean peninsula a nuclear-free, peace 
zone, it should make clear, and beg forgiveness, at home and 
abroad, even now, that the heavy-water reactor, the multipurpose 
research reactor, and the fast-breeder reactor are for 
developing nuclear weapons, and should take measures to scrape 
them. 
  If the South Korean puppets continue to accelerate nuclear 
weapons development that will cause tremendous catastrophe to 
the nation, despite strong protest and denunciation of people at 
home and abroad, they will not be able to avoid the rigorous 
judgment of the times and history. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should clearly understand 
this 
and act with discretion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The Korean National 
Peace Committee sent a letter to the World Peace Council on May 
18, which called upon the council to take a serious view of the 
criminal nuclear development by the South Korean authorities and 
lift up the voice informing the world community of it. 
  Noting that the United States invented "nuclear suspicion" 
against the DPRK, describing its 5 megawatt experimental nuclear 
power station as one for the development of nuclear arms, and 
has escalated the anti-DPRK campaign over the "nuclear issue," 
the letter said: 
  The one posing a nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula is 
not the DPRK, a non-nuclear state, but the United States which 
deployed over 1,000 nuclear weapons in South Korea and is hell 
bent on nuclear war exercises directed against the North. What 
is used for nuclear development is not the North's 5-megawatt 
experimental nuclear power station but the heavy water reactor 
and the multipurpose research reactor in South Korea. 
  As South Korean officials in charge of nuclear development 
confessed, the Wolsong heavy water reactor disguised as a 
reactor for "commercial use" and the Taedok multipurpose atomic 
reactor disguised as one for "research", were introduced for the 
purpose of developing nuclear weapons. 
  South Korea is now producing a large quantity of plutonium 
through those reactors. The Wolsong heavy water reactor has 
produced plutonium enough to make 370 or more nuclear bombs 
after it started operation in 1983. Nevertheless, the nuclear 
development in South Korea has not been taken seriously in the 
international community. This is because of the deliberate 
connivance of the United States and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency and their biased act aimed at stifling the DPRK. 
  We consider that the South Korean authorities' nuclear arms 
development can never be tolerated in view of peace in Asia and 
the rest of the world or of the World Peace Council's idea of 
building a nuclear-free world. 
  It is the primary requisite to the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula for the South Korean authorities to give up 
their nuclear arms development and dismantle the heavy water 
reactor and the multipurpose research reactor designed for the 
development of nuclear arms. 
  Since the DPRK Government expressed its willingness to 
replace its graphite-moderated experimental power reactor with a 
light-water reactor, they must clearly state to the world public 
their willingness to scrap the heavy water reactor and the 
multipurpose research reactor which are being used in developing 
nuclear weapons. 
  For the Korean peninsula to be turned into a nuclear-free 
zone and a durable peace to be ensured there, it is essential to 
get the U.S. forces and nuclear weapons withdrawn from South 
Korea unconditionally and totally. This is the main question 
which must be solved in removing the danger of a nuclear war on 
the Korean peninsula over which the world is now concerned, and 
guaranteeing peace. 
  We believe that the council will take a serious view of the 
criminal nuclear arms development by the South Korean 
authorities, which is being feverishly promoted behind the scene 
of the U.S. nuclear smear campaign, and lift up voices exposing 
it to the international community. 
  We also express the hope that you will continue to extend 
unstinting support to the Korean people's just cause of peace on 
the Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) 
strongly urged the U.S. President to abandon the U.S. commitment 
to providing its nuclear umbrella for South Korea and, at the 
same time, to take measures to withdraw more than 1,000 pieces 
of nuclear weapons from South Korea without delay and promptly 
check the criminal nuclear arms development of the South Korean 
authorities, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation 
reported. 
  In a protest message to the U.S. President May 17 it charged 
that the "White House" has been conniving at the nuclear arms 
development in South Korea which has been stepped up under the 
U.S. nuclear umbrella. 
  The message noted that spent nuclear fuel can be replaced 
any 
moment for the pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) in Wolsong 
and the multi-purpose research reactor at the Taedok complex in 
South Korea while they are operating, that the 678,700 kilowatt 
PHWR in Wolsong has yielded spent nuclear fuel including 
plutonium enough to make more than 370 nuclear warheads up until 
now and that the 30,000 kilowatt multi-purpose research reactor 
in Taedok is one for nuclear development which is producing 
plutonium more quickly than the PHWR. 
  While taking issue with the North over its 5 megawatt 
experimental development reactor, the United States has not 
called into question the Wolsong PHWR and Taedok multi-purpose 
research reactor which put out plutonium several ten times 
greater than that, the message said. 
  Calling attention to the fact that South Korea and Japan 
have 
maintained close relations of technical cooperation for their 
own nuclear armament under the U.S. nuclear umbrella, it 
stressed: Far from checking this dangerous conspiracy and tieup, 
the United States put up South Korea and Japan as shock brigades 
in the nuclear racket against the North, thus creating a grave 
nuclear threat not only on the Korean peninsula but in the rest 
of Asia.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The Korean Committee for 
Asian-African Solidarity sent a letter to the tri-continental 
people's solidarity organization on May 18 calling upon it to 
expose to the international community the truth behind the 
criminal nuclear development of the South Korean authorities. 
  The letter calls attention to the fact that the South Korean 
authorities have stepped up their own nuclear developmant behind 
the facade of the anti-DPRK campaign of the U.S. over its 
"nuclear issue. 
  According to it, the pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) 
in Wolsong camouflaged as a "commercial" reactor and the 
multi-purpose reactor in Taedok disguised as one for "research" 
constitute the backbone in the production of fissionable 
material in South Korea at present. 
  The Wolsong PHWR which started operation in 1983 has so far 
yielded plutonium enough to make more than 370 nuclear warheads. 
  As South Korean experts of nuclear development have already 
confessed, in introducing the PHWR from Canada the South Korean 
authorities sought to obtain high-grade plutonium from natural 
uranium by their own efforts. And they considered that with 
this heavy water reactor they could evade an international 
inspection because spent nuclear fuel could be abstracted from 
it any moment without stopping its operating. 
  It is not fortuitous that a South Korean official dealing 
with atomic energy said "like businesses keeping a double 
account-book, one can register 10 kg of nuclear fuel after 
dealing with 1,000 kg daily." 
  The multi-purpose research reactor in South Korea also is 
one 
for the development of nuclear weapons, not for the "peaceful 
development of atomic energy". It is so designed as to be 
remodelled without difficulty for the production of plutonium 
and to produce spent nuclear fuel containing high-grade 
plutonium in a shorter period than the PHWR. 
  Now, South Korea has not only the PHWR and the multi-purpose 
research reactor but even post-irradiation test facilities 
capable of abstracting plutonium by reprocessing spent nuclear 
fuel therefrom. 
  This notwithstanding, the United States and the 
International 
Atomic Enery Agency [IAEA] have connived at the PHWR in Wolsong 
and the multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea, 
used for military purposes, while taking issue with the North's 
5-megawatt experimental nuclear power station, and magnified the 
fictitious "nuclear suspicion" against the North and used it as 
an excuse for implementing their policy of stifling the DPRK. 
  This is an outrage and act of aggression which must be 
allowed on no account either in view of peace on the Korean 
peninsula or in view of international justice and impartiality. 
  The ever more undisguised nuclear racket of the United 
States 
is a product of its strategic ambition to bind not only the DPRK 
but other non-nuclear states and developing countries to the 
nuclear chain for ever and dominate them by the nuclear stick. 
  We believe that your organization will widely organize unity 
and joint action of the peoples on the three continents to 
expose to the international community the truth behind the U.S. 
imperialists' nuclear racket against the DPRK and behind the 
criminal nuclear development of the South Korean authorities 
stepped up behind the scene and contribute to the creation of an 
international environment favorable to peace and reunification 
of Korea. 
  At the same time, we call for a joint struggle to accuse the 
IAEA of its partiality in defending nuclear powers and 
encroaching upon the sovereignty of non-nuclear states and to 
establish a new nuclear control order based on international 
impartiality.

villagers of Yangsan, South Kyongsang Province, held the sixth 
rally on May 20 against the construction of a nuclear waste dump 
by the puppet authorities, according to a radio report from 
Seoul. 
  At the rally the promotion committee of the struggle against 
the construction of the Yangsan nuclear waste dump declared that 
the boycott of schools by students in Yangsan and Ulsan would be 
expanded, if the puppet authorities refused to give up the 
project. 
  The villagers demanded that the puppet authorities release 
those taken into custody while participating in the struggle 
against the project and stop police search for those on the want 
list.

chief culprits -- traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u -- the 
puppet Seoul District prosecution authorities hurriedly 
mobilized riot police for a strict cordon around the prosecution 
building and violently blocked dissidents from entering the gate. 
  This is a truculent anti-democratic act of fascist tyrants 
ruthlessly trampling down the elementary democratic rights of 
the people. 
  It is a very legitimate exercise of their right for the 
people to indict the culprits of the Kwangju massacre and demand 
their punishment. 
  Moreover, there is no ground for the present 
"civilian"-veiled "government" of South Korea, which pretends to 
have inherited the "spirit of the Kwangju resistance," to refuse 
to meet the people's demand. The violent hindrance of the 
presentation of the indictment was aimed at burying into 
obscurity the crimes of the murderers of Kwangju people and 
defend them. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique, though "civilian"-veiled, is a 
fascist group little different from the military dictatorial 
forces of the "Fifth and Sixth Republics." 
  If the clique thinks it can go scotfree, protecting the 
culprits of the Kwangju massacre, it is foolish and stupid, 
indeed. 
  The South Korean people's unanimous will is to clarify the 
truth behind the Kwangju bloodbath and judge and punish the 
murderers. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam group, turning a deaf ear to their 
demand, persists in "defending" the murderers of Kwangju, it 
will encounter greater protest and criticism from the people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- Some 1,500 students 
under the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils 
(Hanchongnyon) held a rally for succeeding the spirits of the 
May 18 popular resistance and fighting against the United States 
at Seoul City University on May 21 and urged a halt to the U.S. 
pressure for nuclear inspection of the North, according to a 
report from South Korea. 
  In a resolution they denounced the United States for 
unreasonably putting pressure on the North for its own 
interests, and strongly demanded that it withdraw the nuclear 
weapons of its forces from South Korea and stop the pressure for 
nuclear inspection of the North. 
  At the end of the rally they staged a street demonstration.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Lambastes Kim Yong-sam Group's Suppression </F>
of Hanchongnyon" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam fascist 
clique have defined the South Korean Federation of General 
Student Councils (Hanchongnyon), the patriotic vanguard of the 
South Korean students, as "an organization benefiting the enemy" 
and threw a police dragnet to arrest its chairman and the 
chairman of its national reunification committee. This is a 
premeditated fascist offensive to lacerate with the bayonet 
Hanchongnyon and students that are taking the lead in the 
movement for independence, democracy and reunification. 
  NODONG SINMUN says this in a commentary today. 
  Noting that Hanchongnyon resolved to build itself up more 
solidly and invigorate the movement for independence, democracy 
and reunification at the second-term inauguration of 
Hanchongnyon, the paper says: This deserves a praise by nation, 
not suppression. 
  The analyst continues: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group's repressive offensive against 
Hanchongnyon is part of its persistent moves to destroy 
Hanchongnyon. 
  The Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors are scheming to block 
the 
action of the pro-reunification democratic forces and ensure the 
security of their power by getting rid of Hanchongnyon, the 
vanguard of the movement for independence against the United 
States, for democracy against fascism and for national 
reunification. 
  Their repressive offensive against Hanchongnyon will add to 
their crimes. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must promptly stop the fascist 
suppression of Hanchongnyon and students and step down from 
power.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The Guyanese Committee 
for Repatriation of War Prisoners Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, was 
inaugurated in Guyana on May 14. 
  Chairman of the Guyana Committee for Support of Korea's 
Reunification Walter Bipat was elected chairman of the committee 
at the inaugural meeting. 
  The chairman in his speech said the committee would actively 
join in the worldwide movement for the repatriation of Kim and 
Ham to the northern half of Korea. 
  A statement adopted at the meeting said the refusal of the 
South Korean authorities to repatriate them is a harsh criminal 
act contrary to humanitarianism and the international law. 
  Noting that the old men Kim and Ham earnestly want to be 
repatriated to the northern half of Korea and their families, 
too, aspire after their return to the bosom of the Republic, the 
statement demanded the South Korean authorities to immediately 
send them back to the northern half of Korea. 
  Chairman of the Peru-Korea Institute of Culture and 
Friendship Angel Castro Lavarello sent a letter of protest to 
the traitor Kim Yong-sam in demand of the repatriation of the 
old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. 
  He in the letter expressed solidarity for the just demand of 
the Korean people and the progressive people of the world to 
send them back to the northern half of Korea so that they may 
meet with their families.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Some 
17 Japanese middle school students on May 13 committed a group 
assault on four third-year middle class boys of the Tokyo Korean 
Primary and Middle School No. 1 at the plaza of the department 
store in downtown Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture. 
  Due to the assault, one of the Korean schoolboys suffered an 
injury. It will reportedly take ten days for him to recover. 
  Representatives of the Chiba Prefectural headquarters and 
Tokatsu branch of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) and teachers and students of the school on May 
19 called at the Matsudo Police Station to inform it of the 
damage and demanded that it take an appropriate measure to 
prevent the recurrence of such grave case. 
  A series of cases prove that the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon 
campaign of the Japanese authorities is also directed against 
Korean students in Japan.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- Organisations of 
different countries denounced the suppression of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by the 
Japanese authorities. 
  The Central Committee of the Organisation of Workers of 
Mozambique in a statement on May 13 said the rash acts of the 
Japanese reactionaries against powerful socialist Korea and 
Chongnyon are ridiculous, indeed. Japan is stepping up its 
conversion into a military power and nuclear power behind the 
curtain of such insidious acts, the statement noted. 
  It said the Japanese reactionaries must stop the suppression 
of Chongnyon at once and apologize to the Korean people. 
  The French Committee for Recognizing the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea in a letter of protest sent to the Japanese 
ambassador to France on May 10 branded the suppression of 
Chongnyon by the Japanese authorities as an intolerable 
violation of human rights and strongly urged a prompt stop to 
the suppression. 
  On the same day, the Portugal-Korea Friendship Association 
in 
a letter of solidarity to Han Tok-su, chairman of the Central 
Standing Committee of Chongnyon, expressed full support to and 
solidarity with the Koreans in Japan in the struggle to defend 
Chongnyon. 
  The Central Executive Committee of the National Railway 
Workers' Union of Japan published a statement on May 12 and the 
Saitama Women's Society for Supporting the Independent and 
Peaceful Reunification of Korea sent letters of request to the 
prime minister, the director general of the police agency and 
the Osaka prefectural police headquarters of Japan on April 29.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- Organisations of 
different countries denounced the United States for increasing 
the tension on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Central Committee of the Organisation of Workers of 
Mozambique in a statement on May 9 said that the United States 
is trying to justify its aggressive moves under the pretext of 
the fictitious "nuclear issue" of Korea and the South Korean 
authorities are walking the road of anti-national crimes, 
following the U.S. aggressive moves. 
  If the United States ignites a war on the Korean peninsula, 
in spite of the warnings of the Korean people and the world's 
peaceloving people, it will be burnt to death in the flames 
kindled by it, stressed the statement. 
  The Guinean Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification 
in 
a statement on May 10 said that the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula cannot be resolved with pressure or threat. It urged 
an early resumption of the DPRK-U.S. talks in favour to the 
independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. 
  The Malian National Committee for the Study of the Chuche 
Idea in a statement on the same day said that the United States 
must stop at once the deployment of Patriot missiles in South 
Korea and all the war games such as the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises and respond to the negotiations for the 
establishment of a new peace arrangement on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Mali Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee in a statement on 
May 5 called on the world's progressive people and organisations 
that love justice and peace to vigorously turn out in the 
struggle to prevent the reckless nuclear war provocation of the 
United States, and Secretary General of the Ghanaian National 
Institute of the Chuche Idea Fred Agbobli in a letter to the UN 
secretary general on May 10 demanded that the United Nations 
approach the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula on the 
principle of respect of sovereignty and impartiality to live up 
to the expectation of the world's peaceloving people.

  He supported the Korean people's cause of national 
reunification. 
  Chairman of the People's Front of Workers, Peasants and

<F P=106> ["Press Conference at Hanminjon Mission in Cuba" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Havana, May 21 [dateline as received] (KCNA) -- A 
press conference was held at the mission of the South Korean 
National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in Cuba on May 18 on the 
occasion of the 14th anniversary of the Kwangju popular uprising. 
  At the press conference Deputy Chief of the Mission Kim 
Chang-su said that the Kwangju popular uprising was a heroic 
resistance in which more than one million people fought, 
controlling Kwangju city for ten days, and which developed the 
anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle to a higher stage. 
  "Through the struggle the South Korean people clearly saw 
the 
true color of U.S. imperialism and began to direct the sharp 
edge of their struggle to it," he noted, and said: "U.S. 
imperialism is the very one trying to destroy our nation with a 
nuclear war." 
  "The United States is driving the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war by continuously shipping Patriot 
and other war equipment into South Korea and staging `Rimpac' 
exercises. This is a challenge to our nation which loves peace," 
he stated. 
  He said that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is keeping the 
"National Security Law" the abolition of which is demanded even 
by the United States, is expanding the "Security Planning Board" 
and getting frantic in suppression in order to block the road of 
independence, democracy and reunification, and is defending the 
traitors Chon Tu- hwan and No Tae-u, the real criminals in the 
Kwangju massacre, thus making it plain that he is of the same 
clan with the preceding military dictators. 
  "The entire people should unite as one, rise up in the 
second 
Kwangju resistance and build an independent, democratic new 
society free from foreign forces and fascism and accelerate the 
reunification of the country on all accounts," he said.

capitalism in the former Soviet Union and East European 
countries does never mean the "end of socialism". 
  Noting that the world's revolutionary forces should be 
reorganized with heroic Korea at the centre and that it is their 
noble duty to defend Korea, the socialist bastion, he said they 
would fight to discharge their international duty under the 
Pyongyang declaration according to the idea of independence, 
equality and anti-imperialism.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il sent a centenary birthday table to Chong 
Chae-myong, an old man residing in Tokchon City, South Pyongan 
Province. 
  The birthday table was conveyed to him on May 21. 
  Born into a poor peasant family in Chongdo County, North 
Kyongsang Province, he barely eked out his livelihood during the 
feudal period and under the Japanese imperialist rule as a farm 
hand, tenant farmer and day labourer. 
  He could enjoy a worthy life and happiness only after the 
liberation of the country. During the fatherland liberation war 
he took an active part in the drive for increased wartime grain 
production and in aiding the front. In the postwar period he 
was the first to join an agricultural cooperative and worked 
hard to reap bumper crops every year. 
  Now, he has a big family of nearly 50.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- Working people here 
significantly marked the lapse of 48 years since the great 
leader President Kim Il-song participated in the ground-breaking 
ceremony of the Potong River improvement project and kindled the 
first flame of grand nature-harnessing . 
  On May 21, 1946, President Kim Il-song initiated the Potong 
River improvement project as the first undertaking for carrying 
into practice the plan of land administration he had matured in 
the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, and took 
up the first spade at the ceremony. The project was completed 
in only 55 days thanks to the wise guidance of President Kim 
Il-song and to the great zeal and will of builders and Pyongyang 
citizens to build the country. 
  With a view to conveying down through generations the 
immortal feat of President Kim Il-song, the Workers' Party and 
people of Korea set up a monument to the Potong River 
improvement project on the spot and annually celebrate May 21 as 
"day of builders". 
  A meeting of working people in the capital city took place 
in 
front of the monument on May 21.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Yoichi Takita: "Markets Test </F>
Coordinated Actions of Japan, United States, and Europe--Loss of 
Confidence in Dollar Leads to Turbulence"] 
  [Text] Domestic and international financial and foreign 
exchange markets have entered a turbulent phase in conjunction 
with the ending of low interest rates in the United States. The 
declining dollar accompanied by rising U.S. interest rates is 
forcing payment of the piper for high valuations of financial 
instruments that were previously supported by a surfeit of U.S. 
investment funds. Financial authorities in Japan, the United 
States, and Europe have bolstered their coordination of policy 
actions, are desperately attempting to mollify market 
instability, and are now engaged in the hazardous venture of 
determining whether they can restrain the disruptive actions of 
the huge money supply created by low-interest policies. 
<H5>  Focus on Rise in U.S. Interest Rates </H5>
  Bidding for 10-year U.S. notes issued by the U.S. Treasury 
on 
the 11th did not go well and securities dealers complained, "No 
one is placing orders to buy." Domestic and international 
investors disregarded the offerings even though the groundwork 
had been laid beforehand through actions such as coordinated 
market intervention by Japan, the United States, and Europe in 
the purchase of dollars and intensified coordinated actions in 
the area of interest policy. 
  Financial market sources are showing nervousness ahead of 
the 
Federal Open Market Committee meeting of 17 May, asking, "When 
is the Federal Reserve Board [FRB] going to raise the federal 
discount rate?" 
  The prevailing view is that the U.S. consumer price index 
will rise no more than 3 percent in both 1994 and 1995. Even 
Merrill Lynch economist Mr. Steinberg estimates that "the U.S. 
economy is undergoing steady noninflationary growth." 
  Nevertheless, U.S. long-term interest rates have risen 1 
percent since the beginning of the year and the rise in interest 
rates continues unabated along with tightening measures taken by 
the FRB. Chairperson Laura Tyson of the U.S. presidential 
Council of Economic Advisers seems to be saying that the markets 
are responding erroneously, as she says, "The financial markets 
are reacting excessively to inflationary ghosts." 
  Hirohiko Okumura, Nomura Research Center research director, 
takes the view that "the U.S. financial authorities themselves 
are responsible for triggering the market turbulence." The FRB's 
ultra-low-interest-rate policies of keeping real interest rates 
near zero percent for the last two years created the bubble in 
financial assets. Invest trusts recruited funds from ordinary 
households and went on a buying spree for domestic and 
international bonds and stock. 
  Taking the road to full-scale recovery for the U.S. economy 
brought an end to low interest rates. The rise in interest rates 
triggered a withdrawal from investment trusts, and in March 
caused a net withdrawal of $7.7 billion from bond investment 
trusts and a drop of one-half in the flow of funds into stock 
investment trusts to a level of $6.7 billion compared to the 
preceding month. 
<H5>  Dollar Being Sold Despite Recovery in Economy </H5>
  Financial and stock markets in Asia, Central and South 
America, and Europe dropped substantially as the flow of funds 
from the United States slowed. The international capital flow 
which had been sustained by the excess money supply in the 
United States underwent a sudden, simultaneous shut off. 
  When the tempo of the U.S. economic recovery accelerates and 
interest levels rise, it should trigger dollar-buying, but the 
markets have begun to contrarily interpret such trends as reason 
to sell the dollar. 
  It seems that the thinking affecting the markets includes 
the 
idea that "expansion of domestic demand equals a rise in imports 
equals an expansion of international balance-of-payments 
deficits equals a decline of the dollar" or "expansion of 
domestic demand equals tightening of the labor supply and demand 
ratio equals a rise in the inflation rate equals a rise in 
long-term interest rates and a drop in the value of dollar." 
According to Japanese economists who visited the United States 
recently, U.S. business attitudes which promptly look for price 
hikes whenever demand rises remain unchanged as consumers 
undergo a waiting period before delivery of new vehicles and 
hikes in selling prices become widespread. 
  The tolerance of a strong yen by U.S. monetary authorities 
as 
a way to correct imbalances between Japan and the United States 
has now boomeranged on the United States in the form of a 
decline in confidence in the dollar. Japanese institutional 
investors such as life insurance companies are hesitant about 
buying U.S. bonds. It could be said that the only money now 
being made available to compensate for the recurring U.S. 
deficit is that flowing into the United States through the 
coordinated buying of the dollar by overseas central banks. 
<H5>  Key To Restraining Inflation </H5>
  Although Japan and Europe have beefed up coordinated actions 
to stabilize the dollar from the interest rate aspect by 
assuming financial easing policies, they have failed to 
eliminate the market psychology of a cheaper dollar. 
  Japan Industrial Bank's International Financial Research 
Department's Deputy Chief of Research Yasunori Nagai comments, 
"The recent drop in the dollar is a major U.S. issue wherein 
they've been forced to pay the piper because of ultra-easing 
financial policies." The key to recovery of confidence in the 
dollar rests with U.S. policy to restrain inflation, but the 
Clinton administration has chosen CEA member Alan S. Blinder, a 
growth advocate, to replace FRB Vice Chairman David Mullins, who 
was an advocate of stable prices. 
  The markets' interpretation of the U.S. Government as 
stressing growth and neglecting restraint of inflation is 
undermining moves towards financial tightening. The U.S. 
Government has treated the low long-term interest rates as 
evidence of confidence in its economic policies, but long-term 
interest rates have risen to about 7.5 percent, the highest 
level since the current administration took office. Turbulence 
in the markets is a reflection of the fragility of the 
strategies being used to provide a soft landing for a U.S. 
economy moving towards being overheated and of the precarious 
nature of the reliance being placed on U.S. economic expansion 
to improve the global economy.

<F P=106> [By reporter Naoya Tsuchiya] </F>
  [Text] Since the beginning of the year, German long-term 
interest rates have risen sharply as if to defy the lowering of 
the official discount rate by the German Federal Bank. You might 
say that the markets have rebeled against the German Federal 
Bank, which is strongly independent and is referred to as the 
"central bank among central banks." 
<H5>  Loses "Characteristics of Federal Bank" </H5>
  Growth in the money supply is also running high at about a 
two-digit rate. The Federal Bank has been managing policy in a 
manner that showed excessive sensitivity to the seeds of 
inflation, losing its "characteristics as a Federal Bank," and 
inviting the distrust of financial markets. 
  The rise in U.S. interest rates, induced by monetary 
tightening in the United States in February, led to a hike in 
interest rates in the European markets. Although the United 
States is taking tightening measures and Germany is following an 
opposite relaxation posture, market rates have assumed a 
"coupling" phenomenon where they are rising in both regions. 
  Turbulence in U.S. financial markets can said to have spread 
to European markets like those of Germany. Ever since both yen 
and European currencies such as the Deutsche mark began to rise 
against the dollar, the U.S. Treasury has displayed a noticeable 
degree of alarm. One market source interpreted U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's public statements on two separate 
occasions as being "tantamount to declaring a dollar crisis." 
  Officials at a leading city bank commented, "Cautionary 
measures were taken out of fear that rising U.S. interest rates 
because of a weak dollar would spread to Europe," as the reason 
why European nations such as Germany joined in the Japan-U.S. 
coordinated market intervention to buy dollars on 4 May. For the 
time being, the modestly paced "coordinated actions" by the 
United States and Germany are benefiting Japan. The reason is 
that actions to support the value of the dollar against European 
currencies has temporarily halted the rising trend of the yen. 
Nevertheless, officials at the Bank of Japan [BOJ] remain 
concerned. 
  Imbalances in international payments are not an issue 
between 
the United States and Germany, but the Japan-U.S. balance of 
payments shows an annual $130 billion surplus for Japan. As 
Germany lowers its official discount rate and the United States 
hikes its official discount rate, the United States and Germany 
are able to attain their common objective of stabilizing foreign 
currency exchange rates. BOJ officials fear that "Japan will now 
be asked to discharge its obligations." 
  The root cause of the weak dollar is the shortage in the 
flow 
of funds to the United States to compensate for deficits in the 
U.S. balance of payments. In March, instead of investment funds 
flowing out of Japan which is the nation recording the highest 
surpluses against the United States, $11 billion in Japanese 
institutional investor funds flowed back into Japan. 
<H5>  Surpluses That Fail To Drop </H5>
  A senior BOJ official remarks, "We are speaking of an 
exercise in futility," in referring to the yen selling-dollar 
buying intervention amidst a growing surplus of dollars within 
the flow of funds. A BOJ policy committee member goes so far as 
to joke, "Perhaps a more effective measure would be to select a 
currency other than the dollar to use as a foreign exchange 
reserve." The reason is that the several hundred millions of 
dollars purchased since last year have dropped in value because 
of the progressive strong yen-weak dollar relationship. 
  Even if the value of the yen rises, Japanese firms have no 
choice but to seek their means of survival by exporting to 
maintain optimum plant operating levels, which contributes to 
the failure of surpluses to decline. Such "weaknesses" of the 
Japanese economy lead to pressure for a strong yen and vitiate 
intervention efforts. 
  Even Japan has resumed a policy to implement lower 
short-term 
interest rates to reinforce the coordinated intervention 
actions. One BOJ director states, "There's nothing that says it 
would be bad for short-term market rates to fall below the 
official discount rate." Normally, the official discount rate, 
currently at 1.75 percent, at which the BOJ lends to 
private-sector banks serves as the lower limit for the interest 
rate structure. This new approach varies decisively from 
previous BOJ statements that "common sense dictates that the 
official discount rate does not go above market rates," and 
indicates that the goal is to drop market rates considerably 
lower. 
  On 13 May the BOJ boosted the money supply and boosted 
efforts to establish lower short-term interest rates, and 
short-term interest rates are expected to fall further at the 
beginning of next week. Market participants predict that, 
"Interest on next-day unsecured call money might drop below 2 
percent." 
<H5>  Decline in Political Leadership </H5>
  Although the outlook for the economy "Shows signs of 
improvement," according to BOJ President Yasushi Mieno, the BOJ 
was forced to reinforce moves towards lower short-term interest 
rates for the sake of "coordination." As a minority coalition, 
the Hata government could have difficulty even passing a budget 
and it suffers from a decline in political leadership. The 
United States seems to have toned down its demands on Japan, but 
there is no guarantee that it will remain content only with the 
interest-lowering actions of the BOJ. 
  The recent coordinated actions among Japan, the United 
States, and Europe resulted in realizing the coordinated goals 
of the group, but lurking in the background is the situation 
that demands that preference be given to domestic political 
affairs. Difficulties are being faced in implementing effective 
policies such as hikes in U.S. official discount rates and 
reductions in Japanese recurring surpluses, which means that it 
would not be surprising to see a sudden disruption in the 
"coordinated actions." If that should occur, market upheavals 
may not be restricted to the rising of long-term interest rates.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Japan-U.S.-Europe Policy Coordination Is </F>
Limited to Treatment of Symptoms"] 
  [Excerpt] Japan-U.S.-Europe policy coordination in the area 
of financial matters is visible for the first time in a number 
of years. As a minimum, the actions being taken give that 
appearance. And, those actions continue beyond the initial 
coordinated interventions in foreign exchange markets that were 
initiated on 4 May. However, a look at the realities indicates 
that it would be difficult to conclude that the policy of 
multilateral coordination among principal nations has been 
restored. Mention must also be made that the policy we speak of 
now is limited to treatment of the symptoms. 
  When the German Federal Bank implemented its third interest 
rate reduction this year on 11 May, U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen said, "The move is welcome as a measure which will 
be useful in stimulating the economies of Germany and Europe as 
a whole," and displayed confidence that the cooperative posture 
of Japan, the United States, and the European nations was 
functioning effectively. 
  The question is, to what extent is this genuine policy 
coordination? And to what degree is it effective? If we were to 
start with the conclusion, mention should be made that the 
actions being taken do not represent a full-scale restoration of 
policy coordination at the G-7 level of principal nations which 
comprise the summit members. 
  As an example, Minister of Finance Hirohisa Fujii comments 
on 
policy coordination among Japan, the United States, and Germany 
by saying, "Coordination on interest rates was not mentioned at 
the G-7 meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents 
on 24 April." Even Bank of Japan [BOJ] President Yasushi Mieno 
responded to the question of whether an agreement had been 
reached at the G-7 level on interest policy other than market 
intervention to prevent a fall in the dollar, by saying, 
"Monetary policy is not of a nature that you would restrict 
actions to the foreign exchange markets or of a nature that 
management would be based solely on foreign exchange values. It 
appears that the mass media find much appeal in coordinated 
interest drops or hikes, but the monetary policies of the 
respective nations should be responsive to conditions in each 
country and are not conducive to calls for massive, uniform 
change." 
  The United States is a nation that is conspicuous in its 
reluctance to respond to external pressure. The United States 
did not take the initiative in coordinated action to prevent a 
decline in the dollar only for fear of a weak dollar. Moreover, 
the reason did not rest with the desire to prevent an 
excessively strong yen. 
  The United States took the coordinated actions out of fear 
of 
a vicious cycle reflecting an overheated U.S. economy leading to 
concerns for inflation, a decline in the dollar despite rising 
interest rates and accelerating inflation. The United States 
will not take action solely in response to the value of the 
dollar, in contrast to Japan, which is excessively sensitive to 
the value of the yen. 
  Basically, when long-term U.S. interest rates rise, the 
United States treats the matter as a domestic issue. The reason 
is that higher interest rates can lead directly to lower stock 
prices. 
  However, we cannot neglect the fact that the situation in 
the 
U.S. economy is susceptible to a rise in interest rates because 
of a drastic fall in the dollar. The primary reason for that 
susceptibility is the inadequate savings rate in the United 
States. 
  The recent favorable economic conditions in the United 
States 
are attributable largely to an expansion of consumption based on 
credit. Individual savings are at an unusually low level. 
  The U.S. economy's fundamental problem rests on this point. 
Domestic savings are not sufficient to cover needs arising from 
the fiscal deficit and demand for capital to handle capital 
investments. There is no choice but to rely on foreign capital 
inflows to cover the shortages. The U.S. Government asserts that 
the fiscal deficit has begun to shrink, but if savings rates 
fall further, the imbalances in the economy will remain 
unchanged. 
  Policies that neglect to act on such structural issues can 
represent no more than treatment of symptoms. That being the 
case, Japan had better not place excessive hope on recent 
"coordinated" actions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Yasuhiro Tase, editorial staff of Tokyo NIHON </F>
KEIZAI SHIMBUN: "Cross-Purposes Behind Political Confusion"] 
  [Text] The "friends of yesterday" instantly become the 
"enemies of today," when the political situation changes 
dramatically. 
  At 1400 on 25 April, Chairman Keigo Ouchi of the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP] was facing Masayoshi Takemura, 
representative of Sakigake [Harbinger], whom he had invited by 
phone to meet at "an inconspicuous place." 
<H5>  Ouchi Is Becoming a Different Man </H5>
  Ouchi said: "I want to cut off the Ichi-Ichi [Ichiro Ozawa, 
coleader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), and Yuichi 
Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito] line at any cost. To do 
that we must form a powerful parliamentary group that excludes 
Komeito. Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the DSP, is 
definitely leaning toward Shinseito. The only way the party can 
reunite is through cooperation with Shinseito." 
  Takemura retorted: "Have you not cooperated with us so far 
in the struggle against Shinseito? Despite this..." 
  To all appearances, the key mover behind the united group 
called "Kaishin" [Innovation] is Ouchi. However Ouchi, together 
with Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] and Takemura, had been resolutely opposed to the 
"Kaikakunokai" [Reform Group], proposed by Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa immediately following the announcement that he 
intended to resign. 
  What was behind Ouchi's change of mind? Those close to the 
DSP testify that it was a result of the struggle he had with 
Yonezawa for leadership of the party. It was said Yonezawa, who 
had a pivotal role in the "Ichi-Ichi line," was more influential 
within the party than Ouchi, who leaned toward the SDPJ and 
Sakigake. 
  Furthermore, Ouchi's strategy went very wrong because 
Sakigake decided "to cooperate from outside the cabinet." The 
DSP has a sentiment similar to hatred for the closely related 
SDPJ because both were born of the same original party. As a 
result, the DSP cannot work with the SDPJ. 
  On the evening of 22 April, Ouchi assembled Yonezawa, Kansei 
Nakano, chairman of party's policy board; Hiroshi Nakai, deputy 
secretary general; and Atsushi Kanda, DSP floor leader, and 
revealed his idea for the formation of a "united parliamentary 
group." 
  Immediately before the meeting and again the following day, 
Ouchi had talks with Ozawa. And on 23 April, former Prime 
Minister Hosokawa had a strictly confidential meeting with Ouchi. 
<H5>  Resourceful Strategy of Hosokawa </H5>
  It seems that Hosokawa was the star player behind the 
scenes, 
not the "Ichi-Ichi line." The action was taken, without doubt, 
in line with what Ozawa had in mind. He wanted to form a 
another new political party capable of defeating the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP]. He seemed to recover the resourceful 
wisdom traditionally inherited by members of the Hosokawa family 
after he decided to step down from the premiership. Those close 
to the Japan New Party [JNP] explain that the capital "H" at the 
beginning of Hosokawa's name can be formed by writing in Arabic 
numerals the figure 1's from "Ichi-Ichi" and then joining them 
in the middle. 
  If the "Kaishin" concept were Ozawa's strategy, it would be 
unlikely that neither Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata nor leaders of 
Shinseito were unaware of it. Furthermore, Komeito, with the 
exception of Ichikawa, was not told of the "Ouchi idea," from 
which it was excluded. 
  After stepping down Hosokawa was reduced to no more than 
leader of a small and shrinking political party which is 
struggling to survive. Now that Hata has become prime minister, 
it is no wonder Hosokawa thinks he should be at the head when a 
big new group was formed. 
  Men who know Hosokawa well say that he is thinking of 
reentering the political scene in much the same way as his 
maternal grandfather, former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe. 
Hosokawa once described Hata as a man without the faintest idea 
of what a state is and should be, and he is assumed to believe 
that Hata cannot remain in government for very long. 
  Just as in the old saying, "even a worm will turn," the SDPJ 
was furious. Even former SDPJ Secretary General Hirotaka 
Akamatsu, reputed to be comparatively close to Ozawa, did not 
conceal his anger when he said: "This is a matter of faith and 
I cannot associate with him any more in ordinary war." 
  At any rate, a clear impression has been left that things 
were pushed through too hastily. Former Prime Minister Noboru 
Takeshita, who now watches transitional politics from the 
opposition side, expressed his view: "After his illness, Mr. 
Ozawa's personality has changed." 
  As expected, though, the politicking that took place was 
guided by the hand of Ozawa. Judging from various events, the 
basis of Ozawa's strategy seems to be 1) to induce the LDP and 
the SDPJ each to split to bring about political realignment and 
2) to organize a large political party with future amendments to 
the Constitution in mind. 
  To achieve this scenario he first planned to "win over 
Michio 
Watanabe by promising him the post of minister of finance with 
the rank of deputy prime minister, to push through budget 
deliberations in the Diet, and to let the Hosokawa cabinet step 
down to be succeeded by a Watanabe cabinet after the budget bill 
was passed." Ozawa conveyed this idea directly to Watanabe at 
several of their meetings. 
  This scenario went wrong because Hosokawa threw his cabinet 
away. Despite this, Watanabe believed that the exit of the 
Hosokawa cabinet would accelerate the scenario -- in other words 
-- would lead to the birth of the "Watanabe cabinet." However, 
Watanabe only became confused by the turn of events, first 
announcing he was "seceding from the LDP" and then "retracting 
his intention to leave the LDP." 
<H5>  Yamaguchi's Role as Director </H5>
  It was Toshio Yamaguchi who, from the wings, directed the ad 
lib performance of the whole cast of leading and supporting 
actors. "Kaikaku" and "Kaishin" are the names of groups 
mentioned in a proposal drawn up by Yamaguchi to form a unified 
group. 
  The leading actors, however, had never considered the 
possibility of the SDPJ dropping out of the coalition 
government. They must have held the SDPJ in very low regard to 
think it would have no choice but to follow the other partners. 
People close to the SDPJ say the party finds the thought of 
being ranked "below" the DSP as unbearable. Akamatsu points out 
that the erstwhile partners failed because "they had too little 
knowledge of the SDPJ." 
  It was said that Ouchi, in the course of launching the idea 
of a unified group, succeeded in getting commitments from Ozawa 
and his colleagues that "the DSP will get two ministerial posts, 
one major and one minor." It was presumed he wanted to regain 
power by accomplishing what Yonezawa had been unable to do. 
  It was a mixture of strategy and Machiavellianism aimed at 
achieving survival. Nobody knows who to blame, the deceivers or 
the deceived. The confused political scene is becoming more 
complicated as rainbow-colored expectations are woven into the 
space between the warp of ideals and the woof of party lines.

<F P=106> [Interviews with Sadao Hirano, Shinseito (Japan Renewal </F>
Party) member close to Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, 
and Shusei Tanaka, "the No. 2 man" in Sakigake, by AERA editor 
Yoshiyuki Shuto: "Ichiro Ozawa Versus Masayoshi Takemura--Their 
Close Associates Give a True Account of the Recent Change in the 
Government"; places and dates not given] 
  [Text] The Hosokawa Administration Was Wrecked by 
Those Who Tried To Form an Alliance To Protect the Peace 
Constitution 
  [Shuto] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden 
announcement of his resignation sparked various disputes within 
the ruling coalition over the question of whom to select as his 
successor. What was the cause of this trouble? 
  [Hirano] The ostensible reasons for Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's 
sudden resignation were the improper management of his personal 
funds by one of his old friends and the Diet deadlock over the 
FY 1994 budget bills, which was brought on by scandal 
allegations against him. Prime Minister Hosokawa decided to 
step down from a sense of responsibility. However, behind the 
scenes, there was a more important problem. 
  The Hosokawa administration, which was launched as a reform 
government, achieved its goal with the enactment of the 
political reform bills. Therefore, after the passage of the 
bills, it was indispensable to strengthen the coalition's unity 
by reviewing the previous agreement reached by the coalition 
parties, and by working out a new policy platform. 
Unfortunately, Prime Minister Hosokawa failed to strengthen the 
framework of the ruling coalition, and this was the real reason 
for his resignation. 
  In my opinion, what brought about the collapse of the 
Hosokawa administration was the secret attempt by a certain 
group in the ruling coalition to form an alliance with the 
members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] who 
favor preservation of the peace Constitution. 
  [Shuto] Are you talking about Sakigake's [Harbinger] plan to 
form a grand alliance with the LDP and the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ]? 
  [Hirano] Yes. There are some indications that Sakigake has 
been pondering the plan since the middle of February. According 
to sources close to Prime Minister Hosokawa, at the Japan-U.S. 
summit meeting February, U.S. President Bill Clinton said to the 
prime minister, "When the Japanese Government has to make a 
decision about North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons 
development program, a certain key person in the ruling 
coalition might become a bottleneck." 
  [Shuto] I guess that President Clinton was alluding to 
Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura. By the way, how did 
Sakigake carry forward its plan to create a grand alliance with 
the LDP and the SDPJ? 
  [Hirano] According to sources close to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura had planned to submit 
his resignation to the prime minister on 13 April if the LDP's 
demand that the prime minister agree to summon his former aide 
to testify to the Diet about Hosokawa's personal finances had 
continued to hold up deliberations on the FY 1994 budget. I 
think that his resignation from the cabinet was part of his 
scenario to form a grand alliance with the LDP and the SDPJ. 
  Meanwhile, the heads of three parties--the SDPJ, the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and Sakigake--have stressed 
that the process to select a successor to Hosokawa should be 
handled by the heads of the parties rather than by the 
secretaries general. The call for a top meeting by the heads of 
the coalition parties in effect meant that they wanted to set up 
a completely new government. Sakigake's plan to create a grand 
alliance with the LDP and the SDPJ was lurking in the background. 
  According to the information available, those who had 
planned 
to create the grand alliance had already reached agreement on 
such issues as tax reform and a revision of the UN Peacekeeping 
Operations [PKO] Cooperation Law. I heard that they had agreed 
not to raise the consumption tax and to continue the freeze on 
participation of Self-Defense Forces personnel in UN 
peacekeeping forces [when the so-called PKO law was enacted in 
1992, it was agreed that the provision prohibiting participation 
in PKO would be reviewed after three years]. 
  [Shuto] I have one more question. I have heard that these 
people expected an early dissolution of the lower house so that 
the next general election would be held again under the old 
multiseat electoral system. Is this true? 
  [Hirano] I suppose so. They should have planned the 
following scenario: win a majority in the lower house election 
held under the old electoral system, kill the new electoral 
system in a vote, or divide the nation into single-seat 
electoral districts in their own way, if it is not possible to 
kill the system. 
  [Shuto] Sakigake has decided to support the new government 
from outside the cabinet. What do you think of this? 
  [Hirano] Sakigake has been proposing its own policy goals, 
using fine language. To me, it seems that this party is only 
making irresponsible statements. It always says nice things, 
but it never wants to bear responsibility. Such an attitude 
could be seen during the debate over the rice issue and during 
the turmoil caused by the prime minister's plan to impose a 
7-percent welfare tax. It seems to me that Sakigake is just 
trying to hold the deciding vote while advocating its policy 
goals. 
  When Sakigake set out its basic stand on major issues, it 
pledged to respect the peace Constitution. However, its respect 
for the peace Constitution is qualitatively different from the 
SDPJ's principle of safeguarding the peace Constitution. 
Therefore, even if Sakigake tries to push its policy under the 
slogan of "respect for the peace Constitution," the public will 
probably give the party a frigid stare, although most Sakigake 
lawmakers are taking it seriously. 
  [Shuto] Could you please explain the basic stand taken by 
Shinseito leaders, including Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa? 
  [Hirano] Policy goals should be consistent with political 
ideologies, and this should be the basis of a government. It is 
only right for political groups sharing similar political 
ideologies to join hands in forming a government. Shinseito has 
always assumed that an alliance was possible, not only with 
Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, but also with other LDP members having the same 
aspirations as ours. Meanwhile, the Hosokawa administration 
valued cooperation with the United States above everything else. 
Our party is trying to follow this line, but those who wanted 
to form an LDP-SDPJ alliance have different beliefs. For 
instance, they think that Japan should not take a firm attitude 
toward North Korea, which is suspected of developing nuclear 
weapons. 
  [Shuto] Parties in the ruling coalition have finally reached 
a policy agreement on which to form a new government, after a 
tense deadlock over different issues, including the question of 
how to deal with the DPRK's alleged development of nuclear 
weapons. 
  [Hirano] The North Korean nuclear issue is really important 
because it directly affects Japan's national security. If worse 
comes to worst, and if the government is unable to take 
appropriate actions to cope with the situation, then Japan will 
fall into utter confusion. As for tax reform, if the government 
does not come up with a concrete plan before this summer, Japan 
will be isolated at the annual G-7 economic summit to be held in 
Naples. It is because these issues are so important that our 
party has insisted that the coalition members work out their 
differences before forming a new government. I believe that the 
public has understood why the coalition has put in so many hours 
on working out a new policy platform. 
<H5>  Sakigake Wanted To Join Hands With LDP Members Favoring the </H5>
Peace Constitution 
  [Shuto] During the process to select a successor to Prime 
Minister Hosokawa, Sakigake once tried to check the influence of 
the Shinseito-Komeito bloc by forming an alliance with the SDPJ 
and the DSP. What was Sakigake's real intention? 
  [Tanaka] Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, SDPJ Chairman 
Tomiichi Murayawa, and DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi were of the same 
opinion that many things had to be reviewed on the way that the 
ruling coalition had been running the government. 
  The first point at issue is that some coalition members have 
made several attempts to do so in view of the next stage of the 
political realignment, under the pretext that these moves would 
support the coalition government. The Hosokawa administration, 
which was launched as a "political-reform government," gradually 
lost its uniting force after achieving its sole mission of 
political reform. Prime Minister Hosokawa tried to regain a 
uniting force by strengthening the framework under which the 
coalition government was formed. The problem was that some 
people had considered effecting the solidification of the 
framework in connection with the creation of a coalition-wide 
"new new party" in view of the next lower house election, which 
is supposed to be held under the new single-seat electoral 
system. Our party could not accept these two separate matters 
being treated in one lot. 
  Meanwhile, those who considered the Hosokawa administration 
to be a non-LDP government before everything else thought that 
the problem would be settled simply by putting a new face in the 
prime minister's office. However, our party had a different 
view. The ruling coalition had been entrusted with a special 
mission to implement political reform. Now that it has 
accomplished its original duty, putting a new face in the prime 
minister's office was not enough. That was our opinion. 
  [Shuto] Sakigake has unveiled its basic stand toward major 
issues, and it has advocated respect for the peace Constitution. 
Was this a message addressed to LDP members who are against 
revising the peace Constitution, saying that your party is 
willing to form an alliance with them? 
  [Tanaka] Former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, former 
Justice Minister Masaharu Gotoda, and some other LDP members 
have inherited the pacifist policy that the so-called 
"mainstream conservative faction" has embraced since the LDP was 
formed in 1955. Our party always had a friendly feeling toward 
these LDP members, who have the same view that we do concerning 
the peace Constitution and the evaluation of the postwar period. 
If possible, we would like to join hands with them, and we 
still wish to do so. 
  Sakigake thinks that Japan's peace Constitution should be 
preserved, at least until Japan can form a clear view of the 
situation on the Korean peninsula, a clear view regarding the 
prevention of nuclear proliferation. In this context, we can 
say that our statement was addressed to every political group 
that respects Japan's peace Constitution. 
  [Shuto] The SDPJ's principle of safeguarding the peace 
Constitution is basically the same as yours. How far has 
Sakigake's plan to form a grand alliance with the LDP and the 
SDPJ been carried forward? 
  [Tanaka] It is true that some LDP members have approached 
me on the matter, because at that time, there was a story going 
around that Mr. Watanabe would leave the LDP to join forces with 
Shinseito and Komeito. Meanwhile, our party is giving the SDPJ 
credit for being a strong supporter of the peace Constitution. 
However, to tell the truth, we were far from reaching the stage 
of forming a new government under the framework of an LDP-SDPJ 
alliance for the protection of the peace Constitution. 
  [Shuto] What was the meaning of the last political drama? 
  [Tanaka] The most important result is that antagonism 
between 
LDP and non-LDP forces has decreased. This tendency should be 
welcomed. It has become clear that the LDP is neither able to 
stand as a powerful opposition nor determined to seize back the 
reins of government by solidifying its unity. In other words, 
there is no possibility of going back to the so-called "1955 
order," the postwar political structure monopolized by the LDP. 
Metaphorically speaking, the non-LDP side has many new 
locomotives, while the LDP side has only railroad cars and 
unusable locomotives. 
  There is no doubt that Shinseito constitutes a locomotive. 
As for Sakigake, it also wants to become a locomotive. In my 
opinion, the non-LDP side has been completely transformed into a 
new political force in the true sense of the word, and it is now 
clear that the new force will be divided into two groups in the 
near future. We have already entered the next phase of 
political realignment. 
  [Shuto] Sakigake has decided to support the new government 
from outside the cabinet. Don't you think that this would mean 
the isolation of Sakigake in Nagata-cho? 
  [Tanaka] We do not want to be isolated, but at the same time 
we are not afraid of becoming isolated. We had such a sentiment 
when we decided not to accept any position in the new cabinet. 
We do not feel isolated, because we do not think that 
Nagata-cho's political map corresponds exactly to the political 
map drawn by the public. 
  On the contrary, we strongly feel that we have obtained a 
free hand, by staying under another framework of the ruling 
coalition. We can now speak with more freedom about political 
realignment and about the future of our country. Every move we 
make will no longer be perceived as being a result of a fierce 
power struggle within the ruling coalition. We have finally 
created a situation under which we can treat the question of 
political realignment and the question of maintaining a 
coalition government separately. We expect to set out our party 
platform in June. As a result, we now feel somewhat refreshed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime </F>
minister, by unidentified MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Could you please tell us about 
your abortive plan to leave the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
to seek the support of the ruling coalition in your bid to 
become prime minister? What was your biggest miscalculation in 
this affair? 
  [Watanabe] I did not make any miscalculation. I know that 
this kind of attempt has only a 50-50 chance of success. I 
wanted to participate in the new government, because I wanted to 
translate my political ideology into reality. If my opinion 
does not go down with parties in the ruling coalition, there is 
no point in participating in the new government. Some people 
criticized me by saying that I wanted to become a cabinet member 
again to finish my political career on a high note. They are 
wrong, because I have already been appointed minister seven 
times. To me, becoming a cabinet member is not uncommon. So 
even if the coalition had offered me the post of deputy prime 
minister in the new cabinet, saying, "We cannot have you as our 
prime minister, but we can offer you the post of deputy prime 
minister," I would have rejected the proposal. And besides, to 
speak the truth, the coalition never made such an offer. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] We understand that Rengo [Japan Trade 
Union Confederation] was unwilling to endorse your bid for 
premiership. 
  [Watanabe] Yes, I suppose it was. To be more precise, it 
was the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] that did not 
support me. I never wanted to become the head of a minority 
government. This is why I did not push my bid for the 
premiership this time. In any case, Tsutomu (Hata) seemed to be 
interested in taking over, so there was no reason why the 
coalition parties should choose an outsider like me as their 
prime ministerial candidate. I was able to form a clear view of 
the situation and make up my mind very early on because I had 
floated several trial balloons. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Nevertheless, the SDPJ opted out of the 
ruling coalition, forcing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to form a 
minority government. What do you think of the new cabinet 
lineup? 
  [Watanabe] This should be the best cabinet Prime Minister 
Hata is able to assemble, because the ruling coalition does not 
have many people capable of assuming government posts. The new 
cabinet is controlled by the Shinseito-Komeito bloc. If the 
Hata administration wants to pursue policy goals similar to 
those pursued by the LDP, it has to proceed humbly. If not, it 
will be short-lived. There is a limit to the tolerance that 
will be shown the high-handed tactics of Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, whose principal 
objective is to wreck the LDP. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think Mr. Ozawa is now placed in a 
difficult situation? 
  [Watanabe] As I did not see him in person, I do not know 
exactly what is happening. But I think he should be reflecting 
on his conduct, because it is now clear that, like Nobunaga Oda 
[feudal lord known for his high-handed attitude toward 
administrative matters], his approach no longer works every time. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What should Mr. Ozawa do in order to get 
out of his current difficulties? 
  [Watanabe] Shinseito was formed defectors from the LDP. It 
bears a different party name, but it is identical to the LDP in 
substance. Shinseito professes to be an advocate of political 
reform. However, all the Shinseito leaders were once at the 
center of LDP power as members of the faction controlled by Shin 
Kanemaru. Although they are not in a position to criticize the 
LDP, they are saying that the LDP is absolutely wrong. So, the 
LDP and Shinseito are hostile to each other. Relations would be 
a lot better if Shinseito leaders thought much more about the 
nation rather than being full of themselves: 80 percent of their 
work should be directed toward the conduct of state affairs, and 
less than 20 percent in looking after the interests of their 
party or in contriving strategy. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What are the chances of such an 
improvement? 
  [Watanabe] I am not sure, but Shinseito should at least try, 
because the LDP has decided to take a case-by-case approach to 
the government's policies. For instance, the ruling coalition 
can now work out a bill to expand the role of the Self-Defense 
Forces and submit it as a government-sponsored bill, because the 
SDPJ, which is opposed to this kind of legislation, bolted from 
the Hata administration. The LDP would probably not oppose such 
a bill in the Diet. At least, it is certain that I will support 
it. I cannot oppose something that I agree with. I think many 
LDP members share my view on security issues. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think many LDP members also share 
your view on tax reform? 
  [Watanabe] Well, it is not easy to find an LDP member who 
has the same view as me regarding tax reform. However, there 
will be some. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is the LDP going to judge each of the new 
government's policies by comparing it with its own policy 
platform? 
  [Watanabe] Yes, because this is exactly what party politics 
should be, and because it is not logical for the LDP to 
emotionally reject what it used to advocate while in power. The 
only problem will arise if there is conflict within the LDP 
between "genuine members" and "unauthentic members." 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The opposition parties possess the 
numbers to pass a motion of no-confidence in the prime minister, 
because he heads a minority government. Will the prime minister 
dissolve the lower house for an election, or will he ask his 
cabinet to resign? 
  [Watanabe] The odds are 50-50. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the next general 
election will take place under the old electoral system of 
multiseat constituencies? 
  [Watanabe] That is the problem. The Diet has already passed 
a package of political reform bills that call for the 
implementation of a single-seat electoral system. The question 
is whether a bill to divide the nation into single-seat voting 
districts will clear the Diet smoothly. I do not think such a 
bill will be enacted during the current Diet session. It is not 
possible. And if the next general election is held under the 
old electoral system, whether the political reform legislation 
would be reversed is another question. The SDPJ would probably 
strengthen its power by winning about 100 seats. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think it inevitable that the next 
general election will be held under the old electoral system? 
  [Watanabe] There is no other possibility if the prime 
minister is forced to dissolve the lower house at an early stage. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of him getting 
the cabinet to resign en masse? 
  [Watanabe] Well, I don't know, but if the Hata 
administration were to collapse, the reins of government would 
be restored to the LDP. I do not think the reins of government 
can be handed over from one coalition member to another 
coalition member by prearrangement three times in a row. If the 
Hata cabinet were to resign en masse, a regular procedure of 
constitutional government would be the restoration of the LDP 
rule. It would be quite normal to hand over the reins of 
government to the largest political party in terms of number of 
Diet members, namely the LDP. However, although the LDP is the 
largest party in the Diet, it only has 200-odd seats in the 
lower house. It will, therefore, have to join hands with other 
parties to form a new coalition government. The search for a 
coalition partner will certainly cause big trouble. If the LDP 
were to join forces with the SDPJ to form a coalition 
government, once again the new cabinet would not be able to 
govern effectively, because of the difference in policies. In 
any case, the LDP would lose its influence, because the casting 
vote would always be held by the SDPJ. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Does this mean that either the SDPJ or 
the ruling coalition should split? 
  [Watanabe] Which side should break up, the LDP side or the 
non-LDP side? That is the question. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How do you assess Tsutomu Hata as prime 
minister? 
  [Watanabe] Mr. Hata has a fine personality, and he seems to 
prefer politics of consensus. However, he will certainly find 
himself in a very difficult position, because there are so many 
pressing problems confronting Japan, and because circumstances 
will not allow him to maintain a noncommittal attitude toward 
these issues. I wonder how far a gentle person such as he will 
be able to paper over the difficulties.

<F P=106> [Interview with Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo (Japanese </F>
Trade Union Confederation), by unidentified MAINICHI SHIMBUN 
reporter, from the "Listening Without Reservation" column; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How do you rate the Hata 
government? 
  [Yamagishi] The Hata government is a government led by 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito. Mr. Koji Kakizawa, 
who once attacked the reformist policies of the coalition 
government in the Diet interpellation session, has become 
foreign minister. A majority of the Hata cabinet members are 
former Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] cabinet members. The Hata 
government is a carbon copy of the LDP government. The Hata 
government is positively responding to legislation at a time of 
emergency and constitutional debate which is aimed at paving the 
way for Japan to exercise its right to collective defense. The 
Hata cabinet is different from the Hosokawa cabinet and most of 
the Hata cabinet members are hard-liners. The Hata cabinet will 
not push for reform. Changes occurred because political 
intentions to change worked when the Hosokawa cabinet was in 
place. With the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and 
Sakigake [Harbinger] out of the coalition, however, the Hata 
government has largely lost its internal-check mechanism. The 
issue of foreign policy and defense is the tip of an iceberg. 
What concerns me is that such a trend may appear in domestic 
policy. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How will Rengo deal with the situation? 
  [Yamagishi] Rengo maintained a cooperative relationship with 
the Hosokawa government. This time, however, Rengo has no 
choice but to wrangle with the Hata government over policy. I 
feel as if my relatives have become other people. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Mr. Shigeto Nagano resigned as justice 
minister for making remarks that the Nanjing massacre was a 
"fabrication." What is your opinion? 
  [Yamagishi] I felt as if I was listening to broadcasts aired 
by the Japanese military during the war. Mr. Nagano is a 
convicted criminal [kakushinhan]. What is at issue is why Prime 
Minister Hata appointed Mr. Nagano as justice minister knowing 
what he does about him. If the prime minister himself decided 
to appoint Nagano as justice minister, he should be held 
politically responsible and questions should be raised about his 
choice. If the prime minister appointed him as justice minister 
after being pressed by others, that is a problem. I cannot help 
but say that Mr. Nagano was appointed as justice minister in 
line with a certain political strategy. The basic posture of 
the Hata cabinet is being questioned and Prime Minister Hata's 
appointment of Mr. Nagano as justice minister is not an issue 
that can be resolved simply by revoking the controversial 
remarks and Nagano's resignation. In principle, the Hata 
cabinet deserves to suffer defeat in a no-confidence vote in the 
Diet. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The talk is that a general election 
should be held after dissolving the House of Representatives. 
  [Yamagishi] The Hata cabinet should seek the public 
confidence at the earliest date. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Will the general elections be held under 
the current multiseat constituency system? 
  [Yamagishi] The most desirable way is to hold the general 
election under the new electoral system. If no decision is made 
on the demarcation of small constituencies, it will create a 
political vacuum that may continue for six months or a year. 
This should not be allowed to occur. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] A major political task is reform of the 
current tax system. Is there any possibility that the issue of 
reforming the current tax system will lead to the dissolution of 
the House of Representatives? 
  [Yamagishi] Effort should be made to draw a fruitful 
conclusion to reform of the current tax system by June, when the 
current Diet session ends. The SDPJ should not shun the issue 
of reforming the tax system on the grounds that it has now 
become an opposition party; that would be irresponsible. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What, then, will happen next? 
  [Yamagishi] North Korea's suspected development of nuclear 
weapons will likely generate heated debate on the issue of 
Japan's security. The security issue could provide the excuse 
for a no-confidence vote in the Diet against the Hata cabinet. 
It is highly possible that the issue could then trigger the 
dissolution of the House of Representatives. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What would be the main points of 
contention in the ensuing general election? 
  [Yamagishi] I think the tactics of power politics would be a 
major issue. Other points of contention would be the choice 
between open politics and back-door politics. The choice 
between politics for the people and politics for party interests 
will be taken up as a major campaign issue at the next general 
election. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are you going to deal with the 
chilled relationship between the SDPJ and the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP]? 
  [Yamagishi] I cannot agree with the suggestion that Rengo 
should distance itself from the chilled relationship. If Rengo 
fails to handle the sour relationship properly, it would lead to 
another split in Rengo. Rengo will play a role helping to patch 
up their differences, while at the same time presenting the two 
parties with its own policies. With the SDPJ at odds with the 
DSP, how can we form a new liberal political party? 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Would you explain the plan to form a new 
liberal political party? 
  [Yamagishi] The SDPJ has proposed forming a new liberal 
political party from liberals from the SDPJ and the DSP, but I 
do not agree with the plan. There is a misunderstanding that 
the new liberal political party will be formed by liberals 
mainly from the SDPJ and the DSP. I, however, intend to rally 
all liberal forces. Specifically, I intend to rally reformers 
from the SDPJ, the DSP, Sakigake, the Japan New Party and the 
Mirai [Future] Party, the LDP, and other reformers keen to break 
away from the LDP. The LDP does not know the meaning of reform. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of Rengo 
forging an alliance with the LDP? 
  [Yamagishi] There is no such possibility. The LDP is a mix 
of jade and stone. The jade is better than the stone. Rengo 
advocated the need to tear down the 1955 system and form a 
non-LDP government. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What are the major issues and where do 
the liberal forces stand on them? 
  [Yamagishi] They are the Constitution and Japan's 
international contributions. Liberal forces attach the maximum 
importance to the current peace Constitution. Defending the 
Constitution has both a negative and positive aspect. Japan 
should make non-military international contributions. Japan 
should make such international contributions in the non-military 
and civilian fields through a reformed United Nations. Japan 
should not play the role of the Self-Defense Forces on the world 
stage. Japan should, rather, play the roles of the Ministry of 
Health and Welfare, the Environment Agency, and the Ministry of 
Labor. I hope that the Hata government will pay attention to 
workers when it handles domestic policy. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] When do you think the general election 
will be held? 
  [Yamagishi] In July at the earliest. It would then be held 
shortly after the Naples summit, which is scheduled for early 
July. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Some trade unions appear to have started 
preparing for the general election already. 
  [Yamagishi] They have probably started preparing for the 
general election. Many trade unions are aware that they must 
prepare for a general election which is not too far away.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sakigake (Harbinger) representative </F>
Masayoshi Takemura by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You and Tomiichi Murayama, 
chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], agreed 
to cooperate with each other. Do you think it is possible for 
you to take unified actions with the SDPJ? 
  [Takemura] I am not that optimistic. I do not think we will 
immediately form a unified faction or start official policy 
meetings. However, since we are in a similar position, we felt 
that we are close to each other and that we need to cooperate. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You are clearly standing against 
Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa. 
  [Takemura] I am not willing to take a stand against Ozawa. 
I simply could not agree with his way of thinking. I am sure 
he will change more and more. Therefore, I will not assume a 
presumptuous stand by saying that I am anti-Ozawa. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Sakigake is viewed as a "liberal" 
force that confronts the "new liberals," including Ozawa. 
  [Takemura] Ozawa explained that his liberalism is "new 
liberalism that gives consideration to the weak." If he really 
means it, then I affirmatively accept it. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the disputes 
being created over the political world's reorganization? 
  [Takemura] Constitutional, diplomatic, and security issues 
are foundations. We need to coordinate while listening to each 
party's opinions. Political technique is another important 
essence that needs to be considered. As I look back at the 
experiences I had during the Hosokawa administration, I think we 
should not form a coalition unless we are willing to accept 
mutual differences. It is necessary for us to attach importance 
to cooperation with parties we think we can reach fundamental 
agreements in such areas as forming decision-making rules. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the Hata 
administration? 
  [Takemura] In his policy speech, the prime minister said 
that "the ideology of the Constitution became ever more 
important." Immediately after his inauguration, however, he 
referred to the right of collective self-defense. I think the 
series of remarks made by the chief cabinet secretary, the 
foreign minister, and the Defense Agency director general 
reflect the true nature of the current administration. I have a 
strong feeling of physical disorder. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The people's attention is focused on 
the timing of the lower house's dissolution, and whether a 
general election will be held under a system of multiseat 
constituencies or a mixture of single-seat constituencies and a 
proportional representation system. 
  [Takemura] I am trying not to think about Diet dissolution. 
I think it is reasonable to have the next election under the 
system that is a mixture of single-seat constituencies and 
proportional representation. However, I do not mean to deny the 
prime minister's constitutional right to dissolve the Diet. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] When do you think the bill for 
redrawing [House of Representatives] electoral districts will be 
approved? 
  [Takemura] We need a certain number of days for 
deliberation. It is possible that it may not be passed smoothly 
if the government or parties get involved. I think we should 
quietly deal with the issue as if we were waiting for a Supreme 
Court decision. We have to avoid creating confusion by hinting 
at the possibility of Diet dissolution. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to fight the next 
general election? 
  [Takemura] On the basis of the assumption that the next 
election will be held under the system that is a mixture of 
single-seat constituencies and a proportional representation 
system, we would like to seek wide-ranging cooperation with 
parties and political forces. We want to give backing to as 
many fine candidates as possible. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you think Japan should deal 
with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms 
development? 
  [Takemura] The United States and the ROK are having 
discussions [with the DPRK] more patiently than Japan thinks. 
For some reason, however, debates are being held in Japan on 
the assumption of launching an economic or naval blockade. I 
have an impression that Japan is too hasty. It is very 
dangerous. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to reform the tax 
system? 
  [Takemura] I am of the opinion that apart from the ruling 
parties' discussions, we need to have discussions only within 
Sakigake or with the SDPJ and some members of the Japan New 
Party. We need to reduce taxes. I think all parties are 
beginning to understand that a tax hike is inevitable too 
[sentence as published].

<F P=106> [Interview with Japan Communist Party (JCP) Chairman Tetsuzo </F>
Fuwa by unidentified MAINICHI SHIMBUN correspondent; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] seceded from the coalition government. What do 
you think of this? 
  [Fuwa] It did not split from the framework of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] politics. Last year, it was sucked into 
the Hosokawa Cabinet, which took over LDP politics. Thereby, 
the SDPJ introduced the single-seat constituency system and 
liberated the rice market. The SDPJ never did soul-searching 
for the things it did during the Hosokawa administration. 
Moreover, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama signed the Hata 
administration's policy agreement. Some of its members are 
getting angry about the party's approach toward the LDP. 
However, the SDPJ became an LDP-like opposition party. Birds 
of a feather flock together. That is all. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What to you think of the Hata 
administration? 
  [Fuwa] The administration, which became an overwhelming 
minority in both houses, has no right to do something new. It 
is common sense under the democratic system that it should 
immediately hold a general election by dissolving the House of 
Representatives. 
  Moreover, it became a minority as a result of its own 
mistakes. The Hata administration forcefully tried to increase 
the consumption tax and to enact a law to deal with an emergency 
on the Korean peninsula. Moreover, it formed a new 
parliamentary group to realize its intentions but contradictions 
burst out. We will have some troubles unless we destroy their 
dangerous intentions by holding a general election after 
dissolving the House of Representatives. We will not allow them 
to deal with the important issues without the people's consent. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the political style 
of the "Ichi-Ichi line" between Shinseito Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa? 
  [Fuwa] It is impossible under the democratic system to have 
a puppet government. Nobody has had such a political style 
since the time of former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka. In this 
sense, the Hata administration is worse than the Tanaka 
administration because Hata himself knows that he is being 
controlled. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano 
resigned. 
  [Fuwa] He made remarks that are exactly the same as the 
claims of the wartime government and military. Hata's 
responsibilities for assigning such a person to the ministerial 
post will not go away even after his resignation. The prime 
minister himself should explain his views of the war. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are you going to deal with the tax 
and Korean peninsula issues, including North Korea's suspected 
nuclear arms development? 
  [Fuwa] Since we are in a depression, we need to improve the 
people's purchasing power. It is outrageous to talk about 
increasing the consumption tax rate. They are talking about 
finding a source of revenue to cover a shortfall from the tax 
reduction. But, they increased the public utilities charges 
before we could feel the effect of the tax reduction. Now they 
are talking tax increase. It is not reasonable. They have to 
give up the idea that "the consumption tax rate needs to be 
increased because there is no other revenue source." 
  You mentioned the Korean peninsula issue. First of all, our 
stand is to say that we need to wipe out all nuclear weapons in 
this world. The Korean peninsula situation is always linked to 
the issue of enacting laws to deal with emergencies. This is an 
excuse to send the Self-Defense Forces abroad. It is very 
dangerous to go along with U.S. sanctions against North Korea. 
We are against it. 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How about the prospect of dissolving the 
House of Representative and holding a general election? 
  [Fuwa] It is difficult to predict because each party's 
intentions are involved. However, I think we should do it 
immediately. The public supports it, too. Some people are 
saying that "we should redraw the single-seat electoral 
districts in a hurry because we managed to change the election 
system after all the troubles we went through." I think that 
they are trying to do something unreasonable again. They should 
not do that. It is reasonable to have an election under the 
current system (medium-sized electoral district system) 
  [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The Japan Communist Party [JCP] changed 
its stand and is now saying that a general election should be 
held under the medium-sized electoral district system. Isn't 
that correct? 
  [Fuwa] It is. The JCP is the party that was most opposed to 
introducing a single-seat electoral district system. We are the 
first to prepare ourselves for an introduction of the system. 
However, the coalition became a minority government and 
demolished this line by itself. They should aim at holding an 
election under the medium-sized electoral district system if 
they want to find out the people's intentions by dissolving the 
House of Representatives. It is a matter of course. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal </F>
Democratic Party, by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Diet deliberations on the budget 
for fiscal 1994 have been delayed significantly. How are you 
going to deal with this? 
  [Kono] It is important for us to promote budget 
deliberations. In the past, an administration was always to 
blame for a delay in budget deliberations. This time, however, 
I want the government and the ruling parties to show a sincere 
attitude to the promotion of deliberations. I want to push 
deliberations as much as possible during the 38-day period from 
the start of the Budget Committee session on 23 May until the 
end of Diet session. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Will your party submit a no-confidence 
motion against the cabinet? 
  [Kono] I think we will because this administration does not 
represent the people's will at all and it holds only 40 percent 
of the total seats in the House of Representatives. But, since 
there are several opposition parties, I don't know whether it 
would be good for us to act alone, though there is no doubt that 
we will submit the no-confidence motion. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] When would be the right time to submit the 
motion? 
  [Kono] It is necessary to pass the budget because it is 
related to people's livelihood. Therefore, we must promote 
budget deliberations. But whether or not we will submit the 
motion right after the budget is approved is a different issue 
altogether. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] would win a general election if it was held now? 
  [Kono] I think we would definitely win. We are always ready 
to contest an election. But we want to hold it under the 
single-seat electoral district system, if possible. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Which electoral system--the single-seat or 
the multiseat system--would give the LDP an advantage over other 
parties? 
  [Kono] The single-seat electoral system would give us the 
greatest advantage. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] It is expected that if your party submits a 
no-confidence motion after the bill for redistricting electoral 
constituencies has been submitted to the Diet, the ruling 
parties as well as some LDP members will criticize the party, 
saying it is attempting to "kill political reform." 
  [Kono] The LDP has never said we would force the government 
to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a general 
election. We only said we cannot trust this cabinet. The 
redistricting bill can be submitted even after the cabinet has 
changed. I rather think some people will start asking if we 
should allow a minority ruling cabinet to redraw the electoral 
districts. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the LDP's relationship 
with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]? 
  [Kono] Although the LDP is the No. 1 opposition party, we do 
not have a majority. It is natural that the LDP will cooperate 
with several parties if we want to have decisive power. Since 
the LDP and the SDPJ are the major opposition parties, we want 
to cooperate with SDPJ, whenever possible, on Diet matters that 
could result in the overthrow of the current administration. 
But this is possible only if both parties share the same 
perception of the current political situation. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] But there is a large gap between the 
policies of the two parties. Will it become an obstacle to 
cooperation? 
  [Kono] It could become an obstacle. We need further 
discussions within the party as to whether we should start 
policy consultations with the SDPJ immediately. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] How about the LDP's relationship with 
Shinto Sakigake [Harbinger Party]? 
  [Kono] I think that psychologically, the SDPJ and Sakigake 
have something in common. But as far as policies are concerned, 
there are more similarities between Sakigake and the LDP. Since 
Sakigake is saying it will "not join the cabinet but support the 
coalition until the budget is approved," we may not share with 
Sakigake as many views as we do with the SDPJ in dealing with 
Diet matters during budget deliberations. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Do you think Sakigake could be a partner in 
coordinating policies? 
  [Kono] I think so. 
  [ASAHI SHIMBUN] Since you have been giving priority to the 
issue of avoiding another split within the party, there is a 
criticism both inside and outside the LDP that you have failed 
to drastically reform the party. 
  [Kono] I think there is a big difference between the current 
LDP and the old LDP, which had Mr. Ichiro Ozawa (Shinseito 
secretary general) and other people as its members. Mr. Ozawa 
used to shut himself up in the office of secretary general with 
people who are now Shinseito members. My LDP is entirely 
different. Mr. Michio Watanabe once said we needed a "reform 
tantamount to forming the party." I think he is right. But I 
also think we have done a good job in revising the seniority 
system, in which certain favors were given to party members 
depending on how many terms they served in the Diet and which 
factions they belonged to. Though I would not say the revision 
was done perfectly.

  [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]--whose members have 
begun to criticize party Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa because 
of the Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] secession from 
the coalition after formation of the lower house parliamentary 
group, Kaishin [Innovation]--held a standing executive council 
meeting on 10 May. At the meeting, the council tried several 
times, including a decision to reshuffle its members, to 
tranquilize the criticism. The meeting, which was held in the 
morning of 10 May, decided to assign former Home Affairs 
Minister Akira Fukida and lower house Dietman Ichiji Ishii as 
standing executive council members to replace Moriyoshi Sato, 
director general of the Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agency, 
and Shigeto Nagano, former justice minister, who resigned from 
the justice minister's post over his remarks that the "Nanjing 
massacre was a made-up story." 
  Both Fukida and Ishii joined Shinseito after it was formed. 
It is pointed out that some Shinseito members were "becoming 
`anti-Ozawa'" because, in addition to the fact that the 
coalition became a minority government as a result of the SDPJ's 
secession, they were not informed of a plan to form Kaishin. 
Some of the party members are even worried that the situation 
"may develop into a repeat of the situation Keiseikai (the 
Takeshita faction) of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] was in 
when it split" into two groups after a fierce strife within the 
faction. 
  The decision to assign Fukida and Ishii as standing 
executive 
council members was also designed to pacify the dissatisfied 
party members" (according to a close associate of Ozawa), and, 
at the same time, to "make the party's decisionmaking process 
more open" (according to a senior Shinseito official). 
  Moreover, other party members who seceded from the LDP to 
form Shinseito, were also complaining about Ozawa. At the 
party's 27 April general meeting the SDPJ immediately split from 
the coalition, the party's backbone figure and young members 
roundly criticized Ozawa, saying that "it is important for us to 
say whatever we want to say and be understood and the secretary 
general is not an exception" (according to Norio Sugiyama, 
former director of the lower house Budget Committee). On 6 May, 
Koichiro Aino, former Economic Planning Agency director general, 
said: "It [decision to form Kaishin] was a very careless 
blunder unbecoming of Ozawa. The party needs to establish an 
official decisionmaking organ." 
  At the executive council meeting, Ozawa said: "We are in 
this situation because of the (the SDPJ's) unexpected secession 
from the coalition. It is a time for us, who play central roles 
in the government, to strengthen our unity." However, it seems 
that this remark is aimed at tightening the unity [taga] that 
loosened following the confusion over Kaishin's formation. 
  On 9 May, Aino met with Ozawa and apologized for the 
criticism aimed at the executive department, saying: "I am 
afraid we put you in a lot of trouble." It seems that the 
situation within the party has calmed down for the time being. 
At the 10 May news conference, Ozawa said that "no blunders 
were made in the past." Nevertheless, some party members are 
saying that "we now can say whatever we want to say, thanks to 
Ozawa's careless mistake" (according to a senior party official).

  [Text] On 18 May, 25 listed securities firms announced 
their earnings reports for the year ending in March 1994. Total 
recurring results for all 25 firms came in at a profit of 46.6 
billion yen versus a loss of 352.3 billion yen for the year 
ending in March 1993. A recurring profit was recorded for the 
first time in three years for the group as a whole, and the 
number of firms recording profits increased from three to 13. A 
recovery in stock prices has led to an increase in brokerage fee 
revenues, indicating that overall revenues are recovering. Daiwa 
Securities experienced profits from securities trading 
activities and growth in investment trust sales fees and 
realized recurring profits of 52 billion yen, slightly exceeding 
Nomura Securities and ranking as the top performer for the first 
time. 
  Operating revenues, which represent sales in most 
businesses, 
gained 22 percent for the 25 firms as a group and totaled 1.8928 
trillion yen. The daily average volume of stocks traded on the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange increased nearly 60 percent to a figure 
just below 400 billion yen, leading to an increase in commission 
revenues. Other factors contributing to improvement in earnings 
included favorable sales of government and industrial bond 
investment trusts, expansion of profits from bond trading 
activity and the effects of cost savings resulting from 
management improvement actions. 
  Investment trust sales commissions at the four major 
securities firms reached 20 billion yen, while Daiwa, Nomura, 
and Nikko registered bond trading profits exceeding 30 billion 
yen. On the other hand, quasi-major and medium securities firms 
experienced a slowing in the profits recovery trend near the end 
of the fiscal year because of slow stock trading activity. 
  Among the 21 quasi-major and smaller firms, nine firms 
recorded profits, and New Japan Securities, Wako Securities, 
Okasan Securities, and Marusan Securities resumed payment of 
dividends. On the other hand, 12 firms continued to record 
deficits and cancel dividends. Dai-Ichi Securities and Yamatane 
Securities recorded deficits for four straight years. 
  All firms anticipate stock prices to remain firm in the 
fiscal year ending in March 1995 and expect recurring profits 
for the year. However, stock trading volume has been slow from 
the beginning of the year and the majority of quasi-major and 
smaller firms suffered losses according to the monthly earnings 
report for April. Now that cost savings from management 
improvement actions are nearing their limit and fierce 
competition lies ahead with the arrival of city bank securities 
subsidiaries, earnings prospects will remain dismal.

  [Text] Quasi-major securities firms undergoing 
restructuring have beefed up their management teams by 
appointing personnel who formerly worked for their main banks 
and the Ministry of Finance [MOF]. 
  Kankaku Securities, which recorded huge losses from 
transactions representing financial manipulations to conceal 
unrealized losses, was extended financial aid totaling 70 
billion yen in the form of a subordinate loan from Dai-Ichi 
Kangyo Bank and requested a loan for roughly 40 billion yen from 
three leading banks to establish a collateral deposit on a 
domestic convertible bond. In the area of human resources, it 
appointed Mr. Mitsuo Hamamoto as vice president, and a group of 
four other officials of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank as officers of the 
securities firm. One former employee of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank 
will resign from Kankaku Securities as a managing director, but 
that will still leave Kankaku Securities with President Yoichiro 
Kato and four others, providing for strong bank influence over 
the securities firm. 
  Yamatane Securities, which has been aided by managerial 
support from Sakura Bank, will appoint as chairman Takashi 
Yasuhara, an ex-MOF official and former vice president of the 
Agricultural-Forestry Industry Loan Corporation. He will 
collaborate with President Hidefumi Kubo, formerly of the MOF 
and Sakura Bank, in an effort to restore profits during this 
fiscal year after five years of deficits. 
  At Okasan Securities, Kozo Tsukakoshi, Bank of Japan Kobe 
branch president, will become managing director; and Koichi 
Saku, main bank Japan Industrial Bank Machida branch president, 
will become a director. Although Okasan Securities is known for 
its independent management team composed of members of the 
founding family, President Seiichi Kato says, "I would like to 
see the newcomers make use of their experience and personal 
connections at the banks they come from and shore up weaknesses 
in the management of Okasan." There are signs that he has a 
desire to overcome difficulties by bringing in new blood from 
other industries in the face of increasing competition expected 
as a result of the establishment of banks' securities 
subsidiaries. 
  Needless to say, appointment of officers from banks will not 
lead to an easy improvement in operating results. A prevalent 
comment is reflected in that of Cosmos Securities which says, 
"We have received introductions from our main banks, but it is 
difficult to translate such contacts into actual brokerage 
business." 
  The respective securities firms are exerting efforts in the 
area of cost reductions, such as in the case of Cosmos 
Securities which in April reduced its mandatory retirement age 
for managerial positions from 57 to 55. It seems that the 
appropriate management philosophy is reflected in Yamatane 
Securities President Kubo's remarks, "It is of foremost 
importance that securities firms try to make a recovery based on 
their own initiative."

<F P=106> [Article in two installments by Yoshiaki Kato, NIHON KEIZAI </F>
SHIMBUN Tokyo Bureau reporter: "Financial Condition of Local 
Governments Deteriorating; Outstanding Balance of Loans Exceed 
100 Trillion Yen"] 
<H5>  [12 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] While the national budget is yet to be 
deliberated on due to political confusion, financial conditions 
at the local level are rapidly deteriorating. As reported in the 
national government's local financial plans, the outstanding 
balance of loans of all local governments will exceed 100 
trillion yen in the fiscal year 1994 for the first time in 
history. With a drastic reduction in tax revenues, more local 
municipal bonds are steadily being issued to respond to requests 
from the national government for more locally financed projects. 
Although the economic outlook has somewhat improved, a rapid 
economic growth cannot be expected in the future. Local 
governments with large debts began to feel the sense of fiscal 
crisis. Restructuring of operations, including a review of 
personnel requirements, is likely to intensify. 
<H5>  Debts Equaling 40 Percent of National Debts </H5>
  A forecast of financial conditions compiled in mid-March by 
the Tokyo Bureau of Finance was truly a "nightmarish scenario": 
"Eight years from now in 2002, the financial condition of Tokyo 
will fall down to that of associations with restrictions imposed 
on their issuance of bonds." According to this estimate, ratio 
of the cost of municipal bonds over the total amount of general 
revenues will become double-digit in the fiscal year 1995, 
moving up to 10.8 percent from 7.7 percent for the original 
estimate for the fiscal year 1994. It is estimated to increase 
gradually, reaching 20.6 percent in the fiscal year 2002. 
  Metropolitan Tokyo, which was once regarded as an affluent 
self-governing community, is suffering from dwindling tax 
revenues. According to its original budget, tax revenues for the 
fiscal year 1994 will decrease by 7.7 percent from the previous 
year. At their peak in the fiscal year 1989, funds for fiscal 
adjustments and for redemption of bonds amounted to 450 billion 
yen, but these are expected to be depleted entirely. 
  An executive at the Finance Bureau of Tokyo says, "To make 
cautious estimates, we assumed a lower level of tax revenues and 
a higher amount of bonds issuance." However, he looks worried, 
saying, "During the Minobe administration when the fiscal 
condition deteriorated most, ratio moved up more than the 10 
percent range." As the estimate indicated that "ratio of 
municipal bonds issuance in 2002 would exceed 20 percent target 
range set by the Ministry of Home Affairs for imposition of 
restrictions on issuance of bonds," its announcement was 
postponed. 
  Those having difficulty in collecting tax revenues are not 
limited to local governments in large cities that were directly 
hit by the recession following the bubble economy. According to 
budget for the fiscal year 1994 of each of four prefectures -- 
Akita, Shimane, Kochi, and Oita -- the cash flow from issuance 
of municipal bonds exceeds that from tax revenues. This is 
equivalent to a household that borrows money more than it earns 
in salaries. 
  According to local governments' financial plans for the 
fiscal year 1994, the balance of loans, including bonds for 
public enterprises (which are born by local governments) and 
loans from the special account for tax allocated to local 
governments, increases dramatically to 102.83 trillion yen from 
81.09 trillion yen for the fiscal year 1993. This means that 
local governments will bear close to 40 percent of nation's 
long-term liabilities of approximately 161 trillion yen. 
<H5>  Distrustful of the National Government </H5>
  The total amount of municipal bonds to be issued in the 
fiscal year 1994 will be 10.39 trillion yen, an increase by 66.9 
percent from the previous year. As a result, the degree of 
dependence on municipal bonds is 13.1 percent, exceeding 12.6 
percent registered in 1979 following the second oil shock. 
  The increase in issuance of municipal bonds is due to the 
fact that local governments expanded the scope of their 
independent projects in order to stimulate the economy and to 
share the burden of the national government's fiscal crisis. 
Ibaraki Prefecture increased the amount of its independent 
projects by 23.5 percent, saying that "An economic recovery is 
the first priority for the nation as a whole." Thirty-two 
prefectures in total, including Hokkaido, Gunma, and Yamanashi, 
had a double-digit increase in the amount of their independent 
projects. According to fiscal plans for local governments, 
annual growth rate for independent projects was 12.0 percent in 
both fiscal years 1993 and 1994, surpassing greatly that of 
total expenditures. 
  Governor Morihiko Hiramatsu of Oita Prefecture, whose 1994 
budget shows more cash inflow from issuance of municipal bonds 
than from tax revenues, says, "Many independent projects of 
local governments should be carried out by the national 
government through issuance of construction bonds. Local 
governments are taking care of these, and municipal bonds are 
like national bonds in disguise." 
  For the first time in 18 years, the Ministry of Home Affairs 
has approved issuance of deficit-covering municipal bonds in the 
amount of 1.6 trillion yen so as to make up for reduction in 
income and resident taxes. Also, it has been providing 
"guidance" to local governments to secure needed funds in 
various ways -- bonds to supplement revenue reduction, loans 
from the special account for tax allocated to local governments, 
and so on. However, most of these loans are liabilities of local 
governments, except for the portion that is to be paid by tax 
allocated to local governments. 
  The Ministry of Home Affairs pretends to be calm about the 
current financial conditions of local governments, saying, 
"Aside from the question of medium- to long-term prospects, we 
don't think current conditions to be deteriorating." However, a 
local governmental official doesn't hide his feeling of distrust 
toward the national government: "Under the guidance of the 
national government, local governments are forced to make public 
investments. However, there is no guaranty that these 
investments will stimulate the economy, increase tax revenues, 
and help pay for the cost of municipal bonds." 
<H5>  Tax Revenues Can't Be Expected </H5>
  Among local banks, which are the partners of local 
governments, the following view is gaining strength: "The 
scenario for redemption of municipal bonds that relies upon an 
increase in tax revenues from an economic recovery will 
eventually come to a halt." It has been suggested that potential 
growth rate for the Japanese economy is becoming smaller. 
Therefore, even though the prospect for an economic recovery is 
gradually improving, a big increase in tax revenues as 
experienced in the past cannot be expected. As a result of the 
issuance of municipal bonds to expand the scope of their 
independent projects to stimulate the economy, local governments 
will be likely to face tight financial conditions in the mid- to 
long-term future. They have become reflective: "We can't follow 
the same old pattern of doing whatever the national budget 
dictates" (per Governor Daijiro Hashimoto of Kochi Prefecture). 
<H5>  [13 Apr 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] Administrative Reform Using Corporate Methods 
  As their fiscal conditions are affected by the recession and 
getting tighter at an accelerated speed, some local governments 
began to undertake restructuring of their operations. 
  Kobe City, which has been called "Kobe, Inc." because of its 
corporation-like skills in managing its municipal affairs, 
established a Headquarters for Promotion and Improvement of 
Administrative and Fiscal Reform at the end of March [1994]. It 
aims at consolidating offices with similar functions by making a 
thorough review of its organization, which has become too 
fragmented due to an expanded demand for administrative 
services. It plans to make a massive cut in the number of 
management positions. As the budgeted amount of revenues from 
city taxes for the fiscal year 1994 decreases from that in the 
previous year for the first time in 39 years, Mayor Kukitoshi 
Sasayama says, "This time, we are going to be as cost conscious 
as a private enterprise in tackling with our administrative 
reform." 
  Governor Yoshinobu Ishikawa of Shizuoka Prefecture is also 
aiming for an administrative reform by applying corporate 
management methods. In January he established a "Conference to 
Discuss the Ideal Way of Administration and Finance," inviting 
representatives from the industrial circle. Based on suggestions 
gathered from the conference, he eliminated 23 posts that were 
judged to be "unnecessary" in the organizational reform in April. 
  The wave of restructuring is also pressing in on those local 
governments that used to be considered affluent a few years ago. 
In compiling budgets for the fiscal year 1994, Kanagawa 
Prefecture has adopted a stringent standard that would cut the 
budget for each section by 20 percent in principle from the 
actual amount of spending in the previous year. In February 
[1994] it decided to consolidate eight extra-governmental 
organizations, including the association of prefectural parks. 
Some officials in the prefectural government ask with a sigh, 
"Do we really have to shed our blood to this extent?" 
  Some local governments are experiencing friction with their 
labor unions over their restructuring plans. Matsumoto City in 
Nagano Prefecture is the case in point. Late last year the city 
revised its broad policies on administrative reform, and 
announced its plan to reduce the number of work-site employees 
gradually, including those in charge of collecting garbage and 
preparing school lunches. Although the plan calls for a gradual 
shift toward the use of private companies by not hiring new 
employees to replace those who are retiring, negotiations with 
the labor union became difficult. In March the Prefectural and 
Local Labor Relations Commission became involved for the first 
time in 32 years to mediate between the two parties. 
  According to the estimate by the city, garbage disposal per 
ton costs 12,000 yen when done by the city, but it will cost 
7,000 yen, about 60 percent of the current cost, when 
commissioned to a private company. Although the friction with 
the labor union still continues over the contents of an 
agreement proposed by the Labor Relations Commission, Mayor 
Tadashi Ariga went ahead with the original plan of not hiring 
new employees to replace retirees in his personnel and 
recruitment policy in April. He is determined to improve 
efficiency by using private companies for their services. 
  Common among the local governments that began to implement 
administrative reform is a belief that "If we don't make a 
decisive action on administrative reform now, it will be too 
late" (per Mayor Ariga). This belief is enforced by a critical 
reconsideration of the bloated size of administrative 
organization and the sense of crisis over increasing 
administrative costs due to the aging society. 
<H5>  The Swelling Number of Employees </H5>
  The number of employees at local governments declined after 
the fiscal year 1982, but it began to increase since the fiscal 
year 1989, exceeding 1.16 million in general administrative 
fields--the largest number in history. Although this increase 
was caused in part by advance orders for public works and an 
increase in work load required by the nation's laws and 
regulations, some people say that "the bloated personnel cost is 
putting a cap on an increase in the expenditure for general 
construction projects" (per the Finance Division, Kanagawa 
Prefecture). 
  The same is true for extra-governmental organizations. 
Hokkaido began reviewing the extra-governmental organizations it 
helps finance. One of the factors that prompted this review is a 
research report compiled last fall by the Hokkaido Economic 
Association. Out of 88 organizations, 39 had operating losses, 
and 49 had been unable to eliminate their cumulative deficits. 
Two organizations had been accumulating losses over 20 years 
since their inception. Some people say that "there are some 
public corporations whose operations are quite unclear to us" 
(per the Hokkaido Economic Association). 
  As of January 1993, there were 6,659 extra-governmental 
organizations financed for more than 25 percent [of their 
equity] by respective local governments. The number of 
organizations has increased by 40 percent over six years. Many 
of these organizations had a bleak prospect for profitability 
even at the time of their inception. One organization in Kochi 
Prefecture, for example, retains 22 directors per a staff member. 
<H5>  Unnecessary Operations Abound </H5>
  In addition to the bloated size of organization, financial 
conditions of the local governments have been rapidly 
deteriorating due to a difficulty in increasing tax revenues and 
a large increase in issuance of municipal bonds. The outstanding 
balance of municipal bonds as of the end of the fiscal year 1993 
reached a historic high: "The balance in ordinary accounts alone 
exceeds well over 70 trillion yen" (per Finance Research and 
Guidance Division, Ministry of Home Affairs). Local governments 
seem to have driven themselves into a state where they must 
carry out restructuring, including cuts in the number of 
employees, which they have avoided so far. 
  Some people point out critically, however: "Although local 
governments are ripe for administrative reform, only a handful 
of them feel a genuine sense of crisis" (per Norio Sakata, 
professor at Toyo University). Because of fiscal crises at the 
national and local levels, there have been discussions on tax 
increases, including consumption tax. However, residents are 
keeping a watchful eye because they are the ones who will be 
burdened by such tax increases. 
  Professor Sakata believes: "Local governments have many 
operations that are not necessary today. If they have a courage 
to eliminate those operations, they will be able to slim down 
futher their administrative entities." The move toward 
restructuring, which has already been taken up at some 
progressive local governments, is likely to be widepread from 
now on.

  [Text] The Environment Agency will launch a three-year 
program beginning in this fiscal year to survey a variety of 
methods for rendering harmless substances that destroy the ozone 
layer such as special and substitute freons. The agency intends 
to survey existing methods of disposing of industrial waste as 
well as newly developing methods of disposal, pursue the 
commercialization of the latter methods and link the study to 
the construction of a social infrastructure for disposal of 
substances that destroy the ozone layer. 
  To be targeted in the survey will be the rotary kiln method 
currently used in the disposal of industrial waste, the cement 
kiln method used in conjunction with the manufacture of cement, 
and the plasma decomposition method being developed by the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Institute of 
Industrial Technology. The survey will include a review of 
issues that should be handled by the government in the future 
and will involve the effects of disposal methods in terms of 
whether they are able to dispose of hazardous waste without 
adversely affecting the ozone layer and an inventory of the 
number of disposal sites with specialized equipment using the 
best possible existing technology. Sources at the Comprehensive 
Air Control Section say, "We hope to clarify the advantages and 
disadvantages of various methods and expeditiously establish 
systems for disposal of substances that destroy the ozone layer."

  [Text] Estimates of changes achievable with the possible 
introduction of a summer time system which makes effective use 
of daylight hours during the summer were released on the 27th 
and included figures such as a 1.2 trillion yen increase in 
domestic demand, an increase of 0.3 percent in the gross 
national product and energy conservation equal to 550,000 
kiloliters of petroleum or 0.15 percent of the final consumption 
recorded for 1992. These figures will be included in a report 
recommending adoption of the summer time system to be submitted 
by June by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's 
Natural Resources and Energy Agency director's private-sector 
advisory organ, the Summer Time System Forum (chaired by 
professor Hiroaki Fukami of Keio University). 
  At the request of the forum, the nonprofit organization, 
"Leisure Time Development Center," compiled a report based on a 
questionnaire survey covering changes in lifestyles. The survey 
was premised on the assumption that clocks would be advanced for 
one hour during the April through September summer period. 
  As a result, the effect on domestic demand would be an 
increase of 10 percent over fiscal year 1992 to include 330 
million yen spent on the use of sports facilities such as golf 
shooting ranges and 64 million yen spent on sporting goods. 
Spending on movies, theaters, and concerts would reach a level 
of 145 million yen, reflecting a 30-percent increase, while 
spending on recreational travel would reach 344 million yen. 
  On the other hand, the effect on annual energy conservation 
converted into petroleum equivalents would be 310,000 kiloliters 
for domestic use and 240,000 kiloliters for commercial use. 
  The agency plans to use these estimates as a basis for 
appealing for implementation of the system as being beneficial 
in promoting changes to lifestyles that emphasize leisure 
pursuits.

  [Text] A partnership composed of Chiyoda Corporation and 
the Petroleum Energy Center (Yasutomo Tateuchi, chairman) has 
accepted a contract to participate in Chinese projects to 
conserve energy and preserve the environment. As part of a model 
project implemented by the New Energy Development Organization 
(NEDO), the partnership will provide technical assistance in the 
recycling of gases emitted in the operation of refineries to 
generate electrical power. The project will extend over three 
years from this fiscal year to encompass a 30-month construction 
period and will cost about 2.5 billion yen. Chiyoda Corp. has 
been exerting special efforts in winning contracts for 
environmental preservation projects in developing nations. 
  The model project represents a joint venture between NEDO, 
the Chinese National Planning Committee and China Petrochemical 
Company (CINOPEC) and involves the construction of an energy 
recovery system in the fluid contact cracking (FCC) unit of the 
Shengli Refinery with an annual capacity of 7 million tons in 
Zilu, Shandong Province. 
  The project has been subdivided so that Chiyoda Corporation 
will handle the engineering phase of the petroleum 
refinery-related system and the Petroleum Energy Center will 
handle the training of local personnel in the operation and 
maintenance of the new system. 
  The system will gasify heavy crude at high temperatures, 
cause the separation of high-octane gasolines and light oils and 
extract high-temperature, high-compression gas emissions from 
the newly constructed FCC recycling tower for in-house 
generation of electricity through the use of an expander 
turbine. The system will enable a reduction in energy 
consumption and enhance environmental preservation by capturing 
catalytic particles including heavy metals which were formerly 
released into the atmosphere. 
  Chiyoda Corporation has also tied up with the Engineering 
Promotion Association (Yoshihiko Kamitoko, chairman) in winning 
a contract from NEDO this fiscal year to install a simple 
sulphur removal system at China's Chongqing Zhangshou Chemical 
Plant as a model project promoting clean coal technology in 
support of the effective use of coal and prevention of 
environmental pollution. These organizations will beef up their 
technical assistance programs in response to the increasing 
number of environment-related projects in China and Southeast 
Asia.

  [Text] Katsuji Nakazawa of the Tokyo Mercantile Department 
reports, "Steel which is a typical commodity among industrial 
materials is suffering from low prices and prices for many types 
of steel have fallen to new historical lows because of slow 
demand and a barrage of imports. In the middle of March, the two 
major makers--Tokyo Steel Manufacturing and Nippon 
Steel--engaged in the third price war for H-shaped steel, which 
is a principal construction material. Currently, there are signs 
that prices may have bottomed out, but it is very difficult to 
predict future pricing. The question is, how will steel prices 
stand up in the future after having dropped for about four 
years? One must keep an eye on steel prices in any attempt to 
predict the future of the economy." 
  "Alas, Nippon Steel and Tokyo Steel Manufacturing engaged in 
the third price war for H-shaped steel." When Tokyo Steel 
Manufacturing announced in the middle of March that it would 
drop principal steel materials manufacturer prices by 20 percent 
and Nippon Steel immediately countered with its own price cuts, 
market sources which felt the brunt of the price war lost 
confidence in the markets. 
  Nippon Steel, the leading blast furnace operator, and Tokyo 
Steel Manufacturing, an independent electric furnace operator, 
had already engaged in two fierce sales wars. The first such war 
was triggered in September 1982 when Tokyo Steel indicated that 
it would compete with Nippon Steel in announcing that it would 
make H-shaped steel of the same standard as those produced in 
blast furnaces. The second war was initiated in May 1984 when 
Tokyo Steel Manufacturing announced a major reduction in 
H-shaped steel. 
  President Masanari Iketani of Tokyo Steel Manufacturing 
revealed his determination to compete with Nippon Steel in his 
remarks, "Blast furnace operators increased their production 
just when demand was decreasing. We will compete with them with 
prices that barely cover production costs." In the last two wars 
for H-shaped steel, Tokyo Steel Manufacturing's market share was 
boosted, but this time around, Nippon Steel has positioned its 
construction materials division strategically and is poised to 
maintain a firm competitive position. 
  In the handling of H-shaped steel, major distributors such 
as 
specially franchised outlets receive shipments and the 
franchised outlets impose a margin and resell to construction 
firms and secondary sales outlets. 
  Lingering demand owing to a prolonged recession has been 
complicated by the third price war, resulting in market prices 
for sales to construction firms which are one-half or 33,500 yen 
per ton compared to four years ago. 
  Ordinary shaped steel used for construction is also facing 
widespread price cuts. The market price of angle steel which is 
an important component of ordinary shaped steel was around 
47,000 yen per ton in the early part of April. Tokyo Steel 
Manufacturing which had once abandoned the production and sale 
of angle steel, reentered the market officially in May. It set 
the manufacturer price at 35,000 yen per ton, 20 percent below 
manufacturer prices of the other steel firms. As a result, 
market prices have dropped to the 42,000-yen level. 
  The price-cutting offensive being waged in the ordinary 
shaped steel sector which is a specialty of Toa Steel, an 
affiliate of NKK Steel, is part of Tokyo Steel Manufacturing's 
strategy to compete with the blast furnace group, but even 
sources in the electric furnace industry comment, "Tokyo Steel 
Manufacturing is in the process of trying to destroy weaker 
small producers." 
  In the area of plate steel, blast furnace firms and 
automobile makers have agreed to price cuts on automotive sheet 
metal for this fiscal year for the first time in five years, 
while an agreement has also been reached for price cuts on heavy 
plate steel for shipbuilders. The reason for such agreements lie 
in the fact that automobile makers and shipbuilders which until 
now used only domestic blast furnace steel had begun to procure 
steel from South Korea where prices are more than 20 percent 
below domestic prices. 
  Comments are heard from sources such as at Nissan Motors 
which say, "A strong yen has inspired a demand to lower material 
costs, which means that it is only logical to face up to demands 
for reducing the domestic-overseas price differentials on sheet 
metal." 
  "Prices May Stabilize, But Low Prices Will Persist for 
a Long Time" 
  The market price of H-shaped steel has fallen significantly 
along with cuts in manufacturer prices. Market prices on angle 
steel and special-shaped steel will probably drop further to 
levels commensurate with those established as manufacturer 
prices. However, since manufacturer prices have already fallen 
below manufacturing costs, there is no room from a cost 
standpoint for additional manufacturer price cuts. 
  Tokyo Steel Manufacturing has set the manufacturer's price 
of 
33,000 yen per ton for H-shaped steel as the "final price" from 
which further cuts cannot be made and has announced the 
cancellation of the system of after-the-fact adjustments to 
compensate distributors for losses suffered because of sharp 
market price drops which in effect were cuts in manufacturer 
prices. 
  Even Nippon Steel has analyzed "Japan Steel Manufacturing's 
market measures as being serious and has concluded that further 
price cuts will not take place," and has also implemented 
cancellations in the after-the-fact adjustment system. This 
means that an armistice is in the process of being established 
between Tokyo Steel Manufacturing and Nippon Steel on H-shaped 
steel where sharp price cuts had taken place. 
  Since distributors will move to raise resale prices in 
response to pricing measures taken by the makers, the market for 
construction steel such as H-shaped steel should form a bottom. 
However, the important private-sector demand for steel used in 
office buildings will most likely not recover for another two to 
three years. A substantial rise in overall construction steel 
prices will be difficult and the probable scenario will reflect 
stable low prices. 
  Prices for sheet steel used on automobiles and domestic 
appliances will bounce off the bottom owing to the recovery in 
consumer purchases. Some steel makers like Kawasaki Steel say 
that "initial steel crude production plans of 22.4 million tons 
for the April-June period have been revised upward by 1.6 
million tons because of increased demand for sheet steel." 
Prices will also stop dropping. However, fierce competition from 
imports will preclude any attempt at price hikes and any 
bottoming of prices will result in low prices for the long term. 
  "Price Wars Will Heat Up Further and Price Drops Will 
Continue" 
  The steel makers engaged in reckless expansion during the 
bubble period. Capacity for production of H-shaped steel has 
grown to 7 million tons. However, current demand is 3.5 million 
tons per annum, meaning that one-half of the capacity is excess. 
As long as excess capacity remains, the steel makers may speak 
of production cuts, but will not be able to enforce major 
production cuts. 
  Even if H-shaped steel prices stop falling temporarily, 
there 
is the possibility that makers will look upon the situation as a 
"good opportunity" to resume increased production, create 
production excesses and cause prices to drop again. The 
armistice on the third H-shaped steel war may just last until 
inventory adjustments are completed and later lapse into another 
"shooting war." 
  Beginning in April, Tokyo Steel Manufacturing entered the 
steel sheet pile market which in the past was monopolized by the 
blast furnace operators. Manufacturer prices were set at about 
one-half of those established by blast furnace operators. It was 
as if it had challenged the blast furnace operators as a "price 
destroyer." This price war affecting steel sheet pile and angle 
steel will not end until weak makers either withdraw from the 
market or fall by the wayside. 
  "Recovery in Economy Will Cause Sharp Turnaround" 
  Steel demand for public works projects will increase sharply 
after summer. Private-sector demand for automobiles and domestic 
appliances should recover and progress smoothly and corporate 
capital investments should recover gradually. Inventory of 
H-shaped steel held by the "Tokiwa-kai," wholesalers who handle 
Nippon Steel's products, will drop significantly during the 
summer. Demand will turn around and will cause the 
supply-and-demand situation to tighten and for market prices to 
rise sharply toward levels which prevailed before the current 
recession.

  [Text] Ryoichi Emura of the Osaka Economic Department 
reports, "Kyoei Steel (Maikata city, Osaka; Koichi Takashima, 
president), a Sumitomo Metal Industries-affiliated electric 
furnace operator, is engaged in an aggressive expansion 
strategy. Overseas, it purchased Florida Steel in the United 
States for about 44 billion yen in the year before last and has 
launched a joint venture with the Vietnam Steel Public 
Corporation. In Japan, it has purchased the H-shaped steel beam 
plant of Sumitomo-Kajima Steel Works and has contracted to 
handle the restructuring of the financially ailing Taiyo Steel 
Works (currently undergoing corporate reorganization 
proceedings) and Yasaku Steel Works. All of these firms will be 
used as stepping stones to expand Kyoei Steel's overseas 
operations." 
  Among electric furnace operators where the news is not very 
cheerful in recent days, the talk seems to focus on the vitality 
of Kyoei Steel to the effect that "Kyoei Steel has made another 
aggressive move." First, in early December last year, Vice 
President Shigemitsu Takashima assumed the position of 
administrator of the bankrupt Taiyo Steel Works with liabilities 
of 90 billion yen. In mid-February of this year it purchased the 
16.65 million share third-party placement of stock priced at 
2,497.5 million yen and absorbed raw steel materials maker 
Yasaku Steel as a subsidiary. 
  Then, one month later in the latter part of March, it agreed 
to buy the electric furnace plant of Soba Steel Company and 
succeeded in entering the Kanto market which it had targeted for 
some time. President Takeharu Nakamura of Nakayama Steel Works 
which is also a Kansai steel maker expresses surprise, as he 
says, "I wonder how they can afford to invest so much during 
this period." Kyoei Steel's expansion activities are such that 
even President Yasuo Niimiya of parent company Sumitomo Metal 
Works wryly smiles as he says, "It seems like he may be 
overdoing it." 
  Vice President Shigemitsu Takashima merely stresses "return 
of a favor" in connection with the assistance extended to Taiyo 
Steel Works as he says, "We merely wanted to repay Daiwa Bank 
for the favor that they extended to us many years ago." By 
"favor," they are referring to the fact that the bank extended 
an emergency loan to Kyoei Steel during the recession that 
followed immediately after the oil shock in the 1970's. However, 
a common viewpoint assumed by sources in the industry is that "a 
shrewd Kyoei Steel would not extend assistance to Taiyo Steel 
Works simply for a reason of that nature." 
  Initially, Daiwa Bank, which served as the principal banker 
for Taiyo Steel Works, made a list of machinery makers dealing 
with the bank in search of an administrator. However, all of the 
candidate administrator firms rejected the appointment, saying, 
"We might assume the administratorship if we were talking only 
about the parent company of Taiyo Steel Works, but assumption of 
such duties for all seven subsidiaries of the group would be 
difficult." And, just before the time limit for appointment of 
the administrator, Kyoei Steel which hardly had any direct 
dealings with Taiyo Steel Works was chosen to provide an 
administrator. The degree to which recognition of Kyoei Steel 
among Daiwa Bank officials rose can be seen in the words 
expressed by bank officials when Kyoei Steel was appointed to 
supply an administrator in the words, "Kyoei Steel is gaining a 
lot by just repaying an old debt to Daiwa Bank." Even for Yasaku 
Steel Works, arrangements had been made for loans to be issued 
by Yasaku Steel Works' main bank, The Industrial Bank of Japan. 
  Future operating plans which have been announced thus far to 
include the reorganization of Florida Steel and the joint 
venture in Vietnam, which is targeted for initial operations in 
the beginning of 1996, indicate that each project will require 
funding in the amount of several billion yen. Kyoei Steel, which 
expanded its relationships with financial institutions through 
the reorganization of Taiyo Steel Works and Yasaku Steel Works, 
has little to be concerned about in terms of procuring adequate 
capital. 
  Kyoei Steel is conducting itself as if it were the 
"assistance specialist" for its parent firm. In June 1994, Kyoei 
Steel Manufacturing Company (Wakayama city; president, 
Shigemitsu Takashima), a subsidiary of Kyoei Steel, will 
purchase Sumitomo Metal-Kajima Steel Work's large H-shaped steel 
beam plant located in Kajima machi, Ibaragi prefecture. The 
purchase price will be between 17 billion and 18 billion yen. 
  When Sumitomo Metal Industries transfers the sales function 
of H-shaped steel beams to Kyoei Steel Manufacturing Company, 
costs will be reduced by about 3,000 yen per ton and a system 
will be established that will make the H-shaped steel beams 
competitive with those produced by other domestic electric 
furnace operators such as Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Company and 
imported from overseas sources. 
  Kyoei Steel's domestic and foreign expansion strategy is 
backed up by President Takashima's skillful management 
capabilities and abundant overseas' experience which he uses to 
influence financial institutions and the parent company. 
Accordingly, he does not give the impression of being reckless. 
  Twenty years ago, Kyoei Steel established Auburn Steel as a 
joint venture with Ataku Industries in Auburn, New York. The 
joint venture served as a forerunner for the establishment of 
U.S. operations by Japanese businesses, but the bankruptcy of 
Ataku Industries caused Kyoei's share of the firm to drop from 
40 percent to 10 percent. President Takashima says, "Since 
expanding to the United States was a dream from my younger 
years, I wanted to make a second attempt at opening a plant in 
the United States." 
  The purchase of Florida Steel was strongly opposed not only 
within Kyoei Steel, but by Sumitomo Metal Industries, the parent 
company. The reason was that the purchase of Florida Steel 
represented a major purchase; its sales were equivalent to 50 
percent of those of Kyoei Steel. However, in the final analysis, 
a decision was made at the highest echelons of the parent firm 
to go through with the purchase. 
  Although President Takashima has a strong preference for 
expansionary policies, his outlook for the domestic market is 
gloomy. He is pessimistic to the point of saying, "It is only a 
matter of time before domestic production of steel crude drops 
below an annual rate of 90 million tons. I believe they will 
drop close to a level of 80 million tons a year." The reason for 
deciding to proceed with investments in Vietnam, which most 
Japanese corporations avoid because of concern for inadequate 
infrastructure, as the first among Japanese steel makers is 
based on the judgment that "We have no choice but to seek a 
means of survival overseas in order to look forward to future 
growth." 
  President Takashima, who considers the joint venture in 
Vietnam as the "president's last major project of a lifetime," 
is 71 years old. A strong replacement candidate is his eldest 
son Vice President Shuichiro Takashima, but he is only 36 and 
has only limited experience. Even if overseas production begins 
to run smoothly, there is the remaining major issue of how to 
establish a firm footing in the fiercely competitive Kanto 
market in Japan. 
  Kyoei Steel has persisted in maintaining a family-run 
business, saying "Steel is the family's business." The company 
will be faced with the urgent need within the next several years 
to find someone to take over from President Takashima who has 
exercised considerable managerial skills.

<F P=106> [By Kiyoshi Komatsu] </F>
  [Text] Blast furnace makers are emphasizing the development 
of electric furnace-related technology. Kobe Steel has developed 
a new manufacturing technology for the production of reduced 
steel which is a raw material used in electric furnaces and has 
decided to build a prototype production plant. On the other 
hand, electric furnaces for which orders have been placed by 
South Korea's Pohang Integrated Steel Manufacturing Company with 
Nippon Steel incorporate the newest technology which operates 
two electric furnaces from one power source. Electric furnace 
makers are powerful rivals of blast furnace makers. However, 
while the blast furnace method of manufacturing steel has become 
mature, advances in the electric furnace technology are in the 
process of accelerating and it appears that the blast furnace 
makers have decided that such advances provide an opportunity 
for expanding their scope of operations. 
  Managing Director Takuya Negami of Kobe Steel reflects hope 
for the reduced steel manufacturing process which the company 
developed jointly with its Charlotte, North Carolina, subsidiary 
Midrex, in saying, "We would like to link the new technology to 
orders for new plants, after providing a period for observation 
of responses from foreign electric furnace makers." 
  Already, Midrex is making practical use of a manufacturing 
technology that uses natural gas as a reduction material, but 
there is an increasing need for a new technology that uses coal 
as a raw material because it is procurable by steel makers at a 
lower cost than natural gas on a worldwide basis. 
  The new manufacturing technology's most significant feature 
is that coal and pulverized ore can be used as raw materials 
without any preprocessing. Among reduced steel manufacturing 
processes using coal as the reduction agent, the Corex method 
developed by Voest-Alpine of Austria is well known, but that 
method involves problems such as requiring 1) calcinated pellets 
baked through a process using pulverized ore and 2) gasification 
of coal in a smelter, and it involves the production of large 
quantities of gas that cannot be recycled. 
  Kobe Steel has conducted research in a technology using raw 
pellets representing a mixture of coal dust and pulverized ore. 
Additionally, the company developed a manufacturing technology, 
which is time-saving and low-cost, providing for rapid reduction 
through the use of a furnace with a rotating floor. As an 
example, former Midrex methods required eight to 12 hours for 
the reduction process, but the new method accomplishes the same 
task in eight to 10 minutes. 
  Kobe Steel will complete construction of a prototype plant 
at 
its Kakogawa Steel Works in Kakogawa city, Hyogo Prefecture, by 
the middle of 1995. 
  Capital investments for the prototype plant will be 1.4 
billion yen. After the plant is test operated, the company plans 
to export the new furnaces from 1996 primarily to the United 
States where there is a shortage of high-quality scrap steel 
used as raw materials in electric furnaces and to China and 
Southeast Asia where growth in demand for steel can be expected. 
  On the other hand, the productivity of electric furnaces 
ordered by Pohang Integrated Steel Company from Nippon Steel is 
30 percent higher than older models. They are of the 
two-furnace, one electric source, direct-current type with a 
capacity of 1.3 million tons, and, as one furnace operates, it 
produces gases used by the second furnace to preheat scrap, 
conserves electrical power and provides for high-efficiency 
operation of the system. 
  Reportedly, the recent contract was awarded to Nippon Steel, 
because its subsidiary Kansai Pellet Center (Sakai city, Osaka; 
Hanji Oniwa, president) had built and accumulated technical 
experience in operating a similar furnace. The Pohang facility 
is scheduled to begin operating in 1996. Nippon Steel will sell 
this type of furnace aggressively in overseas markets. 
  In Japan, Tokyo Steel Manufacturing Company has launched the 
production of hot coils and is steadily progressing on 
preparations to produce cold-rolled steel plates both on 
electric furnaces, which means that electric furnace makers pose 
a major threat to blast furnace makers. On the other hand, 
Nippon Steel executives have reached the conclusion that the 
electric furnace boom will continue in the United States and 
Southeast Asia and that, "In Asia, it would be more advantageous 
for Nippon Steel if electric furnaces were built rather than 
integrated steel plants with blast furnaces." The reason is that 
adjustments in output are difficult with blast furnaces and 
their use in other countries would mean that, when domestic 
demand fell, there would be the potential that excess production 
would be exported to Japan. Even blast furnace makers are 
expected to actively promote the sale of electric furnaces 
primarily in overseas areas.

  [Text] (Chicago, 1 April--Koji Yamamoto) Sumitomo Metal 
Industries has entered into a technical alliance with Birmingham 
Steel of Alabama, a leading U.S. electrical furnace (minimill) 
operator. Sumitomo Metal Industries will provide technical 
assistance in the construction and operation of a steel bar 
plant which Birmingham Steel has planned for construction in the 
continental United States. Sumitomo Metal Industries hopes to 
further its knowledge concerning the operation of electric 
furnaces as part of its plan to build its own strategy for such 
furnaces by expanding its alliances with leading U.S. electric 
furnace operators. 
  Birmingham Steel plans to double the production of steel 
bars 
to a level of 1.1 million tons at its AS&amp;W plant in Ohio, a 
medium-size steel bar maker which it purchased last year. Total 
capital to be invested has been set at $70 million and a search 
is underway for the plant site with a target plant opening date 
of January 1996. Sumitomo Metal Industries will provide know how 
on the selection of equipment, plant layout and operations. It 
will dispatch technicians to the plant site who will provide 
on-site training to plant workers for an unspecified period 
after the plant commences operations. Sumitomo Metal Industries 
will also assist in the modernization of the AS&amp;W plants 
currently in operation.

build. President J. Payton of Louisville Forge visited Japan on 
5 April to sign the contract. 
  Louisville Forge supplies the three major automakers and 
Japanese automakers with North American plants with forged 
components. Louisville Forge has maintained a technical 
assistance agreement with Aichi Steel Works since July 1990 and 
in August of last year it had reached a technical assistance 
agreement on the manufacture of crankshafts using "nontempered 
steel" which does not involve heat processing. Louisville Forge 
is formulating plans for relocation and construction of a new 
plant, but the timing and location are still undetermined.

  [Text] On 20 May, Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation (Donen) publicly disclosed for the first 
time that a large amount of plutonium had adhered to equipment. 
  As much as 70 kilograms of plutonium stuck to equipment at 
Donen's plutonium fuel plant (located in Tokaimura, Ibaraki 
Prefecture). 
  There are 17 airtight containers, called glove boxes, in the 
fuel plant. To prevent possible radiation contamination, 
operators wear rubber globes and operate the equipment installed 
in the containers while standing outside. 
  Plutonium adhesion occurred inside the glove boxes. Blackish 
plutonium reportedly could be seen stuck to pipes and other 
equipment. Of the 17 containers, large amounts of the 
plutonium, 60 percent of the total amount, was accumulated in 
two containers containing equipment to harden powder plutonium 
into fuel pellets, and another container which contains machines 
to grind the pellets to a unified, standard size. 
  Currently the container which contains the largest amount of 
adhered plutonium is not in use. However, because of strong 
radiation, observers studied the containers through a thick 
glass wall. As a result of this, no plutonium inside the 
containers was visible to the naked eye. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) asked the fuel 
plant to reduce the amount of adhered plutonium. Measurement 
error is within plus or minus 10 percent and 70 kilograms of 
plutonium is involved in this case. Therefore nobody would 
notice even if enough plutonium to produce an atomic bomb was 
missing. Many other countries are concerned about the case and 
foreign media from nine countries sent representatives to see 
the containers.

  [Text] On the morning of 18 May, Prime Minister Tsutomu 
Hata's advisory "Defense Issues Council" (chaired by Asahi 
Breweries Chairman Kotaro Higuchi) held a meeting at the prime 
minister's office. At the meeting, the members agreed to 
propose a review of the 1976 "National Defense Program Outline" 
on three subjects: 1) international situation; 2) comprehensive 
security policies; and 3) tangible measures for defense buildup. 
  On the "international situation," the panel is going to 
discuss military and social trends of the present world, 
focusing on "Japan's increasing responsibilities." Regarding 
the "comprehensive security policies," the panel will advocate 
"comprehensive measures to appropriately cope with `various 
threats'" in consideration of both military and economic trends.

  [Text] The Air Force is reviewing its plan to buy G-222 
transport aircraft from Italy, previously approved by the 
Cabinet, Air Force Commander Air Chief Marshal M.R. Siriphong 
Thongyai said. 
  ACM M.R. Siriphong said the Air Force had told Supreme 
Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari of its position. 
He said some aspects of the purchase agreement draft needed 
correction. The contract could not be signed until this was 
done as it could cost the country a lot more money. 
  He declined to elaborate apart from saying the issue had not 
been finalised. 
  The Air Force has provided the Supreme Command with a number 
of options in dealing with the problem. 
  Air Force sources said the urgency of the deal appeared to 
have been overtaken by other priorities after a long delay in 
the purchase process. 
  Supreme Commander ACM Woranat declined to comment. He is 
awaiting an official explanation from the Air Force.

  [Text] There was a report in the Japanese press that Japan 
imported a total of 50,000 tons of rice from Australia in 1993 
and is expected to import more than 200,000 tons in 1994. This 
prompted speculation that Japan might review its rice importing 
policy and probably would import only the short and medium 
grains from the United States and Australia under the new 
regulations of GATT. It is also anticipated that Japan will 
reduce imports of long-grain rice from Thailand in keeping with 
the GATT regulations. 
  Concerning the said report, the Thai commercial counsellor 
in 
Tokyo checked with Japanese rice traders and trading 
associations. From their explanations, it was learned that the 
report was unfounded. Japanese officials explained that the 
Japanese Government had completed negotiations for rice 
purchases in April and is committed to importing 760,000 tons of 
rice from Thailand. They confirmed that there would be no change 
in this policy. 
  Japanese officials explained that, under the new GATT 
regulation, which will take effect in 1995, fixing minimum 
access at 4 to 8 percent of local rice concumption, there was a 
fear that the volume of rice imports would be smaller than at 
present. Anyway, there has been no announcement about the 
reduction of the amount of imports from any particular country. 
Currently, Thai rice exported to Japan is used as food, for 
production of sweets, and in food processing factories. It is 
even believed that there would be a greater demand for Thai rice 
in Japan because Thai rice is cheaper than rice imported from 
other countries.

  [Text] Vietnam perceives that Thailand has a lot of 
experience in marketing rice so it is asking for help in this 
area, according to the Thai deputy commerce minister. Chaiyot 
Sasomsap met yesterday with his Vietnamese counterpart. 
  Vietnam is faced with decreases in orders from African 
countries which have devaluated their currencies, Chaiyot said. 
  The Vietnamese mission, comprised of senior officials and 
representatives of the private sector, is led by Nguyen Xuan 
Quang, the deputy trade minister. 
  The talks, to be held for three days to Wednesday, focus on 
the sharing of information, marketing and the control of 
production. 
  Chaiyot said if the two parties agree to exchange more 
information it would benefit both sides. He complained that 
Vietnam does not disclose much information about its rice 
production and marketing, while Thailand discloses a lot of 
information to them. 
  "We don't exactly know when Vietnam's rice is to come on the 
market. If it is not on the same month (as ours) it is great," 
Chaiyot said. 
  Chaiyot wants the two sides to reach an agreement to 
cooperate in marketing, sharing the world market. 
  "Thailand could sacrifice on its part, letting Vietnam be 
the 
biggest exporter of 15 per cent rice," he said. 
  The two sides might also cooperate to limit rice production 
in order to avoid an oversupply on the world market, which would 
lead to lower prices. 
  The results of technical discussions will be submitted to 
Chaiyot and his counterpart Quang on Wednesday for approval. If 
any further progress has been made the two sides will use the 
results as principles for cooperation but if not the two sides 
will follow a memorandum of understanding signed last year. 
  Chaiyot said the Vietnam will export this year about 1.7 
million tonnes, down from the previous estimate of 2.2 million 
tonnes. Thailand will export about 4.8 million tonnes, same as 
last year. 
  Rice exports from the two countries of about 6.5 million 
tonnes represent 40 per cent of world rice exports. Each 
country produces 20 million tonnes per annum.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "ASEAN's new bully boy"] </F>
  [Text] As if twisting Philippine President Fidel Ramos' 
arm into imposing a ban on all foreign participants from 
attending the Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor was not 
enough, Indonesia has now detained 250 Filipino fishermen for 
allegedly poaching in their waters, in a bid to get the 
conference canceled altogether. 
  The Filipino fishermen from South Cotabato were reportedly 
operating along the Philippine-Indonesian border and reports 
reaching Manila indicate that they are being "detained and 
harassed" in Indonesia. 
  On Friday, President Ramos ordered the Bureau of Immigration 
to ban foreigners attending the Manila conference scheduled 
between May 31-June 4 in a bid to appease the Indonesian 
government. This rather unfortunate action was taken after 
special envoy Raul Manglapus failed to mollify an angry Jakarta 
on why the Philippines could not cancel the meeting of NGOs and 
academics. Manglapus explained that it would be 
unconstitutional to do so because the Philippine Charter allows 
for freedom of association and free speech like all truly 
civilized nations of this world. 
  But free speech and freedom of association and respect for 
the constitution are completely alien to the Suharto government. 
Because of this, before Ramos made his decision on Friday, 
Jakarta had already resorted to the following acts of diplomatic 
blackmail to show its displeasure: -- Threatened to scrap a 
meeting scheduled for mid-June in Jakarta arranged by Indonesia 
between the Philippine government and a Muslim separatist group, 
the Moro National Liberation Front, to end more than 20 years of 
fighting between the rebels and Manila; -- Forced a number of 
industrialists affiliated with the local chapter of the 
Indonesian Chamber of Commerce in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, to 
cancel a planned investment involving billions of dollars in 15 
strategic sectors in Davao, Philippines; -- Forced three 
Indonesian business delegations to cancel their trips to the 
Philippines, and a visit to Manila by a student delegation from 
Jakarta's Jayabaya University was put on hold in reaction to the 
Manila conference; -- Forced 200 Indonesian businessmen to 
withdraw from a regional conference due to be held this week in 
the southern Davao city to flesh out President Ramos' East Asia 
Growth Area (EAGA). 
  It seems that Indonesia now is acting like the region's 
bully 
boy and rather unfortunately Ramos has allowed the Philippines 
to be cowed into toeing the Jakarta line over East Timor. 
Indonesia's actions over the week are not the true mark of a 
regional leader, but rather that of a regional thug. 
  Till the November 1991 Dili massacre, in which scores of 
East 
Timorese were shot dead in front of Western journalists, East 
Timor was the typical story of a war in the Third World -- a 
messy struggle in a faraway country of the sort that perhaps 
makes headlines in the West for a day or two, then gradually 
slips out of view and out of mind. 
  Jakarta quite clearly wants misinformation and lies to 
prevail over the truth of its invasion and forceful annexation 
of East Timor in December 1975. The fact of the matter is that 
within a few weeks close to 60,000 Timorese were killed -- 10 
per cent of the population -- when Indonesian commandos invaded 
the island. Since 1975, aid agencies have estimated that 
200,000 East Timorese have died from various causes. The sad 
fact is that civilized Western countries share the guilt of this 
slaughter by virtue of actively giving the Suharto government 
military and diplomatic support in its monstrous war crimes, 
support given in the name of the crusade against international 
communism. 
  The East Timor issue has been silenced for two decades, but 
it would be wishful thinking on the part of Jakarta to expect it 
to continue to be silenced now in the region.

  [Text] Officials of Thailand, Laos, and the UN High 
Commission for Refugees [UNHCR] are to meet in Chiang Rai next 
month to find ways to speed up the repatriation of the remaining 
25,000 Laotian refugees in Thailand to Laos by the end of this 
year, according to a Lao diplomat. 
  The Laotian Ambassador to Thailand, Bounkeut Sangsomsak, 
said 
the meeting would examine ways to meet the deadline of the 
UNHCR- sponsored repatriation and what could be done if the 
refugees remained after 1994. 
  Speaking on Thursday at a seminar on Thai-Laotian Relations, 
organized by Chulalongkon University's International 
Understanding Program, Bounkeut said there should be no 
mandatory repatriation for the sake of meeting the deadline. 
  "This will be against the agreement reached by the three 
parties," the ambassador said. 
  In 1991, Thailand, Laos and the UNHCR agreed during their 
first meeting in Luang Prabang, Laos, to a speedy three-year 
repatriation program of the refugees as Thailand had given an 
ultimatum to close its last refugee camp at Ban Na Pho, in Nong 
Khai province, by the end of this year. 
  Deputy Secretary-General of the National Security Council 
(NSC) Khachatphai Burutphat, who joined the panel, has 
reaffirmed the government's decision to close Ban Na Pho. 
Khachatphai contended that at present there were many refugees 
willing to return home. 
  "There is a need to convince the refugees that their 
homeland 
had changed for the better under the new economic mechanism and 
that they should return to help develop their country," he said. 
  He also urged the UNHCR to help in the quick return of the 
remaining refugees. At the third tripartite meeting in 
Savannakhet, Laos, last year, Thailand, in order to accelerate 
the repatriation program, proposed that the UNHCR expand their 
present overcrowded reception centres in Laos to accommodate 
more returnees in transition. 
  According to the Foreign Ministry's press statement, only 
8,619 refugees have returned home since the implementation of 
the three-year program in 1991. This includes the latest batch 
of 405 Hmong last month. Of the remaining 25,000 refugees there 
are about 22,000 Hmongs.

  [Text] Heavy fighting continued between Khun Sa's army and 
Burmese troops in Shan State close to the Thai border. 
According to a latest report, Burma sent 10 battalions more of 
reinforcements in an attempt to retake Mong Chot. 
  A reliable source reported to MATICHON on 23 May that, 
during 
the night of 22 May, 10 battalions of the 23d brigade, with its 
stronghold west of Salween River and about 8 kilometers from 
Mong Chot, mounted an offensive against Khun Sa's soldiers and 
managed to take back the military stronghold at Mong Chot at 
dawn on 23 May. There was no report on the casualties of both 
sides, but Khun Sa's men reportedly pulled back from Mong Chot 
toward Doi Na Mu and Doi Nam Cham. 
  As for the situation in Chiang Mai, MATICHON's correspondent 
reported intense fighting at the border in Wiang Haeng, Mae Ai, 
and Fang Districts in Chiang Mai. There was also fierce 
fighting opposite Muang District of Mae Hong Son Province, about 
10 kilometers from the Thai-Burmese border, with the two sides 
pounding artillery fire on each other continuously. 
  The source reported that troops of Khun Sa advanced toward 
Thachilek-Napong and, in the past two days, launched three 
attacks on Burmese Government troops, killing and wounding many. 
They apparently wanted to capture Thachilek. The Burmese 
border pass at Thachilek opposite Mae Sai in Chiang Rai was 
closed, as the Burmese military was recruiting men to be porters 
and soldiers. It also wanted to black out news about the 
situation in Burma to keep it from leaking to the Thai side. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Kansai Chaiyen, a leading member of the Shan 
State Restoration Council, said the Burmese Government proposed 
a cease-fire negotiation after three weeks of fighting. Burma 
claimed that several factions of Khun Sa's army had already 
agreed to a cease-fire negotiation. However, the Shan State 
Restoration Council made it clear that there would be a 
negotiation only when Burmese troops had pulled out from Shan 
State, and that the negotiation be conducted in a country other 
than Burma.

  [Text] Chiang Rai -- The Border Patrol Police and Army 
Region 3 troops have pushed back about 300 Burmese who tried to 
flee fighting by entering Thailand through the border pass at 
Mae Sai. The Burmese refugees, mostly males, said they escaped 
from the Burmese army because it tried to force them to 
transport artillery over difficult terrain to fire on drug 
warlord Khun Sa's Muang Tai Army (MTA). 
  Sources said all the Burmese have been sent to a temporary 
refugee centre at Wat Wianghom in Mae Sai District. The 
officials said repatriation would be possible only after the 
fighting on the Burmese side had ceased. 
  Chiang Rai Governor Khamron Bunchoet said it was not 
necessary at this time to close the commercial passage between 
Mae Sai and Burma's Thachilek town, reasoning that the battle 
had not threatened the people living in the border town or in 
the surrounding areas. Last year the Burmese government closed 
the border point which resulted in a downturn in the tremendous 
volume of trade between both countries, he said. 
  In the latest development, the battle between the Burmese 
National Army and Khun Sa's MTA, which is sited 40 kilometres 
south of Burma's Thachilek town and about 20 kilometres from Ban 
Hua Kham in Mae Fa Luang district, yesterday continued for the 
fourth day.
