<F P=106> ["Dangerous Move To Reinvade Korea" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- Tsuboi, chief of the 
security section of the cabinet of Japan, told the budgetary 
committee of the House of Representatives on May 23 that a 
"joint council" consisting of departemental chiefs of the 
ministries and agencies of the Japanese Government had been 
formed as regards the "suspicion of nuclear development" by the 
DPRK, at which "the situation of North Korea is analysed", 
according to a report. 
  That day, defence bureau director of the Defence Agency of 
Japan Murada blared at the same place that Japan "is studying 
rules of actions of the self-defence forces [SDF] involving 
naval deterrence, combat regulations and the sphere of aerial 
action" to "cope with an emergency case connected with the 
`nuclear suspicion' against North Korea". 
  Earlier, the ground "SDF" showed a bellicose move of working 
out a new strategy attatching importance to "the influence of 
the situation on the Korean peninsula" which would replace the 
strategy of "attaching importance to the North". 
  Facts eloquently show that the Japanese reactionaries are 
promoting on a full-dressed stage the reorganisation of the 
wartime system for a war of reinvasion against DPRK under the 
name of "reaction in case of emergency", taking issue with the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. 
  But the Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, 
clearly seeing the possible consequences of their reckless acts, 
and promptly give up the moves to stage a comeback to the Korean 
peninsula.

<F P=106> ["Outcries Over `Threat From Japan' in the U.S." -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a 
by-lined article today says the U.S.-Japan relations in the past 
were relations of senior-junior alliance in which Japan was 
thoroughly subordinated to the United States but, now, Americans 
are raising a hue and cry over "threat from Japan" as Japan's 
ambition to overshadow the United States has surfaced following 
the end of the Cold War. 
  Noting that some Americans are of the opinion that Japan 
might be the only country which can say "no" to the United 
States in the post-Cold War period, the article says: 
  Japan at last began to say "no" to the United States. The 
Japanese prime minister said "no" when discussing trade friction 
and other issues with the U.S. President during his visit to the 
United States last year, thus breaking down the talks. 
  The United States is very nervous about such developments. 
It is alerted against the stark fact that Japan may become its 
archrival in the future in executing its global strategy. For 
their conflicting interests the United States is trying to hold 
down Japan. But Japan has built up "defences" and is stubbornly 
resisting it. 
  Noteworthy here is it that the United States is being driven 
into a position of passive defence. 
  After the Second World War Japan has surfaced as an economic 
power under the U.S. shadow. It has unfolded a challenging and 
ambitious economic strategy and began to regard the United 
States as nothing, in the belief that in the present-day world 
where the Cold War has come to an end the economic potential is 
the real strength and, accordingly, those who established 
economic supremacy would come at the helm of power for world 
domination. 
  In recent years the United States has annually suffered a 
deficit of more than 50 billion dollars in trade with Japan. 
Worse still, Japan is extensively buying land and businesses of 
the United States. Words are rife now in the U.S. public that 
should such development continue the Japanese capital would 
swallow up the whole territory of the United States some time in 
the future. The United States is raising terrific outcries over 
Japan's trade offensive, calling it the "second attack on Pearl 
Harbour". 
  Meanwhile, Japan, broadening new markets, is continually 
increasing investments to form its economic sphere. 
Subsequently, the United States is gradually going into the 
passive. 
  Japan is also trying by degrees to free itself from the U.S. 
control militarily. By legalizing the troop dispatch overseas 
of its "self-defence forces" and accelerating its own nuclear 
armament Japan is intending to take the initiative and act a 
political power in the international arena. 
  Now, Japan has made all material preparations for the 
production of nuclear weapons any moment. The United States is 
very uneasy about this. 
  Some quarters of Japan say they cannot forget the atomic 
bombing of the United States on the territory of Japan, and 
agitate people by saying Japan must call it "to account for" 
this in the future. 
  Judging from all this, one can see that what Japan seeks is 
to exhaust the United States in the economic, military and other 
domains and take the initiative in the international arena. 
  At present, the United States is trying to keep Japan under 
its control, and the latter is intending to get the upper hand 
by fostering its own strength without letup, while pretending to 
make concessions to the former and seemingly currying favor with 
it. 
  The relations between the United States and Japan, each 
having an axe to grind, will take a turn for the worse with the 
passage of time.

<F P=106> ["Ridiculous Utterances of Nuclear Criminal" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- Secretary General of the 
Japan Renewal Party (Shinseito) Ozawa, a backstage manipulator 
of Japan's nuclear armament and moves to become a military 
power, reportedly said in his recent speech that North Korea's 
"nuclear arms development program" might drive the situation on 
the Korean peninsula to a "grave crisis". 
  This balderdash of Ozawa is a sheer distortion of the 
reality. It is a despicable jargon meant to do harm to the DPRK 
and justify their criminal nuclear ambition on any account. 
  We cannot but be on our guard against the extreme moves 
hostile to Korea of Ozawa who let out a provocative remark again 
this time. 
  It is an undeniable stark reality that the basic factor of 
the critical phase being created in the situation of the Korean 
peninsula is the reckless war manoeuvres of the U.S. and 
Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean puppet clique to 
contain the DPRK militarily. 
  We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the 
Japanese reactionaries are stepping up their nuclear armament 
and moves for the conversion of Japan into a military power with 
the aim of staging a comeback to Korea and establishing 
domination over Asia. 
  Today Japan is totally branded as an unpardonable nuclear 
criminal and has to sit in the dock before the international 
community. 
  The recent outburst of Ozawa revealed his extremely 
insidious 
attempt to lay the blame at other's door, avoid sitting in the 
dock before the international community and realize their 
criminal nuclear ambition at any cost. 
  The Japanese authorities, instead of trying to do harm to 
the 
DPRK over its fictitious "nuclear issue", must declare the total 
amount of plutonium kept in hiding, apologize for the criminal 
act and no longer resort to moves for nuclear armament.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- A delegation of the 
South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) led by 
vice-chairman of its Central Committee Hong Chi-yong paid visits 
to Nepal, Cyprus and Syria from March 26 to April 18, the 
Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported. 
  During the visits, the delegation had talks with delegations 
of the Nepal Communist Party (United Marxist-Leninist), the 
Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, the Communist Party of Cyprus 
(AKEL) and the Socialist Party of Cyprus. 
  At the talks the parties highly estimated the activities of 
Hanminjon for independence, democracy and reunification and 
expressed full support and solidarity for its struggle. They 
strongly demanded a prompt end to the tricky row of the U.S. 
imperialists and the traitor Kim Yong-sam over "nuclear 
suspicion" against the North of Korea and the withdrawal of U.S. 
troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea. 
  Hanminjon and the parties published joint statements and 
joint communiques expressing the willingness to support and 
closely cooperate with each other in the accomplishment of the 
cause of global independence and socialism against the 
imperialists' aggressive and belligerent moves and expand and 
strengthen mutual contacts and solidarity. The Hanminjon 
delegation met and conversed with leaders of the afore-said 
parties. 
  They informed each other of their party activities and 
agreed 
on strengthening solidarity. The party leaders voiced support 
for the struggle of Hanminjon and the South Korean people for 
independence, democracy and reunification and denounced the U.S. 
imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam regime of traitors for their 
moves to fascistize the South Korean society, keep the nation 
divided and provoke another war. 
  The Hanminjon delegation enjoyed full support and warm 
welcome everywhere it toured. 
  The Nepal Communist Party (United Marxist-Leninist) and the 
Nepal Workers and Peasants Party organised special lectures, 
local tour and functions in welcome of the delegation, while the 
Arab Socialist Baath Party of Syria hosted a roundtable talk at 
the high institute of political science under the party. 
  The Arab solidarity committee for encouragement to the 
struggle of Hanminjon and the South Korean people comprising six 
international organizations including the International Arab 
Confederation of Arab Trade Unions held a solidarity meeting and 
released a joint statement denouncing the U.S. imperialists and 
the traitor Kim Yong-sam for rendering the situation of the 
Korean peninsula extremely strained, while taking issue with the 
nuclear activities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
It also adopted an appeal to the world peaceloving people, 
international organizations and political parties and 
organizations of all countries calling for the abolition of the 
"National Security Law," the release of political prisoners and 
the sending to the North of Kim In-so, Ham Se-hwan and other 
unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea. 
  Such a meeting was held and a joint statement condemning the 
aggressive and belligerent moves of the U.S. imperialists and 
the traitor Kim Yong-sam was adopted by the solidarity committee 
of political parties and fronts in the Middle East and North 
African area supporting the struggle of Hanminjon and the South 
Korean people comprising 24 political parties and fronts 
including the Palestine Liberation Organization in Damascus, the 
Communist Parties of Syria, Iraq and Jordan and the Socialist 
Progressive Party of Lebanon.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- The basic line of 
building the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] is to establish the 
monolithic ideological system of the party, stresses NODONG 
SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  The article says: 
  The work published by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
on 
May 25, 1967 is of great importance in the efforts of the WPK to 
firmly establish the monolithic ideological system of the party. 
  The historic work expounds that the fundamental principle of 
party building is to firmly establish the party's monolithic 
ideological system as required by the law governing the party 
building of the working class and the reality of party 
ideological work. The work also comprehensively systematizes 
all theoretical and practical questions in establishing this 
system. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il comprehensively 
embodied 
the idea and theory of the great leader's May 25, 1967 work in 
party ideological work and all spheres of the revolution and 
construction so that a turn has been effzcted in the work and 
life of the party members and other working people. 
  The exploits of the Workers' Party of Korea in establishing 
the monolithic ideological system of the party are that all the 
party members and other working people have been firmly prepared 
to be true revolutionaries of chuche type with intense loyalty 
to the party and the leader. 
  The dear leader expounded that the basic requirement and 
criterion of loyalty are to hold the leader in high esteem, 
absolutize the leader's authority, make the leader's 
revolutionary idea and instructions and the party's lines and 
policies one's body and soul and unconditionally carry them out. 
Then he paid deep attention to letting all the party members 
and other working people live on that basis. 
  The greatest exploit of our party in establishing the 
party's 
monolithic ideological system is that it has trained all the 
party members and working people into staunch revolutionaries 
who always share their destiny with the party and defend the 
party and the leader with their lives. 
  Another exploit is that an unbreakable unity around the 
illustrious leader has been achieved. 
  In strengthening the unity of the party, the dear leader 
directed deep attention to inheriting the party's tradition of 
unity and strengthening it. 
  In Korea today, the tradition of unity has been creditably 
carried forward and the singlehearted unity of the leader, the 
party and the masses has been consolidated. 
  Another exploit is that the ideological position of 
Korean-style socialism has been cemented. 
  To cope with the vicious manoeuvres of the imperialists and 
reactionaries in recent years, the dear leader took measures to 
direct greater efforts to the ideological education of the party 
members and other working people than ever before and published 
many famous works, providing a powerful ideological and 
theoretical weapon to solve every problem our own way. 
  It is because our people are resolute ideologically and a 
powerful ideological position has been built in Korea that our 
socialism is making a long drive, not wavering in any storm and 
stress. 
  Impregnable is our socialist ideological position built by 
the dear leader.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- A senior Japanese trade 
ministry official said Thursday Japan will basically respond 
favorably to the latest U.S. request for including five 
additional trade areas in priority sectors under the so-called 
bilateral "framework" talks. 
  U.S. negotiators seem interested in discussing a wide range 
of trade sectors with Japan in line with the framework's three 
priority fields of government procurement, insurance services 
and trade in auto and auto parts, said Hideaki Kumano, vice 
international trade and industry minister, at a news conference. 
  The five areas cited by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor as new priority fields are financial services, sheet 
glass, forestry products, intellectual property rights and 
deregulation for supporting competition policy, according to 
reports in Washington. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is prepared 
to discuss the areas with Washington while working out a 
timetable for talks, Kumano said. 
  Negotiations to establish a new framework on the original 
three sectors were to have been concluded by last February's 
summit between the two countries. But the talks became 
deadlocked when neither Tokyo nor Washington yielded in the 
summit over their definitions of "objective criteria" for 
measuring American access to the Japanese market. 
  Following Thursday's accord to restart the framework talks, 
both parties are expected to soon return to the negotiation 
table on the three priority fields.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
have agreed that the nature of U.S.-proposed objective criteria 
for measuring the openness of Japan's market should be based 
both on quantitative and qualitative standards, according to 
papers of a bilateral agreement revealed Thursday [26 May]. 
  The two countries agreed Tuesday to resume stalled trade 
"framework" talks on the three priority areas -- automobile and 
auto parts, insurance and government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment. 
  Although the two governments agreed not to make public the 
contents of the papers they exchanged Tuesday, sources close to 
the negotiations said that "by making clear the goals in each 
trade area, the separate negotiations will be able to focus more 
on the proposals." 
  The papers showed the two sides also confirmed that 
objective 
criteria be based on both quantitative and qualitative 
standards, and that no numerical targets be set. 
  Japan and the U.S. also clarified the goals in considering 
the criteria for measuring liberalization and the specific 
deregulation measures in the three markets. 
  According to the papers, the goal for the automobile and 
auto 
parts sector is a greater opportunity for entry, while that for 
the government procurement sector is a major increase in foreign 
products and services. For the insurance area, the goal is to 
end obstacles to entry. 
  In future negotiations, the U.S. is expected to ask Japan to 
increase the number of outlets dealing with imported cars and 
car parts, and to take action that will make it easier for 
Japan's automobile dealer networks to sell foreign products, the 
sources said. 
  As for government procurement, the U.S. will probably ask 
for 
improvements in bidding procedures and demand a larger share by 
foreigners by basing objective criteria on the scale of foreign 
product procurement, the sources said. 
  In the insurance sector, they said the U.S. will likely ask 
for an introduction of the broker system and for changes in 
Japan's practice of "keiretsu," or system of interlocking 
shareholding among companies.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa voiced hopes Thursday [26 May] that Japan will be 
awarded the veto powers held by Britain, China, France, Russia 
and the United States if it is admitted as a permanent member on 
a revised UN Security Council [UNSC]. 
  "It is okay for us to join the ranks of the permanent 
security council countries in the future, provided veto powers 
are not abused or exercised serving the ego of the big powers," 
Kakizawa said. 
  Kakizawa made the remarks in response to a question by 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator Setsu Shiga during 
Thursday's session of the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee. 
  The foreign minister apparently aims at closing ranks with 
Germany, another candidate for permanent membership in the key 
UN body, which already declared it will accept a permanent seat 
only if given full veto powers. 
  The current council groups five permanent seats held by the 
major victors of World War II and 10 nonpermanent seats, which 
are rotated every two years among member states of the United 
Nations. 
  With its veto, a permanent member can block any council 
decision. 
  While most of the five have voiced support for Japan's and 
Germany's bids to become permanent members, they have not made 
it clear whether they would be vested with the same rights. 
  Asked by another LDP legislator Wataru Hiraizumi how Japan, 
bound by its pacifist constitution, would respond to calls for 
UN-led collective defense, Kakizawa said, "Chapter 7 of the UN 
Charter stipulates that a special agreement be concluded before 
a country decides to participate in military measures. 
  "Therefore it is not contradictory to participate in UN 
operations on a scope the constitution allows for," Kakizawa 
said, noting that Japan has accepted the whole of the UN Charter. 
  Chapter 7 stipulates that member countries in case of 
breaches of peace and acts of aggression make available forces, 
assistance and facilities "in accordance with a special 
agreement or agreements." 
  Countries are subject to ratification "in accord with their 
respective constitutional processes," the charter says. 
  In a related comment, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Japan 
"must deepen the ongoing thorough discussion" before deciding on 
its response if the UN forces are set up.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- The Foreign Ministry plans 
to set up a panel to study possible topics for the agenda of the 
next global trade negotiations that will succeed the Uruguay 
Round of multilateral trade talks, ministry sources said 
Wednesday [25 May]. 
  The sources said the planned panel indicates Japan's desire 
to take the initiative in launching the next round of global 
trade negotiations. 
  The study group, led by the ministry's Economic Affairs 
Bureau, will be focused on possible agenda subjects for the next 
round, such as the relationship between trade and environment, 
trade and labor, and trade and investment, as well as 
regionalism. 
  It will work out draft proposals on these themes by November 
and announce them at meetings of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO), which is scheduled to take form in January to replace the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
  The draft proposals will reflect opinions from academics and 
private-sector firms as well. 
  Just days after the Uruguay Round trade pact was signed in 
April, major powers began shifting to the next round of trade 
talks.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 0000 GMT on 22 May, in its "Sunday Discussion" 
program, carries a live 75-minute roundtable discussion. 
Present at the discussion are Koji Kakizawa, foreign minister; 
Atsushi Kanda, Defense Agency director general; Taku Yamasaki, 
deputy secretary general of the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP]; Kosuke Uehara, a member of the opposition Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]; Hajime Funada, standing 
secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; Chikara Sakaguchi, 
chairmen of Komeito's Policy Research Council; Shoichi Ide, 
chairman of the Sakigake [Harbinger Party] General Council; 
Hiroshi Kikunami, chairman of the Japan Communist Party [JCP] 
Policy Committee. The discussion is moderated by NHK 
commentator Takashi Yamamoto. 
  Yamamoto begins the discussion by raising the issue of the 
DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons for discussion 
and then asks Kakizawa to comment. Kakizawa states: "The 
international community has been making efforts to clear up 
suspicions about North Korea's development of nuclear arms. The 
United States and other nations, including China, have continued 
to urge North Korea through dialogue to work to allay 
international concern. I believe the effort by the United 
States and other nations are paying off little by little while 
making North Korea understand." Kakizawa goes on to say: "The 
international community has been concerned about North Korea's 
unilateral replacement of fuel rods at an experimental nuclear 
reactor. According to a news release issued this morning by the 
IAEA, however, North Korea has notified the IAEA of its 
intention to allow IAEA inspectors to check the replacement of 
the fuel rods and the experimental nuclear reactor in the 
future. I hope that North Korea will move that way in the 
future." Asked by Yamamoto to comment about the prospect of the 
United States and North Korea resuming the third round of their 
high-level talks, Kakizawa cites remarks by U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Gallucci and says: "The third round of the 
high-level talks will be held between the two countries." Asked 
by Yamamoto to comment on the reports that North Korea intends 
to buy time instead of seeking an early settlement to the 
nuclear dispute, Kakizawa points to North Korea's past 
capriciousness in dealing with the nuclear issue and notes that 
"progress is being made little by little in the dialogue." 
  Turning to the Hata Cabinet's handling of Japan's security 
policy and the nuclear issue, Yamamoto asks panelists to 
comment. Yamazaki states: "The issue of North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear arms is a vital issue to Japan 
and Japan needs to vigorously deal with the issue. I believe 
that Japan needs to prepare itself to properly deal with 
economic sanctions against North Korea once they are imposed. 
In this connection, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai has stated 
the government has prepared for emergency legislation. However, 
my understanding is that the government has not yet prepared for 
the emergency legislation at all," adding that Japan should make 
diplomatic effort to persuade the DPRK. 
  Uehara says: "The SDPJ takes the view that the Korean 
peninsula should remain free of nuclear. The SDPJ also has been 
concerned about North Korea's suspected development of nuclear 
arms. Our party has long advocated settling the nuclear issue 
through dialogue since it was in the Hosokawa government as a 
coalition partner." 
  Noting the importance of dialogue, Funada states: "A set of 
policy agreements reached among the coalition partners 
stipulates that Japan should act within the framework of the 
United Nations, the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and the Japanese 
Constitution if the dialogue does not go well as hoped." 
  Kikunami notes that "the JCP has harshly condemned North 
Korea for waging international terrorism" and states: "What is 
important for now is not to seek economic sanctions, but to seek 
a political and peaceful settlement to the nuclear issue." 
  Discussing the government's handling of the issue of the 
DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons, Kakizawa 
states: "Japan and North Korea have so far held eight rounds of 
normalization talks; at these talks, Japan has urged North Korea 
to allay the international community's concerns over its nuclear 
program. Regrettably, the Japan-North Korea normalization talks 
have remained stalled since the talks were broken off over the 
Yi Un-hae issue [the DPRK's alleged abduction of a Japanese 
woman] in November 1992. The government has told North Korea 
that Japan is willing to resume the normalization talks. Japan 
has notified North Korea of its requests through diplomatic 
contacts in Beijing and the United Nations although I cannot go 
into details about the requests. In this way, Japan, for its 
part, has worked to settle the nuclear issue." 
  Yamamoto raises the question of reinterpreting the 
Constitution to allow Japan to exercise the collective 
self-defense right and then asks panelists to comment. Kakizawa 
states: "The situation surrounding Japan's security has become 
very grim and the international situation surrounding Japan's 
security also has changed. Looking at the results of a recent 
poll, many people are concerned about this situation and speak 
of the need to debate how Japan should deal with it. I have 
proposed that national debates be held on the relationship 
between the Constitution and Japan's exercise of the collective 
self-defense right." Kanda states: "The government is going so 
far as to reinterpret the Constitution to allow Japan to 
exercise the collective self-defense right." Uehara notes the 
SDPJ's effort to alter its long-established security policy and 
says: "The SDPJ has to honor the policy agreements reached 
between the SDPJ and other coalition partners." 
  Turning to economic sanctions against the DPRK, Yamamoto 
asks 
Funada to comment on what Japan should do if the economic 
sanctions are imposed. Funada states: "In principle, the issue 
of North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons should 
be settled through dialogue. Various actions should be taken 
against North Korea if the dialogue does not go as hoped. The 
question can be raised about how Japan should act within the 
framework of the United Nations. If the United Nations makes 
various recommendations and adopts various resolutions, Japan 
should of course deal with them within the framework of the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, the Japan-South Korea Friendship 
Treaty, and the Constitution. What I have advocated is that 
Japan should deal properly with the economic sanctions within 
constitutionally permitted limits." 
  Noting that "it remains uncertain whether China will vote 
for 
the economic sanctions or not," Sakaguchi states, "Komeito hopes 
that the United Nations will decide to slap on the economic 
sanctions if the nuclear issue is not satisfactorily resolved. 
But the United Nations may fail to slap the economic sanctions 
against North Korea and Japan will have to think of what it 
should do if the United Nations fails to slap the economic 
sanctions." 
  Discussing the possibility of a naval blockade against the 
DPRK under the economic sanctions, Yamamoto asks panelists to 
comment on how Japan should deal with the naval blockade. Kanda 
says: "If the naval blockade is imposed, the Defense Agency 
will deal with it in consultation with the Foreign Ministry," 
adding that he hopes such a naval blockade will not be imposed. 
  Kakizawa states: "Mr. Yamazaki said just a while ago that 
the government is not prepared for the naval blockade. I think 
that various ministries and agencies have been asked to study 
how Japan should deal with the naval blockade. Now, the 
international community is working to settle the nuclear issue 
through dialogue. In view of moves taking place yesterday and 
today, there is a possibility that the nuclear issue could move 
in a good direction. Therefore, I would like to refrain from 
openly discussing what Japan should do if the dialogue does not 
go well." 
  Ide says: "The nuclear issue should be settled through 
dialogue. With regard to economic sanctions, North Korea has 
been isolated economically from the rest of the world and I 
believe that economic sanctions will not yield the desired 
results. Economic sanctions will not produce the desired effect 
if China refuses to go along with them since it shares a border 
with North Korea." 
  Kikunami reiterates the importance of dialogue and notes 
that 
the "set of policy agreements reached among the coalition 
partners aims to let Japan join the economic sanctions." Citing 
a congressional report in the United States, Kikunami says: 
"The United States plans to use nuclear weapons, impose a naval 
blockade against North Korea, and launch air strikes on North 
Korea's nuclear facilities." 
  Kakizawa notes that the United States and European nations 
are deeply concerned about the DPRK's suspected development of 
nuclear weapons, adding that "according to a poll, a majority of 
Japanese are greatly worried about North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear weapons." Kakizawa also stresses that 
"the government has been working for a peaceful settlement to 
the nuclear issue instead of whipping up a sense of crisis among 
the people." 
  Continuing the discussion of how Japan should deal with 
economic sanctions against the DPRK, Sakaguchi notes the 
importance of defending the security and peace in Asia and the 
Far East including Japan and states: "It is important and a 
matter of course to seek a settlement to the nuclear issue 
through dialogue." 
  Yamazaki states: "The diplomatic efforts have been left to 
the United States and North Korea, and I believe that this is 
not desirable. I think that Japanese politics should move to 
settle the nuclear issue." 
  Kakizawa says: "Japan has continued diplomatic contacts with 
North Korea in Beijing and the United Nations. North Korea's 
basic policy is that it is not in a position to discuss the 
nuclear issue with Japan. As you well know, North Korea has 
been attaching great importance to dialogue with the United 
States. North Korea has been moving to link the nuclear issue 
to normalizing relations with the United States. Japan has 
maintained close contacts with the United States and South 
Korea. With regard to the question of whether Japan should 
participate in the U.S.-North Korea talks, Japan has to make a 
realistic judgment. As Mr. Yamazaki indicated a while ago, 
Japan thinks that it has to do something. However, I believe 
that it is proper for Japan to take a wait-and-see attitude." 
  Discussing the question of putting economic sanctions on the 
DPRK, Kikunami states: "The JCP is opposed to North Korea 
possessing any nuclear weapons. The JCP is opposed to it from 
the standpoint of keeping the world free of nuclear weapons. To 
speak of the U.S. and Japanese Government positions, the United 
States presently possesses 10,000 nuclear warheads and it will 
retain them forever. Therefore, the United States has asserted 
that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] should be 
extended indefinitely. The United States thinks that there is no 
problem with its nuclear weapons, but it does not tolerate other 
nations possessing them. The United States has asserted that if 
one nation is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, then it 
will face economic sanctions. This is illegal." 
  In response, Kakizawa notes that "India and other nations 
have indicated problems with the NPT" and says: "In reality, 
many other nations are greatly concerned about nuclear 
proliferation. Therefore, Japan believes that the NPT should be 
in place as written." 
  Asked by Yamamoto to comment on the NPT, Yamazaki says: "If 
North Korea has nuclear weapons, I would oppose extending the 
NPT indefinitely. At present, however, I favor extending the 
NPT indefinitely. If one of Japan's neighboring nations becomes 
a nuclear power, causing the fear of global nuclear 
proliferation, Japan should not agree to extend the NPT 
indefinitely." 
  Kakizawa responds: "If North Korea possesses nuclear 
weapons, it would bring a major change to the current security 
framework for Northeast Asia. I think that such a major change 
will not be in the interest of Japan's security. Therefore, 
Japan has worked hard for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. 
Japan has announced to the world that it will honor the NPT. 
The government has no intention of altering that policy." 
  Turning to the subject to Japan's bid for a permanent 
membership in the UN Security Council [UNSC], Yamamoto says 
Prime Minister Hata is vigorously pushing for Japan's bid and 
then asks the panelists to comment. Kakizawa discusses the 
reform of the United Nations including the UNSC and says: "The 
mood is growing that Japan's affiliation with the UNSC as a 
permanent member will serve to strengthen the UN's functions. 
With that mood in mind, Prime Minister Hata has said Japan 
intends to contribute to the international community within the 
constitutionally permitted framework as a permanent UNSC member." 
  Kanda states: "The Hata government intends to make Japan 
join the UNSC as a permanent member and I personally support 
this intention." 
  Funada says: "In principle, the ruling coalition parties 
support Japan's affiliation with the UNSC as a permanent member." 
  Yamazaki says: "In principle, the LDP supports Japan 
becoming a permanent UNSC member," adding that it is necessary 
to hold national and political debates on the question of 
Japan's affiliation with the UNSC as a permanent member. 
Yamazaki also stresses: "Japan should have a decisive say in 
the UNSC." 
  Sakaguchi says: "Domestic debates should be held before 
Japan joins the UNSC as a permanent member. I think that Japan 
should become a permanent UNSC member since it is the second 
largest financial contributor to the United Nations, following 
the United States." 
  Uehara says: "I do not oppose Japan joining the UNSC as a 
permanent member if conditions are created whereby a way opens 
for Japan to become a permanent UNSC member." 
  Ide states: "Japan should not openly seek to become a 
permanent UNSC member because Japan has yet to decide what it 
can do after joining it. Although the United States and Britain 
support Japan becoming a permanent member, that does not mean 
that they are asking Japan to take that status." 
  Kikunami states: "The JCP opposes Japan becoming a permanent 
UNSC member from a constitutional standpoint." Explaining 
reasons for the JCP's opposition, Kikunami cites the possibility 
of Japan getting involved in UN-sanctioned military actions. 
  Commenting on Kikunami's statement, Kakizawa says: "Japan 
will participate only in PKO [UN peacekeeping operations]. Even 
if the United Nations creates a force in accordance with Article 
42, the member nations cannot participate in the force unless 
they conclude an agreement with the United Nations in accordance 
with Article 43," adding that the United Nations does not intend 
to create the force immediately. 
  Turning to the political situation, Yamamoto notes remarks 
by 
SDPJ Secretary General Kubo that if the Hata Cabinet resigns en 
masse after the 1994 budget bill is passed in the Diet, the SDPJ 
will aim to return to the ruling coalition and form a new 
coalition government. Yamamoto asks panelists to comment on 
Kubo's remarks. Yamazaki says: "Mr. Kubo has made important 
remarks." 
  Uehara states: "Mr. Kubo's remarks are important. I 
believe that the SDPJ will debate his remarks. If the ruling 
coalition parties value the SDPJ, they should listen to what the 
SDPJ has advocated." 
  At 0115 GMT, Yamamoto concludes the roundtable discussion 
after thanking the panelists.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25, SPA -- Custodian of the two holy 
mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz has sent a message to the 
Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. The message was handed 
over by Hisham Nazir, the Saudi minister of petroleum and 
mineral resources, who was received by the prime minister at the 
parliament headquarters here on Tuesday. 
  Following the meeting, Nazir told the SPA that he also 
conveyed to Mr Hata the interest of King Fahd for promotion of 
the bilateral relations between the two countries in various 
fields. 
  Nazir also expressed satisfaction over the four-decade 
friendship ties between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Japan as 
the Kingdom is regarded as the biggest oil exporter to Japan 
which imports about 25 percent of its oil needs from the kingdom 
which is, on turn, regarded among the biggest importers of the 
Japanese products. 
  Minister Nazir said the kingdom is looking forwards for 
setting up more economic joint ventures with Japanese partners 
including a joint petroleum project for refining and 
distribution of the Saudi Aramco's oil products in Japan's 
markets. 
  He said the Japanese prime minister and other concerned 
ministers with which he met, have expressed support for the 
establishment of the joint venture which will be run by the 
Saudi Aramco and Japanese oil companies inside Japan. 
  Nazir also met on Tuesday with the Minister of Foreign Trade 
and Industry Eijiro Hata and the meeting was attended by the 
Saudi Ambassador to Japan Fawzi Shobokshi, the chairman of Saudi 
Aramco 'Ali al-Na'imi and members of the delegation accompanying 
him.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan has extended a total 
of 15.25 million dollars to finance the Palestinians' 
administrative expenses in the Gaza strip and Jericho, a senior 
Foreign Ministry official said Thursday [26 May]. 
  The assistance is part of the 200 million dollars Japan 
pledged last October to provide over two years to finance 
reconstruction of the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza 
strip, the official said. 
  Of the total, the government disbursed 3.5 million dollars 
to 
a World Bank fund dubbed the "Holst Fund," which aims at 
financing administrative expenses, he said. 
  The fund is named after the late Norwegian Foreign Minister 
Johan Holst, who played an instrumental role in brokering the 
agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization (PLO) last September for limited Palestinian 
self-rule in the occupied territories. 
  The fund has so far collected 25 million dollars, but it is 
expected to fall short by 20 million to 25 million dollars in 
June because of the lack of administrative systems such as tax 
collection, the official said. 
  On a yearlong basis, the shortage is expected to amount to 
some 120 million to 130 million dollars, he said. 
  Tokyo also disbursed 10 million dollars through the United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP) to provide houses for 800 
families of Palestinian police and 250,000 dollars to purchase 
computers for the police, he said. 
  Another 1.5 million dollars was extended to the Palestinian 
Economic Committee for Development and Reconstruction (PECDR), 
he added.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan and France agreed 
Thursday [26 May] to hold talks to exempt construction materials 
being traded between the two nations from inspection, Japanese 
Government officials said. 
  Japan's Construction Ministry and France's Housing Ministry 
will confirm which materials will be eligible for exemption by 
the end of October. 
  The plan, which is slated to come into effect in November, 
will also cover construction methods. 
  France will be the first country to agree to have talks on 
such a reciprocal requirement with Japan, though Japan hopes to 
make a similar agreement with the United States and with Canada, 
they said. 
  An examination is required for construction materials and 
methods by each government for safety measures against strength 
or fire. But each country has its own requirement. 
  For instance, a certain French construction material that 
meets French standards has to be checked again in Japan when it 
is imported here.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea on 
Thursday [26 May] agreed to formulate a joint program to assist 
small and medium-sized South Korean companies. 
  The accord was reached when Japanese International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata met with his South Korean 
counterpart, Kim Chol-su, in Tokyo to attend the Japan-South 
Korean meeting of trade ministers. 
  During the one-day, one-hour meeting, Hata said Tokyo will 
maximize its efforts to expand economic relations through 
further industrial cooperation with South Korean companies. 
  The joint program is aimed at facilitating industrial 
restructuring in South Korea, especially among small companies, 
in an effort to narrow bilateral trade imbalance in favor of 
Japan, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) told a news conference. 
  The program calls for regular studies of ways to encourage 
technological transfer from Japan to South Korea, promotion of 
human exchanges to reinforce technological foundations at small 
South Korean companies, and expanded marketing support of such 
companies by Japanese organs such as the Japan External Trade 
Organization. 
  Japanese businesses will also be encouraged to step up 
direct 
investment in South Korea, the MITI official said. 
  To that end, Japan will send study missions to Seoul and 
other South Korean cities, while South Korean delegations will 
visit Japan to lure prospective Japanese investors, the official 
said. 
  The two countries will select small South Korean firms in 
"supporting" industries such as household electrical appliances 
parts, electronic components, general machine parts and auto 
parts. 
  Selected companies will serve as model firms under the 
program, the MITI official said. 
  Hata and Kim also discussed how to upgrade South Korea's 
investment conditions for foreign companies. 
  Specifically, the MITI chief asked Seoul to remove measures 
that hamper smooth foreign investment, including a rule 
restricting activity of foreign trading houses. 
  Kim replied Seoul will study the request positively, the 
MITI 
official said. 
  Japan also will send its first investment study mission to 
South Korea this fall, the official said. 
  Hata and Kim agreed to launch a joint working bilateral 
panel 
to enhance mutual cooperation in multimedia and other 
information-related areas. 
  The joint program is in line with proposals made last March 
during the summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam. 
  Thursday's meeting was the third of its kind to be held 
between Japanese and South Korean trade ministers, following 
those in Tokyo in 1992 and in Seoul last year. 
  Kim Chul-su arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day for a 
two-day 
stay, the first South Korean cabinet minister to visit Japan 
since the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was formed 
in late April.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan will suspend imports 
of long-grain rice from Thailand, which has accounted for 
one-third of all imported rice since the government began 
importing the grain after the worst rice harvest last year in 
the postwar period, government officials said Thursday [26 May]. 
Long-grain Thai rice imports reached 570,000 tons, against 
total rice imports of 1.7 million tons. 
  The Food Agency made the decision as contracts on purchases 
of Thai rice expired in April, the officials said. They also 
cited anticipated boarding troubles of the Thai rice during the 
May-June period, the usual rainy season in Thailand. But some 
experts say the real reason for the decision is sluggish sales 
of long-grain rice, unpopular among Japanese who favor short- or 
medium-grain rice. 
  The agency, which plans to stop sales of Thai rice to 
wholesalers at the end of August, has signed contracts to buy 
about 400,000 tons of short- or medium-grain rice from China, 
the United States and Australia as of Wednesday, the officials 
said. The agency plans to purchase an additional 750,000 tons 
of rice with expectations of another off-crop season. 
  Sales of Chinese, U.S. and Australian rice to domestic 
wholesalers will begin in September and October, according to 
the officials.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- A senior leader of the 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) on Thursday [26 May] called on 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to resign once the state budget 
clears the Diet and before a no-confidence vote so as to fashion 
a new coalition government. 
  "I believe the coalition's continued hold on power is the 
demands of the times," SDP secretary general Wataru Kubo told 
reporters after meeting Hata at the premier's official residence. 
  "I told (Hata) a voluntary resignation is one option if he 
wishes to form a new coalition government and solidify his power 
base," he said. 
  Hata replied that he will strive to fulfill his duties as 
head of government, Kubo said. 
  Hata agreed to meet SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama, leader 
of 
the second largest opposition party, whenever necessary, to 
compare notes on issues of mutual concern, Kubo said. 
  Kubo also said Saturday that the Hata cabinet should resign 
as soon as the fiscal 1994 budget wins Diet approval, and before 
the opposition camp submits a no-confidence motion against the 
government. 
  Kubo, the No. 2 man in the SDP, said this to Japanese 
reporters traveling with him on his trip to China, indicating 
the SDP may move to bury the hatchet with its former coalition 
partners and join a new ruling union. 
  Questioned Thursday about the possibility of the SDP's 
return 
to the coalition, Kubo said he did not discuss the matter with 
the premier in their meeting. 
  In late April, the SDP broke away from the coalition in 
protest against the formation by other coalition parties of a 
new parliamentary group excluding the SDP, the alliance's 
largest contingent. 
  As a result, Hata was forced to lead the first minority 
government since 1955. 
  The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the largest opposition 
group, has threatened to introduce a motion of no-confidence 
against the Hata cabinet after passage of the budget. 
  Defeat on such a motion would leave the premier with a 
choice 
of either resigning or calling a snap general election. 
  If Hata quit after a no-confidence vote, Kubo said, he would 
have no other choice but to hand the reins of government over to 
the LDP. 
  On the other hand, he said, if a snap poll is called after 
Diet passage of the budget, it should be contested under the 
current multiseat electoral system, which is to be replaced by a 
new system combining single-seat constituencies with 
proportional representation. 
  Hata contends that the next general election must be called 
under the new system, which, however, requires the enactment of 
a bill to redraw the electoral map. To hold an election under 
the old system would be to abandon political reform, he says. 
  Kubo visited Hata to relay the reply of Chinese President 
and 
Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin to the premier's 
personal letter he handed over when he met the Chinese leader.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Nearly 60 percent of 
respondents do not want an early dissolution of the House of 
Representatives for a snap general election, according to an 
opinion survey released by a major newspaper Thursday [26 May]. 
  The poll, conducted nationwide by the YOMIURI SHIMBUN on 
Saturday and Sunday, showed 59 percent of respondents said there 
is no need to rush to dissolve the lower house to call a general 
election, while 31 percent wanted a lower house dissolution for 
a general election immediately after passage of the fiscal 1994 
state budget. 
  Asked which party they will vote for if a general election 
is 
held, 29 percent said they will vote for the LDP [Liberal 
democratic Party], 13 percent cited Shinseito, 8 percent 
preferred the Social Democratic Party [SDPJ], 5 percent 
supported New Party Sakigake and the Japan New Party [JNP], 
while 3 percent said they will vote for Komeito. 
  The YOMIURI found a moderate recovery in the support rate 
for 
the LDP, which was 31 percent in June last year, while support 
for both the SDPJ and the JNP dropped by about half compared 
with figures registered last June. 
  The respondents were equally divided over the issue of 
whether the next general election should be held under the 
current multiseat constituency system or the new election system 
approved under the package of political reform passed by the 
Diet. A new electoral map for single-seat constituencies has 
not been drawn up yet. 
  The survey covered 2,091 people aged 20 and older.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- A private panel on political 
reform pressed a demand Thursday [26 May] that the next general 
election be contested under a new electoral system in order to 
cap years of reform efforts. 
  "We strongly demand that the next election for the House of 
Representatives be held under the new system after quick 
enactment of a bill that demarcates the boundaries of a new 
electoral map," the Committee for the Promotion of Political 
Reform said in a statement. 
  The group, made up of Japanese industry, labor and media 
leaders, took a swipe at calls among the Liberal Democratic 
Party and Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the two key 
opposition forces, for a general poll under the current 
multiseat system. 
  "I cannot understand at all moves to turn back the clock to 
the past," Kenzo Uchida, acting chairman of the panel, said at a 
news conference. 
  The Diet in January legislated a package of electoral reform 
bills replacing the current multiseat system in the lower house 
with a mix of single-seat electorates and proportional 
representation. 
  An independent panel of experts is currently splitting up 
the 
nation's multiseat constituencies into 300 single-seat districts. 
  The private panel also called for additional efforts to 
revamp the nation's political structure and carry out sweeping 
administrative reform centering on deregulation and 
decentralization of power. 
  To win back public trust in politics, the group said, the 
establishment of political ethics and eradication of political 
corruption are needed.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- The ruling coalition agreed 
Thursday [26 May] to opposition demands that former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's former aide be summoned to the Diet 
to testify on Hosokawa's controversial financial dealings that 
forced him to resign last month. 
  The coalition announced at an agenda-setting meeting for the 
House of Representatives Budget Committee that it agrees to the 
committee hearing testimony by Masatoshi Miyama after the state 
budget for fiscal 1994 passes the lower house. 
  Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and other 
opposition parties plan to step up pressure on the government 
for testimony from Hosokawa himself, which they view as a step 
to his resignation as a Diet member, opposition sources said. 
  Hosokawa stepped down last month because of the row over his 
loan from a scandal-tainted company and alleged involvement in 
the purchase of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. 
(NTT). 
  The dispute paralyzed Diet proceedings, preventing the 
budget 
from being passed. 
  Hosokawa has said the 100 million yen loan from Sagawa 
Kyubin 
Co., and the purchase of shares in NTT were both handled by 
Miyama. The former premier insisted the shares were bought by 
his late father-in-law. 
  Hosokawa said the financial deals were above board. He said 
he has paid back the loan from Sagawa, and denied he was 
personally involved in the stock purchase. But documents he 
presented to the Diet on the Sagawa loan were found to contain 
apparent inaccuracies. 
  In addition, a financial consultant who had helped Hosokawa 
said in the Diet that the former premier bought the NTT shares 
himself.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- A suprapartisan group of 
about 90 legislators announced Thursday [26 May] they will 
launch a signature drive to drum up parliamentary support for 
the completion of political reform efforts. 
  "We are determined to implement the next elections for the 
House of Representatives under a new system," said Yuji 
Tsushima, a lower house member of the primary opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), in reading the group's statement. 
  The move comes in response to unabated calls from the LDP 
and 
the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party [of Japan] 
(SDP) [SDPJ] for a general poll under the current multiseat 
electoral system after passage of the fiscal 1994 national 
budget. 
  At a news conference, Tsushima, chief initiator of the 
signature drive, lashed such calls, saying, "it is never 
pardonable to try to see a general election held under the 
multiseat system." 
  The legislators aim to collect signatures from the majority 
of the 511 lower house members by June 10 as the first step to 
cap years of political reform efforts, he said. 
  Their action follows a demand earlier Thursday from a 
private 
panel on reform that the next general election be held under the 
new system combining single-seat constituencies with 
proportional representation. 
  The committee for the promotion of political reform, formed 
in 1992 by industry, labor and media leaders, has supported 
lawmakers of all parties who seek to revamp the nation's 
political system and eradicate corruption in public life. 
  In January the Diet legislated a package of electoral reform 
bills replacing the current multiseat system in the lower house 
with a combination of 300 single-seat voting districts and 200 
in proportional representation. 
  An independent panel of experts is currently splitting up 
the 
nation's multiseat constituencies into single-seat electorates 
and is likely to decide shortly on guidelines for the 
demarcation. 
  However, the LDP has threatened to submit a no-confidence 
motion against the cabinet of prime minister Tsutomu Hata after 
the Diet approves the budget, and the SDPJ has shown interest in 
jumping on the bandwagon. 
  The LDP holds 206 seats in the lower house and the SDPJ has 
74 against 178 in Hata's coalition, the first minority goverment 
in 39 years. 
  The SDPJ's Masao Sakon hinted he and other party lawmakers 
who support the signature drive may have to leave the SDPJ if 
its leadership moves to cooperate in bringing down the Hata 
government in a no-confidence vote. 
  "If such a situation arises, we may have to make a certain 
decision," he said. 
  Tsushima also explained their move stems from their 
political 
morality, noting that nearly all Diet members were elected after 
vowing to achieve political reform

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- The No. 2 opposition party, 
the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], adopted a 
draft action plan Thursday [26 May] urging the cabinet of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata to resign en masse and to establish a new 
coalition government. 
  The draft follows recent remarks by SDPJ Secretary General 
Wataru Kubo, who urged the Hata cabinet to resign immediately 
after the fiscal 1994 state budget bills pass the Diet and 
hinted that the party may rejoin the ruling coalition if the 
premier accepts his request. 
  The party will officially approve the action plan at its 
decision-making central committee session on May 28 and 29, the 
officials said. 
  The action program said if Hata does not step down, and the 
administration's policies deviate from the spirit of the 
war-renouncing constitution and go against the people's will, 
the SDPJ will deal with the situation through a "serious 
decision," hinting at tabling a no-confidence motion against the 
cabinet. 
  Defeat on such a motion would leave the premier with a 
choice 
of either resigning or calling a snap general election for the 
House of Representatives. 
  The plan rules out an alliance with the largest opposition 
party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), saying the SDPJ will 
not take any actions that may enable the LDP to regain power. 
  The action program aims at forming a new coalition led by 
"social democratic and liberal" forces. 
  The policy plan was approved by the party's leadership body, 
the central executive committee on Thursday. 
  The action program cites "restoration of faith and trust 
among parties" as conditions for the SDPJ to return to the 
ruling coalition. The SDPJ quit the coalition late last month 
in protest against the establishment of a large parliamentary 
group excluding it. 
  The passage refers to a feud over the new Diet bloc created 
by the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party and 
the Democratic Socialist Party. 
  The new bloc angered the SDPJ and resulted in their 
secession 
from the coalition, leaving Hata with Japan's first minority 
government in four decades. 
  The action plan also says Japan could join United Nations 
forces in a future disarmed world, on condition that they stand 
independent from control of other nations. 
  Regarding elections, the plan says the next general election 
should be held under a new electoral system, a combination of 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, that 
became law in January. 
  However, the plan does not rule out the possibility that the 
current multiseat constituency system could be maintained for 
the next election. 
  The new system requires the enactment of a bill to redraw 
the 
electoral map, toward which the SDPJ will do its best, the 
action program said.

  [Text] At its executive committee meeting this morning, 
Sakigake [Harbinger Party] formally decided to accept members of 
the "Minshu no Kaze [Wind of Democracy]" group, which consists 
of four Diet members who left the Japan New Party [JNP] on 20 
May, as new members of the parliamentary grouping it leads. 
  Sakigake has already formed a Diet group with Seiun, also 
made up of three JNP defectors. The "Minshu no Kaze" members 
will also be admitted to this group. Sakigake will register the 
new group shortly. 
  In view of this, Sakigake will also allow "Minshu no Kaze" 
members to participate in its policy study group with the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. 
  At today's executive meeting, Sakigake Secretary General 
Hiroyuki Sonoda also reported on SDPJ Secretary Wataru Kubo's 
recent statement on his intention to participate in molding the 
political regime, including cooperation with the incumbent 
ruling coalition parties, on condition that the Hata cabinet 
resigns en masse. He reported that Kubo said he had merely 
wanted to turn the tide because people tend to think of the SDPJ 
as attempting to cooperate with the Liberal Democratic Party, or 
as favoring the dissolution of the Diet and holding lower house 
elections under the present medium-sized constituency system. 
Sonoda said Kubo explained that he was not actively thinking of 
returning to the coalition.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- The Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Fisheries plans to revamp the country's outmoded 
food control system to reduce the government's grip on the rice 
market, ministry sources said Wednesday [25 May]. 
  The ministry will submit a bill to revise the Food Control 
Law this fall to the extraordinary session of the Diet. It will 
propose introducing more market forces to production and 
marketing of rice, the country's staple grain. 
  Although the key framework of the system will be left 
unchanged, the new law will allow farmers to grow as much rice 
as they like, oblige the government to stockpile rice in case of 
emergency and ease regulations on rice marketing. 
  The sources said the ministry's steps were forced by a 
rapidly changing situation in Japan's rice market in recent 
years. 
  The Uruguay Round trade pact, completed last December, 
requires Japan to buy foreign rice. The country also suffered 
its worst rice harvest in the postwar era last year due to poor 
weather, prompting consumers to panic in search of domestic 
grains. 
  Furthermore, more rice has been traded on the black market, 
out of government-approved channels. 
  The Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory body to 
the prime minister, will draw up an interim report on the future 
of Japan's agriculture and food control system in late July for 
the government to formulate a revised Food Control Law. 
  In the revision, the second since the law was enacted in 
1942, rice growers will be allowed the option of not reducing 
their rice-planting acreage. 
  Currently, farmers are forced to cut their rice acreage 
every 
year in line with the government's annual plan for rice supplies. 
  The revised law would call for state stockpiling of rice, in 
order to respond to public criticism that scant government 
reserves bear part of the blame for the recent rice panic. 
  The details of the planned stockpiling have yet to be worked 
out, but the sources said the ministry is considering increasing 
state stockpile to 650,000 tons by October 1995 and 1.3 million 
tons by October 1996. 
  At the end of October last year, only 230,000 tons were 
reserved in government warehouses. The Japanese rice year 
starts in November and ends in October. 
  The sources said the overhaul will take into account calls 
from rice growers to allow them to sell their products freely, 
citing possible difficulties in stable supplies. 
  Instead, the ministry plans to boost "jishu ryutsu mai" 
rice, 
which rice growers can sell directly to the market, not through 
the government. 
  Also being considered is a more flexible licensing to 
would-be rice wholesalers and retailers, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- The Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC) upheld its own previous finding Thursday [26 May] in a 
price-rigging case involving Toshiba Chemical Corp. and ruled 
again that the firm violated the Antimonopoly Law. 
  The FTC said Toshiba Chemical and seven other companies, 
which dominate the domestic market for phenolic copper-coated 
paper laminates, formed a price cartel in June 1987 to boost 
prices. 
  The ruling was identical to one the antimonopoly watchdog 
handed down in 1992, which the Tokyo High Court nullified in 
February this year. 
  The court ordered the commission to reexamine the case, 
saying the FTC decision was unfair because an investigator in 
the original cartel probe was later named one of the FTC's five 
members who ruled on the case. 
  Hitachi Chemical Co. and six other makers abided by an FTC 
order in June 1989 to halt the unfair practice, but Toshiba 
refused to comply and sought a legal judgment from the FTC. 
  After a series of public hearings, the FTC concluded in 
September 1992 that the firm violated the Antimonopoly Law. 
  Toshiba Chemical, dissatisfied with the decision, filed a 
suit against the commission.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan's trade and industry 
minister on Thursday [26 May] urged business leaders to increase 
employment of female college graduates, who are having great 
difficulty finding jobs in the prolonged recession, government 
officials said. 
  Eijiro Hata, head of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI), made the request in a meeting with leaders of 
the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren). 
  Noting that Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has expressed 
concern 
over the lack of job opportunities for female graduates, Hata 
said his ministry seeks help from the Nikkeiren, the officials 
said. 
  They quoted Takeshi Nagano, president of Nikkeiren, as 
saying 
that it is an important task and the organization will act in 
line with MITI's request. 
  Nagano, however, offered no concrete proposals on the female 
employment issue, according to the officials. 
  The current economic downturn, which started about two years 
ago, has prompted Japanese corporations to streamline their 
businesses and to cut down on employment. 
  Surveys show that the number of job openings for new college 
graduates, both male and female, fell about 20 percent this 
spring and will further drop by around 25 percent in the spring 
of 1995 -- about a 40 percent fall from the latest peak in 1992. 
  Nearly 13 percent of female students graduating from 
colleges, universities and vocational schools in March had not 
found jobs as of the end of February, a Labor Ministry survey 
found. 
  A separate Labor Ministry survey last December found that 
more than 52 percent of the 1,000 or so firms responding said 
they were employing fewer women because more male students were 
seeking work. 
  More than 30 percent of the companies said they were hiring 
fewer female graduates from two-year colleges and high schools 
because "women are working longer."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan's household 
expenditures posted the second straight yearly decline in fiscal 
1993, which ended March 31, reflecting continued weak consumer 
spending, the Management and Coordination Agency reported 
Thursday [26 May]. 
  The average Japanese family of 3.48 people spent 335,379 yen 
monthly in the year, down 0.6 percent from the previous year, 
following a 0.5 percent fall in the previous year, the agency 
said. 
  "Families spent less on durable goods, discouraged by lower 
income resulting from the recession," an official at the agency 
said. 
  Families of salaried workers spent 1.3 percent less, while 
families of nonsalaried workers registered a 0.7 percent 
spending increase, the official said. 
  In March alone, household spending shrank a real 4.3 percent 
to an average 353,908 yen for the second consecutive month after 
four months of year-on-year gains, it said.

  [Text] Berlin, May 25 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] denied reports Wednesday that IAEA 
inspectors had taken samples from North Korea's controversial 
5-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon. 
  IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said the inspectors had completed 
checking a key radiochemical laboratory, but failed to take 
samples from spent fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor. 
  He said the UN experts had finished additional inspections 
of 
the laboratory last weekend, completing the task of collecting 
samples from the lab that was begun in March. 
  Meanwhile, an IAEA negotiating team began talks with North 
Korean officials to discuss technical issues related to 
witnessing the fuel rod replacement. The negotiations are to 
resume Thursday, but it is uncertain when and how they will end, 
Meyer added. 
  The two-man negotiating team headed by Demitri Perricos, 
IAEA 
safeguards department director, that arrived in Pyongyang 
Tuesday met with the North Koreans Wednesday, meyer said. 
  Of the three inspectors who came to North Korea last 
weekend, 
two were taking part in the negotiations while the third left 
the country for Vienna to report the inspection results to the 
IAEA.

  [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu called on North Korea Thursday to fulfill 
its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
and the inter-Korean denuclearization agreement. 
  An era of reconciliation and cooperation can begin only when 
North Korea embraces a policy of co-existence and cooperation, 
Han said in his keynote speech at the opening of an 
international seminar titled "Nuclear Policies in Northeast 
Asia." 
  The seminar opened at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and 
National Security (IFANS) under the joint sponsorship of the UN 
Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) in Seoul for a 
two-day run. 
  Over 60 experts from home and abroad are participating in 
the 
seminar including UNIDIR director Sverre Lodgaard, German 
Ambassador at large Josef Holik, Tokyo University Professor 
Takashi Inoguchi and a senior fellow at the China Institute of 
International Studies, Tan Han. 
  South Korea fully supports extension of the NPT beyond its 
scheduled expiration in 1995 and also favors strengthening the 
nuclear safeguards measures of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), Han told the seminar. 
  The seminar is divided into four sections on the nuclear 
policies of Northeast Asia, the potential for nuclear 
proliferation, preventive action against such proliferation, and 
the nuclear policies of Russia, China, Japan, the United States 
and South and North Korea.

  [Text] Taegu, May 26 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister [and 
chairman of the National Unification Board, NUB] Yi Hong-ku 
stressed on Thursday that the North Korean nuclear question has 
to be resolved not by third parties but by responsible 
authorities of the two Koreas. 
  In a speech at the "Square for Unification Dialogue" held at 
the Hillside Hotel here, Yi said, "to this end, there needs 
government efforts to tackle those productive areas that can be 
agreed on and implemented under the principle of resolution 
between the direct parties involved." 
  He said that since the nuclear issue is an all-important 
question over which the nation's survival is at stake, the 
government's basic stand is that it cannot allow inter-Korean 
exchanges or economic cooperation unless there is a substantial 
progress in nuclear negotiations. 
  "North Korea cannot possess nuclear arms because if they do, 
it would shatter power balance between South and North Korea and 
would possibly lead to giving Japan an excuse to go nuclear 
itself to the prejudice of peace order in Northeast Asia," 
Deputy Premier Yi said. 
  Also saying that the country now needs the kind of education 
to prepare for unification, Yi said the people should now 
prepare to share post-unification burdens.

  [Text] The government on 25 May decided to take firm 
measures in conjunction with the United States and the UN 
Command against North Korea's attempt to establish "the Korean 
People's Army representative mission at Panmunjom," under the 
assessment that its intent is to incapacitate the Military 
Armistice Commission [MAC] as well as to conclude a peace 
agreement with the United States through direct negotiations. 
  That day, the UN Command announced that it plans to ask 
North 
Korea to hold a senior secretaries' meeting of the committee at 
the earliest possible date to discuss the issue. 
  Assessing the current attempts of North Korea as being 
driven 
by the hidden intention to disperse the international concern 
focused on the issue of nuclear inspection, the government 
decided to inform North Korea of its stance through a UN Command 
channel rather than taking a formal government-level reaction. 
  Regarding this, a government authority said: "The issue of 
substituting the present system of the Armistice Agreement, 
including the replacement of the Armistice Agreement, should be 
resolved independently by the North and South, the parties 
concerned. This corresponds with the spirit of the North-South 
Agreement," and added that "the North side should sincerely 
abide by the Armistice Agreement and normalize the MAC at an 
early date."

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (YONHAP) -- A high-level Chinese 
Foreign Ministry official visited Pyongyang last week and 
advised North Korea to compromise and negotiate a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear problem, a South Korean Embassy source 
here said Wednesday. 
  "A high-level official in charge of Asian Affairs at the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry came back after visiting North Korea 
last week," the source said, suggesting that Beijing is involved 
in last-minute efforts to persuade Pyongyang. 
  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told visiting 
South Korean Lawmaker Mun Chong-su, secretary-general of the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), Wednesday that his 
country is urging North Korea to settle the nuclear row through 
dialogue and that Pyongyang responded positively. 
  Tang said this information had been delivered to South Korea 
and the United States, according to DLP Spokesman Son Hak-kyu. 
  The Chinese Government welcomes South Korea's flexibility in 
trying to resolve the nuclear dispute, such as withdrawing its 
demand for an inter-Korean envoy exchange, Tang was quoted as 
saying. 
  On the delayed conclusion of a South Korean-Chinese aviation 
agreement, Tang said the two countries had agreed on overall 
principles and commercial airline companies must now determine 
the business terms of the pact. He said he hopes to see the 
agreement signed soon. 
  The vice foreign minister said the two countries will sign 
an 
agreement on forming a South Korea-China Industrial Committee 
sometime this month. South Korean Ambassador to Beijing Hwang 
Pyong-tae will sign the accord along with Wang Zhongyu, minister 
of the State Economic and Trade Commission. 
  The committee, agreed when South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam visited Beijing in March, is expected to convene its 
first meeting in Seoul.

  [Excerpts] Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae, 58, is not 
a career diplomat, although he passed the foreign service 
examination upon graduation from the Economics Department, 
College of Commerce of Seoul National University; most of his 
government career was with the Economic Planning Ministry. But 
he is not widely remembered as an official of the Economic 
Planning Ministry, either. After the position of deputy 
assistant at the ministry, he went for to study in the United 
States. Returning from this study, he pursued an academic 
career. 
  However, his academic career did not last forever. He 
transformed himself into a politician, assuming the role of a 
political advisor on international affairs to now President Kim 
after meeting the President during his tenure as the director of 
Foreign Language Institute. He had served as a member of the 
13th National Assembly representing Kangnam district of Seoul. 
  And, with the advent of the Kim Yong-sam administration, he 
is now a diplomat: Korean Ambassador to Beijing, with which our 
government established an official relationship less than a year 
ago and things have not been quite settled yet. It has been 
only five months since Ambassador Hwang took office as the 
ambassador in late May 1993. 
  With his various career experiences come the stories. It has 
been reported that he was in charge of political funds for 
President Pak Chong-hui as a deputy assistant minister of the 
Economic Planning Ministry. [passage omitted] 
  [Pak] Reforms in Korea and those in China are completely 
different..., how would you define, in fact, the nature of 
China's reforms? 
  [Hwang] There was a surprising news article in the paper 
this 
morning. The article said that China will recruit 14,000 
professionals in the fields of economics and technology. 
According to China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's latest 
comment, the engine of China's socioeconomic development is 
China's elite. He further insisted that the elite should take 
the lead to lighten the burden borne by the general public. 
This implies, it seems to me, that he sees Chinese society as 
two tiered: the elite and the general public. What do you 
think of that? Officially, China pursues a socialistic path but 
in reality its economy is entirely similar to that of a 
capitalist system. 
  The difference you would find between our current economic 
system and that of China, if you really have to look for one, is 
in name only. Our market economy may be called an enlightened 
market economy. The only distinction we might draw between our 
economic approach of the 70's and the 80's, and the socialist 
approach, is that we called ours government planning and 
guidance instead of socialism. 
  In some aspects, China is more open than we were. A typical 
example of this is the broad recognition of a local government 
authority over its economy. Local governments have jurisdiction 
over foreign trade activities under 20 million dollars. Most 
import authority, except for major items such as automobiles and 
TDX's (Transistor Data Exchanges), have been transferred to 
local governments. 
  We should also note that China is training professionals and 
entrepreneurs. In spite of systemic problems in its socialist 
mechanism, China currently practices a market economy backed by 
the Government. Whatever discrepancy there is, it's merely 
semantic. In substance, it's exactly a market economy. 
Recently Lawrence Kline, during the seminar he conducted in 
China, said: The economy we see in China, called a socialistic 
market economy, is a transitional phenomenon from socialism to 
market capitalism, i.e. from a planned economy to a market 
economy. 
  Jiang Zemin, president and Communist Party General 
Secretary, 
questioned (Kline) for an hour and a half. What China is hoping 
for is that it would eventually arrive at a system--through the 
course it is taking--in which all systems would function under a 
market economy, except its political power structure, which 
would remain controlled by the Communist Party. Of course, one 
big question still remains: Can the Communist Party can keep 
its grip on power as the economy transforms into a 
market-oriented system. My view is this: The Chinese Communist 
Party could be successful, for a while anyway, because the 
Chinese people recognize and accept a one party dictatorship of 
the Communist Party. The Chinese accept this, whereas the 
Russians would not. 
  This is why, lately, President Pak Chong-hui's economic 
development models implemented in the early days of our economic 
development, and his biography are gaining popularity in China. 
[passage omitted] I repeat: there are a great many similarities 
between China today and Korea in the early days of President Pak 
Chong-hui's rule. How the people of China manage the current of 
democratic change would greatly affect the record rate of 
China's economic development seen at the present time. 
  [Pak] Right after the Tiananmen Square incident, a scholar 
named Ha Shin of the China Academy of Social Science (CASS) came 
up with a theory called neo-authoritarianism which summarized 
what you, Mr. Ambassador, have just said. In short, the 
conclusion of this neo-authoritarianism theory is that 
"political authoritarianism is necessary to bring about economic 
development in Asia." 
  Validity of the theory has been evident in the Nationalist 
Party system in Taiwan, the Lee Kuan Yew system of Singapore, 
the period of Japan immediately following Meiji Restoration, and 
our own past. Not long ago Mr. Peter Hyon [Hyon Ung] related 
the following episode as I met with him in Beijing. Some time 
ago, Mr. Peter Hyon asked President Pak, "When are we going to 
have democracy in our country?" And, President Pak was said to 
have replied: "At the present, we can hardly expect to see true 
democracy in our country because we do not have the middle class 
as a nation. But it is probable that we will have democracy 
once formation of the middle class becomes reality as the result 
of successful implementation of my economic development 
policies." 
  Mr. Peter Hyon seems to imply that there is irony in our 
country's political scene. What he means is that it was 
President Pak's successful economic development, which brought 
about the formation of the middle class in our country, that 
made the advent of a civilian government of President Kim 
Yong-sam. He was the most critical political adversary of 
President Pak's. The power base of this government is the 
middle class. Nevertheless, I wonder if we can genuinely call 
the current political system in Korea democratic rather than 
authoritarian. There seems to be something amiss in the system, 
though we can not exactly pinpoint it, in spite of the 
expectations we all had for the new administration early on. 
  The reform measures carried out in Korea seem to be 
"forcedly 
administered" in accordance with President Kim's visions, by any 
definition. This seems to be incompatible with the current 
worldwide trend. Although, I suppose, future scholars of 
political science would sort out President Kim's reforms..., how 
about, Mr. Ambassador, giving us your views on this? (As soon 
as I presented this question to him, Ambassador Hwang asked me 
to change the subject. And he wanted our conversation centered 
around the events in China. Thus, our subject of conversation 
turned to China.) 
  [Hwang] Let us look at what the future holds for China. In 
addition to the fact that China's economy is currently growing 
at the rate of more than ten percent yearly, one thing we have 
to pay close attention to is the national trait of Chinese 
people. I mean their patience in spite of everything. I 
believe the people of China, with their patience and 
forbearance, will definitely surprise the world. They are 
showing, these days, the kind of economic growth observed in the 
record-rate growth of Japan in the 60's and in our own economic 
growth of the 70's. By the time the 21st century rolls around, 
their economic growth will definitely surprise the world. And, 
as the economy grows, the democracy will follow; wouldn't you 
say? 
  Here, once again, the question one might raise is how long 
the socialist ruling system of the Communist Party could last. 
Although this is strictly my own personal opinion, we are the 
only country among Asian nations that arrived at democracy as 
the result of economic growth. Where Korea has arrived is only 
a natural outcome, considering that the path it took was a 
textbook case of the Western theories. Yet, it remains to be 
seen whether the case of Korea could be considered a general 
rule applicable to the development history of all Asian nations 
or an exception. 
  It would be difficult to expect, even after the year 2000, 
that there would be a change in China from the state of the 
system in which the press were censored and that the Communist 
Party would not cling to the system of one party rule. But I 
suspect there would be a change in division of power between the 
central and the local governments in China. What I mean by this 
is that the central government would deal with foreign policies 
and national defense, and economic matters would become the 
responsibilities of various local governments. In other words, 
I am contemplating the possibility of China, with such vast 
territory, becoming a "United States of China" as the result of 
division of power between its central and provincial governments. 
  [Pak] However, publications in Hong Kong gave the impression 
that the reform faction, who attempted the delegation of power 
to provincial governments, had been crushed during the course of 
Tiananmen Square incident. They said that, at the time, Za 
Ji-yang, the General Secretary of the Party, initiated the 
process of delegating authority to local governments, having 
concluded that "the centralized power was not the answer," and 
came to encounter the Tiananmen Square incident, and that 
Premier Li Peng, after the Tiananmen Square incident, stalled 
the delegation of power process and began to reinforce 
centralization of power. 
  [Hwang] Nonetheless, currently, the most often debated 
subject is actually local governments' rights to separation of 
power. They say that this is a major subject of research at the 
Chinese Academy of Social Science. There have been numerous 
books written about it and I recall an article stating, "The 
worst enemy of China is in the provincial issues." 
  At any rate, there is hardly a sense of insecurity about 
openness and reform in China today. The people feel confident 
enough in carrying out reforms to be adventurous. One other 
indisputable fact is that Mao Zedong's populism is finished in 
China. But it seems that this is not the case in our country. 
I remember reading a Korean newspaper article, in which the 
writer stated, "Ten percent of the public are reluctant to 
endorse the reform although 90 percent welcome it." The point 
the writer is making is that the ten percent still deserve 
critical attention even though the reform was being applauded by 
the other 90 percent. 
  In socialism, certain measures are designed for popularity 
with the masses rather than being based on their own merits, 
but the reform measures in China today are based on their own 
strengths. For farmers, the only measure taken by the state is 
economic assistance such as providing the development funds, 
otherwise, they are left alone. Thus, the populism is 
disappearing in the economic front, as well. 
  [Pak] There is Ozawa in Japan and there is Deng Xiaoping, 
though aged, in China. Who, in your opinion, would be the 
comparable leader in our country who would lead the nation with 
a set of objectives? 
  [Hwang] In my opinion, President Kim holds the idea that 
"power is inherently corrupt," having spent 30 years as an 
opposition party leader. Accordingly, he is strong on 
dissecting things but seems to have somewhat detached optimism 
toward a subject matter, once sorted out, in following it 
through. He seems to believe that things do get better when you 
shake them up. For the truth of the matter, we will just have to 
wait and see. Economic matters do not always seem to follow 
this reasoning. 
  [Pak] As for the precedence in China of controlling cultural 
life being an impossible task as seen in the short-lived 
Cultural Revolution initiated by Mao Zedong... 
  [Hwang] What it amounts to is that Mao Zedong stepped on a 
tiger's tail. 
  [Pak] Cultural Revolution ended in 1976 Tiananmen incident. 
The forcible control of the incident by the military killed the 
Cultural Revolution. Learning a lesson from this, do you think 
it at all possible that the reform in Korea might end in the 
same fashion one day suddenly like the demonstrators in front of 
Seoul City Hall, crushed with force because of the policies that 
encourage and please only the poor and lower strata of our 
society? 
  [Hwang] It seems unlikely. President Kim has long, hard 
experience with political dissent. He is identified with the 
mass participatory democracy (democracy in which the mass public 
participates). The mass democracy surrounding the Cultural 
Revolution was not quite the same thing. Should I have to 
define the current state in Korea whether it was a mass 
democracy or an elitism democracy, I would at the moment, tend 
to call it a mass democracy. 
  If detracted, a mass democracy could result in a populism. 
What started as a mass democracy could, by one misstep, become 
a populism. However, in any event, there will be a period of 
pause for reassessment our reform after it reaches a certain 
point. You cannot just tear things down nonstop, of course. If 
things begin to generate fears, there could be little chance for 
any further construction. The way I see is that the 
house-cleaning and the symbolic phases of reform have been 
concluded with the implementation of the real name financial 
system. What remain would be reform efforts in areas such as 
education, administration and financial system. I can not 
imagine that the President would make any wrong move. He is now 
at the threshold of his policy for which he would need a 
metaphysical perspective and operations management skills. In 
the case of Mao Zedong, there is strong evidence that he was 
reaching for equality of consequences and horizontal equality; 
in other words, he was not only for economic but also political 
equality. But President Kim, quite apart from what Mao Zedong 
personified, is trying to realize much more liberal democracy, 
through his reform which is a reflection of reassessment and 
surgical in nature. There is no comparison between President 
Kim and Mao Zedong because what President Kim is trying to 
accomplish is not to realize equality for all but to carry out a 
"surgical operation" as the necessary intermittent course of 
action. And, there is no paralled between the two. 
  [Pak] Russia is lately going through turmoil. Originally, 
Russia and China had the same political system; yet, China seems 
to keep things relatively well under control and Russia seems to 
have such difficulty; what could be the reason? 
  [Hwang] There are two reasons. Russia has been a country 
which has not meant to be one nation. What binds a nation 
together is its nationalism; is it not? A sovereign state has 
to have a common sense of a nation in order to establish itself 
as a nation and the Soviet Union was not able to establish 
itself as a nation from the very beginning. The reason the 
Soviet Union, despite this, became a nation is that it used the 
ideology, socialism, as the common thread binding the nation 
instead of nationality. Thus, the first reason: The Soviet 
Union had used the oppressive policies of communism. 
  The biggest distinction we see between China and the Soviet 
Union is that China still retains its nationality even after the 
worldwide demise of socialist foundation. And the second reason 
is that China, backed by this nationality and through its 
economic development, was able to give its citizens hope that 
they would have a better living. 
  I think the foundation for better living in the Soviet Union 
fell also after the fall of socialist foundation, don't you? 
Thus, I believe the nation which benefits the most from the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union is China. The People of 
China are confident. I think the people of China themselves 
care very little about issues such as freedom and so forth but 
are all for making money right now, although the outside world 
has been busy lately talking about the anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square incident; don't you? They concern themselves 
little with things like human rights. 
  [Pak] I remember a story. At the time of the fall of the 
Soviet Union, Deng Xiaoping was said to have remarked: "In 
Russia, the man named Gorbachev violated a cardinal rule. 
Disregarding Marx's maxim that, for an organization, the change 
of its upper echelon would naturally follow if its base units 
were successfully changed, Gorbachev initiated perostroyka which 
was intended for reform of the upper structure and ended up in 
miserable failure for the lower structure too of the Soviet 
Union." And Deng Xiaoping was said to have instructed that the 
firm grips on the upper echelon should continue but there should 
be diligent efforts to nurture and strengthen the lower echelon. 
  [Hwang] The story has a good point. The Soviet Union had to 
deal with the additional problem of geographic sectarianism in 
addition to the fall of its two main ideologies: socialism and 
equality. And the Soviet Union ended in turmoil, as it was not 
equipped with an ideology to overcome this sectarianism, and the 
central government authority disintegrated. Furthermore, the 
third contributing factor was the fact that the hope for a 
better future of its people, too, has been destroyed; hasn't it? 
Contrasting this, there is a superabundant hope among its 
people in China that the 1.2 billion population will have a 
better future with improved living standards, don't you think? 
  [Pak] Some say that the reforms currently in progress in 
Korea do not accompany a strong lower-level structure, 
organizationally. What they are saying is that the whole system 
could become shaky as the result of the current frequent 
practice of restructuring and cutting the upper echelon under 
the assumption that all is well with the lower echelon as the 
upper echelon in the days of (5-6 Kong) could easily have been 
manipulated to implement successful economic policies for their 
ineptitude. 
  [Hwang] They have a point. Because we realize that what 
President Pak had practiced was the economy pulled by an 
enlightened government. This economy pulled by an enlightened 
government seems to be in a state of confusion because it lost 
its center post one morning as the political scene had changed. 
Supposing that you wake up one morning to find that for a 
government assistance to your business had been dashed, you 
would naturally be overcome by the fear of your bankruptcy; 
wouldn't you? I would like to call it regimentation, i.e. 
business health maintenance. Although President Kim had already 
stated along the same lines, I believe, the system should be 
able to nourish businesses despite the change in political power 
structure. We cannot afford the government's hands-off policy 
neglecting the health maintenance of businesses. 
  You know as well as I do that a patient's life depends on 
the 
care given for recovery after surgery. This is precisely the 
type of problem our nation's economy faces right now. it raises 
a vital concern for us to contemplate where we would be in the 
next few years with economic growth of only four percent per 
year compared to the 13 percent annual growth rate of China with 
a population of 1.2 billion. One other point here: it would 
indeed be a grave situation if the relationship between our 
economy and China's ever became competitive. We must keep the 
relationship to be one of co-existence and cooperation. From 
the start, we and China were not to compete against each other. 
  The point I would like to make is that we should place 
strong 
emphasis on investment in China rather than trade. Our 
investment would lead a path to a joint progress through our 
technological resource and China's labor force. This is a 
relationship of coexistence and cooperation. We ought to 
cultivate a strategic relationship of cooperation with China 
through our investment in such industrial fields such as the 
automotive industry. If we limit ourselves to short-term trade, 
which is bound to be competitive in nature, we would not last 
for very long. The objectives of Korea-China relations should 
be coexistence-cohabitation centered around investment rather 
than trade. 
  [Pak] Although what you have just said is probably true in 
an 
economic field, China appears to hold its prescribed opinions on 
its neighboring countries as was shown in the political 
situation of Cambodia. It seems that China would like to have 
the governments of the nations near its border under its 
influence as was demonstrated in its welcome for Sihanouk with 
open arms when he had nowhere else to turn to. China has 
maintained its own plans on North Korea and I wonder if it has 
not had its operating objectives toward South Korea, with which 
it had not had official relations for the past 40 years, to 
realize a structural change in, South Korea, receptive to its 
political influence. 
  [Hwang] In the past, there had been a period in China when 
its internal politics were dictated by Mao Zedong and its 
foreign policies by Chou En-lai. During the period, Chou En-lai 
left a monumental legacy, considered to be of timeless 
soundness, for the conduct of international politics. To be 
exact, it consists of five principles of peaceful coexistence. 
Those five principles are still adhered to, today by the 
government of China. I believe some of the results of China's 
foreign policy based on the five principles are seen precisely 
in the cases of Cambodia's Sihanouk and also of Arafat; wouldn't 
you say? 
  I heard that Arafat visited China more than 30 times. There 
has been not a single deviation in China's foreign policy 
conduct from the five principles of peace. (Chon Ki-song), 
(foreign minister of China), has been saying the same thing at 
the United Nations recently. Ever since the Bandung Conference 
of 1955, they have consistently been the guiding principles of 
China's foreign policy. During that time, even faced with some 
hard choices, China has been consistent in maintaining its 
posture adhering to the principles without a compromise. This 
is the foundation, I believe, on which China has been able to 
maintain consistent relations with Sihanouk and Arafat. China's 
move on North-South Korea relations is based on the principles, 
as well. I understand China made its position clear stating 
that it "supported negotiated relsolution through dialogues but 
opposed any rival conflict as a means of solution for the 
North-South Korea relations and firmly believed in nuclear-free 
Korean peninsula." 
  These principles maintained by China impressed Kim Il-son 
recently, as well. It appears that Kim Il-song acknowledged 
them, for the first time. He said, "China's reform and open 
policies are going rather well." China's five principles of 
peace are having great effects on the relations between the 
United States and North Korea. I suspect the reasons behind 
North Korea's approach to the United States, of course, are to 
prevent a United States military attack or economic embargo. 
  However, the principal cause for North Korea's overture to 
the United States was, above all, the application by China of 
its five principles of peace to the issues of Korean peninsula. 
Eventually, North Korea had little choice but to follow the 
Chinese initiative. As you may recall, North Korea clearly 
stated that it would maintain dialogues with the United States 
as China wished, and lead a policy toward foundation for 
stability in Korean peninsula and its borders," to Ho Kum-su, a 
regular member of the Chinese Communist Party Political Bureau, 
and Wang Han-mu, Vice Chairman of the Standing committee of the 
National People's Congress of China, during their visits to 
Pyongyang. 
  I wrote about this in my report to Seoul not long ago. North 
Korea's openness would follow once the nuclear issue between the 
United States and North Korea, and the problems between South 
and North Korea and between North Korea and the International 
Atomic Energy agency were resolved. Kim Il-song would move 
quickly to openness. That was my report. 
  Also, I sent a long report concerning our approach, had 
North 
Korea decided to take the road of reform and openness. We would 
benefit from China's five principles of peace, just as Sihanouk 
of Cambodia did. 
  [Pak] If my memory serves me correctly, I believe diplomatic 
issues had been nearly non-existent in China during the Cultural 
Revolution because of preoccupation with internal problems. 
There had not been, on China's part, any mention of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence for some time, even after the 
Cultural Revolution. About the fall of 1989 China all of a 
sudden proclaimed "We will resurrect the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence we had in past and adopt them as the 
principles for foreign policy of today. It seems to me that this 
revival of the five principles of peaceful coexistence of the 
50's happened because China saw the need for peace and order in 
carrying out its reform, openness, and economic development, as 
it was experiencing internal difficulties surrounding the 
incident of Tiananmen Square. Lately, the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence are being applied to the issues of Korean 
peninsula as well. Have you not observed any attempt or move by 
China to secure a leverage for its influence in Korea, i.e. to 
install a group supporting China by forming a pro-China 
political faction in Seoul, etc.? 
  [Hwang] On that point, the Chinese do not seem to be overly 
anxious. The way they see it, it seems, is that China could 
return to its past glory as a strong power by uplifting its 
economy as a nation, and freeing itself of foreign economic 
pressures. What they are trying to do preponderantly seems to 
be to maintain good-neighbor relations with most of the nations 
of the world, but to be alert enough not to be ignored or 
intimidated by any. They seem to think that the number of the 
nation's population, 1.2 billion, in and by itself gives them a 
supremacy. 
[Pak] Not long ago, Kim Il-song had made, it seems to me, a 
remark of major proportion when he said, "China's reform is 
encouraging to us, North Koreans," during the visit to Pyongyan 
by (Wang Han-mu), (Vice Chairman of the National People's 
Congress (NPC)) of China. 
  [Hwang] Kim Il-song came to Beijing 99 times, but, since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between South Korea and 
China last year, he has not made a single visit to Beijing. 
China discontinued its once brisk exchanges with North Korea 
and high-level exchange has become infrequent. After one year 
of this kind of atmosphere, Kim Il-song had no choice but to say 
that China's reform was the right course of action. That portion 
of Kim Il-song's speech in which he said that "China had become 
a nation of wealth through its reform and openness" deserves a 
special attention. The word "wealth" is reminiscent of the old 
concept of "a nation of wealth and mighty army" and not of a 
vocabulary conducive to the socialistic ideals. In other words, 
the word connotes the idea of luxury living; wouldn't you agree? 
The word takes the bite out of combative spirit. Thus, we 
might say that what Kim Il-song said was that Chinas' becoming a 
nation of wealth had been an encouragement to North Korea. 
Realizing this, we can understand why Kim Il-song said to China 
"there would be no rival conflict in Korean peninsula." And, 
about the nuclear issue, he said that there would be 
satisfactory dialogues with the United States. This, I believe, 
was the meaning of Kim Il-song's statement. 
  Although it might be somewhat premature to draw a conclusion 
definitely as such, I suspect, reading fine points in what Kim 
Il-song said, that North Korea would join hands with China soon, 
is pursuing its reform and openness. In this context, it calls 
our attention to the fact that North Korea is ready to accept 
China's venture capital in the Nachin frontier area, north of 
Chongjin. One other interesting development is the story being 
circulated that North Korea would give a 50 year lease of 
Chongjin to China. 
  My gut feeling is that North Korea is trying to develop the 
area of the Nachin frontier and Tumen river basin to such a 
massive scale that, once completed, would resemble nothing we 
have seen or heard of so far in North Korea. What North Korea 
is betting on is that once China invests its capital in the 
region, naturally South Korea would follow and, then, Japan, 
Taiwan and Hong Kong and so forth, as well. It would be a big 
mistake if we did not take our part in the investment and left 
when China invested its capital in North Korea. We have to 
prepare ourselves for this. As for Kim Il-song, I doubt he 
would ask for a direct dealing with South Korea. He would 
probably look for the dealings with South Korea through China. 
This is one of the reasons why our relationship with China is 
critical to us. 
  [Pak] If and when such a prediction becomes reality, I 
suppose our economic potency, above all, would be a critical 
factor; do you think we might be left out because of our less 
than ideal economic posture? 
  [Hwang] There are a few facts that should make us feel safe 
as far as China is concerned. First, we are at least 10 years 
ahead of China in economic development. 
  Secondly, we as a people have always been very cost 
conscious, i.e. driven for efficiency. In contrast, cost 
consciousness or cost accounting is not the norm in China. This 
is, in a way, a detrimental shortcoming of China's economy. 
  Thirdly, people in China are used to being ordered around by 
bureaucrats to manage their economic lives. It would take a 
long time for China to arrive at the properly functional 
mechanism and system of its economy, including those financial 
and monetary areas. Recently, they have been studying Japan's 
monetary system. Setting up the system alone would take China 
the next four to five years at least, as they are currently 
debating about institution of a taxation system. 
  As for economic systems, I believe China is 10 to 15 years 
behind us. I don't think we have to worry much if China 
continues at this current pace. If we fail to invest more 
capital and improve our technology, and China keeps up its 
economic growth at the current rate, which is 13 percent per 
year, we will have a big problem. However, we need not worry, I 
believe, if we deal with the situation, as we did before, with 
new investment and continued improvement on management 
technology of our industry. 
  [Pak] Yasushi Akashi, a former Japanese Ambassador to 
Thailand, is famous for having made it possible for Japan to 
expand outward. As an ambassador to a Southeast Asian nation, 
he led Japan into Southeast Asia. Have you, Ambassador, 
considered yourself the Korean version of Yasushi Akashi 
regarding our relationship with China? 
  [Hwang] There has been a lot of criticism lately. As you 
probably heard, the Germans rushed into their reunification too 
hastily. What is clear to us is that the reunification of North 
and South Korea is the most important of all issues regardless 
of its final shape or form. Nevertheless, we can learn a lesson 
from the case of East and West Germany and be ready to let North 
Korea choose its own way of life, which, I believe, is terribly 
important. Even after the fundamental issues were ironed out, I 
am afraid that there would be a considerably long period in 
which North and South Korea would be in a state of commonwealth 
or federation, meaning one nation with two different systems. 
In order to achieve all these, we must maintain our close 
relationship with China. The reason for this is obvious. North 
Korea is currently in a situation where it would welcome any 
party that came jointly with China. The timing and the laying 
of foundations for unification should also be attempted and 
attained with the help of China. 
  [Pak] It has been over five months now since you arrived in 
May of this year. How do you, Mr. Ambassador, assess the 
situation? Has it been a wise policy decision, on our part, 
that China should lend a helping hand in order to keep North 
Korea from causing any trouble? 
  [Hwang] North Korea at present still remains a country whose 
people are have a hard time just affording three meals a day. 
In contrast, per capita income in South Korea is more than 
6,000 dollars and if the two countries merge, with this 
backdrop, it is highly probable that this disparity would cause 
a further division internally for the nation. The economic 
disparity would naturally lead into cultural discord and 
adversely affect the very lives of the people. We must exercise 
the utmost care in order not to rush into things as even Mr. Kim 
Tae-chung stressed. It takes time to solve socioeconomic 
problems. I believe any hasty action out of political 
expendiencey could simply compound the problem. 
  [Pak] I recall seeing Mr. Han Sung-ju, once in the early 
part 
of this year, prior to becoming the Foreign Minister, on 
television conversing with Professor Lester Thurow of the United 
States. As Minister Han said "we were greatly concerned about 
the cost of unification," Professor Thurow, with a grin in his 
face, was saying: "West Germany had a detailed plan to improve 
the East German living standard to the same level as West 
Germany's within five years. Part of this plan included a 
program to install a $3,000 cellular telephone for East German 
families despite the fact that the West Germans used an 800 
dollar telephone in their homes. This was an example of why it 
was necessary for West Germany to deal with unification cost. 
But I would question, indeed, if such preposterous measures 
would necessarily be considered a part of Korean unification 
cost." He seemed to be saying, in other words, it could be a 
strategic mistake for South Korea to place too heavy an emphasis 
on unification planning, and... 
  [Hwang] Professor Thurow is purely an academic economist. 
Economic solutions alone would not bring answers to 
politico-cultural questions and the emotional question of a 
nation within. We should consider unification cost a secondary 
issue. Problems we would face as a nation are political though 
they contain elements of economics, too, to a degree. Consider, 
if you will, that there are people who shed tears simply by 
viewing Kim Il-song, in North Korea, particularly. This is not 
the same as the East Germans felt about Honecker. 
  We have to look and see things beyond their superficial 
appearances. Even the Japanese are getting worried that there 
might be an influx of the North Korean refugees as the result of 
a riot in North Korea... Consider this for a moment, if you 
would. Supposing that a mass of North Koreans came and lived in 
Uichongbu, it would bring hardship to people living in Seoul, 
also. We should be concerned about what in reality had happened 
in Germany, i.e. a flood of East Germans came and lived in 
rural areas of West Germany. 
  [Pak] What should be the role of our embassy in China and 
what can we expect the embassy would accomplish? Please tell me 
your views on this, from the experience you have had so far. 
  [Hwang] The role of Korean Ambassador to China is to seek 
out 
the best ways to maintain comfortable coexistence between Korea 
and China, especially, in the future, in the 21st century. In 
short, the role should be to enhance the relations of the two 
countries based on economic matters, also to go above and beyond 
economics and, thus, coexist.

  [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- The question of getting 
repaid the credits South Korea had extended to Russia will not 
be discussed during the upcoming visit to Moscow by President 
Kim Yong-sam, a senior government official said Thursday. 
  Instead, the government will send a Finance Ministry mission 
to Moscow in early June to sound out the possibility of 
obtaining the repayment in kind, Second Assistant Finance 
Minister Yim Chang-yol said. 
  While meeting with reporters Yim said the government 
believes 
that getting the credits repaid in kind best serves national 
interests under the present circumstances. 
  The Finance Ministry mission will be led by Chong Tok-ku, 
Finance Ministry's director-general for international 
cooperation, he said. 
  The assistant minister said that it may be possible to 
obtain 
the repayment in such goods as coal, machinery and asbestos and 
in the right to use land for the construction of a Korean trade 
center in Moscow. 
  If the feasibility of obtaining the repayment in kind were 
determined in the mission's visit early next month, a meeting of 
high economic cooperation officials will take place toward the 
end of June or early July to discuss the matter in earnest, he 
said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
lunched with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe on 
Thursday, exchanging views on matters of mutual concern 
including promotion of bilateral economic cooperation. 
  President Kim said, "Our two nations have expanded 
cooperative relations in various fields since we formed 
diplomatic ties in 1977. In particular, bilateral economic 
exchanges have developed remarkably. I am very satisfied that 
South Korea, as the most important investor in Sri Lanka, is 
contributing very much to the development of that country."

  [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- Trade, Industry and Energy 
Minister Kim Chol-su and his Japanese counterpart Eijiro Hata 
held the third Korea-Japan trade ministers' meeting in Tokyo on 
Thursday, with both agreeing to expand cooperation in such 
high-tech information fields as multi-media. 
  They also decided to open a working-level meeting headed by 
division director-level officials from Korea's Trade, Industry 
and Energy Ministry and Japan's International Trade and Industry 
Ministry. 
  Through the meeting, the two governments aim to spur 
standardization, joint research, technology cooperation and 
personnel education in the multi-media sector. 
  The move indicates that technology cooperation between Seoul 
and Tokyo has shifted from traditional to more sophisticated 
industries. 
  Moreover, the two ministers agreed that the Seoul Government 
will choose model small- and medium-sized firms in such areas as 
home electronic appliances, general machinery and automobile 
parts manufacturing, and then the Japanese Government will send 
experts to these Korean companies to provide support. 
  Korea will dispatch 200 additional trainees from small- and 
medium-sized companies to Japan in 1995-98 and Tokyo will send 
20 experts this year and 30 experts from 1995 annually to Seoul. 
  The Japanese Government also plans to send an economic 
delegation to Seoul in late October to study investment 
conditions. 
  Meanwhile, a 100-member Korean delegation headed by the 
chairman of the Korea-Japan Economic Association, Pak Yong-hak, 
is visiting Tokyo, Osaka and Kita Kyushu from May 25-31 to 
attract Japanese investment.

<F P=106> [From the "Press Pocket" column] </F>
  [Text] Former opposition party leader Yi Chol-sung 
criticized Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu for calling North 
Korean President Kim Il-song "great leader" and expressing 
regrets over Korea's dispatch of combat troops to Vietnam during 
the Vietnam War. 
  Yi alleged that Han's remarks were apparently "derogatory to 
the soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War for the cause of 
democracy." 
  He also took issue with Han saying that "his life was saved 
by a North Korean soldier during the Korean War when he was 
seriously injured by the UN Forces' bombing." 
  Meanwhile, a ministry spokesman dismissed Yi's criticism as 
"ridiculous" saying that the word "great" has widely been used 
to jeer Kim Il-song rather than eulogize him. 
  Yi also denounced President Kim Yong-sam's personnel 
management by claiming that the government has appointed 
scholars holding "ambiguous ideologies" as Cabinet members, thus 
leaving his fellow orthodox rightists in disarray. 
  Yi also charged that former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung, 
now chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, is seeking a 
political comeback despite his repeated announcement of his 
retirement from politics. 
  Yi made a similar accusation Friday in a statement released 
in the name of a civic body he heads. 
  In an interview with the WASHINGTON TIMES, Kim had 
reportedly 
said even if Pyongyang possessed two or three atomic bombs, it 
would not be much of a problem compared with the 20,000 nuclear 
warheads that the United States has. 
  He also said that the United States should dispatch former 
president Jimmy Carter to Asia as a special envoy and invite 
North Korean President Kim to Washington. 
  The reports touched off a wave of criticism from the ruling 
Democratic Liberal Party and the National Unification Board for 
distracting the government's official nuclear policy aimed at 
eradicating North Korea's suspected nuclear arsenal. 
  Kim denied his remarks later, allegng that the reports were 
totally groundless. Kim even said that Pyongyang clandestine 
nuclear weapons program should be stopped at all costs and the 
government should be the sole channel of dialogue with North 
Korea.

  [Text] PHNOM PENH, May 26 (AFP) -- More than 200 Khmer 
Rouge rebels were killed in fighting in northwest Cambodia as 
government forces pushed their way down the road from Battambang 
to the rebel base at Pailin, a government official said Thursday. 
  Between 200 and 250 guerrillas died in the fighting 
Wednesday 
and three government soldiers were killed and another 27 wounded 
by land mines as they advanced down National Route 10, 
Battambang deputy governor Serey Kosal told AFP by telephone. 
  The governor said most of the guerrillas had been found 
strewn alongside the highway, killed by artillery fire, and that 
some 50 others appeared to have been executed by bullet shots in 
the back of the head. He said the 50 dead rebels had been 
executed by their commander for trying to retreat as government 
forces advanced to Phum Svay Sar, 10 kilometers (six miles) from 
Treng, which the government said it captured two days ago. 
Ammunition and weapons had also been left behind, he added. No 
independent confirmation was available. 
  Serey Kosal said that he would go to the highway Thursday 
and 
take photographs of the Khmer Rouge dead as evidence. 
  Treng was the government's frontline prior to an offensive 
that led to the capture of Pailin in March, one month before it 
was retaken by the rebels, who surged forward and pushed 
government forces back to within 15 kilometers (nine miles) of 
Battambang.

  [Text] Thailand has put forward a proposal to the United 
States on exchange of agricultural information, global market 
forecasts and technological know-how for farm production. 
  The Secretary-general of the Office of Agricultural 
Economics, Pitiphong Phungbun na Ayutthaya, said the proposal 
was raised with the US Department of Agriculture at a recent 
meeting. 
  Mr Pitiphong said the US has such an agreement with the 
European Union, China and Indonesia, and wants a similar one 
with Thailand because of the implications of the recent 
conclusion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  Thailand is interested in the exchange programme, 
particularly with regard to the farm products of countries which 
have exchange agreements with the US. The agreement with the US 
will give Thailand access to information on farm products of 
these countries. 
  Cooperation can begin immediately after negotiations are 
completed within three months. 
  US agriculture officials will arrive for discussion with Mr 
Pitiphong in June after their trips to Indonesia. 
  On a proposal of the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] agreement 
to include non-processed agricultural products in the agreement 
list, he said the office is in the process of informal 
discussion as there has been no official request yet for the 
inclusion. Should there be a formal request, a study must be 
conducted to gauge its long-term impact on the products, he said. 
  If non-processed products are included in the AFTA list 
products which are subsidised will be affected because they will 
be uncompetitive.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Foreign Investment Law Revised To </F>
Further Attract Investors"] 
  [Text] The government of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic has amended its foreign investment law to further 
convince foreign investors of investment opportunities in the 
country. 
  The amended law, which is now called the Foreign Investment 
Promotion and Management Law, was endorsed by the third ordinary 
session of the National Assembly (Third Legislature) held last 
month. This was seen as a remarkable and positive move by the 
Lao government in its economic policy which is at a new stage of 
development. 
  The amendments to this law were intended to make it suit the 
current investment climate in Lao PDR [People's Democratic 
Republic]. It reflects more clearly the renovation policy of 
the Lao government, and guarantees the interests of both the 
investor and the government. As this law is more or less 
related to the labor law, amendments were also made to the labor 
law during the same session. Improving the labor law ensures 
greater fairness in relations between employers and employees, 
both local and foreign. In 1988, the Lao government introduced 
an open-door policy of multilateral economic ties and 
cooperation with foreign countries in an effort to gradually 
strengthen the economy of the country along the lines of a 
market-oriented economy. To help realise this policy, it 
promulgated a foreign investment law in the same year which was 
designed to attract investors to boost the social and economic 
development of the country. A national level committee, known 
as the Foreign Investment Management Committee (FIMC) was set up 
under the Committee for Planning and Cooperation to promote and 
manage foreign investment. 
  Over the past years the open-door policy and the foreign 
investment law have to some extent added to the attraction of 
Laos in terms of business opportunities as well as for tourists. 
  Investment statistics obtained from the FIMC show that in 
the 
three months from January to March 1994 some 43 new licensed 
foreign investments coming to a total of U.S. $116 million were 
made. The investments cover such sectors as agribusiness, 
manufacturing, tourism, mining, construction, telecommunication, 
banking, and service industries. Of the sectors, the service 
industry takes the lead in terms of investment amount. 
  The investors are from such countries as Thailand, 
Australia, 
Italy, Japan, and China. 
  To keep foreign investment growing in the country, the Lao 
government will have to ensure the effective implementation of 
its newly amended foreign investment law.

  [Text] The Japan-U.S. Economic Framework Talks are set to 
resume, but Japan is already facing more problems because the 
United States wants to add five additional areas, including 
"banking services" to the list of priority issues to be 
addressed at the talks. 
  Japan faced a tough enough time at the talks settling the 
question of objective criteria in the existing agreed three 
priority, including automobiles and auto parts. The additions 
mean Japan faces difficult negotiations over more areas. 
  If the "deregulation and competitive policy" is included, it 
will probably have an impact on the outline of exterior economic 
policy reform, which the government planned to finish by the end 
of June. 
  Japan says it will discuss the issue of expanding the 
priority list with the United States, but it is expected to 
basically accept the U.S. request. "Banking services" and 
"deregulation and competitive policy" had been the subject of 
bilateral negotiations up until February, when the whole 
framework talks broke down. But because so little progress was 
made, the Japanese Government feels "this is a new start." 
  The "deregulation and competitive policy" area is expected 
to 
command a lot of attention and the Japanese Government is at 
present working on details to be included in the outline of the 
exterior economic policy reform. If Japan-U.S. negotiations on 
this area begin, it is possible that the U.S. demands on 
deregulation will be clearly visible in the outline. 
  Japan is very concerned about the fact that sheet glass and 
forestry products have been raised as areas for negotiation. 
Each is an area in which certain U.S. companies and pressure 
groups have been putting pressure on the U.S. Government. If 
Japan is slow to act, the United States may take sanctions under 
Section 301 of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. 
  In the informal negotiations on resuming the framework 
talks, 
the United States may appear to have made a concession by 
retracting its demand for numerical targets. However, its 
demand that additional trade areas be discussed can be seen as a 
new way of shaking up Japan.

<F P=106> ["MINJU CHOSON Lambastes U.S. Moves Against Disarmament" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
comments on the feverish promotion of a program of the 
development of a sophisticated missile by the United States to 
spot and destroy missiles of the DPRK "which are hidden 
underground." 
  The development of the new ultra-modern missile which is 
being hastened under the cloak of "nuclear non-proliferation" is 
a criminal act against nuclear disarmament, a renewed military 
operation against the independent third-world countries and a 
deliberate act for battening the U.S. war industrial monopolies, 
the analyst notes, and continues: 
  The present U.S. administration declared that the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is the "keynote of its 
state diplomacy." The United States, however, continues 
accelerating the modernisation of its nuclear weapons and, worse 
still, turns a blind eye to the development of nuclear weapons 
by its allies and some satellites, while casting suspicion and 
putting a bridle on the peaceful nuclear activities of the 
countries which go against the grain with it. 
  The Pentagon seeks the aim of crushing the DPRK with 
strength 
in developing a new missile and in inveigling the allies into 
the execution of its strategy while setting afloat the rumour of 
"nuclear threat." 
  The United States is drawing its allies including Japan into 
the execution of its aggressive strategy. 
  The Korean people strongly oppose the U.S. moves to gain 
nuclear monopoly and build up arms and stifle anti-imperialist, 
independent countries including the DPRK under the cloak of 
"nuclear non-proliferation". 
  The United States must not cry for the non-proliferation of 
nuclear weapons only in words, but carry it into practice. 
  It must, first of all, stop its wrong attempt to isolate and 
stifle the DPRK engaged in peaceful nuclear activities under the 
pretext of the latter's fictitious "nuclear threat" and withdraw 
its nuclear weapons and troops from South Korea. And it must 
stop applying a double standard and cut back and, furthermore, 
completely scrap the existing nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will hold working-group meetings in Tokyo June 1-2 to discuss 
two key areas for negotiations in bilateral trade "framework" 
talks, a government source said Thursday [26 May]. 
  The source said the early June meetings will deal with the 
issues of insurance, and autos and auto parts, two of the three 
sectors specified as "priorities" in the framework talks. 
  For the auto sector, vice ministerial-level talks are also 
slated for the second week of June in Tokyo. 
  The series of meetings are the first since the two countries 
agreed earlier this week to resume the framework negotiations, 
agreed last July to bring down Japan's large trade surplus with 
the U.S. 
  The trade process had been stalled since February this year 
due to differences over a U.S. demand to set numerical targets 
to gauge the openness of the Japanese market. Japan has 
staunchly refused the demand. 
  A working-group meeting for the remaining area -- government 
procurement -- has not yet been set, but will likely be held 
within the month of June.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
negotiation team, which arrived in Pyongyang on 24 May when the 
replacement of fuel rods was ongoing, began full-scale 
negotiations with relevant North Korean officials from 25 May. 
  During the negotiations on 25 May, the IAEA stressed that 
replacing fuel rods while not allowing inspection was a serious 
violation of the nuclear accord but North Korea only reconfirmed 
its previous stance that IAEA's demands cannot be accepted due 
to its special position of withholding the withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  According to a well-informed IAEA source, the negotiation 
will continue on 26 May even though there is no sign that the 
replacement of nuclear fuel rods may be suspended during the 
negotiations. 
  Relevant IAEA officials said that the IAEA inspection team 
completed its mission of inspecting North Korea's radiochemical 
laboratory but failed to extract samples from spent fuel rods of 
the five-megawatt reactor in question.

  [Text] A government delegation comprising representatives 
from the Ministry of Finance; the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Food Industry; the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social 
Welfare; and the Government Office paid a working visit to Quang 
Tri Province on 23-24 May to inspect the crop failure there and 
to discuss the hunger recently faced by the province. 
  The province is facing an acute hunger situation due to the 
failure of two consecutive crops. About 16 percent of its 
population is experiencing serious hunger. Among them, 34,000 
are ethnic minorities and 44,000 are people dependent on social 
welfare assistance in the coastal area. More than 70 percent of 
families in 11 of 44 villages inhabited by ethnic people face 
severe hunger. 
  To resolve this situation, Quang Tri Province has allotted 1 
billion dong from its reserve budget to buy seeds for 
distribution to the peasants to help them quickly engage in 
planting the summer-fall rice crop. The province also is 
striving to improve the irrigation system and encouraging the 
people to plant more subsidiary food crops to relieve the hunger 
situation. 
  Quang Tri Province requested that the government delegation 
consider an exemption of its agricultural tax and the 
postponement of its debt payment to the state bank during the 
winter-spring and summer-fall rice crops. It has also asked the 
government to provide help to relieve the hunger situation while 
distributing more seeds to the peasants to help them quickly 
engage in the planting of summer-fall and winter-spring rice 
crops.

  [Text] A major piece of good news has reached our entire 
party and people while we are preparing to celebrate the party's 
anniversary and the lunar New Year: The Midterm National Party 
Conference of Delegates (held from 20 to 25 January 1994 in 
Hanoi) has achieved fine success. With 647 delegates from 64 
party organizations directly subordinate to the central echelon 
in attendance and with the participation of the three comrade 
advisers to the party Central Committee, the conference 
discussed and made decisions on many important issues. The 
conference appraised the implementation of the seventh party 
congress Resolution in the first half-term, reviewed the 
renovation process since the sixth party congress, further 
clarified a number of important issues regarding lines and 
viewpoints in the process of advancing to socialism in our 
country, set forth major policies and solutions aimed at 
stepping up the implementation of the seventh party congress 
Resolution and continuing to advance the cause of renovation to 
even greater success. The conference also elected 20 additional 
members to the party Central Committee. 
  This is the first time that our party held a midterm 
conference of delegates in accordance with the new Party 
Statutes, showing a new work style in keeping with the 
democratic spirit. It can be said that holding a midterm 
conference is a mechanism designed to guarantee democratic 
activities, develop dynamism, and combat sluggishness within the 
party. 
  The conference observed that, since the seventh party 
congress, the world situation had undergone very rapid and and 
complex developments, and that once again our people's cause of 
national defense and socialist construction had to experience 
extremely severe--and at times dangerous--trials. But thanks to 
the party's correct leadership, the state's active management, 
and the entire people's all-out efforts, our country has 
overcome all difficulties and trials. To date, although there 
still remain numerous difficulties, shortcomings, and problems, 
we have overcome a very important stage of the socioeconomic 
crisis, have firmly maintained political stability, have 
consolidated national defense and security, have significantly 
broadened foreign relations, and have created the necessary 
premises for gradually shifting our country to a new 
period of development, the period of taking 
industrialization and national modernization one step forward. 
  These achievements prove that our party's renovation line is 
correct and our steps are appropriate. Our party and state have 
accumulated substantial experience in leading and guiding the 
building of socialism in our country. A profound lesson of 
experience for us is: We must firmly maintain the 
socialist orientation in the renovation process, must 
combine steadfast adherence to the revolutionary principles and 
strategies with tactical flexibility, and must promptly grasp 
the new. We must carry out renovation in a comprehensive and 
uniform manner, but there must be appropriate steps, 
forms, and methods. We must always firmly maintain the party's 
leadership and the state's management in the process of 
developing the multisectorial commodity economy and implementing 
socialist democracy; we must promptly detect and correctly 
resolve new problems, pay attention to reviewing practice, 
and ceaselessly refine the theory of socialist construction in 
our country. 
  To consolidate the achievements already recorded and 
gradually shift the country to a new period of development, the 
entire party and people should clearly recognize the situation 
and perceive all the achievements and difficulties, 
opportunities, and challenges. At present a major challenge is 
that the national economy is still very weak; moreover, it has 
to move forward in an environment of severe competition, 
therefore, it runs the risk of falling further behind 
neighboring countries, which in turn may lead to bad 
consequences for employment and the people's living standards, 
for the people's confidence in and support of the regime, and 
for our national defense and security capability. Meanwhile, 
hostile forces are still doing their utmost to carry out 
"peaceful evolution" to oppose and sabotage our people's 
revolutionary cause. Our party and state still have weak points 
and are not yet capable of fully meeting the requirements of the 
revolution; if they do not pay attention to overcoming 
deviations in guiding the implementation of their political 
program and line, they run the risk of deviating from the 
socialist direction. Corruption and bureaucratism remain very 
serious. 
  However, we have reason to believe that, with their 
indomitable tradition, our people, under the seasoned, 
experienced leadership of our party, will certainly uphold their 
self-reliant spirit, intelligence, and creativity; will surmount 
all trials; and will make the most of all opportunities to 
create historic turning points in national development. 
  Our country's important direction of development for the 
coming years, as clearly pointed out by the conference of 
delegates, focuses on the following vital domains: 
  -- Speed up the development of the economic structure 
along the line of national industrialization and 
modernization. This is aimed at creating many more jobs, 
accelerating the pace of growth, increasing labor productivity, 
enhancing socioeconomic efficiency, and improving the people's 
material and cultural life, thereby strengthening political 
stability; defending national independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity; and firmly maintaining the socialist 
orientation of development. This is really our country's 
strategic task of primary importance in the economic field. 
Today, we understand that industrialization does not mean only a 
simple increase in the pace and ratio of industrial production, 
but also a process of structural development linked with 
technological innovation aimed at laying the groundwork for a 
steady, highly efficient growth of the entire national economy. 
The party and state will carefully weigh and calculate the 
orientation, scale, and steps to ensure their compatibility with 
the needs and actual situation of the country. 
  -- Consistently implement the policy of multisectorial 
economy, create a moving force and environment even more 
conducive to a rapid and highly efficient development of various 
sectors and forms of business. Build and consolidate 
state-operated businesses in the key branches and areas so that 
they may assume the leading role and serve as the activists in 
guiding and helping other economic sectors develop in the right 
direction. Basically renovate the organization and management 
mechanism of state-operated businesses, implement various forms 
of corporatization, and profit sharing...in conformity with the 
nature and areas of production and business to attract more 
sources of capital, to create a moving force, to check 
negativism, and to prod state-operated businesses into operating 
for efficiently. 
  The cooperative, individual, small-proprietor, and private 
capitalist economic sectors and joint ventures with foreign 
countries should continue to be freed from illegal interdictions 
and prohibitions and from troublesome red tape so that they may 
develop even more strongly. On the other hand, the state should 
adopt measures to intensify inventory, control, guidance, and 
regulation to check and overcome the state of unlawful business 
operations, smuggling, tax evasion...which may lead to deviation 
from the party and state line. 
  -- Continue to renovate the management mechanism and to 
uniformly build the state-managed, socialist-oriented market 
mechanism. State management and regulation must encompass 
the entire economy and all economic sectors, not the state 
sector only. This must be reflected first of all in maintaining 
political stability and ensuring a peaceful environment for 
economic activities; in building the legal system and creating 
sufficient legal frameworks for economic operations; in 
developing strategies, projects, plans, long-term programs, and 
major equilibriums to orient socioeconomic development; in 
applying essential mechanisms and policies, especially in the 
fields of finance, pricing, information service, technological 
research and application... to guide and support the progress of 
economic activities in the right direction; in implementing an 
income regulation and distribution policy to ensure social 
justice; and in managing national property and resources and 
protecting and improving the ecological environment. 
  -- Devote oneself to cultural and social problems 
in order to care for, foster, and bring into play the human 
factor as both the moving force and the objective of the 
building of the new society. Pay special attention to the issues 
of employment, social justice, heightening the people's 
intellectual standard, making society healthy, and protecting 
and developing national cultural characteristics. Carry out the 
distribution of income according to labor as the main policy, 
treat talents fittingly; and at the same time, expand social 
welfare, take good care of those who have rendered services to 
the country, wipe out hunger and reduce poverty, and aid poor 
people and poor areas. 
  Resolutely and absolutely struggle against corruption and 
social evils in the entire administrative apparatus at all 
levels and in all sectors by means of a system of uniform 
measures; and combine immediate settlement and solutions with 
the prevention and radical resolution of these problems at their 
roots. 
  -- Ensure national defense and security and broaden 
foreign relations. Uphold vigilance, actively consolidate 
the political bases and movements for national security 
protection, build the people's security disposition and link it 
with the all-people national defense disposition. Strengthen the 
state management of public order and combat crime. Enhance the 
quality of the national defense and security forces' operations. 
  Continue to implement the foreign policy of independence, 
sovereignty, diversification, and multilateralization to create 
favorable conditions for the building of socialism and for 
national defense and, at the same time, to make positive 
contributions to the world people's common struggle for peace, 
national independence, democracy, and social progress. 
  -- Renovate the political system and enhance the 
party's leadership capability and fighting strength. Build 
and gradually perfect the rule-of-law state that is really of 
the people, by the people, and for the people; and manage all 
aspects of society by law and according to law. Adopt a 
mechanism to protect human rights and the bacic rights of 
citizens as stated in the Constitution. Establish social order 
and discipline, develop democracy in conjunction with struggling 
against manifestations of anarchy, the abuse of democracy to 
cause trouble and hurt public interest, and resolutely punish 
all sabotage and reactionary activities. 
  Broadly implement the policy of great national unity, rally 
all patriotic Vietnamese at home and abroad, and strive for a 
peaceful, unified, and independent Vietnam, for a prosperous 
people and a strong country, and for a just and civilized 
society. The Vietnam Fatherland Front and various political and 
social mass organizations should gear their activities toward 
these objectives. 
  Renovating and reorganizing the party to make its leadership 
quality and fighting strength equal to its tasks is a key issue 
ensuring that the renovation undertaking proceeds in the right 
direction and scores even greater achievements. It is necessary 
to continue implementing the Resolution of the Third Party 
Central Committee Plenum on Party Building. Pay special 
attention to consolidating ideological unity within the party 
and seriously implementing the principles guiding party 
organization and activities. Inculcate in cadres and party 
members the will to persist in the path to socialism, and 
creatively apply Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought; 
criticize and rectify deviationist viewpoints and ambiguous 
perceptions and overcome manifestations of opportunism, rightist 
deviationism, dogmatism, and conservatism. Radically renovate 
cadre work--especially the concepts and methods of evaluating, 
selecting, recruiting, and assigning cadres--along the line of 
true democracy and putting talents in important positions. At 
the same time, step up the reorganization of the apparatus, 
renovate the mode of leadership, and increase the fighting 
strength of the contingent of party members and grass-roots 
party organizations. 
  The decisions made by the national conference of delegates 
are the concretization, supplementation, and development of the 
seventh party congress Resolution. These decisions, which 
represent the crystallization of the entire party's intellect 
and the summing up and screening of realities, also contain the 
suggestions made by the people. Together with the other 
resolutions of the party Central Committee, they form the basis 
of our entire party's ideology, perception, and action; at the 
same time, they are the orientation of our country's advance. To 
enable the conference Resolution to penetrate life and be 
translated into reality, all party committee echelons and all 
cadres and party members should seriously and profoundly study 
and fully understand it in order to achieve the unity of 
perception, the unity of views, and the unity of action. All 
cadres and party members must talk and act in accordance with 
the party's resolutions. The state should promptly 
institutionalize the party's decisions, turning them into 
mechanisms, policies, and programs of action for the entire 
people to implement. On the occasion of the forthcoming midterm 
party conferences of delegates at various levels (from districts 
and precincts up), the party committee echelons should 
creatively apply the Resolution of the national party conference 
and various state policies and plans in order to set forth 
positions and solutions appropriate for their local situations, 
paying special attention to the key and urgent issues, and 
focusing guidance on implementing these positions and solutions 
in a resolute and efficient manner. 
  We are convinced that, with our entire party and people 
displaying singlemindedness, staying united, upholding their 
independent and self-reliant spirit, economically building the 
country, and striving to satisfactorily fulfilling the tasks set 
forth by the party conference of delegates, we will certainly be 
able to overcome all difficulties and trials and to continue 
advancing the cause of renovation to even greater success.

  [Text] In Hanoi, on the morning of 11 January 1994, the 
editorial staff of TAP CHI CONG SAN held a get-together with 
contributors (in the northern region). In attendance were 
Comrade Dao Duy Tung, member of the Political Bureau and 
standing member of the Secretariat of the Party Central 
Committee; Comrade Nguyen Duc Binh, member of the Political 
Bureau and secretary of the party Central Committee. Also on 
hand were comrade members of the party Central Committee: Ha 
Dang, director of the Ideology and Culture Department; Nguyen 
Dinh Huong, director of the Internal Political Security 
Department; Dang Xuan Ky, director of the Institute for Research 
on Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought; Nguyen Duy Quy, 
director of the National Center of Social Sciences and 
Humanities; Le Xuan Tung, deputy secretary of the Hanoi 
Municipal Party Committee; and many comrade leaders of other 
departments, ministries, branches, theoretical research organs, 
newspapers, and magazines.... 
  Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong, TAP CHI CONG SAN editor in chief, 
reported on the work of the journal in 1993 and its editorial 
direction in 1994. He stressed: In 1993, TAP CHI CONG SAN made 
significant progress in the editorial, research, public 
relations, printing, and distribution areas. Thanks to its 
attention to research, its linking editorial work with research, 
and its success in gathering large numbers of contributors, the 
journal was able to improve the quality of its copy and enhance 
its theoretical, recapitulative, and militant character. In 
particular, the journal paid attention to maintaining close 
contact with life and with burning theoretical and practical 
issues and propagandized various resolutions of the party 
Central Committee, the Political Bureau, and the Secretariat, 
and various major positions and policies of the party and state 
in a timely, concentrated, and systematic manner. It struggled 
in defense of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought and in 
defense of the party's lines and viewpoints, especially in the 
fight against "peaceful evolution," in the human rights issue, 
and in the culture, literature and arts, and publication issues. 
It criticized deviationist perceptions and erroneous viewpoints. 
  The limitations and weaknesses of TAP CHI CONG SAN are: the 
theoretical quality and scientific content of a number of 
articles are still poor; some articles still have the look of a 
specialized report or overemphasize local situations; the 
general character of its reviews of practice is not yet high 
enough and the style of writing is obsolete; and some articles 
are not convincing. 
  Concerning the editorial direction for 1994, the comrade 
editor in chief announced that the journal will deal more deeply 
with various theoretical issues of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi 
Minh thought and of socialism and the path to socialism in our 
country. It will attach special importance to reviews of 
practice and scientific studies and to articles aimed at 
combating erroneous viewpoints and rectifying erroneous 
perceptions. 
  In their suggestions, a number of contributors expressed 
their agreement with and approval of the editorial staff's 
report and welcomed and applauded the efforts, innovations, and 
progress of the journal. At the same time, they suggested 
additional measures aimed at continuing to improve the journal 
and to improve its quality. A number of comrades stressed that 
the switch to the market mechanism is both an objective demand 
and a move that has a direct impact on theoretical research work 
and on the press and publishing activities. Against this 
background, TAP CHI CONG SAN has stood firm in its position, has 
correctly performed its functions, has strictly adhered to its 
guiding principles, and has satisfactory carried out his task of 
determining the ideological orientation for all society. At the 
same time, it has striven to stay in contact with daily life and 
to touch upon not a few prominent, thorny issues. The journal 
has overcome the challenge and has recorded remarkable 
achievements. Its rich content and diversified, lively form have 
been reflected in all domains. The economic issue, a key, 
burning problem of society, has been satisfactorily dealt with. 
With regard to a number of difficult questions such as 
nationalities, religion, culture, literature and arts, the 
journal has also carried many articles containing correct 
viewpoints and written in an adequate style that are 
"acceptable" to society and the reader.... TAP CHI CONG SAN has 
increased its circulation of more than 38,000 copies (early in 
the year) to more than 42,000 copies (at year's end) and has 
successfully expanded its network of contributors and readership 
(particularly in the southern region). This is a fact worth 
rejoicing over. 
  A number of opinions suggested that TAP CHI CONG SAN should 
maintain the forms of exchange of views, informal talk, and 
seminar, especially concerning major, difficult issues, and 
should bring up different opinions and still controversial views 
to provide information and data so that the party can study them 
and plan policies. It can coordinate with various departments, 
sectors, or localities to organize seminars, thereby bringing 
theory into contact with vibrant life and, at the same time, 
enriching theory with the realities of life. 
  With a friendly and serious work style, TAP CHI CONG SAN 
was, 
is, and will be the rallying point of scientists, theoreticians, 
and activists, and will become an important bridge between 
science and life, between scientists and the public at large. 
The journal's appeal lies primarily in the quality of its copy. 
In the past, readers might come to TAP CHI CONG SAN simply 
because they needed or had to understand the party's policies 
and lines. Today, in the information age, readers come to the 
journal with much more diversified, variegated needs and 
aspirations. In particular, they want to find correct answers 
for and solutions to the bustling, complex life of today. 
  Many contributors expressed their belief that, as a 
theoretical and political organs of the party Central Committee 
and with its substantial experience and its strong contingent of 
contributors, TAP CHI CONG SAN will certainly continue to 
advance to satisfactorily fulfill the tasks entrusted to it, 
thereby living up to its readers' confidence. 
  After listening to the aforementioned opinions, Comrade Dao 
Duy Tung made a statement. With his familiar composed, friendly 
manner and his simple, incisive way of expression, he said: "A 
former cadre of TAP CHI CONG SAN who had worked for it for 17 
years, from 1965 to 1982 [Footnote: Comrade Dao Duy Tung was 
editor in chief of TAP CHI CONG SAN from 1965 to 1982 -- 
(P.V.)], today I am very happy to see the brothers and sisters 
who work at the journal, and to see the contributors, some of 
whom have contributed since the years I still worked at the 
journal." 
  Commending the progress made by TAP CHI CONG SAN last year 
in 
the content and quality of its copy, in the intellectual content 
of the journal, in the renovation of its way of thinking, in the 
scope of the issues dealt with, and in the educational standard 
of its writers, Comrade Dao Duy Tung clearly pointed out: TAP 
CHI CONG SAN has paid attention to linking theory with life and 
has consciously explained and answered the problems posed by 
life. Although the quality of its answers is still debatable, 
the journal has made efforts in this respect, and this is the 
right direction to follow. The comrade stressed: "Obviously, TAP 
CHI CONG SAN has made progress in all its content, its form, and 
its contingent of contributors." 
  Pointing to the weak aspects of the journal, Comrade Dao Duy 
Tung made suggestions concerning some issues: In its capacity as 
the theoretical and political organ of the party Central 
Committee, how many articles of good quality and significant 
scope has TAP CHI CONG SAN produced by itself, articles that are 
considered interesting by many people? Has the journal delved 
deeply into the reality of renovation--from the micro to the 
macro level--in order to present concrete models in various 
domains (especially the economic domain) of the path of 
socialist construction in our country? Has it carried highly 
scientific and convincing articles to contribute to heightening 
the confidence of cadres and party members in the path they have 
chosen, and to overcome the vacillation among a component of 
cadres and party members in the face of the collapse of the 
socialist system in the Soviet Union and East European 
countries? How many articles has it featured that have the 
effect of guiding various echelons and sectors in correctly 
implementing the party's common line, and of promptly rectifying 
the manifestations of deviationism? Everyday, every hour, the 
opposition forces, using many means, are constantly striking at 
the ideological base of the party and at the party itself. Have 
the articles on this issue launched timely and effective 
counterattacks? 
  With regard to the editorial orientation and tasks of TAP 
CHI 
CONG SAN in the coming years, Comrade Dao Duy Tung clearly 
pointed out: 
  1. The journal should assert, clarify, and help develop 
Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh thought. This is an important 
and pressing task. At present, the Council for the 
Guidance of the Compilation of the Textbooks of the Scientific 
Studies of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought is 
holding discussions to clarify a number of major theoretical 
issues such as: the role of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh 
thought; observations on the character and content of our epoch; 
the theory of socioeconomic forms; the theory of surplus value; 
the theory of the historical position of the working class; and 
many other concrete issues. 
  The general issue is that we must be able to determine what 
universal principles of Marxism-Leninism as a revolutionary and 
scientific doctrine were correct in the past and are still 
correct at present; what theses conformed to historical 
conditions in the past but are no longer appropriate now; and 
what theses were already inappropriate even during the lifetime 
of Marx and Lenin, including the ones that had been criticized 
by Marx and Lenin themselves. We must consider what 
contributions our party has made to the development of 
Marxism-Leninism in the process of leading the revolution. 
  This is an opportunity for TAP CHI CONG SAN to make 
important 
contributions to and to work together with the council to 
clarify theoretical issues. The journal should establish close 
relations with the council to secure more favorable conditions 
for its editorial work. 
  2. TAP CHI CONG SAN should actively participate in the 
research on and compilation of articles aimed at providing a 
scientific basis for the decisions of the Seventh and Eighth 
Party Central Committee Plenums and the eighth party congress. 
The Seventh Party Central Committee Plenum will discuss the 
industrialization issue, science and technology, and development 
of the working class. The Eighth Party Central Committee Plenum 
will discuss the rule-of-law state issue, social sciences and 
the humanities, and some theoretical issues. The journal should 
closely monitor the requirements and themes being prepared for 
submission to these plenums in order to formulate appropriate 
editorial programs. 
  3. The journal should closely follow the implementation of 
the seventh party congress Resolution, the Resolution of the 
party conference of delegates, and the various party Central 
Committee resolutions. It should grasp important socioeconomic 
issues in order to write articles to affirm what is proceeding 
in the right direction and what is deviating from it. 
  With regard to the economy, the journal should carry 
articles 
on economic structure, economic sectors, the market mechanism, 
especially the issue of state-run businesses, the forms of 
cooperatives in several sectors, private businesses, pricing, 
banking, money, accumulation, consumption.... Concerning 
society, the journal should pay attention to the questions of 
employment, social justice, elimination of hunger and reduction 
of poverty, division between the rich and the poor.... 
  Special importance should be attached to articles reviewing 
models, in particular the models of production centers (such as 
tea, sugarcane, mulberry and silkworm, coffee, rubber production 
centers...); attention should be focused on models of 
state-operate businesses and of distribution and circulation in 
the new conditions; on models of agricultural cooperatives to be 
built along the line of bringing into full play the strengths of 
cooperative member households while consolidating and increasing 
the strength of the collective of cooperative members.... 
  4. TAP CHI CONG SAN should delve more deeply into the issues 
of national culture and characteristics and fine national 
traditions. It should exploit the achievements of our 
forefathers, not only in the domain of fighting against 
aggressors but also in other fields such as philosophy, history, 
science, literature and arts, religion, law, language... 
  5. TAP CHI CONG SAN has carried, at an early date, articles 
dealing with the issue of opposing "peaceful evolution" (issue 
No. 1-1993). But now it should delve more deeply into this 
matter because this struggle is taking place everyday, every 
hour, in many fairly virulent forms. 
  6. Concerning the party, articles in TAP CHI CONG SAN should 
clearly show that party building is the key task. There are many 
subjects, but in the immediate future importance should be 
attached to the question of heightening the vanguard character 
and raising the party's standards and intellect. The journal 
should carry articles written in an attractive, persuasive 
manner to contribute to developing the quality of cadres and 
party members, upholding the revolutionary ideal, promoting a 
healthy way of living, and overcoming the manifestations of 
vacillation and opportunism. In particular the journal must 
struggle against corruption, smuggling, and wasteful 
expenditures. 
  In the current complicated situation, TAP CHI CONG SAN 
should 
feature convincing articles to struggle against and refute 
allegations against the party (allegations aimed at opposing the 
party's ideological system, the party's line, and party 
organizations; and at enticing, winning over, and corrupting 
party cadres...). The journal must attach special importance to 
the subjects concerning the cadre issue in order to gradually 
improve the quality of our contingent of cadres. 
  Comrade Dao Duy Tung concluded: "In short, we must firmly 
grasp opportunities, bring into play our advantages, and prevent 
and overcome dangers in order to achieve at all costs the 
objectives set by the seventh party congress, not only for up to 
1995 but also for up to 2000." 
  On behalf of the editorial staff and the contingent of 
contributors, Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong sincerely thanked Comrade 
Dao Duy Tung and promised the party Central Committee that they 
will satisfactorily carry out the tasks of the journal.

philosophy] 
  [Text] From the lesson of the failure of restructuring in 
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, from the experience of 
reform in China, and from the realities of renovation in our 
country over the past seven years, we can affirm that: it 
is imperative to firmly maintain political stability if society 
is to be renovated. Politics touches particularly complex 
and sensitive social relationships of which class relationship 
is the core. Politics is the relationships among social classes 
and groups in the competition for and the maintenance and use of 
state power. Therefore, touching politics is touching the state, 
the social system, the survival of the social system. 
Concentration on renovation is possible only if there is 
political stability; if there is no political stability, nothing 
can be done. For this reason, political stability is the basis 
for social stability in general; political 
instability is likely to result in instability in other areas of 
society. 
  Two forms of political stability can be seen in 
reality. There is a form of stability that is synonymous with 
sluggishness and nondevelopment. Naturally, such stability can 
hardly last; very often it becomes the cause of instability 
later on. The form of stability we would like to talk about here 
is the one linked with development, the form of stability with 
development and for development. This stability is not a purpose 
in itself; on the contrary, this stability is only a condition, 
and it is development that is the purpose. In this sense, 
political stability becomes an indispensable condition for 
and factor of development. 
  Political stability is not in opposition to political 
renovation. Therefore, we should not fear political renovation 
because of our desire for political stability. To carry out 
political renovation we must achieve political stability, but to 
achieve basic, lasting sociopolitical stability, political 
renovation must be carried out in the right direction and in an 
efficient manner. Stability must be achieved by means of 
renovation and through renovation. So, political stability is 
both a precondition for and a result of political 
renovation. Political stability is dialectically 
unified with political renovation; in stability there is 
renovation, and in renovation there is stability. Thus, 
political stability implies alteration and change, but such 
alteration and change must be in harmony with the set 
socioeconomic development objectives instead of running counter 
to it, and basically must be controlled by the leading and 
managing subjects, namely the party and state. It can be said 
that, political stability is political renovation carried out in 
a principled manner and in conformity with our party's 
renovative line. 
  According to the aforementioned concept, the task of firmly 
maintaining political stability in order to renovate politics 
and other aspects implies the following basic factors: 
  -- Firmly maintaining the party's right to leadership over 
the political system and all society. This means that the party 
must really holds power and its objectives, viewpoints, and 
principles must be thoroughly reflected in its renovative line. 
  -- Firmly maintaining the political system with the state 
apparatus as a state of the people, by the people, and for the 
people. Although the organizational structure and personnel of 
the state may change, the political character of our state must 
not be changed. 
  -- Firmly maintaining our legal system. Laws may be revised, 
amended, and refined, but their class nature and their focus on 
the people's interest must not be altered. This legal system 
compels all citizens, including cadres, party members, power 
holders, and party and state organizations to abide by the law. 
  Over the past years we have recorded very important 
initial achievements in firmly maintaining political stability 
and renovating the political system in an extremely complex 
international and domestic situation resulting from the collapse 
of the socialist system in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, 
from the intensification of domestic hostile forces' scheme of 
sabotaging our regime, and from the socioeconomic difficulties 
which became severe at times. The successful maintenance 
of political stability, as it was done in the recent past, 
has become a prerequisite for ensuring the success of 
the renovation undertaking. Political stability is also a very 
basic factor in broadening international relations and 
attracting foreign capital investment. Political stability has 
contributed to checking the drop in public confidence in the 
party and state. 
  Looking back at the past few years, we can see that our 
political system has taken a step in renovating the organization 
and mode of operation of the party and state. The sociopolitical 
organizations have developed in a more diversified manner, and 
their social character and initiative have been enhanced. A 
democratization process has been initiated within the party and 
in society at large, and democracy has developed further in the 
economic, political, cultural, and ideological fields. The roles 
of the National Assembly, the mass organizations, and the mass 
media have grown markedly. 
  These achievements would have been impossible if there had 
been no achievements in economic renovation. Recent economic 
renovation has been the most outstanding achievement of all, and 
it is due to economic renovation that political stability has 
been maintained and the political system has been renovated in 
accordance with the demand of economic development. 
  However, the achievements in maintaining political stability 
and in renovating the political system are attributable not only 
to economic renovation but also to other important factors such 
as: 
  -- The roles of various elements in the political system, 
especially the role of the party. Our party has been able to set 
forth at an early date a correct renovative line that conforms 
to objective realities and responds to the masses' aspirations, 
and has known how to carry out renovation in a principled manner 
and through appropriate steps. 
  -- Our people and nation, with their tradition of following 
the party, have voluntarily accepted the party leadership 
because they do not want to lose political stability and do not 
want to see the social system collapse. All our people want 
political stability so that they can "earn their living," 
develop the economy, and raise their living standards. They do 
not want political pluralism and multiparty opposition, which 
will only cause social chaos. 
  -- Our army and security forces, which are always loyal to 
the party and the people and have considerable experience in 
defending the fatherland and in firmly maintaining political 
security and social order and safety, have actively and 
effectively opposed the "peaceful evolution" scheme of the 
hostile forces. 
  However, next to the achievements already recorded, there 
remain numerous problems that we must continue to resolve. 
Specifically, they are the following: 
  -- Recently, our economic renovation undertaking has only 
recorded initial achievements, and the market economy mechanism 
has just begun to take shape. There has been considerable 
confusion in determining the socialist orientation in the 
conditions of market economy, and both the theoretical and 
practical aspects of this issue have not yet been clarified. 
Development of the market economy and multisectorial economy has 
inevitably altered the social and class structure and, through 
this, will affect the political system and may cause new 
complications in the political domain. In addition, the hostile 
forces are taking advantage of our economic and cultural 
open-door policy to carry out sabotage with the aim of causing 
political instability and eventually changing the political 
direction. 
  -- The regulatory and managerial capability of our state in 
the market economic is still weak, which may easily lead to 
chaos and confusion in the economy and society and violations of 
the law and morality (such as the phenomena of tax evasion, 
counterfeiting, corruption, smuggling, and so forth...). This is 
a favorable environment for speculators to collude with 
degenerate and deviant persons in various state agencies, and 
this is the chief, direct cause of corruption and smuggling. 
  -- A section of the people, including cadres and party 
members, and especially the youth, still vacillate in their 
faith and their socialist ideal, and in their confidence in the 
socialist path. 
  -- The renovation of organization and of the mode of 
operation of the party, the state, and the various mass 
organization is still ineffective. Renovation of the political 
system is not yet really commensurate with economic renovation, 
particularly with regard to organization and the management 
apparatus. The state machinery remains bulky and bureaucratic 
and has not yet been reformed to any appreciable extent. The 
legal system is still deficient and lacks uniformity, the 
effectiveness of laws and regulations remains low, and laws and 
social order and discipline are still being seriously violated. 
  The party's activities in the market mechanism still show no 
little confusion. Many problems concerning the building of the 
rule-of-law state remain unclarified. An operational mechanism 
ensuring the unification of power while effecting a division of 
labor and responsibility among the legislative, executive, and 
judiciary organs in the conditions of market economy has not yet 
been clearly established. 
  -- There have appeared a number of factors that may cause 
political instability: the activities of "peaceful evolution," 
sabotage, violence, and subversion of reactionaries at home and 
abroad. Although these factors have not yet led to political 
conflict, they should not be lightly dismissed; on the contrary, 
we must fully perceive their complexity, dangers, and 
consequences at an early date in order to take active measures 
to guard against, prevent, and overcome them. 
  From the realities of firmly maintaining political stability 
and renovating the political system over the past years we can 
draw a number of conclusions as follows: 
  1. Resolutely and firmly maintain and renovate the 
party leadership and do not accept political pluralism and 
multiparty opposition. Recognizing political pluralism and 
multiparty opposition is tantamount to creating proper 
conditions for the enemies of the class to rear their heads and 
to contend with our party for the right to leadership, thereby 
causing political instability and sabotaging and toppling our 
regime. 
  2. Correctly combine economic renovation and political 
renovation, using economic renovation as the basis and 
political renovation as the key link. When we say using economic 
renovation as the basis we mean that political renovation must 
proceed from the economy and in accordance with the demand of 
economic development. However, this does not mean that political 
renovation is dependent on economic renovation in a mechanical, 
totally passive manner as "the tail" of economic renovation; on 
the contrary, politics must play an active role 
because it is a subjective factor. When resolving economic 
issues we should have correct political viewpoints. Therefore, 
to carry out economic renovation there must be at least some 
political renovation and some renovation of the economic 
thinking among the basic elements of the the political system, 
namely the party and state. For this reason, economic renovation 
is possible only if there is a gradual political renovation; we 
must take the initiative in gradually unscrambling 
each link of the political system to create proper conditions 
for economic renovation. For this reason, Lenin on the one hand 
regarded politics as the concentrated manifestation of economy 
and on the other hand held that politics must take precedence 
over economy. 
  3. Continue to consider economic renovation to be the 
focal point, actively develop the economy, and resolve the 
pressing problems concerning the people's living standards. 
Through this effort we must continue to restore the people's 
confidence in the party and to unravel psychological and 
ideological entanglements. 
  4. Resolve social problems to create a wholesome social 
environment for political stability and renovation. To this 
aim, we must resolve the burning issues; for example, we must 
effectively combat corruption and smuggling, struggle against 
obnoxious cultural products coming from abroad to cause moral 
"pollution," reduce social injustice, create many more jobs for 
the people, limit the division between the rich and the poor, 
and satisfactorily resolve the land issue in the countryside to 
avoid turning it into a "hot point" likely to cause social 
explosions. We must heighten vigilance against the "peaceful 
evolution" scheme and resolutely suppress sabotage, rebellious, 
and subversive activities of the reactionaries at home and 
abroad.

  [Text] 1. Over the past years, our party and state have 
adopted the policy of combining security and national defense, 
security and economy, and security and culture and ideology, and 
have made a number of important decisions. Worthy of note are 
Directive 15 of the Political Bureau and Decision 114 of the 
government prime minister. In certain aspects, the 
implementation of these directives and decisions has yielded 
some definite results and has contributed to further overcoming 
the socioeconomic crisis, firmly maintaining and consolidating 
political stability, and creating the necessary premises for 
gradually shifting our country to a new period of development. 
  However, these combining efforts have been uneven and have 
not been well-coordinated and actively mutually supportive; in 
some places and at times they have been separated from one 
another and, worse still, have been conflicting, thereby 
limiting economic growth and political stability. This situation 
has many causes, among them those concerning perception and 
thinking and those concerning the management mechanism. In the 
conditions of the new having not yet definitely emerged and the 
old having not been completely abolished, it is difficult to 
avoid the problem that the perception and thinking of many 
people remain unclear and somewhat deviationist, in particular 
the tendency to run after economic gains, thereby loosening 
security and losing vigilance. Within the mechanism itself there 
remain numerous loopholes that are reflected in policies, laws 
and regulations, and organization of implementation--loopholes 
that criminal elements may exploit to sabotage us economically. 
  In the first six months of 1993--if we count of cases that 
have been detected only (the number of which is still far too 
low compared to reality)--there were nearly 1,700 violations of 
socialist property causing the loss of almost 185 billion dong, 
among them more than 530 cases of corruption causing the loss of 
nearly 167 billion dong. These figures represent a fairly marked 
increase over the first six months of 1992 (during which there 
were 341 cases of corruption causing the loss of 53.54 billion 
dong). Not only has the scourge of corruption been 
unstoppable but it has also increased, with the number of 
corruption cases going up with each passing day and the losses 
becoming increasingly greater. Corruption has occurred fairly 
frequently in many sophisticated forms in many key economic 
sectors, with the crime of intentionally committing 
wrongdoings to embezzle public property being the most 
prominent offense. Taking advantage of those areas where there 
are foreign investment, the administrations of a number of 
localities have arbitrarily sold land illegally, have even sold 
standing trees in the forests, have unlawfully exported precious 
timber, and have been "liberal" to the point of voluntarily 
working without pay for foreign countries and allowing them to 
freely exploit their precious, rare assets right in their own 
land. Many agencies and enterprises have asked to be allocated 
land for the purposes of building factories and offices, but in 
fact have traded it for profit. Numerous traders and even a 
number of Vietnamese joint ventures having the legal status of a 
corporate body have used the money of foreign businessmen or 
companies to deal in real state. Sales of land, forests, and sea 
areas have been reported. 
  Smuggling has continued to develop in a complex and serious 
manner in all communications lines: land routes, see routes, and 
air routes, and along the northern and southwestern borders. 
Also in the first six months of 1993 alone, we had detected and 
dealt with more than 11,000 cases of smuggling, trading of 
forbidden goods, illegal business operations, and tax evasion, 
and have confiscated goods worth more than 188 billion dong. 
Compared to the first six months of 1992 (during which more than 
4,000 cases were uncovered and more than 71-billion dong worth 
of goods confiscated), it is obvious that far from 
decreasing, snuggling has in fact increased two-fold. 
  2. Along with the domestic economic achievements, our 
external economic activities have been broadened and 
relations in many forms have been established with numerous 
foreign partners to help the economy overcome severe trials 
after the (former) Soviet Union stopped giving aid and 
unexpectedly reduced its economic and trade relations with us. 
However, its has become increasingly clear that, besides the 
positive aspects, our open-door policy has also resulted in no 
little negativism that has caused difficult and complex problems 
concerning political security and has further polluted the 
cultural and social environment. Besides the numerous cases in 
which we have suffered losses and disadvantages in our economic 
relations with the outside world, corruption and smuggling have 
also occurred frequently in our external economic activities. We 
have uncovered a number of international smuggling channels 
operated by some foreign traders or organizations acting in 
collusion with various local economic organizations and 
management and control organs to bring in contraband or to use 
Vietnamese territory as a transit center for contraband 
including narcotic drugs, as Interpol has notified us. Aside 
from the fraudulent acts of a number of foreign companies and 
businessmen, there have been "mistakes" with regard to the 
prices and quality of a fairly large amount of machinery and 
equipment imported by none other than our state organs. To date 
we are still unable to inventory the cases of external economic 
activities resulting in disclosure of national secrets. 
  3. With the very important achievements it has recorded over 
the past seven years, our country is becoming an investment hot 
point to the capitalist countries. These countries consider 
Vietnam to be a market with the purchasing power of 70 million 
people, with abundant resources, with skilled and cheap labor, 
and with a stable political environment. 
  We are being faced with both new opportunities and new 
challenges. The new opportunities lie in the fact that we have 
new conditions for using--in the position of an independent, and 
unified nation with a stable political system--the considerable 
power sources of our country in terms of labor and people, 
natural resources and geographical position, market potential 
and the advantage of a country marching behind others, thereby 
benefiting from the experiences of the countries ahead of it. If 
we know how to satisfactorily exploit these factors, we will 
certainly be able to attract the outside world in our economic 
relations with it, and at the same time to obtain capital and 
modern science and technology along with experience in market 
economy management. 
  In the immediate future, however, we still have to surmount 
many big challenges. Although our national economy enjoys a 
fairly high growth rate, this growth is not yet steady, and many 
mishaps may still occur. Our capital, meager as it is, has been 
further affected by serious corruption and smuggling, while many 
sectors, echelons, localities, and units and many leading and 
managing cadres have spent more than they could afford to, have 
squandered money, and have allowed serious losses of public 
property to occur. Corruption and smuggling alone already 
constitute a big challenge to the economy, not to mention the 
damage they cause to public order and security, the ideology, 
culture, and society. 
  Our national economy has had to enter the race with the 
world 
and the region in the conditions of a very low starting point; 
moreover, it has not yet extricated itself from its crisis. 
Although we have shifted to the market mechanism only recently, 
we have to struggle for a foothold in the world market in highly 
unfavorable conditions: we lack knowledge and experience in 
competition; price differences are unfavorable; the world 
economy is in the grip of a recession and crisis and fraught 
with uncertainty.... This is not to mention the fact that we 
might make mistakes leading to deviation from the socialist 
orientation. Looking at the objective aspect alone, we can see 
that in the renovation process, owing to the change of the model 
of organization of socioeconomic life--from the old 
model full of errors to a new one that has never 
existed before in history--it is inevitable that micro and macro 
contradictions will crop up. 
  4. Meanwhile, the hostile forces have ceaselessly carried 
out 
the "peaceful evolution" strategy in new forms; if an 
opportunity presents itself, they will not hesitate to use 
violence to intervene from outside with the aim of abolishing 
socialism in our country or steering our country into their 
orbit. 
  To carry out "peaceful evolution" in the conditions of the 
United States lifting its embargo against and normalizing 
relations with our country, the hostile forces will surely 
concentrate on their two familiar trump cards: democracy, 
human rights and the free market. These two 
cards are bound to each other. Under the "democracy, human 
rights" label, they will make the most the forms of overt, legal 
activities to extol bourgeois freedom, to gather and disseminate 
information, to establish contact with their former agents and 
to incite extremist elements among the various ethnic minorities 
and religions to create forces opposed to our party and state. 
But what they pay special attention to is to incite, divide, and 
split our internal ranks, to strive to win over those persons 
who hold erroneous viewpoints, who are degenerate and deviant, 
and who demand political pluralism and multiparty opposition. 
  A primary, direct thrust by the hostile forces against the 
socioeconomic development line and process in our country in 
their "peaceful evolution" strategy is to take advantage of the 
investment and economic cooperation channel to promote the 
capitalist free market. They hope that when the private economic 
sector (including foreign capitalists investing in Vietnam) 
accounts for a significant proportion of our national economy 
and becomes a strong economic force, it may be able to bring 
pressure to bear to have our line altered. The economic change 
that would result in political change is to be reflected in the 
following points: 
  -- Through economic activities, they will seek to create 
sociopolitical bases, specifically to create class bases, social 
strata, a social ideology and psychology, and a social way of 
living in accordance with their intention. 
  -- Through various forms of technological transfer, 
international trade... they will keep our national economy in a 
backward, dependent state. (Of course, not all activities of 
economic cooperation and association of the outside world with 
us lie in the "peaceful evolution" channel, but reality has 
shown that such activities are not rare). 
  -- Through various forms such as study, seminars, exchanges 
of experience, and so forth...they will try to gradually modify 
our ways of organizing economic management and training our 
contingent of business management personnel in accordance with 
their models. Reality has shown that the study of and reference 
to the management experiences of the outside world through 
seminars, "refresher" courses, short-term training classes...are 
very necessary and useful to us, but they also represent golden 
opportunities for hostile forces to exploit our secrets for 
economic purposes--namely to gain high profits--and also for 
political purposes, a possibility that cannot be ruled out. 
  -- Through investment, aid, and loans... they will bring 
political pressure to bear and meddle in our country's internal 
affairs. In fact, a western statesman once said: "We have no 
blank checks. Economic aid depends on the progress of political 
democratization." 
  5. To firmly defend security in the conditions of an open 
economy, given our country's characteristics and specific 
situation at present, several different measures should be 
adopted and uniformly implemented. 
  In the ideological and political domain, we should 
see to it that all citizens, first of all the contingent of 
cadres and party members, in particular the contingent of cadres 
in charge of economic management and foreign relations, clearly 
perceive the new opportunities and advantages and even the new 
challenges and dangers. We should arouse patriotism and national 
pride, blot out the shame of hunger and poverty, rid ourselves 
of complexes and rancor, and show unity of will and 
singlemindedness in striving to achieve the goal of "making the 
people rich, the country strong, and society just and 
civilized." We must strongly promote theoretical research and 
the review of practice, attach special importance to burning 
issues that need to be resolved to put the people's hearts at 
ease and to achieve the unity of thought and action. These are 
very basic issues, such as: concretizing the socialist 
orientation; relations between socialist construction and 
national defense, between the class and the nation, and between 
the state and the international community; resolving the 
relations between economy and politics in in the socialist 
market mechanism; the polarization of the rich and the poor, 
class division, the current ideological trends, and so forth.... 
  It is true that a general model is not available yet, and 
the 
picture still remains an initial rough sketch; but, anyway, 
since we have embarked on renovation for seven years, if we pay 
attention to reviewing our practical activities, we may be able 
to begin resolving a number of issues. 
  We must continue to renovate the party's organization 
and operations. Since the sixth party congress, and 
particularly since the seventh party congress, it has become 
increasingly clear that stability is a condition for renovation, 
and fruitful renovation will in turn consolidate stability. If 
economic achievements create proper conditions for consolidating 
political stability, then political stability is the basis for 
renovation to record economic achievements. In a certain sense, 
economic renovation also means political renovation (renovation 
of line, policy, management mechanism). The party's strength and 
capability manifest themselves first of all in the drawing up of 
its political program and in determining the right direction for 
national development. At present, we should clarify the 
socialist orientation and, at the same time, develop the theory 
of socialism in Vietnam. Although we cannot demand that a full 
picture of the models of socialism be completed at once, we 
should nevertheless gradually explain the theoretical issues of 
socialism in the conditions of renovation. To continue carrying 
out the renovation undertaking, the party and state should show 
high resolve in purifying the contingent of cadres and party 
members, in particular key cadres--both incumbent and 
next-in-line--and should consider this the most important issue 
at present. 
  With regard to the struggle against corruption in 
particular, 
we should make public the assets of cadres, in particular 
high-ranking cadres from the provincial echelon up, especially 
in the economic and law-enforcement sectors (the public 
security, the courts, the organs of control, the customs...). 
The struggle against corruption and smuggling must be waged from 
top to bottom, from the party committee echelons to party 
members. Important court cases should be definitely tried by the 
law and should not be settled as internal matters. Lawbreakers 
must be severely punished; the failure to match words with deeds 
and the practice of making severe threats but meting out light 
penalties..., which have damaged the prestige of the party and 
state, must be ended forthwith. 
  We must increase the effectiveness of state management 
and ensure that economic development goes hand in glove with the 
maintenance of order and security. In the current first 
stage, increasing the effectiveness of state management and 
preventing, overcoming, and limiting the negative effects of the 
mechanism-changeover period and of the market mechanism itself 
is an urgent matter. The state should concentrate on 
satisfactorily performing its macroeconomic management 
functions. Specifically, these functions are: 
  -- Perfecting the legal system and creating all the 
necessary, stable, and consistent legal frameworks for economic 
activities on the basis of the market and the open-door policy 
toward the outside world. The state should clearly define what 
may not be done and what may be done only with permission, 
thereby creating a corridor of free enterprise in accordance 
with the law for businesses and citizens. In the immediate 
future, it should promulgate various laws along the line of 
encouraging investment for development while limiting and 
prevent social injustices, for example: the labor law, the wages 
law, the insurance law, the law on taxation and income 
regulation.... All production and business operations of various 
units of all economic sectors, including foreign-owed businesses 
in our countries, must be conducted in strict accordance with 
the law. At the same time, law-enforcement organs must strictly 
abide by the law; only by observing the law in an exemplary 
manner themselves will they be able to maintain the 
effectiveness of the law vis-a-vis all units and individuals. 
  -- Renovating and strengthening the executive system in all 
the three domains of organization, personnel, and operational 
mechanism. The executive system should be managed in a unified, 
concentrated, uninterrupted, and highly efficient manner. There 
should be a clear-cut division of labor among all the three 
powers--legislative, judiciary, and executive--from the central 
to the local echelons, and their effectiveness should be brought 
into full play. Laws are made for the whole country; the local 
administrations must really fulfill their responsibilities on 
the basis of the unified legal system and the centralized 
management of the government, thereby avoiding the state of each 
sector and each locality acting as a "little king" or a 
"warlord" and disregarding the law of the land. 
  -- A very important force for the state to use in 
strengthening management in this respect is the public security, 
the organs of control, and the courts, which are the ones who 
directly maintain nationals security and ensure socioeconomic 
stability and development on behalf of the state. These 
protective forces should be better equipped in terms of both 
perception and material means in order to bring into full play 
the strength of their individual organizations and to promote 
close cooperation with one another. 
  -- Continuing to renovate, perfect, and uniformly implement 
various social policies such as those aimed at creating jobs, 
wiping our hunger and reducing poverty, providing social 
welfare, suppressing outmoded customs and social evils... These 
are both short-term and long-term policies designed to prevent 
crime and to ensure that economic growth is closely linked with 
social progress and justice. Successfully ensuring social 
justice at a definite level is ensuring order and security. In 
this spirit, the law must severely punish all acts of enriching 
oneself unlawfully and must prevent people from enriching 
themselves by means of excessive and unethical exploitation and 
by impoverishing laborers. This is the most important point in 
the relationship between economic growth and the maintenance of 
order and security. 
  We must develop external economic relations in the 
right direction. At present our advance is gaining 
momentum, at the same time we have also come under pressure from 
many directions. In such conditions, our external relations 
activities should concentrate on serving our legitimate national 
interest, namely making the people prosperous and the country 
strong, peaceful, independent, and marked by social progress. 
Unlike in past times, today the hostile forces have many means 
by which to influence our country with the aim of driving us 
onto the capitalist road or steering us into their orbit, thus 
making us dependent on them. For this reason, external relations 
activities should hold fast to the two aspects of cooperation 
and struggle in order to develop and protect the economy, to 
defend national security, and to preserve and develop the 
national cultural traditions and characteristics. We protect our 
national security (including political security, economic 
security, cultural security, and social security) by renovating 
our mode of operation, effectively meeting the requirements of 
economic development, and creating favorable conditions for 
external economic activities.

  [Text] On 20-21 May 1994, U.S. Assistant Secretary of 
State Winston Lord on behalf of the U.S. Government and Deputy 
Foreign Minister Le Mai on behalf of the SRV Government 
exchanged letters of agreement on the establishment of liaison 
offices in the capitals of the two countries. 
  According to the agreement, the initial form of official 
representation of Vietnam in the United States and of the United 
States in Vietnam will be liaison offices, and the heads of 
these offices will be called head of the liaison office. The 
two offices will work within the framework of the 1963 Vienna 
Convention on Consular Relations, to which both sides are 
signatories. 
  The opening of liaison offices in the capitals of the two 
countries marks an important developmental step on the path to 
the normalization of relations between Vietnam and the United 
States, thus creating favorable conditions for the two 
governments to continue to resolve issues of common concern and 
meeting the interests of the two peoples and the interests of 
peace, stability, and development in the region.

  [Text] Dear friends: As previously reported, the party 
Central Committee Secretariat held a conference in Hanoi from 
21-23 May to review the implementation over the past two years 
of the party Central Committee's third plenum resolution on 
party renovation and rectification as well as some urgent issues 
in our work relating to female cadres. 
  Comrade Le Phuoc Tho, member of the Political Bureau, 
secretary of the party Central Committee, and head of the party 
Central Committee's Organization Department, chaired the 
conference, which was attended by nearly 500 delegates from 53 
provinces and cities and various ministries and sectors. 
Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi attended and addressed the 
conference. 
  We invite our friends to listen to this report by a Radio 
Voice of Vietnam correspondent outlining the main points of the 
conference: 
  [Begin recording] Dear friends: It has been two years since 
the party Central Committee's third plenum resolution and nearly 
10 years since the party Central Committee Secretariat's 
directive on a number of urgent matters relating to female 
cadres. 
  Le Huy Ngo, deputy head of the party Central Committee's 
Organization Department, presented a report reviewing the 
party's renovation and rectification over the past two years. 
The report mentioned the situation regarding the deployment and 
implementation of this resolution and pointed out that in 
general the party's renovation and rectification efforts have 
correctly met the everyone's aspirations because attention has 
been given by the entire party, people, and Army. 
  Party activities in various establishments have attracted 
participation by 80-90 percent of party members. These 
activities reflect unanimity in policies and great effort in 
activities. They have produced a number of initial yet 
important results in certain respects and have won the sympathy 
and support of the people. These results are: 
  1. Ideologically, we have been able to further consolidate 
our unity of mind and improve the confidence of a large number 
of party cadres and members and people regarding the party's 
renovation stance. On this basis, we have improved the sense of 
responsibility of party committee echelons and every party 
member toward the implementation of the party's renovation line. 
  2. As for organizational rectification, we have paid 
attention to: Complying with various principles and 
stipulations in the party statutes, especially the principles on 
democratic centralism, the system of collective leadership among 
party committee echelons, and broadening democratic principles; 
overcoming disunity; and improving criticism and self-criticism 
activities. Over 50 percent of the grassroots party 
organizations have already been able to establish correct 
working procedures. In certain provinces, 100 percent of 
grassroots party organizations have been able to establish new 
working procedures. Various sectors and localities have kept in 
mind on the need to focus on the grass roots in organizational 
rectification. They have consolidated poorly performing 
grassroots party organizations and have satisfactorily resolved 
various flashpoints, such as such as those in Hai Hung, Hanoi, 
Yen Bai, and Tay Ninh. According to reports from 28 provinces 
and cities and from the party Central Committee Military 
Commission, the average number of clean and steadfast party 
organizations has increased 7.8 percent, while the average 
number of poorly performing party organizations has dropped 2.5 
percent. The number of poorly performing party organizations is 
still high in the mountain regions, however. 
  3. Regarding work related to party members, analysis shows 
that the number of qualified party members making good efforts 
is usually 30-40 percent. The number of poor party members 
accounts for only 5-10 percent, while the number of disqualified 
party members constitutes only 1-5 percent of the total. Worthy 
of note in the work relating to party members is that we have 
not just analyzed the qualities of party members; we have also 
dealt with poor performers. Party organizations have developed 
programs and objectives for training party members so they can 
strive to surge forward and perform their assigned missions. As 
a result, some localities have assigned 60-70 percent of their 
party members with specific duties. 
  In 1993 alone, the party as a whole took disciplinary action 
against 48,499 party members, or 2.3 percent of the total number 
of party members in the country. Many of these party members 
held high positions. While resolutely removing disqualified 
members from the party, party organizations have also stepped up 
party development. That is why the number of new party members 
has increased annually. In 1993, the number of new party members 
increased 30 percent over 1992, with youths and intellectuals 
making up a large part. This shows that along with the results 
obtained from the renovation process, the party has really been 
able to attract the younger generation and the intelligentsia. 
  4. Regarding the cadre-related and mass mobilization tasks, 
our initial achievements have been encouraging, thus satisfying 
the people's desire, promoting the unique characteristics of 
regions inhabited by ethnic minorities, and strengthening female 
cadres' activities. 
  In commending female cadres, we should consider their 
political background and ethics, their efforts in observing 
party discipline, their relations with the masses, and their 
capability in carrying out tasks to meet the requirements of the 
renovation process. 
  5. There must be further changes in the party leadership in 
order to implement the main task of developing the socioeconomic 
situation to strengthen the market economy. 
  It is necessary to mention here that we have attached 
importance to the countryside and taken grass-roots party 
organizations as a basis for implementing various party 
resolutions and official lines and policies. 
  The report of Comrade Truong My Hoa, secretary of the 
Central 
Committee, stressed efforts to renovate and revamp the party 
while presenting a general assessment on the causes of the 
shortcomings experienced by female cadres in carrying out party 
tasks and activities. This was due to less attention paid by 
leaders of party committees to planning, training, and helping 
female cadres to develop. 
  The conference discussed and made concrete proposals aimed 
at 
strengthening the renovation and rectification of the party, 
while enhancing the role of female cadres to meet requirements 
of the new situation, especially after the midterm national 
party conference. 
  Regarding the efforts to continue revamping and renovating 
the party, the conference established the following essential 
tasks to be carried out during the next two years: 
  1. Efforts to make grass-roots party organizations a basis 
for building pure and strong party units and efforts to 
implement the socioeconomic development program from the central 
to grass-roots levels. Only by satisfactorily developing the 
party role at the grass-roots level, will we be able to 
effectively implement party and state resolutions, lines, and 
policies. 
  2. Regarding cadre-related tasks, we must strive to create 
favorable conditions for each party member and organization to 
take the lead in all tasks so as to encourage people to 
participate in various activities. For female cadres, local 
leaders must formulate better plans to recruit and train them to 
increase their number and enhance their capabilities. The 
quality of cadres rests with their background knowledge, ethics, 
and capability in fulfilling assigned tasks. Various party 
organizations may apply the transfer system to train and foster 
responsible cadres and party members to enhance their skills and 
capabilities. 
  3. Party members must pay attention to the mass mobilization 
work, while participating in tasks to renovate the party 
leadership and promote the market economy. 
  The conference also discussed and called for efforts to 
concretize and resolve various issues. These include issues on 
allowing party members to engage in economic activities, 
restoring party affairs committees of various organizations, and 
improving party organizations at state and private enterprises. 
Efforts must also be made to perfect the echelons of party 
committees and strengthen party building in almost 3,800 hamlets 
where no party members have been admitted. 
  Dear friends, in his address to the conference, General 
Secretary Do Muoi stressed the significant role of our party 
line and policy on renovating and revamping the party. He said 
that the people have placed firm confidence in our party and its 
renovation policy. As a result, during the past several years 
we have continued to overcome numerous difficulties and scored 
encouraging achievements. We still face numerous acute ordeals, 
however, and we must strive to continue to renovate and revamp 
the party. 
  The comrade general secretary stressed: This is a major and 
difficult task. To build a pure, firm, and strong party worthy 
of the people's love and trust, we must firmly maintain and 
strengthen the proletarian characteristics while eliminating all 
forms and concepts of coercion and oppression. Our fundamental 
party ideology rests with Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh 
thought. Many party members during the past several years have 
taken the lead and set a good example in implementing the 
renovation process. Given the current requirements, however, we 
must strive to renovate and revamp the party more vigorously 
while effectively carrying out concrete tasks set by the midterm 
national party conference for the next two years. 
  Comrade Do Muoi also analyzed the necessity to broaden 
democracy within the party and the relations between democracy 
and centralized leadership. He said that efforts must be made 
to enhance the intelligence of each party committee echelon to 
score achievements in the socioeconomic development program. We 
must pay special attention to strengthening the party building 
task at the grass-roots level, while maintaining close relations 
with the people and motivating them to participate in various 
revolutionary movements. This is the most basic task of our 
party and state, through which we will score concrete 
achievements in the socioeconomic development program and foil 
the peaceful evolution schemes of the hostile forces. [end

  [Text] Dear friends: This morning, Thursday 26 May, the 
Ninth National Assembly's Fifth Session opened at the Ba Dinh 
Conference Hall in Hanoi. Before the session, the National 
Assembly deputies visited the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum and laid a 
floral wreath. 
  Attending the opening session were party and state leaders 
Do 
Muoi, Le Duc Anh, and Vo Van Kiet; Pham Van Dong and Vo Chi 
Cong, advisers to the party Central Committee; and many senior 
revolutionary cadres. The opening session was also attended by 
members of diplomatic corps in Hanoi. After the ceremony to 
salute the national flag, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc 
Manh opened the session. He said: 
  [Begin Nong Duc Manh recording] Today, the Fifth Session of 
the SRV's Ninth National Assembly begins its session. On behalf 
of the National Assembly Standing Committee, I wholeheartedly 
welcome and extend my wishes for the good health of the party 
and state leaders, National Assembly deputies, distinguished 
guests, members of the diplomatic corps, international friends, 
and all people and friends present at this solemn opening 
session of the National Assembly. [applause] 
  Dear National Assembly deputies, in the past few months our 
national situation has experienced many positive changes. The 
socioeconomy has continued to stabilize and develop, creating 
the opportunity to achieve and overfulfill key targets in the 
1994 duties outlined in the National Assembly resolutions. 
National defense and security have been maintained. Foreign 
relations and other areas have been making significant progress. 
Many legal documents and resolutions issued by the National 
Assembly have been implemented in real life, thereby positively 
serving the renovation undertaking. 
  This is the result of the efforts exerted by our entire 
party, people, and Army as well as the implementation of a 
foreign policy of openness to increase relations with countries 
in the region and expand relations with all the countries of the 
world, both near and far. This is also the result of the 
efforts exerted by the government, sectors, and echelons in 
their concentration on guidance and management for the 
successful implementation of targets set by the National 
Assembly resolutions. 
  We still face many difficulties, however, because of the 
slow 
process of overcoming long-term shortcomings and problems as 
well as the higher demands in the new development period. The 
new situation requires more and greater efforts on our part to 
fulfill the 1994 goals and duties outlined by the National 
Assembly resolutions. 
  The renovation undertaking requires the National Assembly to 
accelerate and heighten the quality of its legislative 
activities aimed at gradually building a uniform and complete 
legal system to serve the undertaking of national construction 
and protection effectively, maintain order and discipline, and 
truthfully carry out state and social management according to 
law. [end recording] 
  Chairman Nong Duc Manh clearly stated that in this session 
the main duty of the National Assembly is to examine and pass 
the labor code and five other laws. The five laws are: the 
revised law on the organization of people's councils and 
people's committees, the revised law on the election of people's 
councils, the law on the promotion of domestic investment, the 
law to levy a tax on the transfer of land use rights, and the 
law to revise and amend some articles of the Law on Military 
Obligation. The National Assembly will also offer its views on 
the planning of the civil law. 
  Also in this session, the National Assembly will hear a 
government report on the implementation of the National Assembly 
resolutions during the first half of this year. It will also 
consider supplementary government reports on the implementation 
of the National Assembly resolution on practicing thrift and 
fighting waste, corruption, and smuggling; the allocation and 
execution of the state budget for 1994; the situation regarding 
foreign investment in Vietnam and the effectiveness of using 
investment capital; and our government's foreign relations 
activities during the first half of this year. 
  The National Assembly will examine reports by the National 
Assembly Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, the 
Supreme People's Organ of Control, the Nationality Committee, 
and other National Assembly committees on their activities 
during the first half of 1994. 
  On the basis of those reports, the National Assembly will 
discuss, analyze, and correctly evaluate the true national 
situation from the beginning of this year to the present in 
order to determine effective lines and measures to continue the 
successful execution of its duties in the second half of 1994. 
  In response to the state president, the National Assembly 
will consider and approve the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of 
the Sea. It will also consider, discuss, and decide on some 
other important issues. 
  Lastly, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh said: 
  [Begin Nong Duc Manh recording] Dear National Assembly 
deputies, the Ninth National Assembly's Fifth Session is opening 
at a time when people throughout the country are 
enthusiastically welcoming major national anniversaries in the 
1994-95 period. Recently, our compatriots countrywide jubilantly 
marked the 40th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory. This 
provided an occasion for our compatriots at home and abroad to 
review our glorious national history, uphold the national 
tradition of unsubmissiveness, further consolidate the universal 
solidarity bloc, and continue to take the renovation process to 
a higher stage of development. We also marked the 104th 
birthday of the great Uncle Ho. Once again, our compatriots and 
combatants nationwide became even more profoundly aware of Uncle 
Ho's distinguished services. Let us be determined to follow the 
socialist path chosen by our party, people, and Uncle Ho. 
  The resolutions of the seventh party congress and the 
midterm 
national party congress entrusted our entire party and people 
with new and important tasks. Let us grasp all advantages, 
overcome all dangers, and do all we can to serve the cause of 
national construction and defense and the task of making the 
people rich and the country powerful, as well as of bringing 
about social justice and civilization. 
  In view of the new situation, and as members of the 
highest-level organ of power, National Assembly deputies have a 
very heavy duty to fulfill; namely, building a law-governed 
Vietnamese state that truly belongs to, comes from, and works 
for the people. Acting in line with that spirit, I solemnly 
suggest that National Assembly deputies develop democracy, 
contribute views, seek solutions, and suggest ways to carry out 
the agenda of the National Assembly successfully. 
  I would like to declare the Fifth Session of the SRV's Ninth 
National Assembly open. I wish the session success. Thank you, 
comrades and deputies. [applause] [end recording] 
  Dear friends, following Nong Duc Manh's opening speech to 
the 
National Assembly, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai delivered 
a report on behalf of the government and the prime minister on 
the fulfillment of the tasks for the first six months of 1994 as 
set forth by the National Assembly's resolutions, and on a 
number of important issues that need to be resolved in the days 
ahead to implement successfully the National Assembly's 
resolutions on the tasks for 1994. In evaluating the current 
situation, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai pointed out the 
following four outstanding traits: 
  1. The tempo of economic and financial growth of previous 
years continued to be maintained and developed in the first six 
months of 1994, thus producing relatively good progress in 
production, goods circulation, finance, money, and external 
economic relations. The growth rate than that of the same 
period in previous years. 
  2. Along with economic growth and an increase in the income 
of the vast majority of the population, cultural and social 
activities also made marked progress. 
  3. Our country's diplomatic relations continued to be 
broadened and strengthened in accordance with the need for 
multilateralization and diversification. 
  4. Changes for the better were made in the direction and 
supervision of the state management system. 
  Regarding the first outstanding trait, Deputy Prime Minister 
Phan Van Khai said: 
  [Begin Phan Van Khai recording] The fine economic and 
financial achievements of the past several years continued to be 
maintained and developed in the first six months of 1994, thus 
producing relatively good progress in production, goods 
circulation, finance, money, and external economic relations. 
The growth rate was higher than the same period in previous 
years. It is expected that the winter-spring grain output will 
reach a record volume of 1 million tons more than last year, an 
increase of 10 percent. The rural economy continued to show an 
increase in industrial and special crop yields as well as in the 
development of animal husbandry, aquaculture, and 
non-agricultural occupations. Industrial output in the first 
six months of the year increased by 12 percent over the same 
period last year. The target set for the whole year was 11 
percent. 
  With the relatively harmonious development of various 
economic elements, cities, and industrial centers, a number of 
major electrical power and transport projects have been 
completed and put in use. These include the last group of 
generators of the Hoa Binh Hydroelectric Plant, the electrical 
power plant in Ba Ria, the 220-kilovolt power grid of Ba 
Ria-Long Binh, the road section from North Thang Long to Noi 
Bai, and so forth, 
  The most significant project, the 500-kilovolt power grid, 
has been completed on schedule following two years of 
construction despite countless difficulties and obstacles. It 
reflects a high level of effort by all parties involved to 
ensure stable and safe operations. Experimental operation 
started on 20 May and the network will be officially switched on 
by early June to carry electricity from north to south, an 
indication of mutual development in the national economy and 
people's lives. 
  The increase in export value was estimated at 27 percent; 
the 
target was 20 percent. Import value increased by 23.4 percent. 
The amount of official development aid, or ODA, signed in the 
first quarter of this year nearly doubled compared to all of 
1993. Direct foreign investment projects licensed in the first 
six months may reach a total of $2 billion in registered 
capital, or two-thirds of all of last year. The amount of 
capital actually put in use increased by 60 percent over the 
same period last year. 
  Total retail merchandise sales were estimated to increase by 
37.6 percent to respond to the diversified demands of the 
people, who now have better incomes and purchasing power. The 
transportation of goods and passengers, services for domestic 
and international tourists, and other services have proceeded to 
new heights. The retail sales index of goods and service for 
the first four months of the year increased by 5.4 percent, 
mainly due to an increase in the price of food staples during 
the Tet festival. Prices have returned to normal since March. 
  According to reports from the Statistics General Department, 
the consumer goods index in May 1994 increased by 0.6 percent 
over April; food staples increased by 1.1 percent, non-food 
goods by 0.2 percent, and services by 0.4 percent. If we 
compare May 1994 with December 1993, the price index has 
increased by 6 percent; food staples have increased by 11.1 
percent, other goods by 1 percent, and services by 5.9 percent. 
In short, prices this year increased more rapidly than the same 
period last year, though the increase mainly affected food 
staples, a trend that suits the government's policy of not 
letting the price of food staples fall too low. 
  Domestic budget expenditures were planned to increase by 50 
percent over the same period last year. The annual increase was 
planned at 31.5 percent. Phase two of the new wage policy, 
which would introduce an increase of 25 percent to the wage 
fund, has been developed since early this year in a way that 
will not cause sudden changes in prices or strain the cash flow, 
and will ensure smooth monetary circulation. The exchange rates 
and gold price did not suffer any sudden fluctuations. The 
credit system was significantly expanded, and the balance 
surplus was estimated to increase by 23 percent over late 1993. 
  The rate of credit loans to the non-state sector -- mainly 
to 
farming households -- increased from 30 percent in 1993 to 40 
percent in first half of this year. [end recording] 
  In the second part of his report, Deputy Prime Minister Phan 
Van Khai outlined the major tasks that need intensive guidance 
in the last six months of the year. These tasks are: 
  1. To continue to maintain a healthy and stable financial 
and monetary market with the main aim of balancing the budget. 
  2. To ensure the constant progress of major projects and 
create conditions to increase investment in various economic 
sectors. 
  3. To expand external relations and external economic 
activities. 
  4. To continue to implement the National Assembly 
resolution on practicing thrift and fighting waste, corruption, 
and smuggling. 
  5. To widen and improve the efficiency of scientific, 
educational, cultural, and social activities. 
  6. To speed up economic reform in tandem with 
administration reform. 
  In the last part of his report, Deputy Prime Minister Phan 
Van Khai commented that after the first half of 1994, reality 
clearly shows that opportunities and risks are entangled. This 
requires new actions for a new stage of development. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai affirmed: 
  [Begin Phan Van Khai recording] As a result of good 
socioeconomic development, the cultural and physical lives of 
our people have been improved to a higher level. The vitality 
of the society has been enhanced, as demonstrated by the strong 
progress of many business establishments, entrepreneurs, and 
families in both urban and rural regions and plains and highland 
regions. This strength can be further developed along with the 
wider and more in-depth continuation of renovation, the most 
concrete task of which is to combine economic reform with 
administration reform. This is the foundation for the effective 
motivation of all outside sources. 
  In the new situation, the implementation of the policy of 
the 
great national unity bloc will reach a higher level of 
importance, with a concrete step being the upcoming conference 
of the Vietnam Fatherland Front. This conference will motivate 
the talents and manpower sources of all Vietnamese -- domestic 
and overseas alike -- to contribute to the undertaking of 
building the fatherland. It will surely bring great potential 
toward accomplishing the objectives of a rich people, powerful 
country, and equitable and civilized society. 
  The government, National Assembly, Fatherland Front, and 
other mass organizations should endeavor in their positions and 
responsibilities to organize, encourage, guide, and help the 
people strive to fulfill and exceed all targets and duties for 
1994 as stipulated by the resolutions of the National Assembly, 
thus preparing well for 1995 and later years. [end recording] 
  Dear friends, after listening to the government report, the 
National Assembly continued its work and heard the following 
reports: 
  -- Tran Dinh Hoan, minister of labor, war invalids, and 
social welfare, read a report on behalf of the government on the 
draft labor code. 
  -- Bui Ngoc Thanh, vice chairman of the National 
Assembly's Committee for Social Issues, read an investigative 
report on the draft labor code. 
  -- Finance Minister Ho Te read a report on behalf of the 
government on the draft law on land use transfer tax. 
  -- Tran Van Nhan, vice chairman of the National Assembly's 
Economic and Budget Committee, read an investigative report on 
the draft law on land use transfer tax. 
  This afternoon, the National Assembly deputies met for group 
discussions to prepare for the plenary discussion on the draft 
labor code. 
  The National Assembly will resume its work in the conference 
hall tomorrow morning.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 26 -- Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van 
Khai on behalf of the government presented a report on the 
implementation of the socio-economic tasks in the first six 
months of 1994, and orientations for socio-economic development 
in the coming time, at a regular session of the National 
Assembly opening here this morning. 
  The report notes that the positive financial and economic 
changes of the past few years have been sustained, which brought 
about rather comprehensive progress in the fields of economic 
production, goods circulation, finance-monetary and foreign 
trade with a higher growth rate compared with the corresponding 
period in the past few years. 
  `The winter-spring crop is expected to achieve the highest 
output so far, up one million tonnes compared with last year (or 
an increase of 10 per cent), the agricultural economic structure 
has initially reformed to the direction of increasing the rates 
of industrial crops especially trees, animal breeding, 
particularly aquaculture and non-farming occupations. 
  `The industrial production in the period under review is 
expected to increase 12 per cent compared with the same period 
last year (the target put forth for the whole year is 11 per 
cent), with the synchronous development of all economic sectors, 
of cities and industrial zones'... 
  ...`The export value is estimated at an increase of 27 
percent (seven per cent higher than the yearly target), import 
value is expected to increase 23.4 percent. The foreign 
Official Development Aid (ODA) sources signed in the first 
quarter of this year has doubled the 1993 amount. 
  The direct foreign investment projects licensed in the first 
half of 1994 had a total legal capital of USD 2 billion, or 
two-thirds of last year's figure... 
  `The total value of retail sales is expected up by 37.6 per 
cent, meeting the diversified demands of the population with 
higher incomes and consumption power. Goods and passengers 
transportation, domestic and international tourism, and other 
services have broadened rapidly. Price indexes of retail sale 
and service in the first fourth months of this year increased 
5.4 per cent, mainly for food and foodstuffs during Tet 
holidays. But since March the prices have returned stability'. 
  The report also notes that `with economic growth and the 
income increase of a major part of the population, 
socio-cultural activities have been improved remarkably'. 
  `The external relations of the country continue to be 
broadened and strengthened in the direction of 
multi-lateralization and diversification. The exchange of 
visits made by high-ranking leaders of Vietnam and other 
countries, especially those in the region has contributed to the 
promotion of mutual understanding, and enhancement of multisided 
cooperation. After the resumption of relations of international 
monetary and financial organizations with Vietnam, the lifting 
of the US trade embargo against Vietnam in early this year has 
created new, favourable conditions for the process of 
normalization of relations between Vietnam and the US, thereby 
pushing up the cooperative relations between Vietnam and other 
countries as well as international organizations. 
  `Vietnam's international relations have been developing 
rather quickly in a positive trend, thus making contributions to 
the environment of peace, stability and cooperation for national 
defence and construction. However, there have been complicated 
developments in our border areas, the most outstanding of which 
are recent violations of our country's exclusive economic zones 
and continental shelf, and the developments in Cambodia include 
many worrysome factors. 
  On major issues to be settled in the second half of this 
year, Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said that great 
efforts should be made to continue to make the country's finance 
and monetary system healthy and stable, to keep the state budget 
balance, to control the inflation rate at single digit increase, 
to ensure the construction progress of major projects and create 
more conditions to promote investment of all economic sectors. 
  On the broadening of external relations and economy, Vice 
P.M. Khai said that `complicated and sensitive external 
relations require us to be more vigilant, dynamic and creative 
in the implementation of a foreign policy of independence and 
sovereignty to bring into full play the strength of the entire 
nation in combination with international strength in order to 
cope with current challenges, and take advances to opportunities 
to step up industrialization and modernization of the country'. 
[sentence as received] 
  Mr. Khai went on: `We are actively settling outstanding 
issues and disputes with some countries through peaceful 
negotiation. We are ready to proceed to normalization with the 
united states, to join ASEAN and enter into multi-sided 
cooperation in the Pacific region, and at the same time to 
continue consolidating and expanding cooperative ties with all 
countries and international organizations. 
  `Together with the enhancement of state-level relations it 
is 
necessary to develop cooperative ties in the economic, 
scientific and technical, cultural fields, expand cooperation 
with non-governmental organizations, and people to people 
contacts and enhance foreign information service'. 
  Mr. Khai said that the government is preparing an overall 
project for developing external economy in the new situation, 
and he pointed out some tasks to be done from now to the end of 
the year. These tasks include guiding the implementation of new 
regulations on managing and distributing the Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) from foreign countries, improving 
the environment and attracting direct foreign investment, 
actively implementing the National Assembly's resolution on 
practice thrift, fighting against corruption and smuggling, 
effectively expanding and raising the quality of scientific, 
educational, cultural and social welfare activities, and pushing 
up economic reforms in combination with administrative reforms.

  [Text] Hanoi, May 26 (AFP) -- Vietnam denied Thursday that 
a leading political dissident was on a hunger strike to protest 
harsh prison treatment. The US Human Rights/Asia Watch 
organisation said Tuesday that professor Doan Viet Hoat went 
began a hunger strike in April after being put in chains at a 
reeducation camp in northern Vietnam for refusing forced labour. 
  A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Thursday that Hoat was not 
on hunger strike, had not been forced to work and had not been 
treated any differently than other prisoners. But the spokesman 
confirmed that Hoat, former vice-rector of the Van Anh Buddhist 
University, had been transferred to another prison camp closer 
to the Laos border. 
  "This is a normal transfer under Vietnamese law," he told 
AFP. But Asia Watch maintains that the camp, Thanh Cam, is for 
hardened criminals. 
  Hoat, who suffers from serious kidney problems, was being 
held in Ba Sao prison camp, south of Hanoi, before his transfer. 
Asia Watch expressed concern for his health since he had been 
put in chains. It also said Hoat's wife had been refused 
permission to see him. 
  The spokesman said the reports were untrue and maintained 
that Hoat was in normal health. Hoat was jailed for 15 years in 
July 1993 for activities "violating Vietnam's penal code." 
  On Tuesday, Hanoi denied reports that four Buddhist monks, 
jailed following violent incidents in Hue a year ago, were on 
hunger strike at a reeducation camp in the southwest.

  [Text] President Clinton's decision to renew China's 
favored trading status has been welcomed by American business 
groups, but condemned by human rights organizations. 
  Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, has also 
welcomed 
the announcement and the decision to remove the link between 
China's trade status and human rights issue. Senator Evans said 
it was unlikely that the withdrawal of Most Favored Nation 
status would have significantly advanced the human rights cause 
in China. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0535 GMT on 27 May, in a 
similar 
report, adds: "Canberra said pressure on China to make human 
rights improvements in order to get MFN status again had 
appeared counterproductive, with change in China being more 
grudging than it might otherwise have been. `Trade and 
investment is playing a catalytic role in China's economic 
reform through the introduction of ideas, capital, technology 
and foreign exchange,' Evans said. Economic growth and 
liberalisation would `generate their own momentum for political 
liberalisation,' he said. `The Australian Government agrees 
with President Clinton's sentiment that, if we are serious about 
improving human rights, the best path is now to intensify and 
broaden engagement between the US and China,' Evans said. 
  ["In a statement echoing the view of trade analysts here, 
opposition trade spokesman Tim Fischer said the US decision was 
correct and that withdrawal of MFN status would have threatened 
Australia's trade, especially in wool. `China has been 
extremely successful in value-adding to its purchases of 
Australian wool and in marketing woollen clothing in the US. 
This outcome is clearly a breakthrough for US trade policy that 
was showing signs of faltering, and will be welcomed by 
Australia's wool growers.'"]

  [Text] CANBERRA, May 24 (AFP) -- Australia has decided 
against sending troops to Rwanda until their safety can be 
reasonably assured, Defence Minister Robert Ray said Tuesday. 
Ray told an upper-house Senate estimates committee that UN 
progress towards setting in place preconditions under which 
Australia would send troops was "not encouraging". 
  Australia wanted to see from the UN a proposal for a clear 
and viable mission with a set timetable and the creation of a 
political process to resolve the situation in Rwanda, he said. 
  The UN asked Australia to contribute about 300 troops to a 
peace- keeping mission, nominating a number of specialist areas, 
including movement control officers, engineers, signallers and 
medical teams. 
  Ray said Australia was sympathetic to the problems of 
Rwanda, 
which has been ravaged by tribal fighting. But the deployment 
of any Australian troops and their security remained a crucial 
issue and if Australia sent a 180-member engineering unit, it 
would most likely have to be accompanied by a rifle company of 
about 120 soldiers for protection. 
  "If I cannot be assured of their protective security, we 
don't send them in," he said. "We are intensely disturbed and 
moved by what is happening in Rwanda. But the response has to 
be one that will work. If you take the wrong course, you will 
just make matters worse." 
  Aid groups estimate half a million people, mostly Tutsis, 
have died in the bloodbath that erupted on April 6. 
  Ray also said the government was considering a request from 
the Cambodian government for military assistance, a request made 
of several other unnamed countries as well.

  [Text] Australia's defense minister, Robert Ray, has hit 
out at the United Nations for failing to come up with a workable 
plan for Rwanda. Senator Ray said a UN force in Rwanda could be 
a total disaster unless it has a well defined mandate. 
  The defense minister was responding to the UN secretary 
general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who said the failure of the 
international community to confront genocide in Rwanda was a 
scandal. 
  [Begin Ray recording] It could well be a criticism of us and 
let me be equally critical of he and his colleagues, who had not 
come up with a workable plan. No one is about to risk lives 
where the lives are risked through poor planning, poor 
logistics, and poor sense of mission. [end recording] 
  Sen. Ray said as a good world citizen, Australia would look 
at contributing troops to a peacekeeping force in Rwanda. 
However, Sen. Ray it is up to the UN to propose a mission based 
on a feasible political solution, a clear mandate, and a clear 
timetable.

  [Text] Sydney, May 25 (AFP) -- Australian government 
forecasts for rapid economic growth were thown into doubt 
Wednesday as official data unexpectedly showed a slump in 
business investment, analysts said. 
  Handing down his budget for the year to June 30, 1995, 
Australian Treasurer Ralph Willis said on May 10 that a surge in 
business investment -- forecast at 14.6 percent for 1994-95 -- 
was "crucial" to his forecasts of economic growth. But the 
Australian Bureau of Statistics reported Wednesday that private 
capital expenditure fell 5.4 percent in the three months to 
March 31 to a seasonally adjusted 5.884 billion Australian 
dollars (4.2 billion US). The median market forecast had been 
for a rise of 5.0 percent. 
  "The government's whole economic strategy is based on very, 
very poor foundations altogether," said Societe Generale 
Australia's chief economist, Ivana Bottini. 
  "They recognised that the big weakness was business 
investment and they did absolutely nothing to promote business 
investment in the budget -- they assumed it would just magically 
improve," she said. 
  In raw terms, the bureau predicted a six percent rise in 
private sector capital spending in 1994-95 from the 1993-94 
estimate of 27.452 billion dollars. That rise depended on 
actual capital spending exceeding latest private sector 
expectations by about 10 percent. This had occured during 
1992-93 and was likely to happen in 1993-94, the bureau said. 
  "On the face of it, even the expectations data for 1994-95 
appear likely to fall short of the rosy outlook in the budget 
forecasts for a 14.5 percent increase in investment," said 
Stephen Koukoulas, senior economist at Citibank Australia. 
  "These figures suggest that the budget forecasts for 
business 
investment are very optimistic." 
  Willis insisted his forecasts remained intact because actual 
business investment in the next financial year would outstrip 
private sector expectations by more than the bureau's forecasts. 
  "With economic conditions continuing to improve and with 
general business confidence remaining extremely high," he said, 
the difference between actual investment and business 
expectations "can be expected to increase." 
  Bottini, however, said Australia would be doing well to 
achieve a six percent rise in business investment 1994-95.

  [Text] The treasurer, Ralph Willis, says budget forecasts 
will be met despite a slump in quarterly figures. His comments 
follow the release of statistics showing a drop of 5 percent in 
the March quarter. 
  Mr. Willis said budget predictions for business investment 
growth are on target and expectations of investment in 1993-94 
are virtually unchanged. Mr. Willis said all that has happened 
is that investment is happening in the June quarter rather than 
the March quarter. 
  [Begin Willis recording] Capital expenditure figures showing 
a 5 percent fall in the March quarter have produced predictably 
alarmist headlines, and fear-mongering comments from the 
perennial pessimists and political opportunists. We do not 
accept these figures warrant such interpretation. [end recording]

  [Text] Noumea, May 27 (AFP) -- The second round of 
Franco-Fijian military exercises ended Friday in Fiji and New 
Caledonia, military sources said here. For the second year in a 
row, 35 Fijian soldiers were integrated for 12 days in France's 
Pacific marine infantry regiment, based in Noumea, and carried 
out various maneuvers. At the same time, a group of French 
soldiers from the regiment went to Fiji to take part in similar 
exercises. Transportation was carried out by the French, as the 
Fijians have no air force. 
  The French military commander here, General Rene Delhome, 
said military cooperation with Fiji would be stepped up in the 
future.

  [Text] Fiji's review of its racially biased constitution 
will not be headed by an independent commissioner. Fiji's 
cabinet this week decided that only Fiji nationals will sit on 
the 11-member commission drawn from all the political parties. 
The opposition parties had demanded an independent head to 
review the constitution which discriminated against Fiji Indians 
giving them only 27 seats in the 70-seat parliament. The 
commission's final report is due by the end of 1996.

  [Text] AUCKLAND, May 26 (AFP) -- The government of one of 
the world's smallest states, the central Pacific republic of 
Kiribati, has fallen amid claims of misuse of public funds by a 
cabinet minister, according to a broadcast report Thursday. 
  A Council of State has taken over the day-to-day running 
from 
President Teatao Teannati moved out of the presidential 
residency hours after he fell from power, the state-owned 
Broadcasting and Publications Authority said. 
  In the 36-seat Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu, the assembly, the 
ruling National Progressive Party suffered a defeat, 21-19, when 
the opposition moved to set up a select committee to investigate 
the misuse of public funds. 
  Opposition Maneaba Party MP Teburoro Tito claimed funds had 
been misused in hotel accommodation, transport, entertainment 
and gifts. 
  In an attempt to settle the situation, Vice-President 
Taomati 
Iuta proposed setting up a commission of inquiry, instead of a 
parliamentary committee, but this also was defeated. Speaker 
Beretitara Neeti then dissolved parliament. He now sits in the 
interim Council of State along with the chief justice and the 
chairman of the Public Service Commission. 
  Under the constitution, general elections are expected to 
take place by August. Elections are normally held every four 
years and another was not due until next year. 
  Kiribati, the former British colony of the Gilbert Islands, 
consists of 33 islands scattered over five million square 
kilometers (two million square miles) in the Pacific Ocean. 
  Its 68,000 people, known as "I-Kiribati," are predominantly 
Micronesian. The word Kiribati is the closest local 
pronunciation that the 13-letter island alphabet could manage 
for Gilbert. 
  Its capital atoll, Tarawa, was virtually flattened by the 
Americans when they landed marines there in 1943 to dislodge 
Japanese forces, who had taken over most of the Gilberts. 
  The largest coral atoll in the world, Kiritimati or 
Christmas, was used for atmospheric nuclear testing by Britain 
and the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. 
  The Maneaba-ni-Maungatabu includes a seat for Banaba or 
Ocean 
Island although British phosphate mining all but destroyed the 
island and most of its people have been resettled in Fiji.

  The Council of State consists of the speaker of the 
parliament, the chairman of the Public Service Commission, and

stage when the general elections will be held, but the 
constitution demands that they must take place within three

  [Text] PORT VILA, May 26 (AFP) -- Vanuatu opposition 
parties tried to pass a no-confidence motion Thursday but were 
ruled out of order by the parliament's speaker. 
  Speaker Alfred Masing said the motion was not in order 
because the constitution stipulated that at least one week's 
notice must be given and the required seven days had not 
expired. Masing closed parliament and said the motion would be 
in order at the next available time slot on Tuesday. 
  All four opposition parties, however, insisted notice of the 
motion had been hand-delivered to Masing on May 18, with one 
party saying it had a copy of the motion bearing the speaker's 
stamp with that date. 
  Opposition sources said the 14-point no-confidence motion 
accused Prime Minister Maxime Carlot and his government of being 
"incapable of managing and managing the affairs of the state.

  [Text] A meeting was held at the International Business 
Center today at 0900 to explain the economic development 
situation and investment opportunities in Myanmar [Burma]. The 
meeting was attended by Forestry Minister Lieutenant General 
Chit Swe; Trade Minister Lt. Gen. Tun Kyi; Lt. Gen. Kyaw Ba, 
minister of hotels and tourism; Transport Minister Lt. Gen. 
Thein Win; Brigadier General Abel, minister of national planning 
and economic development; Information Minister Brig. Gen. Myo 
Thant; Deputy Foreign Minister U Nyunt Swe; Mr. Hartarto, the 
Indonesian coordinating minister for industrial and trade 
affairs; Communications Minister Dr. Haryanto Danudirto; Mr. 
Joop Ave, minister of tourism, posts, and telecommunications; 
senior departmental officials; entrepreneurs; Indonesian 
Ambassador to Myanmar Mohamed Sanusi; Myanmar 
Ambassador-Designate to Indonesia U Nyi Nyi Than; directors 
general and managing directors from government departments; 
local and foreign journalists led by U Hla Tun, director of news 
and periodicals; members of the boards of directors of joint 
ventures and corporations; members of economic organizations; 
and invited guests. 
  First, Brig. Gen. Abel, minister of national planning and 
economic development, using a projector, explained the economic 
development situation and investment opportunities in Myanmar. 
He gave statistics on Myanmar's national races, population, and 
natural resources; economic development situation; key social 
and economic factors; investment opportunities; investment 
policies, objectives, incentives, and guarantees; the 
agriculture, livestock breeding, fisheries, forestry, energy, 
industry, and transport sectors; and short-term plan 
implementation. 
  Brig. Gen. Abel said that 91 foreign companies from 16 
countries that understand Myanmar's investment policy had 
invested $1.05 billion as of 16 March 1994. They are currently 
engaged in their respective business enterprises. 
  In response to questions from the Indonesian entrepreneurs, 
Brig. Gen. Abel said foreign investment was welcomed by the 
government on a case by case basis if foreign investors want to 
invest in enterprises that require a large amount of investment. 
He said that entrepreneurs can meet with the transport minister 
to discuss the details they require on investment in domestic 
and external air services. He then pointed to the guarantees 
for foreign investment contained in the Myanmar Investment Law. 
  He said Myanmar's economic growth rate is very fast and its 
economic strength is growing, and that negotiations can be held 
on a firm basis. He said foreign entrepreneurs can invest from 
35 to 100 percent in joint ventures, and that the export 
processing industry has been marked as an area for investment. 
He said he expected gross domestic product to increase at an 
average of 5.2 to 6 percent yearly. 
  Brig. Gen. Abel said that 1996 has been declared Visit 
Myanmar Year; 500,000 tourists are expected to visit the 
country. He said we are aware of the enormity of this task. He 
said there is only one school in the country for training in the 
tourism industry. He said it is estimated that 1 million people 
need to be trained in the services sector for the expected 
500,000 tourists. He said trainees would be sent to friendly 
countries such as Indonesia for training, and it is hoped that 
they will hold training courses in Myanmar in return. He said 
we expect to face many problems in this endeavor, but we hope to

  [Text] Mai Sai, Chiang Rai Province -- Warlord Khun Sa's 
Muang Tai Army (MTA) yesterday claimed responsibility for 
blowing up the dyke of a reservoir to cut the water supplies to 
the border town of Tachilek opposite Mae Sai. 
  An aide to Khun Sa said one of the MTA's five sabotage units 
which infiltrated Tachilek was responsible for the explosion 
along the ridge of the dyke, about one kilometre southeast of 
Tachilek. The explosion took place at about noon Wednesday. 
  The blast destroyed the dyke so that the reservoir drained 
into the Mae Sai River. 
  The deputy governor of Chiang Rai who inspected the border 
opposite Tachilek, said the blast had caused water shortages in 
the town. 
  The act of sabotage was apparently part of the resistance to 
the ongoing suppression drive by Rangoon forces against Khun Sa 
which has captured part of the Shan State. 
  An MTA source said about 1,000 government troops from the 
77th Division in Shan Tung and 55th Division in Mong Yawng had 
arrived in Tachilek on Wednesday night. 
  They were expected to be despatched to Doi Kong Mon, about 
20 
kilometres southeast of Tachilek, which was captured by the MTA 
on April 18, in a bid to recapture it. 
  Heavy fighting in the area is expected very soon said the 
source. 
  Chao Klwan Muang, head of the political section of Khun Sa's 
MTA forces said at his command post at Doi Taw Kham near Doi 
Kong Mon that the Burmese people were disillusioned with the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council which took control of 
the country in 1989. 
  He said the SLORC was nearing its end as the people had 
suffered enough under its administration. 
  Chao Khwan Muang said government jet fighters had flown over 
Doi Kong Mon but no airstrikes had taken place because of bad 
weather On the Thai side of the border, government forces 
comprising rangers, border patrol police, provincial police and 
defence volunteers have been ordered on full alert along a 
30-kilometre stretch opposite Burma to prevent soldiers from the 
two warring sides and villagers fleeing the fighting crossing 
into Thailand. 
  Villagers in Mae Sai district said about 300-400 Burmese had 
already sneaked across the border to live with relatives in the 
district. 
  A Border Patrol Police source said last night the border 
with 
Mae Sai was expected to be closed from today.

  [Excerpts] The first triannual coordination meeting of the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] and the state 
and division law and order restoration councils for 1994 was 
held at the Army Commander in Chief Office's meeting hall this 
morning. 
  Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the SLORC and 
commander 
in chief of the Defense Services, attended the coordination 
meeting and delivered an address. 
  The meeting was attended by General Maung Aye, vice chairman 
of the SLORC and deputy commander in chief of the Defense 
Services; Vice Admiral Maung Maung Khin and Lieutenant General 
Tin Tun deputy prime ministers; members of the SLORC, 
secretary-1 and secretary-2 of the SLORC, ministers, chief 
justice, attorney general, auditor general, chairman of the 
Public Service Selection and Training Board, chairmen of the 
Yangon [Rangoon] and Mandalay City Development Committees, 
high-ranking officers from the Ministry of Defense, commanders 
of the regiments and divisions, deputy ministers, chairmen of 
the state and division law and order restoration councils, and 
responsible personnel. At the meeting, Lieutenant Colonel Pe 
Nyein, director general of the SLORC Office, acted as secretary 
of the meeting. 
  In his speech Than Shwe said: The main objective of this 
coordination meeting is to present, discuss, and coordinate on 
matters concerning programs to be carried out in 1994 and their 
successful implementation. He said economic growth rates in 
1992-93 and 1993-94 are satisfactory because the state has 
sought increased paddy rice production by giving priority to the 
agricultural sector, guided the development of other economic 
sectors, and designated the period since 1992-93 for stressing 
economic development of the country. He said 1994-95 has been 
designated as a year of growth in all-round production. That is 
why personnel from the respective states and divisions have to 
strive for the successful implementation of projects designated 
in all sectors. [passage omitted on tasks of personnel] 
  He continued and said: While we are striving for political 
stability and economic and social -- health and educational -- 
development, we are concentrating and working on economic 
development. One must be aware of the interdependency among the 
sectors. Food, clothing, and shelter are the most important 
elements in social life. That is why economic development is 
crucial to resolve food, clothing, and shelter problems. He 
said in 1993-94 that more 8 million baskets of paddy rice have 
been produced as targeted and he told personnel to continue 
efforts annual increases in paddy rice production. [passage 
omitted]. The meeting ended at 1600.

  [Text] MANNERPLAW, Burma, May 26 (AFP) -- Burma's National 
Convention, charged with drafting a new constitution for the 
country, is a "farce" aimed at keeping the ruling military junta 
in power, a convention delegate said Thursday. 
  "I have lost all faith in the National Convention," said 
Daniel Aung, who has defected to the opposition, at a press 
conference in this opposition stronghold near the Thai border, 
about 700 kilometres (420 miles) northwest of Bangkok. 
  The press conference was held to mark the anniversary of 
Burma's 1990 elections, in which the opposition won a landslide 
victory against the military junta, which then refused to 
recognize the election results. 
  Until last month, Aung was one of five leaders of a group of 
political parties -- consisting of 99 deputies elected in the 
1990 polls -- at the convention. 
  He is the second delegate to the convention -- which has 750 
members, 500 of whom are appointed by the ruling junta -- to 
have defected to the opposition since work on the constitution 
began in January 1993. 
  Aung conceded delegates were able to speak freely during 
debates at the convention, but said that the country's military 
leaders, who chair the proceedings, paid no attention to the 
deliberations. 
  "The SLORC (State Law and Order Restoration Council) simply 
went ahead and adopted the principles of its own choice," Aung 
said. "They just don't care." 
  Aung criticised the method for electing the country's next 
president which were devised to "only allow the military to 
permanently monopolize the executive power." 
  The junta has also demanded that the constitution grant the 
army "a leading role" in national affairs. 
  The former party leader also warned visitors of forming 
false 
impressions of Burma. 
  "Some foreign visitors in Rangoon might have the illusions 
that things in Burma are improving," he said. 
  "On the surface, in Rangoon, it might be true ... however, 
nobody dares to speak and it is because the whole population is 
still under the terror of guns," Aung said. 
  He also criticised the policy of "constructive engagement" 
adopted by the six member countries of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which calls for a rejection of 
western sanctions against the junta, or SLORC. 
  "I will state it briefly -- the Burmese people do not like 
'constructive engagement' with the SLORC." 
  Backing Aung was General Bo Mya of the rebel Karen National 
Union, the oldest and most powerful armed opposition group 
fighting against the SLORC. 
  The 67-year-old general, who is also president of the 
Democratic Alliance of Burma -- comprised of rebel ethnic 
minority opposition groups -- denounced the junta's call for a 
ceasefire with all rebel movements and rejected "any political 
solution." 
  The SLORC has signed official ceasefire agreements with 10 
of 
the country's 12 rebel ethnic movements. 
  Bo Mya has demanded that the government recognise the rights 
of minorities, adding that the SLORC "frankly announced to us 
that if we wanted to talk politics, we'll stay outdoors of the 
meeting." 
  The mainly Christian Karens, who are Burma's largest ethnic 
minority and among the few groups that do not deal in opium, 
have adopted a defensive strategy in dealing with the military 
junta, aimed at retaining their zones of control. 
  The general has asked to hold "passive negotiations" with 
the 
government.

  [Text] The Malaysian Government is currently monitoring in 
detail the British media's change of attitude toward Malaysia. 
Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz, minister of international trade and 
industry, said this to British Trade Minister Mr. Richard 
Needham, who called on her in her office this afternoon. 
  Speaking to reporters, Datuk Sri Dr. Rafidah said Mr. 
Needham, who also called on the prime minister, made a long-term 
proposal aimed at further enhancing Malaysia-Britain relations 
because Britian considers Malaysia an important trading partner. 
  Meanwhile, during her meeting with Mr. Peter Sutherland, 
chief director of GATT agreements, she said they agreed that the 
international community is uneasy over the U.S. Congress' 
reluctance to approve the agreement which was signed in 
Marrakech, Morocco. The U.S. action in delaying the approval 
could create new problems which could result in the dissolution 
of the decision reached at the Uruguay Round. This would 
negatively affect all trading nations.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP May 26 -- His Majesty King Norodom 
Sihanouk has said that a solution is still impossible to put an 
end to the mortal de facto partition of Cambodia. 
  In a letter addressed the 25 May to U.N. Secretary General 
Butros Butros-Ghali, the king said Cambodia was unfortunately 
divided in two parties, one is the zone under the government 
control and another is the Khmer Rouge autonomous zone. 
  However, the king said he had to obtain from the Khmer 
leaders of the two warring parties a durable and unconditional 
cease-fire on the whole territory of Cambodia. 
  The Cambodian government side agrees with the cease-fire, 
but 
the Khmer Rouges still keep silence in this matter, King 
Sihanouk said. 
  The Khmer Rouges did not implement the Paris peace agreement 
of Oct 23, 1991, therefore a new meeting in Paris or Jakarta 
would be useless, the king said. 
  No one will be able to threaten the Khmer Rouges to do what 
they refuse to do, King Sihanouk said. 
  "This is a long-term problem which threatens the existence 
of 
Cambodia and worries me a great deal and causes me to fall in 
despair," he said. 
  King Sihanouk said he would preside over the round-table 
talks at Chhanghsu-on on May 27, with the participation of 
National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim, Co-Prime Ministers Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, and Khieu Samphan, president of 
Kampuchea Democratic party.

  [Text] His Excellency [HE] Khieu Samphan, head of the Party 
of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], sent a message on 25 May to King 
Norodom Sihanouk. The gist of this message is as follows: 
  1. HE Khieu Samphan joyfully expressed his support for a 
unified and undivided Cambodia, with its territorial integrity 
in line with the frontiers recognized internationally from 1963 
to 1969. He also voiced support for Cambodia's national ideals 
of peace, (?solidarity), unity, and progress toward rebuilding 
(?Cambodia). 
  2. H.E. Khieu Samphan also stressed the cease-fire issue to 
the king. He said the situation in Cambodia is very complicated 
because of the 24-year war. The Vietnamese war of aggression 
alone has already lasted for 15 years. In addition, foreigners 
-- both old and new -- have come to interfere in Cambodia's 
internal affairs, both militarily and as civilians. 
  For this reason, to enable the cease-fire to proceed 
genuinely, clearly, and permanently, H.E. Khieu Samphan and the 
PDK proposed to the king that foreign observers from five 
countries be chosen from among the following 10 countries: 
Brunei, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Switzerland, 
Austria, Finland, the Philippines, and Egypt. H.E. Khieu 
Samphan proposed that these neutral foreign observers join the 
Cambodian joint commission in monitoring the cease-fire. 
  H.E. Khieu Samphan proposed cease-fire monitoring in the 
central, western, and eastern parts of Cambodia and on 
Cambodia's seas. This will ensure the cease-fire and prevent 
foreign troops and arms from entering Cambodia. The cease-fire 
may begin any day as long as cease-fire monitoring is thoroughly 
arranged. 
  H.E. Khieu Samphan stressed that a cease-fire would be a 
chance at a solution to end the war and achieve national 
reconciliation and peace. Therefore, it should be thoroughly 
arranged. All of Cambodia's problems should be discussed at the 
roundtable meeting without any preconditions. This will enable 
all Cambodian parties to discuss and settle all problems -- big 
and small -- in line with the goals (?of) genuine national 
reconciliation and peace which constitute the profound desire of 
our entire Cambodian nation and people.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP May 26 -- Malaysia is supplying 
munitions to Cambodia to enable government troops to launch a 
major offensive to finally crush the Khmer Rouge, THE NATION 
quoted an Asian diplomat as saying. 
  He said he believes Malaysia has already "arranged large 
quantities" of munitions for Phnom Penh, in preparation for an 
all out attack on the Khmer Rouge next month. 
  The diplomat said the arms build-up is proceeding despite 
the 
fact that Cambodian leaders and the Khmer Rouge are scheduled to 
meet for peace talks in Beijing [as received] later this week. 
  He said that Malaysian weaponry is sophisticated and 
probably 
the best of all Asian countries. 
  Last week a grenade was thrown into the compound of the 
Malaysian embassy in Phnom Penh. Nobody was injured and damage 
was limited. 
  But the attack is being linked to a report that the United 
States, Australia and France, which are considering supplying 
weapons to Cambodia, are pressuring Malaysia to join them. 
  The envoy noted that Cambodia's first and second prime 
ministers, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, had proposed to 
King Norodom Sihanouk that a cease-fire be called for June 13. 
  "It is possible that government troops, with military aid 
from Western countries and Malaysia, will launch a massive 
attack on the Khmer Rouge in an effort to eliminate them before 
the cease-fire," he said. 
  The three Cambodian leaders, Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen and 
Chea Sim, have agreed to meet the Khmer Rouge nominal leader 
Khieu Samphan in Beijing on Friday. 
  The meeting has been called by King Norodom Sihanouk with 
the 
declared objective of securing a cease in hostilities between 
Phnom Penh and the guerrillas who still command large tracts of 
the war- torn country. 
  Khieu Samphan, according to the diplomat, is scheduled to 
meet King Sihanouk Wednesday in Beijing to discuss the conflict 
before he meets the Cambodian premiers and National Assembly 
Chairman Chea Sim on Friday.

  [Text] On 21 May, the Vietnamese sent 20 truckloads of 
fresh troops to be stationed on the Route 10-Battambang 
battlefield. These Vietnamese troops stayed in Battambang 
Province for one day and one night to change their identity to 
the Khmer Royal Armed Forces before leaving for Route 10 to help 
the routed puppet soldiers who are fleeing the battlefield in 
disarray. 
  It should be recalled that at the beginning of May the 
Vietnamese sent 20 truckloads of troops to Battambang town to 
rescue the puppet troops, who had been routed from Pailin and 
various other important positions on Route 10 as well as the 
areas around Battambang town. Those puppet soldiers were smashed 
time and again even after being rescued by the Vietnamese troops. 
  This clearly proves that the aggressor Vietnamese troops 
have 
continued to fight in person on the Cambodian battlefield during 
the operation to seize Pailin. In March, 500 Vietnamese 
(?troops) also took part in the operation. 
  The Paris agreement demands the total withdrawal of the 
aggressor Vietnamese troops and forces from Cambodia, but the 
Vietnamese have refused to withdraw. Instead of overseeing the 
Vietnamese withdrawal, the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia] helped the Vietnamese. This is why every manner of 
aggressor Vietnamese forces -- in military uniforms and civilian 
clothes -- and 4 million Vietnamese nationals are still in 
Cambodia. [Words indistinct] under Vietnamese control in the 
military and civilian aspects. 
  To solve the problem of war in Cambodia, it is imperative to 
remove all categories of Vietnamese forces -- including the 4 
million Vietnamese nationals -- and all foreign interference in 
Cambodia's internal affairs so as to allow the Cambodian people 
and king to settle their own problems without any outside 
interference.

  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Cambodia is enjoying zero per cent 
inflation for the first time since the 1993 election, the 
government has stopped printing banknotes and has balanced tax 
revenue with government spending, Finance Minister Sam Rangsi 
said. 
  Before the election the country's inflation rate had reached 
200 per cent, Rangsi said, adding that Cambodia should be 
registered as the only country to reduce its inflation rate to 
zero while its economy is developing after a decade-long war. 
  "The growth rate of the GDP in 1993 is 5 per cent and we 
expect to increase it to 7 per cent this year," Rangsi said in 
an interview with THE NATION. 
  Rangsi said that one year after the UN-organized elections 
the government is still functioning, and civil servants and 
police have been fully and regularly paid their monthly salary. 
  "One year after the election, the government can maintain 
itself, not collapse. It can provide public utilities for the 
people -- water, electricity and other facilities. We did not 
collapse, although we got only US$13 million from the UN against 
a promise of about US$60 million for the first six months after 
the election," he said. 
  He blamed a budget deficit and inflation on the previous 
administration of then Prime Minister Hun Sen, of the Cambodian 
People's Party. The problem facing the country now was law 
enforcement, he said.

    [Editorial Report] Phnom Penh REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA in 
Cambodian on 25 May reports the following in its 
economic-business section on page 4: 
  On the issue of a cash-trapped state-run factory in Phnom 
Penh, the paper says Factory No. 8, which produces girders and 
iron sheets and which has been closed for nearly a year due to 
the lack of raw materials and funds, has finally been rented to 
a company named Hassan, owned by a group of local Muslims. 
According to an agreement signed on 29 April 1994, the Ministry 
of Industry, Mines, and Energy has granted the company the right 
to run the factory for a period of 20 years. 
  Concerning the income earned by the Posts and 
Telecommunications Ministry, the paper quotes Kev Vutthin, 
deputy director of the ministry's Planning, Accounting, and 
Finance Department, as saying that during the first four months 
of the year -- from early January to late April -- the ministry 
collected earnings of $8.5 million and over 431 million riels 
for the state coffers. The deputy director has further said 
that the revenue is from the sale of postal stamps and fees 
charged for local and overseas telephone calls. 
  Finally, commenting on the issue of renting state-owned 
factories to private companies, the paper says the problem is 
now becoming increasingly complicated. It quotes a report as 
pointing out that at present, 15 companies still owe a total 
amount of $185,000, the rental in the first quarter of the year, 
to the State. So far, 40 local and overseas firms have hired 
factories from the State, but only 10 of them are operative.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Are We Progressing or Retrogressing? When Will </F>
We Really Make It?"] 
  [Text] After the elections were held, the National Assembly 
formed, the Constitution drafted and passed, the king enthroned, 
and the Royal Government set up, the Cambodian people have hoped 
that with all of these accomplishments the country would at last 
enjoy peace, there would be happiness and security, and myriad 
foreign firms would flock in to invest in various fields, thus 
creating employment opportunities, educational and training 
facilities, and enabling Cambodians to rebuild their country and 
catch up with other more civilized nations. 
  What has happened, however, has been different from the 
expectations. It is observed that at present the politicians are 
busy quarreling with one another and political parties have 
nothing but mistrust for one another. Sometimes, people in the 
same party do not even speak the same language. 
  The fighting on the Anlung Veng and Pailin battlefields has 
produced no clear result; the proposal of a roundtable for 
national reunification and reconciliation has met with many 
obstacles; the economic law principles have yet to be 
promulgated; more and more foreign investors have pulled out 
because they are afraid to stay; the number of freighters 
bringing goods to the ports has gradually declined; tourist 
attractions have become very quiet, unlike what they used to be 
not so long ago; while battles at the front have intensified and 
each side has resorted to greater and greater savagery in 
retaliating against one another. 
  When will the leaders of the political groups stop their 
bickering and join hands in national economic reconstruction 
efforts, as they pledged to do when they were begging for aid at 
the Tokyo ICORC [International Conference on the Reconstruction 
of Cambodia] conference? 
  At a time when the government cannot eliminate the Khmer 
Rouge and the Khmer Rouge refuse to take part in reconstruction, 
it is the people who suffer so badly. It is these ongoing 
disputes and wars between Cambodians that have deprived us of 
economic gain and completely stalled progress. 
  The new Olympic market problem remains unresolved; the old 
Olympic market continues to spill into the streets, thus 
severely blocking traffic; the state airline continues to be 
stranded; and a number of petroleum companies, such as Total, 
are forced to wait and wait for answers from the government. 
Will there be any other investors coming in if the situation, 
the economic stability of the country, continues like this? 
  Nevertheless, while some companies are visibly hesitant, a 
few others are optimistic enough to carry on, such as Golden Sea 
Shipping, which provides express transportation in the 
provinces; PAD, which takes charge of the city's garbage 
disposal operations; and a U.S. electric power company. These 
companies are carrying on as if nothing serious is happening. 
  We do not know we will see an economy which truly serves 
development, or when an economic authority can be set up by the 
government to thrust the country forward. This is because 
people can see that the government is spending the bulk of its 
energy and funds on ensuring its own political and 
security-military stability. This is a factor that has stunted 
the growth of the economic authority, preventing it from 
becoming the decisive factor. We would like to know when will 
the investment law, the trade law, and the concept of giving 
priority to economic infrastructure all take effect so we can 
truly activate Cambodia's economy.

  [Text] Jakarta -- Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was admitted 
to a Jakarta hospital's intensive cardiac care unit on Wednesday 
for what officials would only say was "fatigue". 
  Dr. Budi Trisulo, Mr. Alatas' personal physician, confirmed 
yesterday that the 61-year old foreign minister had been 
hospitalized but declined to say more. 
  ANTARA National News Agency quoted Foreign Ministry 
spokesman 
Irawan Abidin as saying that doctors have ordered Mr. Alatas, a 
heavy smoker, to take a complete rest for at least two weeks. 
  That would mean that Mr. Alatas, who was appointed foreign 
minister in 1988, would be unable to attend a meeting of the 
Indonesia-Malaysia joint ministerial commission in Kuala Lumpur. 
He had also been scheduled to fly from Malaysia to Egypt to 
attend a meeting of the Nonaligned Movement's foreign ministers. 
  A key point on the Cairo agenda is the question of who 
succeeds Indonesia next year as chairman of the 110-strong 
movement.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Banks' Raised Deposit Rates"] </F>
  [Text] Even though earlier this week some state-owned 
commercial banks such as the BNI [Bank Negara Indonesia -- 
Indonesian State Bank] and BTN [Bank Tabungan Negara -- State 
Savings Bank] raised the interest rates on their deposits, they 
promised that the lending rates will not be raised. This was 
confirmed by Widigdo Sukarman, president director of BTN, and R. 
Syahdeiny, director of BNI, in conjunction with the announcement 
on the increase in the interest rates on deposits with maturity 
of one to three months by 0.5 percen to 9.5 percent effective 3 
May. 
  Briefing newsmen on Tuesday, the two state banks executives 
reiterated that the rise in the deposit rates will not be 
accompanied by a rise in the interest rates for credits. This 
is because commercial banks have to adjust their deposit rates 
to supply and demand conditions in the banking industry. Apart 
from that, the national banking industry is burdened with the 
task of achieving the credit expansion target to step up 
economic development. 
  It is not easy to maintain the lending rate at the same 
level 
all the time while the deposit rates tend to increase. This is 
because, according to the two bankers, these two types of bank 
interests are mutually influencing each other. 
  However, it is very important for the government to maintain 
the banks lending rates in effort to spur economic growth 
through the bank credit expansion scheme. As we all know, under 
the 1994/95 fiscal year the bank credit expansion is expected to 
grow by 18 percent. But now we doubt if the target could be 
achieved because of the recent increase in the interest rates on 
the deposits. 
  Lately, several private commercial banks raised the interest 
rates on deposits to comply with the development in the foreign 
financial market. The rise is linked to the 0.25 percentage 
point increase in the U.S. Federal Reserve rate from 3.50 
percent to 3.75 percent at the end of March. 
  Based on the record of the upward trend in the interest 
rates 
on deposits, several commercial banks last week raised their 
deposit rates for short-term maturity. As a matter of fact, the 
ABN [Algemene Bank Nederland] had increased the interest rates 
to about 0.5 percent point since the end of March on one to 
three months deposits and this was followed by Panin Bank and 
BDNI [Indonesian State Commercial Bank]. 
  Meanwhile, Bank Aken and Synergy Bank made adjustments to 
their deposit rates after banks in Singapore increased their 
deposit rates by an average of 0.25 percent. The signs that the 
state banks were going to increase the deposit rates were 
apparent since the beginning of March. 
  Observers of development in the foreign monetary system have 
anticipated that the bank interest rates will continue to rise 
phase by phase. According to their calculation, ideally, the 
interest rate on banks deposits should reach 14 percent, and the 
interest rate on lending should be about 20 percent. 
  We feel that the interest rates on long term deposits have 
been established, and they are expected to move upward to 
reflect the latest development in the financial market. 
However, it seems that the rise in the interest rates on banks 
deposits in Indonesia is not influenced by the foreign interest 
rates. It has been expected that the interest rates on banks 
deposits will be increased again in the second quarter of this 
year to keep pace with the high inflation rate. We also have 
take into consideration the economic and noneconomic factors 
that influence the domestic rates. The Bapindo [State National 
Development Bank] loan scandal case and the aftermath of the 
massive workers' demonstrations in Medan can also be considered 
as other influencial factors to the rising country risk 
[preceding two words in English]. 
  It is important that the government cautiously supervise the 
development of its macroeconomic policy, especially to ensure 
that the rate of inflation and the rate of depreciation remain 
stable. This is because the inflation rate has a strong 
influence on the deposit rates in the banking industry. 
  The government should create the monetary condition in the 
country such that it could be brought back to the position where 
it was in the beginning of this year, which would allow for 
credit expansion facilities. In this context, we feel that the 
monetary authorities should adopt a transparent attitude toward 
the current upward trend in the interest rates on banks deposits.

  [Text] Negotiations on insurance and automobiles and auto 
parts, two priority sectors in the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks, will resume on 1 and 2 June, respectively. 
  With regard to automobiles, the government plans to propose 
using the actual number of imports of finished cars as one 
"objective criterion," and that this criterion shall be 
monitored twice a year. It will also work for an agreement on 
steps to improve the standards and certification systems within 
1994 by calling for a meeting of experts to determine points of 
compromise. However, the United States is also expected to 
demand an increase in the voluntary plan for purchasing 
U.S.-made auto parts compiled recently by Japanese carmakers. 
Rough sailing is anticipated in the negotiations. 
  Division-chief class working level meetings on insurance are 
scheduled to reopen in Tokyo on 1 June, and similar meetings on 
automobiles and auto parts will start in Washington on 2 June. 
Subsequently, U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten and 
Deputy Vice Minister of International Trade and Industry 
Sozaburo Okamatsu will also hold vice-ministerial level meetings 
in Tokyo on 6 June to finalize the automobiles negotiations. 
  The Japanese Government will make concrete proposals on 
objective criteria in the negotiations on automobiles and auto 
parts. It will suggest using the following as basis: number of 
finished car imports, volume of auto parts purchase, number of 
right-hand drive U.S. cars entering the Japanese market, and 
others; and progress in these categories will be checked by both 
countries twice a year. 
  Concerning the issue of standards and certification, the 
United States has presented a list of 16 demands, including 
partial easing of standards for exhaust gas tests. The 
government will call for a joint meeting of Japanese and U.S. 
experts to discuss this problem. It takes the position that 
after listening to the details of the U.S. demands, "we will 
draw a conclusion on whether these demands are acceptable within 
1994." 
  At the regular meeting between the Transport Ministry and 
the 
American Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Japan to be held on 
27 May, before the resumption of the framework talks, the 
government will listen again to the U.S. Big Three carmakers' 
demands on the issue of standards and certification. It will 
also consider setting up a regular venue for dialogue between 
the Transport Ministry and the U.S. automobile industry. 
  In response to U.S. demands, five major Japanese carmakers 
led by Toyota Motors compiled their voluntary targets for 
additional purchases of U.S.-made auto parts after fiscal 1994. 
However, the United States remains unsatisfied, claiming 
"compared to the growth of Japanese cars produced in the United 
States, purchase of U.S.- made parts is too little." 
Furthermore, the United States also demands Japanese Government 
"guarantee" for these targets. Since the Japanese side is 
opposed to the latter demand, and a point of compromise has not 
been found, difficulties are expected in the upcoming 
negotiations. 
  On the other hand, with regard to insurance, Japan has taken 
the initiative to implement steps to clarify standards for 
issuing licenses and product certification, which is one of the 
U.S. demands. Therefore, the negotiations will concentrate on 
the focal issue of delaying the liberalization of the third 
sector insurance. Japanese life and non-life insurers are 
expected to be allowed to participate in this sector two years 
later. The United States is actually asking for a postponement 
of this measure. The Finance Ministry indicates that an 
agreement is near at hand, affirming "the negotiations have come 
to the stage of coordinating details of the final agreement." 
Final adjustments seem to be under way on how to incorporate 
the postponement of liberalization in the agreement.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 27 May Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Regarding the Office of U.S. Trade Representative's 
(USTR) including the "slowness of Japanese import procedures" as 
a new trade barrier in the "1994 Report on Foreign Trade 
Barriers," the Ministry of Finance [MOF] strongly refutes this 
as an "opinion based on misunderstanding." MOF claims that the 
report compares time needed for import procedures in Japan and 
the United States by different standards. It argues that "in 
terms of customs procedures, there is practically no disparity 
[in time needed] between Japan and the United States." 
  According to a survey conducted by the MOF in 1993, the 
average time needed for sea cargo to pass customs (obtain import 
permit) after the shipment arrives was 4.8 days, and for air 
cargo, 1.9 days. The USTR report claims that in the United 
States, "the average time needed to get import permit is around 
one minute," urging Japan to shorten time needed for import 
procedures. However, MOF contends that the fact is, "there is a 
gap in the idea of processing time." 
  In Japan, import declarations are filed and customs 
procedures started only after passing inspections required by 
laws not under MOF jurisdiction, such as food inspection or 
animal and plant quarantine (so-called non-customs procedures). 
In the United States, such non-customs procedures are taken 
after going through customs based on advance import 
declarations. That is, the difference between Japan and the 
United States is that non-customs procedures are taken before 
and after customs procedures, respectively. 
  Therefore, what the United States claims to take only "one 
minute" refers only to customs procedures not including the non- 
customs requirements. If the latter category is included, "the 
entire process can easily take more than two weeks," (according 
to a major Japanese trading firm). On the other hand, the 
United States questions the total time needed for both 
non-customs and customs procedures for imports in Japan. MOF 
takes the position that "this is an argument neglecting the 
disparity in definition."

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] began on 15 
May to study the possibility of Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa 
visiting the United States during June. The ministry did that 
because, in addition to the fact that the foreign minister 
himself very much wants to visit the United States at an early 
stage, the visit would "give the impression to the United States 
that there are signs of change" in resuming the Japan-U.S. trade 
framework talks, which is facing difficulties. However, it 
seems that the MOFA needs some time before reaching a 
conclusion, partly because the Diet schedule has to be taken 
into consideration, but also because some officials of the MOFA 
and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] are 
of the opinion that the situation is still "premature." 
  Ever since he was inaugurated to the ministerial post on 28 
April, Foreign Minister Kakizawa, in interviews and on other 
occasions, has voiced his strong desire to visit the United 
States at an early stage, saying: "I need to deal not only with 
the economic issues but also with North Korea's suspected 
nuclear arms development. It is also important for me to meet 
with senior U.S. Government officials soon to establish private 
and confidence-building relations with them." 
  Keeping in mind the issue of resuming the economic framework 
talks, an issue pending between Japan and the United States, the 
MOFA's administrative authorities expressed a negative stance 
regarding the foreign minister's trip to the United States at an 
early stage, saying: 1) the two nations are now in a 
cooling-off period following the breakdown of the framework 
talks with no prospects of resuming the talks in sight; 2) a 
visit by the foreign minister will encourage the United States 
to harbor excessive expectations that Japan may come up with 
compromises over the points at issue, including "objective 
criteria"; and 3) such a visit, on the contrary, will have a 
negative impact on Japan-U.S. relations if it fails to produce 
results. 
  However, some government officials and public opinion in the 
United States have begun to turn against the Clinton 
administration's hard-line policy, designed to urge Japan to 
compromise while hinting at the possibility of imposing 
sanctions. For these and other reasons, President Clinton said 
on 3 May that "the United States will not demand the acceptance 
of quotas or managed trade." During his telephone conversation 
with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 9 May, the president urged 
mutual effort to resume the framework talks. 
  Moreover, U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor, 
who 
had been leading others in criticizing Japan, on 10 May 
positively assessed Japan's stance shown during negotiations in 
individual areas, including the rice, construction, and cellular 
phone industries. In addition, U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher called Foreign Minister Kakizawa on the same day and 
said that "we will welcome your trip to the United States before 
the Naples summit." 
  Regarding such a series of movements on the part of the 
United States, MOFA analyzes that "there is a sign that the 
United States is softening its stance," according to a Foreign 
Ministry source. The MOFA thinks that the foreign minister's 
"trip to the United States before the summit will have its own 
political significance," according to a senior Foreign Ministry 
official. 
  However, it is also certain that there still exists a 
deep-rooted view that "although the atmosphere in the United 
States is changing, it has not changed its stance (of demanding 
that Japan set objective criteria)," according to the same 
senior official. It seems that the MOFA will "seek, while 
carefully observing how the situation will develop, the 
possibility of realizing the trip in June," according to a 
Foreign Ministry source.

  [Text] It was learned on 24 May that the Science and 
Technology and the Foreign Ministry held a briefing for foreign 
embassies on the outline revision of the nation's long-term plan 
for atomic energy development. The briefing was held following 
requests from several countries, and it was first time the 
government has attempted to explain a policy review before 
formal approval. 
  The responses of the foreign officials indicated their deep 
interest in Japan's plutonium policy, particularly the light of 
the controversy surrounding the DPRK's (North Korea's) nuclear 
policy. 
  The 20 May briefing was intended for science and technology 
specialists at foreign embassies. Officials were sent from the 
embassies of 11 countries, including energy-advanced nations 
such as the United States, the UK, France, and Germany, as well 
as Pacific nations such as Thailand, Indonesia, and Australia. 
  Officials of the Science and Technology Agency and the 
Foreign Ministry received those foreign officials, and explained 
the future direction of Japan's plutonium policy. During the 
90-minute briefing, Japanese officials passed out booklets of 
the draft plan written both in Japanese and English, and 
received questions from foreign officials after a lecture. 
  One of the attendants said they severely questioned Japanese 
officials "why Japan is so eager about development of fast 
breeder reactors," and "if construction of No.2 plutonium 
processing plant was postponed in view of the demand-supply 
balance of plutonium." Some of them reportedly requested Japan 
to explain its plutonium policy in their homelands since "our 
homeland is keenly interested in the issue." 
  The long-term plan on atomic energy development has never 
made public before formal approval by the government. However, 
the Atomic Energy Commission, the composer of the long-term 
plan, disclosed a draft plan on 18 May to secure the openness of 
Japan's energy policies in view of domestic and international 
criticism of Japan's policy on plutonium use. In response, the 
Science and Technology Agency and the Foreign Ministry received 
more than a dozen inquiries from foreign embassies in Tokyo. 
  The Science and Technology Agency said: "We decided to hold 
the briefing to help them understand the Japanese Government's 
policy to make clear its plutonium policy." 
  Commenting on this, the Foreign Ministry said: "More than 50 
countries expressed their strong interest in the shipment of 
plutonium to Japan last year. Japan cannot promote the use of 
plutonium without the understanding of the international 
community."

  [Text] Beijing, 24 May -- Japan and China started the 
first two-day negotiation meeting in Beijing on 23 May to talk 
abut the possibility of China becoming a member of GATT. As a 
condition for China to Join the GATT, Japan had called for a 
reduction of tariff rates on 3,300 industrial goods and China 
gave answers on 2,800 items. However, it seems that both 
countries need more time before reaching an agreement because, 
"there still exists a big gap" between their proposals 
(according to the Japanese negotiation team). 
  It will be the first full-fledged negotiation meeting 
between 
the two countries regarding China's joining GATT.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa spoke on the 
telephone for 10 minutes on the evening of 20 May with Yasushi 
Akashi, the UN Secretary General's special representative in 
charge of affairs in former Yugoslavia. On the issue of sending 
Japanese personnel to participate in the work of the UN 
Protection Forces (UNPRO), which are currently conducting 
operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kakizawa said: "It will be 
difficult to do so at the moment, but we would like to study the 
issue over the medium-to-long-term." 
  His comments indicated the government intends to consider 
plans to send Japanese personnel to participate in UN 
peacekeeping operations (PKO). In response, Akashi said: "We 
will continue to request deployment of Japanese personnel, but 
we would like the Japanese Government to avoid making hasty 
decisions and to study the issue from a broad perspective." 
  Kakizawa then said Japan plans to send a delegation to 
participate in a meeting of the Council for the Rehabilitation 
and Reconstruction of Sarajevo to be held in Vienna on 24-25 
May. He said Japan planned "to seriously consider whether it 
would be possible to offer wide-ranging cooperation." 
  His remarks indicated that Japan also intends to actively 
support rehabilitation and reconstruction programs after peace 
has been restored in the region. 
  Alluding to critical remarks made by some U.S. and European 
officials against Akashi, Kakizawa said: "I praise Mr. Akashi 
highly for preventing the situation from worsening and 
maintaining UN neutrality. I also support his way of doing 
things." 
  Akashi said: "It is natural that there is criticism, so I do 
not mind that at all. I would like to continue securing UN 
neutrality."

  [Text] The government announced on 23 May a decision to 
ban exports to and merchant trade with Haiti by revising part of 
the Foreign Exchange Control Order and the Export Trade Control 
Order. The measure has been taken in line with a full-scale UN 
embargo against Haiti to oust the country's military government 
from power. 
  Japan will start an import embargo against Haiti on 27 May 
after revising the orders on 24 May. 
  The government's newly decided economic sanctions against 
Haiti comprise: 1) a ban on the export of all cargoes to Haiti, 
and 2) a ban on merchant trade with Haiti. 
  Japan made the announcement following the UN Security 
Council's decision to impose a full-scale embargo against Haiti 
to urge the Haiti military government to step down and restore 
civilian rule. 
  Japanese exports to Haiti in 1993 were worth about 600 
million yen.

  [Text] Major General Lukyanov, deputy chief of the Russian 
Defense Ministry International Treaty Directorate, who is on a 
visit to Japan, met Ken Sato, defense councilor, at the Defense 
Agency [DA] on 19 May. They discussed the DPRK's suspected 
development of nuclear arms, and agreed that this problem should 
be resolved through dialogue. This is the first time Japanese 
and Russian defense officials have shared a common view on the 
North Korean issue. 
  Sato also suggested a visit to Moscow by Naoaki Murata, 
director general of the DA Defense Policy Bureau, in 1994. 
Lukyanov agreed in principle. Exchanges between the two 
countries on defense matters started two years ago at the 
councilor level. [If Murata's visit materializes,] this will be 
the first exchange at the bureau director general level.

  [Text] On 19 May, a Foreign Ministry source said the UK 
has asked Japan through diplomatic channels to stop extending 
yen loans to Iran. Japan resumed yen loan programs to Iran 
starting in May 1993. The UK has made the request for reasons 
such as Iran's support for terrorist activities conducted by 
radical groups that advocate Islamic Fundamentalism. 
  The UK is the second nation, following the United States, to 
ask Japan to stop extending yen loans to Iran. The Japanese 
Government has judged that it has become increasingly likely 
that the Iranian issue will be a key topic at the July Naples 
summit. It has therefore made firm its plan to stop extending 
yen loans to Iran for this year, tentatively until the 
conclusion of the Naples summit. 
  However, depending on the outcome of the Naples summit, it 
can be expected that the government may face further difficulty 
regarding the second phase of yen loans to Iran. The government 
is likely to be pressed to make a difficult political decision 
on whether or not to continue extending yen loans to Iran.

  [Text] A multiparty signature-collecting campaign will be 
conducted by lower house members who want the next general 
election under a new electoral system. The campaign is to be 
led by members of reformist groups in the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. 
Some coalition party members are also expected to join. The 
campaign was conceived in response to a proposal from the 
Committee for the Promotion of Political Reform (chairman: Masao 
Kamei), a private panel organized by business and labor leaders. 
Nearly 70 lower house members -- more than 40 from the LDP and 
more than 20 from the SDPJ -- intend to meet on 26 May to 
promote the campaign. Some LDP and SDPJ members are seeking an 
early general election before work has finished on the allotment 
of single-seat constituencies. The campaign is likely to 
exercise considerable influence on the direction the 
coalition-opposition struggle takes over the issue of dissolving 
the lower house because it is being led by reformists from the 
two opposition parties. 
  The campaigning LDP and SDPJ lawmakers have decided to 
jointly conduct the collection of signatures prompted by concern 
about moves to have the next election under the old multi-seat 
system. They feel this would "ruin efforts so far to win 
electoral and political reform." The campaign is largely 
supported by those who have been trying hard to get the 
political reform bills enacted. 
  From the LDP, more than 40 members of the Dietmen's League 
on 
Political Reform will join the campaign. These include Yuji 
Tsushima, Takeshi Noda, Koji Hosaka, Akihiko Noro, and Takeo 
Kawamura. Participants from the SDPJ include about 20 members 
of the rightist "Democrats" group such as Tadayoshi Morii, 
Kazunari Inoue, and Masao Sakon. In addition, several members 
will join the campaign from each of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], Komeito, the Japan New Party, the Democratic Socialist 
Party, Sakigake [Harbinger], and New Party Mirai. 
  The Committee for the Promotion of Political Reform is 
scheduled to announce on 26 May an emergency advisory report 
calling for: 1) a general election under the new electoral 
system; 2) further promotion of political and administrative 
reform; and 3) enforcement of political ethics and the 
reinforcement of anti-corruption measures. Following the 
announcement, the lawmakers will hold the first meeting of the 
campaign to adopt a "political reform declaration" based on the 
private panel's three-point proposal. 
  The signature-collection campaign is intended to obtain 
support from the majority of lower house members. It is 
believed reformist lawmakers are trying to discourage the idea 
of calling an early election under the multi-seat system before 
the political scene begins to shift toward an "attempt to oppose 
political reform."

  [Text] Japan will slow down its plutonium-related 
projects, a subpanel of the (prime minister's) advisory Atomic 
Energy Commission said in its report submitted on 18 May. The 
policy change was made in view of global concern over Japan's 
plutonium policy. On the other hand, the advisory report again 
stressed the need for continued studies on plutonium use, 
without indicating future directions of the project. The 
inadequateness of the report reflects frictions between the 
Science and Technology Agency [STA], which is seeking the 
promotion of nuclear fuel recycling, and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI], which takes a prudent 
stance toward plutonium use. The industrial circles are voicing 
concern over the unclear policy review because they always 
become the sole sufferers from inadequate policies. 
Speculations [subhead] 
  The advisory report by the Atomic Energy Commission is 
expected to become the outline of the government's new long-term 
program for atomic energy development, which will be revised for 
the first time in seven years. Therefore, STA and MITI 
finalized the report by carefully adjusting the interests of 
both sides. 
  For STA, nuclear fuel recycling is a big-scale and long-term 
project which guarantees much expenditures and manpower 
mobilization. STA cannot accept the scaledown of the project 
since the project is a "centerpiece" to demonstrate its presence 
in Kasumigaseki [bureaucratic circles]. On the other hand, MITI 
is looking for good excuses for checking STA's initiative. 
Based on studies by the (MITI minister's advisory) General 
Energy Council, a top MITI official recently stated: "The 
government should slow down its plutonium-related projects." 
  The experimental fast breeder reactor "Monju" cost the 
government over 600 billion yen, and in the next stage, electric 
power companies plan to build a demonstration reactor. The 
government intends to add nuclear fuel recycling costs to the 
price of plutonium, and the companies will have to buy the 
expensive fuel. MITI says it has to speak out for "silent 
complaints" from electric power companies. Since the ministry 
is in charge of Japan-U.S. relations, it has to give 
consideration to the U.S. policy on the DPRK's (North Korea's) 
nuclear weapons development. 
Concern [subhead] 
  Atomic energy-related products occupy about 10 percent of 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Limited's total annual sales. The 
company has over 1,000 engineers working in this field. In 
response to the governmental decision on the setback in 
plutonium use, the company expressed its concern over the policy 
review, saying: "In line with the policy review, we will have 
to slow down our technological studies." 
  According to the Atomic Energy Industries Council, the total 
amount of nuclear-related projects in 1992 reached 2.24 trillion 
yen. These contracts were received by 470 companies, including 
electric applicant manufacturers, heavy machinery builders, and 
constructors. 
  Taking subcontractors into account, the "atomic power 
business" involves many companies. For the last five years, 
there have been no plans for constructing new nuclear-power 
plants due to difficulties in finding local government bodies 
willing to accept nuclear-related facilities. Under such 
circumstances, "We are not happy" about a possible delay in 
orders for nuclear recycling facilities (as noted by a major 
electric appliance company). Yet, "We cannot move engineers to 
other sections because it narrows future business chances" (as 
noted by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries). 
  In addition, the advisory report imposes on the business 
sector a duty to provide a nuclear fuel processing plant for 
consuming surplus plutonium. The plutonium business costs 
companies a lot, no matter which ones remain or withdraw from 
the business field, and it will certainly hit consumers in the 
future as a utility fee hike. Dilemma in the unclear nuclear 
policy will inevitably trouble the business sector and consumers.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazuteru Yoshikawa of Science and Technology </F>
Department] 
  [Text] The news caused an uproar that no less than 70 kg of 
plutonium was found in the production lines of a plutonium fuel 
production facility (Tokai-mura, Ibaragi Prefecture) of the 
Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation [PNC], 
which had accumulated over approximately six years since the 
plant went into operation. This may lower the reliability of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, which 
prevents diversion of nuclear materials to military use, and the 
image of Japan, which takes pride in being "IAEA's model 
student," is greatly damaged. It is whispered that the incident 
may stimulate world opinion, including the United States, which 
is critical of Japan's use of plutonium. 
<H5>  Enough Plutonium To Make More Than Eight Atomic Bombs </H5>
  The news came to light after Paul Leventhal, president of 
the 
Nuclear Control Institute, a U.S. organization critical of 
Japan's nuclear power policy, obtained information that a huge 
amount of plutonium was stuck to the equipment of the fuel 
plant, and asked the U.S. State Department to seek the 
facility's shutdown. 
  At the end of April, immediately before the incident was 
brought to light, the IAEA had directed Japan to reduce the 
amount of plutonium adhering to the equipment during an annual 
meeting with the Japanese Government. Using a neutron measuring 
instrument called "Holdup Measuring Equipment" at the plant, the 
IAEA had checked whether the amount of plutonium sticking to the 
equipment agrees with the amount reported by the PNC, which runs 
the facility. 
  However, since the measuring equipment has a margin of error 
of 10-15 percent, 8 kilograms -- which is a "significant 
quantity" for the production of a nuclear bomb -- falls within 
the range of error when the amount of holdup is 70 kg. This 
means that 8 kg of plutonium could escape detection even when 
the amount is cooked up with evil intentions, and the PNC had 
already been working on full- scale measures to improve the 
situation when the news was brought to light. 
<H5>  "Aim at Reducing Plutonium by Half for the Moment" </H5>
  Since the beginning of the factory's operation, 
approximately 
3 tons of plutonium have been brought in the production lines, 
and about 2.3 percent of the amount has been left inside the 
equipment. It is difficult to judge whether this percentage of 
holdup is large or small because there are only a small number 
of plutonium fuel production facilities in the world. The 
process of making plutonium fuel is similar to that of medicine, 
in which tablets are made by compressing powder. "In the 
process of manufacturing tablets, about 2 percent of the powder 
material is lost," according to Sankyo Co., Ltd., a drug 
manufacturer. 
  The fuel factory produces cylindrical fuel pellets (diameter 
5 mm, height 8 mm) for the fast breeder reactor "Monju." The 
mixture of plutonium and uranium powder is processed in the 
following way: granulation, casting, sintering, grinding, and 
inspection. To avoid exposure to radioactivity, the production 
lines are sealed in containers called glove boxes, and operators 
work behind safety glass with gloves. 
  Of the 30 glove boxes in total, plutonium holdup was 
confirmed in 17. In particular, a large amount of plutonium 
sludge was found in the casting lines (two), where the powder is 
shaped into pellets, and the grinding line, where the surface of 
a sintered pellet is smoothed. The combined total holdup in 
those three lines was 40 kg. 
  In the casting process, the powder scatters when the source 
material in a mold is pressed vertically from both directions. 
In the grinding process, shaved powder was not collected 
completely. The powder that accumulated where the workers could 
not reach, such as the back of the equipment, had to be left as 
it was. 
  To collect the plutonium residue completely, the production 
lines have to be stopped. But, especially for the last one or 
two years, priority was reportedly given to the production of 
fuel to meet the critical state of "Monju," and there was no 
time for cleaning. 
  For the moment, the PNC has to reduce the amount of 
plutonium holdup so that the amount that falls within the range 
of measurement error becomes much lower than the significant 
quantity of 8 kg. "To reduce 70 kg by half is our goal for the 
time being," according to the PNC Nuclear Fuel Facility Planning 
Department. 
  Casting and grinding equipment, where plutonium was stuck 
intensely, have already been replaced with the new ones, which 
are designed to allow less scattering of plutonium powder. 
"Increase in the amount of residue must be smaller than 
before," the PNC said. The old equipment will be dismantled and 
cleaned, and the plutonium will be collected. 
<H5>  The United States Attempts To Undermine Japan? </H5>
  Overseas reaction to the news, such as that of the U.S. 
Government which is sensitive to Japan's use of plutonium, 
weighs on our minds. The Japan-U.S. Nuclear Agreement 
stipulates that the United States, which supplies enriched 
uranium, a source for plutonium, can seek a facility's shutdown, 
if Japan commits a serious violation of safeguards. Leventhal's 
advice to the State Department had this in mind. 
  However, Japan's Science and Technology Agency does not seem 
to worry about this point: "It is certainly a problem that the 
amount of plutonium adhering to the equipment was large, but it 
is not a serious violation because the plutonium is not missing" 
(Atomic Energy Bureau). Rather, the agency's Atomic Energy 
Bureau is interested in "why a private U.S. organization got the 
information at this time." 
  Regarding plutonium, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has 
recently complained, which is unusual, about the content of the 
PNC's video for public relations. That the United States is 
irritated by the fact that Japan has begun to use plutonium 
seriously is well known. About how the information of plutonium 
holdup came to light this time, not a few people concerned think 
of it as "a U.S. attempt to undermine Japan in an indirect way."

  [Text] Geneva, 19 May -- During a working group session of 
the Geneva disarmament conference on 19 May, under which 
negotiations on concluding a treaty on comprehensive test ban 
are in progress, the Japanese Government presented a proposal 
that will be the basis for the draft accord. The proposal 
incorporates a nuclear inspection system consisting of the three 
on-site inspection methods -- seismological inspection method, a 
method to inspect radioactive fallout, and an international 
inspection method -- as means to inspect nuclear tests conducted 
secretly. 
  At the working session, Yoshitomo Tanaka, ambassador 
accredited to the Geneva disarmament conference, announced for 
the first time that a comprehensive inspection system should be 
established after coordinating and incorporating each nation's 
own inspection methods into Japan-proposed system. He then 
asked the member nations to conclude negotiations by the time 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is extended next April.

  [Excerpt] On 23 May, general interpellations on the 
government-proposed budget bill for fiscal 1994 began at the 
House of Representatives' Budget Committee. The committee 
session opened at 10:00 AM and was attended by all Cabinet 
members, including Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. This was the 
first full Diet deliberation following the Hata Cabinet's 
inauguration. The first interpellator was Takashi Fukaya, a 
Budget Committee director and member of the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP]. He questioned the government's views on the 
relationships between "universal security" and "collective 
security." In response, the prime minister said: "Universal 
security is a bit broader in concept than collective security, 
as defined by the UN Charter. But since collective security 
constitutes an important factor of universal security, I think 
it is almost the same as universal security." In this way, the 
prime minister made clear that the concepts of collective and 
universal security are the same. Moreover, he said the term 
"international security" "could be used the same as universal 
security in meaning." 
  Asked whether the Constitution overrides the UN Charter in 
deciding policies such as international contributions, the prime 
minister said: "The Constitution prevails over international 
agreements and thus, it overrides the UN Charter." He also 
said: "Japan will act within the Constitution's framework" 
although Chapter Seven of the UN Charter calls for military 
actions by member states. 
  [passage omitted on reasons for the delay in holding 
deliberations and on another question raised by Fukaya 
concerning recent remarks by Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) 
Secretary General Ozawa that were considered to be disrespectful 
toward women]

  [Text] The "Defense Policy Council" (chaired by Asahi 
Breweries Ltd. Chairman Hirotaro Higuchi), a private advisory 
body to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, held a meeting at the prime 
minister's official residence on the morning of 25 May, and 
exchanged views on the international situation after the end of 
the Cold War. It was confirmed that "it is necessary to prevent 
regional disputes and proliferation of mass destruction arms 
because there are isolated and unpredictable dangers in various 
places." Taking such a situation into consideration, the 
council agreed that "Japan should take positive actions to 
resolve international problems," and decided to make this view 
the framework of a report to be submitted to the prime minister. 
  With regard to the Asian and Pacific situation, the 
participants cited the following as important issues: 1) while 
the economy in this region is steadily developing, its security 
system is immature; 2) interests of the major military powers, 
such as the United States, Russia, and China, are entangled. 
The council decided to state in the report its view that 
Japan's defense capability "will become an increasingly 
important component for the security environment of the Asian 
and Pacific region."

<F P=106> [Article by Tsuneo Yoshihara, editor and military analyst </F>
with JIJI PRESS and researcher at JIJI Research Institute: "How 
Far Japan Can Go Under Domestic Laws in Case of Emergencies"] 
  [Text] Nonmilitary Measures -- Economic Sanctions 
Naturally Bring Disadvantages 
  The DPRK is racing ahead with its nuclear armaments, in 
spite 
of criticism from the international community; United Nations 
sanctions on that country are set to be gradually strengthened. 
Once sanctions are applied, naturally Japan will be asked to 
follow suit. Furthermore, it is more likely than not that Japan 
will be asked to play a central role in sanction activities, 
because the DPRK, the target of the sanctions, is a neighboring 
country and has an important effect on Japan's security. 
  The government has made its policy clear that "it will do 
its 
utmost within the framework of the Constitution." Whenever the 
matter of sanctions is raised, however, what matters is legal 
limitations. In the post-Cold War international community, 
increase in various sanctions, including those by the United 
Nations, is expected, not excepting the recent DPRK case. 
Therefore, it is most urgent to examine how much Japan can do 
under the present laws and what kinds of legal preparations are 
necessary to fulfill international obligations. 
  In the international community during the Cold War, the two 
super powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, played the 
roles of "world police." Other countries had no need to 
participate even if they were asked to go in tune with military 
sanctions, and could manage just by making gestures of going 
along with it when nonmilitary sanctions were applied. In the 
post-Cold War international community, however, it became 
inevitable to maintain order by cooperation among leading 
nations. Thus, UN-initiated sanction activities are on the 
increase, and Japan, a leading nation, cannot avoid taking part 
in such activities. 
  During Cold War days, Japan participated in nonmilitary 
sanction activities on many occasions. A typical example was an 
economic sanction against southern Rhodesia following a UN 
resolution. When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, Japan 
was asked to participate in the U.S.-initiated economic 
sanctions but took only a cooperative pose. Against the DPRK, 
Japan followed suit in nonmilitary sanctions following the 1983 
Rangoon bombing assassination attempt against the ROK president 
and the 1987 Korean Air bombing incident. Fresh in our memories 
is Japan's following suit in the post-Cold War sanctions against 
Iraqi aggression of Kuwait. 
  In Japan, it has been emphasized that "international 
disputes 
should not be settled by military means." But when it was asked 
to participate in economic sanctions -- a powerful nonmilitary 
measure -- cautious views were dominant at all times in that 
"effects of sanctions are dubious because damage to be suffered 
by Japan is larger than that afflicted on the subjected 
country." In an international society that has a diversified 
sense of value, economic sanctions in many cases end up 
incompletely enforcing effective embargo measures as intended. 
This tendency will be accelerated due to the multipolarization 
of international society following the Cold War's end. In that 
sense, the aforementioned view seems to be right. 
  However, that view is based on a misunderstanding about 
economic sanctions. Economic sanctions are political acts, 
despite the modifier "economic" found in the term. Economic 
activities are meaningless if they end up in red figures. On 
the other hand, expenses are required if political activities 
are to achieve desired objectives. So, the minus figures earned 
by sanctions are expenses as a matter of fact. Economic 
sanctions force the subjected country to make sacrifices and 
change its policy and at the same time they underline the 
intention of protests that the counterpart activities will not 
be tolerated at the cost of damages on the part of the 
protesting country. In the latter's case, the larger the minus 
figures on the part of sanction enforcing countries, the 
stronger the intention of the protests. With this in mind, let 
me examine how far Japan can participate in various sanction 
acts under the existing laws. 
  These sanctions may be classified into three categories: 
nonmilitary, semimilitary, and military. The nonmilitary 
sanctions will restrict the subjected country's flow of men, 
goods, and money. Japan has participated in this kind of 
sanction. In the sanctions against the DPRK in connection with 
the Rangoon assassination attempt and the Korean Airlines 
bombing incident, movement of men was restricted according to 
existing laws and ordinances as follows: 1) restriction of 
contacts among diplomats, 2) banning, in principle, national 
public service personnel from making trips to the DPRK, 3) 
banning, in principle, the entry to Japan of public service 
personnel and more strict entry examination of private citizens 
from the DPRK, 4) banning special aircraft from flying into 
Japanese airports, and so on. 
  If the DPRK adamantly continues to refuse the IAEA from 
inspecting nuclear facilities, the UN Security Council will most 
likely define the DPRK act as a "threat to peace" as defined in 
Article 39 of the UN Charter and adopt a resolution to impose 
economic sanctions in accordance with Article 41 of the charter. 
They include such measures as restricting or stopping trade and 
remittances, and further freezing DPRK overseas assets. In the 
beginning, they will be moderate but they will gradually become 
stricter with eyes on the DPRK response. 
  Whatever shape economic sanctions take and Japan is asked 
to follow, such a precedent as the sanctions against Iraq will 
make it possible for Japan to fully respond with the existing 
laws and ordinances. In restricting and or stopping trade, the 
international trade and industry minister can restrict or stop 
it in accordance with the provision of Article 25 of the Foreign 
Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Act says that if "it is 
deemed to interfere with the maintenance of the international 
peace and security." 
  In imposing sanctions on the DPRK, the most effective and 
decisive measure is said to be stopping remittances from Japan 
of money estimated at 60 billion yen a year as well as an oil 
embargo. This kind of stoppage of remittances of various kinds 
of money can be handled by amendments to the finance minister's 
notice and there is no need for amendments to laws. As a means 
of sending money, quite a few travelers to the DPRK take cash 
with them. This can be dealt with by amendments to the finance 
minister's notice and by enforcing strict checking at harbors 
and airports. As a matter of fact, it is extremely difficult to 
legally restrict or ban the remittances through or via 
enterprises in third countries. Thus, there is a strong 
possibility that restricting or stopping remittances may become 
ineffective, but it is significant in stressing the intent of 
protest that Japan will not tolerate the DPRK's nuclear 
armaments. 
<H5>  Semimilitary Sanctions -- Logistic Support and Sea Blockade </H5>
  What matters next is legal problems arising from Japan's 
cooperation with semimilitary sanctions. For this, examining 
the problems at five levels becomes necessary. 
  The first is related to participation and cooperation with 
UN 
peace keeping activities. In this connection, a prerogative 
interpretation has been made to the effect that sharing 
expenses, surveillance, supply, transportation, construction of 
facilities, and communications and medical activities in areas 
of dispute" are not construed to be use of force prohibited by 
the Constitution." And part of these activities were already 
brought into effect following the enactment of the Law on 
Cooperation in UN Peacekeeping Operations [PKO]. There will be 
no legal complications in cooperating, except for political 
judgment, with the United Nations, if ever its peacekeeping 
forces are to be dispatched to the Korean peninsula. 
  The second problem is participation and or cooperation with 
activities mentioned before by multinational forces, which in 
the future become the central part of peace enforcing 
activities. When the multinational forces with the United 
States as the core become involved in military sanctions against 
the DPRK, Japan will face the issue. Legal problems pertaining 
to sharing the costs have already been cleared during the Gulf 
war days. Multinational forces are expected to take action 
under the authority given by the United Nations, so there is 
little problem under present laws. The participation in 
noncombat activities will become possible, however, if the PKO 
cooperation law and some of its provisions are amended. 
  The third problem is related to how to respond to logistic 
supply when armed conflicts take place in neighboring countries, 
including the Korean peninsula, and the United Nations uses 
military intervention. In other words, there are legal problems 
that will arise when Japan is used as a base of sorties, 
supplies, and repairs and maintenance of weapons. If an armed 
conflict occurs in the Korean peninsula, which is in a state of 
cease-fire, it is the resumption of combat between UN forces in 
Korea and DPRK forces, reviving the already existing Agreement 
Regarding the Status of UN Forces in Japan and Japan will be 
obliged to execute support services to eight nations, including 
the U.S., the UK, France, and so on. To let other countries 
make use of Japanese facilities, there will be a need either to 
amend the existing agreement regarding the status of UN forces 
in Japan or sign another agreement with Diet consent. 
  It becomes necessary to sign a new agreement on the status 
of 
forces when armed conflicts occur in neighboring countries other 
than the Korean peninsula and the United Nations decides on 
armed intervention and to use Japan for bases. The existing 
agreement regarding the status of the UN forces was signed under 
the present Constitution and there has never been any 
significant interpretation construing it unconstitutional. 
Therefore, there will be no legal problems in signing a new 
agreement on the status of forces. It is a policy judgment 
problem. 
  The fourth problem is related to a case when the 
multinational forces, that include U.S. forces, make armed 
intervention in armed conflicts in Japan's neighboring countries 
and want to use Japan for bases in the rear. As for the United 
States, it can use them when both Japan and the United States, 
in prior consultations, agree that it is necessary "to 
contribute to maintenance of international peace and security in 
the Far East," as provided in Article 6 of the Treaty of Mutual 
Cooperation and Security between Japan and the United States. 
If U.S. utilization is constitutional, utilization by 
multinational forces can be constitutional, too. Only in the 
latter's case, another law or agreement on the status of forces 
becomes necessary, if Japan decides to let the multinational 
forces use Japan for bases. 
  Meanwhile, supplying materials including oil to U.S. 
warships on the high seas by Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force 
[SDF] is possible under the SDF Law as long as the condition 
that "there are no hindrances" is met as provided in Article 29 
of the Commodities Law. But for other countries, it is 
understood there is a need to make an apparent mention about it 
in the SDF Law. 
  The fifth is legal problems in the case of participating in 
military actions taken to effectuate economic blockade. The 
action of blockade at issue here is not a "wartime blockade" as 
part of military operations, but a "peacetime blockade" in 
general terms. Therefore, the use of military force is not 
indispensable as in wartime blockade. But, as a matter of fact, 
some naval and ground forces are still used in parallel with the 
major component, naval forces, in many cases to make a blockade 
effective. In Japan, not a few take an economic blockade as a 
"nonmilitary measure," but in fact, it should be regarded as a 
"semimilitary measure." 
  Joining in blockade activities is not intended as a "use of 
arms" but there may be cases of firing arms and shelling as a 
warning to ships that refuse to lie to for searches. Because of 
this, it is feared that the act may conflict with the 
government's present prerogative interpretation. In addition, 
there is an interpretation that construes it "legally 
impossible," since there are no provisions of duty on the 
participation in sanction activities in duty regulations in 
either the SDF Law or the Maritime Safety Agency [MSA] Law. 
  The Defense Agency revealed that Japan's participation in 
sea 
blockades "will be dealt with first by coordination with the 
MSA's patrol ships and seaplanes and if they are found 
insufficient, the SDF may be called upon" for support. Defense 
Councilor Ken Sato presented an opinion to the Liberal 
Democratic Party section related to national defense that "it is 
possible that SDF aircraft or ships are dispatched to the scene 
if it is within the territory or territorial waters." But this 
sort of interpretation is so unique that it is applicable only 
in Japan. The MSA is in charge of police activities for 
maintaining public peace and order and its activities are 
restricted, except for exercising the right of hot pursuit, 
within the territory and exclusive economic zone. By 
international law, it is limited to armed forces that can carry 
out blockades on the high seas adjacent to the territorial 
waters of the country against which a blockade is imposed. 
  In the blockade against Haiti, the U.S. Coast Guard is 
participating with the U.S. Navy, because the Coast Guard is one 
of the five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. Meanwhile, 
Japan's MSA is not a part of the SDF -- armed forces. 
Therefore, the MSA's government ships do not have the authority 
to board and search on the high seas authorized by international 
law to naval ships of other countries and Japan's Maritime SDF. 
  In the SDF Law are found Article 84, covering measures 
against violation of territorial air space, and Article 82, 
covering guarding activities at sea. The Japanese Government 
seems to interpret these two provisions as "police activities," 
but in foreign countries, they are a part of defense activities 
in a stage still far from full-scale military actions. Retired 
Major General Hiroki Miyazaki, one of those who helped writing 
the SDF Law, said these activities are intended for defense 
activities in the stage not quite up to issuing sailing (or 
marching) orders for defense. Therefore, it is possible to 
participate in peacetime blockade activities by making little 
amendments to the provision covering guarding activities at sea. 
<H5>  Military Sanctions -- Is Dispatch of SDF Possible? </H5>
  Next comes the problem of participation in international 
sanction activities. At present, the government interprets the 
Constitution as allowing only use of arms in "self-defense," but 
bans any acts beyond it, like the exercise of rights to 
collective self-defense; something like dispatching self-defense 
forces abroad for the purpose of use of arms. Until before the 
time of the Ikeda cabinet, however, the exercise of rights to 
collective self-defense was not construed unconstitutional and 
until very recently it was interpreted that what the 
Constitution bans is "war as a means of settling international 
disputes," thus leaving room to permit international sanction 
activities as the matter of fact. 
  For Japan to participate in international military 
sanctions, 
there are three choices: The first is to delete the second 
section of Article 9 of the Constitution, end the queer 
interpretation that only passes in Japan and make legal the 
interpretation in accordance with legal theories and common 
sense that can pass in the international community. It is an 
internationally accepted theory that what the first section bans 
is aggressive wars but sanctions or international sanction 
activities are out of question. Even without inserting a 
provision regarding rights to collective self-defense, and 
according to the science of law, acknowledgement of rights 
include permission of exercise. It is just like the 
acknowledgement of freedom of speech includes permission of the 
exercise of such freedom in writing and speech-making. But this 
choice has the political hurdle that constitutional amendments 
are extremely difficult to make. 
  The second is to open the way to participating in military 
sanctions, as part of "international security," as an entirely 
different concept found in the report of the Ozawa Investigating 
Committee of the LDP. [The term "international security" was 
created by the Ozawa committee] The same report, based on a 
tacit premise that exercising the right to collective 
self-defense violates the Constitution, interprets international 
security as constitutional. 
  However, this interpretation also has a fault, because the 
right to collective self-defense originates from the similar 
legal concept of international security. U.S. defense reports 
have mainly dealt with matters relating to alliance based on the 
right to collective self-defense and it was only two or three 
years ago when they began dealing with matters relating to 
collective security, such as PKO. NATO is a typical alliance 
based on the right to collective self-defense and at the same 
time it bears the character of a regional organization of the 
collective security system of the United Nations. Therefore, it 
is hardly possible that one is constitutional while the other is 
not. 
  Military sanctions that Japan can participate in based on 
the 
theory of constitutionality of international security have not 
been organized so far and they are restricted to regular UN 
forces, which are difficult to form. Therefore, they cannot be 
answers to the problems we face. As was learned from the 
Somalia case, it must be remembered that conflicts with 
comparatively low intensity can be dealt with by UN peacekeeping 
activities but that the multinational forces method must be 
employed in compulsorily enforcing peace of high intensity. 
  The third method is to alter the government's prerogative 
interpretation in a way to make exercise of the right of 
collective self-defense and international acts of sanctions 
constitutional for the time being, with constitutional 
amendments to that effect in later days. It is proper to say, 
in view of dealing with the Diet and the power balance, that it 
is returning the present government interpretation, which is 
conspicuously against legal principles and international common 
sense, to its original place where it belonged. The people find 
this kind of interpretation easier to understand than forcing 
the way through by a sophistry that "hahei [despatching troops] 
is unconstitutional, while haken [sending them] is not." It 
must be prepared to face greater resistance from bureaucrats of 
the cabinet legislation bureau who attach importance to piles of 
past interpretations and from defense bureaucrats who find 
comfort in the present interpretation, in addition to resistance 
from forces insisting on "Constitution protection" and those old 
guards who do not want changes in the present status regardless 
of reasons. 
  However, the aforementioned three choices are applicable 
when 
armed conflicts in neighboring countries, including the Korean 
peninsula, are not extended to Japan. In the event of organized 
attacks against Japan, varied by degrees of their extension, it 
will be possible to take defensive actions by initiating 
"defense mobilization" in accordance with the SDF Law. For 
example, the present prerogative interpretation makes it 
possible to counterattack launching bases with aircraft and so 
on, if the DPRK attacked Japan by missiles. But, even in that 
case, it is said that the present interpretation does not permit 
sending ground troops to the Korean peninsula. 
  For emergency evacuation of Japanese nationals from 
countries 
and areas engulfed in armed conflicts, it is said that the use 
of SDF aircraft or ships is not unconstitutional but they cannot 
be used because of a lack of legal support. Although the ruling 
and opposition parties agreed to deal with the problem of using 
SDF aircraft in such emergencies by adding amendments to the SDF 
Law, the plan was stillborn in the midst of confusion of 
political reform bill deliberations. 
<H5>  Use of Military Power Subject To International Law </H5>
  As for participation in international sanctions, the passive 
people in Japan halt the thought by raising such reasons as 
"unconstitutional" or "without legal provisions." Granted, even 
if they are unconstitutional or violate laws, such 
interpretations are not a conclusion for politicians. If it is 
judged necessary politically, it is a beginning for adjusting 
such laws. 
  As discussed above, existing laws and ordinances are 
sufficient to launch nonmilitary measures and it is apparent 
that quite a few semimilitary measures can also be put into 
practice. As for military measures, a certain amount can be 
dealt with, if sophisticated or self-contradicted replies made 
toward opposition arguments of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan and the Japan Communist Party were altered in their 
interpretation on the basis of international common sense and 
legal principles. Therefore, it can be said that the government 
is evading its political judgment with the excuse of 
unconstitutionality and inadequate laws. 
  It does not end there. As commentator Mr. Kenichi Takemura 
pointed out: "World common sense is absurdity to Japan and 
Japan's common sense is absurdity to the world." A typical 
example is the interpretation of and attitude toward the laws 
regarding activities of the SDF, armed forces by international 
law. In foreign countries [and pre-World War II Japan], there 
is no need for provisions in domestic laws over the exercise of 
national power in the international community, such as military 
power, and it is a basic rule for this exercise to follow 
international law and practice. 
  However, every nation has enacted laws and ordinances on 
rules of hostilities in the exercise of military power in 
international society. This is aimed first to restrain such 
acts from going beyond the framework permitted by international 
law or practice in consideration of political as well as moral 
matters; and secondly, it is due to the situation that the 
domestic society's support is indispensable in taking such 
military action. Therefore, it does not mean that no action can 
be taken because no domestic laws or ordinances mention them, 
but it does mean that actions can be taken in accordance with 
international law and practice. 
  In this connection, it is necessary to clearly state in 
domestic laws the authority to use military power within one's 
society, including involvement in disaster relief activities to 
provide help to people in need as well as to maintain public 
peace and order with the possibility of using arms against its 
own people. In these cases, actions should be taken in 
accordance with domestic laws and ordinances and arms can only 
be used in cases allowed by domestic laws and ordinances. 
  After World War II, why did the interpretation that the SDF 
cannot take any international action due to lack of legal 
provisions, contrary to cases of various foreign countries, 
become "an accepted theory?" The reasons are: 1. Due to 
neglect on the part of the government, the legal interpretation 
made at the time of the police reserve force for maintaining 
public peace and order still drags on even after it developed 
into the SDF, armed forces with national defense as their major 
duty. 2. From the time of the police reserve force, police 
officers have continued to keep important decisionmaking 
authority on defense administration, hence contributing to 
interpreting the defense law system in the context of the police 
law. 3. There has been a strong political tendency to restrain 
SDF activities because there have been powerful political 
parties that insisted on the SDF's unconstitutionality and the 
repenting of the military's wartime acts. 
  In Cold War days, Japan could pass as a "special nation" 
with 
a queer legal interpretation that can only apply to Japan. In 
post- Cold War international society, however, Japan may well 
lose its international trust and endanger its national security 
if it continues to act from the past force of habit. It is 
haughty of legislators to think they can control and regulate by 
law in advance all SDF acts in a complicated international 
society. Constitutional amendments may be needed, but most of 
the hurdles blocking the SDF's activities in international 
society and problems pertaining to international contributions 
can be solved by interpreting the relation between international 
and domestic laws based on international common sense and legal 
principles even before constitutional amendments are considered.

  [Text] In answering questions posed by Mr. Shun Oide of 
the opposition Socialist Democratic Party of Japan during the 23 
May session of the House of Representative Budget Committee, 
Naoaki Murata, director of the Bureau of Defense Policy at the 
Defense Agency, disclosed that the Air Self-Defense Force [ASDF] 
has been studying the "ASDF Action Program, Part 11" to prepare 
Japan for a state of emergency. 
  During the session, Mr. Oide asked the Defense Agency 
official to present the Diet with materials on the ASDF Action 
Program, Part 11. In response, Mr. Murata said: "The ASDF has 
not been working on the study on the premise of amending the 
Self-Defense Forces Law, and I would like to refrain from 
presenting to the Diet any materials which reveal military 
operations." Mr. Oide refused to relent and demanded that the 
question be discussed at the council meeting of the Budget 
Committee. 
  According to a Defense Agency official, the three services 
of 
the Self-Defense Forces have been working on studying military 
operations in anticipation of various emergency situations, but 
the substance of their study has not been made public.

  [Text] Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata commented on the issue 
of Japan's acquiring reconnaissance satellites at the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee on 26 May. He said, "It is 
time to consider how far this can be done for information 
gathering, and to think of what to do," in response to a 
question from Wataru Hiraizumi (Liberal Democratic Party). This 
remark of the prime minister, which indicated he does not 
discount such a possibility, is bound to trigger a debate in 
relation to an existing Diet resolution on the "peaceful use of 
outer space." 
  Hiraizumi interpellated Hata on security issues in relation 
with the situation on the Korean peninsula. He asked if Japan 
should acquire reconnaissance satellites to strengthen its 
capability to gather and analyze information. Hata responded, 
"It is important to possess accurate information to ensure 
security. However, satellites have to do with flying over other 
countries' territories, which is a controversial question. That 
is why there has been little progress." This indicated that the 
issue is indeed being examined. 
  At present, for analytical purposes, Japan purchases from 
the 
United States photographs taken by meteorological satellites. 
However, such photographs have much lower definition than 
photographs from reconnaissance satellites. For this reason, 
officials of the Defense Agency have been asking for Japan's own 
reconnaissance satellites. 
  However, the Foreign Ministry is concerned about the impact 
of this on neighboring countries. The United States is also 
asking Japan to participate in the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) 
program. Some ministry officials are of the opinion that owning 
such satellites "is not good for Japan-U.S. economic relations." 
  In May 1969, the Diet adopted a resolution stipulating that 
"objects launched into outer space, and rockets use for 
launching should be used only for peaceful purposes."

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric is strengthening its local U.S. 
microcomputer ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) 
design function. It is increasing to over 50 people design 
personnel for its sales subsidiary, which has the greatest 
opportunities to hold business talks with clients, a 25-percent 
increase, centering on fiscal 1994, and will create a system 
that will quickly reflect the demands of the client in the 
design. Since design personnel previously were assigned to the 
production subsidiary, the client's needs were not fully 
incorporated in the product design. In the United States, the 
largest overseas consumer market, strengthening of user 
accommodation capability is judged to be linked to an increase 
in competitive power, and they are laying out a new lineup. 
  It is the sales subsidiary, Mitsubishi Electronics America 
(MELA, California) which is increasing design personnel. Until 
now, one Japanese and 39 Americans formed the design unit, but 
this will increase during fiscal 1994 to five Japanese and 45 
Americans, making the design function of the sales subsidiary 
substantial. The company was established in 1973, but until now 
only a few personnel were concerned with design. 
  Moreover, beginning this year, in order to supplement the 
design function of MELA, the production subsidiary, Mitsubishi 
Semiconductor America (MSAI, North Carolina), will make 
full-scale "design-in" activities where the product 
specifications and performance are decided one by one with the 
client. By strengthening the design function at local bases of 
both sales and production, they can promote the creation of 
products that reflect client needs. 
  Mitsubishi is beginning to disperse to various countries the 
design function which previously had been rather concentrated 
within Japan, such as the placing of design personnel in a 
German subsidiary beginning this fiscal year. The strengthening 
of the design function in the United States also can be called a 
link in this. 
  Japanese semiconductor manufacturers are altering their 
constitution which had depended excessively on memory and are 
aiming for repletion in non-memory fields such as ASIC and 
microcomputers in order to recover their international 
competitive power which has rather declined. However, how much 
the products incorporate the demands of the client holds the key 
that will decide competitive power. For that reason, making a 
substantial design function in consumer areas has become a big 
task.

  [Text] Six blast furnace companies such as Nippon Steel 
will make a demand to China for a big boost in prices in joint 
business talks on steel exports to China in the second half of 
1994 (August to January 1995). The price hike will be the first 
in three years, and the range of the hike is about 10 percent. 
Previously, a "special price" has been applied to China that was 
10 to 20 percent below the price for other Asian countries, but 
they are taking advantage of the sudden increase in the demand 
for steel in Asia to review this. If there is a permeation of 
price hikes for China, which accounts for about 30 percent of 
total steel export volume, it appears that it will be linked to 
an improvement in earnings for blast furnaces manufacturers. 
  The joint business talks with China are negotiations every 
half year with the Five Metal and Mineral Production General 
Corporation of China on the prices of eight items such as 
various kinds of steel plate, and this time they will be held in 
Beijing beginning on 16 May. It appears that exports to China 
due to the joint business talks will reach 1.7 million tons in 
the first half of this year, but it is said that they "would 
like to implement a price hike of at least 10 percent in the 
second half even if it somewhat stifles volume" (blast furnace 
maker officer). 
  The various blast furnace companies charge the various 
Southeast Asian nations about $370 per ton for hot-rolled coil, 
but 20 percent less than this for China. The various blast 
furnace companies, who estimate an across-the-board deficit in 
the March 1994 settlement of accounts, aim to eliminate this 
price difference in these negotiations. 
  China appears to be opposed to the price hike in steel, a 
basic material, but the various blast furnace companies view 
that "a price hike environment is determined by the aspect of 
supply and demand" insofar as the surplus export strength of 
South Korea and others, who previously had put effort into 
exports to China, is dropping.

  [Text] NEC will boost the sales amount of semiconductors 
for fiscal 1994 in Southeast Asia to 110 billion yen, a 22 
percent increase over the previous year. It is to deal 
aggressively with rapidly increasing demand due to the 
production shift by home electronics manufacturers and others, 
and in addition to expanding the production volume of their 
Singapore and Malaysian subsidiaries, they will also increase 
exports from Japan. With the high yen in the background, 
semiconductor costs are ballooning in the Southeast Asian 
market, but it seems that domestic manufacturers are 
intensifying a battle for market share, with the same area as 
the stage, due to the largest manufacturer NEC working out 
measures to strengthen sales. 
  Along with this sales plan, the company will boost monthly 
production in Singapore for 4-megabyte DRAM [dynamic 
random-access memory] (dynamic read and write memory necessary 
for memory storage operations) and microcomputer ASIC 
(application-specific integrated circuits) from 78 million in 
the previous fiscal year to 80 million units. 
  Moreover, they also will expand monthly production for 
transistors that are being produced in Malaysia from 2.52 
billion in the previous fiscal year to 2.82 billion units in 
fiscal year 1994. In either case, they anticipate use for 
equipment for the general public produced by home electronics 
manufacturers, etc., in Southeast Asia. However, they will 
handle it by improving the yield rate at both plants, and the 
policy is not to carry out new facilities investment. 
  NEC is undertaking provision of a semiconductor business 
system in Southeast Asia such as establishment of a sales 
company in Singapore.

  [Excerpt] The Indonesian Government has asked the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry [MITI) to extend financial 
assistance to Asahan [name as published] Aluminum, a state-run 
aluminum smelting company in which Japanese firms have a stake. 
The financial assistance being sought by the Indonesian 
Government is that: 1) Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation 
Fund and Japanese firms that invest in Asahan Aluminum subscribe 
for about 10 billion worth of shares in a fresh capital increase 
to be made by Asahan Aluminum; and 2) the current interest rate 
on approximately 190 billion yen in loans extended by the Export 
and Import Bank of Japan be lowered. Asahan Aluminum has come 
into being as the sole overseas aluminum production base for 
Japanese firms that have withdrawn from their overseas aluminum 
smelting business, and the Japanese firms have staked their 
survival on the aluminum smelting industry in Indonesia. 
Nonetheless, Asahan Aluminum has continued to register a poor 
performance because of sluggish aluminum markets around the 
world. MITI plans to accept in principle the Indonesian 
Government's request for the financial assistance after 
concluding that Japan needs to secure an overseas source of 
aluminum ingots to prepare itself for potential fluctuations of 
the world aluminum market. MITI will discuss specific ways to 
provide the financial assistance with 12 Japanese firms, 
including the Sumimoto Chemical Company and the Nippon Light 
Metal Company, which have invested in Asahan Aluminum, and the 
Finance Ministry and the Export and Import Bank of Japan.

  [Text] With a high yen taking root such that in a little 
while it soon will fall below $1 to 100 yen, listed firms in 
Kansai are making an overseas shift in production and overseas 
procurement of parts and materials full-scale. Their aim is to 
bolster earnings taking advantage of areas nearby in the Asian 
economic bloc that are developing. It seems that such moves are 
inviting a deindustrialization of the Kansai economy where there 
are many subcontractor firms and accelerating a change of the 
industrial structure. 
  "It seems that quality is not a problem." Director 
Tsunemichi 
Imanishi of Hamada Printing Machinery heaved a sigh of relief 
while inspecting Chinese castings for a rotary press which 
arrived at their Ueno plant (Mie Prefecture). Because of the 
sales slump in printing machinery, the March 1994 quarter became 
the second consecutive quarter with an ordinary deficit, and 
they were driven to solicit voluntary retirement. Therefore, 
they have decided to reduce by 30 percent variable expenses 
(expenses that increase or decrease along with sales) centering 
on raw material expenses. 
  In the case of this company, the percentage for castings in 
raw material expenses is high, accounting for 8 percent of 
variable expenses. It has taken exactly one year to begin 
importing from China since establishing their plan in the spring 
of 1993 when a high yen was rapidly advancing. It took time to 
develop suppliers and realization was greatly delayed, but 
"costs have been reduced 20 percent over domestic procurement" 
(Imanishi). 
  Domestic sales of sheet printers increased during the time 
of 
the high yen situation in 1985, and they covered the blow from 
the high yen. This time, however, domestic demand has cooled, 
and the price of printing machines has dropped 40 percent from 
the peak. They will not catch up by previous rationalization 
methods. In the future, they plan to procure parts other than 
castings from Europe, etc. 
  Daikin Industries plans to boost the overseas procurement 
ratio in raw materials expenses which account for half of the 
sales cost from the current 5 percent to a goal of 10 percent in 
one to two years and additionally, to 20 percent in the future. 
Domestic sales of air conditioners have fallen, and the March 
1994 quarter turned to a ordinary deficit for the first time in 
17 years. "If we do not undertake countermeasures for the high 
yen which has become rather entrenched, we cannot expect an 
improvement in earnings" (Shiro Tsukasa, manager, General Air 
Conditioner Purchasing Department). 
  They already established a project team specializing in 
overseas procurement in 1985, and are importing copper tubing 
and aluminum sheets, etc., from Europe. In the future, they will 
make procurement parts those with a higher degree of processing. 
Beginning in May, they are scheduled to switch to procurement 
from Indonesia for some of the fan motors, which are the heart 
of room air conditioners. They foresee "at least a 20-percent 
decrease in costs." 
  Matsushita Electric Works will more than double overseas 
procurement from the previous quarter in the November 1994 
quarter to 60 billion yen. The overseas procurement ratio for 
raw materials and products accounts for 13 percent of the 
purchase amount, and has been upped about 7 points. There is a 
policy to increase the import of highly processed products such 
as wood panels for system kitchens, and they say that "a cost 
reduction of about 12 billion yen can be expected." The ordinary 
profit for this quarter has increased 16 percent from the 
previous quarter and is estimated to be 41 billion yen. 
  Director Shigetaka Ito emphasizes that "it is inevitably a 
period when you divide what is necessary to make domestically 
and what should be made abroad." In the future, they will make 
increases centering on the lighting and building products and 
materials divisions which are behind in undertaking overseas 
procurement among the eight divisions, and plan to increase the 
ratio occupied in the purchase amount to 25 percent in 2001. 
  Up until now, the Japanese manufacturing industry has been 
supported by domestic subcontractor firms that handle with great 
care the standards and specifications of the orderer. However, 
"decreases in costs will not proceed if we adhere to the 
previous method of doing things" (Tsukasa). It is necessary to 
turn to concepts such as overseas procurement of parts that are 
low in cost even if somewhat off-standard, and to compensate by 
changes in assembly methods. 
  The move to overseas procurement is not just for raw 
materials and parts, but is spreading to highly processed 
products including finished goods. The deindustrialization of 
industry is gradually proceeding along with this. The officer of 
one machinery manufacturer discloses, "We want to proceed with 
overseas procurement, but have not embarked upon it out of 
consideration for the situation of those we do business with at 
home." 
  The percentage of medium to small businesses in Kansai is 
close to seven points higher than the national average at 59.1 
percent (Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
investigation, 1991) based on volume of manufacturing industry 
shipments, and the effect is great insofar as it is "a 
subcontractor-concentrated area." The structural high yen is 
changing radically the creation of things by firms who have been 
supported by subcontractor manufacturers. Director Yoshimitsu 
Arakawa of the Daiwa Bank Research Institute says, "If we look 
back 10 years from now, we will probably think that this high 
yen was the demarcation point for a change in the economic 
structure" (Atsushi Tamura, Securities Department).

<F P=106> [By Akihiko Tanaka] </F>
  [Text] Since a comparative exhibit has been made of the 
disassembled parts from a Chrysler Neon and our company's parts, 
let's cooperate in searching for items to be the target of VA 
(value analysis)." A Japanese auto maker sent this invitation to 
the parts manufacturers with whom they did business during the 
middle of April. 
  At the exhibit, the parts of the Neon, which surprised the 
industry by their low price, were displayed divided into two 
sections, drive related and body related. The parts of the 
sponsoring manufacturer's car also were displayed, and the plan 
was to compare the differences in design of the two cars. 
  The parts of the Neon in front of their eyes gave a fresh 
shock to the various parts companies of Japan. The president of 
one parts manufacturer raised a voice of admiration, "This truly 
is reengineering and it is hard to believe that the workmanship 
is U.S. made." 
  For example, there is the muffler joint. It is a one-touch 
slip-on type. The Japanese-made joint requires four bolts, but 
bolts are unnecessary with this method. The attachment of the 
gasoline tank is simple and it is said that "places that use 
several parts in the Japanese-made section are held to a few. If 
the bumper could be made a unit to this extent, it would reduce 
the number of parts." 
  Of course, if analyzed from the professional standpoint that 
"the underside of the car is rusted" or "there are gaps around 
the various instruments," the defects also are conspicuous. 
However, insofar as Chrysler says "we made it with the intention 
of competing with Japanese carmakers," the Japanese frankly 
admit "there are many things to study." 
  Efforts are under way to thoroughly investigate parts costs, 
and the various Japanese companies now say in unison that 
"design capability determines 70 percent of manufacturing 
costs." The sluggish demand has been prolonged and in addition 
to rationalization, the greatest task for the various companies 
is "a fundamental review of design." Making use of "the cheap 
dollar" in "design capability" which Neon symbolizes, the major 
U.S. parts manufacturers are storming "the Japanese car market." 
Cherry Corporation (Illinois; president, Grant Hollett), a major 
auto switch company, established a Japanese branch in Yokohama 
at the end of last year, and is pushing uniquely designed 
switches to Japanese firms. 
  "Japanese carmakers will not touch them with the cost 
superiority of a few percent for U.S. products. They will use 
them for the first time when there is more of a difference 
adding transport, evaluation, and design costs. Cost superiority 
of some tens of percent will be necessary for that." The 
eloquence of branch president Hoshino is backed by 
self-confidence. 
  U.S. Cherry products are considered modules with the switch 
base parts standardized, and a metal part called a "twist lock" 
of the module runs electricity to the switch knob. It is a 
unique mechanism of the company, soldering is not required, and 
it can be connected with one touch. The module can be adapted to 
any switch, and mass production of 1 million a month will be 
possible. 
  The part that meets the needs of the individual client is 
just the knob which corresponds to the switch contact part, and 
it just has to be redesigned and again produced. According to 
branch president Hoshino, Japanese parts manufacturers use some 
common parts, but basically, the whole switch is designed for 
the individual client. The more types of cars, the more they are 
compelled to have many part types and small quantity production, 
and it becomes a factor in increasing costs. 
  ITT Automotive (Michigan; president, Timothy Luriette), a 
major U.S. parts manufacturer, points out that "So long as the 
Japanese car maker's own company specs are satisfied, the 
position of the supplier with cost superiority becomes clear" 
(Tomokazu Ataka, manager, business development department, 
Japanese office of the company). 
  Department manager Ataka discloses that "If procurement is 
made within Japan, parts which are $200 each end up $80 each 
when made by ITT." 
  This is the price when supplied in the United States, but 
even if upgraded and exported to Japan, it can be supplied to 
the Japanese market at $120. That calculates to 40 percent 
cheaper than the Japanese-made part. 
  What is the strategy to counter U.S.-made parts which are 
expanding with unique "design capability"? President Akio Ono of 
Car Sonic hastens to instruct employees, "Let's design so that 
they can be employed in light cars also." They only have some 
dealings with Fuji Heavy Industry for light cars for the 
aluminum radiators which are the forte of the company. President 
Ono says, "Just being used in light cars will hold down price 
and since we must handle it by conserving space, a change from 
previous concepts is unavoidable." In the 1980's, U.S. carmakers 
and parts manufacturers vied with each other in studying 
Japanese cars and absorbing manufacturing know-how. Japanese 
manufacturers one and all now are studying the "design 
capability" of U.S. makers.

  [Text] Details of a draft report on how the optical fiber 
network ought to be developed to build a multimedia society, 
which has been worked out by the Telecommunications Council 
(chaired by Fumio Watanabe, adviser to Tokyo Marine and Fire 
Insurance Co., Ltd.), an advisory panel to the post and 
telecommunications minister, were revealed on 3 May. With 
regard to the focal point of allotting roles between "the 
government" and "the private sector," the draft report specifies 
the need for the private sector to play a leading role in 
developing the network, saying "it is desirable to make utmost 
use of vital power of the private sector." According to the 
draft report, the optical fiber network is scheduled to be 
completed in 2010. The draft report urges the government to 
revise related laws and to establish an assistance and loan 
system to promote the use of the optical fiber network for such 
services as remote medical care and education at home by 2010. 
The council plans to submit a final report to the post and 
telecommunications minister on 31 May after working out final 
details. 
  The United States is an advanced nation in building the 
optical fiber network, in which a large amount of demand for 
related services is expected following the spread of multimedia 
and software equipment. With Vice President Gore playing a 
leading role, the country is promoting the national information 
infrastructure (NII) project designed to make various use of the 
optical fiber network. In Japan as well, there is now a growing 
demand for coming up with policies that will serve as a 
"guideline" for establishing the optical fiber network. For 
example, people in the government, the industrial circle, and 
the medical and education fields have shown strong interest in 
development of the network. 
  The draft report is comprised of seven chapters. In the 
first chapter, "The Need To Improve the Information 
Communications Infrastructure," the draft report makes it a 
condition for developing the optical fiber network that 
"everyone everywhere in Japan is able to enjoy life at the same 
level as in the most convenient place in the world, to get a 
job, and to touch culture." 
  Moreover, in analyzing the "new media" project that drew 
attention in the eighties, the draft report states that the 
project failed because measures to use new media were 
insufficient in creating new demands. In the seventh chapter, 
it cites laws that have to be reviewed to materialize the 
following services that are now regulated by laws: remote 
diagnosis and medical treatment; education at home; working at 
home with telecommunications; an inquiry of a witness and a 
meeting of a board of directors through a teleconference system; 
home shopping for medicine, rice, and real estate. 
  With regard to the scale of domestic markets concerned, it 
predicts that business in the multimedia market as a whole will 
amount to approximately 123 trillion yen in 2010. Of this 
amount, the optical fiber network business is expected to reach 
about 56 trillion yen. 
  In the sixth chapter, the draft report clearly says the 
private sector should take the initiative in developing the 
network. It also points out that the government's role is "to 
promote necessary deregulation, to encourage highly motivated 
companies' access to the business, and to emphasize improvement 
of conditions based on the current move toward a fusion of 
communications and broadcasting." Moreover, since the 
development of the optical fiber network costs approximately 1 
trillion yen every year, the draft report proposes setting up an 
interest-free loan system designed to assist communications 
enterprises such as NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation]. 
  It also urges the "government" to help the private sector 
develop new ways of using the optical fiber network, to bring 
about the on- line system for dealing with services at the 
window and public relations bulletins, and to reduce exchanges 
of notes between organizations. 
  Noting the schedule for developing the optical fiber network 
in the fourth chapter, the draft report indicates a plan to 
finish installing fiber-optic lines to cover households 
nationwide in 2010 when Japan's population is expected to reach 
a peak. It proposes the three-step procedure for installing 
fiber-optic lines: the first step is to install fiber-optic 
lines in areas of cities where prefectural offices are located, 
by 2000; and the second step is to install the lines in all 
areas of cities with a population of over 100,000 by 2005. It 
also indicates that it is necessary to install fiber-optic lines 
in public organizations, including schools, libraries, and 
hospitals, by 2000, in an effort to have them play a leading 
role in promoting the optical fiber network.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] and the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy [ANRE] 
decided to abolish on-the-spot safety inspections at power 
generating stations, except for nuclear power plants. In 
principle, MITI and ANRE plan to abolish the safety inspections 
in five years by gradually shifting the power plant inspections 
to private companies' voluntary inspections after revising the 
Electricity Enterprises Act [EEA] by the end of 1995. MITI will 
also study the possibility of abolishing its auxiliary organ, 
which carries out the safety inspections as MITI's 
subcontractor. This is in response to a request made by power 
companies, which following implementation of the plan, will be 
able to save over 10 billion yen. It seems that the plan will 
also be linked to lowering the power rate, which is higher than 
in European countries. 
  Regarding power companies and household power generation, 
the 
government enacted safety standard on the basis of the EEA. 
Currently, engineers of MITI and its auxiliary organ, the Power 
Generating Facility and Technological Inspection Association, 
make regular one-the-spot safety inspections at power generating 
stations, either operating or under construction, once a year. 
They inspect boilers, turbines, and other facilities and there 
are more than 100 items subject to inspection. 
  The number of items has been increasing since the EEA was 
enacted in 1911. 
  According to a plan MITI explained to electric companies on 
11 May, the government plans to: 1) gradually abolish, except 
for nuclear power plants, the on-the-spot inspections, which are 
being conducted at all power generating stations, by allowing 
instead private companies to carry out voluntary inspections; 2) 
reduce frequency of inspections and the number of inspected 
items; and 3) ease the system in which private companies are 
required to have government approval for power plant 
construction plans, and to convert it to a notification system. 
Except for nuclear power plants, MITI will gradually abolish 
on-the-spot inspections in five years. 
  Nine electric power companies are paying the government and 
its auxiliary organ 4-5 billion yen a year as fees for the 
inspections and state examinations. 
  The power companies, if the plan is implemented, will not 
have to shut down their power plants for the inspections. 
Therefore, their plant operation efficiency will improve. 
Ultimately, "the power industry as a whole will be able to 
reduce operation costs by more than 10 billion yen," (according 
to a senior executive of an electric power company). 
  MITI started in March discussing the possibility of easing 
government regulations on electric power at meetings of the 
Council of Electric Power Companies [Denki Jigyo Shingikai] (an 
advisory organ to MITI). The same agency plans to incorporate 
measures designed to gradual abolish the inspections into a 
proposal that will be mapped out in late June. MITI will submit 
a bill for revision of the EEA to an ordinary Diet session in 
1995 at the earliest.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has prepared a "program for a new information system" 
containing the Japanese Government's strategy for introducing a 
new information system to the public sector. The program aims 
at linking Japan's system with the national information 
infrastructure (NII), concept of which is taking roots in the 
United States with the multimedia age nearing. 
  Five areas including education and research have been 
chosen, 
and they will be enabled to tie in directly with the U.S. 
information infrastructure, by improving on the computer-run 
information and communications networks. For instance, the 
program will improve electronic libraries so that people would 
be able to search for library materials using their personal 
computers, provide information network systems to research 
institutes, and turn administrative materials into database 
systems. The government's overall views on the program will be 
consolidated by the middle of July. MITI then intends to work 
on the Finance Ministry to make the program a major part of the 
public works projects in the next year's budget. The project is 
also expected to encourage investment from private industry. 
  MITI plans to call a meeting of the Industrial Structure 
Council (an advisory panel to the MITI minister) on 19 May, and 
will report on the concept of the "program for a new information 
system" that can be called Japan's version of the NII. This is 
the first time that a program for the public sector's 
information system will be formulated. 
  Last September, the U.S. Government announced the NII 
concept, which was a revised version of Vice President Gore's 
"concept for a super highway" -- with the revision made to make 
the private sector lead the project. MITI's concept follows the 
U.S. Government's way of thinking. The government, as the major 
user, will push for a buildup of the information system, and 
this will hopefully contribute to the recovery of the 
recession-bound market. 
  The five public-sector areas chosen for the new information 
system program are -- in addition to education and research 
organizations -- medical care and welfare, general 
administration, and libraries. In the area of education, 100 
elementary and middle schools will be connected in personal 
computer networks, and projects to conduct classes with overseas 
schools will begin. Experiments with the new concept might begin 
even before the end of this year by using funds from the 1993 
supplementary budget.

  [Text] Seven companies of the Toyota Group such as Toyoda 
Automatic Loom Works announced the March 1994 settlement of 
accounts on 12 May. The seven companies had a decrease in income 
and decrease in profits across the board, but with thorough cost 
reduction, they have begun to produce rationalization results on 
the highest level of the past and except for Toyoda Machine 
Works which has a high percentage of machine tools, secured a 
profit. This term, however, with the prolonged slump in the auto 
market and parts purchase pressure from overseas, the various 
companies of the group are being pressed for further 
rationalization. Compared to other groups such as Nissan Motor, 
Toyota has a little more experience in rationalization, but 
competition upon which their survival hangs is beginning within 
an operating environment that is nothing but grim. 
  The effect of rationalization especially contributed to the 
increase in profit factor in the March 1994 settlement of 
accounts. With the 9 billion yen of Aisin Seiki heading the 
list, the 8 billion yen of Toyoda Automatic Loom Works and the 
6.8 billion yen of Toyota Body stand out. All have recorded the 
highest level of the past. The ordinary profits for the three 
companies were respectively 10.5 billion yen, 14.5 billion yen, 
and 3.5 billion yen, but without the rationalization effects, 
they would have fallen to a deficit or just barely a profit. The 
other four companies also produced the highest rationalization 
effects of the past. 
  At Aisin, which tweaked out 9 billion yen, the company-wide 
cost reduction actions which began in November 1991 have reached 
their peak. They have reviewed the quality and cost of their own 
company's products such as clutches and brakes, and developed 
production method assistance actions for suppliers and 
thoroughly developed activities with globalization, etc. as the 
pillar seeking markets. As a result, they have realized 2.5 
billion yen by successive decreases in production processes, 2.4 
billion yen by purchasing and other reforms, and 2.2 billion yen 
by cost reductions. 
  Toyota Body, which invested close to 50 billion yen in 
Inabe-cho, Mie Prefecture, and completed the Inabe plant in 
December 1993, made a thorough review of production processes in 
the plant construction. Except for the buildings, prospects are 
that they can cover the majority of the depreciation costs by 
rationalization. In 1995 when the new plant is in full 
operation, a rationalization effect of 1.2 billion yen will be 
produced. 
  Not just the Toyota group, but the various parts and 
assembly 
companies affiliated with automakers such as Nissan and Mazda 
have been earnest in cost reduction actions. There is no big 
difference in the target levels for cost reduction, but as 
opposed to voices heard from groups other than Toyota which say, 
"It is fine if we attain half the target value ordered by the 
parent company," they are desperate at the Toyota group, saying, 
"If we do not decrease costs more than the level requested by 
Toyota, no profit of our own will be produced." In addition to 
Toyota itself giving detailed guidance to the various companies 
of the group on rationalization measures, there has been an 
atmosphere of fear within the group of being dropped and they 
have been thorough to the extent of "not providing tea during 
conferences and even using the back of paper." This 
consciousness is generating the large amount of the 
rationalization effect for the Toyota group. 
  Toyota is further demanding that the various companies in 
the 
group reduce costs 15 percent in a three-year period starting in 
1994. For this reason, the various companies will continue to 
proceed with rationalization such as a review of production 
processes and product development even in the March 1995 
quarter. The amounts are estimated to be less than the previous 
term across the board, such as 8.5 billion yen for Aisin and 5.3 
billion yen for Toyoda Automatic Loom Works. That is because 
"there are few new products this year incorporating 
rationalization effects from the development and design stage" 
(Toyoda Automatic Loom Works), and the effect of cost-reduction 
actions within existing product groups is gradually lessening. 
  Moreover, even with rationalization, once there is a high 
yen, an exchange loss is generated due to the high yen, such as 
the 6.5 billion yen in the March 1994 quarter for Toyoda 
Automatic Loom Works, and the surrounding environment is grim 
such that a rationalization effect is canceled. 
  Cheap import passenger cars have appeared, and imports of 
parts by automakers will increase further in the future. While 
prices are dropping and quantities are decreasing, auto parts 
manufacturers are plunging into an era when it is too much to 
handle by rationalization alone.

  [Text] The ministries and agencies in Kasumigaseki that 
oversee the country's economic activities have begun to examine 
their personnel structure in preparation for the coming 
reassignment of senior officials which will take place in June. 
In the midst of the mounting and pressing issues such as 
taxation system reform, repair of the U.S.-Japan economic 
relationship, and restoration of better business, the emphasis 
of this reshuffle is how it can compensate for the uncertainty 
associated with the Hata administration's minority government. 
Moreover, in light of the strong American criticism against the 
Japanese bureaucracy that charges that the "bureaucrats manage 
Japan," personnel affairs this time are receiving international 
attention as well. (The year the official discussed joined the 
ministry is indicated in parentheses). 
<H5>  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] </H5>
  The prospect is becoming stronger that Administrative Vice 
Minister Hideaki Kumano (1960) is to remain in his position. 
  In connection with the issue of the de facto dismissal of 
Masahisa Naito, former Industrial Policy Bureau director, by 
former MITI Minister Hiroshi Kumagai, many former ministry 
officials hold the opinion that the "vice minister should be 
replaced and there should be a clear cut departure from the past 
with new people and a new spirit." 
  But the expectation is strong in the administration that the 
combination of Finance Vice Minister Jiro Saito and Vice 
Minister Kumano should steer through the pending issues. Also 
within the ministry, the mood is gaining strength that they 
should bring the system under control with him [Kumano] 
remaining in place. If the vice minister stays on, it is 
expected that Sozaburo Okamatsu (1960), MITI deputy vice 
minister; Yoshihiro Sakamoto (1962), International Trade Policy 
Bureau director; and others will stay on in their respective 
positions. It is likely that Wataru Aso (1963), Patent Office 
director general, and Hideki Osada (1963), Small and Medium 
Enterprise Agency director general, will retire. 
<H5>  Finance Ministry </H5>
  The continuation in office of Administrative Vice Minister 
Saito (1959) is certain. Budget Bureau Director Kyosuke 
Shinozawa (1960), Tax Bureau Director Tadasu Ogawa (1962), and 
Secretariat Director Takeshi Komura (1963) are also expected to 
stay on and to try to realize tax system reform. And the 
"international pair," Yukinori Nakahira (1963), deputy vice 
minister for financial affairs, and Takatoshi Kato (1964), 
International Finance Bureau director, are also highly likely to 
remain in office. Eisuke Hamamoto (1961), National Tax 
Administration Agency director general, will retire; and the 
unofficial designation has been made for Nobuyuki Teramura 
(1961), Banking Bureau director, to succeed him. Yoshimasa 
Nishimura (1963), Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy 
director, is the leading candidate for the position of Banking 
Bureau director. Sohei Hidaka (1963), Securities Bureau 
director, is expected to retire; and Koji Tanami (1964), deputy 
vice minister of Policy Coordination, among others, is rumored 
to succeed him. 
<H5>  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries </H5>
  Deputy Vice Minister Jiro Shiwaku (1959), who had postponed 
his retirement, which was quite an unusual case, has now retired 
with the April signing of the new multilateral trade negotiation 
(Uruguay Round) marking his departure from the stage, and other 
senior officials' personnel affairs have nearly been resolved. 
The focal points have been the personnel assignments for 
directors of the Forestry and Fisheries Agencies. The names of 
Hajime Irisawa (1963), Agricultural Structure Improvement Bureau 
director, and Michio Shimada (1964), Statistics and Information 
Department director, are mentioned. 
<H5>  Construction Ministry </H5>
  The focal point is the resignation or remaining in office of 
Shigeo Mochizuki (1959), administrative vice minister. If he 
retires, Haruyoshi Fujii (1962), vice minister of engineering 
affairs, will be promoted; and for the new vice minister of 
engineering, Takashi Toyoda (1962), River Bureau director, is 
the leading candidate. If the Administrative vice minister 
remains in place, then Engineering Affairs Vice Minister Fujii 
is expected to remain in his current post . 
<H5>  Transportation Ministry </H5>
  The continuation of Michio Matsuo (1960), administrative 
vice 
minister is certain; the focal point is the successor for Tsuguo 
Iyama (1961), Maritime Safety Agency director general, whose 
retirement is expected. The names of Railway Bureau Director Yu 
Hatano (1963) and Civil Aviation Bureau Director Yasutoshi 
Tsuchisaka (1963) are mentioned, but there is a good possibility 
that Mr. Tsuchisaka will remain in his post because the 
discussion on Narita Airport expansion is approaching its final 
stages. 
<H5>  Post and Telecommunications Ministry </H5>
  The retirement of Administrative Vice Minister Futoshi 
Shirai 
(1959) and the promotion of Telecommunications Bureau Director 
Haruki Matsuno (1960) to fill the position have become certain. 
The leading candidate to become Telecommunications Bureau 
director is Communications Policy Bureau Director Mitsuo 
Igarashi (1963) and to become Communications Policy Bureau 
director is Councilor Koji Tani (1964). 
<H5>  Economic Planning Agency </H5>
  A partial reshuffle of senior officials was made in January, 
so the regular reassignments in the summer will be kept small. 
Administrative Vice Minister Tsutomu Tanaka is likely to remain 
in post. In that case, Coordination Bureau Director Atsushi 
Kobayashi (1961), the leading candidate to be the next 
Administrative vice minister, and most other main senior 
officials are expected to stay on in their present posts. 
  The characteristic of this year's personnel moves in the 
ministries and agencies overseeing national economic affairs is 
the prospect that the current administrative vice ministers in 
the major ministries, such as the Finance Ministry, will remain 
in their posts. In the background, the bureaucrats' strong 
self-conceit is seen, to the effect that the Hata Cabinet's 
government foundation is weak, so the bureaucracy has to take 
the lead in management of important issues. Both in Japan and 
overseas, critical voices against the bureaucrats are getting 
stronger, claiming that the existence of the bureaucrats weakens 
the government's ability to determine policy. But the 
stagnation of personnel affairs, symbolized by the current 
[administrative] vice ministers remaining in office, contains 
the possibility that it will lead to a strengthened voice for 
the bureaucrats. 
  This time around the only economic-related ministry in which 
the prospect of the [administrative] vice minister's retirement 
is certain is the Post and Telecommunications Ministry. All of 
the ministries and agencies are trying to strengthen the 
structure by retaining the status quo for personnel. The reason 
the bureaucracy offers for the retention of the current vice 
ministers is that the pressing issues can only be steered 
forward under a strong line-up. 
  By last June, the Finance Ministry had already lined-up the 
people for reform of the taxation system with Vice Minister 
Saito at the center. And this year's decision for the vice 
minister to remain in office can be said to be a "done-deal." 
Early this year, Vice Minister Saito was the target of 
criticism against bureaucrats when he displayed strong-arm 
tactics with the national welfare tax concept. But he will try 
to achieve reform of the taxation system, while retaining the 
existing policy line and structure. 
  MITI will try to improve the U.S.-Japanese relationship 
through the retention of Vice Minister Kumano and other major 
directors. But there is a danger that the U.S. might become 
suspicious that the Japanese bureaucratic organization has 
become tougher. So this could become a main element among the 
obstacles in the negotiations. 
  The politicians receive the baptism of elections. But the 
bureaucrats' personnel moves lack such a check. This is all the 
more reason that highly transparent personnel moves, which keep 
the people's criticism in mind, should be sought. When 
personnel affairs are stagnant, there is the danger of the 
bureaucrats making their own decisions in the process of 
deciding policy and of criticism against bureaucrats in and out 
of Japan getting stronger.

  [Text] Police yesterday issued arrest warrants for two 
Iranians allegedly involved in a foiled truck-bomb plot believed 
to have been aimed at the Israeli Embassy in March, Bangkok 
Metropolitan Police Chief Pol Lt Gen Chaisit Kanchanakit said. 
However, Chaisit admitted that it was not possible that the men 
were still in Thailand. 
  Mohammadt Lotfollah and Hossein Shahriarifar, both about 40 
years old, have been identified by police in connection with the 
plot. Police said they had asked Interpol to help. 
  "We still don't know where they are living but we are 
certain 
that they left the country through the southern border of 
Thailand," Chaisit said. 
  The plot was unveiled on March 17 when the owner went to 
claim his truck, which had been taken to Lumphini police station 
a week earlier. 
  Police then discovered a one-tonne water tank full of 
powdered ammonium nitrate, large quantities of C-4 plastic 
explosive wired to detonators and four 25-litre containers 
filled with diesel oil in the back of the truck. 
  The body of the man who delivered the truck to the alleged 
saboteurs was found in the water tank. 
  According to police, the truck had been stored at the police 
station since being involved in a minor accident at Phloenchit 
intersection, about 100 metres from the Israeli embassy, on 
March 11.

  [Text] Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak yesterday welcomed a 
statement by a senior United States official that Washington 
would consult Thailand in deciding whether or not to provide 
military assistance to Phnom Penh to fight the Khmer Rouge. 
  "It's good that the US will also consult us," Gen Wichit 
told 
reporters at Government House. 
  He was responding to a statement made by Mr Kent Weidemenn, 
US deputy assistant secretary of defence, during a visit to the 
Thai- Cambodian border last Tuesday to assess the Cambodian 
war's impact on Thailand. 
  Gen Wichit said he did not personally meet with Mr Weidemenn 
and so did not have the chance to exchange views with him. 
However, he was briefed on Thailand's position that military 
assistance to the Cambodian government to fight the Khmer Rouge 
would only perpetuate the war in Cambodia. 
  He also said Mr Weidemenn's visit to the border was useful 
in 
providing first hand information about the impact of the 
fighting inside Cambodia on Thailand. 
  France, Australia and the U.S. are considering a request by 
the Cambodian government to provide military assistance to fight 
the Khmer Rouge.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri 
spoke with newsmen after receiving Samdech Son Sann at the 
Foreign Ministry this morning. He said Samdech Son Sann 
currently holds the post of counselor to King Norodom Sihanouk. 
Son Sann is a senior Cambodian citizen, but now has no 
political involvement in Cambodia. His duty is merely to advise 
King Sihanouk. Prasong said Son Sann was on his way to a 
meeting in Paris and called on him as an old friend. 
  According to the foreign minister, Son Sann said the 
roundtable to be held in Pyongyang tomorrow will be a good way 
for the Cambodian leaders to exchange views. The leaders of 
various Cambodian factions are already in Pyongyang and the 
meeting will be chaired by Samdech Sihanouk. Prasong said Son 
Sann hopes that the meeting will be successful and will result 
in peace in Cambodia. Prasong said Son Sann understands 
Thailand's good wishes to see Cambodian people live in peace. 
  Asked by newsmen about the disappearance of two UN officials 
near the Cambodian border in Sisaket Province, the foreign 
minister said he received a report that the Suranari Force was 
searching for them. However, the missing officials reportedly 
surfaced in Phnom Penh. The Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh has been 
instructed to verify this development.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday 
reaffirmed an invitation for Burma to attend the ministerial 
meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 
regardless of a warning letter from the Karen National Union 
[KNU] president. 
  "I have invited Burma and they have accepted the invitation. 
It's to bring them to the outside world," Sqn Ldr [Squadron 
Leader] Prasong said. 
  KNU president General Saw Bo Mya has asked ASEAN members not 
to invite Burma's military government to attend the Bangkok 
meeting in July. 
  Gen Bo Mya said the Karens would have problems if Burma was 
accepted as a member of ASEAN and the invitation was part of a 
bigger problem. 
  Sqn Ldr Prasong insisted he would not have contacts with the 
Karen leader because the Thai Government would only deal at 
government level. 
  "Gen Bo Mya is the opposite side to the Burmese government. 
We must have contact only with the Government," he said. 
  Gen Bo Mya said he had tried to contact Thai officials but 
they would not meet him. They gave no reason.

  [Text] The Cairns group agreed in its latest meeting in 
Uruguay that the drafting of the United States Farm Bill in 
September should be monitored closely, according to 
secretary-general of the Agricultural Economics Office 
Phithiphong Phungbun na Ayutthaya. 
  He said yesterday that monitoring was necessary because of 
speculation that the US might resort to rice subsidies counter 
to the GATT agreement signed in Marrakech by GATT members 
including the US. 
  The Cairns group has assigned Canada and Australia to 
monitor 
the bill. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak proposed in 
Montevideo Uruguay, on May 19 and 20 that the agricultural 
policy of developed countries including the US, Japan and those 
in the European Union be monitored closely. 
  Developments on this issue must be reported promptly and the 
Cairns Group should ensure that developed countries refrain from 
using health regulations as trade protectionism in disguise, 
according to Thailand. 
  Thailand wants the group to push for trade in fishery 
products to be more liberalised under GATT.

  [Text] The Bank of Thailand may consider squeezing consumer 
credit to control inflation which may shoot beyond the target 
due to a combination of factors, Wichit Suphinit, the central 
bank governor, said yesterday. 
  He added that the Bank of Thailand may have to revise this 
year's projected economic growth and inflation rates due to the 
rise in crude oil prices in May. 
  Due to higher demand as the worldwide economic recovery 
continues and the breakout of a war between north and south 
Yemen, the price of crude has climbed to US$16.30 per barrel, a 
15 per cent rise compared to the start of the year. 
  The higher crude price could lead to higher inflation and 
affect growth as measures are taken to curtail inflation, he 
said. 
  The Bank of Thailand has projected this year's GDP growth at 
8.2 per cent and inflation rate under 4.2 per cent. 
  He said the monetary authorities are considering controlling 
consumer credit to halt inflation. 
  In the first quarter, the credit of banks climbed to a high 
of 22.8 per cent compared to the same period last year and above 
the projected target of 21.7 per cent. 
  Without elaborating, the governor said the central bank did 
not want to see excessive speculation in stocks and land. 
  This is the point which the central bank is focusing on to 
keep inflation within the target, he said. 
  But he added that the curb on credit would not be drastic so 
as not to lead to higher interest rates. The manufacturing 
sector should not shoulder a higher cost of production, he said. 
  The Bank of Thailand is adopting an early stance in view of 
the world economy picking up next year in all categories which 
would spur the Thai economy, already performing well even with 
the previous worldwide economic doldrums. 
  Inflation in the first four months was higher than the 
target 
set by the central bank of 4.7 per cent. Inflation might have 
slowed down from March but was still high and of concern. 
  Banthit Nichathaworn, deputy director of the Research 
Department at the Bank of Thailand, said the only major concern 
was the price of crude. 
  The Omani price in May was up 18 per cent from $12.8 per 
barrel in March to $15. 
  The average in the first five months was $13.7 per barrel 
which is lower than the projection of $14.7 but there are signs 
that the crude price is rising faster. 
  This could lead to higher production costs in the second 
half 
of this year for the Thai economy. 
  The Bank of Thailand is closely monitoring the situation but 
is unclear about what the non-Opec member countries will do.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists on 
May 25 committed photographing and electronic reconnaissance on 
the whole areas of the northern half of Korea by letting a 
Japan-based RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane make 
high-altitude flights above Tokjok island, Yangpyong and 
Yangyang areas of South Korea, according to military sources. 
  That day, an overseas-based E-3 early warning plane flew 
into 
South Korea to command in an allround way flying corps involved 
in a war gamble and committed an aerial espionage on the 
northern half of Korea, and two RV-1 army tactical 
reconnaissance planes also made an aerial espionage on the 
frontline and coast line areas of the North side, flying above 
the area of the military demarcation line. 
  These are premeditated military provocations of the U.S. 
imperialists to carry their northward invasion scheme into 
effect.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
committed long-distance non-stop bombing exercises against the 
North by formations of overseas-based pursuit-assault planes and 
VTOL assault planes in the sky above Yongwol and Pyongchang 
areas of South Korea on May 23 and 24, according to military 
sources. 
  A P-3 anti-submarine plane based in Japan made a low and an 
ultra low flight in the sky above the East and West Seas of 
Korea on May 23. 
  On the 23rd and 24th, scores of armed helicopters and 
transport helicopters of the South Korean puppet army staged 
ground attack supporting and airlifting operation exercises in

<F P=106> ["The U.S. Urged To Choose Package Solution"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) [SKNDF] 
released a letter on May 18 exposing the nuclear clamour of the 
U.S. imperialists and its followers, according to the 
Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation. 
  The letter consists of "1. Escalation of `Nuclear Issue'", " 
2. Fabrication of `Nuclear Suspicion'" and "3. Recipe for 
Solution to Nuclear Issue on the Korean Peninsula." 
  Noting that "the nuclear issue" of the North of Korea is an 
offspring of the premediated and systematic anti-DPRK nuclear 
clamor raised by the United States to stifle the North, the 
letter says such criminal moves have been escalated through the 
stages of the rumor about "nuclear development sign," the rumor 
about "nuclear development" and the rumor about "possession of 
nuclear weapons." 
  The rumor about "nuclear development sign" invented by the 
United States boils down to the allegation that "a large-scale 
research complex surrounded by anti-aircraft guns was found in 
Yongbyon, which is classified as nuclear facilities designed to 
manufacture nuclear bombs," "a 30 mw reactor is in operation, 
which seems to be for military use as there is no power cable 
there," "a newly-built long building is guessed to be 
reprocessing facility" and "the new puddles on the shores of the 
River Kuryong are surmised to be traces of high explosion test." 
  Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, told a press conference in Beijing that the 
nuclear inspection proved the nuclear facilities of the North 
are used for peaceful purpose and that they "have found no 
reliable evidence of nuclear arms development" in the North. 
  Failing to deceive the world people with the rumor about 
"nuclear development sign," the United States summoned IAEA 
inspectors to Washington to frame another plot, the rumor about 
"nuclear arms development." It spread the rumor that it "found 
out that North Korea reprocessed nuclear fuel in [words 
indistinct] and early 1992" and instigated IAEA officials to 
suddenly insist on "inconsistencies in principle" between the 
DPRK's initial report and the result of the IAEA's measurement 
in the quantity of plutonium extracted from fuel rods. 
  With the rumors about "nuclear development sign" and 
"nuclear 
arms development" ineffective, the United States resumed the 
once suspended Team Spirit nuclear war exercises and egged the 
IAEA on to try to force the North to accept "special inspection" 
of its military sites. Then, it began spreading another false 
report that the North "has produced nuclear weapons and hid 
them." In an attempt to justify the false report, the United 
States, availing itself of the name of Russia's KGB and the 
British intelligence agency, alleged that the North 
"manufactured small nuclear bombs and concealed them in a silo." 
  The United States is now trying to justify the rumor about 
"the North's possession of nuclear weapons" spread by itself. 
  The letter says the U.S. and South Korean rulers have left 
no 
stone unturned in their efforts to accuse the North of "nuclear 
arms development." 
  "The nuclear suspicion" against the North was fabricated and 
spread by the U.S. intelligence authorities. It started in July 
1989 when a false information that "the North's nuclear arms 
development facilities were snapped" by a U.S. paper THE 
WASHINGTON POST. In a bid to give objectivity and credibility 
to it, the U.S. intelligence authorities opened to the public in 
September 1989 a photograph allegedly taken by the French 
orbiting observatory spot. 
  Nuclear experts, however, said the picture taken by the 
intelligence satellite lacks clearness for distinguishing the 
shapes, holding that the capability of the satellite was 
exaggerated. 
  Director of the U.S. CIA James Woolsey is now alleging "the 
North not only has enough plutonium for manufacturing a nuclear 
bomb but also will have plutonium enough to produce an A-bomb at 
intervals of four or six weeks by next year when it has a 25 mw 
reactor far bigger than the existing one." 
  Informations concocted by intelligence services are 
reproduced on an enlarged scale by government mouthpieces. 
  As regards the North's "nuclear issue," government 
mouthpieces of South Korea and the West described the 5 mw 
experimental conversion reactor in the North as "a 30 mw 
reactor" (South Korean CHOSON ILBO and HANKUK ILBO), the two 
commercial reactors now under construction as "completed 
reactors for the production of plutonium" (TONG-A ILBO) and the 
radiochemical laboratory under construction as " reprocessing 
facility in operation" (the U.S. ABC and Japanese ASAHI SHIMBUN.) 
<H5>  Distorted Reports Are Added to Exaggerated Reports. </H5>
  When the result of the first nuclear inspection proving that 
the North's nuclear facilities were peaceful ones was published 
at a meeting of the board of governors of the IAEA in June 1992, 
the South Korean ambassador in charge of atomic energy 
cooperation told reporters "the suspicion was proved." Then, 
nearly all the venal papers of South Korea and no small number 
of foreign media flashed the false news that "the North's 
nuclear facilities have been proved to be for the production of 
nuclear weapons and to be reprocessing facilities." 
  THE WASHINGTON POST carried a groundless report that North 
Korea was "moving the reprocessing facilities in Yongbyon with 
trucks," while TONG-A ILBO said North Korea was "operating 
uranium-enriching facilities." 
  Today the Heritage Foundation of the United States, the 
technical information centre of Tokai University of Japan, the 
Defense Development Institute of South Korea and other 
unprincipled institutes and pretended scholars are inventing 
various presumptions to spread "nuclear suspicion," branding all 
the peaceful nuclear facilities of the North as military ones. 
  They are now spreading various rumors -- the graphite 
reactor 
is for the production of nuclear bombs because it can turn out 
more plutonium than other reactors. 
  While circulating such rumors, the U.S. authorities have 
appeared on the stage to make "the North's nuclear issue" a 
serious, pending political issue. 
  The U.S. authorities formed a high-level policy mediation 
team, a permanent organization for consulting and adjusting the 
positions of departments in the administration to deal with "the 
nuclear issue of the North" on the governmental level by closely 
combining diplomacy with military. 
  Meanwhile, the United States uses the South Korean and 
Japanese authorities as its lackeys in politicizing "the nuclear 
issue of the North." It summoned No Tae-u to Washington in July 
and September 1991 and ordered him to deal with "the nuclear 
issue" as a pending issue in inter-Korean relations. The South 
Korea-U.S. summit talks in Seoul in July 1993 and in Washington 
in November 1993 Clinton decided with Kim Yong-sam, to further 
strengthen "close cooperation and cooperation system between 
South Korea and the United States." 
  The United States dispatched secret envoys to Tokyo in March 
and May, 1991, to urge Japan to take a joint action with South 
Korea and the United States in the negotiations for diplomatic 
relations with the North and restrain from economic assistance 
until the North received nuclear inspection. At the summit 
between Bill Clinton and Morihiro Hosokawa in February last, 
they came to an agreement that resolute measures including 
sanctions are necessary unless the North accepts nuclear 
inspection." 
  Under the manipulation of the United States, the South 
Korean 
and Japanese authorities have acted a shock brigade in the 
nuclear clamour. 
  The United States has enlarged "the nuclear issue of the 
North" as an international issue by mobilizing its allies with 
the "cooperation system" of the U.S., Japan and South Korea as 
the axis and international organizations under its influence. 
  After bringing "the nuclear issue of the North" to the 
United 
Nations by abusing the IAEA, it had an unreasonable "resolution" 
demanding nuclear inspection of the North adopted at the 48th UN 
General Assembly session in November last year. And it invented 
"a presidential statement" of the UN Security Council on March 
31, 1994, demanding the "completion of inspections." It 
intensified pressure upon Pyongyang, setting a deadline and 
threatening many- sided "sanctions" against it. 
  "The nuclear issue" fabricated by Washington is "a means of 
stifling socialism of the North by collective sanctions as the 
"strategy of peaceful transition" is impossible to destroy it" 
and "nuclear inspection" is "preliminaries for detecting the 
North's military facilities to disarm, incapacitate and open it 
under the pax-Americana order." 
  The United States must not try to use the fictitious 
"nuclear 
issue of the North" for destroying the North's socialism, 
selling arms to South Korea and maintaining its troops and 
nuclear weapons in South Korea but choose package solution for 
resolving the Korean nuclear problem and normalizing ties with 
the DPRK as it announced to the world in the DPRK-USA joint 
statement.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front 
(Hanminjon) [SKNDF] made public a statement denouncing the South 
Korean puppets and the Japanese authorities for trying to 
accelerate their nuclear armament by a new method, according to 
a report of radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul. 
  Noting that the South Korean and Japanese authorities who 
have concealed their moves for nuclear armament for the recent 
several years and acted as shock brigades in the U.S. nuclear 
row against the DPRK announced the development of a new 
modified version of light-water reactors simultaneously, the 
spokesman said: This is a trick to evade the denunciation of 
the world public away from them in a crafty way and press on 
with the development of nuclear weapons. 
  The modified version of light water reactors the South 
Korean 
and Japanese authorities are intending to develop are plutonium 
reactors under changed name, he noted, adding: The South Korean 
and Japanese authorities must not employ petty tricks but give 
up, first of all, the development of the modified version of 
light-water reactors and fast-breeder reactors intended to 
deceive the world opinion, and dismantle the heavy-water 
reactors and reprocessing facilities now in use for the 
development of nuclear weapons. 
  The spokesman expressed the hope that the governments, 
political parties, organisations and peaceloving people of all 
countries will look squarely at the substantial moves of the 
South Korean and Japanese authorities for nuclear armament and 
lift up louder voices to check them.

<F P=106> ["Kim Yong-sam Group's Criminal Act of Throwing People Into </F>
`Nuclear Hell'"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) [SKNDF] 
in a protest message to the traitor Kim Yong-sam May 23 accused 
the traitor of his treason in doing harm to the fellow 
countrymen and working overtime to develop nuclear weapons and 
provoke a nuclear war for destroying the nation in league with 
outside forces, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National 
Salvation reported. 
  Referring to the treacheries committed by Kim Yong-sam 
against the fellow countrymen, hand in glove with foreign 
forces, the message said the present regime had tried hard to 
strengthen an "international cooperation system" designed to 
stifle the North, where fellow countrymen live, and made the 
Korean peninsula a theatre of scramble of nuclear powers by 
taking the unfounded "nuclear issue" of the North even to the 
United Nations, regarding the "system of cooperation with the 
U.S. and Japan" as the main axis. 
  Criticizing the traitor Kim Yong-sam's perfidious acts of 
reversing the North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation 
and racing headlong along the road of nuclear armament, the 
message said the present "civilian" regime is not only 
extracting a large amount of nuclear materials from the Wolsong 
heavy water reactor and Taedok multi-purpose research reactor, 
plutonium-yielding reactors built by the preceding military 
regimes, but also promoting even the development of a fast 
breeder reactor, openly crying for "nuclear sovereignty" to 
justify its development of nuclear weapons. 
  Kim Yong-sam's criminal acts to stifle the fellow countrymen 
and throw the people into a "nuclear hell" cannot be tolerated 
any longer, the message said, and added: In case one of the 
nine atomic reactors operating in South Korea and nuclear waste 
accumulated there should explode in actuality, they would emit 
radioactivity that may cause a hideous pollution more than 
10,000 times as great as the total pollution at the time of 
A-bomb dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

<F P=106> [Unattributed Talk: "Our Principled Stance on the Nuclear </F>
Suspicion Commotions"] 
  [Text] The great leader comrade, in his answers to 
questions raised by the director general of the PRENSA LATINA 
News Agency of Cuba, has expounded extensively on our principled 
stance on the nuclear suspicion commotions perpetrated by the 
reactionaries at home and abroad while finding faults with us. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The 
government of our Republic is striving consistently to realize 
the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. It is a 
consistent stand of our party and the government of our Republic 
to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  We have already put forth on several occasions the most 
reasonable and fair proposals and suggestions for the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and are doing all we 
can for its realization. However, the United States and the 
South Korean authorities are viciously clinging to the 
anti-Republic commotions, finding fault with the fictitious 
nuclear issue of ours. The nuclear suspicion commotions staged 
by the United States and the South Korean authorities while 
absurdly placing blame on us are an extremely unjust act that 
will never get through anywhere. 
  Its purpose is to strengthen the country's power industry 
base while speaking of our country's nuclear activities. Our 
nuclear program is, to all intents and purposes, peaceful. We 
have clarified more than once that we have neither any intention 
nor capability to develop nuclear weapons. The whole world knows 
about this. As a matter of fact, we feel no need to develop 
them and, even if we were to manufacture one or two of them, 
they would be useless. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has been raised by 
the United States, not by us, which brought in the nuclear 
weapons into South Korea and posed the nuclear threats against 
us. As has already been exposed, the United States occupied 
South Korea, a strategic point, and brought massive nuclear 
weapons into South Korea from the mid-1950's to realize its 
aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy opposing our Republic. Since 
then, South Korea has been turned into a nuclear advanced base 
which is the largest in the Far East region in which some 1,000 
U.S. made-nuclear weapons of various type are deployed. In 
order to make a preemptive nuclear attack on us, extremely 
dangerous nuclear war exercises, such as the Team Spirit joint 
military exercise, are continuously staged in South Korea. 
  This shows that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula 
has 
cropped up entirely due to the United States and the South 
Korean authorities. This is also clear proof that the nuclear 
threat comes from the South, not from the North. Regardless, 
the United States is frenzied in the nuclear suspicion 
commotions while placing blame on us. In recent years, the Cold 
War has ended internationally and the non-aggression agreement 
and the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula have been adopted between the North and South. Under 
such conditions, the United States has lost any justification 
for the presence of the nuclear weapons and aggressive troops in 
South Korea. Therefore, the United States has conjured up a 
fictitious nuclear suspicion about us and is deliberately 
increasing the tension on the Korean peninsula to a critical 
point so as to trump up an excuse for a continued occupation of 
South Korea and in order to isolate [korip] and crush [apsal] 
our republic which is advancing under the banner of socialism. 
The South Korean authorities are also frenzied in the new war 
provocation maneuvers, following the U.S. nuclear commotions, to 
crush the fellow countrymen with swords borrowed from outside 
forces so as to achieve reunification by prevailing over 
communism. 
  The United States and the South Korean authorities, the ones 
who brought the issue of nuclear threats on the Korean 
peninsula, are perpetrating the nuclear suspicion commotions by 
placing blame on us who have neither will nor capacity nor need 
to develop nuclear weapons. This is an act like a thief turning 
on the victim with a club and should never be tolerated. 
  Since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has stemmed 
from the United States' hostile policy towards the DPRK, it must 
be resolved through dialogue between us and the United States. 
The United States also admitted the need and negotiated with 
the DPRK last year. The joint statement agreed upon and 
published by both sides at the talks points out explicitly that 
the United States should not pose nuclear threats against us; 
that both countries should respect each other's sovereignty and 
should not interfere in domestic affairs; and that they support 
the peaceful reunification of Korea. However, the United States 
has overturned the agreements it reached with us and brought the 
DPRK-U.S. talks to a rupture, driving the situation in our 
country to extremity and setting even international 
organizations in motion to put pressure upon us. This shows that 
the United States is persistently adhering to the anti-Republic 
maneuver even after the announcement of the DPRK-U.S. joint 
statement. 
  However, pressure can never be a solution to the problem. It 
is a miscalculation if it thinks that our people who regard 
independence as their lifeblood, will be brought to their knees 
by means of pressure and force. If the United States continues 
to clamor for putting pressure on our republic, we will be 
compelled to take due measures of self-defense to safeguard the 
dignity of our nation and the sovereignty of our country. 
  Whether the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is 
resolved 
in a peaceful way or not depends entirely on the attitude of the 
United States. If the United States sincerely wishes the 
resolution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it must 
suspend the international pressure commotions against our 
republic and take a sincere attitude towards the DPRK-U.S. 
talks. International organizations must not comply with the 
unjust demands of a big country, but abide by the principles of 
justice and fairness to render contribution to the resolution of 
the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 26 May commentary: "Servants of Aggressors"] </F>
  [Text] As is known, the South Korean puppet navy will 
participate in the Rimpac joint operation -- which will be 
conducted in the western waters off the Pacific from late May to 
the mid-July -- by being assigned to a combined fleet of the 
U.S. Navy and the Japanese self-defense navy. 
  Japan, since 1980, and the South Korean puppets, since 1990, 
have participated in the joint military exercise, which has been 
conducted every two years in the Pacific Ocean under the baton 
of the United States since the early 1970's. This will be, 
however, the first time the puppet South Korean Navy will 
participate in the joint operation, thus being assigned to the 
combined fleet of the United States and Japan. 
  Regarding this, an official of the Japanese Defense Agency 
made it plain that the joint operation in Rimpac will be a 
political message to North Korea's nuclear program. This shows 
that the joint operations by the United States, Japan, and South 
Korea in the Rimpac joint military exercise are a dangerous 
military action directed at our Republic. 
  It is well-known that the Rimpac joint military exercise -- 
in which the United States' massive armed forces, including the 
armed forces of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region that 
follow the United States, will participate -- is a product of 
the United States' aggressive global strategy and its ambition 
to dominate the world, and that it is also the commotion of 
nuclear war based on its aggressive plan to strengthen its naval 
strategy and to raise the nuclear attack capability in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  In particular, the United States has intended to facilitate 
the formation of the U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military 
alliance and, at the same time, to establish a collective 
security system involving the whole of the Asian-Pacific region 
by inveigling the South Korean puppet army and Japan into the 
joint military exercise. 
  The U.S. hardline conservative forces are now giving impetus 
to increasing military buildup and to preparing the nuclear war 
under the pretext of the so-called nuclear issue, while talking 
about sanctions against us. Taking advantage of this, the 
Japanese reactionaries have strengthened their anti-Republic 
plots by making an attempt to enact registration in preparation 
for the emergency situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  The South Korean puppets, by being a shock brigade of the 
imperialist reactionaries' commotion of nuclear pressure against 
us, have babbled about the international cooperative system and 
the strong steps against the North and, also, are 
indiscriminately running about to commit an act of crushing 
[apsal] the same fellow countrymen and to exterminate [myolsal] 
the whole nation with the backing of outside forces. 
  Under these circumstances, the puppet South Korean navy has 
planned to participate in the joint operation this time by even 
joining the combined fleet of the U.S. and Japanese armed 
forces. This clearly shows that the U.S.-Japan-South Korea 
triangular military alliance system, which has been formed to 
crush the Asian socialist countries including our country, has 
entered the stage in which it is being operated practically. 
  The Korean peninsula is the first target in the new military 
strategy of the United States, which seeks a new world order 
after the end of the Cold War. Also, it is the invariable goal 
pursued by the United States in its aggressive Asia-Pacific 
strategy to put the Korean people on the altar of a nuclear war. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is actively behaving as a shock 
brigade in the execution of this criminal aggressive strategy 
and, also, is fully revealing its true color as a faithful war 
servant of the United States and a group of traitors trying to 
slay the fellow countrymen in collision with outside forces. 
  We have put forward a proposal for negotiations to establish 
a new peace guarantee system [pyonghwa pojang chegye], which 
will replace the Military Armistice Commission, in order to 
secure durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula and 
are making efforts for its realization. At this juncture, the 
South Korean puppets are actively participating in the United 
States' adventurous military action against us. This is a grave 
criminal act of running counter to detente and peace on the 
Korean peninsula and of posing a threat to peace on Korea and 
Asia, as well as an unforgivable challenge to our people, the 
people in the Asian socialist countries, and those ones in the 
countries of the Asia-Pacific region. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to maintain its unstable 
power in return for its service as a servant and a shock brigade 
of the U.S. aggression and its war policy and to achieve its 
ambition to reunify the country by a Northward invasion with the 
arms of force. This is, however, a foolish act. 
  The South Korean puppets must stop committing a reckless act 
of serving the United States' perilous policy of war, clearly 
being aware that they have nothing to get from toeing outside 
forces' policy of strength.

<F P=106> ["Crafty Sermon To Destroy Labor Movement"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
reportedly called together presidents of business groups and 
trade union chiefs and told them that businesses successful in 
"labor- management cooperation" would be aided but no profits 
would be brought to those under disputes. He also raved that 
the workers, entrepreneurs and "government" should all make 
every possible effort to make this year the first year of 
"labor-management cooperation". 
  Commenting on this, a MINJU CHOSON analyst today says it is 
another crafty sermon aimed at destroying the labor movement. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam's call for concerted efforts of the 
workers, entrepreneurs and "government" stems from his ulterior 
intention to benumb the fighting consciousness of workers 
through tieup between the puppet authorities and comprador 
business men. 
  He blared that workers should completely discard the concept 
of the past that antagonism and struggle are the only way of 
living. This means, in the final analysis, that workers should 
not put any any demand, not wage any struggle but meekly obey 
the acts of exploitation by entrepreneurs. 
  His talk about active support for the businesses successful 
in "labor-management cooperation" and no profits for those under 
disputes means that privileges and special favor will be granted 
to the comprador businesses and that the authorities and 
entrepreneurs will contain the labor moement of workers through 
their tieup. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam, flocking together with the 
comprador clan which battens on the sweat and blood of people, 
will never stand on the side of workers.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang mass meeting 
was held today to welcome the family of Kim Chae-su who defected 
to the northern half of Korea. 
  Kim Chae-su, born in Chunchon City, South Korean Kangwon 
Province, served as a ground man at a puppet airforce flying 
corps and an airline company and as a crime-prevention team 
member at a police booth and ran an aquatic products company 
with his wife Mun Chong-cha till defecting to the North. 
  Orders and monetary prize were awarded to Kim Chae-su and 
Mun 
Chong-cha at the meeting. 
  In his welcome speech, Sin An-pang, vice-chairman of the 
Pyongyang Municipal Administration and Economic Committee, 
warmly welcomed the family of Kim Chae-su who defected to the 
North, believing that the socialist system of the North is a 
place where people can live a worthy life. 
  In his reply speech, Kim Chae-su said the North is a 
paradise 
where the state regards the people as heaven and spares nothing 
for them, whereas the South is a society where the rulers serve 
the United States as if it were their grandfather while 
oppressing and bleeding the people white for the interests of 
the comprador businesses and military bureaucrats. 
  "Kim Yong-sam advertised 'civilian politics' as if he would 
to do something for the nation and the people, but he is also an 
A-class traitor and a typical model of exploiter," said Kim 
Chae-su. 
  In her reply speech, Mun Chong-cha said: "In the North, I 
feel as if I had come to heaven from the hell. I believe it is 
thanks to the benevolent politics of the great President Kim 
Il-song and dear Mr. Kim Chong-il that the northern society has 
become a large harmonious family where all people live without 
any worries." 
  "I pledge that I will uphold dear General Kim Chong-il and 
remain loyal to his leadership together with my husband in order 
to consolidate and develop the excellent socialist system of the 
DPRK without an equal in the world," she declared.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The second meeting of 
the joint presidium of the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) was held successfully today despite 
the obstructions of the South Korean authorities. 
  The meeting was held by phones between Pyongyang, Seoul and 
Tokyo as had been decided upon by the Pomminnyon organisations 
in the North and the South of Korea and overseas. 
  The meeting was attended by Chairman Paek In-chun and other

  The agreement says the meeting was held for the first time 
after the programme and statutes of Pomminnyon were confirmed

of the outside forces of the United States and Japan and some 
forces following them to increase the tensions and provoke a war 
over the socalled "nuclear issue of the North" and in laying the 
basis for durable peace and independent reunification on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  "At the meeting, we sincerely discussed how to build up 
close 
ranks of great national unity and how to achieve national 
independence and peaceful reunification on the basis of 
reconciliation and unity of the 70 million Koreans in the North, 
South and overseas and reached a consensus of views on all the 
agenda items," says the agreement. 
  According to the agreement, the fifth pan-national rally 
will 
be held from August 10 to 15 this year. 
  Emphasized in the agreement are matters of conducting 
various 
forms of functions to widely explain the national-historic 
significance of the excavation of the Tomb of Tangun and boost 
the national pride, of waging a joint movement for the formation 
of the South side headquarters of Pomminnyon, strengthening the 
solidarity movement between the regional organisations, and 
matters of exchanging visits between the North, the South and 
abroad and waging a struggle against the rice market opening to 
the United States and its nuclear clamour. 
  At a press conference held today, Chairman Paek In-chun 
briefed home and foreign reporters on the meeting and read out 
the agreement of the second meeting of the joint Presidium of 
Pomminnyon.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- Foreign political 
parties and organisations urged the United States to immediately 
accede to the DPRK's peace proposal for replacing the Korean 
armistice agreement with a peace agreement and establishing a 
new peace arrangement, which is contained in the April 28 
statement of the DPRK Foreign Ministry. 
  The political bureau of the New Party of the Congress for 
the 
Independence of Madagascar in a statement May 15 said the DPRK 
is making sincere efforts to remove nuclear threat on the Korean 
peninsula and defend peace and security in this part of the 
world. 
  It is reasonable and judicious to find a peaceful solution 
to 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-USA 
talks, said the statement, adding that the party wants the 
continuation of the DPRK-USA talks and that impartiality must be 
ensured in the settlement of the nuclear issue. 
  The Uganda-DPRK Friendship Association and the Ugandan 
National Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea in a joint 
statement May 19 said the continuation of the dangerous state of 
ceasefire on the Korean peninsula is abnormal in every respect. 
  If the United States truly wants peace and security in 
Korea, 
it must accept the peace overture of the DPRK side and come out 
to negotiation with the DPRK without delay, the statement 
demanded. 
  Sayfuddin Chowdhry, member of parliament and floor leader 
(secretary-general) of the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of India (Marxist), in an interview with KCNA in New Delhi 
May 17 said: "We strongly demand the United States stop the 
reckless military provocations against the Korean people and 
immediately respond to the constructive peace overture of the 
DPRK."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The local industry is 
developing in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  According to statistical data, the output value of the 
Ministry of Local Industry in less than five months jumped 72 
percent above the comparable period last year. 
  In this period, the modernization level of the local 
industrial factories went up and the output of major consumer 
goods leaped 20 percent. 
  In the same period, South Pyongan Provincial General Bureau 
of Local Industry lifted the industrial output value to 300 
percent and output of major consumer goods to 180 percent by 
actively mobilizing production potentials and reserves. 
  Local industrial factories in South Hwanghae, Chagang and 
Kangwon Provinces have nearly doubled the output of mass 
consumption goods in the last one month by upgrading the 
modernization level of the production processes on the basis of 
advanced technologies and introducing advanced methods into 
production. 
  The foodstuff factories under the Pyongyang Municipal 
Associated Bureau of Local Industry including the Pyongyang 
conrnstach factory, the Taedonggang foodstuff chemical factory 
and the Chunghwa and Kangnam general foodstuff factories 
increased in four months or more the foodstuff output 40 percent 
above that in the same period last year.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- Korean scientists and 
technicians came up with more than 140,000 inventions and 
technical innovation proposals contributing to the 
implementation of the Workers' Party of Korea's revolutionary 
economic strategy in the last one year. 
  New breeds and farm machines invented by the Academy of 
Agricultural Science are now very effective in practice. 
  The Kum Song General Tractor Works, the Chongpyong Farm 
Machine Accessories Factory and cooperative farms in Pyongwon 
and Chungsan Counties manufactured new-type weeding machines, 
granulated fertilizer and manuring machines and other machines 
and solved technical problems in raising the effectiveness of 
fertilizers and preventing damages from noxious insects and are 
widely using them in agricultural production. 
  Tens of thousands of inventions and technical innovation 
proposals have been introduced in production in the light 
industrial sector. They include a new pattern loom of high 
economic effectiveness and a technology of papermaking by use of 
fibre in waste water. 
  Besides, many scientific and technological problems, such as 
a high pressure pipe heater and a new coal-cutting method, have 
been successfully solved in various fields of the national 
economy including the coal, power, metal, electronics and 
automation industries.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- A productive upsurge has 
been effected at the Sariwon textile mill, the nation's 
well-known fibre production base. 
  The mill topped its first quarterly plan this year by 2 
percent and is now fulfilling daily quotas at more than 120 
percent with the goal of hitting the first six months' target 
ahead of schedule. 
  The mill is situated in the western part of North Hwanghae 
Province 56 kilometres south of Pyongyang. 
  The output and variety of textiles are on an annual increase 
at the mill. 
  Its total industrial output value now is 6.2 times that 20 
years ago; cotton yarn output 1.4 times, textiles output 3 times 
and processed textiles output 6.3 times. 
  The mill which had put out only a few kinds of cloth in the 
past now mass-produces over 40 kinds of refined-pattern and 
high-quality textiles including high-quality suit cloth, shirt 
cloth, water-resistant cloth, linings, printed cotton and 
processed plastic cloth. 
  Several ten million metres of high-quality textiles are 
produced annually by the mill and they are exported to foreign 
countries and supplied to the population of the country. 
  The material and technical foundations of the mill have been 
consolidated immensely. 
  Workers and technicians there have made more than 1,000 
kinds 
of accessories by their own efforts to remodel along modern 
lines several hundred machines including shinning machines, 
shuttleless knitters and hydraulic press looms. They have 
manufactured printing machines also by their own efforts and 
introduced them in production. 
  Thus, the number of spinning machines has increased 11 
times, 
weaving machines 3.8 times and printing machines 5 times at the 
mill over the past 20 years. 
  A repair base has also been consolidated. 
  A large number of innovators and thousands of recipients of 
state decorations have been produced there in this course. 
  A well-arranged study-while-working higher educational base 
at the mill annually rears several hundred technicians and 
skilled workers.

  [Text] In response to North Korea's repeated proposal put 
forth on 25 May to hold a national meeting on 15 August 
[national liberation anniversary], the National Unification 
Board [NUB] repeatedly urged today that an exhausting political 
propaganda should be immediately stopped, pointing out that the 
first priority for a substantive advance in South-North 
relations at the present moment is to clear away the suspicion 
of North Korea's nuclear development. 
  In a commentary, NUB spokesman Kim Yong-ki recalled that the 
ROK Government has already made clear its position that holding 
a national meeting on 15 August is not at all conducive to the 
solution to the nuclear issue and to the improvement in the 
South- North relations. He emphasized that if North Korea 
really takes the nation into consideration, it should show all 
sincerity in solving the nuclear issue.

  [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government on Thursday reaffirmed the importance of abiding by 
the inter-Korean declaration of the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The government also resolved to continue to cooperate 
closely 
with the United States and the rest of the world community in 
the effort to rectify North Korea's violation of the 
denuclearization declaration. 
  At a unification and national security policy coordination 
meeting presided over by Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku, the 
government decided to continue to maintain the existing policy 
of linking inter-Korean economic cooperation to the resolution 
of the North Korean nuclear question. 
  A Unification Board official said that the meeting, however, 
decided to make flexible conditions for such linkage depending 
on the attitude of North Korea. 
  He said attendees shared the view that it is not proper to 
discuss the issue of reconsidering the denuclearization 
declaration at the present stage. 
  Regarding North Korea's demand for the replacement of the 
existing military armistice agreement, the meeting reaffirmed 
the government policy that such a replacement should be 
discussed between the two Koreas once confience-building is 
fostered in the areas of politics and military between the two 
sides. 
  "Attending officials affirmed that the linkage of economic 
cooperation to the nuclear issue cannot be withdrawn," said Kim 
Hyong-ki, spokesman for the National Unification Board. 
  The attendees also expressed concern about a situation in 
which North Korea may refuse to provide nuclear transparency, 
challenging South Korea's efforts to abide by the 
denuclearization declaration, Kim added.

  [Text] The government on 26 May reconfirmed the position 
that the declaration on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
should be observed and decided to resolutely deal with it if 
North Korea ignores our efforts for the implementation of this 
declaration. 
  The government decided this at a meeting of the Unification 
and Security Policy Coordinating Committee chaired by Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of National Unification Board [NUB] 
Yi Hong- ku held on 26 May. 
  Kim Hyong-ki, an NUB spokesman, said, "The participants in 
the meeting agreed that if North Korea refuses to clear away the 
suspicion of its nuclear development and continues to enforce 
the nuclear program, our efforts to abide by the 
denuclearization declaration will meet with grave challenge." 
  The meeting noted that North Korea is persistently pushing 
ahead with its scheme to reach a package solution to its nuclear 
issue linking it with the establishment of diplomatic relations 
with the United States and the signing of a peace agreement. 
The meeting made it clear that the issue of replacing the 
Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement should be discussed 
between the North and the South along with the issue of 
political and military confidence- building between the North 
and the South. The government also reconfirmed its policy that 
it will continue to link the nuclear issue and the economic 
cooperation for the time being.

    [Editorial Report] On 25 May, ROK vernacular newspapers 
carry articles reacting to remarks made by Yi Hong-ku, deputy 
prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board, 
at the National Assembly on 23 May to the effect that the ROK 
will reconsider the joint declaration on denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula if North Korea continues maintaining its 
radiochemical laboratory. 
  On page 2, the conservative CHOSON ILBO carries a 700-word 
article by reporter An Hui-chang which says that the unification 
minister's remarks reflect the government's strong will to see 
that "the nuclear transparency of North Korea is secured by any 
means." The article quotes Minister Yi's remarks made on 12 May 
in a confab with the members of the Korean Newspaper Editor's 
Association of Korea, where he said that "the declaration on 
denuclearization will be nullified if it is internationally 
confirmed that North Korea possesses even half a nuclear 
weapon...." The article says that his remarks have presented 
our somewhat disoriented nuclear policy with a clear-cut 
direction policy. The article quotes Minister Yi as saying that 
the joint declaration has virtually been nullified in any sense, 
adding that the ROK Government has been coping with North 
Korea's nuclear issue from the standpoint of sticking to the 
joint declaration--although North Korea has violated it--with a 
view to preventing a nuclear domino phenomenon while, at the 
same time, taking the U.S. position into consideration. The 
article stresses that our government cannot concede on the point 
of securing nuclear transparency and that our government is 
sending a message to the international community, including the 
United States and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], 
that they should pay attention to this point. The article says 
that this is a message indicating that "the ROK Government will 
not just sit idle" if North Korea continues to ignore the joint 
declaration and the United States tolerates this in the process 
of their negotiations. The article concludes by saying that his 
remarks seem to indicate that the ROK Government is seriously 
considering the nullification of the joint declaration and that 
this may have a ripple effect on the third round U.S.-North 
talks. 
  On page 3, the CHOSON ILBO carries an 800-word editorial 
which says that Minister Yi's remarks are "a diversionary 
message" and showed concern over the United States trying to 
seek a settlement with North Korea while allowing it to possess 
one or two nuclear bomb. Adding that the remarks are bringing 
North Korea's attention to the possible ripple effect that the 
nullification of the joint declaration will create, the 
editorial says that if North Korea guarantees nuclear 
transparency, it will be possible for both South and North Korea 
to have nuclear technological sovereignty in the peaceful use of 
nuclear energy, adding that Minister Yi's remarks are a sign of 
change in the ROK Government's policy toward North Korea's 
nuclear issue. The editorial stressed that the cooperative 
system between the ROK and the United States should be further 
consolidated. 
  On page 5, the moderate TONG-A ILBO carries an 800-word 
article by reporter Pak Che-kyun which says, in essence, that 
the ROK Government has been trying to put out the fire which was 
ignited by Minister Yi's remarks. The article cites Article 
Three of the joint declaration which says "the South and North 
shall not possess nuclear reprocessing facilities and uranium 
enriching facilities," quoting experts' worry about the possible 
difficulties the ROK might face in case it should give up 
reprocessing facilities, while adding that "the United States, 
which has potential fears for the nuclear weapons development of 
North and South Korea, had applied strong pressure on 
stipulating the clause of 'giving up reprocessing.'" The article 
continues to say that "the ROK Government is now in a position 
to flatly negate the minister's remarks on reconsidering the 
joint declaration" because both the ROK and the United States 
are basing their opposition against North Korea's nuclear 
development upon that declaration. The article concludes by 
saying that "if the United States takes issue with his remarks, 
there will be a great stir." 
  On page 5, the moderate HANGUK ILBO carries a 1,100-word 
article by reporter Yu Sung-u which says that the ROK 
Government's foreign affairs-national security team led by 
Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong- ku has been boldly taking issue 
with the efficacy of the joint declaration. The article says 
that his remarks are based on a matter-of-course principle in 
view of Article Three of the joint declaration, saying that the 
ROK Government's attitude of making an issue of the efficacy of 
the joint declaration has been necessitated by the present 
circumstances under which the ROK is entrusting the United 
States with the negotiations with North Korea on the nuclear 
issue. The article says that his remarks are "a conditional or 
a passive declaration of nuclear sovereignty to the United 
States and Japan as well as to North Korea," adding that an 
imbalance between the South and North exists in that the ROK 
side has given up even the development of nuclear reprocessing 
technology while North Korea's extraction of plutonium is an 
issue. The article concludes that it is high time that a 
serious examination of the merits and demerits achieved since 
the signing of the South-North Basic Agreement and the joint 
declaration by South and North Korea. 
  On page 4, the pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries a 
1,300-word article by reporter Ku Pon-yong which is essentially 
the same as other vernacular dailies of 25 May. The article 
says that the unification minister's remarks make a point of 
ensuring that bargaining is not disadvantageous to the ROK and 
sends a warning to Japan whose nuclear potential is growing. 
The article concludes that his remarks have been made to 
express the government's long- term position in response to some 
people's views for advocating possessing reprocessing facilities 
for peaceful purposes under the circumstances in which the power 
generation with atomic energy constitutes 43.2 percent of total 
power generated. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word editorial entitled "The Condition for the 
Reconsideration of the Denuclerization on the Korean Peninsula." 
Referring to the significance of remarks made by Yi Hong-ku, 
deputy prime minister and minister of the National Unification 
Board, at the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and Unification 
Committee some time ago regarding the nullification of the 
South-North Joint Denuclerization Declaration on the Korean 
peninsula, the editorial says, "it must be true that Deputy 
Minister Yi's view of North Korean policy has been based on the 
denuclerization on the Korean peninsula, but he has maintained 
that the suspicion of North Korea's nuclear development must be 
dispelled. In this respect, we have no objection to his 
remarks. It is the basic framework of the government's 
consistent policy toward North Korea. The reconsideration of 
the joint denuclerization declaration on the Korean peninsula 
means, however, that we can revise the North-South agreement 
that prohibits them from possessing a nuclear reprocessing 
facility, as well as a uranium enriching facility. When this 
happens, great changes may occur in our government's nuclear 
policy. Therefore, we cannot but pay attention to it." 
  Describing Deputy Prime Minister Yi's such remarks as a 
proposal indicating that North Korea should suspend the nuclear 
development program and, surely, guarantee the transparency of 
its nuclear development in order to ease tensions on the Korean 
peninsula, the editorial says, "he once said in a meeting with 
editors that if North Korea possesses even half of a nuclear 
bomb, the denuclerization declaration on the Korean peninsula 
will become virtually null and void. This is a clear and firm 
expression of the government's policy regarding the North Korean 
nuclear issue." 
  The editorial says, "it is certain that the competitive 
nuclear development between the North and South will bring about 
a great disaster to our nation by making this land become a 
place for nuclear confrontation. Therefore, we must concentrate 
diplomatic efforts on making North Korea abandon its nuclear 
ambition, thus further strengthening the ROK-U.S. cooperative 
system. 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 5 a 1,000-word article by 
reporter Kim Pong-son entitled "A Subtle Stir in the Country by 
Deputy Prime Minister Yi's Remarks on the Reconsideration of the 
Denuclerization Declaration on the Korean Peninsula." Referring 
to the contents of the denuclerization declaration, the article 
reports, "some domestic scholars say that the joint 
denuclerization declaration must be revised because it abandons 
its rights to even possess nuclear reprocessing facility or 
enriching facilities for peaceful purposes." 
  Noting the remarks by Kim Si-chung, minister of the Ministry 
of Science and Technology, regarding the need to revise the 
joint denuclerization declaration, the article says, "the 
government has clearly expressed the position that it will not 
revise it." Also, referring to the remarks by a spokesman of 
National Unification Board indicating that North Korea's 
operating a radiochemical laboratory is a violation of the joint 
denuclerization declaration, the article reports, "North Korea 
provides justification for South Korea to reconsider it. Also, 
its future operation of the radiochemical laboratory is a 
nullification of the declaration. Therefore, it must close the 
laboratory to avoid the dispute between the North and South." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 3 a 
1,000-word editorial entitled "The Principle of the 
Denuclerization Declaration Must Be Observed." Referring to 
Deputy Prime Minister Yi's remarks that we cannot but discuss 
the North-South Joint Denuclerization Declaration in a different 
way if North Korea continues operating the radiochemical 
facility, the editorial says, "if his remarks mean that the 
government will carry out its future nuclear policy based on the 
fact that the declaration is already null and void, we cannot 
but counter his remarks, because the joint denuclerization 
declaration, in addition to the North-South agreement, is an 
important agreement between the North and South to secure peace 
on the Korean peninsula and to achieve national reunification." 
  Noting the background of the formulation of the declaration 
between the North and South and the contents of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, the editorial says, "North Korea's 
operation of the radiochemical laboratory is not a violation of 
the treaty, even if it is a nuclear reprocessing facility, 
because the treaty does not prohibit the country concerned from 
possessing or operating it." The editorial also says, it is not 
easy to determine whether Deputy Prime Minister Yi's remarks 
"are intended to prevent North Korea's nuclear development or to 
find justification for South Korea's nuclear development." 
  HANGYORE SINMUN carries on page 2 a 700-word article by 
reporter Kang Tae-ho entitled "The Expression of the 
Government's Dissatisfaction at the U.S. Position Toward North 
Korea." Referring to the background of Deputy Prime Minister 
Yi's remarks and other government officials' remarks on need to 
revise the joint denuclerization declaration, the article then 
added, "some people believe that his remarks are a kind of an 
expression of the government's dissatisfaction at the U.S. 
Government's negotiation attitude toward North Korea with the 
approach of a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks."

  [Text] Regarding the issue pertaining to new logging 
agreement reached between Russia and North Korea, a government 
official evaluated on 24 May that "the recent agreement 
stipulates the improved treatment of North Korean loggers. This 
is a stepped-up measure," and expressed that "however, the 
government will continue its efforts to further improve loggers' 
working conditions and their human rights."

<F P=106> [Article by North Korean affairs desk reporter An Hui-chang: </F>
"Suspicion of the Status of Kim Pyong-il Who Returned Amid Rumor 
on His Seeking Political Asylum--Discord With Kim Chong-il Over 
Succession to Power"] 
  [Text] "The cases in which Kim Chong-il has exercised his 
power have been considerably reduced and major policies, 
including the nuclear issue, are being directly handled by Kim 
Il-song," and "Kim Chong-il's face, occasionally seen in public, 
does not look healthy, thus causing the people to suspect that 
something unusual is happening." Amid this situation, the 
observation that Kim Chong-il's position "is not firm" was 
quickly raised since the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth party 
Central Committee was held last December. Kim Chong-il's close 
associates, including Kim Tal-hyon, were demoted during the 
session. Under these circumstances, the movements of Kim 
Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il's half brother, are also arousing the 
people's suspicion. 
  This suspicion was prompted by the fact that Kim Pyong-il, 
who was appointed North Korean ambassador to Finland last March, 
returned to North Korea after serving only a month and a half in 
Finland, and has remained in North Korea for over a month for no 
apparent reason. 
  Kim Pyong-il did not attend a dinner arranged by the Finnish 
president for new foreign ambassadors, and hastily left Finland. 
Then, what was the reason behind Kim Pyong-il returning to his 
home country without even attending the dinner arranged by the 
president of a host country, which is regarded as an important 
event for diplomats? 
  First, people believe that he was summoned home for the 
purpose of preventing him from seeking political asylum or other 
possible unexpected acts. According to the rumor, on his way to 
the Helsinki airport to return to North Korea, Kim Pyong-il 
muttered that "It would have been better if I had sought 
political asylum." 
  It is a well-known fact that Kim Pyong-il has been subjected 
to various types of controls by Kim Chong-il. Kim Pyong-il, 
after completing the Namsan senior middle school in 1970, 
graduated from the department of politics and economy at the Kim 
Il-song University in 1976. He was then commissioned as an 
officer of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces (rank was 
unknown). 
  After graduating from the Kim Il-song Military College in 
August of 1981, Kim Pyong-il was assigned as military attache at 
the North Korean Embassy in Yugoslavia, and served until 1983. 
He served in the General Bureau of Security Guard for four years 
from 1984, and thus served in a post close to his father. In 
1988, however, he was appointed as North Korean ambassador to 
Hungary, and resumed his overseas service. Following this, Kim 
Pyong-il was appointed as ambassador to Bulgaria in February 
1989. After staying in his home country for a while, he assumed 
the post of North Korean ambassador to Finland this March. 
  The fact that the eldest son of Kim Il-song's present wife 
is 
wandering from place to place as a diplomat clearly illustrates 
that Kim Pyong-il has been regarded as a "political rival" by 
Kim Chong-il. 
  It has been learned that even after Kim Pyong-il was sent 
overseas, Kim Chong-il mercilessly purged the figures showing 
intimacy and familiarity with Kim Pyong-il among his schoolmates 
and associates. 
  Ko Yong-hwan, a former North Korean diplomat who defected to 
the ROK some time ago, explains how Kim Pyong-il has been held 
in check by Kim Chong-il. 
  "On the day Kim Pyong-il arrived in Sofia as the North 
Korean 
ambassador to Bulgaria, the embassy's party secretary directed 
the staff to greet the ambassador at the airport. However, only 
two went to the airport, including the party secretary himself, 
among some 30 embassy staff members. This was because if one 
meets Kim Pyong-il, one must prepare a report in the form of a 
document noting how long and by whose directive one met with Kim 
Pyong-il, and the content of the conversation with him, and must 
forward the report to the State Security Department." 
  Since Kim Pyong-il has been treated harshly by Kim Chong-il, 
it is possible that he may commit any kind of unexpected act, 
and this report was aimed at collecting information regarding 
his activities and preventing him from committing an unexpected 
act. His recent summoning seems to have a similar purpose. 
  The other observation has been focused on the "indication of 
abnormality" within the North Korean power structure. 
  According to remarks of the people who recently visited 
North 
Korea, including Reverend Billy Graham who visited there last 
February, Kim Il-song is personally handling overall policies. 
As a result, "delicate relations" with Kim Chong-il have been 
created. 
  In particular, the return of Kim Yong-chu--Kim Il-song's 
brother--to power as vice president after 20 years, reflects to 
a certain degree that Kim Il-song feels somewhat uneasy in 
turning over his power to Kim Chong-il. 
  However, the dominant observation is that the view that Kim 
Pyong-il's recent movements are related to Kim Chong-il's 
succession to power is premature. 
  At any rate, a precise observation of the movements within 
the North Korean power structure surrounding Kim Pyong-il will 
be possible only after his return to Finland.

  [Text] Seoul, May 27 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Friday his visit to Russia starting June 1 is part of 
Seoul's summit diplomacy to establish genuine peace on the 
Korean peninsula through "quadruple diplomacy." 
  Visiting an Air Force fighter wing, he stressed that the 
Armed Forces can exert all their strength only after winning the 
people's confidence. Accompanying the Armed Forces' 
commander-in-chief on his visit to the Air Force unit just four 
days before his state trip to Russia were Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Yi Yang-ho, 
Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Security 
Chong Chong-uk and Presidential Spokesman Chu Ton-sik, among 
others. Arriving at the wing headquarters, the president was met 
by Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Kim Hong-nae. 
  After the wing commander gave a briefing on his missions, 
Kim 
emphasized the Air Force's importance to national defense, 
exhorting both the officers and men to do their utmost in 
discharging their duties. 
  Explaining about North Korea's severe food and oil shortages 
and corruption in officialdom, he said, "This is a very 
dangerous time... I know how important a role the Air Force 
played and how strong a power it exerted in the Gulf war... I 
trust you all." 
  While touring a room for stand-by pilots, he personally 
pushed the scramble bell to see how fast the pilots could take 
off and then observed a display by F-5E fighters and Apache 
helicopters. Visiting the wing's maintenance shop, he presented 
a watch to the shop manager. 
  From the Air Force wing, he boarded a helicopter and flew to 
an Army infantry division on the central front line to check the 
division's troops deployed along the front, guided by Army Chief 
of Staff Gen. Kim Tong-chin. 
  After the Army division, he visited a Naval fleet 
headquarters to inspect the fleet, guided by Chief of Naval 
Operations Adm. Kim Hong-yol. After planting a tree in the 
headquarters compound, President Kim went on board the 
"Kyongbuk" and posed with sailors for a photograph, then lunched 
with them in the ship's mess hall.

<F P=106> [Interview with Russian Ambassador to the ROK Georgiy </F>
Kunadze by KBS anchorman Yi Yun-song; Kunadze answers in Russia 
with Korean subtitles -- place not given; recorded] 
  [Text] [Yi Yun-song] How are you? 
  [Ambassador Kunadze] How are you? 
  [Yi] I believe ROK President Kim Yong-sam's upcoming visit 
to Russia will serve as an opportunity to further deepen and 
develop ROK-Russia relations which have been promoted for the 
past four years since diplomatic relations were established. 
What does Russia expect from President Kim Yong-sam's visit to 
Russia? 
  [Kunadze] First of all, President Kim Yong-sam is like an 
old friend, and, therefore, the warmest hospitality will be 
extended to him during his visit to Russia. 
  [Yi] The Russian Government has proposed eight-party talks 
to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. The eight parties 
are North and South Korea, the United Nations, the United 
States, China, Japan, Russia, and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. What does Russia think are the prospects for 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue? And, what efforts is 
Russia making to hold the eight-party talks? 
  [Kunadze] The situation surrounding the North Korean nuclear 
issue is serious, and various methods have been sought to 
resolve this issue. Russia is optimistic about this issue. 
Therefore, Russia has proposed eight-party talks to discuss 
stability on the Korean peninsula. Still, this does not mean we 
intend to replace the on-going bilateral [as heard] talks with 
the eight-party talks. 
  [Yi] Five North Korean loggers arrived in the ROK on 18 May. 
This is a testament to how much relations between the ROK and 
Russia have developed. It has been learned that approximately 
90 other loggers hope to defect to the ROK. Will there be 
difficulties in their defection to the ROK? 
  [Kunadze] We do not know the exact number of loggers who 
want to defect to the ROK. However, it is clear what Russia 
attaches the greatest importance to in resolving this issue is 
whether each logger hopes to defect to the ROK. 
  [Yi] The ROK and Russia have failed to reach agreement on 
how Russia will repay the principal and interest of the $1.53 
million which was loaned to Russia as part of the $3 million 
loan which the ROK promised when the two countries established 
diplomatic relations. The ROK demands a repayment with goods, 
separately from the agreement of the Paris Club, a meeting of 
creditors. It has been learned, however, that Russia hopes to 
repay with weapons. Would you tell us Russia's position on this 
issue? 
  [Kunadze] Our position is simple: We are ready to repay the 
loan to the ROK. We hope to find appropriate ways to do so. 
However, I think that the fact that we cannot violate the 
resolution of the Paris Club must be put into consideration.

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgiy Kunadze, Russian ambassador to ROK, </F>
by reporter Pak Tu-sik on 24 May at the Russian Embassy in 
Samsong-tong, Kangnam-ku, Seoul] 
  [Text] [Pak Tu-sik] How do you predict the outcome of the 
upcoming ROK-Russia summit? 
  [Georgiy Kunadze] The two heads will exchange views on a 
wide 
range of matters including the international situation and 
methods for cooperation. Also, in most of the issues they 
discuss, they will be able to confirm that they have similar or 
the same points of view. I hope that this will be an 
opportunity in which the relationship between the two countries 
will be enhanced to a level of "a mature partner relationship." 
  [Pak] Among the many pending issues between the two 
countries, what attracts our interest the most is the issue of 
the $3 billion economic cooperation loan we provided to Russia 
when No Tae-u and Gorbachev were presidents. What is Russia's 
position at a time when Russia has not repaid the principal sum 
or the interest? 
  [Kunadze] I would like to make one thing clear. Our side's 
debt is half of the $3 billion. The other half was frozen by 
the ROK Government last year (in August 1993, Hong Sun-yong, the 
then vice foreign minister, announced that the execution of the 
loan of $1.53 billion would be stooped except for the already 
executed loan of $1.47 billion). We were dissatisfied with such 
a measure because it was a one-sided one, conducted without even 
receiving our consent, but Russia recognizes the duty of 
repaying the debt made during the old Soviet period. However, 
we are of the position that the repayment method must not run 
counter to the conditions that were promised at the Paris Club 
(a meeting held by Russia's creditor countries). I expect that 
this issue will be resolved in the near future. 
  [Pak] Russia is succeeding the "treaty on mutual assistance" 
with North Korea concluded during the old Soviet period. In 
this treaty, there is an article which stipulates that if there 
is a dispute on the Korean peninsula, Russia will automatically 
interfere. This is bringing about concern. 
  [Kunadze] Many people in Russia as well as the ROK talk 
about 
this article, but in reality I think there are many people who 
do not have a correct understanding of the original text. There 
is no phrase in the original text that refers to Russia's 
"automatic interference." Our interference is limited in the 
case of a non-provocative incident. Even if an incident occurs, 
Russia will make an independent decision regarding the situation 
and not insist on taking action according to the treaty. The 
position of the democratic Russian Government is that 
implementation of any treaty must be approved by the parliament 
and that the international law and the UN Charter must be put 
before the mutual treaty. 
  [Pak] When you were the vice foreign minister early last 
year, you visited North Korea and presented the issue of 
revising this treaty. Will this issue be dealt with at the 
upcoming ROK-Russia summit talks? 
  [Kunadze] Russia will not raise this issue first. This is 
an issue between Russia and North Korea. The ROK is only a 
third party. If the ROK side raises this issue, we will explain 
our position. 
  [Pak] Recently, some North Korea loggers who escaped from 
logging camps in Siberia defected to the ROK. What is the actual 
situation of the North Korean loggers in Russia and how does 
Russia plan to deal with them? 
  [Kunadze] There is not even a single case in which a North 
Korean logger is under the control of the Russian Government. 
Therefore, we do not know how many of them want to defect to the 
ROK. The issue of the status of the North Korean loggers is an 
issue from the human rights level. The Russian Constitution 
guarantees foreigners from coming and going freely. Therefore, 
if the North Korean loggers want to go the ROK, this is 
completely their personal problem. We have nothing to do with 
this problem. 
  [Pak] Recently, the Russian Government expressed great 
dissatisfaction over the ROK media's report on the issue of the 
North Korean loggers. 
  [Kunadze] We have never expressed dissatisfaction. We are 
only dissatisfied with the ROK media which is reporting as if 
Russia was interfering on how to deal with the North Korean 
loggers. Without even sufficiently explaining our position, the 
ROK media reported that the Russian Government is not allowing 
the North Korean loggers from leaving the country and that they 
are sending the loggers back to North Korea. I have never heard 
that a North Korean logger was sent to North Korea by force. 
  [Pak] When Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu visited Moscow last 
year, Russia promised to forward to the ROK documents on the 25 
June war. Will this promise be kept? 
  [Kunadze] There is no difficulty in delivering the material. 
Since the amount of material is enormous and research over this 
matter is difficult, I believe it would be good if a special 
committee was formed between the two countries to work on this 
jointly. 
  [Pak] What is the level of North Korea's nuclear development 
to the knowledge of Russia? 
  [Kunadze] According to the information Russia has, there is 
no possibility that North Korea produced nuclear weapons. 
However, we believe that North Korea must unconditionally 
implement the duties of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Our 
position has been since last March that we are not providing any 
atomic energy technology to North Korea as long as North Korea 
does not implement the treaty. 
  [Pak] What is background for having proposed an eight-party 
meeting of the South and North Korea, the United States, Japan, 
China, Russia, the United Nations, and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue? 
  [Kunadze] This proposal is beneficial to all. A new form is 
being added to the existing framework of the talks. It will be 
an opportunity for the South and North to have contacts with 
each other at a time when the South-North dialogue has broken.

  [Text] Seoul, May 27 (YONHAP) -- South Korean investment in 
countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS) is increasing rapidly, the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. 
(KOTRA) said Friday. 
  Government permits granted for Korean enterprises' 
investment 
in the CIS region totaled 28 cases last year, compared to 21 for 
the four years between 1989 and 1992. 
  Among the CIS countries, Russia topped the Korean investment 
list with 23 cases last year, of which the Far Eastern and 
Siberian region claimed 15. 
  In contrast, investment in Moscow came to only five cases. 
  KOTRA has advised Korean businesses to hike investment in 
the 
region around Lake Baikal, where natural resources are abundant 
and geographical conditions are good, and the Ural mountains, 
which is Russia's biggest industrial region. 
  Among investments, those in machinery and facilities are 
promising since Russian state-run enterprises and munitions 
factories are being converted into civilian industry and 
privatized, according to KOTRA. 
  Korean businesses need to secure stability by forming a 
consortium to invest in resources development, because 
investments require an enormous amount of money and time, KOTRA 
said. 
  Businesses should seek to reduce risks until Russia's 
political and economic systems stabilize by focusing on small 
investments.

<F P=106> [By Kim Chung-kun from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] It was learned on 26 May that Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin will visit the ROK in November. His ROK visit will 
be a return visit to President Kim Yong-sam's March visit to 
China, and will be the first occasion for a Chinese president to 
visit the ROK in the history of ROK-Chinese relations. 
  The ROK and Chinese Governments have continued negotiations 
on President Jiang's ROK visit since 1992, when the two 
countries established diplomatic ties and former President No 
Tae-u visited China. They have recently made a rapid progress in 
the negotiations and generally agreed to the principle that he 
will visit the ROK in November. 
  According to the agreement, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister 
Tang Jiaxuan will come to Seoul on 4 June to discuss with the 
ROK Government the details of President Jiang's ROK visit. 
  While confirming Vice Minister Tang's planned visit to the 
ROK, a Western source in Beijing said on 26 May: "I understand 
that, during Vice Minister Tang's stay in the ROK, the two 
countries will discuss various pending issues, including the 
issue concerning President Jiang's ROK visit." 
  The source also said: "It is highly possible that President 
Jiang Zemin will visit the ROK and Indonesia in succession." 
  Regarding this, a high-ranking source of China said on 26 
May: "There will be no problem for the Chinese leader to visit 
the ROK in the latter half of the year, in view of progress made 
in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue." The source added: 
"The Chinese leader's ROK visit will serve as a remarkable 
turning point not only in the partnership between the two 
countries, but also in relations between South and North Korea."

  [Text] Seoul, May 27 (YONHAP) -- Sri Lankan Prime Minister 
Ranil Wickremesinghe urged North Korea Friday to fulfill its 
obligations as a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty (NPT) to eliminate nuclear weapons from the world. 
  "We would like to see the world free of nuclear weapons, 
firstly through nuclear weapons control, secondly through 
gradual reduction and finally through elimination of nuclear 
weapons from the world. North Korea should fulfill its 
obligations as a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty," 
said the Sri Lankan premier on the last day of his four-day 
visit to Seoul. 
  Wickremesinghe, however, would not elaborate on whether 
Colombo would join the United Nations Security Council in 
imposing sanctions on Pyongyang, simply saying that "discussion 
is going on about the matter at the United Nations and we would 
go along with the UN decisions as a UN member state." 
  Speaking to reporters at a news conference in the hotel 
Lotte 
shortly before his departure, Sri Lanka's prime minister 
disclosed no details of his talks with South Korean officials on 
the two countries' separate bids for a non-permanent UNSC seat 
allocated to Asia for 1996-97. 
  "In regard to the application, I discussed the matter with 
South Korean officials but it's a matter to be solved later," 
said Wickremesinghe, adding it could be settled by the end of 
1995. 
  On the opening of a direct air route linking Seoul and 
Colombo, Wickremesinghe said that "I'd like to see it happen 
next year." However, he passed the matter on to the private 
sector, saying the two countries' airlines should reach 
commercial agreements. 
  Inviting Korean tourists and businessmen to Sri Lanka, 
Wickremesinghe stressed the political situation in his country 
is stable, although one terrorist group affects the Northeast. 
  "Political parties are discussing how to settle the 
outstanding issues in the Northeastern region. All issues 
except one have been settled between the North and East regions 
and the east has restored order and a civilian government," said 
the prime minister, who voiced hope that the Northern region 
would come under Colombo's control by the end of next year. 
  The premier was hopeful that more Sri Lankans can work in 
South Korea under a Seoul Government plan to import labor, 
noting that he had discussed the issue with Seoul officials. He 
said 1,000 Sri Lankans work here at present. 
  During his meetings with South Korean officials, 
Wickremesinghe said he expressed his country's willingness to 
offer top treatment to South Korean businessmen in Sri Lanka. 
  Sri Lankan businessmen from the nation's six largest 
business 
groups, who accompanied Wickremesinghe to Seoul, also had 
comprehensive talks with their South Korean counterparts on 
promoting further business opportunities, Wickremesinghe said. 
  The 46-year-old premier, concurrently minister of 
industries, 
science and technology, leads a friendship association of 
parliamentarians between the two countries. This was the third 
visit to Seoul by Wickremesinghe, who came here in 1984 as 
education minister and in 1989 as minister of industries, 
science, and technology.

  [Text] Today, President Kim Yong-sam pointed out: "This is 
a very dangerous time because North Korea may give rise to any 
situation at any time," and stressed an attitude of vigilance 
against North Korea. 
  President Kim, visiting an unidentified ROK Air Force 
combat- 
fighter corps this morning, was briefed on the status of the 
corps. He said that "North Korea is in an extremely difficult 
situation which we can hardly imagine," and asked officers and 
men of the corps to assume a firm alert posture for an emergency. 
  President Kim revealed that "North Korea has suspended the 
operation of many plants and closed them. Their number exceeds 
what we had estimated. Besides, electric power is supplied to 
farms only three hours a day. The voltage is so low that it is 
difficult to watch television. Many soldiers are ill-fed due to 
food shortages, and the unit composed of soldiers suffering 
undernourishment is being managed separately." 
  President Kim also emphasized that "despite the shortage of 
food and oil, North Korea is staging Air Force exercises 
frequently and its flight training extended even to areas close 
to the armistice line. Peace on the Korean peninsula can be 
maintained only with our power, and if we fail to have it, 
peace can never be maintained." 
  President Kim revealed that "about 15,000 North Korean 
loggers are working in Russia, and 100 of them sought political 
asylum at our embassy." 
  Following his visit to this combat fighter corps, President 
Kim inspected a certain ROK Army division in the eastern front 
line and the headquarters of a certain naval fleet.

  [Text] Kwangju, May 27 (YONHAP) -- Tension is mounting in 
this southwestern city as students from across the country 
arrive to celebrate the eve of the sailing of the second-term 
Hanchongnyon (the Korea Federation of Student Councils). 
  The nationwide student organization will hold its main event 
Saturday at the Choson University stadium, where Friday 
evening's celebration is also being held. On Sunday, 
Hanchongnyon plans to stage a parade after a citizen-student 
resolution rally in front of the South Cholla provincial 
government building. 
  The local police agency, estimating over 30,000 students 
from 
throughout the nation will attend, plans to mobilize 14,000 riot 
troopers from 117 police companies to handle any emergencies. 
  Scores of illuminators and loudspeakers have been installed 
around a large podium and other places on campus in preparation 
for an inauguration rally and other celebratory functions. 
  Hundreds of placards and flags are waving at every corner in 
the campus area, trumpeting the festival organized by the 
student group. 
  Hanchongnyon has completed arrangements for lodging 50,000 
students from across the country it expects to attend while 
preparing some 200,000 lunch boxes and thousands of printed 
leaflets for the event. Those involved in printing and 
supplying food for the lunch boxes are doing a booming business 
in Kwangju. 
  Furthermore, the Choson University student organization has 
organized a corps of 1,500 volunteers to assist participants. 
  Hanchongnyon leaders said students from other parts of the 
country started to head for Kwangju early Friday morning, adding 
that all preparations for the event are progressing smoothly.

  [Text] Seoul, May 27 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition 
Democratic Party (DP) held a lawmakers' meeting at the National 
Assembly Friday and elected Rep. Sin Ki-ha as their floor leader 
for the next two years. 
  Sin, 53, a third-term representative from Kwangju, defeated 
the incumbent floor leader, Rep. Kim Tae-sik, by receiving 49 
votes to Kim's 46 with 96 DP lawmakers taking part in the vote. 
One vote was taken as an abstention. 
  Sin's election came as a surprise to many as he represents 
the non-mainstream faction while the incumbent had been endorsed 
by Chairman Yi Ki-taek, Rep. Kim Won-ki, a leading member of the 
Supreme Council, and followers of former Chairman Kim Tae-chung. 
  The party will now have to live under an awkward arrangement 
in which the mainstream leadership must carry out parliamentary 
business through a whip from a non-mainstream faction. 
  As a result of Friday's election, discord between the two 
large factions in the opposition party is expected to deepen. 
  Analysts said Sin apparently managed to demonstrate 
unexpected strength because the competition was waged more on 
personality than on factional considerations. 
  Many DP lawmakers were obviously wary of re-electing the 
already- powerful Kim Tae-sik to another two-year term, they 
said. 
  Sin is currently a member of the policy-making Supreme 
Council and chairman of the DP's Kwangju city chapter.

  [Text] Seoul, May 27 (YONHAP) -- Rep. Sin Ki-ha was elected 
the Democratic Party's [DP] floor leader at the National 
Assembly Friday in an upset over incumbent Kim Tae-sik, 
heralding further discord between the party's main and 
non-mainstream factions. 
  At a meeting of 96 DP lawmakers, Sin, 53, a third-term 
representative, defeated Kim Tae-sik and established a 
non-mainstream foothold in the party leadership dominated by 
mainstreamers. 
  Although Sin reportedly captured one of the three main party 
posts on the strength of his personality rather than factional 
considerations, his election could emerge as a major factor in 
the fight for party control at the national convention next year. 
  Kim Tae-sik had been backed for another two-year term as the 
party's whip in the unicameral legislature by Chairman Yi 
Ki-taek and followers of retired Chairman Kim Tae-chung, who is 
still a powerful force within the party. 
  With Sin's election, the top leaders of the main opposition 
party find themselves in an awkward position as they must 
conduct parliamentary business through a non-mainstreamer. 
  Reps. Kim Sang-hyon, Chong Tae-chol and other leaders of the 
non-mainstream faction, criticizing the policies of the 
mainstreamers, had been demanding that the party hold an early 
national convention and undertake reform. 
  The party's Supreme Council is its policy-making body and 
the 
floor leader simply carries out the policy crafted by the 
nine-member council. Some analysts, therefore, warn that too 
much significance should not be placed on the floor leader's 
role. 
  Nevertheless, Sin's election is an ominous sign for Chairman 
Yi Ki-taek, who has already been having difficulty controlling 
the Supreme Council, many of whose members do not see eye-to-eye 
with Yi on major issues. 
  On top of that, Yi will now have to work with a 
parliamentary 
whip who is from the opposing faction. 
  In any event, speculation abounded in the wake of the 
election Friday afternoon as to what worked in favor of Sin, 
considered a definite underdog even hours before the vote. 
  Some said several DP lawmakers must have felt it was 
undesirable for one person -- in this case, Rep. Kim Tae-sik -- 
to monopolize the floor leader's job, regarded as the most 
"glamorous" of the top party posts and as such coveted by many. 
  There must have been quite a few "sympathy votes" for Sin, 
who had not held any top posts until now even though he has been 
elected to the assembly three times, they said. 
  The mainstream faction, on the other hand, may have been 
overconfident of Kim Tae-sik's re-election since Kim Tae-chung 
followers, or the Tongyodong faction, far outnumber the 
non-mainstreamers. 
  Many Tongyodong faction members obviously crossed the line 
and voted for Sin as their leaders failed to exercise sufficient 
discipline, according to independent observers. 
  They note that Sin, who is from Kwangju, the Democratic 
Party's power base, had been working hard to win the election 
among his high school and university alumni. 
  They also point out that Sin visited Kim Tae-chung Thursday 
night and appealed to him to remain neutral in the election. 
  Whatever the reason that Sin was catapulted into the floor 
leadership, each DP faction is certain to tighten control over 
its members and work to entice more outsiders into the group. 
  As a consequence, intraparty discord and factional fighting 
will intensify as the DP marches toward next year's momentous 
national convention that will decide who is to lead the main 
opposition party.

<F P=106> [By reporter Kim Song-kol] </F>
  [Excerpts] With a grasp on power, political funds are 
bound to come in. Compared to the past, sources of political 
funding have been cut off, but Democratic Party (DP) faction 
lawmakers have not been doing that much "money grumbling." Being 
in a position of power helps fundraising considerably. 
  Looking at the spending of one newly-elected Democratic 
Liberal Party (DLP) lawmaker, he is clearly on a very tight 
budget. His monthly expenditures are about 10 million won (W). 
Because his constituency is spread out over two counties, rent 
for the offices of two local party chapters is W 1.5 million. To 
this W2.5 million is added for the salary of secretaries and 
other employees and W500 thousand in telephone bills. This means 
W4.5 million is needed for local chapter office-operating 
expenses alone. 
  Operating expenses for an office in the National Assembly 
Members' Office Building are not small either. The two phones 
provided by the National Assembly not enough, he installed one 
more phone at his own expense. The bill for this phone is about 
W300 thousand every month. He also has to have about W200 
thousand a month for treating visitors to a W3-thousand lunch in 
the Members' Office Building cafeteria. And no matter how tight 
his budget, he cannot ignore his four employees. He gives them 
each W50 thousand (per month), nominally as a lunch allowance, 
which comes to W200 thousand. 
  Here, he has no choice but to pay for office coffee, 
newspaper and magazine subscriptions, and office supplies. Since 
he has to go around his district every weekend, gasoline costs 
are no small burden. 
  When he goes down to his district, even though he meets with 
constituents he is frugal, because of his rather thin wallet. In 
the case of campaign rallies and other varies kinds of 
gatherings, he spends W100 thousand if the meeting is of 
myon-level or above and W50 thousand if it is below that, in 
order to save face. 
  In the cost of these meals too, he is determined not to go 
over W4 thousand per person. Ribs are out of the question; the 
best he can do is kimchi pot stew and cheap Korean liquor. He 
has even heard constituents say: "Is there anyone going without 
food these days? You're telling us to take the trouble to come 
out just to eat kimchi pot stew?" 
  As for occasions calling for congratulations or condolences, 
he decided not to send any flower wreaths beginning in July of 
last year, and though not much, he was able to save W3-4 
million. He expressed his condolences by visiting and showing 
his face at the home of the bereaved or with a thin envelope 
containing W30 thousand. 
  Calculated in this way, he is left with W3.5 million out of 
W10 million. This money is soon gone, however, just as food is 
soon gone from the home of a poor family with many children. 
  "I haven't seen a paycheck in some time," says this 
lawmaker, 
expressing his regret over his lack of funding, "If I just had 
W20 million a month, I could do a good job of it." 
  However, the limits of his income are obvious. All he gets 
is 
about W4.5 million a month with his National Assembly Member 
Allowance and support funds from a support association. Last 
year, W53 million in support funding came in. Calculated by the 
month, that is W4.4 million. Put the two together and it still 
does not amount to his monthly expense of W10 million. He has 
been making up the amount he lacks from his now ruined company. 
  "For opposition-party lawmakers, government officials will 
take them to dinner during times such as the periods of 
parliamentary inspection, but for ruling-party lawmakers, there 
is nothing," he said, "Nobody pays any attention to a 
newly-elected lawmaker and even support funding is low." 
  This is a straightforward example of the difficulties due to 
political funding suffered by members of the National Assembly 
in the newly changed political environment. 
  The time has now passed when bundles of money containing 
several tens of millions of won were brought to ruling-party 
lawmakers by industry and others. Furthermore, due to the sudden 
implementation of the financial realname system last year, the 
brakes have been put on dark, under-the-table dealings, for now. 
  To make matters worse, the funding which used to be sent 
down 
by the president, the head of the party, has been cut off. With 
all this, political funding placed in the hands of DLP lawmakers 
is much less than in the past. 
  Only last year when they were called to the Blue House, 
inside the bus they were riding, lawmakers exchanged 
half-hopeful remarks, "Will there be nothing this time too?" 
When there were no "royal grants" forthcoming, even as they 
passed the new year, lawmakers realized that such expectations 
were themselves pointless. 
  In the past, President Chon Tu-hwan would always send them 
W10 million; President No Tae-u, W5 million. 
  Actually, this is nothing compared to the other money former 
presidents would give them. Under the guise of hometown activity 
expenses during holidays, etc., encouragement funds was conveyed 
to lawmakers on occasion. Also, when elections were drawing 
near, full-scale campaign funding would be sent to each 
candidate. 
  Honorary president of the Hyundai Group, Chong Chu-yong, 
became the topic of conversation when, before founding the 
United People's Party, he made public the amount of political 
funding he provided the Blue House. "I provided political 
funding two times a year: at Chusok, the Harvest Moon Festival 
celebrated on August 15th of the lunar calendar, and the end of 
the year," Chong revealed at that time, saying, "During the 
Third Republic, I directly gave them W1-4 billion annually; 
during the Fifth Republic, W5-6 billion annually; during the 
Sixth Republic, W6-10 billion annually." 
  Later, this statement by Honorary President Chong was hushed 
up, but it showed a cross section of the scale of political 
funds created by the Blue House. 
  The story is widely known about how President Chon Tu-hwan, 
as he retired from office, left President No Tae-u with W55 
billion in political funds he had not used. Once after retiring, 
on an unofficial occasion, former president Chon even said, 
"President No Tae-u probably created a W500-billion political 
fund during his term in office." 
  Political funds thus created were put in envelopes and 
conveyed from time to time to members of the National Assembly, 
ministers, and Blue-House secretaries. Of course, the price was 
loyalty to the president. Thus delivered money envelopes were 
distributed on down the organization; "money-envelope politics" 
reigned supreme. 
  Only a little while after President Kim Yong-sam took office 
last year, he clarified, "I will not accept money from 
industry." There had also been a "declaration" that the 
president would not accept money from industry while President 
Roh was in office. However, President Kim's promise is different 
in that it is being kept. 
  When it was revealed recently that DLP Party President (PP) 
Kim Chong-pil collected W100 million from industry at the late 
Chong Il-kwon's funeral, President Kim stated that he was not 
accepting even relief funding from industry, and, showing 
displeasure toward PP Kim, reconfirmed the ban on accepting 
money envelopes. 
  "During the last year, depending on your perspective, we can 
mention military reform and the implementation of the real-name 
system as achievements of the new governments, but the Blue 
House's not accepting political funds should be assessed the 
most highly," said Rep. Choe Pyong-yol. 
  "Due to the moral character secured as a result of this, 
although I don't know about the new government, President Kim 
Yong-sam's support rate is unlikely to fall below 50 percent," 
Rep. Choe also said, placing great significance on this. 
  It appears that almost all lawmakers are now certain of the 
fact that the "golden egg" which used to descend from the Blue 
House has been cut off. 
  Therefore, the majority of lawmakers are feeling they have 
to 
raise their insufficient political funds themselves. 
Fortunately, in spite of this is the fact that constituents and 
voters are showing an, although not sudden, at least slow change 
of awareness. There are many instances in which they do not 
particularly complain even though they are not sent floral 
wreaths on occasions of congratulations or condolences, and, 
when only "spare change" is spent for various events, of 
overlooking this, "Lately, what money do members of the National 
Assembly have anyway?" 
  It is a fact, however, that when compared with the changes 
of 
the political environment, change in the awareness of voters is 
slow. Intending to make up this difference, lawmakers are 
working hard, each in their own way, to raise political funds. 
  Political funds are bound to come in if one holds power. 
Although sources of political funding are to a great extent 
being cut off compared to the past, DP faction lawmakers are not 
complaining that much. A position of power is a great help to 
political fund raising. 
  Restrained by those around him as a power within the DP 
faction, Rep. Kim Tok-yong is turning down the would-be 
supporters crowding in, competing to see him and offer political 
funding. Even after resigning his position as Minister of State 
for Political Affairs, as many people as ever come to see him. 
This is not unrelated to the fact that in his New Year's Press 
Conference President Kim mentioned his affection for Rep. Kim 
two times. 
  Taking a look into Rep. Kim's income, first, the annual 
legal 
limit for support association money of W150 million comes in 
with little difficulty. Last year, Rep. Kim used W100 million, 
in accordance with the law. 
  The help of his district Vice Chairmen's Group is also 
great. 
The Vice Chairmen's Group is generally made up of about 20 
municipal assemblymen and small and medium businessmen. They 
hold a meeting every month which is also a unity rally. In this 
meeting, which includes a meal, a fixed amount is collected to 
be used to support district activities. By conservative 
estimate, this amounts to about W60 million annually. 
  Rep. Kim's local party chapter is actively participating in 
the party expenses payment campaign pursued by the central party 
beginning last year. The amount collected annually reaches the 
W50-million mark. 80 percent of this returns to the local 
chapter, so here he raises W40 million. 
  Totaling all these amounts, they reach about W250 million 
annually. So he can use about W20 million a month for activity 
funds. [passage omitted] 
  Due to these circumstances, Rep. Kim can be relatively free 
in his district. He also has little reason to be anxious about 
funding. 
  Since taking his post, Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u is 
busier and does not have to time to go around his district. 
Although he occasionally had opportunities to go to his district 
after quitting his job as secretary general when his son was 
involved in the illegal college admission scandal last year, 
this is now completely impossible. However, he hears that the 
local chapter's executive office director is taking care of 
running the district using the support association membership 
fees and the contributions of the Vice Chairmen's Group. 
  Newly elected in a special election last year, Rep. Son 
Hak-kyu betrays little concern over money problems. 
  At the end of last year, Rep. Son went to visit 
"unfortunates," orphanages and homes for the elderly. Although 
not large, he was able to bring gifts that were not inferior 
either. And for last years Taeborum (a holiday on 15 January by 
the lunar calendar), he held Yut tournaments in each tong. He 
aided 15 tong with W100-200 thousand each. 
  This time, however, the money did not go out through Rep. 
Son. The support association formed in early January of last 
year and the local party chapter solved the funding problem 
themselves. This means district-activity expenses are being 
secured in sufficient amounts. Rep. Son, who has a free and easy 
character, does not even receive a report on the local chapter's 
use of funds. 
  Rep. Pak Chong-ung is also a newly elected lawmaker in last 
year's special election. As a member of the Sangdo-tong Kasin 
Group, he was the last to put on a National Assemblyman's badge. 
  Early this year, Rep. Pak opened a one day tea house to help 
the unfortunate in his district of Pusan. He had planned to use 
earnings made here for expenses incurred in making a New Year's 
visit to the Kyongnodang Orphanage, etc. Earnings were 
originally predicted to be W5 million, but upon calculating them 
after concluding the event, they were discovered to be much more 
than that. Because of this, he was able to leave a hefty gift 
with a poverty-stricken hilltop neighborhood. 
  These two newly-elected lawmakers are thus comfortably able 
to raise political funding partly because they have fresh 
images. However, it is more because they benefit from belonging 
to the DP faction. 
  DP-faction people protest that their comfortable money 
situation is not because of political funding. "It must be 
considered that we have no place to spend a lot of money because 
we have long lived the political life, penniless," said one 
DP-faction lawmaker. 
  The funding situation of Floor Leader Yi Han-tong, who 
entered the ranks of the top three in the party in reshuffle of 
party offices late last year, is not plentiful. 
  "With the upheaval last year caused by assets registration 
and the resignation of government officials, not only did 
businessmen not hand out any money, they didn't come anywhere 
near," said Floor Leader Yi when talk of political funding came 
up, stressing that the present mood is totally different than 
that of the Fifth Republic, "The past is gone." 
  Yi entrusts local chapter expenses to support-association 
fund raising and takes care of operating expenses for his 
Sodaemun office and his office in the National Assembly Members' 
Office Building himself. First of all, he was originally a 
lawyer and is a legal consultant for seven companies. He gets a 
monthly gratuity of from W500 thousand to W1 million from each 
company. He is not paid fees as a lawyer, but other lawmakers 
originally from the legal profession make an average of W10-20 
million per month in legal fees. 
  Yi also occasionally receives money to be used for "personal 
expenses" from his classmates in the legal profession, it is 
reported. After the last presidential election, Yi strongly 
expressed an intention to run in the next presidential race and 
formed a support group of his classmates from North Kyongsang 
Province High School. However, the story circulated in political 
circles for a time that, warned by the Blue House, he did an 
about face, "prostrate on the ground, motionless." 
  The forms used by mid-level bosses to scrape together 
political funds in order to manage their factions no longer 
work. The collection of political funds is a problem, but this 
is because it can be easily interpreted as the actions of one 
eyeing the next presidential race. At the present, early in 
President Kim's term of office, the mood is one in which no one 
from either the DP faction or the Democratic Justice Party (DJP) 
faction will dare to step out. 
  A lawmaker with prominent abilities at least as far as 
political funding is concerned, Kim Yun-hwan has in actuality 
ceased political fundraising recently. He hoped to be given an 
important position in the reshuffling of party offices late last 
year, but when these hopes came to nothing, he actually reduced 
his personal office space and even the number of his employees. 
He did not want to be needlessly misunderstood. 
  Rep. Yi Chun-ku, who used to profess that he was directly 
junior to former president No Tae-u, had taken money from 
President Roh and used it to manage 20 some DJP faction 
lawmakers. He has been quiet, however, without any noticeable 
activity since President Roh left office. On top of not having 
much desire for material gain to begin with, the world has 
changed and he has fallen outside the interest of the media. 
  Borrowing the words of lawmakers close to him, he only comes 
out to the Suyohoe, a gathering of lawmakers, as a leading 
assemblyman elected many times and occasionally pays for dinner; 
he is living a quiet life, they say. 
  Even so, he is doing all right for a prominent lawmaker. 
Lately, with contributions from industry having ceased and 
Blue-House funds and funds for mid-level bosses having 
disappeared due to the implementation of the real-name system, 
generally newly-elected and reelected DJP faction lawmakers are 
poking around here and there, trying to come up with political 
funding; but it is not easy. 
  One DJP faction lawmaker, who was an object of scorn last 
year during the registration of personal assets because of his 
wealth, revealed that he has received requests from four of his 
senior lawmakers to join their support associations. This is an 
example showing the difficult circumstances of some DLP faction 
lawmakers. 
  "As for opposition supporter associations, they are small 
amount, majority systems, but it is characteristic of 
ruling-party supporter associations that they are large amount, 
minority systems. It is my understanding that they came asking 
for favors because they are having difficulty securing backers 
who will support them with large amounts," he said, "I 
respectfully refused to join because I too am a member of the 
National Assembly." 
  Up until the cold winds of the anti-corruption campaign came 
blowing in last year, it usually took W25 million to manage a 
local party chapter, lawmakers explain. Lately, however, this 
has shrunk to about W10 million as the reduction of various 
expenses, including monetary gifts for funerals, weddings, etc., 
has become routine, and lawmakers agree that local chapter 
management is possible. 
  This is to say, if one only does support-association 
fundraising properly, one can get by because up to W100 million 
in support-association membership fees can be used annually. The 
Political Funding Law revised in the last special session of the 
National Assembly elevated the maximum limit on funds collected 
from support-association membership fees to W150 million. 
  It may be because PP Kim Chong-pil, leader of Republican 
Party (RP) faction lawmakers, is maintaining his position as the 
face of the party, but their financial situation is better than 
that of the DJP faction. 
  The RP faction has several persons holding party offices as 
portions allotted to it, such as Rep. Cho Pu-yong being 
Assistant Secretary General II. If one holds an important party 
office, such as Chief Secretary to the Party President, 
Spokesperson, Director of the Central Political Education 
Institute, Assistant Secretary General, or Planning Mediation 
Office director, one's funding situation improves conspicuously. 
Support associations become active and, depending on individual 
ability, sources of funding develop. 
  Of the ten local chapter chief organizer positions announced 
in early March, deputy spokesperson Cho Yong-chik brushed aside 
DP faction people to occupy the post in the Songpa-ul chapter. 
Although it is said that Cho was chosen this time out of 
recognition for his contributions as candidate spokesperson in 
the last presidential election, there is no mistaking that the 
prestige of Kim Chong-pil also influenced the decision to a 
certain extent. 
  Cho had not asked people around him for money envelopes. 
Now, 
however, with the justification resulting from his leaving 
behind the "indoors" of a nationwide constituency to entered the 
"field" of a local constituency, he plans to sound out the 
intentions of his classmates and friends. It is his thinking 
that, inasmuch as his political position is not shrinking, it is 
not too much to expect the support of those around him. 
  Last year, DLP lawmakers received no political funding from 
the Blue House and almost no support from the central party 
either. Just once, in a meeting of members of the National 
Assembly and local chapter chairmen held before the summer 
season's hometown activities, they divided a total of W3 
million. Local-chapter chairmen not active members of the 
National Assembly received W2 million more at Chusok last year. 
This is because the funding situation is not good in the central 
party either. 
  The DLP's 1993 income was approximately W36.7 billion. This 
is about one-third of its 1992 election-year income of W96.5 
billion. As these are the figures reported to the Central 
Election Management Committee, it appears the actual difference 
will be much greater. 
  Contrarily, with 1993 expenditures of W94.3 billion, the DLP 
recorded a surplus of W2.2 billion. We see this sort of result 
because, although it had high expenditures, its income was 
greater. Last year, however, with expenditures on the scale of 
W40.4 billion, it had a deficit of W3.7 billion. 
  Having deposited in a bank the over W7 million in proceeds 
from the sale of its Karak-tong training institute last year, 
the DLP made up its deficit with the resulting interest income. 
DLP officials are not at ease about this, however, since it 
appears the tax on the sale of the training institute will 
amount to W30 billion. Details of last year's expenditures: 

  -  operating costs including labor costs, W23.5 billion; 
  -  organizational-activity costs, W8.6 billion; 
  -  policy costs, 
W7.5 billion; and 
  -  publicity costs, W700 million. 

  Paid employees of the DLP executive office are worried, not 
knowing when the may lose their jobs under the slogan, getting 
rid of the flab. Although party officials have said there would 
be no personnel reductions in the current reorganization of the 
executive office, this has not completely dissipated their 
worries. 
  At present, the number of paid employees is about 780: over 
three hundred for the central party, provincial, and municipal 
branch offices and 474 local-chapter chief secretaries and 
organization department chiefs. The party cut back 799 persons 
last March. And beginning last year, there is a continuous two 
year pay freeze in effect. 
  The funding sources needed for operating the DLP are 
national 
grants, designated trust funds, party membership fees, and 
party-support association support funds. 
  A national grant is money from the national budget for 
aiding 
political party activities. As provided by the Political Funding 
Law, the state divides among political parties a sum calculated 
at W600 per voter. 
  In the recent special session of the National Assembly, this 
was revised and raised to W800 per person. Last year, the DLP 
received W8.48 billion in national grants. That is close to half 
of the entire W17.4 billion worth of national grants given. 
  The term designated trust fund refers to a donation 
presented 
by a contributor to the CEMC after designating a specific 
political party. Of course, the CEMC conveys this trust fund to 
the appropriate political party in regular periods. 
  Last year, designated trust funds amounted to W19.9 billion. 
Inasmuch as the entire amount is to be given to the DLP, it is 
an important source of DLP funding. The DLP has commissioned a 
45-person finance committee. These finance committee members 
make designated deposits. During the parliamentary inspections, 
the opposition demanded that the list of designated depositors 
be made public, but this was not realized due to the opposition 
of the DLP. 
  There was also bickering between the ruling party and 
opposition over these designated trust funds in the six-man 
negotiations for the revision of politics-related laws. Entering 
the new year, these drew the extraordinary attention of the 
political world. Giving reasons such as that there could be 
favors given as the price of donation, the DP argued that 
specific political parties should not be designated, rather, 
that moneys should be distributed according to the number of 
seats a party controls and the percentage of the vote it 
obtains. The DLP violently opposed this, however. Their thinking 
was that it was only right that the will of the person or 
corporation donating the political funds be respected. Moreover, 
it even argued that these should not pass through the CEMC, but 
should be donated directly to the political parties. 
  Ultimately, negotiations concluded in the maintenance of the 
method now in effect, as was argued by the DLP. The CEMC's 
revision proposal, that 25 percent of designated trust funds be 
distributed to all political parties according to the number of 
seats and percentage of the vote they control and 75 percent be 
given to the party designated by the contributor, was not 
adopted either. After the negotiations were over, Floor Leader 
Yi Han-tong said, "These were the excessive demands of the 
opposition, which hide an ulterior motive of trying to 
obliterate the ruling party." This shows the situation of the 
DLP, which considers designated trust funds important. Besides 
this, party-membership fees and party-support association 
support funds amounted to W8.2 billion. 
  With the increased difficulty of the financial management of 
the party, expense accounts for party officials are less than 
expected. Beginning with the W20 million PP Kim Chong-pil 
receives every month, the secretary general gets W4.5 million; 
policy-committee chairman, W9 million; National Assembly floor 
leader, W18 million. The reason the expense accounts are not 
just given in W10-million increments is that party expenses this 
year were cut 10 percent across the board. 
  In the case of the secretary general, last year when Choe 
Hyong-u held the office, he cut his own portion, making it less 
than that of the other two of the three main party offices. 
However, the secretary general of the ruling party holds power 
said to match that of the ten ministers, such as having control 
of personnel and financial actions within the party, so the 
expense account provided by the party cannot be said to be his 
only source of funding. 
  The floor leader within the National Assembly has to deal 
with both ruling and opposition-party lawmakers, and so takes 
special care. He is also chairman of the House Steering 
Committee, and therefore can use an expense account of over W25 
million, which includes the over-W7-million expense account of 
the Steering Committee Chairman. 
  Of the three main offices, that of Policy Committee Chairman 
is the position with the most heartache over the expense-account 
issue. In the past, policy issues were completely dumped in the 
lap of the administration; this has resulted in relatively poor 
treatment for the Policy Committee Chairman. 
  The Policy Committee Chairman participates in various 
meetings being held practically every day. Although expenses 
associated with these meetings are not that great, dinner 
expenses are a problem. Combined dinner-meetings held in a 
restaurants are okay. Even though there be a fairly large number 
of participants, W200-300 thousand is enough to cover it. He can 
put in a claim for the expenses to the party administrative 
office, and no one says anything about it. 
  However, most meeting agenda's are hurriedly decided upon, 
so 
it is common for reservations to be made with a hotel 
restaurant. Dinning expenses are usually W30 thousand for lunch 
and W50 thousand for dinner. If a few rounds of drinks are added 
to this, no one will readily want to pay for it. This is because 
the cost could easily go over W1 million if to the expenses of 
the over ten participants are added those of their attendants,. 
  In this case, the Policy Committee Chairman has to help pay 
for it. Once may be okay, but if this happens frequently, there 
is no way he can handle it with only his expense account. "In 
short, I'm no different than a beggar," said Policy Committee 
Chairman Yi Ki-taek of the expense account. 
  Thus, to produce correct, realistic policy, he needs to 
visit 
hilltop neighborhoods, farming villages, factories, and remote 
islands, but this is impossible with the expense account 
allotted him by the party. In most instances, due to various 
circumstances, such activities end in sitting down to the table 
to listen to the opinions of the government or related 
organizations. 
  Of senior officials, it is the minister of state for 
political affairs who has the largest expense accounts for 
activities, etc. Last year, he received about W22 million, but 
this year it almost doubled. Together with his 
information-expense allowance, it reached over W32 million. This 
money all comes out of the administration's budget. This is out 
of concern for the wide range of people with whom the minister 
of state for political affairs has to deal: ruling and 
opposition-party lawmakers, government bureaucrats, and even 
opposition figures not presently holding office. 
  After taking his post late last year, Minister of State for 
Political Affairs So Chong-won even bought lunch for opposition 
reporters. These official activity expenses are not ample enough 
to be used for activities in their own constituencies, say these 
senior officials. Instead, they are aided in securing funding 
sources resulting from personal connections, they say. 
  Ordinary lawmakers raise official and unofficial political 
funds through their own career and school connections. Lawmakers 
who originally held high-level positions in former 
administrations use connections made through their past 
government posts to overcome difficult, political-funding 
circumstances. 
  Rep. An Mu-hyok, who had been commissioner of the National 
Tax Administration and director of the Agency for National 
Security Planning, feels no great difficulty in political 
funding. With a nationwide constituency, Rep. An runs the Korea 
Development Research Institute Hanguk Kaebal Yongukwon, and 
holds a monthly seminar sponsored by this institute. Expenses 
are sufficiently covered by the W10-thousand fee paid by each of 
the participants. 14 employees work at the research institute, 
and it even publishes a quarterly magazine called, Korean 
Development. 
  The research institute also has 22 directors. Of these 
directors, nine contribute from W500 thousand to W2 million 
every month. Many of the seminar participants and directors are 
either persons who formed connections with An while he held his 
past offices or are businessmen originally from the North who 
support conservative policy. 
  In the same way, Rep. Kang Kyong-sik, who long lived the 
life 
of a bureaucrat at the Economic Planning Board and was Finance 
Vice Minister and Chief Presidential Secretary, runs the 
National Management Strategy Research Center. 
  Lawmakers Ho Sam-su, Ho Hwa-pyong, and Yi Sang-chae, who 
boasted enormous power during the early 5th Republic, are also 
reported to have their own solid financial supporters. 
  Rep. Choe Pyong-yol too, who had been both Information and 
Labor minister, feels no difficulty in political funding due to 
his relationships formed up to now with relevant figures in 
academic circles. It is also said that those lawmakers with 
nationwide constituencies who show the potential for someday 
being selected to head a government ministry have no problems 
getting political funding. 
  Regardless of their faction, lawmakers having special 
relationships with the financial world seem to have money to 
spare. 
  Belonging to this group are Rep. Kim Chae-kyom, originally 
from the Ssang Yong Group and presently acting as group counsel, 
Rep. So Chong-hwa, who was Home Affairs Minister and is the 
father-in-law of the Korea Explosives Group's C.E.O, Rep. Na 
Ung-pae, who was Economic Planning Board Director, Finance 
Minister, and president of Haetae and Korea Tire, and Kang 
Sin-cho, who was president of Tongyang Investment Trust. 
  Because they solve their own political-funding problems, 
lawmakers with large assets do not worry over political 
fundraising. These wealthy men have considered the formation of 
support associations undesirable: they do not bring in much 
money anyway and result in annoying civil appeals. However, as 
the legal number of local-chapter support association members 
was increased from two hundred to three hundred with the recent 
revision of the Political Funding Law, they are now hastening 
the formation of support associations for strengthening 
localchapter organization. 
  "We formed a support association last year, but it only 
brought inW10 million in support funds. This is actually a loss 
when you think of the expenses incurred in recruiting people," 
says one wealthy lawmaker who in the private-assets registration 
ended up in the ranks of the richest in the party. "But I will 
continue so local chapter members will understand that this 
takes money," he says. 
  An example of a peculiar case is former television 
personality Rep. Yi Sun-chae. Completely depending on his 
support association of over twenty very close friends, he puts 
his "face" to good advantage, using his advertisement-modeling 
fees for his political funds. Rep. Yi, receiving W100 million in 
advertisement-modeling fees this year from W Publishing Company 
[as published], acquired the "live rounds" he needs for a year's 
political battles. 
  Rep. Pak Pom-chin, was the first ruling-party lawmaker to 
raise political funding by making use of newspaper advertising, 
Last year he received over W120 million from over 2600 people. 
Rare for a ruling-party lawmaker, he made public his expense 
details. It was revealed that he used W13 million a month, 
including over W1.2 million for congratulations and condolence 
costs. 
  Conducting parliamentary activities even while directly 
farming, Rep. Pak Kyong-su's average monthly expenses, even 
though a ruling-party lawmaker, are only a little over W1.5 
million. For weddings, funerals, etc., he sends telegrams of 
congratulations or condolence, without sending any cash or 
presents. As one part of the Farm-Village Bachelors Marriage 
Campaign he is conducting, when he sponsors unmarried, Korean 
women living in China for immigration to Korea, he receives in 
advance his annual pay as an Assemblyman and uses it to welcome 
them. 
  In the recent special session of the National Assembly, both 
the ruling party and the opposition passed the Public Election 
and Election-Irregularities Prevention Law. According to this 
law, in the event of excessive campaign spending as in the past, 
the election of the guilty party will be invalidated and he or 
she will be restricted from running for public office for up to 
a maximum of ten years, which could in fact end his or her 
political career. 
  Of course, enforcement of the law remains an issue, but it 
appears the "30-wins-20-losses" extremes of corruption seen in 
the last election will disappear. 
  However, just because election campaign expenses have been 
severely restricted does not mean political funding worries have 
vanished. Many lawmakers worry that everyday expenses will be 
greater than those at election time. 
  They say this is because if they have to recruit unpaid 
volunteers for most of their campaign workers, it will take a 
tremendous amount of effort. 
  Also, if, as in the past, they wait until election day draws 
near to appeal to voters for their votes, it is obvious that 
they will be thrust aside by political hopefuls who have been 
hitting the pavement in their districts. Therefore, no matter 
what, they have to go down to their districts one or more times 
a week, they say. 
  In these circumstances, even spokesperson Ha Sun-bong, whose 
face is often seen in the media, unhesitatingly goes down to his 
Chinju, South Kyongsang Province district on weekends as long is 
there is no special function going on. On Saturday morning, his 
pocket contains W1 million, but by Sunday evening, only two or 
three thousand-won bills are rolling around in it.

  [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean economy 
is picking up faster than expected, with the Gross National 
Product (GNP) growing 8.8 percent in January-March, the Bank of 
Korea [BOK] said Friday. 
  The healthy nature of the growth led by the manufacturing 
industry and facility investment, compared with the overheating 
in the construction sector and consumption in the 1980s and 
early 1990s, brightens economic prospects even more, BOK 
officials said after studying the tentative estimate. 
  Accordingly, the central bank raised its forecast for this 
year's economic growth to above 7 percent from last December's 
6.3 percent, but voiced fears of economic overheating due to 
shaky prices and increasing consumption. 
  GNP was 51.48 trillion won in terms of 1990 constant prices 
(63. 8 billion U.S. dollars in current exchange rate) in the 
first quarter of the year, up 8.8 percent from 47.43 trillion 
won a year earlier. 
  The growth is the highest since 10.7 percent in April-June 
1991 while the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) also soared 9.1 
percent during this period, again the most since the second 
quarter of 1991. 
  Facility investment and a recovery in the manufacturing 
sector were major contributors to the better-than-expected 
economic growth in the first months of the year. 
  Due to high hopes of an economic rebound, facility 
investment 
surged 20.2 percent, the highest since 23.7 percent in 
January-March 1988, thanks to 21.3-percent growth solely in 
machinery. 
  Manufacturing grew 9.8 percent, the most since 11.5 percent 
in the winter of 1991, with the light industry increasing 1.2 
percent for the first time since spring 1992 and the heavy and 
chemical industry rising 13.2 percent. 
  Electric, gas, and water works rose 16.1 percent: service, 
10.3 percent, and construction, 8.2 percent. Agriculture and 
forestry, which decreased 6.8 percent last winter, rebounded 
with 4.8-percent growth. Commodity and service exports 
increased 8.9 percent. 
  External conditions look good, with an improved world 
economy 
and a strong yen, and facility investment at home should be 
active, BOK Governor Kim Myong-ho said. 
  Should this trend continue, the domestic economy may well 
rise above 7 percent this year, he said. 
  But there are signs of economic overheating. 
  Consumption in January-March hit 3.3 percent and the 
current- 
account deficit surged four times to 2.52 billion U.S. dollars 
from a year earlier with imports on the rise. 
  Household consumption also hit 6.9 percent, the highest 
since 
7. 1 percent in April-June 1992.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
will hold talks on insurance in Tokyo on June 1 and 2 under the 
resumed "framework" trade talks, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii 
said Friday. 
  But Fujii told a news conference after a morning cabinet 
meeting that he has not heard about financial services in 
denying a reported U.S. intention to begin talks in that area 
together with insurance. 
  The Finance Ministry is in charge of negotiations for 
insurance and other financial areas. 
  On the insurance, Fujii suggested that Japan would not offer 
any new commitments. "We must pin our utmost efforts to 
realizing the positive steps" included in the March 
market-opening package, he said. 
  The package promises deregulation and simpler licensing in 
Japan's insurance business. 
  The two nations agreed in informal talks earlier this week 
to 
reopen bilateral trade talks that have been ruptured since 
February. 
  The breakthrough came on consensus over creating both 
qualitative and quantitative yardsticks instead of imposing 
numerical targets to assess Japan's market access on each of the 
negotiation sectors. 
  The insurance business is one of the three priority areas 
alone with automobile and auto parts and government procurement 
of telecommunications and medical equipment. 
  Turning to domestic issues, Fujii said a "clue" for solving 
bad-loan problems was observed at the previous day's release of 
the fiscal 1993 business results by major commercial banks. 
  Japan's 11 major commercial banks said they wrote off some 2 
trillion yen worth of domestic bad loans, more than double the 
amount of the previous year. 
  The total amount of bad loans -- with bankrupt borrowers or 
on which no interest has been paid for six months or more -- 
inched up to some 9 trillion yen, and most bank officials said 
the emergence of new nonperforming loans has peaked. 
  Fujii said he welcomes the banks' efforts to reduce the 
amount of bad loans. 
  Referring to the consumer price index reported at the 
cabinet 
meeting, the finance minister said, "I got the impresssion that 
prices remain low both in Tokyo and nationwide." 
  The Management and Coordination Agency reported that May 
consumer prices in Tokyo rose 0.6 percent from the year before 
but the rate of gain shrank 0.2 percentage points from the 
previous month, with the consumer price index (CPI) standing at 
107.5 on a 1990 basis of 100. 
  Prices nationwide in April rose 0.8 percent from a year 
earlier and gained 0.2 percent from March, with the CPI standing 
at 107.3.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan on Friday [27 May] 
hailed the U.S. decision to extend China's most-favored-nation 
(MFN) trade status as a favorable development to the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  "Japan welcomes the latest decision as it believes 
U.S.-China 
relations are very important to the Asia-Pacific region," Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton, in a major shift in his China 
policy, announced Thursday he has decided to extend China's MFN 
status despite continuing "serious human rights abuses" in China. 
  The top Japanese Goverment spokesman said Washington has 
informed Tokyo in advance of its decision to extend China's MFN 
status through diplomatic channels. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said at a separate news 
conference that he welcomes the U.S. decision. 
  He said Japan will continues to press China to improve its 
human rights record.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata flatly denied press reports Thursday [26 May] that 
he promised the United States last month to implement continuous 
income tax cuts over a three-year period. 
  "I couldn't have easily given such a promise at the time, as 
it would have had to be followed through by the incoming 
government. Common sense rules out such an idea," Hata said. 
  "Such expectations were voiced but how could I give such a 
promise," he added. 
  In its Thursday evening issue, the Japanese business daily 
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN quoted a high-ranking U.S. Government 
official as saying Hata promised the permanent tax cuts to U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor when they met at the signing 
ceremony for the Uruguay Round of multilateral world trade talks 
in Marrakesh, Morocco, in April. 
  Hata, then still foreign minister under Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, reportedly agreed to a three-year lag between 
the implementation of income tax cuts and the introduction of 
new taxes to boost Japan's economy. 
  The daily also reported that Washington takes the alleged 
Hata promise as a premise for resumption of the stalled 
framework talks on bilateral trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of the 
largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and U.S. 
Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale agreed Friday [27 May] that 
persistent negotiations with North Korea are necessary to deal 
with Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms development, LDP 
officials said. 
  Kono, meeting with Mondale at LDP headquarters in Tokyo, 
said 
he hopes the issue will be resolved through dialogue involving 
China, Japan, South Korea and the United States, the officials 
said. 
  "Our country is within the range of North Korean missiles, 
and people of North Korean origin are also living here. We 
should not react eccentrically," Kono was quoted as saying of 
speculation that Pyongyang would attack Japan at any moment. 
  Mondale said the basic U.S. stance is to continue talking 
with North Korea, maintaining close contact with Japan and 
negotiating with South Korea and the United Nations, according 
to the officials. 
  They met for the second time at Mondale's request, following 
a meeting last October, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
hinted at legislation Thursday [26 May] to prepare for possible 
United Nations sanctions against North Korea in connection with 
Pyongyang's suspected nuclear weapons development. 
  "Japan would, as a matter of course, do what it can in 
response to (UN) sanctions if there is anything it cannot do 
because of lack of legislation," Hata said in answering 
questions before the House of Representatives Budget Committee. 
  The remarks referred to the possibility of emergency 
legislation to enable Japan to participate in possible sanctions 
against Pyongyang, which are likely to include blocking of sea 
routes. 
  Hata ruled out the possibility that Tokyo may resort to 
force, saying Japan will act within the framework of its 
war-renouncing constitution in a case of collective security 
under the UN banner. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told the same Diet committee 
session that it is impossible to give a wholesale answer on how 
Japan would deal with a collective security case, saying a 
variety of situations could arise, such as calls for Japan to 
join UN peacekeeping operations or future UN forces.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Food Agency said Friday 
[27 May] it will sell about 50,000 tons of Australian-produced 
rice throughout Japan in July. 
  The sale of the 1994-crop rice is intended to increase 
Japan's rice supplies and reduce market prices in order to 
facilitate auctions of Japanese-produced rice for free marketing 
outside government channels, agency officials said. The 
auctions are to be resumed in July. 
  For the same purpose, the agency will also sell a total of 
100,000 tons of Japanese-produced rice from its emergency rice 
stockpile in July and August, the officials said. 
  The agency earlier announced a plan to supply 150,000 tons 
of 
Japanese-produced rice in each of the two months, and the total 
supply of such rice in the period is now expected to amount to 
400,000 tons. 
  The domestic rice market is heating up following the 1993 
rice crop failure that forced Japan to resort to emergency 
imports. 
  The government controls production and marketing of most 
Japanese-produced rice, but 40 percent is marketed freely 
outside government channels. 
  Medium-grain Australian rice is similar to Japanese rice and 
is likely to be popular among Japanese consumers, the officials 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Diet testimony by former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on his own controversial 
financial dealings seems unavoidable as expected testimony by 
his former aide is unlikely to disperse all suspicions, 
political sources said Thursday [26 May]. 
  The ruling coalition finally agreed Thursday to opposition 
demands that Hosokawa's former aide, Masatoshi Miyama, be 
summoned to the House of Representatives Budget Committee. 
  Miyama's Diet testimony is likely to take place in the 
middle 
of June after the state budget for fiscal 1994 passes the lower 
house, the sources said. 
  Hosokawa is suspected of involvement in dubious financial 
deals, including a 100 million yen loan from scandal-tainted 
Sagawa Kyubin business group in 1982 and the purchase of shares 
in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986. 
  As Hosokawa's former top secretary, Miyama likely handled 
most of the management of the former premier's personal funds 
but he could find it difficult to clarify all the allegations in 
a way that will satisfy questioners, the sources said. 
  Many leaders of ruling coalition parties say Hosokawa will 
probably have to testify himself to clear up suspicions, the 
sources said. 
  Hosokawa was forced to quit the premiership in April due to 
a 
stalemate in Diet deliberations on the state budget, chiefly 
caused by charges he might have been involved in the dubious 
transactions. 
  Hosokawa has said he properly paid back the 100 million yen 
loan to the Sagawa group by 1991, and denied he personally 
touched the NTT stock purchase. 
  But the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and other opposition 
parties suspect Hosokawa used the Sagawa money as undeclared 
political donations for his successful gubernatorial election 
campaign in Kumamoto Prefecture on Kyushu in western Japan. 
  A financial consultant who used to help Hosokawa told a news 
conference in the Diet that the former premier bought the shares 
himself. 
  The LDP, as the political party with the largest number of 
lower house members, has held the fiscal 1994 budget hostage for 
the past several months to push its demands for a full inquiry. 
  Due to an agreement on Miyama's testimony at a directors' 
meeting of the budget committee, however, the LDP proposed 
completing all discussions on the state budget in both chambers 
before the current Diet session ends on June 29, Diet sources 
said. 
  In lieu of the full budget, the government had to push 
through two stopgap budgets to cover the first three months of 
fiscal 1994 which started on April 1.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Ten opposition members in 
the Diet met Thursday [26 May] in an effort to form an 
interparty political group in early June aimed at establishing a 
liberal government. 
  Among the 10 legislators were Katsuhiko Shirakawa, a House 
of 
Representatives member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
the biggest opposition party, and Seiichi Kaneta, also a lower 
house member of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) 
[SDPJ], the No. 2 opposition group. 
  The participants said they expect the new group to help 
establish a liberal government. They criticized the ruling 
coalition for practicing "totalitarian, high-handed way of 
management." 
  Meanwhile, the ruling coalition said they have agreed to 
allow two SDPJ members and two former members of the Japan New 
Party (JNP) to take part in its policy forum teams. The JNP led 
by former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is one of the ruling 
parties. 
  The four are Masanori Goto and Churyo Morii both of the 
SDPJ, 
and Seiji Maehara and Yukio Edano, who bolted from the JNP. 
  They will join in the capacity of individuals, coalition 
officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the two principal 
opposition forces, are unlikely to forge a grand coalition, the 
leader of a minor political party predicted Friday [27 May]. 
  "We don't expect the LDP and the SDP to get together and 
form 
a new government," Michihiko Kano of New Party Mirai said in a 
lecture. 
  Kano, who bolted the LDP with four others and launched the 
new conservative party in April, reasoned that it is "unnatural" 
for those with a different political philosophy to form a 
coalition. 
  A coalition between the LDP and the SDP, long archrivals 
under the LDP rule that ended last summer, would "be against the 
principle of political reform," said Kano, a former director 
general of the Management and Coordination Agency. 
  Noting the several months that will follow the passage of 
the 
fiscal 1994 national budget will be a critical stage for Japan's 
politics, he urged the formation of a "powerful" government to 
institute political, economic and administrative reforms toward 
the 21st century. 
  Mirai has generally supported Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
from outside the cabinet.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Japanese cabinet Friday 
[27 May] approved the itinerary for Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko's June 10-26 visit to the United States. 
  The ambitious schedule will take the imperial couple to 11 
cities for visits with President Bill Clinton, UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and two former presidents, among 
other people. 
  The trip will also include visits to a number of historical, 
cultural and natural sites but notably will exclude a visit to 
Pearl Harbor, the site of Japan's surprise attack on U.S. forces 
there December 7, 1941. 
  The government dropped plans last week to visit the USS 
Arizona National Memorial at Pearl Harbor under pressure from 
conservative scholars and critics, who fear the emperor would be 
expected to give an apology for the attack that pulled the U.S. 
into World War II. 
  Instead, the imperial couple is scheduled to visit the Punch 
Bowl National Cemetery to lay a wreath in memory of the dead of 
the war in the Pacific. 
  The emperor and empress will embark on their trip June 10 
for 
Atlanta where they will meet former U.S. President Jimmy Carter 
and the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., Coretta Scott King. 
  During a three-day stay in Washington, the imperial couple 
will be hosted as state guests by the Clintons, will attend a 
concert and reception at the Kennedy Center, and visit the 
Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. 
  Their schedule also includes a visit to the United Nations, 
a 
major league baseball game in St. Louis, a visit to the Rockies 
and a meeting with former U.S. President Ronald Reagan before 
going to Honolulu on June 10. 
  In 1960, then Crown Prince Akihito visited Pearl Harbor. The 
late Emperor Hirohito traveled to the island of Hawaii in 1975 
as part of his American tour but did not go to Pearl Harbor. 
  The imperial couple is scheduled to return to Japan on June 
26. 
  The emperor's entourage will include former Prime Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa. The entire trip will cost some 190 million yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan maintained its 
position as the world's top creditor nation for the third 
straight year in 1993, with its net overseas assets rising 18.9 
percent to a record 610.8 billion dollars, a government report 
released Friday [27 May] said. 
  The report, presented by Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii to 
the cabinet, appears certain to add fuel to calls from other 
Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations for action to trim 
Japan's trade surpluses ahead of the G-7 summit scheduled for 
July in Naples. 
  The latest reporting year was the 12th straight year in 
which 
Japan's net overseas assets -- overseas assets minus foreign 
liabilities -- increased from the year-earlier level. 
  Gross overseas assets rose 7.2 percent to 2,180.8 billion 
dollars, of which more than 80 percent were held in the private 
sector in the form of overseas lending, factory, stock and 
property. 
  The growth in gross assets was fanned by a whopping 6.2 
percent jump in assets held in stocks and bonds which Japanese 
investors purchased for long-term investment or a holding period 
of more than one year. 
  Private direct foreign investment or purchases of real 
estate 
and construction of factories climbed 4.7 percent to 259.7 
billion dollars, reflecting an unabated trend among Japanese 
firms to shift production abroad. 
  In the public sector, foreign lending, such as Official 
Development Assistance (ODA), increased 17.4 percent to 103.6 
billion dollars. 
  By maturity, long-term assets rose 7.4 percent to 1,412.9 
billion dollars, while short-term assets grew 6.7 percent to 
767.9 billion dollars. 
  Total liabilities edged up 3.2 percent to 1.57 trillion 
dollars for the first increase in two years as foreign investors 
boosted purchases of Japanese securities and Japanese firms 
increased loans in foreign currencies. 
  According to the latest data available, Germany and Britain 
are the only other net creditor nations among the G-7 nations. 
Canada, France, Italy and the United States are all debtor 
nations. 
  Germany had net foreign assets of 257.6 billion dollars at 
the end of June 1993, while Britain's net foreign assets totaled 
521.3 billion dollars at the end of 1992.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa called Friday [27 May] for further economic 
deregulation to give foreign firms greater access to Japanese 
markets. 
  Kakizawa told a meeting of the government's task force for 
administrative reforms held at the official residence of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata that Japan should promote deregulation in 
response to growing calls from overseas. 
  He noted that Japan and the United States have agreed to 
drop 
discussions on so-called "numerical targets" for Japanese 
imports of American products in resumed negotiations on a new 
framework for bilateral trade. 
  Kakizawa said deregulation should also be implemented in the 
expanding information and communications industry to promote 
competition on the market. 
  He said Cable News Network of the U.S. and the British 
Broadcasting Corp. are building up their footholds in Asia and 
Japan should join them in the race.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- A tax reform subcommittee of 
the ruling coalition is expected to keep the maximum tax rate on 
personal income unchanged at 65 percent in working out tax cut 
plans to take effect in 1995, council officials said Thursday 
[26 May]. 
  Under the plan, the income tax rate would be 50 percent and 
the residential tax rate would be 15 percent, the officials said. 
  The plan would also continue the present progressive tax 
system of levying the income tax in five stages of between 10 
and 50 percent and the residential tax in three stages of 
between 5 and 15 percent. 
  The panel's discussions will now focus on a possible raise 
in 
the minimum taxable income to lighten the tax burden for people 
with low-incomes and an expansion of an income bracket to which 
a tax rate of 10-20 percent would apply, the officials said. 
  The latter proposal would reduce the tax burden for 
taxpayers 
with annual incomes of between 7 million and 12 million yen. 
  The government's tax commission last November proposed that 
the maximum tax rate on personal income be cut to 50 percent 
from the present 65 percent. 
  The proposal was widely criticized as benefiting the rich. 
  The 65 percent tax rate currently applies to taxable income 
of more than 20 million yen, after various deductions.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry is 
inclined to adopt income tax cuts three years before an 
offsetting consumption tax hike in line with a U.S. demand, a 
ministry report suggested Friday [27 May]. 
  The report, submitted to the government's advisory panel, 
estimates net revenues in fiscal 2000, after the 6.2 trillion 
yen tax cuts are extended and the current 3 percent consumption 
tax is hiked to 7 percent to 10 percent from April 1997. 
  This represents a three-year lag until a future tax raise 
from already implemented tax cuts, which include 5.5 trillion 
yen in income and resident taxes, that are limited to the 
current fiscal year. 
  The ministry also called for net revenue increases beyond a 
consumption tax increase to 6 percent to cover the tax cuts, in 
order to fund heavier welfare burdens amid a graying society. 
  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen recently said the 
United States would endorse Japan's plan to link tax cuts with 
offsetting indirect tax hikes if the two measures are separated 
by at least three years. 
  The report will be a key reference for the tax commission, 
an 
advisory panel to the prime minister. It is scheduled to issue 
its proposals by the end of June, by which time Japan promised 
in its March market-open package to detail full-fledged tax 
reform. 
  Based on the panel's proposals, the government and the 
ruling 
coalition parties are to decide on reform, but uncertainties 
remain amid the yet-fluid political situation for the coalition 
parties holding minority Diet seats. 
  The ministry's report also poses various problems for the 
panel to use without further reviewing. The tax forum is to 
draft alternatives with concrete figures for presentation at 
regional hearings in early June. 
  The estimates exclude possible effects from fiscal and 
administrative reform and expected "natural" tax revenue 
increases despite the panel's intent to factor them into its 
alternatives. 
  Based on a 7 percent consumption tax, the report estimates a 
net tax revenue increase of 2 trillion yen in fiscal 2000. 
However, a revenue shortfall of 5.3 trillion yen results when 
1.8 trillion yen in funds to repay "bridge" bonds and 5.5 
trillion yen in increased welfare spending are included. 
  The "bridge" bonds are debts to finance the advance tax 
cuts, 
and the ministry wants to clear them in 10 years. Welfare 
spending is based on a 21st century welfare vision issued in 
March by an advisory panel to the Health and Welfare Ministry. 
  A plan proposed in February by then Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa would have replaced the 3 percent consumption tax with 
a 7 percent "national welfare" tax. 
  The ministry sees a revenue surplus only with the 10 percent 
model, which would generate 700 billion yen. 
  Although not included in the models, the report estimates a 
"natural" increase in tax revenues of 2.8 trillion yen to 3.0 
trillion yen based on a revenue elasticity rate of 1.1 and a 
nominal economic growth rate of 5 percent. 
  The ministry report noted that the government must secure 
funds for a planned increase in the amount of the 10-year, 430 
trillion yen plan in public works spending started in fiscal 
1991. Japan also pledged in its March package to decide on the 
boost by the end of June.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- A Ministry of Finance panel 
will propose the introduction of an indirect tax aimed 
specifically at preserving the environment, ministry sources 
said Friday [27 May]. 
  The proposal by a working group of the Institute of Fiscal 
and Monetary Policy, a think tank affiliated with the Finance 
Ministry, will be part of a package of recommendations on how to 
create a more environmentally friendly society through fiscal 
and monetary policy. 
  In a final report on the theme, to be issued in late June, 
the group will also urge the government and private firms to be 
more concerned with environmental conservation in their 
activities. 
  The proposed indirect environment tax would be added to the 
prices of manufactured goods, with the tax ratio set depending 
on the amounts of energy used to make the products. 
  The group will also recommend that private firms disclose 
data relating to their activities both benign and harmful to the 
environment, such as the amount of industrial waste generated 
and the amount of investment made for ecology preservation. 
  It will also ask the government as well as private banks to 
lend more to ecology-protecting projects and less to those 
focused only on economic interests. 
  Other ideas to be included in the report are the 
introduction 
of garbage-collecting fees and a review of the current farming 
methods that depend heavily on chemicals.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japanese farmers demanded 
more freedom in producing and marketing their rice in a 
three-week series of hearings held nationwide by a government 
advisory council, government officials said Thursday [26 May]. 
  The Agricultural Administration Council wound up the 
hearings 
Thursday with a session in Miyazaki, southern Japan. 
  The hearings were intended to solicit views of farmers and 
consumers to help the council work out plans for agricultural 
reforms, following Japan's agreement last December at the 
Uruguay Round of global trade talks to partially open its rice 
market. 
  Most participating farmers supported in principle the 
continuation of the nation's food control system, under which 
the government controls production and distribution of rice, the 
officials said. 
  But farmers sought greater freedom in allotting their rice 
stocks for free distribution. Currently, the government allows 
40 percent of the nation's rice harvest to be freely marketed 
outside government channels by farmers' groups and rice dealers. 
  Most rice farmers and consumers also said rice should be 
stockpiled to deal with a poor rice crop, like the 1993 crop 
failure that forced Japan to resort to emergency rice imports. 
  Some said 1.5 million to 2 million tons of rice should be 
stockpiled, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japan's total rice acreage 
is likely to increase by about 80,000 hectares from last year to 
roughly 2.20 million hectares in 1994, reflecting revived 
enthusiasm among farmers to grow rice, the agriculture ministry 
said Thursday [26 May]. 
  The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said 
farmers 
turned enthusiastic after typhoons helped make for a poor 
harvest last year, leading the government to begin emergency 
rice imports. 
  According to a report by the Central Union of Agricultural 
Cooperatives (Zenchu), about 80,000 hectares are likely to be 
turned back into paddies in 1994. 
  Since the 1993 acreage was 2.13 million hectares, about 2.20 
million hectares are likely to be cultivated for rice, ministry 
officials said. 
  If the crop index is 100 this year as in a usual year, 
approximately 11 million tons of rice harvest can be expected, 
about one million tons more than the yearly domestic demand. 
  After last year's poor harvest which saw the crop index down 
to 74, the ministry decreased the size of fields that were to be 
used for other crops. 
  For fiscal 1994 and 1995, the ministry lowered its target 
for 
such fields to 600,000 hectares.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- A government panel issued a 
report Friday [27 May] suggesting that planned deregulation on 
Japan's telecommunications industry should be designed to 
nurture sound competition. 
  The report was submitted to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata at a 
meeting of the Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters 
headed by the premier. 
  The administrative reform task force has been studying 
deregulations in wide areas of industry to give foreign firms 
greater access to Japanese markets, and consequently to help 
reduce Japan's massive trade surpluses. 
  The report reviewed current regulations in the 
telecommunications and broadcasting fields, and said 
deregulation should be designed to create advanced systems for 
the 21st century like the "information superhighway" plan by the 
United States. 
  It particularly stressed the necessity of removing barriers 
between domestic and international telecommunications businesses. 
  Regional telecommunications service operators should be 
encouraged to participate in the field of long-distance 
services, which would increase sound competition, it said. 
  The report's recommendations will be included in a larger 
deregulation plan to be compiled by the end of June. 
  Sources at the panel said Hata voiced eagerness to carry out 
the deregulation plan, saying the telecommunications and 
information areas are vital for the world moving to a new 
century, and also important for Japan itself to create new 
businesses. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also participated at the 
panel 
meeting and said Japan should take part in the worldwide race of 
building new telecommunications and broadcasting systems. 
  Cable News Network of the U.S. and the British Broadcasting 
Corp. are strengthening their footholds in Asia and Japan should 
join them, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- The Construction Ministry 
Thursday [26 May] decided to create a committee to study the 
public works cost differential between Japan and other 
countries, such as the United States, and ways of narrowing the 
gap. 
  The committee, led by vice minister Shigeo Mochizuki, will 
hold its first meeting on Friday. 
  The 12-member committee will draw up an action program by 
October or November on how to narrow differences in such areas 
as costs, personnel, materials and machinery. 
  The ministry last year compared the cost of Japanese 
materials, machinery and other areas in flood control projects 
with U.S. costs. 
  It found that costs in Japan were on average 30 percent 
higher than those in the U.S.

manufacturing production for the January-March first quarter 
increased 1.5 percent from the previous period, registering the 
first rise in four quarters, the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry (MITI) said Wednesday [25 May]. 
  Shipments also scored the first growth in four quarters with 
a 1.9 percent climb, MITI said. 
  But the readings do not mean Japan's industrial activity 
recovered fully, a MITI official said, citing seasonal factors 
in the reporting quarter. 
  In the January-March period last year, industrial output 
also 
turned higher as corporations stepped up manufacturing activity 
before closing their book March 31, the official said. 
  Inventories dropped 1.9 percent in the first quarter for the 
second straight quarterly fall. 
  The inventory-to-sales ratio declined 4.2 percent, the first 
decline in three quarters, MITI said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- NEC Corp. said Wednesday [25 
May] it will introduce a new mainframe computer for parallel 
processing on the domestic market on July 1. 
  NEC said the computer, parallel ACOS AX7300, is equipped 
with 
multiple microprocessor units (MPUS), which make low-cost, 
high-performance parallel processing possible. 
  The mpus are based on complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor 
(CMOS) technology, which is used in personal computers, NEC said. 
  Existing mainframes use customized semiconductors. 
  NEC said eight models of the computer, at the low end of its 
mainframe computer line, will be available to companies for 
monthly rental charges from 580,000 yen, 40 percent lower than 
for existing mainframes. 
  The company controls 27 percent of Japan's mainframe market.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The Bank of Japan is trying 
to confirm a bottom to the economic downturn, Governor Yasushi 
Mieno indicated Friday [27 May]. 
  He said, in a Tokyo speech sponsored by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, 
that he is closely monitoring economic activities since April to 
determine whether recent signs of improvement were one-time 
factors to the March-end of fiscal year. 
  "The basis for movement toward recovery is being prepared," 
he said. But he could not rule out the effect of fiscal 
year-end factors. 
  Among the recent bright signs in Japan's economy, Mieno 
cited 
improving consumption and production trends, but said more time 
is needed to see if they continue and spread to a general 
recovery. 
  The economy is in a better position than a year ago, when 
hopes of recovery were dashed by such factors as the soaring yen 
and bad weather, Mieno said, citing corporate stock adjustments, 
the support of fiscal and monetary stimulus and global economic 
improvement. 
  But he repeated concerns about volatile currency movements, 
employment and continuing balance-sheet adjustments, which he 
said are only half-way through. He noted that capital spending 
continues to decline and said he could not rule out an economic 
effect from the long delay in enacting the fiscal 1994 national 
budget. 
  Mieno also denied that leading industrial nations have a 
secret agreement to coordinate their interest rate policies, 
saying finance leaders of the Group of Seven (G-7) countries 
have been misunderstood. 
  Within the broad goal of promoting sustainable growth 
without 
inflation, each G-7 central bank determines credit policy based 
on its own country's economic conditions, he stressed. 
  G-7 finance ministers and central bankers agreed at a recent 
Washington meeting to stay in close contact and cooperate on 
their common aim, but Japan is "absolutely not following any 
other country's monetary policy," Mieno said. 
  Market players have interpreted recent rate hikes in the 
United States, cuts in Germany and the Bank of Japan's guiding 
of market rates to record lows as a concerted effort to boost 
the dollar and curb the yen and mark.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- The banking system will see 
a net liquidity surplus of 4.10 trillion yen in June, the Bank 
of Japan (BOJ) said Friday [27 May]. 
  The projected surplus, excluding government bond issuance, 
reflects a 6.20 trillion yen net inflow of treasury funds, 
against a net drainage from the system of 2.10 trillion yen in 
cash. 
  The 4.10 trillion yen surplus compares with a 3.99 trillion 
yen net surplus seen a year earlier. 
  The central bank said the cash outflow will be caused by 
summer bonus payments for civil servants and private-sector 
employees. 
  The outstanding cash balance is projected to increase 5.7 
percent at the end of June from a year earlier. 
  Redemption of government bonds, meanwhile, will be a major 
booster for treasury fund inflows, the bank said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan's economy remains in a 
slump with no bottom yet in sight, although an end is probably 
on the way, the economic planning chief said Friday [27 May]. 
  Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning 
Agency (EPA), said his view "has not changed much" from a month 
ago, when he pronounced the economy to be in an "extremely 
severe" state at the outset of the cabinet of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata. 
  "As of now, we can't see the bottom," Terasawa told a 
regular 
news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  But he said he finds himself on the verge of declaring the 
economy to be "brightening" as such signs as consumption improve. 
  He noted such continued worries as falling capital spending 
but said, "there are not so many gloomy figures, so the bottom 
should be coming some time." 
  Terasawa also said he sees no connection between talk of 
raising the consumption tax from 3 percent as part of a broad 
tax system overhaul, and Hata's order to freeze hikes in public 
service charges for the rest of the year.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Sales at large-scale retail

  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said 
combined sales at 421 department stores and 2,056 supermarkets

  Sales at supermarkets dropped 4.0 percent to 837.70 billion 
yen, posting the 21st straight month of decline. 
  The ministry said sales of clothing, the mainstay item at 
department stores, declined 2.0 percent, while those of foods 
and beverages were down 2.6 percent. 
  Sales of furniture by department stores plunged 9.1 percent 
and sales of household goods declined 4.8 percent, it said. 
  Department stores' sales of home electrical appliances 
posted 
a 3.0 percent fall. 
  At supermarkets, clothing sales dropped 5.4 percent from a 
year earlier while sales of foods and beverages declined 3.4 
percent, the ministry said.

percent while supermarket sales were down 3.4 percent, the 
ministry said.

<F P=106> ["Statement" issued by the National Army of Democratic </F>
Kampuchea spokesman on 26 May; place not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] 1. High-ranking U.S. officials have arrived in 
Phnom Penh to consider military assistance to the two-headed 
government. 
  2. This is further irrefutable proof that the United States 
is interfering directly and deeply in the Cambodian issue. 
  The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] has repeatedly 
exposed this interference, and the international community is 
well aware of the fact that the Western alliance headed by the 
United States has continued kindling the Hanoi Vietnamese war of 
aggression in Cambodia by relying on the communist Vietnamese 
forces and their Cambodian puppets. The military offensives 
against Phnum Chhat, Stoung, Anlung Veng, and Pailin provide 
clear proof. 
  They have suffered repeated defeats in this war they have 
continued to kindle. Their forces are collapsing everywhere. 
In view of this situation, the Western allies, particularly the 
United States, have not sought an appropriate and peaceful 
solution that is beneficial to all sides for the Cambodian 
people [words indistinct]. They have resorted to every means to 
continue the war through to the end. 
  3. Military assistance from the United States and Western 
powers will hamper the Cambodian king's roundtable before it is 
even held. 
  4. Despite the announcement and appeal for military aid for 
the two-headed government made by Australian Foreign Minister 
Gareth Evans and Winston Lord, the U.S. assistant secretary of 
state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, ministers from the 
ASEAN countries and other peace-loving countries in the region 
and around the world have vehemently opposed such aid. They 
have demanded national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia in 
order to end the Cambodian problem permanently. But the United 
States has stubbornly sent its high-ranking officials to Phnom 
Penh to discuss the aid issue. This constitutes shameless and 
arrogant contempt for the Cambodian people and the entire 
international community. 
  The PDK, National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK], and 
Cambodian nation and people most vehemently condemn the United 
States and Western allies providing military aid to the 
two-headed government. This aid will only kindle the communist 
Vietnamese war of aggression even more vigorously. The 
Cambodian nation and people do not want this war. The entire 
world has already said that the tragedy in Cambodia began after 
the United States interfered in Cambodia's internal affairs in 
1970 and the communist Vietnamese kindled the war to massacre 
the Cambodian people at the end of 1978. Therefore, the United 
States should stop interfering in Cambodian affairs. The 
Cambodian nation and people and the NADK will continue to fight 
resolutely against all of the enemy's maneuvers -- whether 
military or political -- until eternal peace and national 
reconciliation is achieved for the beloved motherland. 
  [Dated] 26 May 1994 
  [Signed] The NADK spokesman

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The daily REPUBLIKA praises Philippine President 
Fidel Ramos for making a very tactical move to overcome a crisis 
in relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the 
Philippines by barring foreign delegates from attending a 
conference on East Timor to be held in that country. 
Apparently, although he put the credibility of his leadership 
at stake, Ramos attaches greater importance to Philippine 
national interests -- maintaining good relations with Indonesia. 
  What lessons can be learned from the crisis? First, 
according to REPUBLIKA, East Timor has clearly become a very 
sensitive point in the context of relations between Indonesia 
and other nations. This means that we have to reassess how 
effective our overseas campaigns on East Timor have been and 
what strategy the Department of Foreign Affairs should adopt to 
deal with such cases. Second, Indonesia has been very reactive 
to such cases. The Indonesian Government should have dealt more 
coolly and [word indistinct] with the Philippine Government with 
regard to the conference because the reactive stand only 
benefits groups opposed to the integration of East Timor into 
the Republic of Indonesia. REPUBLIKA concludes that 
anti-integration groups may have intentionally provoked 
Indonesian anger.

<F P=106> [By Akihiko Ota] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, 23 May -- A Cambodian Government 
military source disclosed on 23 May that government forces had 
secretly purchased ammunition from Vietnam for use in battles 
with the Pol Pot faction. The SRV has acted at the request of 
Cambodia, and thanks to the SRV's supply of ammunition, the 
Cambodian Government forces have gained the advantage in the 
war. However, the purchase of ammunition from Vietnam, which 
once invaded Cambodia, will likely invite strong hostility from 
the Pol Pot faction at a "roundtable conference" scheduled in 
Pyongyang in North Korea. 
  According the source, Vietnam started supplying ammunition a 
few weeks ago, transporting it to Cambodia by an overland route. 
Most of the ammunition comprises bullets for AK-47 type rifles, 
and 152mm shells and rocket shells made by the former Soviet 
Union. 
  "They have been purchased at half the price of the 
ammunition 
sold by North Korea," the source said. 
  The source said the Vietnamese military concluded the secret 
transaction at the request of cadres of the former Phnom Penh 
Government, which was once allied with the Vietnamese military, 
and is currently a major force of the Cambodian Government 
forces. The Vietnamese side then promised to back the Cambodian 
Government forces, saying: "Vietnam is ready to supply as much 
ammunition as Cambodia wants." 
  However, the source said that as Cambodia had already spent 
its defense budget for the current fiscal year, accounting for 
30 percent of the national budget, "budgets for the repair of 
national roads have been used to make the payments." 
  Although in March the government forces brought Anlong Veng 
and Pailin, the base of the Pol Pot faction, under its control, 
they were later recaptured by Pol Pot fighters. To deal with 
the situation, officials as National Defense Minister Tie Banh 
visited such countries as Russia, China, Laos, and Vietnam and 
officially asked for the supply of arms and ammunitions. Each 
nation rejected Cambodia's request on the grounds that "it would 
lead to intervention in Cambodia's domestic affairs." Among 
those approached, only North Korea showed a favorable reaction. 
However, Cambodian officials decided to ask Vietnam because 
North Korea is a long way away and it costs huge sums and takes 
a long time to transport ammunition, the source said. 
  The Cambodian Government has asked foreign nations for 
military cooperation in fighting the Pol Pot faction. In 
response, such nations as the United States and Australia have 
shown a positive stand toward the supply of arms. 
  Meanwhile, the Thai Government has announced it will reject 
the Cambodian Government's request, saying military cooperation 
would lead a spread of the fighting. 
  In an interview with SANKEI SHIMBUN, Vice Information 
Minister Kyu Knayrit [as published] said: "Although I cannot 
disclose the names of the countries, we have already received 
arms and ammunitions from some. We also had them dispatch 
military instructors a few months ago." 
  His comments amounted to an admission that Cambodia has 
received arms and military advisory groups from such nations as 
North Korea and France. 
  Proposed by Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian Government and 
the 
Pol Pot faction are scheduled to start peace talks at a 
roundtable meeting due to begin in Pyongyang on 27 May with the 
issue of the Pol Pot faction's participation in the government 
as a main topic. 
  The Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in 1978 and 
established the former Phnom Penh Government after overthrowing 
the government led by the Pol Pot faction. For that reason, the 
Pol Pot faction has since continued warfare backed by the 
Cambodians' historically deep-rooted anti-Vietnamese feelings 
and national consciousness. 
  It is seen, therefore, as inevitable that the Pol Pot 
faction 
will strongly defy and criticize Cambodia for the purchase by 
government forces of war supplies from Vietnam.

  [Text] The government's Tax Commission (an advisory panel 
to the prime minister) has decided to make an emergency proposal 
for five-point administrative reform on the assumption that 
drastic tax reform will be implemented. The proposal points out 
the need to work out "a five-year administrative reform plan," 
among other things calling for integration or abolition of 
special status corporations; to set goals for correcting the 
price gap between domestic and foreign products; and to revise 
the current system of setting public service charges. 
  Commission Chairman Kan Kato will submit a report to Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata in early June. The commission thinks that 
as it will have to come up with a recommendation on drastic tax 
reform by the end of June, the government must present to the 
public its stand on administrative and financial reform to 
obtain public understanding on tax system reform, which will 
include a consumption tax hike. The commission is also expected 
to refer to specific ways of achieving administrative reform led 
by politicians and free of meddling by bureaucrats; it is 
extremely rare for the commission to make such a recommendation. 
  The five points in the proposal comprise: 1) Formulation of 
the "five-year administrative reform plan"; 2) formulation of 
the "five- year local administrative reform plan"; 3) revision 
of the current system on setting public service charges; 4) 
setting of goals for narrowing the price gap between domestic 
and foreign products; and 5) making public how spending in 
welfare programs is calculated. 
  The commission has held informal consultations on the matter 
with the Economic Council (an advisory panel to the prime 
minister; chaired by Gaishi Hiraiwa) and the Fiscal System 
Council (an advisory panel to the finance minister; chaired by 
Eiji Suzuji) to take concerted action on tax reform. If the 
three parties reach agreement, the report is expected to be 
submitted in their joint names. Then, how Prime Minister Hata 
uses his political leadership will become a new focal point of 
issue in the goal for achieving tax reform. 
  The commission intends to ask the government to indicate 
specific areas of and plans for reform in formulating "the 
five-year administrative reform plan" including integration 
and/or abolition of government projects and government-invested 
special corporations. 
  The Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform (the third 
administrative reform council chaired by Eiji Suzuki) once tried 
to promote the plan to integrate and/or abolish special 
corporations. But, since the council tried to apply the reform 
to all special corporations, it incited opposition from the 
entire bureaucracy. As a result, the council could not 
incorporate the plan into its final report. Taking this failure 
into consideration, the Tax Commission has reached a decision to 
promote this plan by taking a different approach. 
  As far as the "five-year local administrative reform" is 
concerned, since the role of local governments in promoting the 
welfare vision programs is expected to grow, the commission will 
call for tough administrative reform in local governments, for 
instance, by proposing to set up a system to restrict the number 
of local public service personnel. 
  Regarding the issue of public service charge hikes which 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has decided to freeze, the 
commission intends to ask the government to revise the current 
system of setting charges as a way of promoting industrial 
rationalization. It is thinking about asking the government to 
replace the current system with the "price cap system" [as 
published] which sets ceiling and allows decisions on charges 
more flexibility. 
  As for the welfare vision programs, the commission will ask 
the Finance Ministry and Health and Welfare Ministry to make 
public how they came up with estimates on future welfare 
spending.

  [Text] According to a report, in his recent television 
program, U.S. Vice President Gore has made an absurd remark by 
saying that continuing talks with North Korea is dangerous, and 
that the steps taken by the United States to strengthen security 
for South Korea is wise. This is a challenging remark to create 
obstacles to resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula, as well as to further lead the situation of the 
Korean peninsula to the crisis situation. [chongseul 
wigisanghanguro] 
  Judging from the open remarks made by U.S. hardline 
conservative forces indicating that continuing talks with the 
DPRK is dangerous, they are not interested in resolving the 
nuclear issue, but rather plot to isolate and crush [apsal] us 
by force. The U.S. hardline conservative forces' pursuing its 
unchanged policy of crushing Korea and of regarding it as an 
enemy has been well disclosed in the open remarks made by U.S. 
Senator McCain, at the Senate on 24 May demanding that the 
United States execute a policy of force [wanryok chongchaek], 
such as carrying out an air raid on the North Korean nuclear 
facility or attacking it with cruise missiles. Such violent 
remarks by the U.S. hardline conservative forces regarding war 
can never be forgiven because their remarks are very dangerous 
ones that make it possible to bring about an unpredictable 
situation [yechuhalsuopnun satae] on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- U.S. Vice-President 
Albert Gore reportedly appeared on a TV program recently and let 
loose a string of balderdash saying it is dangerous to continue 
talks with North Korea and that the steps taken by the United 
States to strengthen security for South Korea are "wise" ones. 
  This is a provocative outburst intended to create obstacles 
to a solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and 
bring the situation further to a phase of crisis. 
  Judging from the U.S. hardline conservative force's open 
remarks that it is dangerous to resume the talks with the DPRK, 
one can see clearly that they are not interested in a negotiated 
settlement of the nuclear issue but are scheming to isolate and 
stifle the DPRK with strength. 
  The dangerous military situation prevailing on the Korean 
peninsula today shows that the DPRK's negotiation proposal to 
establish a durable peace arrangement which will replace the 
military armistice body in Korea is just and timely, and it 
urgently requires that the proposal be carried into effect at an 
early date. 
  The United States must realize that to respond to the DPRK's 
peace initiative, instead of clinging to adventurous military 
action against it, is a reasonable view either in view of the 
interests of the United States itself or in view of the 
guarantee of regional peace. 
  The United States must opt a package solution to settle the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and normalize relations 
with the DPRK, true to its declaration before the world through 
the DPRK- U.S. joint statement.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the 
South Korean puppet Unification Board contended in a far-fetched 
way that the kidnapping of the North's lumbermen to South Korea 
from the far eastern region of Russia was a "defection" and even 
slandered the North with the absurd allegation that the North 
"is making it a political issue", according to a radio report 
from Seoul. 
  This is a brigandish logic reversing black and white which 
can convince no one and a malicious challenge to the DPRK and an 
unpardonable criminal act. 
  As has been reported, the South Korean puppet clique on May 
18 and 20 kidnapped again six citizens of the DPRK engaged in 
regular Tree-felling in the far east of Russia and took them to 
Seoul. This kidnapping is really an inhumanitarian act of 
destroying happy families of members of the nation and producing 
more separated families and a heinous crime of leading the 
frozen North-South relations to an extreme phase of strain. 
  It is needless to say that the kidnapping of lumbermen of 
the 
DPRK was a product of the intentional and premeditated 
anti-communist, anti-North intrigues of the South Korean puppet 
Security Planning Board to impair the international image of the 
DPRK and aggravate the North-South relations. 
  The puppets describe our kidnapped lumbermen as "displaced 
persons," which is totally nonsensical. In general, a displaced 
person means a war refugee or a sufferer from a natural 
calamity. But what a war or a natural disaster hit the far east 
of Russia to make the lumbermen of the DPRK "displaced persons"? 
  Still more preposterous is the claim of the South Korean 
puppets that the lumbermen of the North went to South Korea 
voluntarily. 
  The DPRK Government shows all solicitude for the lumbermen 
who are devotedly working in the far east of Russia to do their 
bit for the prosperity and development of the country so that 
they may not feel the least inconveniences, and grants large 
state benefits to their families in the homeland. 
  It is quite unimaginable that our lumbermen who devote 
themselves to tree felling with patriotic enthusiasm, inspired 
by the benevolence of the socialist system, should betray the 
beloved motherland and voluntarily go to the cursed land of 
South Korea, a barren land of human rights. 
  The "exile" of the North's lumbermen advertized by the 
puppets is a fiction to cover up their brigandish kidnapping. 
  Foolish, indeed, are the puppets who, after committing the 
anti- national and inhumane crime, are attempting to mislead 
public opinion by alleging that the North is making the kidnap 
case "a political issue". 
  The very one making it a political issue is none other than 
the South Korean puppet clique which took away the North's 
workers to South Korea and is using them for a sinister 
political purpose. 
  In order to organize the kidnapping of the North's 
lumbermen, 
the puppets "decided" a "policy of receiving exiles" at a 
"unification and security coordinating meeting" on April 15 and 
then formed even the "working measure committee" to launch into 
a full-scale kidnapping operation. 
  This fact alone shows well that the puppets made the 
kidnapping of the North's lumbermen a political issue from the 
beginning. 
  The South Korean puppet clique must stop the ridiculous acts 
of a thief turning on the master with a club, and 
unconditionally and immediately send back all our lumbermen they 
kidnapped this time and apologize to the nation for committing 
inhumanitarian act, impairing the dignity of the nation even in 
an alien land. 
  If they continue kidnapping our lumbermen, not sending back 
the spirited ones, that will bring irrevocable grave 
consequences to the North-South relations as a whole and the 
puppets will be held wholly responsible for them.

  [Text] The United States and North Korea held a 
working-level contact in New York this morning, Korean time, and 
discussed a date for the third round of talks. 
  During the contact held upon the request of North Korea, 
North Korea is likely to respond to a U.S. proposal on holding 
the third round of talks in Geneva next month. 
  A source in Washington said that even though North Korea's 
response is not known yet, chances are high that the third round 
of U.S.-North Korea talks will be held in Geneva early next 
month. In the event the current New York contact proceeds 
smoothly, it is likely that a date for the third round of 
U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be officially announced, 
the source added. 
  In the contact, (Seymour), deputy chief of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Bureau of the U.S. State Department, and 
Quinones, the State Department's North Korea desk officer, 
participated as representatives of the U.S. side while Han 
Song-yol, counselor of the North Korean mission to the United 
Nations, represented the North side.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- Japan will hold 
working-level talks with the United States in Washington next 
Thursday to find ways to increase U.S-made auto and auto parts 
exports to this country, a Japanese trade ministry official said 
Friday [27 May]. 
  The meeting is in line with Tuesday's accord between Tokyo 
and Washington to restart the stalled trade "framework" talks, 
said an official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry (MITI) who declined to be named. 
  The official said the planned talks on auto trade, one of 
the 
three priority fields under the framework negotiations, will 
focus on setting "objective criteria" designed to gauge the 
openness of Japan's market. 
  The meeting will then be followed by subcabinet-level 
consultations expected to be held in Tokyo in the week starting 
June 5, the MITI official said. 
  Tokyo will not accept any objective criteria on auto trade 
that are tantamount to "numerical targets," the official said, 
apparently reflecting growing concern in Japan over a possible 
revival of the issue of numerical targets. 
  Under Tuesday's bilateral accord, the U.S. showed its 
explicit commitment not to seek any numerical targets in coming 
sectoral trade talks with Japan. 
  But U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor soon said 
Washington will pursue "result-oriented" accords in sectoral 
talks, generating concern over the question of numerical targets 
among Japanese Government officials, including MITI Chief Eijiro 
Hata. 
  In Tuesday's talks, Tokyo and Washington refrained from 
defining numerical targets in order to get the deadlocked trade 
talks moving forward. 
  The MITI official said what the Japanese side considers 
numerical targets are quantitative pledges by the government 
regarding future trade performance and trade areas beyond 
government control. 
  Talks to establish a new trade framework have been put on 
hold since February's rupture over the definition of objective 
criteria. 
  The MITI official confirmed that Tokyo has accepted the 
latest U.S. request for including five additional trade areas in 
the priority fields of government procurement, insurance and 
trade in auto and auto parts. 
  Talks on the new areas -- financial services, sheet glass, 
forestry products, intellectual property rights and competition 
policy -- may begin next week, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- International Trade and 
Industry Minister Eijiro Hata on Friday voiced concern over a 
possible revival of Japan-U.S. wrangling over "numerical trade 
targets." Failure to define numerical targets in the latest 
bilateral talks has left "a source of contention" for upcoming 
sectoral trade negotiations, Hata told a news conference. 
  Japan and the United States agreed Tuesday to restart the 
stalled trade "framework" talks in the three priority fields. In 
the accord, Washington pledged not to seek numerical targets for 
"objective criteria" in measuring the openness of Japan's 
markets. But both parties avoided a definition of numerical 
targets, a chief factor that has divided them since February, 
apparently placing more emphasis on getting the deadlocked talks 
moving again. 
  Hata said what to use or not to use for objective criteria 
will be decided in the upcoming trade talks on a 
sector-by-sector basis. Criteria to be set should not be close 
to the idea of numerical targets, Hata added. 
  Immediately after Tuesday's accord to reopen the bilateral 
trade talks, a senior Japanese trade ministry official said he 
is convinced that a major hurdle for establishing a new trade 
framework between Japan and the U.S. has been cleared with 
Washington's commitment not to seek numerical targets. But U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Washington's trade 
stance regarding Japan remains unchanged, noting it will pursue 
"result-oriented" accords on sectoral talks. 
  Turning to utility charges, the trade minister indicated 
conditional support for extending the current discounted rates 
beyond the expiration of September 30. Charges on gas and 
electricity were cut last fall as part of efforts to pass on to 
consumers windfall profits from the yen's sharp appreciation 
against the dollar. The discount should be taken as a temporary 
measure and whether or not to keep the current rates is 
basically a matter for the private sector, Hata said. But the 
discount could remain in place depending on exchange rates and 
crude oil prices, Hata said. 
  Hata welcomed the latest U.S. decision to extend China's 
most- favored-nation trade status, saying China's economy will 
be "vitalized."

  [Text] Forces of the rebel Shan warlord Khun Sa have 
pushed to within 6 km of the strategic eastern Burmese town of 
Tachilek, where 700 government troops face food and water 
shortages, a rebel source said yesterday. 
  "We hope to capture Tachilek," an official of Khun Sa's Mong 
Tai army said. "Our men are very near to the town and the 
defenders are nearly out of food." 
  Last week the rebels, mostly members of Burma's minority 
Shan 
population, reportedly stormed three Rangoon government bases 
near Tachilek and blew up a dam at the town's main reservoir. 
  Heavy fighting at the three government outposts on hills 
surrounding Tachilek between May 17 and 27 resulted in the 
deaths of 160 Burmese troops and 80 wounded, according to the 
Mong Tai army official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
  He said 17 Mong Tai army troop were killed in the fighting 
and another 39 were wounded. 
  Tachilek is the main border trade link to the northernmost 
Thai town of Mae Sai, 1,165 km north of Bangkok. 
  Burmese forces had been reinforced in the area in recent 
months in anticipation of a major offensive, but the Shan rebels 
launched a series of attacks two weeks ago that appeared to put 
Rangoon government troops on the defensive. 
  The Mong Tai army official said two Burmese military jets 
based at an air base at Tachilek flew two sorties May 17-18 
during fierce fighting around the village of Mong Kyawt, about 
24 km from the Thai border. 
  He said the Burmese jets dropped bombs from a high altitude 
because "they are afraid of our missiles." 
  Khun Sa's army, financed through taxes on opium caravans and 
heroin refineries in the Shan State, is equipped with 
surface-to-air missiles. 
  The half-Shan, half-Chinese warlord has been indicted on 
drug 
trafficking charges by a US federal court. 
  A Thai Third Army officer at the border identified the 
Burmese jets as F-7 fighter-bombers, which had been purchased by 
the Rangoon government from China. 
  The fighting in Burma has forced hundreds of Shan, Akha and 
Lahu tribesmen to seek shelter in Thailand because they fear 
being rounded up and forced to carry munitions for the Burmese. 
  Burma's military government, which has been trying to 
establish its control in the Shan State and other rebel-held 
areas for more than 40 years, routinely uses press-ganged 
civilian "porters" to carry supplies.

  [Text] MANERPLAW -- Karen guerrilla leaders have denied 
that their group has formed a political or military alliance 
with opium warlord Khun Sa and his Mong Tai Army (MTA). 
  They said any connection with Khun Sa would only tarnish the 
Karen's anti-narcotics image and reputation. 
  But they did accept that a Karen team had recently made a 
trip to the MTA-controlled area in southern Shan State and met 
Khun Sa. 
  Leaders of the Karen National Union [KNU] said in separate 
interviews that the two-member Karen delegation went to attend 
the celebration of Khun Sa's declaration of an independent Shan 
State and his appointment as Shan State President. 
  The delegation also studied how the MTA had acquired 
logistics and military supplies. 
  The Karen statements came amid strong rumours and reports 
that the Karen and the MTA have struck a deal to cooperate in 
their fight against the ruling Burmese military regime in 
Rangoon. 
  The Burmese defence attache to Bangkok, Col Thein Swe, told 
The NATION early this month that the Karen team went to Shan 
State between April 10-12 to teach Khun Sa's private army how to 
produce anti-personnel mines, and to help set up a munitions 
factory. 
  Thein Swe's charges have been rejected as "groundless 
accusations" aimed at discrediting the Karen and anti-Rangoon 
ethnic movement. 
  In separate interviews with The NATION, KNU President Gen Bo 
Mya, KNU secretary-general Badow Ba Thin, and KNU secretary for 
the organisation department, Maj Gen Maung Maung, flatly 
rejected the Burmese junta's allegations and denied any 
cooperation with Khun Sa and his Mong Tai Army. 
  They said the allegations were intentionally spread to 
discredit the Karen image and reputation, as the KNU had long 
been widely accepted as being against the drug trade. Bo Mya 
said much of the information about the Karen and Khun Sa was 
"exaggerated and untrue". 
  "There is no military cooperation, or any type of political 
cooperation, between the KNU and Khun Sa and his MTA. And there 
will be no cooperation in the future, because I feel that there 
is some kind of understanding between Khun Sa and Slorc [State 
Law and Order restoration Council]," said Bo Mya. 
  The Burmese junta Slorc, or the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council, staged a coup in September, 1988 to 
suppress a nationwide pro-democracy protest. 
  Bo Mya said the Karen delegation went to Khun Sa's area to 
attend the inauguration ceremony after Khun Sa declared the 
independence of the Shan State. The purpose of the trip was "to 
study his type of (political) system, how many people attended 
it (the ceremony) and the real feeling of the Shan population.'' 
  According to Maj Gen Maung Maung, Khun Sa had sent men to 
the 
KNU to ask about developments in peace talks between the Karen 
and Slorc, and invited the Karen to send representatives to the 
Shan celebration. 
  The two men sent to Shan State were KNU Operation Commander, 
Lt Col Law Wadi, and Lt Col Isaac, the KNU assistant quarter 
master responsible for rations and military equipment. 
  KNU secretary-general Badow Ba Thin said the Karen team 
studied how Khun Sa could purchase new supplies of arms and 
ammunition. 
  He rejected the allegation that the Karen trained the Mong 
Tai Army in how to produce landmines, saying that the MTA 
already had the capacity to do so with the help of some 
Europeans. 
  "We got information that the MTA was able to purchase arms 
and ammunitions and can get new supplies. We wanted to know how 
he could obtain them," said Ba Thin. 
  "We also understand that Khun Sa is in a position to 
manufacture landmines because some Europeans visit his area very 
frequently.'' 
  While the KNU staunchly denies any official deals with Khun 
Sa, well-informed border sources confirmed that the Karen and 
other anti-Rangoon ethnic movements have constant low-level and 
unofficial contacts with the MTA and the 11 ethnic groups that 
have already reached an official ceasefire agreement with Slorc. 
  One source said such contacts are normal and "crucial to the 
survival and operations of the armed ethnic groups, who often 
share overlapping territory and objectives. 
  "Most important of all they share the same enemy," said the 
source. 
  One KNU official, who requested anonymity, told The NATION 
that the Karen would consider or take whatever measures or steps 
they have to if they are forced into a corner. 
  He was apparently pointing to the pressure put on the group 
by some Thai authorities and brokers, who have threatened to cut 
supply lines or push back ethnic refugees unless the Karen enter 
peace negotiations with Slorc. 
  "We cannot rule out anything and have to consider every 
possible means ... The enemy of my enemy is my friend," the 
official said. 
  Slorc has urged the Karen, the Mon and the Karenni -- the 
three remaining active armed groups fighting the Rangoon regime 
-- to hold ceasefire talks, but has ruled out similar 
negotiations with Khun Sa, saying that Rangoon considers him a 
drug trafficker and will deal with him by force.

  [Text] Mae Sai, Chiang Mai -- Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army 
(MTA) claimed yesterday it inflicted severe damage on Rangoon's 
forces during ten days of fierce battles in the Shan State 
opposite northern Thailand. 
  MTA claimed in a statement yesterday it had killed 150 of 
Rangoon's troops and injured about 100 others. 
  The statement claimed the MTA had also captured three 
government bases and destroyed a dam which has flooded the Mae 
Sai River near Tachilek. 
  The main column of MTA soldiers have moved closer to 
Tachilek, a government-controlled border town opposite here, MTA 
sources claimed. 
  The opium warlord's army lost 17 guerrillas and suffered 39 
injuries during the fighting described as the heaviest in 40 
years. 
  The war has sent a large number of Burmese villagers across 
the border but many have been sent back by Thai authorities who 
have beefed up security along the border to prevent the fighting 
from spilling over. 
  Troops from the Third Army and Border Patrol policemen have 
been sent to man border passes along the Thai-Burmese frontier. 
  Tachilek has been nearly deserted since the fighting began. 
  Young men have left the town to stay closer to the border in 
apparent preparation to cross over leaving women children and 
the aged behind for fear of being recruited to become arms 
porters. 
  The Burmese border town, which only days ago was bustling 
with trading activity, has become quiet because of the drastic 
drop in Thai and foreign tourist arrivals. 
  Tachilek is now being defended by about 500 government 
troops. 
  Military sources said Rangoon's military drive against Khun 
Sa's MTA was aimed at opening up a strategic route in the Shan 
State for the government force to attack three minority rebel 
groups along the Thai western border. 
  The sources claimed SLORC [State Law and Order Restoration 
Council] planned to open an all-out military campaign against 
the Karen National Union [KNU], the Karenni Nation Progress 
Party [KNPP] and the New Mon [State] Party [NMSP] if peace talks 
failed. 
  Rangoon has negotiated a peace settlement with eight 
northern 
minority groups. The Kachin Independent Organisation, the 
second largest member of the anti-Rangoon Democratic Alliance of 
Burma [DAB] has become the latest rebel movement to lay down 
arms. 
  No headway has been made in peace talks between SLORC and 
the 
KNU, the KNPP and the NMSP because Rangoon wants negotiations to 
be held in Burma and the others, especially the KNU, which is 
the largest member of the DAB, wants the talks in a neutral 
country. 
  The sources said Rangoon was expected to declare all-out war 
with the three rebel factions if the peace talks failed, by 
telling the world it had done its best to stop the armed 
struggle.

<F P=106> [Message from Dr. Sein Win, prime minister of the National </F>
Coalition Government of the Union of Burma, to the Burmese 
people on the 4th anniversary of the multiparty general 
election--recorded] 
  [Text] Dear parents and people: I am very grateful for the 
opportunity to convey my message to you through the Democratic 
Voice of Burma on this important occasion, the 4th anniversary 
of the 1990 general election. At this important moment, it is 
right for the everyone, including the defense services 
personnel, to ask the following questions: What is happening in 
our country? Who are the persons most responsible for what is 
going on in the country? What caused these things to happen? 
How can the country be extricated from these crises? 
  The political, economic, and social conditions have been 
deteriorating. Burma has been listed as the least developed 
nation in the world and the poorest nation in Asia. Amid these 
political crises, the government which the people are demanding 
and yearning for is yet to emerge. The people are facing social 
problems and human right violations. 
  Dear parents and people: Who are the persons most 
responsible for these events? It could not denied that General 
Ne Win, Senior General Saw Maung, the present generals and 
colonels of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, and 
SLORC Chairman Sr. Gen. Than Shwe, the leaders of the military 
clique which have been ruling Burma for 30 years, are 
responsible for these events. These events took place because 
they took the wrong path after the 1962 coup. They practiced the 
Burmese way to socialism, which said the precepts could be 
observed only when the belly is full. In the end, the people 
have reached the point where they cannot fill their bellies nor 
observe the basic precepts of everyday life. 
  Dear parents and people: The Defense Services is interfering 
in government administration and economy, which are irrelevant 
to the Defense Services, while going astray from its original 
responsibilities of defending the nation and fulfilling the 
desires of the people. The generals, colonels, and former 
military officers are also taking the high official positions. 
It is the beginning of the destruction of the country. Instead 
of resolving the political problems by political means, the 
Defense Services is increasing the military budget excessively 
and (?establishing militarism in the country). Now the generals 
have also created their own dollar market. 
  Dear Parents and People: There is only one way to extricate 
Burma from all these crises. That is, the Defense Services has 
to stop continuing its previous mistakes and find a solution by 
holding discussions with the democratic force led by Daw Aung 
San Suu Kyi and the national ethnic forces. This is the only 
answer. If the Defense Services continue to meet with only whom 
it wants to meet and do what it wants to do, then the national 
interests, including the interests of the Defense Services, will 
be affected. 
  Dear parents and people: Up to this date, the SLORC has 
ignored the wishes of the people and the 1990 election results. 
It is a disgrace for the SLORC to say to the international 
community that the election was free and fair at first, and then 
to say later that a firm constitution is needed after the NLD 
[National League for Democracy] led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi won 
the landslide victory. We strongly believe that the political 
power must originate with the people. Due to the changes in the 
world and the political changes in Burma, there is no doubt that 
people will get the democracy which they are yearning for. 
  Not along ago, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi mentioned that we cannot 
say all the problems will be resolved on their own once 
democracy is achieved, but when democracy is achieved all people 
will have the right to contribute their utmost in the 
development of the country. We all must understand this. Help 
one another. Especially, people have to be aware of SLORC's 
attempt to drive a wedge between the people and the Defense 
Services, among the people, and among the students. Continue to 
struggle with your unwearied diligence. 
  Dear parents and people: I extend my best wishes for your 
health and prosperity.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of statement issued by the National Coalition </F>
Government of the Union of Burma on the fourth anniversary of 
the 1990 multiparty general election on 27 May] 
  [Text] The date 27 May is the fourth anniversary of the 
1990 multiparty general election in which the National League 
for Democracy led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi won a landslide 
victory. The result of this election showed the desire of the 
entire Burmese citizenry for democracy. The SLORC [State Law 
and Order Restoration Council] military clique has denied this 
desire for democracy and continued to refuse to hand over state 
power to the elected civilian representatives. Moreover, the 
SLORC has also detained Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other 
parliamentarians and democratic activists. The SLORC military 
clique is not only violating human rights by arresting civilians 
as forced laborers, but it has also conducted cease-fire 
negotiations while isolating the ethnic and democratic forces 
with the help of some neighboring countries. The Thai 
Government is also strongly prohibiting the democratic 
activities of the anti-SLORC groups inside Thailand. The rank 
and file from the Defense Services, except the SLORC military 
leaders, are also suffering from poverty like ordinary civilians. 
  In respect to [words indistinct] and various situations, the 
National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma has made the 
following demands: 
  Avoid giving legal recognition to the SLORC military clique 
and the National Convention organized by the clique, stop the 
SLORC human rights violations, find ways to hold (?a meeting) 
that will allow Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other nationality 
leaders to participate in it, and make SLORC comply with the UN 
General Assembly resolution on Burma and the International Human 
Rights Charter. 
  The statement also said the American Government must lay 
down 
a clear-cut policy on Burma. It also called for the 
cancellation of Thailand's invitation to Burma to attend the 
ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting, continued denunciation of the 
SLORC (?by countries which helped pass the UN resolution on 
Burma and by other countries), and urged the UN secretary 
general to appoint a special Burmese envoy soon.

  [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], May 27 (ANTARA) - The Indonesian 
delegation headed by Coordinating Minister for Industry and 
Trade Hartarto on Friday morning made a study tour of industrial 
projects at Syriam, a suburban town opposite to Yangon [Rangoon] 
across the Yangon River. 
  On Friday afternoon, the Indonesian businessmen who came 
here 
as part of the Indonesian delegation met and held talks with the 
Myanmar [Burma] minister for trade, Lt. Gen. Tun Kyi, for 
promoting trade relations between the two countries. 
  Minister Tun Kyi and Myanmar trade officials and Indonesian 
businessmen discussed ways and means of increasing trade between 
Myanmar and Indonesian during the talks. 
  On Thursday morning, after the briefing given to the 
Indonesian delegation by Minister for National Planning and 
Economic Development Brig. Gen. Abel on Myanmar's economic 
development and business opportunities in Myanmar, Myanmar 
government ministers and members of the Indonesian delegation, 
including businessmen held discussions at the International 
Business Center in Yangon on matters relating to investment and 
trade. 
  During these discussions, Minister Hartarto urged the 
Indonesian businessmen to play an effective role in the 
development of Myanmar's economy. 
  Hartarto reiterated what Minister of Tourism, Post, and 
Telecommunications Joop Ave had earlier stated about Indonesia's 
willingness to provide training and technical assistance to 
Myanmar for its development of tourist industry. 
  Hartarto also stressed the need for implementing easy and 
quick telecommunications services for bringing about economic 
cooperation between Myanmar and Indonesia. 
  "We will see to it that the telecommunications services 
between the two countries will soon be extended," Hartarto said 
at the discussions. 
  According to Brig. Gen. Abel's briefing, 91 economic 
organizations from 16 nations have invested in Myanmar about 
1.056 billion U.S. dollars within five-year period from 
September 1988 to March 1994. 
  The Indonesian delegation will leave for home at 3 pm on 
Friday. 
  Myanmar government officials here look upon the visit of 
Indonesian delegation led by Hartarto as "a great success" that 
will usher in a new era of economic cooperation between the two 
countries for mutual benefit.

  [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- The leaderships of the two 
major political powers, the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) and 
the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), today discussed the future 
of the cabinet, their representatives said today at their 
regular weekly news briefings. "The time of waiting and 
half-way measures is running out," said BSP deputy floor leader 
Georgi Pirinski, voicing his party's stand. BSP expects that 
the prime minister's ideas about cabinet changes would become 
clear by the end of the week. "The cabinet should go instead of 
reshuffling," said SDS leader Filip Dimitrov. 
  According to BSP analyses, confrontation in society has been 
further exacerbated, yet Bulgaria has the real chances of 
stabilizing its law and order and its foreign economic 
relations. The Socialists have not changed their demands to the 
Cabinet; yet they have never raised the issue of the restoration 
of ministries or reinstatement of persons. "Structural and 
personnel changes lie within Prime Minister Berov's own 
discretion," Mr. Pirinski said. In his view, Mr. Berov has not 
shown he is decisive enough to "make a U-turn in the cabinet's 
performance." BSP set several demands to the government: 
resumption of political dialogue with the trade unions, 
stabilization of the national budget, setting in motion 
structural adjustment, unblocking privatization, etc. "Unless 
Mr. Berov makes his ideas clear by the end of the week, BSP will 
reconsider its stand," the Socialists said at their news 
conference. 
  Later in the day, Socialists' leaders held an unscheduled 
meeting with Prime Minister Berov, national television reported 
in its main newscast. 
  "The prime minister alone can say how far things have been 
specified with him. I can't say that because what is going on 
now is a change in his notions, frame of mind and intentions. 
There will be continuous changes in the coming days and weeks, 
they will be exceedingly vigorous," BSP leader Zhan Videnov told 
a TV interviewer. The government Press Office specified that 
Prime Minister Lyuben Berov will address parliament tomorrow [27 
April]. 
  SDS leader Filip Dimitrov described the intended cabinet 
changes as "the latest trick of anti-national behaviour on the 
part of the communist parliamentary majority." At a regular 
meeting today, the SDS top leadership considered its reaction 
which will depend on whether the cabinet changes will be 
introduced before parliament on Wednesday or not. Mr. Dimitrov, 
however, did not specify the strategies adopted. 
  The parliamentary New Union for Democracy (SDS expellees and 
defectors) and the MP's of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (DPS) today met to discuss the intended policy 
which Prime Minister Berov is expected to set forth before 
parliament tomorrow, as well as his concept of structural 
cabinet changes. 
  The two factions agreed that no structural and personnel 
changes are necessary until parliament's Easter recess, said the 
spokesman for the parliamentary DPS Yunal Lyutfi. During and 
after the recess, the two factions will continue their 
consultations with Prime Minister Berov on the government's 
programme and the need of personnel and structural cabinet 
changes. 
  The forthcoming structural changes in the cabinet were 
discussed today by Prime Minister Berov with Mr. Aleksandur 
Tomov, leader of the Civil Alliance for the Republic (a radical 
movement which broke away from the BSP), national radio 
reported. Mr. Tomov said that certain political forces should 
not take advantage of the grave economic situation to put 
pressure on the government. According to him, in order to avoid 
a power vacuum and an economic collapse, political forces must 
reach a consensus on the changes needed by Prof. Berov's cabinet.

  [Text] Sofia, April 27 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov today submitted before parliament a declaration on 
the cabinet's programme by year's end. Providing income 
adjustments after prices nearly doubled in late March and early 
April and offering national security guarantees were pointed as 
the major tasks facing the cabinet at that particular moment. 
The declaration also proposed that deputy prime ministers be 
put in charge of the social policy, structural adjustment in 
economy and foreign policy, and a minister, on foreign 
investments. 
  Prof. Berov's declaration was prompted by the demands of the 
pro- cabinet Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) which last week set 
April 25 as the deadline for the prime minister to come up with 
his proposals for changes in the social and economic departments 
of the cabinet and May 15 to submit a report on a new 
socioeconomic policy. 
  The cabinet's first task is to restore the lost 
prices-incomes balance and curb the rising inflation, Prof. 
Berov told the MP's. He proposed that an interdepartmental 
council on prices and incomes headed by a deputy prime minister 
be set up with the Council of Ministers to this end. He further 
vowed to bring the trade unions back to the negotiating table 
within the framework of the Tripartite Council by the end of 
this week and said the cabinet is ready to start serious 
negotiations. Bulgaria's two major labour organizations backed 
out of the tripartite negotiations after the cabinet declared it 
freezes the salaries in the state-financed sector. 
  Prof. Berov said a deputy prime minister should be appointed 
to coordinate and oversee the structural adjustment in economy. 
This step is aimed to overcome the cabinet's failure to make a 
headway with privatization, a situation which, "among other 
things, was brought about by a rift between the deputy prime 
minister in charge of privatization and the rest of the 
ministers", Prof. Berov's declaration read without naming any 
ministers. Privatization- related matters are now within the 
powers of Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev. A second 
deputy prime minister is needed to take over the foreign policy 
issues and coordinate the work of the different institutions in 
this sphere, according to the prime minister. He also said it 
is necessary to appoint a minister on trade and another one to 
take the lead of the Foreign Debt Management Committee and 
control the foreign investments. 
  Prime Minister Berov told the MP's he was considering 
changes 
in the Defence Ministry leadership. An updated programme will 
be submitted within two weeks to specify the cabinet's activity 
in two stages: the first one ending in September and the second 
one, with year's end. It will also specify the structural and 
personnel changes to be made in the cabinet. 
  An attempt of the opposition Union of the Democratic Forces 
(SDS) to put Prof. Berov's declaration to debates was voted down 
by the other parliamentary factions. SDS floor leader Stefan 
Savov asked what this declaration in fact sought to achieve, 
saying it proposed no specific personnel or structural changes, 
all the more that the cabinet had already had one programme on 
which it was formed in late 1992. Mr. Savov further reiterated 
SDS' stand that this Cabinet can no longer remain in office and 
cabinet overhauls would do no good. 
  "The assessments Prof. Berov's declaration makes are 
identical with those of the Socialist Party but what matters 
here is the prime minister's actions and the effect they will 
have," BSP floor leader Zhan Videnov said. According to Mr. 
Videnov, the personality of the those to enter the cabinet is of 
primary importance. He gave the cabinet a couple of weeks' time 
to make the effect of changes perceptible. 
  "We expected to see a more specific programme and proposals 
to underlie the forthcoming structural and personnel changes in 
the cabinet," ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
spokesman Yunal Lyutfi told a radio correspondent. 
  Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, whom the declaration 
indirectly pointed to in connection with future changes among 
senior Defence Ministry officials, said in the parliamentary 
lobbies he did not intend to resign adding that Prime Minister 
Berov was obviously subject to political pressure. 
  The MP's accepted a SDS motion that parliament tomorrow 
discuss the foreign-currency reserves and the cabinet's 
foreign-currency policy.

  [Text] Sofia, April 28 (BTA) -- Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev submitted his resignation 
at the beginning of the Council of Ministers' regular meeting 
today. 
  Valentin Karabashev is a member of the Alternative Social 
Liberal Party (ASP), which entered parliament on the ticket of 
the Union of Democratic Forces. It was expelled from the 
coalition at the end of 1992 because of its support for Lyuben 
Berov's cabinet formed under the mandate assigned to the ethnic 
Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms and backed by the 
formerly Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party, which now holds a 
majority in the National Assembly. Minister of Industry Rumen 
Bikov is also a member of the ASP. 
  Explaining his resignation in a letter to the prime 
minister, 
Mr. Karabashev says that last autumn the functions of the two 
deputy prime ministers (the other is Evgeni Matinchev, who also 
heads the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs) got confused, 
creating mistrust and chaos in the governing institution, and 
that there were several cases of the prime minister taking 
action without notifying him. Mr. Karabashev says that one of 
those cases was the prime minister's attempt to launch an idea 
of his own about privatization. In Mr. Karabashev's opinion, 
Prof. Berov's attempts to revise the operative legislation on 
privatization were the reason for its slow pace. 
  Making a declaration on the government's intentions until 
the 
end of the year in parliament yesterday [27 April], Prime 
Minister Berov blamed the slowdown in privatization on the 
deputy prime minister in charge of it and sharply criticized the 
Ministry of Trade. "The criticism of my performance as a deputy 
prime minister and minister of trade is serious but unfounded," 
Mr. Karabashev says in his letter. He also states that the 
cabinet changed planned by the prime minister are quite 
different from his own views. 
  Interviewed by the media at the Council of Ministers, 
Valentin Karabashev said that Prof. Berov had asked him not to 
be overhasty with his resignation. 
  MP Asen Michkovski of the ASP, who was at the Council of 
Ministers too, said that the party leadership would consider 
whether to withdraw its support for Prof. Berov's government or 
not. Mr. Michkovski stated that the ASP might ask another of 
its representatives in the government, Minister of Industry 
Bikov, to resign too. "I should abide by the decision of the 
ASP, but ultimately this is a question of personal choice," Mr. 
Bikov said. 
  The National Assembly is expected to debate Mr. Karabashev's 
resignation when it resumes work after the Easter recess, which 
is until May 11. It is possible that the ASP will propose an 
extraordinary sitting of parliament because there is a cabinet 
crisis in the country, as Mr. Michkovski put it.

<F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, April 29 (BTA) -- Yesterday's resignation of 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev 
is in the highlights of today's press. Most dailies carry 
frontpage reports commenting on Mr. Karabashev's motives. The 
fate of Deputy Prime Minister Karabashev was decided by his 
Alternative Social Liberal Party (ASP) as early as last week, 
reads an editorial in DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS). It goes on to say that Mr. 
Karabashev's resignation had to do with the privatization by 
businessmen close to the ASP of two hotels in the Sunny Beach 
resort on the Black Sea. Minister of Industry Rumen Bikov, the 
other ASP representative in the cabinet, will stay on for the 
time being. However, the private STANDART NEWS writes that Mr. 
Bikov was likely to resign, too. He had told the daily's report 
that he considered doing so. 
  24 CHASA carries an interview with Mr. Karabashev. "At first 
I was offered to stay as a deputy prime minister or a minister 
without portfolio, but in the course of the conversation I had 
with Mr. Berov it did not become clear to me what my 
responsibilities were supposed to be. Using other sources, I 
found out that he himself was unclear about it," he said. In 
his opinion, what the prime minister intends to do would be 
disastrous to the government. 
  OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK writes that "after Valentin Karabashev's 
resignation (backed by the parliamentary New Union for 
Democracy, which withdrew its support from Lyuben Berov's 
cabinet) the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) will now 
find itself in the spotlight and will hardly muster the courage 
to accept the conditions of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP).... Facing the threat of ultimate discredit if they do 
so, it would be no surprise if the DPS decide to follow suit and 
withdraw their support from the cabinet, thus prompting 
procedures for the formation of a new cabinet. 
  KONTINENT comments on the same issue under the headline 
"Struggle for Ministerial Posts." "The resignation of Mr. 
Karabashev as deputy prime minister paves the way for the formal 
procedures for the expected structural and personal changes 
which the government and parliament have been using for months 
to fool the crisis-crushed electorate." "The cabinet overhaul 
has nothing to do with the work the ministers have or have not 
done for the nation; it has to do with the work they have or 
have not done to satisfy certain private interests," the daily 
comments. 
  Newspapers hurry to prognosticate on the future members of 
the cabinet. STANDART NEWS mentions the names of Emil Khursev, 
ex-vice governor of the central bank, Aleksandur Tomov, leader 
of the Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR, a centrist 
formation which split off from the BSP), and Chavdar Kunchev, 
head of the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank, as possible candidates 
for the post of deputy prime minister on the foreign debt. 
According to DEMOKRATSIYA and STANDART NEWS, the next minister 
of trade would be Bulgaria's Ambassador to Japan Konstantin 
Glavanakov, a friend of ex-Prime Minister and MP of the BSP 
Andrey Lukanov.

  [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- Mr. Ian Kenyon, executive 
secretary of the preparatory commission to set up an 
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), 
told a news conference at the Foreign Ministry here today that 
Bulgaria has the political will to ratify within the coming 
weeks the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their 
Destruction. He was referring to the assurances he received 
this morning at a meeting with ranking members of the National 
Assembly Committee on National Security. 
  Mr. Kenyon said that at a meeting with military leaders of 
the General Staff he had discussed the question of Bulgaria's 
protection against a possible use of chemical weapons and the 
measures which the Bulgarian Army will take in the event of a 
threat of use of such weapons of mass destruction in a possible 
military conflict. 
  Asked by BTA whether the commission has information that any 
of the warring parties in the Yugoconflict has used chemical 
weapons, Mr. Kenyon said that he only had an information 
bulletin, according to which primitive warfare chemical agents 
like chlorine had been used in the former Yugoslavia but did not 
have evidence of the use of nerve gases. 
  These are just a couple of bulletins and not evidence, he 
emphasized. Of course, when the convention enters into force, 
inspectors will be sent there to verify the truth.

  [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- Mr. Valentin Karabashev, 
deputy prime minister and minister of trade, today received Mr. 
'Ali Akbar Torkan, Iran's minister of roads and transport, the 
government Press Office told BTA. Mr. Torkan is visiting here 
at the head of an Iranian delegation for the 9th session of the 
Bulgarian-Iranian Commission for Economic, Scientific and 
Technological Cooperation which opened yesterday [25 April]. 
  The two ministers focused on bilateral trade and payments. 
The guest emphasized that Iran has problems in repaying its 
debt to Bulgaria in hard currency. Mr. Torkan suggested 
repayment in oil, gas and industrial goods of a value equal to 
Iran's obligations to Bulgaria. 
  Mr. Karabashev stressed that the finances of most of Iran's 
Bulgarian creditors are now in a rather bad state. They will 
count on getting their money back from Iran in hard currency. 
  Later in the day, Mr. Torkan was also received by Deputy 
Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. Mr. Matinchev was briefed on 
the results of the 9th session of the Bulgarian-Iranian 
Commission for Economic, Scientific and Technological 
Cooperation. The guest reiterated Iran's desire to repay its 
debt to Bulgaria in industrial goods and oil.

<F P=106> [Report by Mariyana Barutchieva: "Bulgaria, Iran Enter New </F>
Stage of Economic Relations"] 
  [Text] Sofia, April 28 (BTA) -- The ninth session of the 
Joint Bulgarian-Iranian Commission for Economic and Technical 
Cooperation ended with the signing of three intergovernmental 
agreements. An agreement on air communications and a memorandum 
on cooperation between Iran and Bulgaria were signed by 
Bulgaria's Minister of Transport and head of the Bulgarian 
delegation Kiril Ermenkov and Iran's Minister of Roads and 
Transport 'Ali Akbar Torkan. An agreement on the avoidance of 
double taxation was initialed. The president of the Bulgarian 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Bozhidar Bozhinov, and a 
representative of the Iranian Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
signed an agreement for cooperation between the two chambers. 
  The commission has been working since April 25 in working 
groups in the spheres of industry and agriculture, trade and 
banking, oil and gas, transport and communications and 
scientific and technical cooperation. Mr. Torkan and members of 
the delegation (which included about 20 representatives of 
Iranian business circles) met with Deputy Prime Ministers Evgeni 
Matinchev and Valentin Karabashev, National Bank Governor Todor 
Vulchev, and the Deputy Minister of Industry Racho Petrov. The 
delegation visited the town of Burgas (on the Black Sea). Today 
Mr. Torkan was received by President Zhelyu Zhelev. The 
president had been informed about the results of the joint 
commission's work and expressed his support for the efforts to 
boost Bulgarian-Iranian cooperation, Mr. Ermenkov and Mr. Torkan 
told a news conference. 
  Bulgaria and Iran reached an agreement on the construction 
of 
a gas conduit from Iran to Europe. The section passing through 
Bulgaria will be built by Bulgarian engineers and workers, said 
Mr. Torkan. Besides, Bulgaria will buy 1.5 million tonnes of 
crude oil from Iran and the transaction will be effected 
directly between Iran's National Oil Company and 
Neftokhim-Burgas. The possible construction of a ferry service 
between Burgas and Novorossiysk and from there to the Middle 
East and Iran was also discussed. Industrial cooperation will be 
focused on industrial truck building, and the Bulgarian 
Balkankar company has already become part of a joint venture 
operating in Iran. Iranian zinc and copper ore concentrate will 
be processed in Bulgarian plants. No cooperation in the 
production of or trade in arms and ammunition has been discussed 
during the session, Mr. Torkan stated. 
  Responding to a question Mr. Torkan said that part of the 
debt of Iranian companies to Bulgaria that he estimates at about 
$20 million will be paid off in hard currency, another portion 
will be paid off in goods and a rescheduling agreement will be 
sought for the rest. According to experts from the Bulgarian 
Ministry of Trade, the debt runs up to $27 million. 
  The previous session of the Joint Bulgarian-Iranian 
Commission for Economic and Technical Cooperation was held in 
September 1992 in Iran.

  [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- "This was a historic 
visit," President Zhelyu Zhelev said of the first official visit 
of President of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Kiro Gligorov to Bulgaria. Mr. 
Gligorov said that after four meetings with President Zhelev so 
far he was left with the impression that "we can encourage the 
further development of mutual understanding between the two 
states and the two peoples." President Zhelev and President 
Grigorov held a press conference at the end of the two-day 
official visit Macedonia's head of state. 
  President Zhelev said that they discussed three groups of 
problems: bilateral relations, the latest developments in the 
Balkans and the relations of Bulgaria and Macedonia with the 
European and Euro-Atlantic structures. "It was established that 
we share willingness for a peaceful settlement of the conflicts 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and for the prevention of the conflict's 
expansion to Kosovo or, God forbid, to the Republic of 
Macedonia, which would pose a direct threat to Bulgaria as 
well," Dr. Zhelev pointed out. The two presidents found out 
that they both support the efforts of the United Nations, NATO, 
the United States and Russia to finally find a peaceful solution 
to the conflicts and their gradual settlement at the negotiating 
table. "Bulgaria could make a humble contribution and would 
gladly help the Republic of Macedonia in the process of its 
integration with the European and Euro-Atlantic structures: 
both with the CSCE and the Council of Europe, over which 
Bulgaria will preside from May 10," said Bulgaria's president. 
"We enjoy a serious and useful assistance on the part of 
Bulgaria in the European structures and the United Nations," 
said Mr. Gligorov. 
  "Until the Kosovo problem is resolved, there will always be 
the danger of the war spreading into Macedonia," he pointed out. 
He explained that this was the reason why Macedonia was the 
first country to ask for the preventive deployment of UN 
peacekeeping forces on its territory. "Macedonia is against the 
forming of any alliances that would lead to a new carving up of 
the Balkans," he said. In response to a question whether 
Macedonia would join the new Yugoslavia, Mr. Gligorov answered: 
"Macedonia has chosen once and forever to be an independent, 
sovereign state." 
  President Zhelev said that the visit of Mr. Gligorov to 
Bulgaria marks the end of a stage in the development of 
Bulgarian-Macedonian relations. He reminded that Bulgaria was 
the first country in the world to recognize the independence of 
Macedonia together with that of the other three former Yugoslav 
republics, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, on January 
15, 1992. He said that the present stage of the development of 
the bilateral relations was characterized by the efforts of 
Bulgarian diplomacy to gain international legal recognition for 
the Republic of Macedonia, by the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia and by the rapid 
development of trade and economic contacts. "The spontaneous 
and vigorous progress of trade and economic contacts shows, 
among other things, that official intergovernmental contacts lag 
behind the natural development process," Dr. Zhelev said. 
  In response to a question why no documents were signed 
during 
the visit, President Zhelev said that in their capacity as 
presidents he and Mr. Gligorov can only sign interstate 
treaties, and the one with Macedonia is still in a very early 
stage of preparation. He added that a couple of agreements 
could have been signed but that did not happen because of ad hoc 
artificial considerations. "There was a flexible formula, 
saying that the documents were to be signed in the official 
languages of the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of 
Bulgaria, which implied that they were two different languages. 
However, the Macedonian part insisted on the clear formula 
"Macedonian language" and because of the existing public 
opposition, which I believe is quite artificial, we refrained 
from signing anything at this stage. I believe that the problem 
will be settled; I am sure it will be," Dr. Zhelev explained. 
  "Every people has the right to chose how its language is to 
be called," claimed Macedonia's President. "We cannot sign 
anything that would question our language and I am convinced 
that the problem will be settled soon because it is a relic of 
the past and we have to face the reality," he said. He said he 
was convinced that "democratic Bulgaria will find the inner 
power to take this issue off the agenda." 
  When asked why in his address to the Bulgarian Parliament he 
failed to mention Bulgarians in Macedonia after he listed 
Macedonians, Albanians and Turks as sending their good wishes, 
Mr. Gligorov answered that according to the last census there 
were less than 3,000 Bulgarians in Macedonia. During his speech 
in parliament he was heckled with remarks like: "Are there no 
Bulgarians in Macedonia?"

  [Text] Sofia, April 27 (BTA) -- Bulgarian-Armenian 
relations have reached a new level, Armenian Foreign Minister 
Vahan Papazyan told the press at the end of his three-day formal 
visit here. He signed on Monday [25 April] a bilateral trade 
and economic cooperation accord and an agreement on cooperation 
in culture, science and education. Papazyan also held talks on 
Monday with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, the 
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev 
and National Assembly Deputy Chairman Yordan Shkolagerski. 
Earlier today he was received by Bulgarian President Zhelyu 
Zhelev to whom he delivered a message from Armenian President 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan. 
  We agreed to keep working on building the legal framework of 
bilateral relations and drafting accords on the avoidance of 
double taxation and reciprocal investment protection; experts 
should soon negotiate the signing of a Bulgarian-Armenian Treaty 
on Friendship and Cooperation, Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Daskalov told the press today. It is not so important where the 
treaty will be signed, here or in Yerevan, the important thing 
is that there is a willingness to do that as soon as possible, 
the chief Armenian diplomat said. Daskalov and Papazyan agreed 
on more frequent contacts between the two foreign ministries, 
other ministries and non-governmental organizations to boost 
business, trade and cultural relations between Bulgaria and 
Armenia. The two ministers shared information about their 
countries' positions on the conflicts in the Balkans and the 
Transcaucasian region. Papazyan said he was pleased with his 
first visit here. He described his talks with President Zhelev 
this morning as friendly and useful. 
  In answer to a question he said he did not think the 
Armenian 
community in Bulgaria faced any problems and voiced a hope it 
would have a role in the promotion of Bulgarian-Armenian 
relations. Papazyan held special meetings in Sofia and Plovdiv 
(southern Bulgaria) with representatives of the Armenian 
community. "There are no problems as to national identity", 
said the Armenian foreign minister. About 20,000 Armenians live 
in Bulgaria. 
  We've been sparing no effort to reach a political 
settlement, 
but peace will come when both sides agree, Papazyan said in 
response to a question on Nagorno-Karabakh. He voiced an 
expectation that Armenian-Turkish relations would improve and 
Armenia and Turkey would soon establish diplomatic relations and 
promote trade and economic cooperation. I believe this would 
benefit both Turkey and Armenia, he said answering a question.

  [Text] Sofia, April 28 (BTA) -- Albanian President Sali 
Berisha, who arrived on an official visit here yesterday, 
conferred with Aleksandur Yordanov, chairman of the Bulgarian 
National Assembly, for about half an hour. After addressing the 
National Assembly, he departed for Bulgaria's second largest 
city Plovdiv (southern Bulgaria). 
  "I commend highly Mr. Berisha's address to parliament as it 
spelled out clearly, without using diplomatic language, the key 
problems threatening our region: a communist legacy, imperial 
ambitions and rampant nationalism," Mr. Yordanov told reporters. 
According to him, it is not by accident that a number of Balkan 
heads of state are interested in expressing their countries' 
stands in the Bulgarian National Assembly, of all places. In 
his view, this is due to the key role which Bulgaria is playing 
in the Balkans now. On Tuesday [26 April] the Bulgarian 
National Assembly was also addressed by Macedonian [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov. 
  Mr. Berisha told the Bulgarian Parliament that "history 
confirmed on a number of occasions that Greater Serbia has 
always been a transitional, unstable structure and a source of 
war, conflicts, destabilization and aggression." Asked if he 
shared Mr. Berisha's stand on the war in former Yugoslavia, the 
National Assembly chairman said that sometimes "Bulgaria really 
forgets who started the war, while the whole is clear that this 
was the Serbs' aspiration to territorial aggrandizement." 
According to Mr. Yordanov, the war in former Yugoslavia was a 
natural result of the traditional nationalism in the Balkans, 
the xenophobia and ethnic intolerance which were catalyzed by 
the post-communist situation. "We should not forget that 
democratic changes in Yugoslavia are too slow and that the 
communist structures and leaders are still predominating," Mr. 
Yordanov said. 
  Asked if he expected that the closeness in the positions of 
Sofia, Skopje and Tirana would arouse fears in Belgrade and 
Athens, Mr. Yordanov said that he was convinced that Mr. 
Berisha's speech would be read very carefully both in the Greek 
and in the Serbian capitals. "No matter how other countries 
will react to Mr. Berisha's address to the Bulgarian National 
Assembly, its frankness and sincerity cannot be denied," Mr. 
Yordanov said. 
  Asked whether Bulgarian-Greek relations had soured over 
Macedonia, Mr. Yordanov said that "the Greek policy is clearly 
oriented towards Europe and that the Greeks are justified in 
certain respects to express concern over some texts in the 
Constitution of Macedonia which are inconsistent with the 
principles of the European Union member countries." Mr. 
Yordanov added that "contacts between Bulgaria and Greece are 
built on principles which matter far more than historical 
memories like, for example, integration into the European 
structures. And it is a fact that we consider Greece a country 
through which Bulgaria could practically integrate into these 
structures," the National Assembly Chairman said. 
  Mr. Yordanov said that the positions of Bulgaria and Albania 
on the inclusion of Turkish blue helmets in the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] forces in Macedonia had not been discussed. 
"I do not differentiate between Turkish, Bulgarian, American, 
Finnish, Russian or other blue helmets. I would rather prefer 
blue helmets crossing Bulgaria than green ones," Mr. Yordanov 
said. According to him, it is another matter that the presence 
of Turkish blue helmets in particular could play a destructive 
role in the territories of Bosnia-Herzegovina, where nationalism 
is extreme.

  [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- In 1993 state-controlled 
agricultural enterprises sustained losses of 3.5 billion leva, 
900 million leva more than 1992, Mrs. Lili Petrova, deputy head 
of the Economic Management Department of the Ministry of 
Agriculture, told a news conference today. According to figures 
quoted by the ministry, 64 percent of the fixed assets of 
agricultural enterprises are in machines and equipment, but a 
considerable part of them have been mortgaged. 
  The worst loss-makers in 1993 were freshwater fish-farming 
and pig-breeding, which account for more than 62 percent of the 
aggregate losses of agriculture. The flour-milling and 
animal-feed industries, seed production, and veterinary services 
were the only profitable operations. 
  The total debt of agriculture is 14.6 billion leva; 8.6 
billion of them are owed to banks, and the rest to suppliers. 
As little as 524 million leva of the loans were spent on 
investment. A shortage of current assets, impossibility to 
service bank loans and lack of investors' interest were once 
again the major problems of agriculture last year, Mrs. Petrova 
said. 
  The Agricultural Ministry sees a way out of this situation 
in 
closing down the worst loss-makers and rehabilitating the rest. 
Privatization of the enterprises is another alternative, but the 
ministry is running into difficulties with that because of their 
dire financial straits. In spite of the large debts incurred, 
the banks have not filed for the bankruptcy of agricultural 
enterprises so far, as they still expect that the public purse 
will take over the nonperforming loans. In spite of all the 
requests made by the Agricultural Ministry, the government has 
not made a decision so far on a write-off of the non-performing 
loans in the sector, Mrs. Petrova recalled.

  [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec said he considers the future to be more important than 
the past concerning Bulgaria's outstanding debt with the Czech 
Republic, after being asked today when the debt would be 
settled. In his opinion, the debt does not involve an 
exorbitant sum, and it would be important and productive for 
both countries to eliminate it and thus relieve uncertainty in 
mutual trade. Zieleniec noted that a substantial part of the 
debt was resolved last year. 
  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, who met with 
Zieleniec today in Prague, also emphasized that his country had 
done a lot to resolve debts with the former Czechoslovakia, 
Poland, and Hungary that it had inherited from the Comecon 
[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] era. "It isn't an easy 
matter, but Bulgaria is committed to upholding its international 
commitments," Daskalov said. 
  Sofia's debt burden with Czechoslovakia reached almost 1.8 
billion crowns during the days of the communist trading bloc. A 
third of the debt was resolved at the end of last year. 
  The ministers also discussed at their meeting today the 
completion of an agreement to support and protect investment, 
and spoke about launching negotiations to limit double taxation.

  [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and 
Bulgaria hold identical views on the prepared conference of the 
"Stability Pact" to take place in late May in Paris, Czech and 
Bulgarian Foreign Ministers Josef Zieleniec and Stanislav 
Daskalov told journalists today. 
  The Pact on Security and Stability in Europe was proposed by 
French Premier Edouard Balladur in June 1993. It aims to ensure 
stability and security in Europe and protect economic and trade 
interests of European countries and to end in conclusion, by its 
member states, of agreements on good neighborliness and on 
respecting ethnic minority rights. According to the French 
plan, European countries and the United States and Canada would 
be signatories of the pact. 
  Daskalov said that Bulgaria considered every initiative 
aimed 
at stability in Europe profitable. He added, however, that the 
prepared documents should put all countries on an equal footing. 
  Daskalov said that Bulgaria did not have problems either 
with 
borders or with ethnic minorities and it announced earlier that 
it would not participate in round-table discussions on these 
issues. Nevertheless it actively supports the preparation of the 
Paris conference and hopes that the submitted document would 
correspond to its interests, he added. 
  Daskalov told CTK that as far as the 800,000 Turks living in 
Bulgaria are concerned Bulgaria believes that their rights had 
been ensured in the course of last years' democratic changes. 
  In practice this issue had been successfully solved through 
attracting the Turkish population to managing of the state, he 
said. "It is important not only to demand that rights are 
observed but to share responsibility," he said. Over one 
hundred of mayors of Turkish origin had been elected during the 
latest local elections, Daskalov said. 
  Moreover, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms, the third 
strongest political party in Parliament, represented the Turkish 
minority in Parliament, Daskalov said. He pointed to the fact 
that Bulgarian Premier Lyuben Berov was a representative of this 
very movement. "I do not know whether there exists another state 
in Europe whose premier is a representative of a certain 
minority group," Daskalov said. 
  He said that Bulgaria had settled problems in this field. If 
it was not so then events similar to those in neighboring 
Yugoslavia could happened in Bulgaria. On the contrary, thanks 
to the fact that ethnic minority problems had been solved and 
thanks to its moderate internal and foreign policy Bulgaria had 
a certain stabilizing role in the Balkans, Daskalov said.

  [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- Documents from archives 
of the Bulgarian Foreign, Interior, and Defense Ministries 
concerning the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops 
in 1968 were handed over to Czech President Vaclav Havel today 
by Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. Daskalov told 
journalists after the meeting that the documents contained 
primarily an assessment of the events which preceded the 
military invasion and followed it by "former Bulgarian and 
Czechoslovak functionaries." 
  Havel said that today's act followed his earlier talks with 
Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev at which Havel showed interest 
in such documents. Part of the "national hygiene" is to know 
better one's own country's history, Havel said, adding that he 
would extend the documents to a commission of historians dealing 
with the 1968 events. 
  Daskalov pointed out that the Bulgarian Parliament had in 
1990 officially apologized to the former Czechoslovakia for 
Bulgaria's role in the events. Asked why Bulgaria was handing 
over the documents concerning 1968 only now Daskalov said that 
it was probably because in Bulgaria is more bureaucracy. 
  Havel said that his meeting with Daskalov today served as an 
opportunity for exchanging information on the current political 
situation in both countries and on prospects for mutual 
relations. He said he believed there were no political problems 
or contested issues between the Czech Republic and Bulgaria. 
The two countries hold similar views on many questions and 
orientate their foreign policy in the same direction, he added. 
  Hungary was the first country to hand over documents 
concerning the 1968 events to the former Czechoslovakia in June 
1990, six days after Czechoslovak archive documents concerning 
the 1956 Hungarian revolution were handed over to Hungary. 
  In August 1991, Czechoslovakia officially asked the former 
Soviet Union for access to the Soviet Government and party 
archives. In December 1991, Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia 
Aleksandr Lebedev handed over documents concerning the events of 
1968 and 1969 to Vojtech Mencl, chairman of the Czechoslovak 
governmental commission looking into the period. The documents 
contained reports which were sent by the then Soviet ambassador 
to Czechoslovakia to Moscow and the orders from Moscow. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin handed over two packages of 
archive materials to the then Czechoslovak President Havel 
during his visit to Moscow in April 1992. The materials came 
predominantly from the archives of the former Soviet Communist 
Party and from the KGB.

  [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- Bulgarian-Czech relations 
were appreciated as good by Czech Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde 
and visiting Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov at 
their meeting today. Uhde and Daskalov welcomed the signing of 
an agreement on cooperation between the two countries' foreign 
ministries and the fact that agreements on the prevention of 
double taxation and on investment protection were under 
preparation, Uhde told CTK after the meeting. 
  Regarding the conflict in the former Yugoslavia Daskalov 
voiced the view that tough approach towards all who violate 
peace in the region should be adopted and that the United 
States, Russia, and NATO should equally participate in solving 
the situation. Daskalov also met Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
today.

  [Text] Prague April 28 (CTK) -- Czech Finance Minister 
Ivan Kocarnik said last night he did not share Slovakia's 
optimism that the old bloc claims and liabilities between the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia were far lower than estimated by the 
Czech Industry and Trade Ministry. Speaking to journalists after 
his return from the spring session of the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, he was reacting to a statement 
made by Slovak Deputy Premier Brigita Schmognerova made during 
their meeting in Washington. 
  Schmognerova indicated that the method of settling the 
"old-bloc claims" had "still to be considered," Kocarnik said. 
He added that Schmognerova, however, did not say how the 
government wanted to solve the situation. 
  On Tuesday [26 April] Kocarnik told CTK in Washington that 
the Czech and Slovak Governments had agreed on March 25 to 
convert the liabilities into ECUs using the exchange rate in 
effect before the currency split. The claims would be 
transferred to the new bloc and the old would be abolished, he 
added. Under the old bloc, the 1-1 ratio is applied for 
payments related to trade deals concluded before the currency 
split on February 8, 1993. The new bloc uses ECUs. 
  Kocarnik also pointed out that the Czech Government had 
approved an amendment to the Czech-Slovak payments agreement to 
this effect two weeks ago. He stressed last night that it was 
in Slovakia's interest that a settlement reached as soon as 
possible because Slovakia was the loser. Both parties agreed it 
was now necessary to verify the volume of old claims and 
liabilities, he added. 
  Kocarnik pointed out that until September Slovakia's steps 
would be influenced by the elections slated to take place on 
September 30- October 1. It will therefore be difficult to 
distinguish between economic rationality and election-motivated 
politics.

  [Text] Prague April 28 (CTK) -- The real sense of the 
recent Central European summit in Litomysl, East Bohemia, was 
not in signing any declaration, but sending out "several 
important political signals very essential through their 
long-term implications," Czech President Vaclav Havel writes in 
an article published in the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY 
today. 
  Presidents of seven central European countries -- Austria, 
the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and 
Slovenia -- met in Litomysl on April 15-16. 
  Havel describes the phenomenon of Central Europe as the 
first 
of the political signs given by the meeting. "The fact of the 
summit itself, as well as the opinions expressed by the 
attending presidents made it clear that the phenomenon of 
Central Europe was still living and the participants in the 
summit claimed to belong to Central Europe," Havel writes. "The 
Central European phenomenon is far from being a subject of 
cultural historians' studies, since it is a phenomenon of our 
life experience...," he states. Central Europe evidently exists 
as a region with its own identity, interlinked through similar 
historical, cultural and social traditions, and it again plays a 
considerable role from the geopolitical point of view, as it did 
many times in history. It seems like it is again being decided 
on where it (Central Europe) will belong and what role it will 
play," Havel writes. 
  The summit also indicated what the views of the countries 
involved concerning Central Europe's position in a broader 
context were: "None of them wishes the emergence of a new 
buffer zone, an apparently neutral area between the West and the 
East (such zones usually become the first battle-fields in case 
of a confrontation), or a bridge linking somebody to somebody 
else (bridges are often places of battle and subjects of 
fighting as well)," Havel writes. 
  He also stresses that no Central European country wants to 
find itself in "Russia's sphere of influence", and have any 
"specific relations" towards Russia, mainly in the defence 
sphere. "Nobody, of course, defines themselves in contrast to 
Russia or wants to isolate Russia; on the contrary, everybody 
wants relations with this country to be the best imaginable -- 
relations based on equality, on Russia's respecting its 
partners' belonging where they want to belong," Havel states. 
  "We view Central Europe as the integral part of Europe which 
is rather inexactly called Western Europe or the West," he 
continues. "It is extremely important that Litomysl has sent out 
this joint Central European 'signal' now, when tones indicating 
-- though in a very diplomatic, veiled manner -- Russia's 
certain specific claim and interest concerning the area of its 
former satellites, are emerging in Russian foreign policy," 
Havel stresses. 
  Another signal "sent out" by the Litomysl meeting: All 
countries involved respect each other and are able to 
communicate not only at bilateral level but also jointly. "Even 
various specific neighbour controversies cannot prevent them 
from reflecting their essential interest both in good mutual 
neighbour relations and the existence of joint interests," Havel 
writes, adding that this is "considerable" with the Central 
European region whose ethnic structure is so complicated and 
which was so many times in the past politically divided and 
internally antagonised. 
  Moreover, discussion based on equality between 
representatives of five postcommunist countries, one influential 
member of the European Union (EU) and NATO, and one EU potential 
member indicates a certain historical shift: It is no longer a 
meeting of only postcommunist countries aimed to discuss tactics 
against the West, ...but a meeting which does not accent the 
communist past of some participants and the democratic past of 
the others, "a meeting of countries claiming to adhere to a 
specific historical and cultural region and to the same basic 
political values," Havel states. 
  The summit also made it clear that neither our "application 
to Western Europe meant our application to a sort of German 
sphere of influence, nor Germany's interest in stability, 
security and the development of its Eastern neighbours meant a 
latent building of a sphere of the German interest in power," 
Havel emphasises. At the meeting, German President Richard von 
Weizsacker "strived almost anxiously" to make it clear that in 
intensively supporting the integration of its eastern neighbours 
into European structures, Germany wanted to contribute to the 
common interest, to support the interest of its eastern 
neighbours, the EU and NATO -- simply the interests of the whole 
of Europe, not to pursue power interests of its own, Havel 
writes. "Briefly: Germany neither is nor wants to be a patron 
of Central Europe, nor somebody separating us from the liberal 
West, but on the contrary, the one to link us with the West most 
markedly of all," Havel stresses. 
  The summit has also indicated which values ranked among 
those 
linking us to the West, such as democracy, market economy, law- 
abiding state, and mainly the civic principle in the building of 
the state, the civic society. The civic orientation is the only 
one to "lead us forever out of the darkness of nationalist 
thick- headedness, which is the source of endless human 
suffering. Our application to Europe is therefore an 
application to the coexistence of nations, nationalities and 
ethnic groups on the principle of equality. "Maybe it could be 
said that the quicker the pace of Central Europeans on this path 
would be, the quicker the idea of tolerance and solidarity would 
spread further to the south and east of Europe," Havel writes. 
  Good personal relations and real friendship between 
politicians are more important in politics than they seem to be 
when observed from outside, he writes, adding that the "human 
dimension of politics" characteristic of the Litomysl talks, was 
of priceless benefit to all the attending countries. 
  It seems the Litomysl summit will not be the last meeting of 
this sort, as presidents of the seven involved countries would 
meet regularly. No emergence of a new international pact can be 
expected. "But if this becomes a certain tradition, it will 
undoubtedly be another instrument for the creation of a good 
atmosphere in Europe," Havel concludes.

  [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- The activity of Austrian 
politicians concerning the completion of the Temelin nuclear 
power plant in south Bohemia should not be seen as a threat to 
or violation of the Czech Republic's sovereignty, Czech Premier 
Vaclav Klaus told Parliament today. 
  He said steps taken on the issue by some Austrian 
politicians 
should not serve as a reason for the Czech diplomacy to resort 
to resolute actions the consequences of which might hamper the 
Czech Republic's relations with Austria. 
  Czech-Austrian relations in the power industry are defined 
by 
a Czech-Austrian agreement on nuclear security and protection 
against radiation. According to the agreement, experts from 
both countries meet annually and Austrian representatives are 
informed on all Czech goals concerning the use of nuclear power.

  [Text] Prague April 28 (CTK) -- Ivan Pilip, Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS) chairman and first deputy education 
minister, who was yesterday nominated by his party for the post 
of education minister to replace Petr Pitha, was born in Prague 
in 1963. Pitha, who handed in his resignation for health 
reasons yesterday, is also a KDS member. In line with the 
coalition agreements the post belongs to the party. 
  Pilip is a graduate of the Prague School of Economics (VSE) 
where he majored in international economics and trade. He then 
worked at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and VSE. After 
restitution of family property near Tabor, South Bohemia, in the 
wake of the fall of the communist regime in November 1989, he 
was placed at the head of a medical equipment factory employing 
80 people. Since August 1992 he has held the post of deputy 
education minister (since February 1993 first deputy). 
  Pilip entered political life after November 1989. Before he 
had been neither a member nor a candidate for membership of any 
party. He became a member of the KDS shortly after it was formed 
in 1990. In December 1993 he was elected the party chairman, 
replacing Vaclav Benda. Now the government coalition party has 
10 out of the total of 200 seats in the parliament. 
  Pilip's wife Lucie was Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, but 
left 
the post after her husband became the KDS chairman to avoid a 
conflict of interests. At present she is an executive director 
of the Bohemiae Foundation. 
  Pilip knew Pitha before November 1989 from the Independent 
Intellectuals Group. After Pitha became education minister he 
offered Pilip a position in a ministerial team in charge of 
economic and conceptual issues. 
  Pitha was born in 1938. He graduated from the Philosophical 
Faculty of Prague's Charles University where he studied Czech, 
general linguistics and history. He also studied mathematical 
linguistics at the Mathematical-Physical Faculty of Charles 
University. Privately he studied theology and was regularly 
ordained priest in the Netherlands in 1969. 
  His main task at the ministry was transformation of 
education, but his proposals have been criticised by both the 
coalition parties and the opposition. 
  On March 28, 1994, education trade unions called a protest 
rally against the proposed changes in the management and funds 
distribution at schools. Pitha also came to the rally which he 
commented later: "I do not know what the meeting was about and 
even after my return from Old Town Square (where it was held) I 
was no wiser." 
  After a government session yesterday, Premier Vaclav Klaus 
said that Pitha "has done more than it might seem from the 
skirmishes in the parliamentary Education Committee or from 
media reports." He added that with his humane and prudent 
handling of problems, he will be missed at government sessions. 
  Pitha is the third minister to leave his post early. The 
other two were Health Minister Petr Lom (Civic Democratic Party, 
ODS) and Culture Minister Jindrich Kabat (Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL). Both of them were 
strongly criticised for their performance in transforming their 
respective spheres of social life. 
  The present government emerged from the June 1992 elections.

  [Text] Prague, April 27 (CTK) -- At its meeting today, the 
Czech Government discussed and approved the principles for a 
constitutional bill on higher self-administrative units to be 
submitted to Parliament by April 30, Premier Vaclav Klaus told 
journalists. 
  He said the government had thoroughly reworked and regrouped 
the materials. The first part concerns general powers of higher 
administrative units while the second one defines which powers 
would be transferred to higher administrative units from central 
bodies, Klaus said. The third part specifies areas where the 
higher units would have the right to set up institutions. These 
would include social care, education, health care, transport, 
culture, and the environment, he said. 
  Klaus said that the approved principles would "facilitate 
the 
next stage of the work on the future administrative arrangement 
of the state."

  [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- Czech Environment 
Minister Frantisek Benda told journalists today that his 
ministry might submit its own mining bill which would put an 
emphasis on environmental protection. He said the Environment 
Ministry's idea of the bill differed considerably from that of 
the Ministry of the Economy. Both ministries had been charged 
with the joint preparation of the principles for the bill. 
  At the beginning of the year Benda pointed out that the 
Environment Ministry would seek to include all important aspects 
concerning the protection of the mining environment in the 
initial bill drawn up by the Economy Ministry. He said today 
that the two bills have just joined together, whereas he had 
expected that a single bill would be drafted. A completely 
unacceptable situation arose in which about "ten diametrically 
opposed views" stand against each other. 
  Disputes between the ministries concerned, for example, the 
definition of public interest which had been defined very 
liberally and on a low level as regards the protection of 
owners' rights or the protection of the environment or mining 
site, Benda said. The two ministries are using the same words 
but their notions are different, he said.

  [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- The time has come to 
demand early parliamentary elections, since the results of the 
last elections (held in June 1992) are, according to the 
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), steadily being 
challenged, KSCM Deputy Chairman Zdenek Klanica told journalists 
today. 
  The KSCM believes that after modification by the 
parliamentary budgetary committee, the draft amendment to the 
law on political parties, which is now being discussed in 
parliament, entirely ignores the results of the June 1992 
elections. KSCM Chairman Miroslav Grebenicek said that the 
ruling right-wing parties, along with some opposition parties, 
wanted the amendment to weaken mainly the KSCM. "Those who 
support the amendment in its present form, will be well paid by 
right-wing parties for their accommodating move," Grebenicek 
added. 
  Vojtech Filip, a KSCM expert on legislation, criticized the 
efforts to ban political parties from running any businesses, 
and described them as attempts to impair the "constitutional 
equality of all forms of property". Parties should be allowed 
to at least edit and publish, Filip said. 
  He added he was convinced that the aim of the discussed 
amendment was mainly to restrict funding of the KSCM and weaken 
it in the forthcoming local and Senate elections. 
  Grebenicek said that in the elections, the KSCM would be 
also 
paralyzed by a ban on editing activities, as it would cause it 
difficulties with the printing of advertisements during the 
pre-election campaign. In contrast to this, the right-wing 
parties would remain intact, as they "have a considerable 
majority of the media at their disposal, and their 
representatives have enough financial opportunities to publish 
any documents," Grebenicek said.

  [Text] Prague, April 28 (CTK) -- The export of 
non-renewable resources and products which have not been very 
highly processed made up 32 percent of overall Czech exports, a 
fact which Environmental Minister Frantisek Benda considers 
alarming, he said at a press conference of the Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS) today. Benda commented that practically 
no government policy for raw materials was in existence. 
  Concerning the Temelin nuclear power plant, the minister 
said 
he thought it essential that an atomic code be created which 
would include the atomic law as well as other laws concerning 
nuclear power. The code would primarily concern legal 
regulations for the storage of nuclear waste or the 
establishment of a fund for the disposal of nuclear equipment. 
  The ministry has completed a document entitled "Government 
Environmental Policy" which the government received last 
December as an outline proposal for the activities of the 
Environment Ministry. After being discussed by 
inter-governmental agencies, the document will be presented to 
the government. The ministry included in its outline an 
environmental action program which includes short term programs 
of about three years in duration.

  [Text] Prague April 28 (CTK) -- Thirty-six percent and 29 
percent of Czechs respectively consider themselves right or 
centre- orientated, a poll conducted by the Institute for Public 
Opinion Research (IVVM) at the turn of April revealed. Five 
percent of Czechs are on the extreme right, 18 percent on the 
left and one percent on the extreme left, the poll showed. 
  The average rating (on a scale from 1 for the extreme left 
to 
7 for the extreme right) is 4.47, slightly less than in March 
(4.47) [as received], but still more than in November (4.38). 
  The right-wing orientation is most noticeable among Praguers 
(4.69), students (4.94), people under 29 (4.81) and people with 
tertiary education (4.72). Farmers (3.93) and the elderly 
(people over sixty, 3.98) are at the opposite pole of the 
political spectrum.

  [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- Leaders of the 
newly-founded Hungarist Movement (HM) applied for registration 
at Budapest Metropolitan Court on April 25, but they insist that 
they regard themselves as an existing organization, irrespective 
of the court's decision, journalists were told in Budapest on 
Wednesday [27 April]. The movement was set up by leaders of the 
"Federation of Persecutees of Communism", the Hungarian National 
Front, and the World National Popular Rule Party: Gyorgy Ekrem 
Kemal, Istvan Gyorkos, and Albert Szabo, respectively. 
  The three HM co-presidents said they identify at least 
partly 
with the ideas of Ferenc Szalasi's arrow-cross party. At the 
news conference, Szabo called Szalasi an ideal of Hungarian 
youth. 
  (Szalasi -- 1897-1946 -- led the Hungarian arrow-cross 
party-Hungarist movement. Hitler helped him to power on October 
15, 1944, and he introduced a reign of fascist terror in the 
country. The Hungarian people's court sentenced him to death as 
a war-criminal, in 1946.) 
  According to Istvan Gyorkos, the Hungarist Movement had to 
be 
founded to counter strengthening left-wing influence, because 
the national parties have made a compromise and fail to 
represent the nation's interests. He said the court must 
acknowledge their movement if it registered the Zionist 
Federation and the Masonic Lodges. 
  In response to questions from the press, Gyorkos insisted 
that Hungarism was not responsible for the Holocaust, because in 
1944 the arrow-cross party controlled only a few counties in 
Transdanubia, and he claims it was the Hungarists who prevented 
Jews in the Budapest ghetto from being deported. 
  The movement currently has about 500 members and many 
sympathizers, HM leaders informed the press.

  [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- The presidium of the 
ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) voiced its satisfaction 
in Budapest today that most political parties conduct their 
election campaigns according to European norms, disproving fears 
of the campaign becoming dirty, MDF spokesman Karoly Herenyi 
told a news conference after the presidium session. Answering 
questions from the press, Herenyi denied that his party is 
carrying on a negative campaign. 
  Herenyi also said the MDF is "deeply indignant" at attempts 
to revive the fascist arrow-cross and Hungarist movement. The 
MDF presidium has called upon the state prosecutors office to do 
all it can to ban these organizations. At the same time, the 
presidium also cautioned against the resurgence of the extreme 
left. 
  Herenyi said the presidium has learnt from local MDF 
organizations that groupings even more extreme than the Workers' 
Party, such as members of the former Workers' Militia, hold 
regular meetings, disturbing and intimidating people in many 
places.

  [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian Justice 
and Life Party (MIEP) considers the Hungarist Movement, its 
leaders, and particularly their statements declaring sympathy 
for the MIEP, to be clear provocations, said MIEP Co-Chairman 
Istvan Csurka at the party's press conference in Budapest on 
Thursday [28 April]. Csurka sees this as a dirty political 
trick, and said the organization is backed by forces who are 
interested in presenting the MIEP as an extreme rightist party. 
  As reported on Wednesday [27 April], leaders of the 
Hungarist 
Movement, which openly professes extreme rightist ideas, held a 
press conference in Budapest. Present were the chairmen of the 
three political groups that set up the movement: the Federation 
of Persecutees of Communism, the Hungarian National Front, and 
the World National Popular Rule Party. 
  National Front head, Istvan Gyorkos, announced at 
yesterday's 
press conference that the Hungarist program coincides with that 
of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party at several points.

  [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- Outraged Hungarian 
Prime Minister Peter Boross on Thursday [28 April] told 
journalists the emerging organization of the Hungarist (fascist) 
Movement reminded everyone how Hungary was twice this century 
betrayed, by the Hungarian Arrow Cross-Hungarist Movement in 
1944, and by the Communists in 1945. Both times, the country 
was handed over to alien powers. 
  Organizations that caused national tragedies have no place 
in 
Hungarian public life, he went on. Although outrage was 
considerable, this should not mean over-evaluating the 
organization's political weight. 
  Unless the organization commits a specific crime then Boross 
saw it as a Public Prosecutor's Office matter. He said both the 
extreme right and the extreme left should be seen as equally 
dangerous. 
  Discussing the chances of the left-wing at the elections, 
Boross said victory by the Socialists would imply trouble: "We 
have already experienced their professionalism and 
decision-making ability." 
  Boross said governing in a transition period implies 
unpopular measures. Restructuring comes with sacrifice and 
loss, and many people have become disillusioned, even with a 
government which has, uniquely in the region, served all four 
years in office. But, the Hungarian election system 
disadvantages non-left-wing parties, as the center and 
center-right are sharply divided.

  [Text] Budapest, 29 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian National 
Police Headquarters (ORFK) and the National Security Office 
launched joint legal proceedings against two founders and 
current leaders of the Hungarist Movement on Thursday [28 
April], the ORFK told MTI this morning. Albert Szabo, a 
39-year-old Australian-Hungarian citizen and Istvan Gyorkos, a 
54-year-old Hungarian citizen were taken into custody and now 
face trial for anti-community incitement. 
  As reported by MTI on Thursday, the Hungarist Movement (HM), 
which was founded recently by the leaders of the Federation of 
Persecutees of Communism, the Hungarian National Front, and the 
World National Popular Rule Party, held a news conference on 
Wednesday. 
  Co-Presidents Gyorgy Ekrem Kemal, Istvan Gyorkos, and Albert 
Szabo informed the journalists that they had applied for 
registration at the Budapest Metropolitan Court on April 25. 
They claimed partial identification with the arrow cross 
party's Hungarist movement, which rose to power in 1944 under 
the leadership of Ferenc Szalasi (1897-1946). (Szalasi was 
sentenced to death as a war-criminal in 1946.) 
  At a Thursday press conference, Prime Minister Peter Boross 
condemned the new movement on behalf of the government and of 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum.

  [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF) does not wish to deceive voters, which is 
why it clearly states the political forces with which it 
definitely does not wish to enter into a coalition, under any 
circumstances, Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross, deputy 
chairman of the MDF, said on Thursday [28 April], at an election 
rally held in Budapest. 
  Among these forces, Boross mentioned the Hungarian Socialist 
Party (MSZP) in the first place, and said the Socialists 
themselves had firmly ruled out the MDF a few days ago. The MDF 
also does not want to enter into a coalition with an Alliance of 
Free Democrats (SZDSZ) that is directed by the SZDSZ's strong 
core in Budapest, and which is moving closer to its one-time 
enemy, the former communists (the MSZP), Boross said. 
  The prime minister discussed in detail farming and industry. 
He also said that debt servicing, and external circumstances 
such as the collapse of the Soviet Union and its insolvency, the 
global recession, and the Balkan war have held Hungary back, 
falling short of results hoped for in the MDF's 1990 program.

  [Text] Budapest, 26 April (MTI) -- According to the 
chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz), Viktor 
Orban, there will be no coalition agreement between the 
Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ), and all guesses of this kind are provocations 
by the MSZP. Orban made the remarks at a rally held in Budapest 
on Tuesday [26 April]. 
  The Fidesz chairman's firm position is interesting in light 
of the fact that numerous conjectures have appeared in press in 
the past weeks, whereby the liberal SZDSZ and the Socialists 
would reach agreement and enter into coalition. As four liberal 
parties -- Fidesz, SZDSZ, Agrarian Federation, and 
Entrepreneurs' Party -- have already formed an election 
alliance, a possible agreement between the SZDSZ and the MSZP 
would question this agreement. 
  Reacting to the guesses so far, several Fidesz leaders have 
firmly stated they are not willing to cooperate with the MSZP. 
"In order for the SZDSZ to agree with the MSZP, they would have 
to betray us first," Orban said. 
  According to Orban, the MSZP is not in the favorable 
position 
it presents itself to be. He predicted that the alleged 
advantage of the MSZP will further dwindle in the remaining 
period of the election campaign.

  [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- After tough internal 
squabbles, the Democratic Hungarian Community of Vojvodina 
(VMDK) has been consolidated, with its realistic line winning a 
two-thirds majority, VMDK president Andras Agoston announced in 
Budapest on Thursday [28 April] after meeting government 
representatives and party officials. Cross-Border Hungarians 
Office President Geza Entz said their talks covered a proposal 
for ethnic Hungarian organizations to receive certain 
contribution to their budgets. 
  Agoston said the VMDK's re-elected leadership maintains its 
demand for autonomy, and has already talked unofficially to 
Serbia's prime minister. Settling the position of Hungarians in 
Vojvodina is closely connected with international circumstances. 
"An agreement with Serbia will work if it also serves Serb 
interests," he added. 
  He quoted President Clinton's special emissary's call for 
autonomy for Croatian Serbs and Albanians in rump Yugoslavia. 
With a precedent for ethnic minority autonomy, Hungarians in 
Vojvodina would have more chance for their own demands, Agoston 
said.

  [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky at a Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) 
election rally in Budapest's Obuda district on Thursday evening 
[28 April], said that the MDF had said in 1989 that Hungary 
wanted to return to the European road, and had asked for the 
world's support. "Experience shows that although Hungary does 
get help from the West, we have to adapt mainly on our own," 
Jeszenszky said. 
  Jeszenszky said Hungary fosters excellent relations with 
four 
of its neighbors: Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Ukraine. 
With good political relations, the rights of minorities are 
also regulated by exemplary contracts. 
  Links with three other states -- Slovakia, Romania, and 
Serbia -- are not satisfactory. In this context, Jeszenszky 
said Hungarian diplomacy encourages democratic rights for the 
Hungarian national minorities living in those countries, in line 
with European principles.

deficit of $757.2 million in the first three months of 1994, 
with exports amounting to $2,159.2 million and imports totalling 
$2,916.4 million, according to the Ministry of International

  In the first three months of the year, exports were up 4.1 
percent and imports were up 9.2 percent on the same period of 
the previous year. According to preliminary figures from the 
ministry, exports amounted to $610.7 million in January, $776.5 
million in February and $772.1 million in March. The figures 
are up 2.8 percent and 15.3 percent in the first two months 
respectively and down 4.3 percent for March, compared to the 
same months of 1993. The preliminary figure for March is likely 
to be corrected as further customs statistics come in. Imports 
amounted to $897.8 million in January, $958.1 million in 
February and $1,060.5 million in March. The figures are 22.2 
percent, 5.7 percent and 2.9 percent up respectively on the same 
months of 1993. Compared to total exports in the first quarter 
of $2,159.2 million, exports in the third quarter of 1993 
amounted to $2,165.9 million, down 21 percent. In the fourth 
quarter, exports were $2,464.2 million, down 9.5 percent on the 
same figure for the previous year. Exports totalled $8,906.9 
million in 1993, 16.8 percent down on 1992. Imports in the 
first quarter of 1994 exceeded the same figure for the previous 
year by 9.2 percent, amounting to $2,916.4 million. This can be 
compared to $2,709.3 million in the third quarter of 1993 (3.6 
percent up on the same period of the previous year) and $3,826.3 
million in the fourth quarter (30.3 percent up on the same 
period of 1992). 
  Imports totalled $12,530.3 million last year, 13.2 percent 
up 
on 1992. The country's foreign trade performance shows that the 
period of decline or stagnation is over and that the economy is 
facing a time of recovery. The increase in exports over the 
first quarter of 1993 was more or less equally shared by the 
main product groups, within which exports of farm and food 
products increased by 6 percent, slightly more than the average. 
Imports increased by $245 million in the first quarter of 1994 
over the same period of 1993. This includes increases of about 
$157 million in imports of machinery, $45 million in imports of 
farm and food products, $20 million in imports of raw materials, 
and $30 million in imports of consumer goods. 
  Roughly 50 percent of the increase in the amount of 
machinery 
imported can be attributed to the arrival of a Ukrainian 
aircraft for maintenance and servicing. The plane has now been 
returned to the Ukraine, and this is reflected in export 
statistics for the first quarter. The ministry estimates that 
of the remaining increase of more than $70 million, the bulk is 
imports of components, with the rest imports of investment 
goods. 80 percent of total exports went to only 10 countries. 
Two-thirds of exports went to five trading partners, Germany, 
the countries of the former Soviet Union, Austria, Italy, and 
the United States. Hungary's exports to the United States and 
Britain grew by more than 30 percent in the first quarter 
compared to the same period of last year. This was the result 
of the beginnings of economic recovery in these two countries. 
As a result of the Central European Free Trade Agreement 
(CEFTA), exports to the Czech Republic and Slovakia together 
were up 30 percent, with exports to Poland up 18 percent. 
Exports to Slovenia grew by 84.8 percent, with that country 
gaining a 2 percent share of total exports. Exports to OECD and 
EU countries grew by 4.3 percent and 4.2 percent respectively, 
in line with the average increase. Imports from the two groups 
of countries were up 7.1 percent and 13.3 percent respectively. 
Exports to the former socialist countries grew by 7.6 percent, 
while imports were up 14.5 percent. Within this, exports to the 
countries of the former Soviet Union were up 11.4 percent and 
imports were up 17.7 percent.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 26 -- Dariusz Rosati, the ruling 
coalition's candidate for the post of deputy prime minister and 
finance minister, on Tuesday resigned from seeking the posts. 
Rosati was to have filled the posts after his predecessor, 
Marek Borowski resigned a few weeks ago, but President Lech 
Walesa refused to accept him. 
  In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and 
leader of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) Aleksander 
Kwasniewski Rosati wrote that "another candidate should be 
sought urgently, one that would win support of the coalition and 
the president." 
  Rosati firmly rejected the arguments raised against his 
candidature by "the president and his representatives," but is 
of the opinion that the course of political developments in 
Poland over the past month indicates ever more clearly that the 
coalition is unable to persuade Walesa to approve him as a 
candidate for the posts of deputy prime minister and finance 
minister. Efficient performance of these functions would be 
"very difficult in the conditions of a lack of approval on the 
part of the Belvedere." 
  Rosati thinks that it is in the interest of the country to 
urgently seek another candidate for the vacant posts. 
"Energetic actions to this end are necessary in face of ever 
more visible symptoms that the economic and social situation in 
the country is getting destabilised," Rosati wrote.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 29 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
presented to the Sejm on Friday some positive trends that 
surfaced in the Polish economy in the first quarter of 1994. He 
mentioned, among other things, a 15 per cent growth in real 
budget revenues as well as a growth of hard currency reserves 
and stressed that if these positive trends prevailed it would 
mean that Poland was coming out of recession faster than the 
industrialized countries of Western Europe. 
  Simultaneously, Pawlak pointed out that good economic 
results 
can be wasted due to excessive consumption and economic 
disorganization. He stressed in this context that strikes in the 
power generating sector increased the production costs. 
  The prime minister declared that the government has always 
intended to abandon administrative methods of controlling wages 
but too much haste was connected with the risk of higher 
inflation.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 28 -- The first quarter of 1994 saw 
the consolidation of production growth trend which started 
almost two years ago, according to the central Statistical 
Office GUS. Its Vice-President Roman Sawinski told reporters 
Thursday that a growing economic activity in the first quarter 
was accompanied by lower inflation and stabilization in the 
labour market. 
  Moreover, the financial situation of enterprises improved 
which contributed to higher tax revenues of the state budget. 
  On the other hand, long-term unemployment increased, as did 
the number of people who lost their right to unemployment 
benefits, and the scale of joblessness among young adults 
widened, the GUS reports indicate. 
  After a relatively moderate wage growth recorded in January 
and February, March saw an increase of 14.8 percent on February. 
  The main trends in the Polish foreign trade in 1993 were a 
bigger deficit, growing imports, higher turnover with the 
European Union [EU] countries, and low level of trade with the 
East and Central European states. 
  Presenting the picture of Polish trade with foreign 
countries 
in 1993, Malgorzata Fronk of GUS said that exports reached over 
14 bn dollars, and imports -- over 19 bn dollars, leaving a 
trade gap of some 5 bn dollars, a twofold increase on 1992. 
  Much of the higher imports resulted from increased purchases 
of capital goods and production inputs. Compared to 1992, 
imports of chemicals increased by 46 percent, of machinery - by 
44 percent, of wood and paper products - by 42 percent, said 
Fronk. The share in overall imports of fuels and energy and of 
foodstuffs fell. 
  The share of the EU in Polish exports reached 63 percent, 
and 
in imports - 57 percent. Germany remained the largest trade 
partner for Poland. The largest trade deficit Poland had with 
Italy (728 m dollars) and Britain (475 m dollars). Trade with 
the East-Central European countries grew by 20 percent in 
exports and 25 percent in imports. Russia remained the largest 
trade partner in this area.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 26 -- The Cabinet meeting on Monday 
accepted the programme for commercialising state enterprises 
prepared by the Privatisation Ministry. "In two to three weeks 
the ministry intends to prepare draft bills connected with the 
programme, the implementation of which should begin at the start 
of 1995," Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek said. He 
added that he was referring among other things to a new version 
of a law on privatisation which would take commercialisation 
into account. 
  The commercialisation programme aims to gradually convert 
state firms into treasury owned companies. The first firms to 
be involved in the programme would be those which were in a good 
financial state (some 2,000 of Polands 5,300 state firms). 
  Overall the programme is aimed at state enterprises which it 
is impossible to privatise quickly due to their legal or 
financial situation. The Central Statistical Office (GUS) has 
announced its plans to draw up a map grading all the state 
enterprises in Poland. 
  The programme intends to regulate the legal status of the 
enterprises to take into account questions of ownership. It 
also seeks to improve supervision over the enterprises, 
including health and safety supervision, allow for more 
efficient debt repayment, help to actively fight unemployment 
and allow the transfer of state enterprise recreation assets to 
trade unions, says the government communique issued after the 
meeting. 
  In addition the programme is to make enterprises maintain 
the 
parts of their property which are not directly involved in 
production and allow the unions to manage the welfare funds. 
  The Cabinet amended the ordinance of April 19, 1993 
concerning those enterprises which were to be treated as special 
cases in the privatisation programme. The proposed amendments 
want to add enterprises in the defence industry to the list. 
The amendment should speed up the conversion of the defence 
industry enterprises into treasury owned companies.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 26/4/1994 -- Romanian 
participants in the Bucharest Crans Montana Forum generally 
shared the opinion, emphasized in statements to ROMPRES, that 
the meeting, very well organized, offered an excellent 
opportunity to debate political and economic issues of general 
interest. 
  Mircea Cosea, minister of state, president of the Council of 
Economic Coordination, Strategy, and Reform: 
  "I see the forum as a success. I think the forum is very 
important for three reasons: It has greatly contributed first 
to a change in the Romanians' manner of getting in touch with 
foreigners. Then, it has been rather large. There have been a 
great many companies, banks, and international companies 
interested in the way how one can invest, in what domains and 
priorities. There are a few proposals for the setting up of 
banks and many interests in oil processing, chemistry, 
agriculture, and, particularly, in the infrastructure and 
development of services. Third, Bucharest has arrested 
international attention again. It is an event that has called 
attention to us again. We have proved we do have facilities to 
organize international meetings." 
  Teodor Melescanu, Romanian foreign minister: 
  "This year's Crans Montana Forum was a meeting of European 
standing in a European country and I am very pleased with its 
organization and results as concerns Romania's image, in the 
political and economic domains." 
  ``The possibility we have taken advantage of in order to 
demonstrate that our country can be a bridge between Europe and 
several zones confronted with big issues -- the Middle East, 
ex-Yugoslavia, Central Asia -- has not been wasted. 
  ``Also, understandings of economic collaboration were 
concluded, inter-state relations were established, and these are 
the concrete results of the Bucharest meeting. 
  ``On an internal plane, it has been an opportunity to 
demonstrate the Romanians' big possibilities to gather their 
energies when needed.'' 
  Emil Constantinescu, president of the Democratic Convention 
of Romania, an opposition coalition of Romania: 
``This event has been first of all meant, I think, to improve 
Romania's image abroad which -- as we all know -- is negative, 
and to sustain the idea that Romania is apt to ensure the 
holding of an international conference at a Western standing. 
And I think it has succeeded in their respect. 
  ``I have noticed two tendencies: One to exaggerate the 
formal facet, based on pomp and formalism and which belongs 
especially to the Romanian organizers, in the well-known 
traditions, and, on the other hand, the tendency of the Swiss 
organizers of the Crans Montana Forum, who wanted to ensure the 
climate of informal events and meetings, in which the sincere, 
open talks are prevalent. Contingent upon the relation between 
these tendencies, we can expect the consequences. Sure, if 
important was only this protocol, then, it might be termed 
easily as having used for propaganda purposes the presence of 
many political VIPs in order to credit the current power with 
successes, especially for domestic use. The second tendency, 
however, could have substantiated something more serious and I 
think it has done so partly, that is, direct and facilitate 
concrete contacts'' 
  National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca: 
  ``I have a rather long experience as regards the 
participation in international meetings. So, I can say that 
those who do not have such experience could have been a little 
disappointed to see that concrete problems have not been settled. 
  ``But meetings of this kind are not expected to settle 
issues 
right away. However, this stage of talks, probing, pioneering 
in some domains is absolutely necessary and it happens prior to 
the settlement of the respective specific issues. 
  ``In this respect, the Crans Montana Forum in Bucharest, by 
its inspired theme `The Emerging Markets,' by the conditions of 
organization and especially by participation, has helped in the 
efforts Romania is making to tear down in a certain way the 
unnatural psychological barrier and also to join in the flow of 
ideas and values.'' 
  Napoleon Pop, state secretary, head of the European 
Integration Department: 
  ``This forum usually covers a wider area, not only one 
direction, and it has always happened so because the efforts for 
integration cannot be separated from what is happening as global 
phenomena in this world. Also, you have noted that the forum 
has pursued and emphasized precisely certain directions with 
which Romania is willy-nilly connected: the Middle East 
conflict, the conflict in ex-Yugoslavia, the Balkans 
cooperation, the relations with the European Union, and the 
regional cooperation. All of them major themes of great 
interest to Romania. The decision for integration and all our 
efforts in this respect cannot be isolated from what is 
happening around us.'' 
  Viorel Salagean, Romanian National Unity Party senator, 
member of the Senate Commission for Privatization: 
  ``The Crans Montana Forum conference has definitely been a 
gain for the country, for the Romanian political class, and for 
businessmen, both Romanian and foreign, present here. 
  ``I am sure to many of the foreign guests who have been in 
Romania for the first time now and who have participated in the 
forum, it has been a great surprise. 
  ``I have noticed many concrete contacts and, what is even 
more important, foreign businessmen have had contacts with 
Romanian politicians and cabinet members.'' 
  Aurel Ghibutiu, president of the Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry: 
  ``For the international business circles, the Bucharest 
forum 
has been a unique opportunity to meet and start advantageous 
collaboration actions. 
  ``For four days both in an organized framework and in the 
lobbies of the Parliament Palace, talks were conducted with 
businessmen from Romania and from a big number of countries, in 
Asia and eastern Europe. I have seen their full satisfaction at 
the opportunity they have had in Bucharest to establish contacts. 
  ``The consequences will show up soon. We have already 
prepared a number of missions to go to several countries and 
materialize the talks conducted in Bucharest. So, I believe 
Romania has made a remunerative investment the results of which 
will be obvious very soon.'' 
  Dan Matei Agaton, minister of tourism: 
  "It is very difficult to appraise the immediate effects. 
Anyway, we have launched a new form of tourism -- tourism for 
conference purposes and I think we have launched it at a 
European level. So, I am sure we are able to organize any time 
any international meeting, at whatever level. I think it has 
been a test for everything tourism at top level means in 
Romania. Since the World Population Congress, held in the '70s, 
our country has not organized another event of such a wide 
scale. The travel companies have been directly involved. I 
think the test has been passed successfully. We are waiting now 
for the reactions of the others. I am sure the image of 
Romanian tourism will change for the better."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 25/4/1994 -- The prime 
ministers of Romania, Nicolae Vacaroiu, and of the Great Duchy 
of Luxembourg, Jacques Santer, agreed in the talks they had 
Monday, 25 April, on the need that the two countries extended 
their bilateral cooperation, with a stress on the economic side. 
The three-day visit to Romania of the delegation led by Premier 
Santer is the first at this level since the two countries 
established diplomatic ties in 1910. 
  Premier Vacaroiu communicated to his Luxembourg counterpart 
his cabinet's surprise to find out that Romania was left out of 
the community's crediting programmes for the development of 
infrastructure networks and requested Luxembourg to help Romania 
get access to such credit lines. Mr. Vacaroiu also asked for 
Luxembourg's help, as acting president of the Western European 
Union, for a non-discriminatory treatment by that body. The 
Romanian prime minister also found useful for the sides the idea 
of a joint bank to assist business people in both countries. 
  Prime Minister Santer promised to sustain closer business 
and 
financial ties with Romania, not only at a country-to-country 
level, but also at the level of the European Investment Bank and 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in his 
capacity of governor and chief of the exchequer. These bodies 
should take, in his opinion, a more active part in financing 
Romania's air and seaport projects and energy development 
schemes, and said his country perfectly understood the adequacy 
of non-discriminatory treatment of Romania in both the Council 
of Europe and the Western European Union. 
  The prime minister of Romania asked his guest to convey the 
grand duke of Luxembourg the invitation to visit Romania. In 
his turn, Premier Santer invited his Romanian counterpart to be 
the guest of Luxembourg, an invitation readily accepted.

  [Text] Bratislava April 28 (CTK) -- The pressure exerted 
by the opposition on parliament to dismiss Deputy Premier Roman 
Kovac is increasing. The dismissal was proposed on Wednesday 
[27 April] by Dusan Masiar, a deputy for the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), who is supported by 35 deputies. 
The opposition accuses Kovac of being incompetent both as 
deputy premier and from the moral point of view, and of 
corruption attempts. 
  Peter Sokol, adviser to the opposition Slovak National Party 
(SNS) said at a SNS press conference today that Kovac was 
morally incompetent mainly due to his previous "commitment". As 
deputy premier in the previous government of ex-Premier Vladimir 
Meciar, Roman Kovac was one of the protagonists of the then 
coalition agreement between the HZDS and the SNS, Sokol said. 
  According to Sokol, Kovac pushed for the joint of his post 
of 
vice-premier with the seat of health minister, and promoted 
himself to this post. 
  Parliamentary deputies refused to include the proposal to 
dismiss Roman Kovac into the agenda of the parliamentary 
session. However, Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic (HZDS) 
announced he would convoke an extraordinary session to discuss 
this point immediately after the end of the current regular 
session. 
  SNS leaders also criticised former SNS leader and present 
chairman of the National Democratic Party-New Alternative 
Ludovit Cernak.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 28 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik admitted today to the existence of "working tension" in 
the government where privatization issues were concerned. 
However, he told journalists, the government's capacity for 
action was thorn-free. "This tension has a working nature only," 
he stressed, asked about relations between Privatization 
Minister Milan Janicina and Economy Minister Petr Magvasi. 
  Janicina favors the rapid transfer of state property into 
private hands, chiefly by means of the coupon privatization 
method, while Magvasi, a Democratic Left Party (SDL) candidate, 
is for standard methods. In the background of the dispute, 
however, can be felt the influence of the left-wing in the 
leadership of state companies and that of the right in the 
privatization funds. 
  Moravcik admitted that the privatization funds and the large 
state companies were a factor in privatization policy, but said 
he would not be inclined to directly relate the conflict of 
these interests to the relations between Ministers Magvasi and 
Janicina. 
  The government has not yet made a definitive decision on how 
much of the state property, valued at over 200 billion crowns 
($6.6 billion), would be privatized by the coupon method, which 
could gain votes before the autumn elections. At present a 
media debate is going on between supporters and opponents of the 
method. 
  Asked whether the SDL was blocking the bankruptcies of loss- 
making state companies, Moravcik replied that the government had 
not yet decided what part bankruptcies should play in dealing 
with the problems of the Slovak economy. The government had to 
take the whole situation into account, he said, adding that an 
acceptable level of employment had to be maintained. 
  Unemployment in Slovakia stands at 15 percent. In some 
areas, 
one in four of the working-age population is without work. 
  On another controversial point -- the approval of conditions 
set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the provision 
of loans -- Moravcik said that the government was still 
considering specific inroads into the expenditures and revenue 
of the state budget. 
  Last week Moravcik said that negotiations with the IMF had 
shown the necessity of increasing several taxes, and of limiting 
agricultural subsidies, in order for the budget deficit to 
remain below four percent of the gross national product. 
  However, Agriculture Minister Pavol Koncos today rejected 
any 
sort of reduction in subsidies to farming, stressing that only 
parliament could decide on changes in individual parts of the 
budget. "On this point I differ with the premier," Koncos told 
CTK.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 27 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
coalition parties intend to submit amendments to the election 
law and the law on the conflict of interests to the May 
parliamentary session, Deputy Premier Roman Kovac told 
journalists after a meeting of the Coalition Council of the 
governing parties today. The Coalition Council is to discuss 
these questions in detail at the beginning of next week, he said. 
  The coalition should take stand on two proposed changes in 
the election law. One concerns the proposal to increase the 
number of candidates on each party's slate from forty to fifty 
to ensure a sufficient number of substitutes are available when 
deputies get appointed to the cabinet suspended [as received] 
and when the as yet non-existent law on the conflict of 
interests is implemented. 
  It is well known that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS) of ex-premier Vladimir Meciar has found itself in such a 
situation in parliament that if the law on the conflict of 
interests is passed the HZDS would have fewer substitutes from 
Central Slovakia than necessary. 
  "A proposal was also raised for a change in the number of 
constituencies. While the HZDS has one slate for the whole of 
Slovakia, other political parties, on the contrary, want to have 
more constituencies," Kovac said. 
  According to observers, the increase or decrease in the 
number of constituencies could, to a certain extent, influence 
the outcome of early parliamentary elections to be held in 
Slovakia at the turn between September and October. The idea of 
Slovakia to be perceived as one constituency would enable the 
HZDS to submit one slate headed by Meciar as the most popular 
Slovak politician. A well-known name at the head of the slate 
would certainly influence many voters. On the contrary, in case 
of the increase of the number of constituencies (from the 
current four) the absence of well-known politicians such as 
Milan Knazko, Jozef Moravcik, and others from the HZDS might 
result in the HZDS' failure. 
  According to the latest public opinion polls, the HZDS leads 
in the election preferences with 32 percent of supporters. The 
April poll showed that the HZDS in the coalition with the Slovak 
National Party (SNS) would receive up to 36 percent of the vote, 
if elections were held today. The left-oriented parties would 
get 18 percent, parties on the right from the center 22 percent, 
and Hungarian minority parties 7 percent of the vote. The 
current government coalition would thus retain its majority in 
Parliament. Nevertheless, according to the polls, one in two 
Slovaks are convinced that Meciar's HZDS would win the elections.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava April 25 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
The problems concerning recognition of the inviolability of the 
current (Slovak-Hungarian) borders and the position of ethnic 
minorities are "artificially inflated, while in both cases it is 
possible to achieve agreements and guarantees which would bring 
about a satisfactory solution," Gabor Kuncze, a candidate for 
premiership of the Hungarian opposition Union of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ), tells the left-leaning PRAVDA. 
  It is not at all realistic to consider a possible change in 
the borders. Therefore, there is no sense in hampering the 
development of relations, Kuncze says, adding that Slovakia 
should make a step forward regarding the ethnic minorities. 
  "We do not believe that it is correct to refer to 
safeguarding the individual rights in this respect. In the 
sphere of minorities the individual rights can be ensured only 
by means of collective rights. For example, the use of the 
minority language cannot be applied individually if it has not 
been resolved on the collective basis of education in that 
language, its use in culture and administration. I believe that 
it is possible to discuss culture and language autonomy and a 
measure of autonomy in self- administration," Kuncze states. 
  Kuncze rejects "frightening the voters" by arguing that it 
will not be possible to form a government coalition and that the 
elections will be repeated in September. "I consider the voters 
wise enough to send the parties to the parliament so that it 
could be possible to form a competent government coalition. I 
do not think the elections will be repeated," he says. 
  Asked whether he can imagine becoming premier supported by 
the Hungarian Socialist Party, Kuncze replies that he does not 
deal with "occultism and prophecies."

  [Text] Bratislava, April 28 (CTK) -- If Hungary's 
relations with Slovakia are to improve, Hungary has to allay 
Slovak concern by guaranteeing inviolability of the border with 
Slovakia, Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik told journalists today. 
"We insist on the border's permanency since in Slovakia the 
fear that the border might be altered is a real political 
factor," Moravcik said, adding he believed an agreement on the 
issue might be concluded this year. 
  Moravcik said the meeting of the two countries' premiers 
planned for last Monday [25 April] did not take place due to 
Hungary's unwillingness to issue a joint statement on border 
inviolability. He also said that owing to his crowded schedule 
he would not attend the coming international meeting of Liberals 
at Visegrad in Hungary, where he was supposed to unofficially 
meet Hungarian Premier Peter Boross. But he added that he did 
not rule out the possibility of still meeting Boross before the 
elections. 
  Observers in Bratislava are skeptical about the meeting 
materializing in view of the Hungarian election campaign. 
Moravcik also warned that Slovak-Hungarian relations would not 
be helped by taking mutual problems to the "Balladur plan" 
meeting due to take place on May 26-27 in Paris. 
  French President [as received] Edouard Balladur has proposed 
that a conference should be held at which the twelve countries 
of the European Union, Central and East European countries, the 
United States and Canada should come together to try to resolve 
territorial and ethnic minority questions concerning the former 
Communist countries. The plan has been approved by the EU.

  [Text] Zilina, Central Slovakia, April 28 (CTK) -- The 
Slovak Government should be left in peace so that it can 
responsibly prepare the elections and continue the process of 
economic transformation, which is fatally unavoidable, Slovak 
President Michal Kovac said today. 
  Speaking at a meeting with representatives of local and 
state 
administration of the Zilina district, Kovac stressed that 
without privatization Slovakia would not cope with its present 
serious temporary economic and social troubles. The influx of 
foreign capital, indispensable for Slovakia, depends on the 
irreversibility of economic changes and the stability of the 
domestic political situation, Kovac said. 
  "Although Slovakia has a new government sworn-in in a 
legitimate way, the tension in our society has not yet dwindled 
completely," he stated, adding that weakening of the fragile 
democratic system could "result in the return to the 
authoritative regime". 
  Kovac called for national and political reconciliation and 
the unity of citizens. According to him, some people use the 
"Slovak principle" as a pretext for the search of "lines of 
separation, accusations, and finding of enemies." 
  In a discussion Kovac reacted to a statement by Zilina Mayor 
Jan Slota, made at the meeting, who cast doubt on the need to 
pay heed to what Western countries say on developments in 
Slovakia. 
  Kovac said that Slovakia's integration into European 
economic, political, and security structures was in its national 
and state interest, which must not be challenged by anybody. As 
a new country, Slovakia is perhaps monitored in a far more 
sensitive manner than Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. 
In this connection, reactions in Slovakia are also sensitive 
when some Western politicians omit Slovakia when listing the 
countries of Europe's interest, Kovac said, adding that he 
himself was very sensitive to it. "When we find out...that it is 
caused by our domestic policy, we are obliged to draw changes 
from it," he said. 
  Referring to the question of the Magyarization of ethnic 
Slovaks living in southern Slovakia, Kovac said he was disturbed 
by this, but the solution of the problem was in the hands of the 
Slovak cabinet, which could, for example, earmark certain funds 
from the state budget. 
  During his two-day working stay in central Slovak districts 
of Zilina and Cadca, Michal Kovac is also to visit enterprises 
and cultural and historical monuments, and meet with business 
people.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 28 (CTK) -- The introduction of 
the certification requirement will not affect consumers, Slovak 
Agriculture Minister Pavol Koncos said today. Such was his 
response to Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus's statement that the 
requirement could cause consumer prices to rise in Slovakia by 
raising the cost of food products. 
  "On the contrary, it was the Czechs who adopted regulations 
that raise the prices of imported food products," Koncos said. 
He reminded journalists that the Czech Republic calculates 
value-added tax on imported food products based on prices 
adjusted to include duty payments, although duty is not charged 
on Slovak products because of the existence of the Customs 
Union. Slovakia is therefore forced to respond in a similar 
fashion, he said. 
  Within a month and a half at most, Czech imports to Slovakia 
will no longer be limited, Koncos added. The only goal of the 
requirement is to protect consumers from low quality products, 
he stated, adding however that the Slovak deficit in trade with 
agricultural and food products with the Czech Republic totalled 
nearly four billion crowns last year.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava April 25 (CTK) -- The creation of the 
Slovak Democratic Union (DEUS) from the Alliance of Democrats 
(AD SR) and the Alternative of Political Realism (APR) is 
another step confirming that the political parties tend to 
integrate, the independent daily SMENA comments on yesterday's 
merger of the two groupings. 
  "While the left-wing, conservative and extremist parties are 
still crystallising, it is necessary to admit that the Slovak 
political spectrum is lacking a really democratic and liberal 
party which could appeal to voters to whom Meciar (chairman of 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS), Weiss (chairman 
of the Democratic Left Party, SDL) or Carnogursky (chairman of 
the Christian Democratic Movement, KDH) are unacceptable for 
various reasons," the paper notes. 
  If the DEUS becomes this sort of a party, the future will 
not 
investigate whether the "first defectors from the HZDS," who 
rejected Meciar's political methods half a year after his 
smashing electoral victory, united with the politicians who 
sided with Meciar longer and "even some of the newly fledged 
liberals who personally caused that Meciar's fall did not come a 
bit earlier," the paper states. 
  Jozef Moravcik's election as the DEUS chairman may be 
conceived as violating the coalition agreements, according to 
which top political figures should not be represented in the 
government. On the other hand, it could be said that not to 
place a politician whose poll ratings have been the same as 
Meciar's to the top of the party would be amateurish, the paper 
says. 
  "One of the essential questions of mankind is: Who are we, 
where are we coming from and where are we heading for. In case 
of DEUS representatives, it seems to be obvious who they are and 
where they are coming from. And it will be decided whether or 
not the slightly bitter taste in the mouth will remain, only 
after they show where they are heading for," the daily concludes. 
  "As in any Slovak political party, there is a dormant 
tension 
in the DEUS, too," the independent NARODNA OBRODA says. "It is 
more than probable that it will not transpire before elections 
(scheduled for September 30-October 1), but then the struggle 
for the essence of Slovak liberalism will take place," the daily 
adds. 
  The paper asks the question whether the DEUS will be 
dominated by a group of entrepreneurs "eying the right" who have 
no experience with the HZDS and for whom the liberal party 
constitutes a means of political activity rather than evasion, 
or by the socially-orientated DEUS members who have quite 
recently voted in the parliament as is right for an HZDS deputy. 
  "While Milan Knazko, Jan Budaj and Rudolf Filkus were 
building the party at the time when this activity was really not 
a source of popularity, at present the HZDS ranks have been 
swamped with liberals. There is a real threat that liberalism 
will become an escape channel for the deputies who do not care 
much for their orientation, but rather for the advantages 
connected with the post of deputy. The boundaries of Slovak 
liberalism will be defined only after the elections," the paper 
notes. 
  The DEUS "as an HZDS with human face" has a chance to win 
over a part of the HZDS electorate as well as new voters, the 
daily states. 
  "And this is not little, in particular if we bear in mind 
that Slovakia had to decide in 1990 what percentage the 
communists would get, and in 1992 whether or not the Federation 
would be preserved. In 1994 the main issue will be whether or 
not Meciar will be allowed to make good another promise to 
return. Indeed, although some politicians are reluctant to say 
it aloud, this will be the crucial issue of the elections," the 
paper concludes. 
  The tabloid NOVY CAS reports that the polls give the new 
party nine per cent. If the KDH enters the elections 
separately, the DEUS would be the strongest partner in the 
right-wing and centre coalition. Such a bloc stands a chance of 
becoming the third strongest party after the HZDS and the left 
bloc. "This achievement would please all the voters who have 
criticised the clumsy cooperation of the right and were burying 
its ambitions even in these elections," the paper states.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 27 (CTK) -- Forty-five percent of 
Slovaks believe that early elections (scheduled for September 
30-October 1) will be won by Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), who was dismissed [from the post of 
prime minister] in parliament in March, a poll conducted by the 
Slovak Statistical Office in April revealed. 
  Fifteen percent of Slovaks believe the victory will be 
scored 
by Peter Weiss's Democratic Left Party (SDL). The victory of 
Premier Jozef Moravcik's Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) was 
predicted by five percent of those polled. 
  Twenty-two percent of Slovaks would never vote for the HZDS. 
The same number would not vote for the Christian Democratic 
Movement (KDH). The poll revealed that the two parties' 
followers are the strongest opponents of one another.

  [Text] Tirana, April 26 (ATA) -- The tribunal of Skopje 
had scheduled for April 25 the trial against 10 Albanians 
arrested several months ago, among who Mitat Emini, former 
secretary of the Democratic Prosperity Party, Shenasi Rexhepi, 
former assistant minister of defence in The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and others. The trial has been 
postponed for May 9, 1994 due to the strike staged by defence 
attorneys. 
  The 10 Albanians are accused of the criminal act of 
"collaboration for hostile activity," the Albanian TV said in an 
information with a source from Skopje. Further on the 
information said that Macedonian means of information are 
manipulating even in the case of this trial, presenting the 
accused as heads of the Albanian Army in this republic. Their 
trial is being used for political aims on the verge of 
multinational elections, presenting the Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia endangered by them. The Albanian political parties 
in this republic considered the said trial as framed and against 
the Albanians.

  [Text] Tirana, April 26 (ATA) -- In early hours of April 
25, Serbian forces that control the border between Kosova and 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
killed the Albanian Naim Bajrami from Llashtice of Gjilan. 
Still no reports have arrived about the conditions in which 
Bajrami, father of two children, was killed. He was killed near 
the Miratovc village, the commune of Presheve. 
  The sub Council for the Defence of the Human Rights and 
Freedoms in Gjilan reports that Naim was searched by Serbian 
police while during the last week police searched his home in 
Llashtice, under the pretext of looking for arms. He was killed 
while he was leaving Kosova because of the pressures and threats 
by the Serbian police. 
  Bajrami is the second Albanian victim of the Serbian terror 
killed on the Kosova-Macedonia border since the beginning of 
this year.

  [Text] Tirana, April 27 (ATA) -- Three tank trucks 
destined for Montenegro have been intercepted and the vehicles 
together with 67 thousand litres of fuel confiscated. This is 
the latest bag of the Shkoder financial police, who arrested the 
three drivers in a blitz operation as they were attempting to 
move their contraband cargo across the Buna river. According to 
the financial police, the vehicles had Tirana, Lac and Fier 
plates. The tank trucks and the fuel are now in the possession 
of the Shkoder financial police. The drivers will face 
prosecution. 
  At the beginning of the year, the financial police broke up 
another smuggling operation destined for Montenegro involving 
three tractors each with 1,000 litres of fuel and 15 barrels of 
oil. The police also shut down a trading station near Velipoje, 
which was furnishing kerosene to smugglers.

  [Text] Tirana, April 27 (ATA) -- The Greek paper STOKHOS 
of April 13 carries at the head of the page a photo of a group 
of armed militarymen which the newspaper refers to as "a unit of 
our liberation army." The motto of this paper which you can 
notice in each of its issues is the expression: "The only way 
to establish peace in the Balkans is the Hellenization of the 
entire Balkans." On March 2, 1994 the same paper warned for 
"the creation of the units which would fight for the `defence' 
of the North Epirus and the Hellenization in general." 
  In the reprinted photo, the eyes of the terrorists have been 
covered in order that they be not identified. Hence, this 
newspaper which makes a pure warmongering propaganda has full 
knowledge of the activity of the terroristic groups and protects 
them. What about the Greek Government, does it know anything 
about these facts? According to STOKHOS, there are at least 8 
units of the "liberation army." What is the Greek Government's 
attitude towards them and towards such papers as STOKHOS, which 
stir up war in the Balkans and declare openly their chauvinistic 
aims? 
  It not only does not take any measure against them but on 
the 
contrary, in relation with the latest crime in Albania, Greek 
authorities declare that the Albanian party did not present 
facts at a time when the terrorists have posed for Greek papers. 
  Greece is a member of the EC and it knows well the 
international laws especially that which does not allow the 
changing of the borders through violence. Above the photo of 
the terrorists, the STOKHOS had written: "Fear in Tirana From 
the Strong Attack." The Greek andarts [as received] have once 
learned well how much the Albanians have feared them but it is 
clear that those who write in this paper are men who have never 
known any bravery. To come and go at night, to kill people at 
their back, this is their bravery. Anyhow it is good for the 
Greek Government to act before criminals and terroristic groups 
that come from its territory undertake other adventures, thus 
not creating themselves the possibility of experiencing how 
greatly the Albanians "fear" them.

  [Text] Tirana April 29 (ATA) -- In the April 28 plenary 
session of the parliament, the Albanian premier, Aleksander 
Meksi, replied to the questions of Arben Imami, independent 
deputy, and the groups of DP [Democratic Party] and SP 
[Socialist Party] deputies on the price changes in fuel and 
electric power. 
  Meksi pointed out that the decision is taken in relation to 
the developments of fire-wood production private sector, the 
necessity for the development of private sector in the 
production and selling of electric power and avoiding the abuses 
in its usage and subsidies as well. 
  The government aims to secure the supply of population with 
these provisions pointed out Meksi saying that in the future, 
electric power will meet better the vital demands, as 
lightening, cooking but in no way for heating. To achieve this 
we have applied the principle of compensation to salaries, in 
order to cover the price rise. Admitting that we compensate a 
quota of 160 kilowatt hours in a month per family for the whole 
year, we compensate the consumed electric power against payment 
for 1993 and more than 50 per cent of free of charge consumed 
quantity, so more than the needs and possibilities. 
  The government will improve the legislation, considering the 
usage of electric power without payment as a criminal case and 
will invest in the improvement of electric apparatus as well as 
the eventual privatisation of the sector for the delivering of 
electric power. 
  In the end he said that taking into consideration these 
reasons, the government decided that the compensation for a 
family should be 700 lek in a month. This will enter in force 
in 1995 and will be a permanent part of a monthly salary for the 
whole year. Later was approved the law "An Addition to the 
Law", "On the City Planning" presented for approval by the 
president Sali Berisha. 
  The law will impede the illegal selling of the construction 
sites, sold since January the first 1990. The persons that have 
carried out the purchase and the registration in cadastre and 
mortgage will be reimbursed the cost of the site according to 
the present index of the prices.

  [Text] Tirana, April 29 (ATA) -- Albania will sell abroad a 
part of pesticides through open auctions. The pesticides were 
brought in Albania as credits in favourable conditions during 
the last three years. The Albanian Government has commissioned 
the Ministry of Agriculture for selling the pesticides initially 
to the producing companies and later on through open auctions. 
  "A special commission of the Ministry of Agriculture will 
follow all the international laws in pesticides sale", Hasan 
Halili, minister of agriculture told an ATA reporter. Mr. 
Halili said he considers pesticides selling to be the only 
acceptable solution for avoiding the grave ecological and 
environmental repercussions the pesticides might bring about 
when they expire. 
  Last October, the government permitted the sale of the 
pesticides inside Albania but according to the data of the 
Ministry of Agriculture and food the sold quantity has been 
insignificant. 
  Mr. Halili said the very companies which brought the 
pesticides in Albania has continually made requests for retaking 
them. "If the producing companies would not evade in a proper 
time the pesticides, we will put them to auction after we have 
got the approval of the organisms which financed their 
transport", he said. 
  The European Union, through the Picu office in Tirana, has 
been the first organism which offered its assistance for 
treating the pesticides brought in Albania in the context of the 
PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] 
program. The specialists say they are worried about the 
pesticides problem. 
  480 tons of pesticides were brought in Albania during the 
1991-1993 period through the Italian credit, PHARE program and 
the World Bank credit.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Albanian Foreign Ministry in Tirana </F>
on 30 April: "Calculated Provocation by the Greek Embassy in 
Tirana" -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Yesterday, on 29 April 1994, Mr. Toulupas, charge 
d'affaires at the Greek Embassy in Tirana, twice presented 
himself at the Foreign Ministry of Albania and, in the name of 
Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, protested in a 
provocative, slanderous, and improper way some hindrances 
allegedly imposed by the Public Order Ministry impeding the 
Albanian Orthodox community's normal celebration of the Easter 
holiday. 
  The Foreign Ministry considers this to be an act of 
premeditated and calculated provocation and a continuation of 
previous statements by Greek authorities on their alleged 
concern over whether the Orthodox Easter holiday is to be 
normally celebrated in Albania. This provocation testifies to 
the fact that there exists a clear connection between these 
statements by the Greek authorities regarding the Easter holiday 
and the action of the Greek diplomat in Tirana. It aims at 
aggravating the atmosphere before the meeting of both countries' 
foreign ministers in Zurich on 3 May 1994. 
  The Foreign Ministry clarifies that all festivities related 
to the Albanian Orthodox Easter holiday have been and will be 
held normally, because Albanian law ensures and guarantees 
freedom of religion to all its nationals who are believers. 
  There have been no complaints from any secular or church 
representative of the Orthodox community to Albanian state 
authorities regarding any obstacles or difficulties impeding the 
performance of religious festivities. 
  We reiterate that the Albanian Orthodox Church is and will 
remain autocephalous and any arbitration by the Greek Embassy in 
the name of Orthodox believers aims at infringing its 
autocephaly and is considered to be interference in the internal 
affairs of the Albanian state. 
  The Greek Government spokesman's statement on 29 April 1994, 
after religious ceremonies were normally held, maliciously 
distorts the truth and facts and constitutes a dishonorable 
tendency to exploit religion, the freedom of which is guaranteed 
in Albania, and casts doubts over the Greek Government's desire 
to go through with the meeting of foreign ministers scheduled 
for 3 May 1994 in Zurich, a meeting that the Albanian Government 
was seriously engaged in. The government believes that the 
nonrealization of this meeting will not serve the mutual 
interests of both countries and even less the region's, and that 
responsibility for this will fall on the Greek Government.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Albanian Public Order Ministry in </F>
Tirana on 30 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] The Public Order Ministry informs that all 
religious ceremonies have been and are being held normally on 
the territory of the Republic of Albania. No protest or written 
or oral complaint regarding such ceremonies has been received by 
this ministry. 
  Concerning the celebration of the Orthodox Easter in Tirana, 
the ministry explains that at 1230 on 27 April 1994, Police 
Commissariat No. 2 in Tirana District received a written request 
from the Autocephalous Church of Albania which presented two 
requests. One was for permission for a procession of clerics to 
go from the church to Kavaje Street and back again. This 
permission was requested for 29 April 1994 at 1900. The second 
request had to do with the organization of a ceremony in the 
form of a gathering, to celebrate the resurrection ritual. For 
this ceremony, the construction of a tribune on the pavement in 
front of Mihal Duri Factory was requested. They asked for 
permission to hold this ceremony on 30 April 1994 from 2300 
until 0015. 
  By means of an official document No. 1195/1 dated 27 April 
1994, Police Commissariat No. 2 responded that the organization 
of both ceremonies creates serious traffic problems on the 
national road, something that can be of consequence for the 
lives of the people. That is why it did not conduct security for 
these two activities. 
  At the same time, the commissariat suggested that it was 
ready to go anywhere but the national road and provide security 
for the event. 
  Through a second document dated 28 April 1994, the 
Autocephalous Orthodox Church authorities relinquished their 
first demand and asked only for approval of the second request, 
without presenting any protest or complaint against the police. 
  On 29 April 1994, the church authorities received a final 
positive answer from Police Commissariat No. 2 to hold this 
event. Besides this, regarding contacts between police 
representatives and high church authorities, including the 
archbishop, they have received only thanks from them and no 
complaints. 
  The Public Order Ministry stresses that the religious masses 
are free and no one hinders them in the Republic of Albania. 
However, when a religious authority requests help from public 
order authorities, they of course will give it according to 
their ability to secure the event. We express our surprise and 
deep indignation at the tendency of the Greek Government to 
exploit even Easter Day for its political aims.

<F P=106> [Commentary by G. Miri: "The Matter Could Be Brought to </F>
Court"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the Albanian-language media in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] broadcast 
an extremely harsh protest against Albanian Radio-Television 
[RTSH] by the ethnic Albanian parliamentary group, Albanian 
ministers in the Macedonian Government, and other members of 
Macedonian state institutions. They described the work of 
Albanian Radio-Television as "anti-Albanian activity aimed at 
splitting further the Albanian political body in Macedonia." At 
the same time, they repeated that RTSH programs have contained 
inaccurate news, implying that this was done for divisive 
purposes. If the RTSH and its programs are going to continue 
like this with their lies and slanders, the Albanian political, 
state, and public figures in Macedonia pledged that they "would 
be compelled to bring it to court." 
  How could the RTSH come to such a fateful point? 
  All this comes as no surprise. It was in fact the RTSH's 
real objective from the very beginning to reach a point that 
could virtually be called extremely detrimental to the national 
cause by splitting and misinforming the nation. There is no 
cause for wonder, because the RTSH first started doing this sort 
of thing with the Albanians in Albania by unjustly accusing, 
differentiating, and insulting them, by misinforming the public, 
and not allowing others to speak their mind. However, the 
people in charge of the RTSH are under the "umbrella" of the 
party in power, and are therefore untouchable. They have been 
running unstopped. If nobody deters them in Macedonia, the 
danger will be much greater. 
  Do the RTSH's divisive activities, as our compatriots in 
Macedonia call them, have any significance for our national 
unity? It may sound paradoxical, but it is of immense 
significance. The political parties, intellectuals, and 
ordinary people here in Albania who were directly or indirectly 
affected by the RTSH over this period used to think that it was 
their misfortune alone, and that nobody cared about their 
plight. Meanwhile, the RTSH extended its evil activities to the 
detriment of Albanians living outside Albania. When the poor 
Albanians heard about it, they felt somewhat relieved that they 
could share their plight with their brothers across the border. 
This is a very good opportunity for Albanians to unite in their 
plight, which was created for them by the so-called RTSH. 
  What can we say about the financial problems of the RTSH? 
Since the RTSH satellite programs are sponsored by Albanians 
living outside Albania, as is public knowledge, and since the 
whole thing was built up by those Albanians, it means that the 
RTSH has obligations toward them. However, it does not mean the 
obligation to misinform the public, lie, and pursue divisive 
activities, as the declaration from Macedonia proves the RTSH is 
actually doing. Recently the RTSH has been launching appeals for 
cash donations to its bank account. After all these 
professional flaws and the discontent that the RTSH has created, 
one might doubt that any money will be forthcoming. 
  Finally, what is the Albanian parliament going to do about 
it? According to the law, the RTSH answers to the Albanian 
parliament, and one of its defined objectives is to serve the 
national cause. Thus, parliament finds itself confronted by two 
great problems. Will this parliament have its say on the matter, 
given that both the law and our national unity have been 
damaged? It remains to be seen.

<F P=106> [Interview with resigned Deputy Defense Minister Boyko Noev </F>
by Petya Vladimorova in Sofia on 25 April: "I Have Confidence 
in the Defense Minister's Efforts"] 
  [Text] [Vladimirova] Mr. Noev, when the army budget was 
being planned, Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov hinted that 
he may submit his resignation if the budget is cut beyond what 
is acceptable. General Petrov, chief of the General Staff, said 
the same thing, but in much stronger terms, and the General 
Staff even sent a letter to all units that frankly described the 
disastrous situation of the Army. Today, however, it is you who 
resigned. 
  [Noev] I have not followed closely who has made what 
statements. When the budget estimates were being made and we 
asked for one-third of the available funds to be allocated to 
military needs, it was clear to everyone that we would not get 
one-third, because 37 billion leva is beyond the state's 
capabilities. As for whether I heard about the letter with 
information on the state of the army that was sent to the 
troops, the answer is yes. As far as I know, it expresses what 
the top army officer told parliament. My personal view is that 
the sending of this document to the troops has seriously damaged 
officers' self-esteem. The document in question contains 
assessments that, if they proved to be true, would mean that we 
simply would have no army. However, the situation is not so 
clear. We must see whether such a document was really sent out 
and how it affected the morale of the officers. 
  [Vladimirova] The press organs of the political force that 
wants your resignation -- it is no secret that this is the BSP 
[Bulgarian Socialist Party] -- are raising a furor over 
discontent being rife in the Army. At the same time, a letter 
of the kind that the General Staff reportedly sent out to the 
troops cannot in itself be a source of tension. Unprejudiced 
people are inclined to link this document with the newspaper 
campaign that ended with demands for resignations. What is your 
view on this? 
  [Noev] Please allow me to decline to comment on your 
analysis. I would only like to say that it is indeed true that 
serious feelings of disappointment and loss of faith have 
arisen. I cannot say whether this letter represents the result, 
or whether it led to this discontent. 
  [Vladimirova] What do you expect to happen after your 
resignation? 
  [Noev] I hope that it will contribute to finding the best 
personnel decisions as far as the cabinet is concerned. I have 
confidence in the efforts of Professor Berov and Minister 
Aleksandrov. 
  [Vladimirova] It is no secret that the minister held you in 
high regard, yet now you are leaving to enable Minister 
Aleksandrov and Prof. Berov to find the best possible personnel 
decisions. Is this not a logical contradiction? 
  [Noev] No. because Minister Aleksandrov would not have 
accepted my resignation, that is why I submitted it direct to 
Prime Minister Berov. 
  [Vladimirova] How do you assess the army reform so far? 
  [Noev] The reform is going slowly, but Minister Aleksandrov 
is doing everything possible to press forward with the changes, 
and I am sure that his efforts are in the interest of all the 
democratic forces in Bulgaria. 
  [Vladimirova] Thank you for the interview, Mr. Noev.

<F P=106> [Report by Svetla Koleva: "Boyko Noev's Reignation Was His </F>
Personal Decision"] 
  [Text] The Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] did not make 
any official or unofficial demand for the resignation of Deputy 
Defense Minister Boyko Noev, Nikolay Kamov [deputy leader of the 
BSP-led parliamentary group] told correspondents, adding that 
such an act was merely a matter solely for a personal decision. 
  According to Kamov, it is no accident that the BSP is 
demanding that the government review the action or lack of 
action of all top state officials in delaying to provide 
information on the UN request for an air corridor. The 
socialist deputies claim that Noev attempted to present in the 
National Assembly his political assessment of the situation, 
which is in sharp contradiction to the Constitution. The BSP 
leadership regards Noev's resignation as a lesson for all state 
servants who intend to undertake actions not in conformance with 
their powers or the law.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gregor Martin Papucsek from </F>
Budapest] 
  [Excerpts] Last night's dialogue between the Slovak and 
Hungarian prime ministers was not in vain. At least they 
established which of the problems were of greater importance. 
One of these problems is the so-called basic treaty, which 
contains a clause on the unalterability of the border. This is 
what Peter Boross said when responding to my question about 
whether the Hungarian side allowed itself be convinced by Jozef 
Moravcik's arguments: 
  [Begin Boross recording, in Hungarian with superimposed 
translation into Slovak] Given the complexity of this issue and 
the type of talks we have had, we were unable to reach a final 
agreement. This, of course, does not counter our intention to 
examine all the issues, systematically and as a part of a 
consistent dialogue. But that requires a lot of time. We must 
adopt a realistic attitude when solving difficult issues. [end 
recording] 
  Since we want to adopt a realistic attitude, the first thing 
we could agree on is the opening of new border crossings. True, 
the prime ministers failed both to define specific crossings and 
to set specific dates. But the Slovak side does not link this 
issue with the readmission agreement, as was the case until the 
recent past. Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said: 
  [Begin Moravcik recording] We discussed the readmission 
agreement (?before). We do not link the conclusion of this 
agreement with border crossings. We indicated the ways in which 
existing differences in views on both sides can be overcome. 
There is a need for more talks with other states, so that the 
stream of people coming from other countries, particularly from 
Germany, would not be halted in either country. [end recording]

  [Text] The Hungarian Socialist Party [HSP] calls on the 
leader of Hungarian Television to ensure the cleanness of 
political programs in the remaining part of the election 
campaign and to suspend from their jobs the editors of the 
"Newsreel" and "Panorama" programs. Imre Szekeres, executive 
deputy chairman of the HSP, notes in a letter addressed to TV 
Deputy Chairman Gabor Nahlik that the television documentary and 
news programs contain false allegations that fulfill the 
conditions for defamation and public slander. The HSP demands 
that the editors responsible for the programs apologize publicly 
to the party and the slandered politicians, and that Deputy 
Chairman Gabor Nahlik apologize for the false accusations by 2 
May. The HSP is asking the National Election Committee to take 
a stance in connection with Hungarian Television's political 
programs; if no change occurs the party will appeal to the 
supreme state prosecutor.

  [Text] Skopje, April 30 (AA) -- Macedonian Prime Minister 
Branko Crvenkovski on Saturday said that the Balkans are under a 
war threat, warning that Greece and Serbia are aiming at 
creating a joint border after disintegrating Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  "Neither country is willing to accept the reality of an 
independent Macedonia in the Balkans. Both have common 
interests in Macedonia," he said. 
  Speaking to AA reporters in Skopje, he accused the European 
Union and United Nations of following "a passive policy in the 
region", adding this indecisive attitude by international 
organizations has brought the region on the brink of a new war. 
  Crvenkovski said there is a great political harmony between 
Belgrade and Athens, stressing the greatest support for Serbia 
comes from Athens and that the embargo imposed on his country by 
Greece was started with cooperation with Serbia. 
  He said Turkey is Macedonia's "best friend" in the Balkans, 
expressing gratitude for its support. "Turkey's policy is one 
that Macedonia is looking for and expects," he concluded.

  [Text] Skopje -- The representatives of the Democratic 
Party of Macedonian Serbs have claimed in Skopje today that 
2,000 Turkish "Blue Helmets" are being brought to Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. They did not 
want to disclose where they obtained this information, saying 
only that it came "from well-informed sources." In their 
opinion the arrival of the Turks in Macedonia will be decisively 
opposed by both the Serbian and the Macedonian population. They 
assessed this deployment as an attempt to destabilize this area, 
adding that the only guarantee of peace and stability in this 
part of the Balkans was the arrival of Russian "Blue Helmets" as 
part of the UN Protection Forces.

Michael Rose] The incident lasted about an hour, and during the 
incident the Leopard tanks replied with a significant number of 
shots. 
  [Floquet] How many shots did they fire? 
  [Chaperon] The exact figure is 72. 
  [Floquet] That's a huge response. 
  [Chaperon] The response was considerable, you are right, but 
then so was the attack. The Danes did what they had to do. 
[end recording] 
  [Floquet] It was the local Danish commander who decided to 
respond without asking Sarajevo, Zagreb, or the United Nations 
if he was doing the right thing. This evening UNPROFOR is 
backing him. It even seems to be delighted. And the Serbs are 
not reacting. So many UN troops are wondering now whether they 
should not have demonstrated their strength and determination a 
little sooner. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Bernard Besserglik] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, May 2 (AFP) -- NATO warplanes were called 
in to deter a group of Serbs who attempted to remove a heavy 
weapon from a collection point within the 20-kilometre (12.5 
mile) exclusion zone around Sarajevo, a UN spokesman said 
Monday. Around the same time three Serb shells fell in a 
non-residential area of central Sarajevo, another spokesman said. 
  The Serbs approached the collection point at Poljine, near 
Vogosca, six kilometres (four miles) north of Sarajevo, at 8:00 
p.m. (1800 GMT) Sunday, and demanded that they be allowed to 
move a 122mm gun stored in the depot with several other 
large-calibre guns, UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] spokesman 
Eric Chaperon said. French UN peacekeepers at the site rejected 
the demand, and the Serbs left around midnight after NATO planes 
were called in to overfly the region. 
  Meanwhile three Serb shells exploded near the Grbavica area 
of Sarajevo, Sarajevo sector spokesman Guy Vinet said. Two fell 
300 metres (yards) from the Brotherhood and Unity bridge, the 
main crossing point between central Sarajevo and the 
Serb-controlled Grbavica suburb. No casualties were reported. 
  The incidents were the latest in a series in which Serb 
forces have violated or attempted to violate ceasefire 
agreements and exclusion zones ordered by the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organisation around Sarajevo and Gorazde in eastern 
Bosnia. 
  An UNPROFOR convoy bringing a British battalion of 
peacekeepers to Gorazde was still held up early Monday at 
Rogatica where local officials were demanding to inspect the 
personal possessions of the troops, Chaperon said. 
  The convoy set out for Gorazde at 8:00 a.m. on Saturday and 
was held up at the first Serb checkpoint between Sarajevo and 
Kiseljak, west of the capital, for most of the day. An UNPROFOR 
spokesman said Sunday he believed the convoy had been allowed 
through Rogatica, located midway along the 70-killometre 
(40-mile) route between Sarajevo and Gorazde. 
  The troops are badly needed to reinforce the 500 
peacekeepers 
currently policing the exclusion zone imposed on the 
UN-designated safe area. Chaperon said the delay was a 
violation of NATO's April 22 ultimatum ordering free and 
unimpeded movement for UNPROFOR and humanitarian relief convoys. 
  An attack on Danish Leopard tanks near the safe area of 
Tuzla, in northeastern Bosnia, late Friday left nine dead and 
four wounded on the Serb side when the UN peacekeepers riposted, 
Chaperon said, citing figures issued by the Serbs. The tanks 
fired 72 rounds during the exchange near a UN observation post. 
"Shooting at a Leopard is a very bad idea," Chaperon added. 
  The sector further north near Brcko, where UNFPROFOR has 
detected a build-up of Serb heavy weapons and Bosnian army 
infantry in recent days, was reported quiet. 
  A group of around 100 Serb militiamen had grouped on the 
east 
bank of the Drina river within the three-kilometre (two-mile) 
exclusion zone in Gorazde, Chaperon said. Most of the men were 
currently unarmed, though they had been armed earlier, he added 
said. The Serbs claimed to be policemen, ensuring the 
protection of Serb civilians in that part of the town, he noted.

  [Text] The talks that Radovan Karadzic, president of the 
Srpska republic, and Aleksa Buha, foreign minister of the 
republic of Srpska, held with a seven-member international 
contact group, a working body for establishing peace in the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, ended in Pale today. 
  After the talks, which were held behind closed doors, Aleksa 
Buha, foreign minister of the republic of Srpska, and German 
representative Michael Steiner made brief statements. Steiner 
said that the group had presented its views and ideas and that 
several interesting views and positions had been presented 
during the talks. We sincerely hope that the ideas that we 
presented here will be accepted, and that will have an effect on 
the Serbian side, because our motive is to turn the situation 
toward peace, Steiner said. 
  Aleksa Buha, foreign minister of the republic of Srpska, 
said 
that the group that came to Pale today to hold talks with the 
representatives of the republic of Srpska should connect up the 
broken threads of the peace process again. The two sides 
exchanged views on that today. Our side, the Serbian side, 
wanted the contact group to note everything that has happened in 
the mean time, the bombing, the ultimatums, and the creation of 
the Croatian-Muslim federation. We wanted the peace process to 
continue with a different methodology and we informed the 
representatives of the contact group about that. 
  Buha also said that both sides share the view that a good 
start was made today and that they should continue in the same 
direction.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 29 (AFP) -- An international 
contact group looking to mediate between the warring Bosnians 
left here Friday [29 April] amid little sign of progress. The 
nine-man group, which Friday travelled the short journey to 
Pale, east of Sarajevo, for talks with Serb leaders later 
returned for a further meeting with Bosnia's Moslem President 
Alija Izetbegovic, before flying on to Zagreb. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement after the group's departure, Izetbegovic said 
his discussions with the group had provided no results. He said 
he had set no conditions for restarting negotiations apart from 
full Serb compliance with the NATO ultimatum and ceasefire, but 
said he was not satisfied with the situation in Gorazde. There 
were Serb troops deployed in part of the three-kilometre 
(two-mile) exclusion zone dressed as police, and artillery 
remaining in the outer exclusion zone of 20 kilometres (12.5 
miles). He added that since the Bosnian Government had received 
no guarantee from the international community, the army must 
continue to defend "free" territory. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Members of the contact group for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that includes representatives of the United 
States, Russia, France, Germany, Great Britain, and the United 
Nations had talks today with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Here is a report by Nedzad 
Leko: 
  [Begin recording] [Leko] After the talks, the first to 
address the journalists was David Manning, head of the contact 
group and representative of Great Britain: 
  [Manning, in English with superimposed translation into 
Serbo-Croatian] We have had two very useful days of talks, both 
here and in Pale. We have established two courses of action. 
We need a cease-fire and we must accelerate the diplomatic 
process. We have expounded our ideas to both sides. They 
listened to us and presented their first reactions. We should 
come back next week. We shall leave them time to think about 
this so that next week we shall be able to see how far we have 
got. 
  [Leko] [passage omitted] Speaking about the talks that he 
had with the members of the contact group, President Alija 
Izetbegovic said the following: 
  [Izetbegovic] Well, I do not have anything special to tell 
you, apart from the fact that [word indistinct] Mr. Redman and 
his associates said that the Serbs had agreed to comply with the 
conditions of the ultimatum that [word indistinct] on Gorazde. 
As far as we know, they still have not done so, but they are 
supposedly going to. Of course, we are going to monitor their 
activities and see what they will do. 
  The talks about the cessation of hostilities are continuing. 
No special agreement has been reached as yet. This group, the 
contact group will come again all together on 5 May to resume 
the talks. That is all. They have informed us about the course 
of the talks held in Pale. 
  [Leko] Foreign journalists asked President Izetbegovic 
whether he is satisfied with the way the aggressor is complying 
with the NATO ultimatum. 
  [Izetbegovic] I am not satisfied with what has been done in 
Gorazde. Namely, they have kept armed people there as police 
(?cadres) within the 3-km radius. And there is still some heavy 
weaponry within the 20-km radius. 
  [Leko] Under what conditions will you negotiate with the 
enemy, the foreign journalists asked. 
  [Izetbegovic] We have said that we will negotiate, provided 
that that the conditions of [words indistinct] (?in Gorazde). 
There are no other conditions. There is only the assertion that 
there are going to be no special [words indistinct]. Of course, 
we are going to demand guarantees of their compliance with the 
cease-fire. 
  [Leko] One journalist asked: Are you afraid that the 
aggressor may continue that same practice of redeploying heavy 
weapons to other fronts? 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, we pointed out this danger. We want the 
international community to take some measures against the future 
moving of heavy artillery and equipment that was concentrated 
around Gorazde. In this respect we do not have any special 
guarantees and it has therefore remained for our army to defend 
(?these) free territories. This is the only guarantee. [words 
indistinct] our [words indistinct] Sarajevo and Gorazde. 
However, we cannot (?deny) that the international community has 
nevertheless done something in that respect. Sarajevo [words 
indistinct] is obviously under [words indistinct]. In Gorazde 
[passage indistinct]. 
  However, our army obviously has to defend these territories 
and in this respect, I think that it is ready [to do so]. 
  [Leko] Will you accept a permanent cease-fire?, the foreign 
journalists asked. 
  [Izetbegovic] We are going to accept a temporary cease-fire 
only. We are going to accept a temporary cease-fire only, of 
between two and three months. They have [words indistinct]. We 
have refused [word indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Zvornik, Bratunac, 19 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim 
attacks and armed provocations against the republic of Srpska 
(RS) were evidently less intense and widespread today in 
comparison with the situation in recent days, a TANJUG reporter 
has found out from republic of Srpska army sources. The same 
sources interpret this as a consequence of direct activities by 
the international Contact Group, which held talks in Sarajevo 
yesterday with representatives of the Muslim leaderhip. Reasons 
for the reduced level of combat activity by the Muslim units lie 
in the international efforts to bring about a four-month 
cease-fire, something which had been demanded by the Muslim 
leadership in Sarajevo, Serbian military sources point out. This 
is explained by the need to provide a let-up for the Muslim 
formations, which also gives them enough time to prepare new 
wider attacks against the RS, some of which are already under 
way. 
  Serbian military sources say that republic of Srpska army 
units yesterday completely crushed an extremely strong two-day 
attack by the Muslim artillery and infantry units, mainly on the 
Mackov Vrh-Javorak-Neokrinje line in the Vlasic area. [passage

  [Text] Belgrade, April 29 (TANJUG) -- A report that leaked 
out recently from sources close to the CIA says that U.S. 
humanitarian airdrops to Bosnian Moslems contained not only arms 
for fighting the Serbs but also blood plasma contaminated with 
the deadly AIDS virus, the Belgrade daily EKSPRES POLITIKA 
writes on Friday [29 April]. The paper says that U.S. President 
Bill Clinton was informed about that by the CIA branch in 
Frankfurt in mid-April. The CIA, the FBI and the German Military 
Intelligence have launched a thorough investigation into the 
matter after it was established that a container with 4,158 bags 
of blood plasma suspected of being infected with the AIDS virus 
had been sent to Bosnian Moslem fighters. 
  The red alert was given when the wounded Moslem soldiers 
from 
central Bosnia, 243 of whom were later found to have been 
contaminated with the HIV virus, started arriving to a military 
hospital in Bad Told 80 km from Munich. Germany, which has so 
far whole-heartedly supported Bosnian Moslems, now insists that 
the United States immediately remove from its territory "the 
deadly cargo." The Turks, who had been helping their Moslem 
brethren in Bosnia in both troops and weapons, say it is out of 
the question that some of those who have tested positive for HIV 
be treated in Turkish hospitals. 
  Iran, which has so far vowed to send mujaheddin to kill all 
Serbs "in the name of Allah," has also flatly rejected to help. 
Although all German papers are bound to know about the deadly 
U.S. airdrops to Bosnian Moslems, they are keeping their mouths 
shut probably because no matter how much they would like it they 
cannot blame the Serbs for the terrible mistake of others, says 
POLITIKA EKSPRES in conclusion.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 1 (AFP) -- The head of the French 
army called Sunday [1 May] for a tougher line on a NATO air 
strike threat, amid increasing ceasefire violations and 
harassment of UN forces in Bosnia over the past two days. 
Admiral Jacques Lanxade, referring to a NATO ultimatum over 
attacks against UN-designated safe areas, said that if it was 
violated in any way: "France would recommend strikes." The most 
serious harassment in the last two days was a direct Bosnian 
Serb attack on UN tanks in northern Bosnia, UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] spokesman commander Eric Chaperon said. 
  He said UN Nordic battalion tanks reinforcing an observation 
post near the UN-designated safe area of Tuzla responded with 72 
tank rounds when attacked by Serbs. Chaperon said the Serbs 
fired four wire-guided anti-tank missiles which landed close to 
the tanks, porovoking the tanks to respond with 72 rounds, the 
most massive UNPROFOR retaliation so far. "The rockets were 
fired to hit. These are not toys. They did not miss their 
targets deliberately," he said. 
  No exact figures for Serb casualties in the incident were 
available, Chaperon said, but added that Serb military 
commanders had reported a number of dead and injured, as well as 
damage to equipment. In Sarajevo, "the usual ceasefire 
violations" had been reported, Chaperon said, indicating these 
were mostly exchanges of small arms fire. A French Puma 
helicopter was hit by small arms fire while approaching the 
airport Saturday. Meanwhile in Vitez, also a UN-designated area 
in central Bosnia, a rocket-propelled grenade landed 50 metres 
from the entrance to the base of the British UN batallion 
Saturday. 
  In Gorazde, small arms fire had continued despite the 
stand-off with NATO last week, and two Bosnian army mortar 
shells fell on Serb positions, Chaperon said. Sources in the 
region have indicated that about 100 armed Serbs were deployed 
in the region to protect the Serb population on the right bank 
of the river Drina. 
  "They are Serb militia, not soldiers. We do not have exact 
figures" for the number involved, Chaperon said. Meanwhile 
Admiral Lanxade, who arrived here Saturday, stressed that Paris 
backed strict adherence to the threat of air strikes for 
violations of the NATO ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs. 
  Talking to journalists at Sarajevo airport, Lanxade stressed 
that it was "absolutely clear that if the terms of the ultimatum 
are violated, France would recommend strikes." Informed sources 
said Lanxade discussed the issue with UNPROFOR commander General 
Sir Michael Rose when he met him here Sunday morning. A member 
of Lanxade's staff said the meeting was to "clear up any 
misunderstandings." He said there was a "need for mutual 
explanation. "The staff member said Rose's views "should be 
made more precise," because "he gives the impression of being so 
against strikes that he is removing their credibility entirely." 
  The French general stressed however that "the UN has not 
backed off, nor has there been a difference opinion with 
France... we must negotiate on the ground, and maintain the 
NATO pressure. Success on the ground depends on the combination 
of these two actions," he said, stressing that the West did not 
plan to "strike for striking's sake, but to lead to a 
resolution" of the conflict. Lanxade later left Sarajevo by 
helicopter bound for the Croatian port of Split, from where he 
will return to Paris.

Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. The letter reads: 
  Dear Mr. President, more than a month ago we signed the 
Washington agreement, which opened a new perspective for the 
development of relations between the Bosniak and Croat peoples, 
as well as Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Soon after this 
political document was adopted mutual Muslim-Croat clashes 
stopped and roads for humanitarian convoys have been opened to a 
certain extent. However, the implementation of other important 
provisions of this agreement, and the possibilities that it 
offers, are obviously (?late). 
  I would like to confirm in this letter our interest in a 
speedy and complete implementation of the Washington Agreement. 
Seeing that I am convinced that you share the same interest, 
would you please use the influence you certainly have in order 
to implement this agreement quickly and effectively. 
  I believe that delegations of Bosniaks and Croats should 
meet 
without further delay. The delegations should propose solutions 
to all remaining open issues, including the maps of the cantons, 
the personnel issues of the future government and presidency, 
the formation of the joint military command, and other issues, 
the letter stresses. Some of the priorities are also the 
adoption of a program [not specified], the return of refugees to 
their homes, and the opening of all communication routes. The 
delegations have met twice, but the importance and volume of 
work demand not a few hours, but a few days of work. After 
proposals and stands are agreed upon, an Assembly session should 
immediately be convened to approve the agreed issues. 
  I believe that we can count on your cooperation to curb the 
enemies of the Washington Agreement. Unfortunately, there are 
still such people, who, despite the efforts of the political 
leaders, have not stopped short of barbaric actions in the field 
in order to undermine and rekindle the conflicts. 
  Mr. President, I am also convinced that your soon arrival on 
the announced visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina would contribute to 
the realization of goals (?set out in this letter). 
  Please accept the expressions of my respect. This is said at 
the end of the letter sent to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
by Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency.

  [Excerpts] The main European and world ceremony celebrating 
international labor day on 1 May, was held in Sarajevo today. 
The secretary generals of the three largest trade union 
confederations in Europe and the world visited Sarajevo today 
for the occasion. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Ejup Ganic, member of the 
Bosnian presidency, also addressed the meeting on behalf of 
President Izetbegovic and the Bosnia-Herzegovina presidency. 
  [Begin Ganic recording] It is not by accident that the 
world's largest trade union confederations have chosen Sarajevo 
as the venue for this year's main May Day celebration. This 
reveals a bad conscience because the world has failed to do all 
that it can for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Workers, those who are 
least to blame for the failure to act, are doing this to catch 
the attention of UN politicians, politicians of all countries, 
people who hold the power. In the name of human solidarity, in 
the name of the moral and political principles they uphold, they 
should not have left a country of hard-working people, a country 
of culture, science, and work, to the tender mercies of the 
armed chetnik gangs. What is all the more humiliating is that 
this country and its people have been denied the right to defend 
themselves by the imposition of an unjust embargo on the import 
of arms. 
  The so-called protected area of Gorazde was defended by the 
courage of almost unarmed defenders who sustained the assaults 
by the aggressors equipped with (state-of-the-art) weapons of 
mass destruction. Those who prevented a more effective defense 
and protection of Gorazde and its residents are the accomplices 
of the crime in that town. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Army General Rasim Delic, chief of the General Staff 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, assessed the present military 
situation in our country speaking on Bosnia-Herzegovina 
television this evening: 
  [Begin Delic recording] Enemy forces are regrouping 
throughout the Bosnia-Herzegovina front. Some foreign agencies 
are reporting about regrouping in Posavina. This started before 
their reports. Namely, armored and mechanized forces from 
Krajina have started arriving. After Gorazde, and after the 
withdrawal from the Gorazde area, they are stepping up their 
reinforcement. The goal that the aggressor forces are trying to 
realize is well known: To widen the Brcko corridor. This 
regrouping is now taking place from Gradacac to Celic, i.e., 
along the entire Posavina section of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
front. 
  Given that we have been monitoring such events and taking 
appropriate measures I do not expect that they will surprise us 
in this respect. But one should say that the situation such as 
the one in Gorazde and earlier in Sarajevo, when the UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] was only taking over the protection of 
certain territories, creates conditions for the aggressors to 
concentrate large armored and mechanized units and even 
personnel in the specific areas that they chose as the target of 
their aggression. 
  Our demand has always been for the heavy artillery, as well 
as the armored and mechanized units of the two sides to be 
placed under effective control. Unfortunately, in both Sarajevo 
and Gorazde this did not happen and consequently there is a 
danger of additional enemy involvement in some of our other 
areas, taking into account the amount of heavy technology at the 
disposal of the Serbian aggressors. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 29 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the 
president of the people's assembly of the republic of Srpska, 
told SRNA [Bosnian Serb news] agency this evening that the Serb 
side would support Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's 
proposal on establishing a one-year cease-fire in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and on solving disputed issues through 
arbitration. Saying that Kozyrev's initiative "deserves great 
attention," Krajisnik added that the Serb side would support it 
"if arbitration agents who will reach a just solution are 
found." Krajisnik stressed that the Serb side believed that it 
was necessary to agree on a cessation of hostilities and replace 
the war with political negotiations, but without "prejudicing 
solutions." 
  "We would be ready to accept arbitration, but the Serbs have 
had negative experiences with the work of the international 
community which has on several occasions displayed bias and 
sided with the Muslims," the president of the republic of Srpska 
assembly said. "In any event, we advocate the establishing of 
peace and talks, but without a solution being imposed on any 
side in the conflict in former Bosnia-Herzegovina," Krajisnik 
said.

<F P=106> [By David Mason, PA News] </F>
  [Text] A British armoured column was held up at a Serb 
checkpoint near Gorazde today as the United Nations reported 
rising tension in the Muslim enclave. The 168-strong British 
force, including 32 Saxon armoured vehicles, was due to 
reinforce about 500 UN peacekeepers patrolling an increasingly 
unstable ceasefire around the town. But a spokesman at UN HQ in 
Sarajevo said it had been held up since the early hours at a 
Serb checkpoint at Rogatica, just north of the town. The 
contingent is mainly drawn from the Duke of Wellington's 
regiment, and its commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel David 
Santa-Olalla will take command of UN forces in the enclave when 
it arrives. 
  UN Protection Force spokesman Eric Chaperon said the 
situation in Gorazde was worsening and Muslim forces on Saturday 
fired two mortar rounds at the Bosnian Serbs. "The situation in 
Gorazde is getting unstable due to the increasing tension around 
the water plant, along the confrontation line north west of the 
town," he said. "Several small arms exchanges were reported in 
the area." 
  Both sides agreed a ceasefire after the Serbs lifted a 
month-long siege of the town in compliance with a Nato ultimatum 
to pull back. But UN officials said the Serbs had failed to 
withdraw all their infantry from a two-mile exclusion zone and 
Muslim-led forces were ignoring requests from peacekeeping 
troops in the area.

<F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Excerpt] Fascists from nearby hills carried out 
provocations against all the defense lines on the Gorazde 
battlefield yesterday. They shelled the commune's outskirts 
fiercely, and (Zasevi) and Brdarici in particular. UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] unit members are again acting without shame 
as not a single gesture of theirs shows that they belong to 
peace forces. Thus, in cooperation with the chetnik hordes, 
they are trying to evacuate ethnic Serb citizens from the very 
town center, but at the same time they are settling the 3-km 
zone with people from Serbia and Montenegro. To what extent the 
NATO ultimatum is being respected can be seen from the fact that 
three people were wounded in the town and its suburbs yesterday. 
  A general catastrophe is reigning in Gorazde at the moment. 
People have no food, no water, and no electricity. There are no 
medicines or first-aid kits. A veritable chaos reigns here. 
  Chetniks are still positioned 200 m away from the town 
center 
and any movement by Gorazde citizens means certain death at the 
hands of snipers. Two UNHCR convoys that arrived in Gorazde 
recently can suffice for the people to survive one day at the 
most. [passage omitted]

  [Text] After a two-day break, the radio bridge with 
Gorazde and Esad Ohranovic, chairman of the Executive Council of 
the Gorazde Region, and Dr. Alija Begovic, (?director) of the 
Gorazde hospital, has been established again. Here is a report 
by Senada Cumurovic: 
  [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] At the beginning of the radio 
link Sead Ohranovic said that it is mostly calm in Gorazde today 
although there are some chetnik provocations. A fighter of the 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina was killed by a sniper bullet. 
  [Ohranovic] Well, the chetniks have not withdrawn [words 
indistinct] 3 km and, in a way, we in Gorazde are not satisfied. 
There is now the problem, and an acute problem at that, of 
(?water), food, all that comes in the wake of the situation in 
which we find ourselves, and particularly the accommodation 
problem. 
  [Cumurovic] This is how Ohranovic commented on the recent 
statement by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] spokesman Eric 
Chaperon that our forces fired on UNPROFOR. 
  [Ohranovic] These reports are in no way correct. The 
chetniks have recently been using some ammunition, that is, 
explosive ammunition that has [words indistinct] to shoot behind 
one's back. Therefore, this is not true, and our forces are 
still positioned along the lines on which they were [words 
indistinct] the UN forces. It is exclusively members of the 
chetnik forces who are carrying out provocations in this area. 
  [Cumurovic] As regards weapons, even after the ultimatum 
expired, the chetniks did not withdraw their artillery from the 
20-km zone. As Ohranovic put it, there is confirmation that 
there is still some aggressor heavy artillery at Jabucko Sedlo, 
(Miljan), Mount Kozara, at the foot of Mount Kozara, and on the 
roads leading from (?Foca) and Pale. As regards the 
humanitarian situation, the food supplies are somewhat improved. 
  [Ohranovic] However, the greatest problems that the citizens 
of Gorazde are now facing are is the accommodation of the 
population that has been streaming from the occupied regions 
into the town and the problem of water. We are seeking the best 
solutions here and are insisting that the international 
organizations help solve the problem. The International Red 
Cross has tried to do something and has brought some equipment 
to supply at least the hospital with drinking water, that is, 
water for cleaning. However, the problem of the entire town has 
still not been solved. We are working together with the 
international organizations to solve the problem, but this is 
nevertheless going slowly. Gorazde's people are having a real 
problem with water and are using the murky waters of the River 
Drina. 
  [Cumurovic] Thanks to the packages of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres, the 
supplies of Gorazde and its hospitals with medicines have been 
improved, Dr. Alija Begovic said. However, he indicated a major 
health problem. 
  [Begovic] It seems that we are facing an epidemic of 
infectious hepatitis. We already have several cases of it in 
different parts of the town. In such unhygienic conditions, 
this will be fatal if something is not done urgently. 
  [Cumurovic] In three days, 265 wounded people have been 
evacuated from Gorazde but the need for further evacuation is 
still great. At this moment, UNPROFOR teams are visiting 
villages in the commune in order to transport people to Gorazde 
and then further on. Besides, in the town itself, 400 to 500 
wounded people are awaiting evacuation, Dr. Begovic said. 
  Journalists have wanted to know about the situation in the 
villages of (Zupcici) and [name indistinct] where the aggressor 
has brought in Serbian people. This is what Ohranovic had to 
say about this: 
  [Ohranovic] Yes, Serbian people have been settled in these 
villages that you mentioned. They are now living there under 
the excuse that these are their flats and their houses. [words 
indistinct] UNPROFOR to solve this problem but they have not 
helped us. 
  [Cumurovic] Apart from the civilians, so-called Serbian 
police have been deployed in (Zupcici) and [name indistinct]. 
In fact, what is involved are aggressor's soldiers who had been 
destroying Gorazde and who have now just changed uniforms. 
  At the end of the radio bridge, Ohranovic said that the 
security situation in Gorazde has nevertheless been stabilizing. 
A curfew between 2100 to 0400 has been introduced and life is 
returning to normal. [end recording]

  [Text] The chetniks today fired on a food convoy on Mount 
Igman with a machine gun. The aggressor has been intensively 
violating the cease-fire with all type of small arms around 
Sarajevo all day today. The chetniks were particularly 
frequently firing on Brijesce from [the Sarajevo suburb of] 
Nedzarici and Bozica [word indistinct]. 
  A similar situation was in [word indistinct], where (?two) 
grenades fired from the direction of Pergoj exploded, and in the 
Vrace area and Srpsko Brdo, where one civilian was wounded. 
This afternoon, a sniper was active at the junction of Tito 
Street and Djuro Djakovic Street. Citizens are warned to 
exercise maximum caution. 
  On the Vares-Olovo front, the aggressor is still attacking 
the defense lines with all types of weapons. Attacks were 
carried out on populated places in the Breza municipality from 
within the exclusion zone, from the areas of Tisovik, Brezovaca, 
Solakovici, Brdo, (?Halga), and Kostraca, as well as from 
Nabozici. No one was killed or wounded. 
  The Visoko front was today marked by chetnik attacks with 
anti-aircraft guns and machine guns and snipers on the 
Visoko-Busje road and Visoko's suburbs and center. All these 
attacks represent desperate moves by the aggressors since the 
lines of defense in the theater of operations of the 1st Army 
Corps remain stable and the morale and resolve of the defenders 
to persevere in the struggle until final victory remains high. 
  This was reported by the Information Service of the 1st Army 
Corps.

  [Text] Sarajevo, May 2 (AFP) -- Three shells exploded here 
Sunday in apparent violation of a ceasefire and a heavy weapons 
ban, the United Nations said. Two shells fell about 300 metres 
(yards) east of the Grbavica bridge, which links the downtown 
Serb-held district with the rest of the city that is controlled 
by the Moslem-dominated government army, according to Guy Vinet, 
a UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) officer. A third shell was 
later reported falling on the outskirts of the city. There were 
no immediate reports of injuries and Eric Chaperon, UNPROFOR 
spokesman, described the shelling as part of the usual 
cease-fire violations. Government and Serb forces, faced with a 
threat of NATO airstrikes, were ordered in February to place all 
heavy weapons under UN control or move them outside a 
20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone.

  [Excerpt] The chetniks today showed us yet again in the 
most brutal way that, as far as they were concerned, no UN 
decisions on protected areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina had any 
validity. Between 1500 and 1600 GMT this afternoon they fired 
several artillery shells on Tuzla. This attack against civilian 
targets caused fresh casualties: One 22-year-old girl was 
killed, one person seriously, and three lightly wounded.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 2 May within its 
regular 9-minute newscast carries several reports on the 
situation in the republic. 
  In his report on the situation in the Brcko region, Hamiz 
Deronjic says that "by bringing in reinforcement over several 
past days, as well as last night, the Serbian aggressor has 
carried out the strongest concentration of combat potential on 
the Brcko region since the beginning of the war. The 
Bijeljina-Brcko-Pelagicevo line has been simply (?clogged) with 
enemy tanks, transporters, [word indistinct], trucks, buses, 
vans, and (?luxurious) trains. The Serbian-Montenegrin 
aggressor has been transferring tanks, heavy artillery pieces, 
and blooded chetnik units [word indistinct] that took part in 
the barbarian attack on heroic Gorazde, to the (?key) point of 
the northern corridor before the free Brcko territory, which has 
not been protected by international resolutions." Further on in 
the report, Deronjic says that "in the last 24 hours, the 
shelling of the Brcko defense lines has intensified. The 
aggressor has been using recoilless guns, mortars, and Praga and 
Bofors weapons. The regions of Poderiste, Tulmovici, and the 
Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line were exposed to the most intensive 
enemy fire yesterday evening." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports that "in the past 24 hours, the 
joint 
aggressors failed to essentially change their activity on the 
Bihac region. They continued attacking and provoking attacks at 
almost all lines of separation in the zones covered by the 5th 
Corps of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Headquarters of 
the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. Karadzic's terrorists were 
unselectively shelling the defense lines, particularly on the 
Bihac section of the front and they also shelled the suburbs 
there. On the Grmusko-Srbljanski Height, they acted with 
antiaircraft and anti-armor weapons. They shelled defense lines 
as well as civilian districts on the free Bosanska Krupa 
territory and (Buzim) region. Sniper activity was intensified 
on all lines. The members of the Kladusa [Fikret Abdic's] 
private paramilitary have, all the time, been firing mortars and 
mountain guns from the strongholds in Donja (Lucka), (Trska), 
and Golubovici, thus attacking Todorovo, the general region of 
Krivaja, (Tesigrad), and Liskovac in the Cazin Commune. 
Reliable reconnaissance reports forecast preparations for new 
attacks both from the Kladusa Commune and the region of the 
so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina." 
  Abdulah (Vitanovic) reports on "fierce chetnik artillery 
attacks on the front lines and deep into the free Kalesija 
territory continued yesterday and last night. They acted from 
all strongholds and with all available weapons. They launched 
more than 100 destructive projectiles, whereby one person was 
seriously wounded and several houses completely destroyed." 
Further on, (Vitanovic) says that "during last night, the enemy 
continued occasional artillery attacks and early this morning 
the region of Donji (Krajinci) was exposed to fierce attacks 
with Bofors weapon (?from Vis). Later this morning, shelling of 
the outskirts of the commune and occasional attacks with 
machine-guns and antiaircraft weapons along the entire front 
line has continued. At the end of this report from Kalesija, 
let me say that, apart from offensive artillery-infantry 
attacks, the enemy is also carrying out a regrouping of manpower 
and bringing military hardware, particularly to the regions of 
(Vis) and (Visocek)." 
  A report by the Information Service of the 4th Corps says 
that "while trying to cross the dam of the Mostar Hydroelectric 
Power Plant over to the side controlled by the Army of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, two Italian journalists were 
killed and one seriously wounded when they stepped on a mine 
field. No details of this tragic event, which took place on the 
territory controlled by the HVO, are known. By the way, the 
zone covered by the 4th Corps was calm and without the usual 
combat operations."

  [Text] Doboj, April 29 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces continued 
Friday strong artillery and infantry attacks on the Serb 
settlements and positions of the army of the Bosnian Serb 
republic (R.S.) in northern Bosnia -- around the towns of Doboj 
and Teslic, the R.S. military sources set out. Artillery fire 
on Teslic caused considerable material damage, a statement said. 
It also noted that one member of a Moslem commando-terrorist 
group was liquidated and several were wounded when this group 
attempted to infiltrate the Serb territory around Teslic. All 
the Moslem attacks were repelled, and the Moslem forces forced 
to withdraw, the statement said. 
  The Serbs in Doboj have been for over a month under 
sustained 
Moslem fire and suffered high casualties among the civilian 
population. As part of a general offensive on the Serb 
territories launched in late March, the Moslems especially 
stepped up combat activity against Doboj in an attempt to cut 
the Serb corridor in northern Bosnia linking eastern and western 
parts of the R.S. 
  The Moslem forces opened antiaircraft artillery and infantry 
fire also on the positions of the R.S. army around Srbobran 
(formerly Donji Vakuf) in central Bosnia, the statement said.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1000 GMT on 29 Apr 94 carries in 
its regular 10-minute newscast two reports on fighting in the 
republic. 
  Gorazde correspondent Fahrudin Bekic reports on the 
situation 
in the town and says that "the chetniks have withdrawn outside 
the 3-km exclusion zone on the left bank of the Drina River, but 
on the right bank, they are still on the positions that they 
occupied before the arrival of the UN Protection Forces. It is 
true that they are quiet and there is no sniper and antiaircraft 
activity in the town and surrounding villages. However, there 
is large-scale looting. They [Serbs] are systematically taking 
everything from the villages of (?Bubijer) and Fazlagici, and 
there is sporadic torching of property. The chetniks on the 
northwestern part of the front used artillery to target civilian 
targets in Brdarici, [name indistinct], and (?Unje). Moreover, 
they attempted an infantry breakthrough in the region on 
Brdarici." 
  Mirudin Aldobasic, correspondent from the 7-South Operative 
Group Information Service, reports that "a large concentration 
of tanks and other armored hardware has been sighted in the 
areas of Putnikovo Brdo, Plane, and Usce, and artillery on the 
northern and western parts of the front, particularly in the 
wider areas of Kriz, Kalosevic, and the Tesanj-Teslic 
demarcation lines. The aggressor is also carrying out 
large-scale regrouping on the western slopes of Mt. Ozren and is 
directing the massive equipment toward (?Sevadlije), Jagotic 
Polje, Srbuk, and Maglaj. Overnight and early this morning, the 
Serbian terrorists have been perpetrating constant small arms' 
provocations. Snipers are also active on most of the front."

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by Milan </F>
Rusko; place and date not given: "Presenting Slovakia 
Correctly"] 
  [Text] Diplomacy is one of the most important instruments 
for shaping opinion about Slovakia throughout the world. 
Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan expressed his views on this and 
other Slovak foreign policy tasks in an interview for PRAVDA. 
  [Rusko] Shortly after entering office, you expressed the 
view that assisting Slovakia's economy is also a task for our 
foreign policy. How can your department fulfill this task? 
  [Kukan] I am convinced that highlighting the economic 
dimension of foreign service work is one of our most pressing 
tasks. Our representative offices must become more actively 
involved in looking for ways to help the Slovak economy. This 
means adopting a pragmatic and new course of action, perhaps 
even to the detriment of traditional diplomacy, toward these 
issues. Apart from emphasis on the comprehensive functioning of 
our diplomatic service, we are also orienting our ambassadors 
and other diplomats toward forging intensive contacts with 
business circles and the financial sphere in host countries and 
toward increasing the information available to potential 
partners. Presenting Slovakia and its domestic political 
situation correctly and objectively is essential because foreign 
investors, in considering activity in our country, want to know 
what they are getting themselves into and that they are making a 
purposeful investment. Therefore, the country's political 
stability is also important. 
  [Rusko] What do you think of the stage the Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) has reached? Has it 
not already passed its zenith? 
  [Kukan] This question, for example, came up in discussion 
during my recent visit to Canada. In my opinion, the CSCE is 
still an important institution; it has not yet exhausted its 
potential. It is necessary to vitalize its activity, especially 
in maintaining peace on the continent and in preparing and 
dispatching groups of observers or delegations to areas of 
conflict. The CSCE can play a positive role there, even given 
the existence of other mechanisms. It is necessary to 
institutionalize its mechanisms more thoroughly. There was often 
a lack of consensus in decisionmaking in the past. Perhaps for 
this reason the impression was given that it is declining in 
importance. I think it could still do a great deal. 
  [Rusko] Do you think that, in time, it could also have its 
own military-security structures alongside NATO and the Western 
European Union? 
  [Kukan] This is highly unlikely. 
  [Rusko] Various points of view are also being expressed 
about the justification for the Visegrad Four (the Czech 
Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia). What is your view? 
  [Kukan] In our opinion, the Visegrad Four should continue to 
function as a free alliance, without establishing institutions. 
This alliance could be used for consultations and for 
coordinating certain foreign policy steps. Representatives from 
the individual member countries have differing views on the 
justification for the Visegrad Four, but, as long as the 
grouping exists, Slovakia will advocate that it continues to 
function. 
  [Rusko] At the recent meeting involving seven presidents in 
Litomysl, it became apparent that there is no unanimous 
interpretation of the political term "Central Europe." Lech 
Walesa at least twice publicly expressed his opposition to using 
this term. Some others admitted that it is, to say the least, 
difficult to precisely define this term in view of the 
political, but especially economic, differences among the 
individual countries in it. What is your interpretation? 
  [Kukan] The term "Central Europe" has not really been 
defined precisely. In the wake of the political changes on the 
continent and the eradication of political bipolarity, this term 
began to be employed instead of the former ideological term 
"East Europe." At first, international organizations began to 
speak about "Central and East Europe," and now they only speak 
about "Central Europe," but no one can say what belongs there. 
It is possible to speak about Central Europe as a free and, in 
specific instances of economic, political, and security 
contacts, purposefully perceived subregion of the Continent of 
Europe in which more intensive relations could be developed. We 
are interested in them, and we consider them to be a form of 
rapprochement with the whole of Europe. After all, our 
relations--for example, with the countries that belong to the 
European Union and with the other countries preparing for 
entry--have been defined. Similarly, in the security sphere, we 
have acknowledged the Partnership for Peace--our presentation 
document should be ready in the very near future--as our road 
toward NATO. It is unequivocal. 
  [Rusko] However, because of these very objectives of certain 
countries, Russia has recently modified its stance. It has 
modified it with regard to the Partnership for Peace and also, 
it seems, with regard to NATO. What is the attitude adopted by 
our foreign policy toward the topical perceptions of Russian 
diplomacy? 
  [Kukan] We have emphasized many times in our talks with our 
partners in Europe and overseas--and we concurred in this--that 
our interest lies in ensuring that the situation in Russia is 
stable and that the proreform and prodemocratic forces prevail 
and govern society. From this point of view, it is essential to 
keep on emphasizing that our interest in integration with NATO 
and other European structures does not mean we have any hostile 
intentions toward Russia. On the contrary, there is room for 
cooperation with Russia, especially in the economic sphere. 
Naturally, we see a focal point in this, but we also want to 
have normal mutual political relations at the level of sovereign 
states and corresponding to the appropriate norms of 
international law and diplomacy. 
  [Rusko] We have good relations with all neighboring 
states; only in our relations with Hungary are certain elements 
of tension palpable. In your opinion, how could we get rid of 
this tension? 
  [Kukan] By means of a calm, matter-of-fact, and continuous 
dialogue that would create a favorable atmosphere for gradually 
resolving the issues on which we have different views. We want 
to emphasize that the Slovak side is ready for such a dialogue. 
  [Rusko] During your recent visit to the United States, you, 
according to the U.S. press, also discussed the sale of products 
from the Slovak arms industry. Could you tell our readers about 
the outcome of these talks? 
  [Kukan] In this case, the reports were distorted. Within 
the framework of my program, I had lunch in Washington with 
eight representatives of the U.S. press, actually from 
influential dailies such as THE WASHINGTON POST, THE NEW YORK 
TIMES, and so on, and we spoke about all sorts of things. We 
also discussed arms sales; they asked me about this, and I 
explained to them the kind of problems we have with conversion 
and what the more than 90-percent reduction in production 
compared with 1989 has meant for Slovakia. And, within the 
framework of the general conversation, I told them that the 
government is considering a partial renewal of production and 
possible arms exports, but we will not export them to high-risk 
regions of conflict. I said this to U.S. journalists, but I did 
not negotiate with the U.S. side about any arms sales. 
  [Rusko] A contingent of Pakistani troops is to come to 
Slovakia and will undergo training here for service in UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Force] units. 
  [Kukan] I discussed these issues with UN officials during my 
recent visit to the United States. They assessed positively our 
willingness to provide this opportunity. They noted it, and 
Slovakia has thus scored a few points. I view this as 
assistance and cooperation within the framework of the United 
Nations. 
  [Rusko] Since we are talking about the United Nations, has a 
decision been made yet on Slovakia's permanent representative, 
who will take over from you? 
  [Kukan] No decision has been made yet. Someone has just been 
nominated; therefore, I will not mention any names. However, we 
envisage that he would take up his post sometime in July so that 
he can become familiar with the working environment and 
conditions in the United Nations before the start of the next UN 
General Assembly session in September. 
  [Rusko] Even before you entered office, there was talk about 
reducing the number of Slovak representative offices. What are 
the prospects? 
  [Kukan] We would not like to reduce their number. We proceed 
from the premise that the number of representative offices--63, 
these include embassies, permanent missions, consulates general, 
and consulates--is not many. After all, countries comparable 
with us perhaps have more representative offices than the Slovak 
Republic. We are under a great deal of pressure; it is possible 
that we will have to adopt some budget measures, but we want, to 
say the least, to maintain this number of representative offices. 
  [Rusko] Preparing for the conference to be held at the end 
of May in Paris on issues concerning stability in Europe is one 
of the topical tasks facing our diplomatic service. What would 
the Slovak side like to come up with there? 
  [Kukan] In preparing for this important event, we are 
proceeding from the premise that the Pact on Stability should 
respect the interests of all of the participants on an equal 
basis. There should be neither "victors" nor "vanquished" in it.
